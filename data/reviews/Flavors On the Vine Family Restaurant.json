{"text":"I often eat here. The prices are reasonable, and the is good. What I like best is the all you can eat fish fry on Fridays.  The fish is excellent. Their salad and soup bar is also exceptional."}
{"text":"Slow, incompetent service delivered with a snarl. My family will not back."}
{"text":"I must have passed this place a million times.  Okay not quite a million but you get it.  So one day I decide let me give this place a try.  I love breakfast and this place did not disappoint.  The menu offers breakfast lunch and dinner specials all the time.  If you have not given this place a try you should."}
{"text":"Food is good and the m-f specials are a great deal! Have been going here for a long time and will continue."}
{"text":"We used to go there for breakfast on the weekends almost every week but hadn't been lately. See under new management. Went last Sunday and place wasn't crowded but it took 30 minutes from the time we sat down til we received our breakfast. - Not Satisfactory since it used to be 5 minutes. And toast was cold."}
{"text":"Good, cheap food... Not sure why there are so many negative comments on the service, I've never had a problem."}
{"text":"I probably won't go again unless in a pinch for diner food. Don't see that happening though.  Pros: -it's a diner  Cons: -a little overpriced but not MUCH.  -the waitress/service is HORRIBLE (hey management, hire more people you cheap-asses) -the credit card system forces you to tell the cashier how much of a tip you want to leave...come on guys...get with it.  The food wasn't good. It wasn't poison but not one aspect of it was done correctly (think breakfast at a diner as far as what was on the plate). Parking is in the rear and a little confusing as far as finding your way in (there is a door in the rear but there is a gauntlet of seated customers to walk through to get to the front.   I just think the owner needs to pull their head out of their a$# is all...."}
{"text":"Worst meal and service I have ever had. I had a the cheeseburger which had no taste and the bread tasted moldy. My son had a grilled cheese which I tasted and spit out it was disgusting. My friend who was with me got the potato skins which was not even cooked  the potato was still hard. The salad bar was okay. The service I had to ask for a water three times. She asked if we wanted a refill which we stated yes and she never came back then proceeded to tell us she worked 14 hours that day because someone called off so she can't be held accountable for her mistakes. I will never go back there ever again and I would suggest not to waste  your money. Wish I would have waited the 25 minutes to get a table at Anthony's."}
{"text":"I used to be in here all the time. It is still good. Service is always very good but the food itself is a little M'eh for me these days. It is expensive for what it is. Not bad though and definitely worth an occasional visit."}
{"text":"Thought we give this place a whirl today for breakfast, well we decided on the 8.99 breakfast buffet that from jump was poorly managed no eggs for 20 mins and the egg Benedict (yep only one left) was so hard a knife wouldn't cut the muffin. So settled for some yummy home fries and some out of a can sausage gravy  ( gfs brand is my safe bet ). Very disappointing that offering such a small variety of items that places couldn't put a little more effort or fresh made into it. First visit and not sure if we would come try any menu items as the overall place needs some polite staff and a good cleaning as the entry way was full of trash and leaves then your having to use bowls at a buffet due to no plates and the place was not even half full so being busy wont cut it as to why bowls are out for a buffet.  Please step back and see what your offering to your patrons and maybe improve on it and you could have something much better.   Update decided after two so so breakfast we would go try the ayce fish and salad bar!  Don't !!!  Lets see the salad bar the macaroni salad had been sitting out there so long most of the noodles were rock hard, the pudding had a dark film on top from drying out now lets talk about the little choices on the salad side let alone old wilted items , then their is the soup if you found a clean bowl with no dried on food then you got a choice of four soups two cream soups browned from sitting all day or soggy mushy chicken noodle. Now the fish fry sad is a good way to express it or soggy nasty poor excuse of food.  This place needs to get its act together serve food not gfs crap and get staff that does more then sit at the counter chatting. We will not be back unless ownership changes or earth is being invaded !"}
{"text":"My husband and I discovered this place two weeks ago and what a wonderful discovery. The menu is accommodating for every craving and pallet. Although we can pull away from the breakfast menu, everything looks good. The service is great. They know the regulars and are very polite. If ever you are on vine St in Euclid stop in you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food portions and prices are quite good for a family style restaurant. The service, on the other hand , is practically non-existent. Sit at the counter, if you are wishing to be totally ignored."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular here,  as did my whole family.  The last few times however the service has been awful.  We sat in the side room at a both.  The waitress leaned over the back of the booth to drop us our menus and drinks.. Not the extra two steps to the side. He took our order from there,  ignored us for the rest of the time we were there.  Never got a drink refill and  was not very friendly and almost rather rude.   Last time I was there to pick up my to go order,  she was ringing me out then two other people came up behind me and she told me to wait while she rung them out first. I had limited time and was disregarded.  breakfast was good,  anything else is subpar.   Anthony's across the street has great breakfast fo nascent prices and excellent service."}
{"text":"I came to this place because I was told I had to try it. I got a cheeseburger, and split some food with my party too. It's EXTREMELY cheap in price. Making it a place you could eat at daily if you didn't want to cool.  The atmosphere was much like any other family restaurant, nothing special but comforting. I enjoyed it, and I expect I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast!   Great selection of eggs, meats, potatoes, and griddle offerings.  Staff is very friendly and service has always been excellent.  The eggs Benedict are excellent, as are the biscuits and gravy.  Eggs are always cooked as ordered."}
{"text":"breakfast food - yumma. Lunch and Dinner - AWFUL ....their salad bar...well I've had better salad in jail!  JKJK!  But the service is AMAZING!   Unbelievable great amazing service!   Seriously I've been going since I was a little girl in the 80's .... It's the local breakfast joint for Greaselake Natives!   It's home. It's family...it's HOME!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. People who are leaving negative reviews have unreal expectations for a place like this.  The service has always been friendly, sure they don't always ask you how are you, where did you go on vacation or ask about your blood type. I don't have an issue with them just asking my drink, my order, asking if I need anything else and if everything is good. They are prompt and down to business. I don't go out to eat to chat it up with staff so this suits me perfectly. I've also seen the staff absolutely chat it up with others while I'm in there, so I think a lot of people on here have unusually high expectations for a diner.  Now the food, the fries are battered first and totally delicious.  The tj 1/2 lb cheese burger, shockingly good! The gyro, good but not to write home about, the Ruben is a typical favorite of mine. My mother often gets the fried fish, which has always been great and perfectly cooked (granted we aren't getting any fancy types, usually a fish sandwich or the special). She has also enjoyed the eggplant in the past.  The salad bar is kind of a buzz kill, the soups are alright, I guess they can satisfy the craving. This is just really if you want a healthier side to your meal than fries, don't go expecting anything grand from the salad bar!  The prices are fair not dirt cheap but everyone can eat easily for under $10.   I go here every time I'm in town and just want something quick simple and no fuss."}
{"text":"an ok alternative if Anthony's across the way is packed & you do not want to wait .. same type of fare .. Anthony's quality is a bit better .. went here on a Friday nite & they offered a king cut of prime rib for $15.99 which included soup + salad bar + dessert .. half the price of Anthony's .. but again, quality is not the same but certainly edible .. a few things were wrong on our order such as vegetable + bread selection but we just ate what we were given .. would probably return but Anthony's in that area still remains first pick"}
{"text":"Most of the food is great. Breakfast is the best. The salad bar includes some good homemade soup, but the salad bar itself is pretty lackluster--I wonder about the freshness and how long they keep stuff before throwing it away, because it's filled with some very odd choices that the greater portion of the public wouldn't put on their salad. Things like, kidney and garbanzo beans, cold spaghetti tossed with some black olives and Italian dressing (yuck), canned fruit salad... Even the lettuce has brown, curled up edges. Also, they need to get some new booths and carpeting, It's rather annoying to sit down in a booth that has duck-tape across a big crack in the seat, then sink to the floor because the springs have outlasted the frame. The carpet is a bit sticky, too. Just saying."}
{"text":"Great Food. Fun entertainments for kids and senior citizens. My wife and I were in surprized with music entertainment while we dine.  Great soup and salad. Atmosphere is great. Price is very affordable to have a great meal."}
{"text":"Went to Flavors on the Vine for the first time in a few years last week. It made me remember why I stopped going. The baked Orange Roughy, which cost over $11.00 was so overcooked it was actually crunchy. My husband's veal was terrible. My one daughter french toast with sausage. The sausage tasted \"gamey\" which is a first and my other daughter's meatball was so inedible I actually spit it into a napkin after I tasted it. This place has really gone downhill. The bill came to $38.00 which for a place like Flavors on the Vine is way too much. The only good thing was our waitress, Kathy. She was funny and nice. I will not return"}
{"text":"Dependable, simple diner style food, good service, reasonably priced.  Perhaps the best eggplant parm I've had in years.  Burgers always perfectlu cooked."}
{"text":"My brother and I were in the area and decided to give FONTV a try since we were passing by.   This diner is located in a a small two restaurant building.  It's kind of spartan inside,  with plenty of seating. There is also a soup & salad buffet at the front of the dining room.  When we entered,  we were greeted and told we could sit where we like. The woman who greeted us asked if we'd like something to drink. \"Two coffees and ice water please\".  A couple minutes later,  the same person returned with the beverages and without a thought proceeded to serve all of the drinks by grasping (even doing it twice after spilling some coffee) the top of the cups/glasses.  This is basic service 101 service here. A server should NEVER serve drinks by grasping the rims of the glass. Especially a server who also repeatedly coughed into her hands and touched her face & hair. .. Yuck!  Our server then arrived a few minutes later. I couldn't tell you her name,  because she never offered it.  In less than a minute after the menus were placed,  she eagerly asked if we were ready to order. We politely said we hadn't looked at them yet.  The menu is very large. Breakfast is served all day,  but the prices change at 11am. As in they increase several dollars. We were 20 minutes past the cut off. Too bad for us.  We settled on basic breakfast plates,  in consideration to the cooks going into lunch service. Eggs/home fries (they turned out to be hash browns),  bacon & toast for me. The same for my brother,  except with french toast.  The place was seemingly not busy,  but the food still took over fifteen minutes to arrive. Not terrible,  but slow for the volume.  In the meantime we each visited the rest rooms in turn to wash our hands.  The men's restroom is dirty,  the dining room is cruddy. The floors,  glass surfaces and dividing panels are all in need of cleaning.  Here's the trouble with a dirty front of the house in a restaurant. If the front,  where guests can easily see is dirty,  you can bet the back of the house (that guests can't easily see)  is dirty as well. This place isn't filthy,  just unkempt.  The service was poor. We did get a check back to ask \"is everything ok? \". Yeah, everything is \"OK\"... but it ain't great. No offer of fresh coffee,  despite the cup being pushed to the table's edge in hopes.  The food was \"ok\" too. Not what we wanted,  but hey who wants to pay $10 for a breakfast that cost $6 just 20 minutes ago.  We finally got that coffee warm-up after asking.   Something I wanted to mention directly to the staff. Be more respectful of the CUSTOMER. We don't want to hear negative shift crap,  snarky gossip,  off color comments about other guests,  complaining, or any other personal conversation. We also don't want to hear power tools being used for several minutes while dining. Don't eat in front of the customers,  it's  unprofessional. (Which I don't think they're striving for at FOTHV).   Also,  either turn down the AC temperature on 90° + days, or fix said AC.   Sweating while eating warm food sucks. Especially when you're not eating what you want,  because the price increased literally minutes before you entered. Who does that?  Apparently FOTHV does!  You may think my standards are high, they are. I only expect friendly prompt service,  cleanliness,  fair & consistent menu prices,  basic service competence (no hand on serving surfaces, very basic) and proper climate control.  The \"host?  greater? cashier? hand atop beverage server?!  asked me at the register ( and every other customer) \"was everything OK? \".  I told her \"no comment\". She said \" uh oh,  was something wrong? \" I simply said... \"Read it in the Yelp review later\".  So here it is.  Sincerely,  A never returning customer.   P. S. I still tipped 20%,  because I was also a server once. A much, much, MUCH better server... who never ever put my fingers atop a glass again after a Maitre'D nearly drew blood after witnessing me do so."}
