{"text":"I've watch D-Beatstro improved their offerings and options over the last few months and it's been great to see them grow from sort of disorganized but charming to really having a solid menu, kitchen, and coffee set up. They have a nice variety of baked goods, occasionally have gluten-free options too for those of you that need/want them, and herbalist blended teas available. But my favourite thing now is their brunch, because it's good, really good.

Seating is comfortable and well spaced out, so if you're tired of sharing elbow room with other folks during weekend brunches - this might be a great spot to check out. The restaurant and cafe is also wheelchair and/or mobility device accessible with a ramp outside (they also have an accessible washroom.)

The folks here make a great soy latte, and why anyone would recommend going to a Starbucks or Tim Hortons over even a non-dairy latte, I don't understand, but Kevin S. you do you. They also have a variety of other fun drinks - like hot chocolate, white hot chocolate, matcha lattes, and other surprises in store for you.  They also \"only\" have soy, almond, coconut, and cashew. Oh no, too many options? Branch out a little.

Check em out for brunch or during the week."}
{"text":"My first time at this establishment (overdue!) and I will certainly be back. 
They had a great selection of food and drink. 
Fantastic and friendly service. 
I enjoyed a superb cup of coffee and was offered several different non-dairy milks for it. 
I accompanied that with my first ever pumpkin pop-tart which has set the new standard for any and all future treats to enjoy with a cuppa!
I'm looking forward to seeing live entertainment there at some point in the future too, as they have space for that as well. 
I would recommend this establishment without hesitation."}
{"text":"BEST tofu scramble I've ever had...I like it more than scrambled eggs. They have converted me. I've seen the light."}
{"text":"Going to D-Beatstro was the most unpleasant experience I had in Toronto since I moved here. Went there to have brunch with my wife on January 1st and the place was crowded. We had to wait for more than one hour to be seated -- which is kind of OK, even though it was after 1PM and we were really hungry, it was the first day of the year and we were expecting some delay. However the servers seemed completely lost and unprepared to deal with it. They kept asking us and the other clients who was next in line instead of doing it themselves, as any other server in any other restaurant would do. When we finally got seated, they served us some tea that was ordered by another table -- which, by the way, was seated AFTER us. The couple in that other table got their drinks and food even before someone noticed that we wanted to order our breakfast. We tried to call one of the waitress but they just ignored us. When the couple mentioned before was already paying for their meal, we decided to cancel our order and go somewhere else. It was 3PM and we hadn't got anything to eat. The waitress then realised that the paper with our order had fallen down from the order queue and the guys in the kitchen hadn't even started doing our food. I'm never returning to this place again and I would never recommend it to anyone else."}
{"text":"Love this place. Their root beer cupcakes are frickin' delicious. And it's a safe space for lots of groups of people. And they have great events. And they host and support a lot of local artists. AND it's one of the only places in the area that I can find delicious vegan eats and a variety of milk alternatives! 

(How is an \"elite\" Yelper actually recommending Tim Horton's or Shitbucks over a lovely, independent vegan cafe?!)"}
{"text":"Pretty chill spot. Not pretentious like some vegan places can be. We went for brunch. Our server couldn't answer any (ANY) of our questions but did find out answers for us. They use daiya cheeze, Yves fake meat, in-house seitan sausages, and then tofu for all the egg substitutes. Huevos rancheros was pretty delicious - great flavour, especially beans and vegan sour cream - but it wasn't hot, just mildly warm food. But the food came quickly. They also had cool art by a local artist on exhibit, which is great."}
{"text":"I mean, a punk rock vegan café? This place was basically made for me. What's not to love? Hip artwork, King of the Hill marathons (follow them on Facebook to know what time it is), creative desserts (have you tried the pop tarts yet?), and great coffee make this a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"I went last weekend and had the vegan grilled cheese and tomato soup. It was honestly the best grilled cheese I've ever had! The pastries are also mouth-watering (try the whoopie pie or the chocolate peanut butter cake!) I swear, I could have eaten everything on the menu. Great, cool atmosphere and I can't wait to go back for brunch! :)"}
{"text":"I was so impressed with this place. And it's hard to impress me, food-wise. We had the hash, pizza grilled cheese and a side of tofu scramble. Best tofu scramble in the city and honestly I will gladly make the trip over from the east side again. Friendly, responsive service as well.

Yes, the drip coffee wasn't good but It's hard to find a non-coffeecentric diner in the city that has decent coffee. Espresso drinks were probably a different story,  can't comment. If you're in this café, eat the food! Don't worry about the coffee. There are like three painfully hipster places right around the corner if you're desperate.

So happy my partner found this place. Mmmm. Dammit, now I'm hungry again."}
{"text":"Funky spot, great service, don't be scared off by the all-black interior! So glad to have a vegan brunch place not too far from where I live. Ordered the Toast with the Most which comes with french toast, home fries, sausage and fruit. Was expecting more classic thick-cut slices of bread coated in a vegan batter of some kind, but the french toast was a little disappointing in that it was pretty thin. Flavour was good but overall less satisfying than I hoped. The sausage was ok but even for being vegan it was really tough and chewy - they might want to work on texture! Homefries were really good as was the coffee! I also tried a bit of my mom's order of the veggie hash which was SO GOOD, would probably order that if I came back. Flavours and texture were great. Also tried a bit of the tofu scramble which also had great flavour.

Overall not a bad little spot but I think there is still room for improvement with some items on the menu. I hope these guys stick around!"}
{"text":"Really great staff. Very casual, easy-going place. Coffees/lattes are good, the desserts are always good, and their tofu scramble (brunch) really is amazing. I had the breakfast burrito there once and it was delicious. The rest of the food I've tried there is just okay...the sandwiches are tasty but not filling. They have fresh juices for reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great place for beats and vegan treats! 

Friendly people with great music and wifi connection is always great!

Also beautiful decor! Love the milkcrates, wall picture frame details and gorgeous wooden bartop!"}
{"text":"Best vegan baking in Toronto, friendly staff, warm and open atmosphere.

Go out of your way to come here and I promise you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm a brunch person, and this has one of the best vegan brunches in the city - honestly in general just one of the best brunches in the city, vegan or not.  I love the vibe of the place itself, very punk and also supports a lot of local artists.  Pretty much all the art on display is for sale, and they have a side shelf where you can purchase vegan soaps, buttons, zines, patches etc.  They also do music shows and sometimes even community workshops at night!  

There's always been space whenever I've stopped in for brunch, never had to line up.  It's very close to Lansdowne station so convenient to get to when you're half awake in the morning.  They also have baked goods (which are very good) like donuts and cupcakes, and recently started offering a lunch menu.  Haven't had much of it yet, but what I did have (the Philly cheese seitan sandwich) was amazing.  Servers are really nice and I've never had a bad time here.  If you want delicious food, want to support a local business and community space, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Yelp says I have to write more than \"Obviously the best place in the world!! \" for this to qualify as a review so ..

If you're looking for the best coffee ever at the nicest cafe this side of the Atlantic with the greatest music ever conceived and served by the nicest humans to ever grace us with their presence then GO HERE.

You won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"Their breakfast is wonderful with all of the flavours I'm looking for. Perfectly balanced on the plate and at a reasonable price as well."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday around 10:30am in search of some vegan brunch. We sat ourselves at a table, and though there was only one other couple in the restaurant, it was a bit before we were greeted. The server took another fifteen minutes or so to return and take our order. The server was polite but didn't seem to have a good understanding of the menu.

I ordered a Reuben with Mac and cheese on the side which came out shortly after I ordered. The sandwich was pretty tasty and the *smoked* tempeh made it better than another tempeh Reuben I've tried. The Mac n cheese had a nice texture but was a bit sweet to me. It tastes like the cheese sauce might've been made with coconut milk. I added some hot sauce to it which rounded it out nicely and added the perfect kick. for dessert, I got a s'mores bar to go. It's basically a chocolate chip cookie bar with marshmallows sprinkled in. The bar was moist and chewy with just the right amount of marshmallows. I really enjoyed it and thought the strawberry streusel looked great as well.

This place is good and has a lot of potential but could use some fine tuning with the service."}
{"text":"The best cold brew!! Fancy vegan treats, monthly art shows and live events. My new favourite place"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their vegan food is amazing, and they have awesome shows and screenings! It's a good spot for events and big groups. they also sell their wall arts."}
{"text":"The host was kind. The atmosphere in the restaurant with clothing to purchase, vegan soap, vegan shampoo bar, vegan lip balm, etc. i ordered the slaw burger with BBQ with a side of coleslaw salad and was delightful! I also ordered a marble cake with butter cream which was too sugary for me. next time i will not get dessert with buttercream- just too sweet for me! i definitely recommend anyone try out D-beastro!"}
{"text":"OMFG! Healthy + unhealthy vegan foods for reasonable prices?  While waiting to meet up with a friend, I decided to walk down Bloor street and see what vegan options are there.  

There were tons but I realized I had D-Beastro bookmarked so I walked from Dovercourt to  Landsdowne.  From what I understand, everything is vegan and brunch runs from 10-4 pm on weekends and they have gluten free options as well.  

Adorning the place was some interesting artwork with the Zodiac signs as the labels and the entire place had a very down-to-earth hipster vibe.  I liked the vibe there and it's cool to hang out, but it wasn't the cleanest place either.  I understand the hipster vibe, but you can't have cups on the floors either (it was hiding underneath the couch).

In terms of the food, it was amazing.  All plates looked like they were between $9 to $13, which is very reasonable considering a lot of vegan places like to overcharge for food with entrees costing $18+ with small portions.  I ordered the Philly \"Cheese\"steak with hash brown fries as the options.  So unhealthy. So good.  So greasy.  So good yet so bad.  I believe it was $11.  Given the price, I thought I would need a side so I stupidly ordered the vegan sausage for $3 (you get 2).  You couldn't even tell this was vegan food.  It was so delicious. The food took a bit longer than usual to come out, but it was well worth the wait and the waitress with the British accent was very friendly as well. 

The \"steak\" was made with seitan and the cheese was house made \"cheese\" sauce.  Amazing.

Verdict: I'll definitely be back.  Great place for vegan food."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite places for brunch in Toronto. I've been here three times for brunch and was never disappointed. I've tried the Deluxe Breakfast, Monte Cristo Sandwich and Philly Cheesesteak.

For the Deluxe Breakfast, their tofu scramble has a nice light curry kick to it and their housemade seitan sausages have a very good flavour and chewy texture. Their homefries are perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The Deluxe Breakfast is very filling. For their Monte Cristo Sandwich, I found it to be a bit small in size, however it might be because I was comparing it to another Monte Cristo Sandwich I had in mind. Nevertheless, it was still delicious and it came with REAL maple syrup. I loved their Philly Cheesesteak, the seitan texture was just right and there was plenty of vegan cheesy goodness.

My favourite thing about D-Beatstro is their atmosphere and punk vibes. Their mismatched cutlery is charming and the service is very friendly. They have a small section in the restaurant where they sell merchandise from local artists which I think is super awesome to show their support for local goods."}
{"text":"Nice little place with vegan baked goods and floats. I would recommend coming here during the weekend however when they have a full menu. Seems to be more of an event space during the week."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place after my first visit, and this was my first experience at a fully vegan restaurant. I really enjoyed the food here! The tofu scramble is delicious, I recommend any dish with the scramble in it. The breakfast sausage was a little dry, but overall the food was hearty and great. The coffee and tea were also quite good.
The service was fantastic. The atmosphere was really homey and comfortable, it is a great place to hang out. I have endless respect for D-Beatstro's values and the way the company is run, and I highly recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"If you like the vegan, gluten free type of coffee and food then this is your place. If you are like me and like your coffee done the way you are used to then maybe try somewhere else. They do not have regular milk, only coconut, soy and almond milk are available. 

The thing that I did like about the place was that they had very interesting art work around the store for sale and they do offer their location for rental for events which is a large enough space. 

Overall, if you want to try somethings interesting or want to impress someone with how hip you are then check out D'beastro, but if you want a regular coffee, check out the Tim Hortons or Starbucks down the street."}
{"text":"The Deluxe Breakfast has the best potatoes!  I asked for jam for the toast and got cranberry sauce which was kinda strange but I ended up eating it with the vegan breakfast sausage that tasted like sage/thanksgiving dinner so that worked. The tofu scramble had so much turmeric it stained everything but I'm super full from so much of it. I would eat here again but will try something different next time. The percolatoled coffee was pretty good. And the local art and pop punk soundtrack adds to the casual vibe. Non-pretentious vegan place, I appreciate that but the food was just ok (except for the breakfast potatoes that rocked)."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and delicious food. Tried the \"BLT\" on a bagel and it was better than any BLT I've had made with actual bacon, no joke. Coffee was delicious with cashew milk as well. Gonna go this weekend to try their brunch as I've heard it's unreal. Would recommend to anyone looking to try something new, wether you're vegan or not. Good prices too."}
{"text":"Amazing place. First found them at Toronto Veg fest and have been making the trip to their location almost once  a week since. The vegan donuts are to die for and they make an incredible iced mocha with cashew milk. Really chill environment with great energy. Awesome place to study"}
{"text":"D-beatstro is a charming DIY and DIT (do it together) space that blossomed out of the ashes that was the old bike pirates space. Built by an army of people who all came together to create an inclusive event space and cafe with a strong youth/community building focus, they have matured into a pretty proper cafe with a very good selection of food and drinks. 

The space is unique and showcased a lot of art and other crafts and skills that members and regulars contribute. The sandwiches are tasty and simple, for a very reasonable price. The food is all vegan and made to order. Open for a year now this place has now started making take-home food like sausages and other items. 

Their space is a frequently used event space and show space and I could not recommend it enough of you are looking to set up a fundraiser, event or meet up. 

Nicely spaced tables--you won't feel like you are sitting on your neighbours lap. No trouble for anyone with strollers or who may need an accessible space. 

A+ we like them a lot and we hope they stick around for a long time."}
