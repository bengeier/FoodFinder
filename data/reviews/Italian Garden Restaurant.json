{"text":"We got take out from here while we were visiting family in town.

Everyone else got a veal sandwich while I had the lasagna. Husband says that his veal sandwich was tasty (bread, meat, sauce). He liked the hot peppers, but they could have been hotter he says. My lasagna was yummy. The noodles were very thin and there were a lot of layers. I could have used more cheese, but that's just me.

Our family in town are frequent customers, so much so that the owners have watched our niece grow!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Lady who served me was rude and incredibly ignorant. Food is over priced and moderate in taste. I've dined at this restaurant a few times and encountered the same poor service each time. i will never be returning and would strongly recommend an alternate Italian eatery for any one who wishes to eat Italian food."}
{"text":"You want it to be a secret find.

A bit cheezy, Italian flags everywhere, soccer on the television, chalkboard menu. You want it to be a family run joint with grandma in the back making incredible sauces and 16 year old cousin Antonio mopping out front being shouted at by his mama.

It might be family run, it might even be grandma's sauce, but alas, it isn't great. The pasta sits in the hotel pans too long and ends up mushy, not al dente, and the sandwiches are all a breaded-meat and tomato blur. The sauces lack any brightness of herbs or bold freshness of ingredients, or really much character to speak of.

The roasted green peppers are good. 

If you're stuck for lunchtime nosh, I'd walk down to the next strip mall's shawarma place, or take the 5 minute drive to Burrito Boyz. If you really need an Italian fix, this place won't kill you, and it's nice to be able to buy a cold Brio, but Canelli's down on Queen is a much better play.

I've had their tortellini once when it was fresh and it was fine, their prices are good, and I still have a soft spot for family run joints, so the place ekes out a second star. Barely.

Pro-tip: avoid the meatball sandwich in particular. The chicken is probably the best of your options there. And really, have a Brio."}
