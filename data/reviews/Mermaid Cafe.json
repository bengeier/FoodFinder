{"text":"Can't say enough good things about the mermaid. Food is always excellent; tasty and fresh. The bahn mi sandwich is amazing. The best sandwich I've ever had."}
{"text":"(3.5 stars) Fairly limited menu, but everything is unique and tasty. The Oh Mighty Isis and New Dehli Deli are my favorites; the coffee and bakery items are fine. There are few non-alcoholic beverage options apart from coffee, though. And I'm not sure why it always seems to take them at least 15 minutes to assemble a cold sandwich with chips, even when it's not at all busy."}
{"text":"The guy with the scrappy facial hair (the manager?) is rude and short with customers who aren't cool enough, and with employees--right in front of customers.  Coffee only okay.  Better places in walking distance."}
{"text":"Mermaid is a nice little cafe with delicious sandwiches and salads. I find it to be a good alternative to Lazy Jane's which can be crazy on the weekends. They're an even better alternative to Monty's which I think has gone downhill over the decades. They have a salad with beets and greens that is quite tasty...and I say that as someone who generally dislikes beets. They do a good job with their coffee drinks. I love their dedication to local farmers and food sources. I only wish I lived closer so I could visit more often."}
{"text":"I'm here probably 5+ times a week (and they're closed Mondays!). 

This is maybe the first place I saw in Madison that had cold brew instead of the usual iced coffee. Now it seems it's all that is served, but there was a time that wasn't the case! Mermaid's cold brew is really really good. Food is also really good, with the best sandwich I've had in Madison - the banh meatless (no mayo!) 

Wonderful owner and staff, overall a really friendly place that I'm happy to support!"}
{"text":"First of all - believe the hype about the Oh Mighty Isis sandwich -- it really is delicious! The curry aioli really makes the sandwich. The coffee is great too. Nice atmosphere. And there's a big colorful chalkboard you can draw on."}
{"text":"There is no pretense when it comes to the cafe/coffee house. It is what it is. A fun little hippy place with decent food and coffee. The service is friendly and slightly slow. The drinks are thoughtful and tasty. The iced tea selection rotates and is creative and adventurous. During the summer the specials board is filled with creative local veggie and fruit dishes. Try a summer dish with a herbal iced tea in their comfortable sidewalk seating. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is just fantastic.  The food is consistently delicious and the drinks consistently fantastic.  I love it here so much, I asked the owners to cater my birthday party.  They also have the best iced coffee in town.  I've never had anything here that wasn't amazing.

They have a bit of outdoor seating when it's nice out.  

Dinners sadly seem to be a thing of the past, except for the occasional bluegrass dinner night or equity dinner.  Call ahead if you're coming sometime not between 10AM and 2PM, as their hours change frequently."}
{"text":"Delicious. Had the breakfast sandwich and the yogurt parfait. Nice, small east side place."}
{"text":"Great coffee, super friendly service, and cute place. We really enjoyed our time here! Thanks!"}
{"text":"This is such a cozy little cafe! I've been here now a few times and the baristas are always very friendly and I love their wooden cash register! Good coffee and great atmosphere. I tried their Isis breakfast sandwich and it was spot on. This is definitely being added to my list of favorite madison cafes!"}
{"text":"I recently swung into the Mermaid Cafe for Saturday Brunch, and I could not have been happier. 

Atmosphere: Its a cozy coffee shop that feels a lot like Mother Fools or Electric Earth.  That means it is a great place to just be, but not a good place for groups.  There was limited outside seating on the sidewalk.

Food:  I can't speak to the omnivorous options, but the vegetarian options were delicious!  The vegetarian Bahn Mi and the egg sandwich were delicious and complex.  The unique play of flavors kept me coming back bite after bite just so that I could try and figure out what was going on in my mouth.  I will be the first to admit that Tofu can go really wrong really fast, but this was delicious.

Parking: Plenty of metered street parking in front.  I did not see a parking lot.

Service: Service is at the counter.  The service was cordial and helpful.  

Payment: Cash or check only.  I did not see an ATM.

Price:  Price was about $8 per sandwich, which is a bit pricy.  However, I felt that the food justified the price, and the price is on par with Marigolds and 4 and 20."}
{"text":"I love the O.M.I., the Mermade, and the Bahn Meatless. (Though this sandwich is a bittersweet reminder of what it's like living in larger city, with a Chinatown where there are lots of Vietnamese sandwich shops serving up giant bahn mi for $2.50. ::wipes a tear::)

There is always a seat and they welcome doggies in the sidewalk seating area. A bike rack would be awesome!"}
{"text":"Best coffee and egg sandwiches in Madison!  In fact, if I think about it, Mermaid might just be my favorite source of delicious, fresh sandwiches in Madison period.  I am something of a sandwich purist, happiest with something simple and fresh (and locally-sourced whenever possible, an area in which Mermaid goes above and beyond).  Unfortunately, there seems to be a trend in the cafe world of making sandwiches with too many disparate ingredients that rarely sound appetizing to me.  I can always count on Mermaid for their basics and great specials that often turn out to be exactly what I was craving."}
{"text":"Mermaid is part of what makes Schenks Corners such a unique community of retail, artists, restaurants and start-ups. Extremely consistent food with a focus on locally sourced ingredients. Coffee is solid and has pretty much been a daily ritual for me since they opened their doors."}
{"text":"Good food, great coffee. Makes me sad their cold brew is only seasonal, but this isn't unusual and makes sense. Also a very cool hangout spot in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've been to the Mermaid Cafe twice now for lunch - and oh boy, were they delicious! The first time, I ordered a cup of the carrot soup with a salad, and the second time, the Balinese rice bowl. The food is so delicious and fresh - and good for you! The menu is so different and varied. You are bound to find something that you'll like. I definitely will be returning for more lunch. The folks there are very friendly, service is good and the space very inviting."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Really nice ambiance. I got the burger for lunch and was disappointed with the burger itself. My fault though in part for ordering probably the most boring thing on the menu. My companion ordered their version of a roast beef sandwich and was really pleased. The side salad was great. Really interesting menu. Will definitely be back to try some of their more unique items. Street parking seems ample. Cash or check only."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop atmosphere, delicious food and well brewed coffee/espresso. Looking for a little more selection on the menu, but would not trade over the quality of what currently comes out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop - it's what I imagine Madison should be. Mermaid is small, relaxed and slightly hipster. It's a great place to grab a coffee and sandwich, and chill for an hour or two doing homework. The menu is more exciting than typical coffee shops (sandwiches & soups feature Indian, Vietnamese and Caribbean touches). 
I wish it was walking distance from campus, but then I fear it'd lose its charm and turn into an undergrad hangout. I'm happy to abide by its cash-only rules, since it adds good karma to the neighborhood. Yay, Mermaid!"}
{"text":"New lil' coffee shop/cafe on the near-east side.  Local and lovely.  Coffee and espresso roasted by Just Coffee - baked goods from Francois - homemade soups and sandwiches.  Almost no seating but I've taken \"to-go\" lunches from there on two occasions - very yummy soup & sandwich combos."}
{"text":"Love oh my isis! BEST vegetarian sandwich ever. The sauce, UNBELIEVABLE.

so, 4 stars for breakfast, but I would say maybe 3 for dinner. But I've only been once, so maybe there are better days. Was disappointed by the burger, and their meat plate wasn't impressive...

So, go for their brunch, which I think is only once a week, Sunday? Dinner... It's alright"}
{"text":"Delicious Bahn Mi sandwich. Great bread and Asian slaw. Carrot soup is excellent. Can't wait til dinner returns. Just one more reason that the Atwood neighborhood is a treasure."}
{"text":"Tasty and delicious.  Definitely worth a stop if you're in the neighborhood.  One of the best cups of coffee in Madison."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the Mermaid Cafe.  Their coconut curry aoli sauce totally rocks the Oh Mighty Isis and New Delhi Deli sandwiches and the soups I've tried (caribbean carrot and lentil) are delicious.  They have great coffee and baked goods as well if you're just looking for a sugar/caffeine boost.  
Also, the staff there are super nice and help contribute to the warm and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've driven/biked/walked past Mermaid 100 times before finally going in and I truly have been making poor life choices prior to that moment.  It was pretty busy on a Sunday morning but there was a table for two open for us. The black coffee was fantastic! We got breakfast sandwiches and really enjoyed them. It took a while to receive our food, but we weren't in a rush, so it was fine. Before we left, we decided we needed more of their coffee, so we got an iced coffee to go ($4, ouch). It was stellar. While at the register the second time, I saw they had $2 pour your own mimosas. A shame I missed that. 

All in all, a bit pricey, but it's local so I can deal. Everything we had tasted great and the employees were friendly."}
{"text":"First time there today and my only regret is not going sooner. Their bahn mi sandwich is not to be missed. The pickled carrots/radish were to die for! I thought the prices were pretty reasonable considering how big the sandwich was. It's hard to screw up tea but I thoroughly enjoyed that as well. 

The employees were super nice and the environment was great. It's such a cute place. I'll definitely be going back again soon. I'll dream about the sandwich in the meantime..."}
{"text":"The food was good and the decor/ ambiance was great but the service sucked big time. My friend and I came here after being down at the farmers market. We were both visiting madison from out of town and wanted to eat somewhere that used local ingredients. Yelp came to the rescue and we evaded over to the Mermaid Cafe . I order d the California BLT and my friend got the chicken pesto panini. We took our seats and waited.........and waited........and waited. 25 minutes later I went up to the counter to see what the deal was and they were JUST plating our food. WHAT?!?!?!?  We didn't order a steak , we order simple sandwiches that take 7 minutes to make. I told the gal at the counter that we had been waiting for 25 minutes for sandwiches which was ridiculous. There was no offer of a free drink or free dessert nothing. Would love to go back and the food was great but the service was def sub par"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past year.  The interior is also very kid friendly. I've had their coffee (decent!), and their OMI breakfast sandwich (eggs, coconut curry, avocado and other stuff on a pinini). 

Their orange juice looked good.

It's pretty hippie and reminds me of some places in Berkeley I used to eat at.  Service is very friendly.  Why not go here and combine it with a 16 mile bike loop around Lake Monona, since it's off the bike trails. A winning date combo if I don't say so myself."}
{"text":"The coffee here is a 5! Best I had in Madison! Way better than that French named place that starts with a 'B'. The food selection wasn't that large, not sure if they have a kitchen or not. Should be called Mermaid Coffee, not Cafe. They should put the focus on what they are really really good at!"}
{"text":"A few months ago, Mermaid Cafe briefly closed its doors to renovate. Upon it's re-opening, voila! It is a coffee and sandwich shop by day, full-service restaurant by night. I must say, I am quite pleased with the change.

Mermaid's daytime menu continues to offer some of the most tasty sandwiches, soups, muffins, and pastries in town (try the pumpkin pepita muffin--mmmm...). At night, they now offer a small seasonal menu based on the freshest findings from the local farmer's market. A different gourmet pizza every Thursday, specialty burgers all week long, and a regular menu that, this fall, includes a pork rib in sage and apple cider glaze (the sides of brussels sprouts and butternut squash with gruyere were particularly dreamy), and a delicate yet hearty spinach salad with goat cheese, bacon or walnuts, and soft boiled egg.

When I went there, the service was friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. I especially liked the little basket of seasoned popcorn that arrives on each table to begin the meal. With continued lunch and new dinner offerings, I'm glad that I now have *twice* the reasons to visit one of the sweetest little places in Madison."}
{"text":"We walked in with an appetite, which probably not the best idea... we left hungry. My partner and I live in the area, and are new. We tried the Isis sandwich, we are both active people, maybe most people don't mind a half sandwich. but for $6.25, I expect at least a side?! We had the breakfast sandwiches and two coffees (very pleased they serve JUST coffee, local = good), $21.50 was the total Pretty steep. Service was okay. I might come back, I just don't know..."}
{"text":"Typical Madison cafe. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. Also, it is a great alternative to the long weekend lines at nearby Lazy Jane's (and, to a lesser extent, Monty's). Some of the best iced tea I have ever had the pleasure to consume. 
The only complaint I have is the value to portion ratio on their sandwiches. Good stuff, but I couldn't help but wish there was at least 50% more for the price I paid for a breakfast sandwich. 
I also have to agree with Susanne G. as it pertains to laptop users \"camping out\" at tables. It is a frustrating phenomenon, but is commonplace in coffee shops and cafes these days."}
{"text":"Mermaid has a lot of things going for it. Both the interior & exterior are super cute & cozy, there's ample seating and wifi, a truly unprecedented menu for a coffee shop--bahn mi and indonesian rice bowls?!? yaaaaas!--, locally sourced ingredients, and great cold brew. But it's really lacking in the service department. 

In all the times I've been to Mermaid, I've never gotten so much as a \"Hello\" from the barista. I walk in, they stare at me until I approach the counter and place my order, they tell me the price--that's the only time they say anything--then make my drink and place it wordlessly on the counter. On a good day I'm asked if I would like room for cream.

I work in the customer service industry too. I know full well how hard it can be to muster up a smile in the face of crazy customers and a low hourly wage. But not getting a \"hi\" or \"what can I get for you?\" or a \"thanks\" is just bad vibes and leaves me feeling kinda bummed. Good thing their coffee usually picks me right back up!"}
{"text":"Great coffee shop that has recently expanded to dinner service on select days.  While  I haven't had dinner here, I can tell you that their breakfast sandwiches and pastry are excellent.  Try their O.M.I--an egg sandwich with a curry sauce."}
{"text":"Awesome chai and the Isis is the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had.  Only downside is I waited a year after moving to Madison to stop here."}
{"text":"All the charm. I've been meaning to go to the mermaid Café for about four years and I finally made it. The environment surpassed my expectations with homey decor and relaxed, happy faces on both sides of the counter. I saw quiche on the menu and listed at $9.50 I was really hesitant to order but went ahead and got a slice anyway - thank God I did because the portion was large and the flavor was flawless. So. Lemony. (In all of the right ways!!). Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Their New Delhi Deli sandwich was amazing. Truly tasted like it was made with fresh ingredients and love. If panera bread was plankton's scum bucket burger, the mermaid cafe would be sponge bob's crabby patty!"}
{"text":"I've been driving by the Mermaid Cafe for years, always meaning to stop in. Well today I was coaxed over to the near east side of Madison for a little Sunday Brunch and political banter. Plus, I had a hankering for Pancakes and I figured if Mermaid was worth it's salt, they would have Pancakes. 

Pancakes they had... Fantastic pancakes, served with nice blackberry compote, butter, whipped cream, and warm syrup. 

I also had the ISIS breakfast sandwich - scrabbled eggs, cheddar, avocado, and sort of magical coconut curry sauce. 

Add in the very serviceable latte and I was very satisfied.  I'll be back. You should try out this little locals' oasis. It's tucked Into the Schenk's Corners Neighborhood. The food is high quality - it's a very relaxed atmosphere where you order at the counter and the food makes it's way to your table."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's cute and the food is awesome. Try the banh mi (with or without meat) or really any other sandwich or salad. I'm addicted to their iced teas and love the tree hugger iced coffee. It's a great place to go for lunch, brunch or just to sit with a cup of coffee and your lap top. Always a great neighborhood crowd and friendly service."}
{"text":"We went there on a Sunday and they had very little to choose from, just listings on a chalkboard. Not the usual menu. The food was okay, but certainly not better than average. The wait staff was on the surly side."}
{"text":"Went in for Sunday brunch.  They stated that, because it was Sunday, they were only serving one of 8-10 food options.  I ordered the Oh Mighty Isis Sandwich and my husband ordered the omelet.  We split both, which was good because the Sandwich was really small.  My husband's omelet also looked like they only used one egg and the vegetables inside didnt taste cooked, but at least it had a bit of lettuce and potatoes on the side.  The lemonade we had was pretty good; however, we left hungry."}
{"text":"I brunched the brunch out of brunch this morning with the Japanese Farmhouse Breakfast (sub tofu for egg) and I deem it...

TOTALLY nom-worthy.

The Mermaid menu is small but mighty and the quaint Atwood spot makes for a perfect mid-morning hangout. The coffee is good, they source largely locally, and the prices are reasonable. Next time I'll be in for lunch to try the Bahn Meat-less (not available fo' brunch!)."}
{"text":"What you expect from Madison. Progressively liberal food served in a progressively liberal way."}
{"text":"How cute is this place!

I stopped by for a light breakfast after a farmer's market stroll. 
The chic interior was something I didn't imagine from the storefront. There is a wall of blackboard with chalks provided for you to stretch your imagination while sipping a cup of morning joe. That's an intelligent decor. 

My Matty's bk sandwich with pesto, egg, and tomato was alright. On the other hand, my fiance's Isis sandwich was super good. The curry aioli sauce + avocado proved to be the golden combination. We also took out their pumpkin muffin to go. I think it was either vegan or vegetarian. The muffin had lots of shredded carrots and pumpkin seeds - it was the most delicious fibrous muffin ever!"}
{"text":"Such a relief to slip into this creative, accepting water wonderland of caffeine and other treats. I loved the option to pre-pay for coffee refills, AND I was given a whipped cream sample! This is livin!"}
{"text":"It's a really cute little place & they have good food. Good vegetarian options too. I'll definitely go back at some point."}
{"text":"this a pleasant, lovely neighbourhood cafe.

their corn chowder was mighty fresh and full of flavor.
their bahn mi was so-so. (if you've had one from a chinatown, you will be slightly crestfallen.)

BUT.

their mochas? 

SHUT THE FRONT DOOR.
AND SIGN ME UP."}
{"text":"The OMI, a cup of the carrot soup, a double shot espresso, and an almost magical energy as soon as you park in front of this cafe. I love the strings of lights hanging out front, and I'd like to hook up an IV of that curry aioli right into my vein.

This place is still warm and fuzzy, and I love it forever."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch on a Sunday and was pleased to see the Japanese bowl on the menu. It is basically miso soup with brown rice, mushrooms, a poached egg, and seaweed. I thought it was pretty good, but then I realized it was a $7 bowl of soup. It was an interesting brunch item and I would like to see more similar items. I would come back here because the environment was nice, but the prices are a little high for what you get."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, they know their coffee drinks and the food is delicious. Locally sourced food"}
{"text":"Why did I wait so long to visit Mermaid Cafe? I was wowed by their breakfast food and drinks on my first visit.

The Mermaid Cafe is a quaint independent cafe in the Atwood neighborhood that has a small menu of breakfast and lunch food. The cafe space is a bit cozy, but they have some outdoor tables too. I got my stuff to go, so I feel like I missed out on some of the cafe experience (just another excuse to come back!).

For breakfast, I got the oh my isis sandwich and it was SO, SO GOOD. The sauce! The other reviews weren't kidding. They had some other healthier options that looked interesting too (some sort of grain bowl? I don't remember).

I got a coffee drink with cream, local honey, and cinnamon. It was AMAZING! They had the local honey for sale in little jars too. I had planned on getting a regular coffee, but their menu of specials enticed me; there were a few that I wanted to try.

They also have a daily quiche and lots of stuff on chalkboards. Maybe I'm jumping to conclusions, but that tells me that they make a lot from scratch and change up the menu on a regular basis.

I love it! I'll be back again soon. And maybe for the big brunch they do on Sundays."}
{"text":"I LOVED my experience here! I had a wonderful light breakfast. A cup of espresso and the best parfait I have ever had. The fruit was fresh and in season, the yogurt was perfect, and the granola was out of this world. I was actually in a better mood for the rest of the day! 

I look forward to frequenting and recommending the Mermaid Cafe!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. The Tree Hugger iced coffee is a must try. Local produce, I'm happy."}
