{"text":"Friendly, Napoli is owned/operated by Italians! Excellent pizza and generous pasta, also serve good subs with fresh ingredients. Never had a bad meal. I recommend there Eggplant Parmesan. Only downside its only Take out or delivery"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in Charlotte. It is family owned. Excellent costumer service. They deliver within my area. The pizza is delicious and it is priced well. I highly recommend giving Napoli's a chance!"}
{"text":"Ok kids, how could we let this happen? Best pizza this side of Luigi's, cheap and with delivery to boot, and it's closed. Shame."}
