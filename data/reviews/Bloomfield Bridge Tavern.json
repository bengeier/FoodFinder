{"text":"the BBT is awesome because:
- outdoor tables/jersey barrier where you can sit and people-watch on Liberty Ave
- the pierogies rock
- $1 beer night on Thursdays (so what if it might be expired?)
- i met my husband there
- people hang their single-speeds on the chain link fence"}
{"text":"The food here is great, the owner is friendly, and the beer is cheap ($1.10 bottle Thursdays).

These are the best pierogies that I have found in Pittsburgh.  The Red or White plates come with other Polish sides, come with plenty of food, and are well priced.

I've been back, and plan on going as much as I can while I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great experience! The food was delicious, staff was welcoming and we played darts waiting for our food. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Why I love BBT
1. Drum & Bass Hub... they had LTJ Bukem come. I'm sold.
2. Dollar beer specials... (with some beers that go for $6 at sharp edge)
3. Monday night quarter wings... jumbo wings. yum yumz!
4. Polish food...the red plate! SO GOOD! (Pierogi, Kielbasa, Golabki, Haluski, and Kluski)

This is the humblest of bars that peeks out at the the end of bloomfield bridge with little drawing your attention to it. The guys and gal who work the bar are soo so friendly and you've got your weird motley crowd that comes here that consist of many yinzers sprinkled with a few students now and again like myself. Food's great. Beer's great. People are swell!

p.s. they have east end brewery on tap!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Pittsburgh for school and I wanted to enjoy a night after an exam with my classmates. Unfortunately the service here was very terrible and ruined our night. I was tolerant until the waitress came to me while I was playing ping pong and questioned the amount I tipped her. She had a very negative attitude about it and that is NOT how you talk to a customer even if you feel like the tip was unsatisfactory. The tip I gave her is standard where I come from for a student without income. So it was a learning experience for me to learn what's standard in Pittsburgh. However, that doesn't mean she needs to talk to any customer the way she talked to me today."}
{"text":"A Bloomfield staple for as long as I've lived here --- great as a bar, restaurant, and live music venue! Sheila and Nikki are awesome bartenders, and Steve and Carl are so sweet and dedicated to this place. They also treat local bands right --- never charging bands to play there and allowing them to play whatever freaky kind of stuff they're into! Never had a bad experience here (except from some Strangeways bros) and I always find it hilarious when someone says the service was rude. They're only rude to you if you're rude to them :)"}
{"text":"This is a friggin' great bar.  I used to live down the street, moved to NYC, and whenever I'm back in Pittsburgh I go here twice or more.  Best pierogis in Pittsburgh, way better than anything in NYC.  LOVE dollar beer night.  Owner is friendly, bouncer is lovely, bartender is badass.  Great porch.  Wish we had bars like this in New York."}
{"text":"As advertised, cheap dive bar, great Polish food, well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Stopped by just after opening on a Wednesday evening (5 pm). Spent a while talking to the very friendly 2nd generations owner Steve and enjoyed a couple of beers and the excellent pierogis.  Friendly, dive-y place with good food and inexpensive beer.  I would go again."}
{"text":"Fuzz (Drum and Bass night) on Wednesdays is LEGENDARY. This place is an absolute Pittsburgh classic and should not be missed. The biggest drum and bass DJs in the world play this tiny little bar because of it's history. We should be very proud of the BBT and the whole Fuzz crew for putting Pittsburgh on the map. 

As for the bar, it's your typical Bloomfield dive. If you are into that, you're going to love it...if you're a pansy and you need a martini glass + quieter music, you can walk your ass down the street to somewhere else. ;-)"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Just tried it out for the first time last night.  I moved to put a few months back and no nothing of the town, travel weekly for business so I have tried my share of local taverns and this place is welcoming, fun and cozy.  The staff behind the bar consists of the owner, family and friends which makes for a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Where I go when I need Polish food, stat. Service is gruff and sometimes lacking (there have been times when our evening starts off with table service and then halfway through the meal our waiter disappears and we're the crazy ones who didn't realize it's now bar service only), but just give me a plate of pierogies and some beer and I'm a happy girl."}
{"text":"If you live in Pittsburgh, then this is a must visit site! 

If you like Polish food, then this is a must visit site. 

 If you are just visiting Pittsburgh, then this is a must visit site.

The Polish food is fantastic!  The Owner is is the most hospitable guy out there.  

Come in, order a meal and enjoy true ethnic Pittsburgh hospitality!

You will be made to feel at home and welcomed.  I had met a guy while traveling on an airplane who sang the praises of the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern.  He peaked my interest and one visit and I was sold.  

This is a wonderful restaurant with more character then you could imagine."}
{"text":"My husband and I just came back from our first visit to the BBT. We will definitely be back. We went because we were enticed to try the half price pierogies, and they did not disappoint! Oh so soft pillows of goodness! We also tried the buffalo wings and the fresh cut fries. OMG! This was comfort bar food at its best. Our server was very friendly and helpful and made our visit very comfortable. Do yourself a favor and stop in at the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern...you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"My experience at BBT was horrible. The man at the door carded both my grand daughter and me. I am over 65. He would not let us enter until I showed ID. Very dark and dingy bar area. Locals at bar were starring at us. We decided to eat on patio that was screened in.  Waitress slapped down menus. Not pleasant. We ordered.  I wanted to substitute potato pancakes for the fries that came with my meal. Was told NO  SUBSTITUTES.   Took way too long for food. Grand daughter asked for refill on her soft drink and was charged for a second drink. Not a good experience.  Will NOT be going back."}
{"text":"I had a few drinks here with friends. Afterwards I asked for a cup of water since I was driving home. The manager told me that he could not spare some tap water and that I had to buy a bottle of water. Any place that does not condone sobriety is a poor environment."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's a little odd, but the food is as good as you can get anywhere, and the people are friendly.  I visit every single time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I've been here on loud nights to see shows. I've been here on quiet nights to eat solo. Overall, I really like the BBT. The Polish food is the best I can find in the neighborhood and that's mainly what keeps me coming back.

Pro-Tip: Unless you're a college kid, don't be fooled by the $1 beer specials. The beer is \"slightly\" skunked."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years. Sheila was the first person in the city to book my band, which was struggling to get shows when my brother and I first moved to Bloomfield! The BBT holds a special place in my heart. Many amazing memories here. The food is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G and the atmosphere is extremely homey. $1 bottle night is obviously the best time one can have. A must visit if you are in the neighborhood, and on weekends there are live bands!"}
{"text":"I have lived by the BBT for almost a year now, but haven't found the time to go until yesterday. The staff were incredibly friendly and committed to guests having a great experience.  The kielbasa was great and they had the best hand made perogies I've ever had. Add on imported Polish beer and it made for a great night. Will definitely be going  back."}
{"text":"I'd really like to give this higher ratings, due the the $1.10 beers, decent bar food and friendly owner, but my last experience left a sour taste in my mouth.

A group of friends and I were there on a Thursday in March, having a few beers and eating some Polish food at the bar. Now, if you haven't been here before they have 2 TVs behind the bar, about 15 feet apart from each other.

It was like any other Thursday in March - cold and rainy, half empty bar - except it was the beginning of the NCAA basketball tournament. My friends and I were hoping to catch some of the games and we knew BBT would be a little iffy because the Penguins were playing (normal, regular season game), but we figured we'd ask the bartender if we could get a basketball game on one of the TVs. It couldn't hurt to ask, right? Wrong.

The conversation, with the female bartender, went a little like this:

Friend: \"Excuse me, would it be possible to put the tournament on?\"
Bartender: \"Don't you know the Pens are playing? Aren't you a Pens fan?\"
Friend: *looking down at his Phillies shirt* \"No, I'm not from Pittsburgh.\"
Bartender: \"We can't change the channel. We have paying customers who will leave if we change the channel.\"

Fair enough, we knew it might not happen. We even excused the bartender's terrible logic (inferring that we weren't paying customers; we certainly paid for our drinks and meals). And that was fine with us. We were perfectly content to continue hanging out and have a few more drinks before moving on.

However, that was not possible as the bartender refused to serve us for the rest of our time there. No, it wasn't an honest mistake; she knew we had empty beers and were trying to order more, but every time she came close to us she dipped her head or averted her eyes. It was quite obvious. 

Eventually she had to come in front of where I was seated to make a drink for another customer, and that was when I was finally able to make eye contact to ask for another drink. She said OK and walked away, never to return.

And that's when I decided never to return.

No Ms. Bartender, what makes paying customers leave, contrary to your popular belief, is not changing a channel or the lack-thereof.  It's disrespecting them."}
{"text":"I saw the BBT featured on the Food Network years ago and I've been wanting to try it ever since. Since I live in Louisiana, that wasn't something that could be easily accomplished, but I finally got my chance. I ordered one of their popular Polish platters (white) along with some golabki (cabbage rolls), which are one of my favorite foods. Unfortunately, the platter was pretty bland and the haluski were merely OK. It was somewhat of a disappointment, but I'm glad that I finally tried it."}
{"text":"When in the land of pierogis, you should eat Polish food! Yelp led is to this restaurant during a recent visit to PGH, and we LOVED it! Pierogis, tolabki, haluski & kluski! YUM! And local Pittsburgh beers! Casual atmosphere, casual service. Price is fantastic! Will be back over future visits to the 'burgh!"}
{"text":"I just left here and have to say if I could give zero stars I would.  The people were nice but the food was awful.  I came based on the good reviews of Polish food.  I am Polish and was craving some delicious pierogies.  This place came up short on every level.  I got the red plate.  Golabki= bland and seasoning inside was not mixed well and there was a large section of just herbs or something.  I didnt want to dig further to find out because I was afraid it was something I wouldn't want to know.  Haluski and Kluski were bland beyond belief.  No cabbage or a hint of the taste of cabbage.  The noodles had an odd taste too.  The kielbasa was burnt.  The entire outer casing was black and the taste off it was Hillshire farms.  
The only saving grace to a small degree was the pierogi.  I had a potato and cheese and ordered the sauerkraut ones too.  The one that came with the platter had no butter or onions on it so it was dry but the pierogi was decent.  The sauerkraut ones came with burnt onions and butter...but more like a puddle of grease.  
I have had way better Polish food in this city.  I have no idea how this could be considered an \"award winning\" place for Polish food.  I hope it just sits well tonight and i dont regret this later.  No wonder it is closing."}
{"text":"Cool little dive bar with some of the Best Polish food I've ever had, definitely the best I've had in Pittsburgh. The red Polish platter is the way to go.  The pierogis are perfectly done, you'll want to order a few extra of those most certainly.  They also have a nice little selection of Polish beers and sometimes have live music.  The owner was very friendly and the service was good. Will most certainly return."}
{"text":"I would just rate this place as ok- it's serviceable for a pretty good night. I've been here a couple of times for drinks and also a couple of times to see a local band that I like play. There was nothing particularly good or bad about this place, except my group and I did get kicked out of it once. I organized a 9 hole golf pub crawl where we traveled down Liberty to 9 different bars for a drink at each place. We stopped inside BBT, and the bartender refused to support a night where we were stopping by that many places- so he refused to serve us and asked us to leave. No problem, they just lost a ton of service and my business!"}
{"text":"Ths place has ridiculous drink specials and their drum and bass wednesday is pretty awesome.  A selection of bottled beers are offered at a little more than a dollar each while the dj is on on wednesdays.  There is a very small cover charge for the dj at the door.  

I got their polish platter for around ten bucks that has a little of pretty much everything they offer, the noodles were soggy and not very appetizing but my famished friend devoured them anyway.  They have specials on stuffed cabbage and perogies normally.  
I got the red polish platter which had pierogi, kielbasa, golabki, haluski and kluski.  

Its a pretty great place to just come and chill, listen to interesting music and eat some polish food."}
{"text":"This is a dive bar...and I mean that in a good way. Dive doesn't mean dirty it means relaxed. And what a great place to relax and have absolutely Pgh's best polish food! Bartender/owner Steve makes sure everyone feels welcome and serves amazing homemade Polish favorites that is one of my favorite places to have fun and eat some simply awesome dishes."}
{"text":"This place is the tops. I heartily agree, if you are visiting Steel Town (as we were), and especially if you live somewhere lacking in old world ethnic influence (as we do), just get here.  You will love it. Such a warm and welcoming atmosphere! We felt like it was our place within moments of arrival. I never did catch the owner's name but he was such a great character, a totally perfect barkeep for a totally Polish neighborhood joint with totally excellent comfort food!

It's a small place but you can feel free to drag the available tables and chairs to suit your group. We ate at the bar which was just fine. This is a small place, and it's a one man kitchen so don't be looking for fast food here! Ours came out pretty quick anyway. The Polish platter (red) was the obvious choice and I ate every bite. Oh heavenly pierogi, delectable and hearty stuffed cabbage roll, warm and wonderful noodles, and.... the kielbasa.  The five-star kielbasa.

I have to mention that my husband, who is 100% Polish and has many, many decades of experience to draw upon, stated for the record that BBT's kielbasa was the BEST kielbasa he had EVER eaten. And that's saying a lot.

They've a nice smoking deck, toasty warm and comfy.  Kickin' Polish beers available, as well as wondrous blackberry brandy designed for sipping, not slamming.  By the benevolent hand of fate I was the 1,000,000th customer and our host provided a round of that cheering spirit in celebration. 

I hated to leave. But vow to return."}
{"text":"The cabbage rolls sucked !!  & , they ran OUT of Miller light ..ARE you kidding me ? But the band was great !!"}
{"text":"This is the best Polish food you will find in the city of Pittsburgh... a city with a lot of Polish people. I'm not an expert on the rest of the world, but it may be the best outside of Poland. And my mom grew up a Grabowski. 

BBT is a GREAT little bar at the beginning of Bloomfield (Pittsburgh's Little Italy) featuring Cheap drinks, amazing Polish food and live entertainment (usually bands). Steve owns the place, his son works with him on breaks from school and his brother (Carl) will most likely be sitting at the door taking IDs. The food is reasonably priced and while it could be classified as \"bar food\" it is soooo much more. Pierogi come with butter and sour cream, the polish sausage is unREAL and even the fries are good. 

This food tastes like someone wrapped happiness in comfort and fried it up in joy. 

Tuesday nights is the Acoustic Open Stage- always a good time. Thursdays have select beers priced at $1.10- that's right ONE DOLLAR, TEN CENTS. It's awesome. Weekends (and often weekdays as well) have live bands playing on the stage. 

My friends and I used to go there more regularly, but it still wasn't a lot. Even still, Steve got to know us, and always took great care of us. This place is a gem!

NOTE: Don't try to get in without an ID. You have to be over 21, and they have a strict over-21 policy due to some people taking advantage of them years back."}
{"text":"I've been here many times. Here are my overall pros and cons:

(+)
. Good pierogies
. Cooler of $1 beers every Thursday
. At least one of the bartenders is very friendly and provides really good service
. Outdoor seating can be fun in the summer

(-)
. Above mentioned dollar beers are typically expired... most of the time this is ok, but I've gotten a few very disgusting drinks there before.
. The more micro-type drafts are a little pricey and have been flat on a couple of occasions
. I've only had good luck with one of the bartenders/servers. The men who I think are the owners are either clueless or rude whenever I go in there. I've been carded maybe 3 times before on the same night BY THE SAME PERSON!
. Although the inside is a lot nicer since the renovation, I'm still not really so into the vibe."}
{"text":"Ok so I'm Polish and cook polish food,this place will take you back. I will be coming back few more time over my stay here! Highly recommended!!!bardzo dobrze!"}
{"text":"This is a dive bar located on a busy intersection.  The interior is dark, the environment is sorta grungy.  But for what it is, it's superb.  It's not pretending to be something fancy.  BBT is true to it's core; Yinzer if you will.

The bar food makes this place special: authentic Polish food at rock bottom prices.  The perogies were simply outstanding.  The Kalsuki was plentiful, but honestly, kind of bland.  I needed hot sauce to eat it.  Then again, that's probably the Brown in me speaking.

Come here for a casual, relaxed vibe.  Enjoy the perogies; enjoy the view of Bloomfield.  Certainly a nice spot for people watching."}
{"text":"The beers that they have on special are stored on in a separate cooler. I have never found anything I have actually enjoyed to drink on special here.  The staff is personalbe and a lot of my friends enjoy frequently this bar. In my circle it's referred to as BBT. 
I have had some good times, I just wish the beer that was on special was a little tastier."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks and food last night around 8pm with 2 friends. We started a tab at the bar and moved to a table on the patio after informing the bartender that we would be doing this. No one checked on us throughout the night and we had to continue to go to the bar to ask for refills on our drinks and for a menu. No one came to see what we wanted to order, so for refills on our drinks and to order we again had to return to the bar. Meanwhile all tables around us continued to be served as one would expect. 

We should have seen the writing on the wall and not even ordered food, but eventually it came to the table. A few minutes later, the bartender returned with our closed tabs and took our UNFINISHED food from the table. We were \"served\" by a young man (Steve according to the receipt) and a middle-aged woman (Sheila?) throughout the night. 

We don't understand why we were treated so poorly, so I wrote a note to the BBT via their website expecting an apology. In Sheila's email response no apology was given! Instead I was told that we had \"misunderstood\" the policy to serve guests whose tabs originated at the bar -- a policy which did not seem to be posted or explained to any other guests. Definitely a PASS unless you're happy to be treated as a burden and ignored by staff."}
{"text":"I'm convinced I was an old, polish woman in my previous life. I LOVE haluski, pierogis and all forms of carbs paired with cabbage and butter. We heard through the yinz-vine that this place was a must try. Prepare to be carded upon entry if going in the afternoon.         
     Right when we walked in the man behind the bar, who I assume was the owner, welcomed us and said that we had come to the place where we would get the 2nd best polish food in the city. We asked where the number one spot was, and he replied \"The kitchen of a polish friend or family member.\" The inside is small with a bar, a heated smoking deck and a little dining area. The menu has your typical bar food selections and then ....the polish food. There are platter or a la carte options. We started with an order of potato pancakes. My husband ordered the Red Platter(stuffed cabbage, kaluski, grilled kielbasa, haluski and one pierogi) and I decided on an order of potatoe and onion pierogies (minimum 3, 1.25 each) and haluski. The platters can be customized. 
The kielbasa, pierogies and stuffed cabbage are lights out! The kaluski and haluski left a little to be desired. Not bad, but nothing spectacular. My only complaints : soda (Coca cola) was flat, dining room was cold, wish the haluski had a little more flavor. The selling points : friendly service and delicious pierogis. I'd absolutely go again."}
{"text":"Really excellent Polish food.   Everything is homemade and delicious.  The portions are generous.  There is a weekday special, 1/2 off Pierogies from 5pm-7pm.  The decor is nothing fancy, but this place is certainly unique.  There are bands that perform later on weekends and an open mic night on Tuesday, check the schedule. The outdoor seating is nice."}
{"text":"SUper awesome dive bar in Bloomfield. Owner is cool, specials are unique, and food is so fitting for Bloomfield --old school and delicious. Definitely recommend as a late night bite. I think on Thursdays they have some like mystery beer special."}
{"text":"Bloomfield Bridge has excellent Polish food. Everything Polish there is amazing. The Polish Platters are typically what I get. I like variety.

The beer selection is good. I highly recommend Thursday nights if you want to experiment since they have a nice bottle selection.

I typically go for dinner.

As a warning, the place is very dive bar looking. You would just assume they only have a deep fry in the back and questionable bar staples.  Best Polish good in the city."}
{"text":"Bloomfield Bridge Tavern is a dive bar with some the best pierogies I've ever had. We had a friend's band playing there and figured we would go early to eat some pierogies,  since everyone was raving about them. 
Upon entering the smell of butter and onion was so good, I headed straight for the nearest worker to see, how can I go about getting the deliciousness in my body. There is a minimum order of three so I got three and so did my boyfriend.  They were delicious!  My favorite were the potato, my boyfriend's was the sauerkraut.  
The place could definitely use some updates. They have a mirror ceiling, black tape on the bar, basic cheap and dirty bar stools. I didn't use the bathroom but when I asked if it was clean, someone said, well not really. 

Thankfully this bar is non smoking, but our clothes and hair smelled like onions so bad when we got home we immediately had take a shower."}
{"text":"Still love the food here, but gotta admit the service is often subpar. I took a few out-of-town friends for the Pittsburgh pierogi experience and ordered a white Polish platter to share. Told the waiter that we were interested in one of each of the three pierogi they offer with the platter (potato and cheese, sauerkraut, and cottage cheese), since three come with the meal.

Instead she brought out the platter and three additional pierogi, and rudely explained that only potato and cheese pierogi come with the platter, even though I've ordered the platter with different pierogi before. I took the extra pierogi that came from the kitchen and understood the misunderstanding before she got sassy, so the rudeness wasn't really necessary.

A simple clarification or an apology would've been nice. I probably won't come back because she embarrassed me in front of several people I rarely see when it wasn't even necessary.

A lot of restaurants in Pittsburgh offer pierogi anyway.

PS Never in my life did I think I'd say pierogi so much in a few short paragraphs. Lol."}
{"text":"This place is a Pittsburgh institution and as such, no real trip to the 'Burgh is complete without a visit. Great for a quick beer, great traditional food, or to see a local band play. Yes you could categorize it as a dive bar, but the place's beer selection and quality of food put it in its own class. Every time I return to my hometown I try to swing by."}
{"text":"My wife and I came to this place when we first moved to Pittsburgh. It is kind of dark, and kind of dingy, but the owner was hilarious and friendly and served us personally. It was in the late afternoon, right after opening, so it was pretty laid back. The food was super good and cheap, and one of the few authentic Polish places we have found, and they had some good alcohol to serve as well. We weren't really there for the bar crowd, but if you want a good early dinner this is a nice, fun place."}
{"text":"One's Polish heart swells with pride at the sight of the huge Polish flag on the outside of the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern. And I'm proud to say that this restaurant is home to the best pierogies I've eaten so far. 

Perhaps it was the accompanying Tyskies (Polish beer. It's a Polish bar... come on!) I had that night causes my praise to be superfluous. But they were damn good!

I split the famed Polish platter with my sister not knowing at the time that according to the lore of the bar such a thing is a sign of marriage. Thank God this place isn't located in West Virginia! The platter consists of the aforementioned stellar pierogies, haluski (stewed cabbage and noodles), kluski (noodles and cottage cheese), golabki (stuffed cabbage) and kielbasa (Polish sausage better than anything those Germans came up with - but I'm probably biased) all adorned with a little Polish flag.

All were delicious - the golabki, surprisingly so - except for the haluski. I still can't get over the stewed cabbage. 

While the kitchen took its time filling our order, the barkeep was extremely friendly and determined to make sure we enjoyed ourselves. The interior is sparse and not as cool as the - and maybe I'm a nerd for saying this - crests of the cities and towns of Poland painted on a low wall in the parking lot. 

Overall, I will be making return trips each time I am in Pittsburgh. Bottom line: AMAZING pierogies."}
{"text":"Food = + 3.5 stars
Value = + 0.5 stars
Rude Bartender/Server = - 3.5 stars

= rounded up to 1 star because I have to

Enjoyed the authenticity of this place up until the end of the meal, in spite of a double-duty server/bartender who was a bit \"short\" throughout the order-taking and meal-serving process (also worth noting:  it was NOT busy at all.)  Everything went downhill, though, when it came time for me to check out and I asked her to split the payment onto two different cards because I was paying with a corporate card.  She informed me of a credit card minimum, which would have put me under their limit on one of the cards.  She flew off the handle when I asked if this policy was posted anywhere (it was not) and took my payments (angrily snatching the cards out of my hands and literally throwing the receipts and pen onto the bar too) while proceeding to mouth off about how \"ridiculous\" I was being to everyone in the restaurant.  (And by everyone, I mean all two people.)  Got out of there as quickly as I could, thankful that I did not get beat up by the two guys at the bar that she tried to turn against me.  They didn't seem too fazed, though, so I'm guessing this must be a regular occurrence for her.

The food was better than decent (3.5 stars) but I have to believe that there is somewhere else in Pittsburgh I can get it served without the side of b*tch.

UPDATE:

This afternoon, 11 days after publishing the original review, I was contacted via Yelp's message feature by 4 different \"Yelpers\" attempting to, I guess, defend this establishment. While some of their comments were borderline threatening and/or harassing, I am most concerned with the integrity of this site as they are mostly unused/inactive accounts that have been asked by the employee whom I had the misfortune to encounter at this restaurant to post positive reviews for the specific reason of counteracting mine.

Some of these reviewers also contacted me by private message.  In their messages, they not only claimed to know certain details of my visit and accused me of earning the rude behavior I received (by allegedly doing such horrible things as not putting my phone down immediately when the server came to the table to take my order) but also have used threatening and harassing language.

Their messages also led me to a post on this employee social media account where she shared my original review on and encouraged additional harassment.  (Pictures of me and personal information from my social media account were posted on her page as well, although these were eventually taken down.)

So if you are thinking about checking out Bloomfield Bridge Tavern for the first time, do your homework. Check other review and social media sites. They consistently have a 4-star averages, but there are several horror stories out there -- and all with a very consistent theme: that they are \"rude\", \"unprofessional\", \"awful\", \"miserable\" people (actual quotes from other reviews.) Even one of the *positive* reviews on here states that they \"don't put up with any sh*t\". Isn't that kindof a red flag? Anyway, it's really a shame to see a local neighborhood business with decent food operated in this way.

Buyer beware."}
{"text":"What can I say, I *knew* this place was a dive bar before I decided to eat there so I don't know why I was so annoyed the duration of my stay.

I got carded at the door.  I'm in my mid 30s, so I did not mind this at all.  The only thing is as soon as I get carded, I know I'm probably headed into a bar full of people I could have babysat.

Not the case.  The patrons in the bar gave me the sense that this bar is where 'dreams go to die.\"  There was just something sad about the vibe.  I think it was the fact it was noon on a weekday and there were all these senior citizens at the bar.  No one was talking, and no one looked happy, and this may have been bc there wasn't a game on tv.  I dunno.

We sat outside on the deck.  the atmosphere was as nice as atmosphere can be when you're sitting next to a major intersection and trucks are going by.  There were some potted plants, so that helped.  And the deck is screened in, so it helped keep road debris out.

Our waitress looked like she'd been crying.  I felt really bad for her, and my friend asked me if we were in the 'twilight zone.'  this is when we made some hard decisions.  Do we leave, or do we just get shit faced drunk bc, you know, we're already here and all...  We stayed and got drunk, and ordered chicken strips.  They have a good variety of beers available and they're reasonably priced.

We were wasted.  Then we asked if we could order food, and the waitress reminded us we'd alreayd ordered food.  This was an hour and a half later.  There's very little I care about when drunk so I asked, \"Well, what's the status of the basket of chicken strips?\"  The waitress teared up again and siad there was a 'melt down in the kitchen' and that she would 'do what she could' for us.

Clearly there was also a melt down in the dining room.  

Then, some random dude vomited right outside the bar, basically right in front of us.  This is when we left.  Given the ridic nature of my visit there, I am certain this had to be a very off night.  I'd urge you to go there and tip the waitress with the peach hair veyr, very well.  She's apparently going through a lot right now."}
{"text":"I visited Bloomfield Bridge Tavern on Fri. evening around 6:15 with a friend from out of town and her dad.  I had been wanting to visit BBT for a long time, and her visit provided the perfect opportunity for me to try it while exposing my visitors to a very Pittsburgh-esque environment.  After battling the crazy traffic on Liberty due to the bridge closure, missing the entrance, and battling it yet again, we parked and made our way inside.

As others have mentioned, the interior is definitely divey, but not smoke-laden, unlike many other dive bars in PGH.  We were carded literally as soon as we walked in the door.  We originally thought we'd sit out on the porch, but decided against it, given that the porch is a smoking area.  At the time of our visit, it was pretty empty, with only a handful of locals seated at the bar, and a few people on the porch.  The environment was pretty quiet, given the sparse crowd and lack of music, allowing us to converse freely.

After perusing the menu, my friend and her dad each ordered a big hop ($5 each), and I ordered the Arsenal Cider on tap (Fighting Elleck; $6.50).  For food, I ordered 6 pierogies (2 potato/cheddar, 2 farmer's cheese, and two sauerkraut), which were on special for half off at the time of our visit ($0.75 apiece) with sour cream ($0.75, as I found out later), as well as an order of potato pancakes and applesauce ($5.95). My friend and her dad each ordered the red polish platter, which comes with kielbasa, a potato and cheddar pierogie, golabki, haluski, and kluski ($10.95 per platter).  All of the food was delicious and extremely filling, and the drinks helped to wash it all down.

Upon eating all of my pierogies, I noticed that, despite my request for 2 pierogies of each flavor, 3 sauerkraut and only 1 farmer's cheese had been included in my order.  I mentioned this to the woman who bussed our dishes (different from our waitress), and asked if I could have another farmer's cheese pierogie, since that was my favorite flavor.  She said she'd get one for me, and a farmer's cheese pierogie was brought out to correct the mistake at no charge.

Overall, all of us greatly enjoyed our visit to BBT.  I'd highly recommend it if you're in the mood for good Polish food, or are just looking for a genuinely Pittsburgh-esque eating experience. If possible, try to come on Fri. or Sat. between 5-7pm to take advantage of the half off pierogie deal! 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm 100% Polish and grew up with homemade Polish food from my grandparents, so I was excited to learn that there was such a highly praised polish restaurant in Pittsburgh.

My husband and I visited at around 8:00 on a Saturday night.  We almost weren't able to come in because I didn't have my wallet or any ID with me and apparently they have a policy that no one under 21 and/or without ID is admitted into the bar.  When I asked about take out, the bartender and waitress told us we could come in as long as I didn't drink (which I wasn't planning on doing anyway).  So if you visit in the evening or on a weekend, make sure you have ID!

It is a total dive bar atmosphere inside, but in this case, it adds to the charm and experience.  The menu is chock full of the typical bar food but then also has a nice selection of Polish options.  I started my order with the czarnina.  I grew up eating it and it isn't easy to find so I was excited to try it.  A few minutes later, the waitress came back and asked  me if I knew what it was and I said yes, duck's blood soup.  Apparently they ask because there are many people who don't know what the soup actually is.  It was good, but I don't know why it had such as high price tag at $8.95 and only $1 less than my main meal.  I liked the soup, but it lacked the prunes that I am used to from the soup my grandparents and the Polish restaurant in Buffalo usually make it with.  It was still full of flavor, though.

My husband and I both opted for the red platter which had sausage, kluski, haluski, pierogi and stuffed cabbage.  They also have a la carte options for all of the Polish items.  Everything we tasted was extremely flavorful, although they did overcook the sausage a bit.  I'm used to boiling my sausage and they grilled it, so it had quite a bit of char.  

The one down side is that there is one cook, so on a busy night, you will wait quite a while for your food.  Never fear, though, it is worth the wait.  And if you are an impatient person, there are TVs to watch, dart boards and some interesting people watching.

We'll be back.  But next time I'll make sure I bring my ID."}
{"text":"A Polish platter and a yuengling beer equals happiness. It really is a family bar.. there's a sign on the door cautioning you not to swear and a large picture of Pope John Paul II over the bar as well as year round Christmas lights illuminating his Holiness. I have seen many a father and young son eating Polish platters while Dad sips a longneck and sonny boy has an IBC root beer to try to be like dad.  As close to Christmas Eve as possible this place even has a Polish Christmas Carol night. 

Steer clear of the duck blood soup though. I didn't try it but my Dad said it was nothing like what his grandmother made. He dared me to try it but the iron smell of blood soup or blood pudding.. I just can't do it.

Also while the BBT does make a fine pierogi,  I don't think it's the best pierogi in Pittsburgh. St. John's in the South Side or Visitation in Mt. Pleasant are just as good or better."}
{"text":"**** beer
*** food
***** music

Yes, it's a dive bar.  100% I would not go in if I were not brought there by my friend.  

Their Polish food is ok, but that just me not a big potato fan. Foot portions are big.  I certainly would not finish it.  Feel bad cos the owner was very friendly, and it's not the food, it was just me cannot eat that much.

Music. ***** Tuesday open-stage is one of the best in town."}
{"text":"I'm not much for Polish food,but their pierogi is really good as is their haluski, kiebasa, and stuffed cabbage. I also like their mac n cheese bites. The sour duck's blood soup (forget the name) was interesting.  The decor is a little worn and could use some TLC. The owner, Steve, is supernice and will talk your ear off if they're slow like they were when we went in. Recommended. Very cheap too. A big plate of food was just 10 bux."}
{"text":"Went for a Slim Cessna show and was pleasantly surprised, somehow I had never been here before.

Specials included 1/2 off pierogies 5-7pm, $3 well vodka drinks 7-9 and $2.50 micro/import drafts 9-11. Yuengling is always $2.20. My favorite part of this was drinking East End Big Hop for $2.50 a pint for 2 hours.

As for the space, it's a fairly cramped pittsburgh bar, and runs with the best of 'em. Very nice outdoor patio that's heated during the winter for the smokers. Scene was mostly middle-aged folk, I expected to see a younger crowd, but it could have been because of the music.

With one bartender and one server (albeit both very friendly) service is painfully slow especially with loud music going on. That is my major critique, otherwise a good place for a show just make sure to bring some ear protection.

I'll be back for the pierogies."}
{"text":"Best polish food in Pittsburgh Hands down. Get the white platter. The pirogues are made by the bouncer's aunt. It is a chill bar where everyone is friendly that does not mean they aren't feisty. Beer gets cheaper as it gets later."}
{"text":"Good Polish food. The duck-blood soup tasted like my babcia (her family emigrated from Poland) used to make decades ago. 

Being half-Polish; I'm tough on restaurants selling Polish cuisine. This food is spot on."}
{"text":"Dough and potatoes sauteed in butter, a dive bar with Iron City on tap, super friendly people -- this place might just represent all that is good and pure left in the world.  I haven't been able to pry myself away from the pierogies long enough to try everything else on the menu, which I intend to do before the Stillers knock on seven's door.  The happy hour is a great deal, with half off on pierogies and cheap rotating brews.  I'm not giving it four stars only because the deck and dining room aren't terribly well separated, so it's often a little tough to breathe inside.  Although, I'm sure a pierogi expert could comment on how the smoky air balances the pillowy texture of the delicate pierogies..."}
{"text":"Surprise, surprise...I think I may like pierogies. I wouldn't call myself a pierogi connoisseur and honestly I've never really enjoyed the pierogies I've had. I always thought, \"What all the fuss about some dough stuffed with a bit of potato - or whatever they are stuffed with?!?!\" Well now I know! 

Went to BBT with a fellow Yelper and we got a sampling of the pierogies (the potato and cheese and the sauerkraut, we opted not to get the cottage cheese). I was expecting to have a similar experience of all the other times I've had a pierogi, but to my pleasant surprise this was quite different. 

The potato and cheese pierogies are really stuffed with potato and cheese so it's not like your tasting alot of dough with some potato flavor. The sauerkraut wasn't too krauty if that makes sense - it was alot milder than I thought it was going to be, but this was fine by me. I like sauerkraut but I think the milder flavor suited the pierogi. 

Thank you BBT for introducing me to pierogies I actually like!"}
{"text":"I happened into BBT on a rainy fall Thursday night. What a great coincidence. It was one of the best beer specials I've seen. $1.10 for any of the beers in the far cooler on the bottom two shelves (I believe). Not to mention the best pierogies on the serious cheap.

The owner was behind the bar and spent the majority of our short visit talking to us about the bar, the beer, and the food. It was comfortable and very inviting. 

I will most definitely be taking friends and heading back often."}
{"text":"Okay, so, my hubby, his cousin, and I wanted to try the wonderful polish platters at Bloomfield Bridge Tavery, so away we went.  When we first entered we noted that the bar was very dark and damp, and smelled like an old bar room.  Since we have all had our share of dive bars, and we had heard such good things about the food, we decided to stay.  My hubby and I each ordered the polish platter-red and his cousin ordered the polish platter-white.  Keep in mind while I describe the food, all of our grandparents are right off the boat from Poland, so we've all had our share of home cooked Polish food.  The polish platter-red featured, haluski, kluski, pierogi, gobki and kielbasa.  The haluski, kluski, and pierogi could barely be distinguished from each other, they were starchy blobs of flavorless overcooked pasta.  The kielbasa was not any kind of authentic home made kielbasa that any of us have ever eaten, but more likely Hillshire farms or some other sausagey type substitute.  Now the gobki was truly interesting.  We've all had it made with tomato puree, sauce, even soup, but hot sauce?  Really?  Gobki, is usually very delicate in flavor, not so hot that it kills your taste buds.  Sorry guys, but these polish folks will not be trying this place again."}
{"text":"I LOVE the BBT. I can't say that we go often, it's a bit out of the way for us, but every time I'm in the mood for something Polish this is where we go. 

The owner is a wonderfully nice man who could talk your hear off if he didn't have a million other customers. Remember, he has the second best Polish food you've ever had (right after your mom). 

I highly recommend trying the BBT! Ask if they are doing any sort of happy hour and try some Polish beer, you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Strange crowd, but good food
Eat pierogies made by your
Ancient Polish \"Mom\"."}
{"text":"Pyszne!!!!  Incredible food. Got the red platter so you get a lil bit of all that Polish goodness plus a cute little flag on top. The kluski was my favorite. Takes a little bit to get your food buts it's worth the wait. Staff is awesome. Owner came over and talked to us while we waited. Treat yourself to a sipper of the Polish blackberry brandy afterwards.  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"We ordered a Polish platter red and a Polish platter white. All of the food was excellent and very week prepared. Service was very friendly and good. Draft beer could have been colder but a very enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm, polish food and cheap beer... the stuff dreams are made of. 

I brought a group of people here to meet my Polish girlfriend (for the record she is from Chicago, not a mail-order from the motherland) and no one left disappointed. There were a number of pints on special that Saturday evening, the pierogis were pretty tasty, and the kielbasa was also quite good. One of the guys got non-Polish food - bbq wings I think - and said they were quite tasty. The only thing holding them back from 5 stars is that I felt that the amount of polish food I received for the price was a little disappointing, especially considering how tasty the food was and the estimated quantity of which I could've eaten. As we were leaving, a live band was setting up to play for the night, which I would've stuck around to hear if I wasn't in such a large group of people.

Despite the price of food, I would definitely go back for more pierogis and undoubtedly return for more beer (that kind of goes without saying, but it is nice to drive home a point at the end of a review)."}
{"text":"They get the extra star for the quirky fun staff, but the food is meh.  Best for a beer and appetizer, I wouldn't go here for a full on Polish meal.    It really does have a dive bar atmosphere, and they have a little outdoor section with one of those heater things for the colder months.  
I don't really understand why this place gets such high ratings though, I certainly didn't find anything outstanding about the place other than the friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for my Polish food fix for years. Pretty much everything on the polish part of the menu is good. Give me those perogies and the stuffed cabbage. Both are top notch. If you don't know what to get I suggest you try one of the Polish Platters which gives you a little portion of everything so you can find out what you like.  Perogies are half off from 5-7 everyday! I love to take my non-pittsburgh / non-polish friends here. 

Inside is pretty grungy, but in a good way. BBT even comes with one of those dungeon-like basement dive bar bathrooms. If the bar area is too grimy for your tastes, then feel free to take your food out to the deck area which is a great place to chill on warm summer nights. 

The owner is a Central Catholic guy, so mad props to that. In all seriousness he is a really nice guy and will chat with you for hours if you let him. 

Give BBT some credit for carrying East End Brewery on tap too!"}
{"text":"I guess the your opinion of the BBT is all about what you want. If you want to eat a meal and have a beer or two this place is fine, but the real attraction is Dollar Beer Night, on thursdays, where a selection of craft beer and some assorted lagers and domestics are on sale for 1.00+tax. 

The beer on Dollar Beer Night is... random. I have a feeling it is discount cases of beer or overstock. But that's not such a bad thing! I've had some really good beers that I never knew about! Arcadia Barlywine Ale was supurb, but that was the one time I found it. But most of the time it's kind of, well, the mediocre side of craft beer. But seriously, they're a dollar. 

I don't know anything about polish food really, but I know about a Kielbasa Sandwich, and theirs was damn good (damn good), but when I got it what I really ordered was their Sausage Sandwich, which was obviously similarly named, but on their menu and I normally want what I ordered. 

Stay away from the appetizers. The \"Bridge Fries\" are just microwaved fries with cheese on them. The fired mushrooms, cheese sticks and the rest of that sort of lot is always served very sparingly. The fried mushrooms are of the type that stay luke warm in the middle and hold water inside them, which is awful common, and I don't know what the difference is, but still very different than the ideal of a fried mushroom we all have in our head. There's nothing entirely bad about this lot, but nothing really good about it either. 

The atmosphere, well, it's okay. It doesn't really have anything to detract me from the place, especially on Dollar Beer Night, but again, there's nothing quite right and there's nothing quite wrong. Steve, the owner, just really doesn't seem to care much. His son provides service with a smile, and is probably good looking enough to keep a few women coming back, but isn't horribly engaging. The decor of the place is, non existent, I suppose you could say. The patio is nice. The inside is, well, I can't really think of anything to say about it. The bathrooms are proper dive bar, even though this place, to me, doesn't have dive bar cred. 

To me, this place doesn't have dive bar cred, except the dollar beers. The shots are 4.40 for well, yuenglings are 2.50, but that's not really rare. There isn't really anything amusing to keep me interested. There used to be pool in the basement, but now the pool table is covered with boxes of beer. 

BBT, you just need a little infusion. Just a little, but something. 

Let's put it this way, without the dollar beers, I don't come here, but see you on Dollar Beer Night."}
{"text":"This is Cheers.....well except it's in Pittsburgh. Bunch of guys sitting around the bar, a few tables to sit at and it. Owner is super friendly, sat and talked to us for a long time. OK, I've never really had Polish food.I found out,  except for the sausage, it is a little on the bland side. Lots of butter. It was good (they give you a huge portion and I almost finished mine). The Polish beer on tap was excellent,"}
{"text":"The Polish food looked amazing, but I already was full from dinner. My favorite feature of the bar was the men's restroom, which is in the basement. The door opens directly to the toilet and has no lock. It makes for odd introductions."}
{"text":"First off, the BBT is a great place to see a gig. The stage is small which leads to a very intimate experience. I've seen a band invite the crowd up on stage for a song which is as close as the audience can get. In between sets, you can go outside on the netted patio for a smoke or some air.

Beer-wise, they have about eight drafts on tap featuring a couple of regional staples and a few craft options.

The food menu is what makes the BBT a great night spot. They have a polish section featuring every Eastern European's favorite junk food: pierogies and kielbasa."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place literally my entire life, and I am now wondering what in the WORLD kept me from trying it until today!!! We both got the Polish Platter Red, because it was one of EVERYTHING and it was all so perfect!!!! My favorite was the stuffed cabbage and we both LOVED the pierogis!!! I'm of Eastern European decent so you best believe I have had more than my fair share of pierogis in my life, and I have to say these come second only to my late-grandmother's from when I was a kid! I would HIGHLY recommend checking this place out before they close in a couple months. Amazing staff, delicious food, and a great environment!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this Pittsburgh institution. After all, we used to live in Bloomfield, my sister in law is Polish, and I have a healthy love and respect for the pierogi. Not to mention haluski and kielbasa. And beer. And halupki.

So...we stopped at Bloomfield Bridge Tavern last Tuesday night after I taught an evening class. The place was dead silent, which was a bit odd. Honestly, I'm a beer person. I like places that have a nice selection on tap. And BBT was a definite disappointment in that regard. The food was okay, but honestly? I'd rather get my fill of Polish deliciousness from S&D in the Strip. I guess I just expected more.

The one thing that deserves 4 stars was the service. Our waitress was attentive and brought my water and our beers promptly. It may be worth revisiting on weekend night to give this local institution another shot."}
{"text":"A polish dive bar? With $2 drafts and $1.25 pierogis? You literally cannot ask for more in life. I am part polish, grew up eating my grandma's polish cooking, and I can safely say that the pierogi here contend with grandma's. Amazing place."}
{"text":"Came here with a group to celebrate two birthdays. The space on the porch was great for a group. Pierogies were good. Beer was good and nicely priced. 

Sadly, the band canceled for this particular saturday which left us with ...silence. The bar wouldn't play anything unless we paid $1/song at the jukebox. Paying for the jukebox should get you the privilege of hearing the song you want, not the privilege of hearing any song at all. 

Also, apparently they have a policy to make people buy bottled water instead of giving tap water. I'm not ok with this. What if someone wants to sober up so they can drive home? or if the designated driver wants to stay sober?  You should not have to pay for water at a bar. 

Note - this place is very strict about having the proper ID - it must be either a passport or a US driver's license. I was with a number of international students and they tried to show student IDs (that included birth dates on them). Not acceptable. come prepared or you will be turned away at the door."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place.  I've only been here on quiet, slow nights (never when there's been music).  The beer selection is decent, not great, but also not overpriced.  The Polish food is great (and I'm Polish), and the owner Steve is super-friendly.  He'll sit and chat with you all night if it's slow enough and you're in a talkative mood.  As far as I can tell, it's a generally laid-back place with a relaxed atmosphere.  That's not always what you're looking for, but when it is this is a great place to go.  Added bonus: As a non-smoker, I appreciate that I can go to BBT for a few beers and not leave stinking of smoke."}
{"text":"Staff is great, food is great, outdoor seating is great. I love the Polish food here so much! I have never tried any of the other food, so I cannot say if anything else is good. I appreciate that they do not salt any of their food. Some people may complain that the food is bland. But really, just throw some salt and pepper on it, and it's ready to go. In fact, it's probably smart that they don't salt the food because then they would run the risk of having overly salty food. This way, the food is as good as you make it with seasoning. Yum PIEROGIES!"}
{"text":"Went here and only stayed for two beers. Had a funny smell to it that didnt seem to go away. They had a bunch of weird $1 beer that we all considered trying but wussed out."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer prices, and great live music.

I was in a band that played there a handful of times, it was always good fun... and I loved getting pierogies or haluski before the gig.

Now we go just to enjoy the place & whatever else may be going on."}
{"text":"\"You're too young to have worked at St. Francis,\" Steve Frankowski, the owner of Bloomfield Bridge Tavern said to me as he sat down with us during our Polish dinner one frostibiter of a night not long ago.

Apparently, in another life, I worked with a number of the gregarious and sly-humored Mr. Frankowski's relatives during my 7 1/2 years as a hospital employee in various functions. 

Considering its proximity to what is now the new Children's Hospital, it's a little mystifying how my recent visit was my very first one and that I had only tried their food once before that.

Being of a family partly descended from Poland, I'm well-acquainted with cuisine from that nation, namely pierogi, kielbasa, stuffed cabbage (golabki), and the soup that prompted us to get takeout from BBT a decade and a half ago: Czarnina. 

Pronounced \"Cha-neena\", my father had been obsessed with it since his mother passed away and could no longer prepare it for him. I recall trying it but cannot recall if I enjoyed it. On this evening, Kay and I decided to gamble, sharing a bowl of the arcane, foreboding, boiling elixir...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL46HxN8gVE

Made from duck's blood (don't run!) and chicken stock, the blackened brew resembles a French Onion soup, but upon first sip,  its obscenely tangy flavors will electrify your palate. Frankowski told us that Asian-American visitors will often tell him that they pay upwards of $20 for bowls of a similar Asian soup in other cities. At BBT, it only costs 9 bucks. Lush noodles bobbed their heads from the murky pool like ivory sea serpents, carrying the occasional ragged morsel of savory, fatty duck on their backs. 

Our second opener was a helping of Mac 'N Cheese bites so volcanic, they took quite a spell to cool sufficiently for our tender mouths, but when they did, we were treated to crispy nuggets of gooey, lardy bar food bliss. 

For just one measly 10 spot, each of us was presented with a Polish Platter. Mine was \"Red\", meaning it came with a heap of delicacies that included kielbasa, pierogi, golabki, kluski, and haluski. The plates barely held all of the food. I had to eat with caution initially for fear of losing anything to the floor below. 

The highlight was a charred kielbasa as sweet and juicy as a ripened orange, but the doughy pierogi, the hearty golabki, and the filling kluski (a dish of noodles and cottage cheese) and haluski (cabbage and noodles) acted as a crack backing band for the lead singer as a wooden bear looked on in the shadowy environs.

A touch of seasoning might have ramped the flavors up a notch, and the decor and furniture are somewhat worn, but with fare this lovingly prepared, one doesn't notice what is essentially a dive, albeit a popular one that often features live music. 

\"Y'know, we used to have 'em. We had one in particular. It was a big brownie, but damn it if the cook wasn't eating the profits! We were always out of it, and when I'd ask the cook why, his mouth would be stuffed, and he'd have crumbs all over him. I had to fire him!\" Frankowski whimsically stated with a glint in his eye and his tongue in his cheek when I asked about desserts. 

Just as he was about to bid us adieu, two 20 something women wandered in, ran up to Frankowski, and hugged him as fiercely as they would an all-too-seldom-seen uncle. \"I haven't seen you since I was in college! I came back to town to say hi. I miss this place! I miss you,\" one of them said. \"Oh, my girls,\" Frankowski responded. \"How are you both doing?\" From there, an almost teary reunion commenced. 

Bloomfield Bridge Tavern occupies a special shelf in the minds of young Pittsburghers, be they long-time townies, transplants, or those who are merely passing through. I myself am going to try to pass through more often, particularly when the place is livelier, more populated, and not so dimly lit. Perhaps BBT could use a sprucing up too. Wait. On second thought, why change what already works? If those two pretty young things didn't mind, why should you or I?"}

The Bloomfield Bridge Tavern has all of the makings of a GOOD dive bar. There are divey bars that are dirty and gross where I would never dream of touching the food. And then there are the divey bars that are just grungy enough to give it character, and where you feel just brave enough to try the food, and you are so glad that you did! The BBT is definitely the good kind of dive bar. 
The food here was way way better than I expected. The Polish specialties are spot on. By far the best perogies I've ever had, and the stuffed cabbage was incredible as well. I'm not usually one for kielbasa, but here it is a different story. Normally its greasy and chewy, but somehow at the BBT it comes out perfectly charred and super tender. 
There is something very PITTSBURGH about the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern, and I will definitely be stopping back in the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Pittsburgh I crashed my bike (hard) crossing the street on the way to the BBT and I still partied through the pain and had a great time. Seriously, these are the best pierogies I've ever had. $1 each, huge, and served with caramelized onions. I recommend potato-cheese. Go for $1 beer nights (they even had this during the Stanley Cup). Talk to the older guy that works there (possibly owns it?), he's a sweetheart. Just be careful if you're new and on bike-- it might look like a painted white line in the middle of Liberty here, but it's actually raised about an inch off the road."}
{"text":"Ok, so I live in Portland, Oregon, and have for many years now, but grew up in Pittsburgh and thought I'd check out the Yelp scene in the 'burgh.  Seriously, you guys need to get writing!  Don't be making my hometown look bad.

And the BBT.  It became a regular spot for me the summer after college, and the last time I held a PA address.  When I was visiting home last November I went back to the BBT with my father, who occasionally does open mic night there.  Ever since, when telling people about Pittsburgh, I bring up the BBT with a happy glaze in my eye and a slight smirk.  Portland only wishes it could have a \"dive bar\"  so steeped in history, so unassumingly cool..oh, and the perogies.  

XOXO BBT!

P.S. I think I've been away from Pittsburgh to long because I forgot how to spell pero...pier..you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Posting because a friends post got deleted (real smooth, yelp.) I have honestly never had a more uncomfortable bar experience than here. My friend and I went to see a band perform, but accidentally came an hour early. We figured we would order drinks but were still thinking about what we wanted, and the waitress was extremely outright rude and sarcastic with us. We were younger than the general demographic of bar \"regulars,\" but I'm tired of being treated like crap at bars like these despite the fact that I'm a 20-something. I have a good job and money I would love to spend at a nice bar with friendly staff and good beer and music-- unfortunately, this is not the place for that. Young people who want to be treated with respect, steer clear."}
{"text":"The beer is cheap.  The bartender is great.  The food is unique.  The music is stellar.  This is easily one of the best bars you'll find.

Tuesday night had singer/songwriters cheering each other on, no cover, $2.20 bottles (including Abita Turbo Dog), and $1 Straub drafts.  Had a red platter, which is kluski, halupki, kielbasa, and pierogie, golubki, all of which I've butchered the spelling of.  

Wednesday night has the best drum 'n bass for any night of the week for maybe two hundred miles around.  Gets busy around 10 PM.  $3ish cover, which used to include free wings, and may still include it.

Thursday night, no idea what was going on musically, but Tuesday's bottles were only $1.

There's a heated outdoor smoking area; the indoor area of the bar is smoke free ish, and the outdoor area is about ten feet away.  Everyone kind of wins."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since moving to Pittsburgh last fall. Totally a dive bar and I love how unpretentious it is.

The first time I had gone we were greeted by the bartender/owner? but then were apologized to for not having any pierogis. I guess they had ran out during a happy hour. Waitress came by and before she took our order said BBT was sorry that they no longer had pierogis but made some other recs. We were bummed about the pierogis but each ordered the kielbasa sandwich. And man o man the kielbasa arrived (though it took a while) and wow it was fantastic. Little crispy on the outside and some good flavor with the sauerkraut and mustard. On our way out, the bartender/owner again apologized for not having pierogis though told us to come back and I sure made a note to. You definitely feel at home being in place like BBT.

I came back a second and third time to bring some out of towners and BBT did not disappoint again though this time they did not run out of pierogis. Red plate special along with some beer. I haven't had any thing but polish food at BBT though do not plan on deviating from it. The nights they have bands play are fun too."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and never had a bad experience. They feature local music in a dive atmosphere. They serve Polish food which is somewhat unique in the area."}
{"text":"4.5--the white polish platter was yummy!!  Carbo loading for sure. Cabbage was perfectly cooked. The pierogi was plentiful and hot. A little hot sauce and you're set. No music though--just wheel of fortune on the tube. Lots of hip locals. Friendly staff. Got carded--at my age that's worth four stars!"}
{"text":"I've only been here for cheap drink and listen to the live bands. But damn, do those pierogies smell amazing! I want to say I'll be back to give them a go, but word on the street is that BBT is shutting down. :( Some sort of lawsuit situation. Sorry to seem them go, not sorry that I no longer have to try not to break my neck getting down to their restroom."}
{"text":"I was dazed from traveling and life and attempted to go to this bar. My non-Polish family nick named me the Polish Prince as a child and I used that as a boxing name and street moniker for many years after. I talked to a friendly couple outside who were there for the filming of Restaurant Impossible next door at Del's. I asked if dude was in there bench pressing. I had cup of coffee in hand. Opened door and hit doorman in elbow. He said \"Hey you cant bring that in here.\" I said \"It's just coffee.\" He said \"Just drink it up.\" I said \"Even if I'm Polish? He said \"I understand you being Polish. Just finish it up.\" There was way too much coffee in that cup to do so. I said \"Don't worry about it\" and walked out. They should not be able to fly that proud eagle if you can't allow a fellow Polish brother into your little bar because he was carrying coffee. This changed my belief: I never thought I would meet a Polish person that I didn't really like. I will just eat my Mom's pierogies later this month at Christmas. They will taste better. I just went across the street for Thai food and had a great dinner with people who actually respected me."}
{"text":"Gave it a try based on the reviews.  Unfortunately the food was very disappointing.  The food was not close to authentic Polish food.  The Kielbasa in particular was very bad and the potato pancakes dreadful. I will say I am of Eastern European descent and have traveled throughout the region so my standard is probably very different than most.

...and to top it off you had to pay extra for a soft drink refill.  I just find that irritating."}
{"text":"Very comfy dive-y kind of bar, tucked in by the bridge (as advertised). The owner claimed that his food \"is the second-best Polish food you'll ever eat.\" Of course, the best Polish is what your mom, aunt or grandmother makes! (What a charmer.)

We popped in for dinner early, and got a good look at the menu. All the Polish food! We ordered potato pancakes (which were more like actual pancakes, very dense), the duck soup, and the red platter.

The duck soup. Our server did pause, and said, \"You want me to tell you what is in the soup before you order it, or else you'll hate me.\" Well, there is sauerkraut, duck, duck blood, and noodles. Very deep, sour flavor - absolutely something we'd eat, but we were glad for the heads-up that this was not a mild-tasting soup.

The red platter had kielbasa (nice snap and spice), golabki (decent), pierogi, haluski and kluski. We ordered this one to split and were glad - so much food!

We felt very welcome, and we'll get back here when we're in the Burgh next."}
{"text":"The bar scene in Pittsburgh both confuses and fascinates me. The South Side seems to have evolved into the frat house of the city and if you're over 30, you don't belong there. My favorite spot in Lawrenceville, Round Corner Cantina, has been overtaken by a random crowd of hipsters, aging yuppies, and college kids venturing out of South Side and gets too packed for me to enjoy my time there. So over the past couple of years, we've had to adjust where we grab a few drinks on the weekends. 

BBT has always been there. It's also been a popular spot for shows, drum and bass night, and dollar beer night. We've always overlooked her like the wallflower stading in the corner at the school dance. Well, once we had been moved out of our usual haunts like Cantina and Kelly's, it was time to give BBT a chance. 

We've been to BBT 3-4 times in the past 6 weeks or so and have been happy with both the food and the service. We had heard all about the amazing Polish food and had to try the pierogies and halushki (cabbage noodles). I love their homemade pierogies as they are really stuffed full of filling and are finished off with a quick sear on the griddle, butter, and fried onions. The halushki was a leap of faith for me. Growing up on the stuff, there's only one way I like it - my way - cabbage and noodles. Period. I've had it with onions, bacon bits, or partially cooked cabbage. Fail. Fail. Fail. BBT gets it spot on with noodles and cabbage sauteed until it's nice and sweet. 

My last visit I orderd a Bridge Burger and it would have been really good had it not been overcooked. We waited longer than usual for our food that night, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt for having an off night. 

It's a dive bar. It's dark and showing age, but we like it that way. It's never too crowded and we can always get a table. Plus I'm really impressed that they actually stick to the \"no smoking\" rule! I've been to so many bars in Pittsburgh that serve food and still allow smoking. Isn't that against the law?"}
{"text":"Excellent local bar in a great location.  Enjoyed watching the sun set from their outdoor patio.  Best feature:  the Polish food.  Cabbage rolls are the best!"}
{"text":"Another Pittsburgh institution. Where else can you watch bands play while eating homemade pierogies and drinking cold brewskis?"}
{"text":"Fantastic local bar with well above \"bar food\" food!  As soon as I walked I could smell the sweet aroma of perogies (and NOT smoke!).  I knew I was in polish heaven!  

Not only was the bartender extremely friendly, but so were all the patrons!  We even got a free drink from a happy patron (his b ball team won that night).  Score!

I went in sorta hungry and sorta wanting to try the food everyone has been raving about, but not sure.  Well, I kept staring at the dudes stuffed cabbage next to me to the point that I was probably starting to make him feel awkward.  So I decided it was gonna happen.  I was gonna order me some polish food!  

I had to do the whole shebang!  And seriously, $1.99 for each for stuffed cabbage (3 min) and $.99 for pierogies (3 min), how could I say no!  They have three different perogies, cheese and potato, sauerkraut and cottage cheese. You want to know the amazing thing?  Instead of having to order your choice in 3's, you can have one of each!  So I ordered them all, for the sake of trying, of course!  They were all delish, with my fav being a toss up b/n the tater and sauerkraut.  

Wait, this is a bar?! Who cares about the beer when you can have excellent polish food!  Obviously you know where my heads at!  I can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu.  They don't call it the \"Polish Party House\" for nothing.  Let the food party begin!"}
{"text":"I love the BBT as a cheap dive bar and for the great polish food.  I almost always get some pirogies and some kielbasa.  Most times after I order I see an old polish woman come out from nowhere and start cooking up my food!  It is definitely not health food, the 'rogies come out dripping in butter with some onions (and some sour cream), and the keilbasa comes simply as a giant delicious mouth watering link on a plate.  Although if there is a group of people who order different types of  'rogies you are almost guaranteed not to receive the mixture you ordered.  The live local music is fun, the beer fridge has a decent variety and a $1 bottle night on Thursdays, and their fries are good for snacking too!"}
