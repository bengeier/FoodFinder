{"text":"This was the first time having our lunch in this restaurant. Somehow I was kind of craving for Korean food today. I was searching yelp for a different Korean restaurant in that area, but it's under internal renovation. It ended up my friend and I went into this place and tried their food. 

I felt so happy to have found this place for our Korean food. There was lots of side dishes - complimentary to serve on the table including a large pancake and it's so yummy too. We ordered one pollack soup, one hot pot bulgogi and extra noodles $2.50 to add into our hot pot. 

All the food came out fast and served to us on the table by a very friendly lady called JJ. I really like the bulgogi with its flavorful soup base here, as compared with other Korean places. Fish is always one of my favorite food and of course I almost finished up everything from the pollack bowl... 
I will definitely recommend this place to my friends and will come back for more dishes..."}
{"text":"There are many Korean restaurants along Yonge Street in the North York / Thornhill area and there doesn't seem to be anything obviously distinctive about this one, other than a friend's recommendation. He's a chef and I trust his word.

Walking in, the space is small but cozy. The tables have portable butane burners on them. We were greeted and seated by a very friendly young lady who appeared to be taking care of all the tables, and quite efficiently.

There were several things on the menu that caught my attention but I settled on the Chicken with Green Onions. My dining companions chose the Steamed Egg and a hot pot dish with tripe (not on my list of favourite things to eat). We also got a spicy Monkfish dish.

One thing I really like about Korean restaurants is all the side dishes that are included - spicy bean sprouts, kimchi, tofu, and a few others. They started us off with a kimchi pancake. Mmm, they all tasted good!

The hot pot arrived at our table, still boiling, and our server fired up the portable burner to keep it going. It looked good. So did the monkfish, with spicy bean sprouts and chili peppers. The steamed egg looked delicate and fluffy, perfect. We were told, before ordering, that the chicken would take a little longer. No problem, lots of side dishes to munch on while my companions devoured their tripe hot pot.

It didn't take much longer for the chicken to arrive. It was boneless pieces, battered and deep fried, and covered with a mountain of green onions. I mean a whole crop's worth of green onions! It came with sauce that our server said we should pour over it.

All the food tasted really good! The ingredients were fresh and even all the side dishes were very well prepared, compared to many other Korean restaurants I've been to.This is what sets them apart from the rest.

The service was also very good. Our server managed to take care of all the tables and checked on us several times, refilling our water and tea each time. The owners also dropped by to say hello and check on us. Nice personal touch.

Excellent food and service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was craving for Korean for while, and since I found this place on Yelp, I was dying to try this place. 

We ordered BBQ pork belly, and spicy octopus. We got kimch, daikon kimchi, cucumber kimch, seasoned bean sprout and Korean pancake as appetizer. The kimch! I love their kimch. I know I've been saying kimch a lot, but it was that good. 

I thought the rice will come with dishes, but it was extra order. But still, I really appreciate that I found this place. Thanks, Yelp!!!"}
