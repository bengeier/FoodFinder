{"text":"Consistently good..love the Mancini raisin toast. Friendly, prompt service! Best breakfast in town!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go here every Sunday.  They have specials only on Sundays which are always so delicious.  There are about 8 different specials to choose from, varying from different omelets to sweet embellished waffles or French toast.  Their basic menu is also widely expansive.  Besides the awesome food selections are the amazing people that work there.  They are always so friendly and accommodating, I cannot recommend this place enough"}
{"text":"Good little greasy spoon, where the spoons aren't greasy. I got the Hot Turkey Sandwich with Fries. She got the pancake with strawberries and whipped cream with a side of bacon.

My sandwich was pretty good. Big thick pieces of toast. Crispy golden fries. The gravy was pretty bland but was still good (and plenty of it). The turkey was good lunch meat turkey. I'm picky about my turkey. Only complaints was the turkey was still cold before they put it all together.

We were going to get two pancakes but the waitress recommended just one because they were huge. We took her word for it. The pancake pretty much took up the whole plate. She loved it and I snuck a bite here and there. She couldn't even finish it. The bacon was thick, crispy and tasty.

All in all, cool little hole in the wall diner spot. One of the better places in the neighborhood. Too bad they close to early (2pm)."}
{"text":"If you're looking fancy decor, fagghetabatit. If you want a great breakfast for a reasonable price, go here. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is just like stepping back into time.  Definitely old school interior and exterior.  It's very dark inside, no windows except for the ones in the front door.  That definitely gives it a lot of character. We went on a Sunday morning for breakfast.  It was packed inside.  We had to wait a  few minutes for a table, but not long.  Most customers were senior citizen regulars who ate and left pretty quickly.  I got the Pittsburgh omelet which had sausage, peppers and onions.  It was pretty good and tasty.  It was served with Mancini's bread (could have been toasted a little longer), and home fries (pretty average, but still tasty).  My partner got the hungry man which had a little bit of everything.  He said everything was cooked well and tasty.  Pancakes were nice and fluffy.   Definitely come here if you want the basics done right.  Nothing fancy or crazy creations.  Just the classics and a cool atmosphere you can't replicate."}
{"text":"This place is such a gem! My boyfriend lives in the Southside and if we're not in a rush on the weekends we'll drive up to Carrick for breakfast at Gary's. The decor is reminiscent of a 90's small-town Italian restaurant (think plastic plants, brick arches, etc.) but the food is actually REALLY great diner breakfast. We've never waited for a table and never paid more than $15 for breakfast and coffee for the two of us. I would definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Gary's is a hidden gem in Carrick that I missed out on for years! I have lived in Carrick my whole life and only within the last two years decided to give them a try. I am so glad I finally did! 

From the outside, you don't know what to expect- there aren't many windows on the outside. When you walk in, you will be surprised with how many tables the place has. It's definitely outdated in terms of the decor and furniture- but I kind of love the old school feel of the place. 

Their food isn't going to knock your socks off- but it's very good and VERY reasonably priced. My boyfriend and I have never had a $20 bill , it has always been under and we have always left full and happy. 

Fluffy pancakes, crispy bacon, thick toast, crispy home fries and omelettes that are packed to capacity-- their food never disappoints! Service is always awesome. And it has never been crowded when my boyfriend and I have come on the weekends (we are late comers though- eating breakfast around 12-1 usually). 

Anytime I want an awesome breakfast but don't feel like driving far to get it- Gary's is my first choice!"}
{"text":"I didn't even know it existed and I lived not too far away. It is a wonderful place for breakfast -- delicious pancakes and even better french toast. My husband and I usually get 1 of each then split them so we get a little of both. Very reasonably priced as well!"}
{"text":"Just a perfect little Diner nothing fancy but  clean, warm and  inviting with friendly staff good food and great pricing. This is the kind of place I would go with my grandmother and grandfather when I was a kid. No matter what people say don't ever change folks... you nailed it... the warm coziness of visiting your grandparents. Not to many places like this exist much anymore in America, but luckily around Pittsburgh we have a few."}
{"text":"This is literally out my back door! Having a bowl of cauliflower and cheese soup and a GIANT fish sandwich! Stop in and try it out!
 Reasonable prices, good food, and friendly staff! GREAT Sunday breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Great little place for breakfast and lunch. I had the Greek omelette, potatoes & toast, everything was really good. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Gary's has been around for over 20 years. It's a small place that's only open for breakfast and lunch. We go for breakfast there so I've never seen their lunch menu. The breakfast menu is straightforward. I typically get the same thing-1 egg, 3 strips of bacon, home fries, and toast. They use Mancini bread for the toast. YUM!!!!  They have other menu items like pancakes and waffles. I keep thinking I will order something different but I always order the usual. Bacon and eggs is a comfort food for me. Eating at Gary's is like eating home cooking. Who doesn't want that???"}
{"text":"I love this joint! From the outside one would assume it's probably just got a lunch counter inside, but there's a whole cozy sit-down area. The food is delicious and reasonably priced, the people who work there are warm and personable and will remember you (and what you like to eat). The portions are generous, when I eat in I almost always need a box for leftovers. They offer carry-out which I love. The only beef I have with this place is that I wish they were open later. Other than that, it's all aces!"}
