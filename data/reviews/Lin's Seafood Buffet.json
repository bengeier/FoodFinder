{"text":"Took family to dinner at Lin's Seafood buffet and i am 100% agree with all the bad comments.This is the worst place i have ever eaten before. Most of the foods are old and poor selections. This place also expensive to eat at $14.99 per person. I got sick when i got home. Don't go eat at this place and save your money.."}
{"text":"The food tasted good but wasn't hot.  In fact, it was barely warm.  The place was a ghost town at 7 pm on a Tuesday which isn't a good sign considering all the promotion lately and the size of the restaurant.  $28 later for two people, we are leaving hungry, disappointed and wishing we would have listened to other yelpers.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"This buffet has more selection and better quality than many buffets on the strip in Vegas. I think the price is about $20/person for dinner, which is a fair price for a place this nice. I think their biggest problem is their location- they aren't in an area where people can afford to spend 20 bucks a person. If you have that kind of money, though, it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"bad food?roach?i saw them in the floor?i couldnot think the kitch is?omg?we eat the roach?donnot go there to eat the roach?"}
{"text":"was going to go there for dinner 2nite. read the health dept. report in glendale/peoria today paper.they had 6 priority,3 priority foundation and 8 core violations this inspection. also had 7 2nd consecutive repeat violations. and 1 3rd consecutive repeat violation. the report took up half the page! this place should be closed down b4 some 1 gets sick. glad i read this b4 i went to eat there. disgusting."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews, a friend and I decided to give it a try.   Right when we walked in we were amazed at the size and how clean it was. We were greeted by a friendly host.  Now on to the important part, the food. The selection is huge! The food was hot and good. For a buffet this is one of the best in this area."}
{"text":"I was charged twice for 4 adults.  we had a $16 coupon for this ticket and were charged for the amount with the coupon taken off and also another charge for the full amount. I have tried numerous times to have the manager give credit and 22 days later still haven't had any response,only promises. We were not disappointed in the food,but to pay twice for the same meals makes you think twice about going back."}
{"text":"I would literally give this place no stars. we walked in waited 10 minutes to get sat. we should have known something was wrong because there were like a couple people in there. the food looked like it had been there all day long. I had gotten ice water to find all this stuff flotting in it. the soup was all stuck like it Haden's even been stirred. stuff was just dry or empty. everything was disgusting. to top it all off the employee walked by the crab legs and touched them to put the ones sticking out in the pan WITH DIRTY HANDS, we had seen this man eating in the corner. a lady right next to us told us that this place is expensive and disgusting & she was not lying . we paid $60.00 for 3 people for it to be gross. we ask to speak to the manager just go find out the guy who touched the crab legs was the manager. we confronted him about eating in front of people and then touching the food with his dirty hands and he literally had no excuse. he refused to talk and told the host to give us our money back. we couldn't even eat we were so disgusted. but we didn't even want our money back , it's so sad that people pay like 15$$  for this food that can get someone severely sick."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about a year and half when they first opened the food was great wide selection including fresh sushi I started having bad experiences with old food and freshness I thought maybe It was a once off situation I've given three more times going back after the last time I'm done food was horrible service was still good very good ice cream cups and container was fithy if offering ice cream get a soft serve machine and stop serving left over two day old cafeteria food"}
{"text":"Endless shrimp  and crab legs for 15.99 better than Red Lobster period. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"went for lunch buffet. sign on door says closed for repairs. anyone know whats going on?"}
{"text":"This is now called NY seafood buffet This was worst food the boy that was behind the grill sitting on the floor on cell phone then he stood up took my plate continue to text the whole time cooking playing with his ear. Something leaking in front of the grill the grill was dirty. Cold food at the buffet tasted awful. Expensive just plain dirty! The Dr Pepper was good waiter was nice"}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch and was a little disapointed. I have been here before and the food was pretty good. This time it seemed a little off. I did not care for the fried shrimp as it was cold and greasy. The sushi was tasteless, as were a few other items. So I filled up on white rice & egg foo young. I probably will go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Please do not eat here!!!!  I have been sick the last 2 days from eating at this disgusting place. 1st. Upset stomach and diarrhea now add body aches and swollen glands.  Board of health please lock the doors!!!!"}
{"text":"I saw this Lin's and wish I had kept on driving. I just left there and am feeling sick already. I had egg drop soup which was just lukewarm so I didn't eat it. Fried shrimp was ok, coconut shrimp was too sweet. There are a lot of selections, problem is they don't look too good. The cod and salmon looked very dried out. Thought I'd try the stir fry grill but when I got there and saw the guy cooking was dripping sweat off his forehead into the food, I changed my mind. For $13.99 it is way overpriced. The server never came back to refill water or see if we needed anything, only time I saw him was when he brought the check. All that was written on the check was. W2, no price. Took the ticket to the front and the girl there asked if this was all he gave me, then shook her head. Oh, I can't forget the sticky floors, my  shoes kept getting stuck. Clean your floors! I will never go back here and can't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Really! This place is worse than the previous incarnation - Hibachi Grill or whatever it was called. I was hoping that new name/new management = much better buffet. No dice. It was like eating at a bad cafeteria - vegetables oversalted, meat overcooked, and everything just generally bland. And the worst part is the Grand Opening banners are still up. Is this the best it's going to be? It was also quite pricey per person. If I'm paying that much I might as well go to Pacific Seafood Buffet. Pretty pricey but much better quality.   Meet the new buffet Same as the old buffet   I'll take a bite of the sweet orange chicken Take a bowl of the spicy egg drop soup Smile and grin at the fools all around me Pick up my tab and pay Just like yesterday And I'll get on my knees and pray We don't get fooled again"}
{"text":"I confess, I love Chinese and really love Chinese Buffet. After hearing mixed reviews of Lin's Seafood Buffet at 51st Ave & W. Bell, we decided to give it a try. I left neither satisfied or full. Actually, I am praying I don't get sick. Crab that smells like ammonia, and ribs smell like, well, dog food. Maybe dog ribs? Lin's is clearly at the bottom of the list of places to return to. Yes, it was busy, Valentine's Day. But is that an excuse for many empty tables piled with dirty plates in our service area. Oh yes, we actually had to chase the server down to get our bill. Food quality isn't even in the same class as Pacific Seafood Buffet at 83rd & Bell. Pacific is in a buffet class by themselves. Unfortunately, so is Lin's. But they are close to a hospital."}
{"text":"Read reviews with many to be more cold than warm however, decided to give this restaurant a try just because I am a sucker for good seafood and a buffet can be quite delicious.  The place is much bigger inside than it looks from the outside and is in a strip mall on the southeast corner of Bell and 51st Ave.  The decoration isn't bad and kind of interesting though the booths are uncomfortable, the wrong height and the tables with booths are in a horrible arrangement so you are forced to share space with other tables and at this visit, with about 15 young children.  The food was either too sweet or seemed to be old.  The crab legs were pretty terrible (cold and tasteless), the few seafood dishes they do have were either tasteless or seemed very unappetizing.  Some of the dishes were warm although I would not consider them fresh.  The mussels and clams had a strange odor and looked horrific.  There used to be a seafood buffet on Camelback that closed and I had hoped this place could fill the space but sadly, there are way too many issues.  The servers were nice and the place seemed fairly clean which makes the food so much more unfortunate.  Skip this place for now....maybe the reviews will help them improve."}
{"text":"Folks, look at the reviews most everyone has posted thus far: they're all 1-star, and for good reason. Unless you enjoy playing food poison roulette and crave tasteless, off-temperature buffet items, choose somewhere else. This miserable excuse for dining can't die a quick enough death for us Yelpers.  Hibachi Grill shut down months ago, but it's phoenix-like reincarnation has risen once again. However, nothing has changed and if it has it's for the worse. Most entree items are NOT to health code temperature so diners, beware! Turnover is very low which means entrees are not fresh. Their idea of \"sushi\" is true gastric health gambling. The sashimi appeared dried out, and even the tamago was more brown than yellow. Three so-called sushi \"chefs\" stood with arms crossed, leaning against a table, for the entire duration of our visit. They could have made rolls or nigiri to order with as many available hands as were sitting idle -- at least then it would have been fresh.  Much of what I tried was truly a gastronomic disaster: tasteless, lacking spices, and of poor quality and/or temperature. The only positives: a courteous waiter (who oddly asked our opinion on the quality of the food) and wonderfully sweet and flavorful watermelon, strawberries, and muskmelon. But none of that justifies $25.98 for two people with no fountain drinks AND a $3 off coupon.  This was a once-and-done visit. I encourage other Yelpers to bypass this place for another buffet, one where you don't have to worry for 12 hours after eating whether or not you'll be heaving your duodenum out your mouth."}
{"text":"This buffet just opened Friday in the spot were Hibachi Grill used to be and it looks the same with the really funny resteroom sign that I tried to photo but couldn't. Sadly I left hungry with an upset stomach over the foods I tried. I started with some sushi that sort of looked dried out and when I tried a piece the rice wasn't seasoned and was just gooey and fell apart.I was hoping for some tasty seafood since this is a seafood buffet. I\"m not sure I did SEE FOOD but I saw cod and what they called salmon that was a white flesh fish here. I really like fish and I wasn't able to eat either of them the taste was too offensive. I put some vegetables on my plate but the broccoli was mushy and had a strange taste to it.   Since I still didn't eat almost anything I decided to try the Mongolian stir fry. I picked some vegetables that looked good and some chicken. The stir fry guy asked me if I wanted teriyaki or soy sauce so I picked soy sauce. He chopped, he slopped sauced it up a bit and he twirled the spatula around a bit for show. It looked OK to me but it tasted awful like an 8 year old made it. The chicken was extremely dry I couldn't eat it but the way it tasted was just awful like all just soy sauce.   They had one salad that wasn't completely awful but it tasted like old fish, it was the seaweed with cucumbers and radish. I was able to pull out the radishes and eat the radishes but the rest tasted very fishy.  The chicken on a stick was sweet and weird tasting. (YUK)  My husband tried to eat an octopus and he said it was just like rubber.  They didn't have much in the way of prepared stir fry dishes.  I tried a piece of battered chicken that was OK and a couple of cold french fried that were edible.  I did like the bean paste stuffed bun that looked like a peach.   The fresh grapes were very good.  I saw loquats so I took some. I popped one in my mouth and had to spit it out because it tasted like something meaty was on it.   They just opened maybe they will get better and just don't have it together yet?  I also note I didn't try everything so MAYBE they had some good dishes? I didn't try? However I will never return.  As only a slight update This Buffet was featured on 5-16-13 on Dirty Dining with 11 major health code violations. (no wonder why stuff just didn't taste right) So you should check the Maricopa Co. Health Inspections before you dine here.  ANOTHER slight update Aug-22-13  6 major health code violations according to Dirty Dining on KPHO"}
{"text":"The Food was horrible \"not fresh\". When I was asked by the manager how my meal was I told her how the fish tasted she replied \"she eats it all the time and there is nothing wrong with it\". I should have taken the hint when this place is huge inside and there are no patrons eating there. They have no conscience to serve people food like that. It goes by the name \"New York Seafood Buffet\". $17.00 for inedible food. 06/10/15            Kurt R."}
{"text":"Ok after seeing some mixed review I decided to give it a try and report my experience at this place. I am here as j write this review.   First I cannot comment on what this place was 6 to 8 months ago I can only report my experience as of today.   This is is better than other buffet places out there. The food is pretty good and well with the money. I tried a variety of things and they were all good to me. The service was good the server refreshed my drink immediately and the place was clear and the decor was new and warm. For a meal under 13 bucks I will definitely repeat. To sum it up this place is good Buffett food for a low price.   That's my review. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Horrible. 16 bucks got me the buffet and a drink. For half the money I could have gone to Long John Silvers, I would have been better off. For the same money I could have gone to Red Lobster and been happier. They should work on more quality not quantity. Most of the food was unappealing and cold. The fried shrimp was really good. That's about it."}
{"text":"The place looks not so clean and the food tastes bland compared to other buffets! Look someplace else."}
{"text":"I thought this buffet was pretty dang good. Really clean, huge selection, the food is hot, and the desserts are plentiful."}
{"text":"I don't know why people gave this buffet resto low ratings? Do you guys really know good food? I'm a food lover(foodholic) & I always love to try to go to different restaurants just to try it( food adventure is fun ) I love exploring different kind of cuisines. So I guess for me I really like Lin's because of its affordable price, nice atmosphere & it's clean. I can't say it's the best Chinese buffet or food that I've ever tried but it's good."}
{"text":"1st and last time! Just paid 39.05 for me and my husband. The food seemed like it had been sitting all day. this place is by far hands down the worst possible place to eat at. Seriously I think I will be sick. Please don't eat here!! Edited 45min later-yup I'm sick"}
{"text":"DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO THE BAD REVIEWS.  I have a feeling this site is being hacked by the competition.  That being said on with my review ....  This extremely CLEAN, FRIENDLY and DELICIOUS buffet is a delight.  I normally don't care for buffets so for me to want to leave a review speaks volumes.  The food was fresh, hot (or cold on ice) and tempting.  I wish I could give it 4-1/2 stars and it would be a 5 star if there were more dishes with veggies.  I plan to return soon bringing friends with me."}
{"text":"It was nicely decorated and clean.  They do have many things to pick from but most of the food was dry.  The wonton soup was never refill the entire time we were there.  The sweets were very sad."}
{"text":"First time here. I stopped in on july 22 as an accident but I thought, \"Ok, why not\" I was leary from all the bad reviews I seen on Yelp but thought I was in a different place when I walked into the door and saw the buffett and the dining area.....It was NOTHING like the reviews. I think the people who gave it a poor rating are either VERY miserable and picky or competitors who try to sabotage this place. Place was sooooooooo clean and big not feeling cramped... Waitress was pretty friendly who smiled frequently and more friendly than most other places I been to who seemed to look miserable or just hate their life and bitter they had to do their job. But thats typical for the area....Anyway, food was really good. Sweet and sour fried fish was DELISHIOUS!. The grilled mushrooms were awesome and as good as anywhere if not better. My only complaint were the spring rolls which seemed to have kind of mushed dark brown meat spread in it instead of cabbage and veggies.. Spring rolls are supposed to be light and airy but instead were a little heavy and dense with some mushed mystery meat...That was gross but other stuff there was pretty good. Baby broiled shrimp and veggies were good too. I came with a freind and she said the beef ribs were also really good. This is probably one of the cleanest places I been to with the friendliest wait staff I experinced from about 5 different Chinese buffets in the area I been too. Its a bit higher than the rest but a real good experience in terms of atmosphere to the actual food. Dont listen to the other people who have NO CLUE about Chinese buffets and act like chronic complainers and just like to whine about anything and everything. This place is good and u wont be dissapointed"}
{"text":"This buffet has since changed its name from Lin's to New York Seafood Buffet. Same owner, new chef, and I think better food.  I'm glad I did not read any of the reviews before coming here because otherwise I think I would have missed a wonderful dining experience.  As you know, most Chinese buffet places are not that clean and I was surprised by how clean, well decorated, spacious the restaurant was.  Everything just felt clean. This in itself should deserve 5 stars!!! The choices were abundant. Most of the food was fresh. We came on the tail end of the lunch crowd so some of the items like the egg custard tart and Seasame balls were a bit dried from being under the heat lamp for too long. And some of the food like the miso soup and beef & broccoli were a bit flavorless.  On the positive side, the sushi was plentiful and fresh, with not too much rice underneath. And they did have chicken feet and braised pig's feet.  Overall, enjoyable and deserving of my 4 star rating!!!"}
{"text":"Just visited this place for the first time, and wow it was amazing!! The food was spectacular. It was fresh and delicious. I recommend everyone to go try it out."}
{"text":"Mediocre. Cold food that should be hot. Poor flavors. Only went because of a work thing. Would NOT recommend. I can see why they got 11 health violations in May 2016."}
{"text":"Pro's - clean, friendly, fast Con's - the food  Not one bit different from its former name. blek. Was hoping for a miracle, did not get one. will not be back.  Next time, I'll continue on Bell Rd down to Pacific Seafood Buffet. Much better choice!"}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin. I should have guessed from the empty dining area that this experience was going to leave much to be desired. Saturday afternoon, you'd expect a good restaurant to have hungry customers enjoying themselves. Not in this case. It was a ghost town in there, no doubt because this place has the WORST food ever!! This place is also known as New York Seafood Buffet located on Bell road. There is nothing New York about this place. There is a wide variety of food, but more doesn't always mean better. And in this case, more definitely means horrific. The jalapeno chicken taste like they poured Karo corn syrup on the chicken and poured a ton of black pepper all over it. Sickeningly sweet. The \"shell delight\" was more like shell disaster. The oyster shell had some type of strange mixture covered with cheese. I don't know who is back there cooking, but they really need to stop. Maybe this was an attempt at creativity. Complete failure. The egg rolls were the worst I've ever tasted. I bit into it and immediately had to spit it out. I'm use to egg rolls with cabbage, other vegetables, and meat (chicken or pork or beef). This egg roll had NO vegetables and NO meat of any kind. It was filled with a stuffing type mixture. I asked the server to tell me what the mixture was. I told her that I was used to egg rolls with vegetables. She said, \"That's vegetables.\" I picked up the stove top stuffing that was in the egg roll and said, \"THIS is not vegetables. Can you see this? It's stuffing\" (I have a photo). She looked at it. Her face agreed with me, but she didn't want to admit it. She finally said, \"the egg rolls are usually made with vegetables and meat.\" I said, \"What? Did they run out of vegetables today?\" Absolutely disgusting. Then there were the random meat balls on a stick--which were fashioned on a skewer one meatball on each end of the stick. A peculiar miniature meatball bar bell.  It tasted as strange as it looked. The texture was suspiciously odd. I truly doubt it was beef. I'm afraid to think WHAT that meat was, really. The sweet and sour fish was a blob of sweet mush with no flavor of fish and the \"vegetable mien fun\" was no fun at all. I couldn't get out of that place fast enough. For $10.40  I could have gone to Panda Express and had a really good lunch. Instead, I took a chance and entered the House of Churning Stomach. If you are looking for syrupy sweet  meats and slop covered with cheese, and egg rolls made of cold stuffing--you have found the right place. If you prefer food that is edible, do not stop. Do not pass go. Go directly to Panda Express. Consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"This place was the best buffet around until it went under new ownership a few months back.   Its currently disgusting"}
{"text":"For those who don't know it , this originally was named \"hibachi Grill buffet\" , they changed their name because they had so many bad reviews. And I will tell you that nothing has changed here. It is the same company , different buffet name , a pig with a new frock on. Save your time and money. Seriously. I'm not joking , i'm not playing here. Food is dried out, there isn't a good selection of actual \"seafood\". The sushi is  cooked fish , but thank god for that , because if it was real and raw sushi people would be going to the hospital (thunderbird samaritan is right down the road for those brave enough to eat here). My point is , if they can't even prepare the existing food correctly , how on earth would they be able to handle real sushi? Good waiter service , but bad food."}
{"text":"By far one of the worse buffet I have ever been to. They barely keep their food supplied and the worse of all, I found a piece of hair, yes I said it a HAIR! I found a piece of hair in the self served ice cream station. That station is so unprotected that I'm not surprised a piece of hair fell in. But just the thought of another random stranger's hair in there is just plain NASTY!!! I even tried to talk to the manager but it took literally 15mins. Before the manager came."}
{"text":"We're rating a Chinese buffet, right? One star to me would equal insects crawling around, poor selection, and bad service. This place is clean all around, one of the bigger selections in the area, and the people working here are friendly and attentive. The food was great for a Chinese buffet. Give it a shot. If you want fancy Chinese, then don't go to a buffet...."}
{"text":"Real rating is negative 5 stars, not much of a selection as per commercials lead you to believe. Staff was very rude when we asked for a manager which was not available. Made rude comments speaking Chinese, fortunately my wife is Japanese and heard every word they said, will be reporting them to the BBB for rude and unprofessional behaviour."}
{"text":"BAD FOOD!  Save your time and money, don't go there!  It's was my Dad's idea.  He's likes to give new restaurants a try so I went to read some reviews on Yelp, not so much positive about the place.  I told my Parents about these negative reviews & asked them not to go there but they wouldn't listen to me.  I finally gave in to my Dad and went there with them last night Friday, 7/5/13 for dinner.  Dinner price is  $13.99 per adult.  The restaurant gives my parents $2.00 off senior discount, big deal.  The ambient of the restaurant is nice, restrooms are clean, our waiter was courteous & friendly by frequently checking on us and promptly cleared out our empty dishes on our table (no complaint here).  Food tasted a little strange but was ok to me.  My Dad seems to enjoy his choice of selection of variety on the buffet.  We left Lin's Seafood Buffet about 7:30  P. M. went home ... and about 10:30 P.M. last night I had a violent stomachache!  I was having diarrhea and still now this morning.  Everything I ate at the restaurant has been threw up. I took 2 table spoons Pepto-Bismo (the pink liquid stomach relief) but couldn't be able to keep it down, I was threw it all up again.  I was on the toilet all night and vomiting 7 times!  ... until my stomach was completely empty.  I kept a double plastic clean trash bags next to my bed in case I want to vomit again.  I couldn't keep my Pepto-Bismo in my system, I threw up back out as soon as I took The Pepto-Bismo and water.  It was horrible!  I was sick like a...can't even find a word to describe my situation I'm in right now.  My mind is scatter and cannot concentrating in anything.  I feel dizzy every time I get up from my bed to use the restroom.   All I want to say is I don't want anyone to get sick like me.   Fortunately, my parents seem to be ok.  We have narrowed it down to a few items on the buffet and found that could be the thin slice beef at the  Mongolian stir fry bar, the clams, the seaweed at the sushi bar and definitely the oysters.  These are items I've tried last night but not my parents.   I will never go back to Lin's Seafood Buffet ever again even if they give the food out for free.  For being sick like this, it's horrible.   Don't go there!  Don't make the same mistake as I did by letting my Dad persuades me and disregard these negative reviews on Yelp or you may try this place at your own risk, you decide."}
{"text":"I wish I had read the reviews before coming here. Most of the food we tried was hard and cold. The hibachi grill really doesn't have much options as far as veggies are concerned. The sushi selection was good but the sushi were all falling apart maybe from sitting there too long.... It was our first time here after the new management and I don't know what made us think it would be an improvement. The women's restroom I will say was stocked and clean... The waiter we had was very nice.... The food was gross. We were very disappointed thankfully a group of ladies next to us gave us a coupon so we were paying full price for not even eating... We won't be coming back. The upside none of us got sick..."}
