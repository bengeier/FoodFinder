{"text":"After living in Texas for almost 4 years, I have to say it doesn't get much more authentic. Food is excellent, portion size is very generous, and being that this is their 3rd location I'd say they have it pretty well figured out.   We've been there on three occasions and the food has been just as good each time. Only reason they didn't get 5 stars was the pitcher of margaritas that we shared was a little weak.   I'd recommend them as the best Mexican in Lake County. I've had the rest and the closest is El Charitto in Wickliffe, but never been as good as this."}
{"text":"Average Mexican joint most times, last visit was disappointing.  Chips were crazy stale and no one came back to let them know. $2 for a soda is a bit pricey for this type of place. Had the pollo encremado which is grilled chicken in a sour cream sauce with onions and mushrooms. Asked for guacamole which isn't included with the $10 meal and that added another $3 and the guac had way too many onions in it.   I don't think I will go back, El Palenque on Vine is way better."}
{"text":"I'm still looking for truly great Mexican food in the Cleveland area. This doesn't seem to be it, though I did, overall, enjoy my experience. The waiter informed us that the ranch that came with the chips and salsa was \"Mexican ranch.\" I have a ranch problem and this stuff tasted pretty good, authenticity be danged. The salsa was nothing special but it did taste like salsa and we ate it happily. Pitchers of margaritas were 5 dollars off so we a pitcher on the rocks. It arrived frozen but it still tasted good and was strong enough for us. Definitely not the best margarita I've ever had, but shared among friends on a friday night at a discount, it gave me little to complain about. My vegetarian combination platter was fine- LOTS of cheese. I probably wouldn't order it again and I'd recommend avoiding the chile relleno. I liked the rice. The refried beans left much to be desired. I didn't taste them but my friend had chicken fajitas and they looked and smelled pretty great, with lots of chicken. She seemed pretty happy with them. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here unless somebody I liked wanted to meet up, but based on my one experience with this restaurant, I also wouldn't say no to returning."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 2 is because of the AYCE taco's on Tuesdays.  The tacos are good, not great, but how can you pass on AYCE taco's...I had ten, and between my table of four, we had 43. And I think it was only $6.99 or $7.99 for an order.  Otherwise the food is average at best, but it could be worse. I have been satisfied both times I have gone, and I'm sure I'll be back in the future because it's so close to home."}
{"text":"GOOD FOOD BUT CRUMMY SERVICE. This is food for the regular citizens, as real hardcore Mwxican fare will not go over well in Eastlake. If you want real, authentic , Hardcore, go to LaMexicana in Painseville. I want the waitresses back as the waiters do not care about the customers. I did not get a napkin and the table was streaked with a dirty towel. I ordered the Tuesday taco special which was quite tasty, but I waited for my third plate of tacos, ( 3 to a plate) and waited for a half hour until leaving without my tacos. I left no tip for being ignored. I'll give it one more try, but that is all. They all know English, but not how to wait on American customers."}
{"text":"Food and service was horrible. Started off with dry burnt chips with mushy watery salsa. I had mushy tasteless beef on my tacos with lettuces that must have been sitting in rotten old water because it looked fresh n green but was nasty. Our waiter spent over 25 min talking to the lady at another table when he finally came over and seen I did not eat my food but a  bite from one taco and asked if everything OK I said no it was not and he took my plate. When the bill came and my order was still on it I was not happy. My husband went to cash out and said I was not happy with my food but will pay for the one I bite.. The waiter came over and said I didn't tell him clear enough I didn't like it.. Well not eating n saying I didn't like it apparently was not clear enough I think I was supposed to throw my plate on the floor and start yelling.. Not sure! They did take off 2 of the 3 tacos. Just gross I think the only reason ppl go is for the cheep drinks. BTW my husbands lettuce was bad too however he just moved it it was not directly on his food..... He did tell the waiter when he came to the table but wasn't gonna make a big deal cuz it really didn't matter cuz he wasn't gonna eat it. Idk"}
{"text":"I've been here twice; I enjoyed myself both times and my friend didn't voice any complaints either. It's okay food and the prices are reasonable. I would definitely suggest it to someone."}
{"text":"This was kind of a neat find for me, personally. Well at first. I've been to a sister restaurant about 90 miles away several times since the day it opened over a decade ago. Same signage, same exact menu.....    Pros:   Food comes out fast.  Menu is extensive.  Guac is good.   Queso Dip is good.  Ridiculously large portions    Cons:  There's nothing Mexican about the staff or the feel here. Not like in Salem, OH.   Waitress was not very attentive at all.  The quality of the entrees was a subpar. The dishes seemed \"right\" but not right...like maybe I got someone's leftovers reheated.   All in all, though, if you are hungry and want the kind of Mexican food that will stick to your ribs and make you feel horrible about your life choices....this might be hte place for you.  If you want a actual good meal and want to feel like you are getting even a smidge of Mexican culture......don't."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff with a variety of Mexican food. We go for the large frozen margaritas which are buy one get one for a penny on Wednesdays--muy delicioso! An eclectic setting but the staff are very responsive, quick to take orders, and the food comes sizzling hot."}
{"text":"I would only go to sit on the patio if I ever returned and hopefully have a better tasting margarita than last time w/ chips and salsa. The lime on the rocks marg was ehhh tasted mostly like mix. I ordered a combination dinner along with my husband who had the same view on the food as I, which was the beef was very tomato tasting; like Italian Mexican food, weird. The service was great nice people bummer about the food. I hate to keep on going, but I gotta say.... What's up with the house sauce they serve with the chips and salsa. I had to ask the server about it. I guess it's a mayo based dip. But what I feel is that the sauce is wasted more than consumed."}
{"text":"Keep in mind, I give a lot of allowances for Mexican restaurants...different strokes, different folks... but... First...took a long time to get our drink order taken. My husband started the stop watch on his phone and wanted to leave. Second...while eating my first bit of salsa, I was wondering what was wrong with it. Realized it tasted more like pizza sauce than salsa. Bleah. Third...got my order wrong.  Fourth...the enchilada sauce was far too mild. I'm not wanting hot hot spicy dishes, but there needs to be some kick. This was more like tomato sauce. Bleah. Fifth...I'm not going to complain to the waiter because I just heard the waitress say the word 'punta'...and I'm pretty dang sure that's inappropriate workplace language. Sixth...lest you think nothing was good, the rice and beans were good. I was very happy with those. Seventh...I'm not from this area, and I hate leaving negative reviews, but... If you're a fellow traveler, don't stop here. Really. Don't."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican place in the area! They have great food, prices, and the service is usually above average! They bring 2 salsas, I don't care for the white salsa, but it's a nice variety! They have great drink specials! Since I found this place, this is the only Mexican place I will eat at while in town!"}
{"text":"We go here about once a month for the AYCE tacos.  A couple of the servers know who we are by now, and we always get great service.  Each server has his or her own personality, from mild to wild, but they have never been anything but friendly and polite.  Unlike another review claimed, the tortilla chips always come hot and fresh, and their salsa is great.  They've also got a few good HOT sauces if you ask.  As for their ranch sauce, it tastes good, even if it's a little out of place.   I absolutely LOVE their beef tacos, and it seems almost every night we go we end up in an eating contest.  After the night I ate 15 in about an hour, they've started bringing me plates of 6 instead of 3.  They also let us take our extras home, which is cool.  The only reason I'm not giving it a perfect score is because I've never tried anything else on the menu.  If the rest of the menu is as good as the AYCE, it'd be a 5 star rating all the way!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better Mexican Restaurants in town. They have great staff and unlimited chips salsa. They did just ad a deck which is nice to have drink and cigar. There driveway does need some work its like war zone a little bit. The have tiny bar and need more vodka. The food has always been wonderful ."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time about a week after it opened. The service was just abysmal. The food mediocre.  Because they were so new I decided to give them another chance. About a month later I went back to see if things had improved.  The service was better but still lacking. I ordered the California burrito. It was actually pretty good. So, I left the place an open option.    Now, I just returned from my third visit with the impetus to write this review. Service was OK this time. But, two thirds of the way into my California burrito I pulled a soggy piece of bar-code sticker tape out of my mouth. It looked like the kind used to tape shut bags of vegetables. I couldn't say for sure if I swallowed any of it. I was pretty repulsed.  I opted to just pay my bill and leave. I was queasy and I just wanted to get out of there.  Also, something didn't smell quite right in my iced tea. I'm not sure if it was the ice, the glass or the tea itself. I didn't notice it until the server brought out a refill.  My advice is to just stay away. When they fail maybe someone will open something nice there."}
{"text":"New Mexican restaurant that just opened this past weekend. Describing it as A-OK would be a pretty accurate description.   The food was just okay but not amazing, margarita not great, salsa was so-so. Service was slow but I blame that on this being their second night open. Our server was friendly, but clearly stressed.   It was never a very attractive restaurant (in it's previous restaurant lives) and the new lime and yellow walls didn't really help with that situation. Oh well.  It's so close that I'm quite sure we'll be back. Hopefully this is a place that can grow on me?"}
{"text":"My hubby and I checked this place out after voting.  It was....a little strange.  We walked in and saw we had happened to show up on unlimited tacos for 6.99 night.  Score!  However, then the waitress came and brought us chips and salsa....and ranch?....oh Eastlake.  You little scoundrel.  Anyway, we laughed it off, but were more puzzled when our waitress brought an additional bowl of chips when we hadnt ordered any.  Anyway, we both went with tacos, and were moderately disappointed.  They were okay, but pretty bland, basically meat and lettuce in a shell.  I mean, for the price point, the tacos being slimmed down makes sense, but they were pretty flavorless, which I don't think is okay.  I don't know.  I ordered a margarita, which was good, and the staff was nice.  I would give this place another chance and try something else, but I was pretty underwhelmed, as was my husband."}
{"text":"How do you screw up Mexican food? The parking lot at this place is always full, so we thought, why not try it? has to be good. wrong, so wrong. When we were seated they brought tortilla chips, salsa, and some sort of ranch dip to the table. RANCH? This isn't applebee's. It's supposed to be Mexican. Strike one. The chips weren't warm and freshly made as I am used to. Strike two. Tasted the salsa, which looked more like marinara btw, and that was strike 3. It was bland and pureed to death. How do you screw up salsa?   I knew I was in trouble if the chips and salsa were bad. I had a classic margarita and chicken fajitas. Margarita was awful...momocho in ohio city makes the best around here, I think. The Jalisco margarita wasn't even in the same playing field....strike 4. Now, onto the chicken fajitas. They might as well have called them Bell pepper and onion fajitas because there was hardly any chicken on my hot plate. Not only that, it was bland bland bland. Tasted like they only added a little salt and pepper, and perhaps had let them sit on that very hot plate to cook down.   The only thing good in my dish was the sour cream. Once again, the east side is a major disappointment. They make their attempts, but I think overall they are half-ass jobs. No wonder the east isn't a destination spot. We still have no place to eat out here."}
{"text":"First, the food was pretty good. I had vegetable fajita. I asked for and received some corn  tortillas in addition to the flour tortillas. My family members had chicken burritos and tacos. They were good there and as leftovers. They also served great corn chips with both a homemade red salsa and a spicy white salsa.  Excellent.  BTW after noticing other reviews, you do not have to eat the white salsa if you do not like it.   Most of the staff was  genuinely nice.  When it came to settling the bill however there was a problem.  A lady came of nowhere to announce she did not want to honor the Entertainment coupon in addition to the two dollar beer special. It was clear we could not use our coupon with a food special. However it was unclear and uncustomary to refuse the drink special at the same time. Besides we asked about the specials on beverages and no exclusions for coupons were mentioned. The sign outdoors said two dollar bottled beer. To be rated well a restaurant has to be hospitable. The lady who sounded like a manager was argumentative and inhospitable. She took a customer is always wrong stance.   She stated that if I told the truth on Yelp she would state that my comment was unfair.  I do have sympathy for small independent business.  I hope they learn and realize they should not  spoil the experience for the customers."}
{"text":"Does not honor their own coupons from entertainment book And brings glasses overflowing sticky and messy Had to ask for towels so I could wipe up mess myself Let you know how the food tastes when I'm done"}
{"text":"Every Tuesday is all you can eat tacos for 6.99 The food is fresh and authentic and the staff are warm and friendly This place is great"}
{"text":"Not bad! They offer a variety of foods, typical at any Mexican place. Nothing extra special. Beans and red sauce are a little more runny than preferred and I wish the burritos were topped with a queso sauce rather than shredded cheese. They need some extra love in their food! A little pricey but not super expensive. It's a cute place and I may go back again."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for a quick Mexican fix the other day. Service was fast and their pricing was right. They brought the regular chips and salsa and then some sour cream ranch tasting dip. It was good but I preferred the salsa. I had the chicken enchiladas supreme, they were good but not over the top. He had the California burrito, it was HUGE, for $9.75 it took up the entire oblong plate. He said it was amazing. Topped it off with a 32oz dos Equis for $5 and I had a margarita on the rocks, not bad. Overall It was good but the other Mexican spots in the area have it beat."}
{"text":"Tonight was  my first and last experience at Jalisco. The order was incorrect, the food was mediocre at best, the service super slow and no crayons for the kids. I'll stick to El Rodeo in Mentor."}
{"text":"Once very good.  Last visit we got burned shells and bland food. Might have been because it was Margarita night, but service was awful."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon and everything was 5 stars! The excellent service, an attentive waiter, wonderful food! The waiter refilled our drinks, gave us another basket of chips, was friendly and the food was fresh and great. I had gotten the Quesadilla de fajita camarones. Others in my party were well-impressed too (altho surprised that the pork was whole, like a roast, rather than shredded). Was so happy.  Sunday eve and everything was 1 star! The service was non-existant, the waitress seemed like she didn't care at all, never refilled our drinks, no more chips, and the food was subpar.  I had gotten the enchilladas acapulco and there was hardly any shrimp and everything was swimming in the red sauce. We had to ask another waiter for boxes and our bill. Others in my party didn't even want to take their leftovers home. Was so sad. Am willing to give them another chance only because the first time was so exceptional."}
{"text":"Tried this Tuesday (All you can eat tacos) food was indeed very bland even salsa had no kick at all. The margarita was good but really just like every other average margarita. But for $6.99 all you can eat I guess the tacos could have been worse. Service was good."}
{"text":"Jalisco must be the Spanish word for \"bland.\" Everything about this place fits the description. Menu is just the usual tacos, burritos, etc. None of them have any flavor. Even the salsa for the chips is tasteless.  The big attraction the evening we went was 2-for-1 margaritas, but those were meh as well.   There was a big crowd -- whether because of the margarita specials or because there was a local festival next door, I don't know -- and the woman taking names had no clue how to handle it. She kept telling everyone there would be a \"10 to 15 minute wait\" even as the lobby filled up (only three chairs) and the crowd spilled over into the parking lot.   Her system was high-tech: Note cards with numbers scrawled on them that she handed out. But then she called the numbers out of order.  If you're hungry for Mexican in the neighborhood, Jalapeno Loco in Points East is a far, far better choice. That menu has the usual plus some alternatives, and the dishes have much more pronounced flavors."}
