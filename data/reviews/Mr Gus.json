{"text":"Horrible experience. The food was awful but tolerable compared to the service. We will definitely not be going back."}
{"text":"Ordered wings and fries....Let's say I was disappointed to see the cook (nice young lady), but she was stabbing the wings with a knife while cooking now if you don't know how long wings are to cook without stabbing them you should not be cooking.    Everyone knows when you stabb something as small as a wing you have just fried the heck out of the meat and sure enough the wings were hard all the way through. The fries were awesome! A cook is needed...."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Under new management so I want to give them the benefit of doubt. Greek and Mexican in one place. Can we say confused? Nice staff."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with my order. I ordered a chicken quesadilla. It didn't look or taste like any quesadilla I've ever had. It was edible but not tasty or satisfying. I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Saturday night. Ordered a Philly cheesesteak- it was bland and didn't like the lettuce used, guest had a cheeseburger he complained about the taste of lettuce. I said I'll give them another try, ordered some plain wing tonight with onion rings. No flavor or taste. So I'm pretty much done with trying. Food is a little too bland for my taste. Going to bed a lil hungry tonight. Customer Service is great and place is clean and never crowded so I'll rate a 3. Not the typical Greek Restaurant where flavors flow."}
{"text":"Ordered wings, just as I did before the new ownership. I went once after owners changed and the wings were the same as before. Today, the sauce was watered down, the wings weren't good and the price increased from $8.45 to $11.45. I won't be going back.  The 1 star is for the pleasant lady working the register/phone."}
{"text":"When they got new owners and told me they were going to be serving Spanish food I was so excited and omg the tacos were soooo good we would go once or two times a week but then all of the sudden the quality of food just became extremely poor and no longer fresh last time we went i got sick"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Food was ok. Probably won't make another visit. Greek & Mexican just don't mix. I really didn't know what to get."}
{"text":"I love this place. We often pick up from here. We love their gyros, greek salads, and hummus."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the attention first, the place is very clean, I'll come back soon"}
