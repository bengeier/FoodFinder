{"text":"Overall the pizza was very good, the marinara sauce tasted fresh and wasn't too watery. The caesar salad wasn't tossed properly and had a little bit too much garlic for my taste. However my girlfriend really enjoyed it. Great prices!"}
{"text":"Tired this restaurant with Groupon $40 (paid 50% off for coupon).  It is way better than I thought.  The restaurant is right beside the fancy food court in Yorkdale Shopping centre.  The atmosphere is cosy like family style.  The price is reasonable and it tastes pretty good.  The pizza is \"juicy\", not too dried on the crust, but the olive in the pizza is quite salty.  Tomato bisque is a must-try.  Nepoli salad is not bad but pricy.  I would recommend my friends to have a try."}
{"text":"I like this place and would go back!  Their ordering system is different, but servers were nice and friendly, and walk us thru the steps.  Not hard to follow at all.  Probably cause we were there on fri night after the dinner rush.    It was a great place to chill after some shopping!  Here's what the two of us shared - both came fast and fresh!!!  Formaggio fritto Flame-fried kefalograviera (sheep's milk cheese) on a bed of arugula, roasted red peppers, olives, and capers with a  lemon olive oil vinaigrette.  Don Andreas Pizza Creme fraiche, fior-di-latte, roasted chicken.  Baked, then topped with a house-made chipotle corn salsa, sliced avocado, and a lime wedge.  I had their \"authentic tiramisu\" for dessert, it is among the best tiramisu in toronto, but still can't compare to the tiramisu I had in italy!!!  Nice espresso as well."}
{"text":"I've been to Famoso more then a couple times now and can safely say the food is good. A lot better then expected for a mall restaurant. The pizzas are more then enough to fill you up, but I would say they're just okay not anything amazing. I usually get the prosciutto arugula pizza and am always pleased with it though. The roasted red pepper soup is good and sandwiches also taste pretty decent. There is a varied dessert and drink menu to fit all kinds of taste buds as well.   However, a big gripe that I have with Famoso Yorkdale is their service. Service was great when they first opened but seems like they've continued to go downhill since then. It's an odd setup they have where you write down and get up to place your own food/drink order to \"set up your tab\". I think they should just change this to a full on service where the servers take your order at the table from the beginning."}
{"text":"I love coming here! We always get the same items when we go; the black olives with feta (my fav), the napoli salad (super healthy with chick peas) and the cappricosa pizza, which is just killer! Service is great and very attentive, food is always good! Can't wait to follow up a review with the nutella pizza. Good times!"}
{"text":"Really weird ordering system, that noone really explains.  we (2 adults and toddler) were seated at a 2 ppl small square table where besides us there was a large table in the corner where some friend of staff was sitting and texting on her phone. Poor and slow service. We ordered Primavera pizza and mozzarella balls wrapped in prosciutto. The latter was quite good, the pizza came burnt. We were told that this is the way it's supposed to be, but I'm sorry, I don't believe we should be tasting ashes let aside that ashes fall off dough in small pieces. We were made another one (it wasn't very nice to wait with our toddler) it was still somewhat burnt, but least eatable.  We got 3 kinds of gelato all of which were disgusting and chemically. I guess because we make real gelatos and ice creams at home from REAL stuff we know what it supposed to taste.  Waste of time and money (the prices are quite high). Never again. All of the stuff (bakers and servers) were very young, that might explain the issues, there simply no adult to supervise them and they themselves don't really care."}
{"text":"The tomato bisque is very good...you have try it!!  The ambiance makes me feel like we are in Napoli."}
{"text":"Went there today and they were permanently closed. Another restaurant is moving in. Too bad since I only got to enjoy it once."}
{"text":"It doesn't taste that good especially with the price that they charge. It's to expensive for no reason.Not Surprised that it's permanently closed."}
{"text":"I am not quite sure how to review this restaurant, as I just found the overall experience slightly odd.  It's located inside Yorkdale food court, but has it's own seating, waitstaff, etc.  When you walk in there is a sign telling you to seat yourself, and take your order to the cash register.  We seated ourselves and looked over the menu.  If you have questions, it's hard to ask someone as there are no waitstaff assigned to your table.  Eventually someone came by to ask if we were planning to order or still deciding.  You write down your order on a pad of paper and then bring it up to the cash.  You have to indicate your table number, and exactly what you want to order.  Then you place your order, but you don't pay.  Waitstaff will deliver your food and drinks to your table.  We ordered two different kinds of pizza and the beer of the day which was the tankhouse.  Both pizzas were okay tasting, but very soggy in the centre.  Instead of placing the pizzas on a plate it might be a good idea to have a breathable plate that will prevent it from getting so soggy.  The white sauce pizza had garlic butter on it, which was dripping everywhere which was a bit much for me.  Both pizzas were okay, but it's not likely I would return.  The set up is strange, and there are no bathrooms in the restaurant, so you will have to exit the restaurant and use the food court bathrooms which is also a strange experience."}
{"text":"Went to famosos for lunch while shopping at Yorkdale today. We had the \"Italian Ham & Pineapple Pizza\".  To start, this pizza was decent but nothing to go home and tell your parents about.  The dough of the pizza was thin crust, and it was crispy on the first few bites. However, the pizza quickly fell flat and became quite soggy. Another complaint that I have about this pizza is that I personally enjoy my pizzas with a sizable portion of toppings.  If you're looking for a filling and rich pizza, you're not going to find it here. The pizza was very light in size and flavour. The ingredients just felt like they were too spaced out, and the overall experience of eating this pizza was reflected in the decor - bland and boring.  Overall, I think that there are plenty of good places to eat in the newly renovated Yorkdale food court, and this is not one of them."}
{"text":"I had been a frequent visitor of the Edmonton Famoso locations at WEM, Jasper Avenue and North Edmonton.  So this was just more of a curiosity on how this location was run.    I was shocked to see the potato white pizza to be off the menu.  I was also shocked to see that the gorgonzola walnut salad was charged extra.  It was actually part of the meal at the Edmonton locations.    The pizzas were quite consistent at all the Edmonton locations.  The salad lacked a bit of bite and the piece of bread didn't have much of a taste as I'm used to a bit more garlic.  The Siciliana pizza wasn't too bad and reminded me of what I ordered before.  I usually would order the Vesuvio pizza.    I would go back for a quick pizza but it's kind of hard to compare when the area is predominantly Italian and generally their pizza is good.  I hope Famoso does survive in Toronto as it is just another option for wood-oven Napolitano pizza."}
{"text":"Best spot in the food court, for sure! Amazing selection of artisan pizzas. Seasonal pizzas, traditional, and some funky ones too. Pizzas are about $10-15 each but well worth it because you get an entire pizza! So yummy. Definitely my favourite spot in the mall!"}
{"text":"Went to Famosa in the Yorkdale Mall  for lunch earlier this week when I was in Toronto. It was a cold and windy day, the mall was packed with people but there was no line in the restaurant.   We ordered couple of pizzas and a caprese salad to share among 3 adults and 2 kids. We asked the waitress for a couple more pieces of flat bread for the capresse salad but she said bread was $1 for 3 pcs. The salad was $13 and they want another $1 for 3 small pcs of flat bread, seriously!? The salad was under seasoned and did not worth the money to begin with.  The pizzas were okay but just average, There were no wow's You can get pizzas like these almost anyway. The restaurant concept is also a little strange. You line up to place order and the servers bring the food to your table just like a regular restaurant. Since it is not truly full service, I don't think they deserve the normal 15% to 18% tip."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised by Famoso. Essentially, it's a very good pizza restaurant that happens to be located in a mall.   It's not the best Pizza in Toronto -- maybe not even in the top five. I would definitely choose Libretto and Queen Margherita over it, and there are probably others that would beat it as well. That said, it's definitely very good Pizza, better than almost any fast-food chain or any restaurant that doesn't focus entirely on pizza.   It's also not the sort of place I'd choose for a long relaxing meal with friends -- it's not quite as hip, the drinks aren't as nice as a place like Queen Margherita. It's well above average, and better than almost any restaurant I've visited in a mall, but the ambience isn't quite top-notch (although I do like their light fixtures).  Service was quick, and the owner was present when we visited, stopped in to see how we were doing. They seemed a little understaffed, so we didn't get as much attention as I might choose from the waitstaff, but the attention we did get was solid.  Basically, unless you live near a really great pizza place, or don't like this style of Pizza, this is probably going to be one of the better pizzas you've had. If you're at Yorkdale and you need a meal, and you're not looking for something very cheap and very fast, this is definitely my top pick of the places I've visited here."}
{"text":"My husband and I were here for lunch recently.  It is located in the Yorkdale Shopping Centre within the Dine on 3 food court (but it is a sit-down restaurant).    This place was so busy.  We had to wait for a table and as soon as a table cleared up, the host told us to go to the take-out counter and place our orders there and tell them what table number we were at and then sit down and they would bring our order to us.  The atmosphere was a bit hectic, but they were pretty efficient.  We were hungry and looking for some mid-shopping food, not a leisurely lunch, so we didn't mind.  Our server came over and introduced herself and acknowledged that we had ordered at the take-out counter and informed us that she would bring out our orders when they were done.  In the meantime, she could take our drinks order if we wanted anything.  I just had water, but my husband had a beer.  We had the lunch special ($10 for a pizzetta (small pizza) and a soup or salad).  I had the Margherita pizzetta with the Napoli salad, and my husband had the Margherita pizzetta with the fire-roasted tomato bisque.  The Margherita pizzetta had tomato sauce, mozzarella and romano cheese, and basil.  It was a good size for lunch (not too small).  The crust was thin and blistery, although some parts were a little burnt.  Very good Neapolitan-style pizza.  The Napoli salad was great.  It was real mixed greens (not iceberg or romaine), and had carrots, tomatoes, onions and chickpeas and came with a balsamic vinaigrette (which I had asked for on the side - and it actually did come on the side, hurray!).  I had a taste of the tomato bisque, it was creamy and rich and full of tomato flavour.  Service was good.  The server checked up on us throughout the meal, re-filled my water, and brought us our bill when we were done.  Lunch time at the Dine on 3 food court is super busy, so if you don't feel like circling the food court like a vulture waiting for a seat to open up, you can mosey on over to Famoso and they'll find a seat for you.    FYI: The lunch special is valid until 5pm."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Reasonable prices. Confusing ordering system for first timers. These 3 points summarizes this place pretty well.  The first thing people will probably notice about Famoso is why can't they just have a full service system? Why am I seated and then have to go to the counter to place my order? I don't see a benefit, but this is also not a big deal. It just might be confusing to some people. Our server did explain this to us so I guess it's ok.  I LOVE the pizza here. It's my second time. I had cavoletti and funghi this time. The thinness of the pizza and the fresh toppings make it really tasty. I'm too used to eating Pizza Pizza because it seems like everyone gets PP for events due to their cheap price. This is miles above PP. The best part for me is that Famoso has some unique pizzas not offered by other places I've tried. Pepperoni, Hawaiian, deluxe now look really boring.   Of course, prices are correspondingly more expensive too. But I think it's worth it. Speaking about prices, when you pay, you're supposed to ask your server for it. After having to order from the counter, I thought it'd make sense to pay at the counter too. I went up. They told me, but they let me pay at the counter anyways.   All in all, it's a good experience. If you're sick of Pizza Pizza and want something more delicately delicious, come here."}
{"text":"I have been to Famoso twice now and both times the pizza was absolutely delicious!  I love the thin crust and it has the perfect amount of toppings.  It is seriously the best pizza I have had outside of Italy!   On top of the great tasting pizza, the service is great!  They are very attentive and even the manager of the restaurant comes around to welcome people.  It's unfortunate that it is not busier.  The prices are very reasonable and it doesn't take too long for the pizza to be made.    One cool thing about this restaurant is the way you order.  You choose what you would like from the menu and write it down on a pad of paper and hand it in.  I think this is genius because you can order quickly, or you can take your time - it's up to you.  I definitely plan on returning here again.  I haven't tried the desserts but they sound pretty amazing."}
{"text":"The concept of this restaurant is too confusing.  Wait to be seated, then sit down, then get up to order at the counter, then you get full service. Why not just give full from start to finish?  The pizza is way too expensive for what it is.  Especially when it looks like it could be a kids restaurant. Not worth another try at those prices."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE I AM IN LOVE WITH FAMOSO AT YORKDALE!!!  I've been there 3-4 times already and they just impress me more and more Delicious pizza!!!! Delicious hot drinks!! Great sangria!! DELICIOUS NUTELLA BANANA PIZZA DESERT (I think it was) and dolce banana mmmmmm Great staff as well! Thanks guys for a great night last night!  Keep it up and never change!!!!"}
{"text":"About Dinner Last Night 1 Sweet BBQ Chicken New York Pizza  1 Margherita Pizza 3.5/5 The Flavor was there but the Dough was to Toasty and the Toppings fell off the Pizza! BUT The Dessert was on Point! Nutella Banana Pizza! 5/5 I enjoyed myself!"}
{"text":"Food's good, service is good.  Food: We split a caprese salad and a cappriciosa pizza. The tomatoes and mozzarella were both cold so the tomatoes were a little mealy and the cheese was stiff, not soft. The pizza itself was fine, w/ the crust a little soggy in the center, but not a fall apart mess like QMP, and chewy throughout. I would've preferred more charring on the crust.  Service: It's not a full service restaurant, which, for the prices they charge, it should be. You write your order down and bring it to the order counter, then they bring out the food. The food was brought out pretty quickly, and the waitstaff was attentive, but again, it's not a big deal to have them come around and take your order."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  I somehow stumbled to Yorkdale for the first time in at least 2-3 years (at least way before Dine on 3 opened) today. I was craving pizza at the same time, so I decided to come here for lunch.  At first I was overwhelmed by the prices, but them I looked at the lunch special and pizzettas, and those prices were a lot more reasonable. I ordered the siliciana pizzetta, which came with a tomato bisque soup. I had the soup first (obviously), and it tasted alright. In terms of the pizzetta itself, the ingredients tasted delicious, but the crust was partially burnt. While it tasted great overall, I can't justify a 4 star rating simply because it's not even close to the best pizza I've had given the price, and the fact the crust was partially burnt to begin with.  Service, to be fair, was excellent. While the order system is a bit confusing, the waitresses made sure our food was ordered and to exactly how we wanted, and with that I'll give them credit.  Will I come back? I might consider trying the main branch, but I know there's a lot more pizza places in Toronto (and the GTA)."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! I have come eighth time at this restaurant. I am sitting here as I am writing this review. The staff are so friendly, the food is so good, and the service is exceptional. The price is decent too! The owner, Chad, is extremely friendly and knows what he is doing."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to dine if you want to temporarily escape from the mall food court atmosphere!  They did a great job with Dine on 3, but let's face it, it's just a glitzy food court that hosts KFC, A&W, Manchu Wok, whatever else that you'd find in any mall.  Tip:  After being seated by the hostess, you have to write down your order yourself and bring it to the counter.  Your food/drinks will be brought to you.  Pay at the end.  I cannot say whether or not it's \"authentic\" thin crust pizza, but it's not as thin as Pizzeria Libretto, especially the crust.  And depending on what pizza you get, it can get a bit soggy towards the centre of the pie.  Still good, marinara sauce tasted fresh 'n tangy!  I would recommend the Italian sodas, nice 'n refreshing addition to my dinner.  Service was pleasant, people who worked there seemed very friendly!  Keep in mind that with a drink, dinner will run you about double than what you're paying out at the food court.  However, the atmosphere is a bit better!"}
{"text":"This is a review for the Yorkdale location. I had the best Margherita pizza here. The pizza is made from very fresh ingredients and is cooked in an oven straight from Italy. The dough is also ordered from Italy. The dough is mixed fresh every single day, from scratch. The service was great, and the pizza was delicious. Pricey, though."}
{"text":"Their staffs are always friendly and helpful. They're also very proud of the fact that their food are made from scratch, and it shows. The cheese that they use are not your run-of-the-mill stuff, they are GOOD. Their Prosciutto Wrapped Mozza Balls are a must-try. We were going for three, but the girl said, \"most will find having just one a person is not enough.\" Since there were three of us, we ordered six....and we cleaned them out in a jiffy....including my wife who's not a big fan of cheese. The Gorgonzola Walnut Salad is fresh, the gorgonzola cheese is just heavenly. As for the pizza, you can randomly choose any of them, and you won't really go wrong. This is definitely a place we'll come back time and time again...just need to make sure we pace ourselves to make sure we have room for dessert next time."}
{"text":"This is one of those reviews that I hate doing because the service really outperforms the food and the restaurant.  The Coles note version is that good servers try hard but if they're set up to fall on their face... they're going to do it gracefully :(.  Lousy servers just explode in the same scenario.  So back to the review... inside the amazing Dine on 3 Yorkdale space, Famoso pizza set up shop and it's quite the popular happening restaurant space.  We arrived at 12:30 pm to a near capacity restaurant that has a lot of buzz and movement.  Little did we realize that the lightning speeds of the service was to accommodate the super lousy service model.  The service model doesn't work... similar to a fast food joint, you line up and place your order upfront at a cashier.  After that you're seated to a full service experience.  The problem is the cashier... it's a funnel bottle neck that forces you to wait 10-15 minutes.  Part of the problem is that the cashier has to explain this crazy process to EVERY new client because it's not intuitive AND there's only one cashier.  Plus this cashier is supposedly handling things like dessert (more on this later).  She works hard but she's clearly overtaxed.    The menu is laid out on counter at the cashier for you to choose... Ideal scenario would be to hand out menus while in line to speed things up or be a true fast food joint and display them brightly and loudly so people can see them from afar.  When people are given a menu of multiple courses to choose from... you can clearly see who are the indecisive ones.  They're the ones that hold up the line looking like bambi in the headlights of a Mack truck.  The worst thing is the new indecisive clients... it's one thing to take a look time to decide, it's another thing to be undecided and ask a billion questions.  Anyhow, we order quickly because we knew what we wanted (Famoso salad with grilled chicken, large bbq chicken pizza ... sacrilege I know but I didn't order it!, a steamwhistle, americano, and dessert to be decided later).  We found a table and to the credit of the servers, they were really efficient on getting things from the kitchen area to the tables and overall clearing the tables.  From the moment we ordered, sat down, got a set of fresh plates and cutlery AND the pizza with salad... it maybe was at most 6 minutes!  That was impressive.  The pizza itself wasn't impressive.  For the price of $15, it was a good value.  It can feed a hungry man and maybe 2 petite people (maybe).  The bbq sauce was sickly sweet and not to my liking.  I will commend the kitchen staff on not being stingy with the toppings.  It had lots of grilled chicken, good amount of fresh cheese, tomato, cilantro, and onions.  Aside from the sauce, I say the ingredients were good.  The pizza dough itself was chewier and more dense than other Neapolitan places.  There was no char or nicely tasty bubbled crust.  It's not in the same realm as Pizza e Pazi or Pizza Libretto (to be fair, they don't try to be either).  I would compare them to a Panago Pizza.  It's a higher price point than the average pizza but it is a better pizza as well.  My Famoso salad was a bit disappointing.  For $13, I got a big bowl of leaves with chicken on it.  It was super light on the toppings ... maybe a few chick peas and a scrimping of other items.  The chicken wasn't dry... that was good thing and the salad wasn't doused in oil.  Definitely not worth it.   Now the painful part... Don't order dessert unless you have an extra 45 minutes of nothing to do. The whole full service process fails after you order at the bottleneck cashier.  We waited 20 minutes standing at the front to just TRY the gelato flavours and then another 15 minutes to get the gelato order.  PAINFUL.  If you want dessert, order it upfront at the cashier.  That being said, the Chai Latte gelato is really good.  Think of it as a gourmand richer vanilla.  With more spices, it adds a sophisticated note to an otherwise warm vanilla.  The mango banana gelato is ok.  It really should be just called Banana sorbetto as the mango flavour is minuscule.  The tiramisu is said to be imported from Italy... perhaps they mean the marscapone cheese only?  Anyhow, my eating partner loved it and said it was one of the better ones they've had.  It was light, creamy, doused with real espresso, with cakelike lady fingers holding their structure and was a nice sponge of flavour instead of being a wet tissue of gloopy mess.    Overall, it is a pricier lunch for food court ($45) but it's a nice change from the usual Teriyaki Experience or Chipotle.  I'm hoping they fix their service model because that would make a profound difference."}
{"text":"Pizza is made fresh and delicious. Almost tastes like real Neapolitan pizza. Service is attentive and efficient. Well worth the extra price from the food court if you just want to sit and relax a little after walking through Yorkdale."}
{"text":"This is tucked away in the Yorkdale 'cafeteria' and has it's own seating. They don't do slices so be prepared to share.  This makes it perfect for groups or even a nice date spot (especially with the classy decor).  Due to the concept of sharing, you can try many a pizza and still not break the bank.  It actually ends up coming to under $10 for splitting half a pizza, which is quite impressive for such a nice place. The pizza here is a step up from Pizza Pizza.  It's also much better than some of the other fancier pizza places I've tried. I love mushrooms, so an obvious choice was the funghi pizza (vegeterian).  We also ordered the Sweet BBQ Chicken.  The pizzas were bomb! Service was also spectacular.  The manager was in that day and he even asked us how we enjoyed our experience. The comment below discusses their setup - placing the order and sitting down to have it brought to you.  In my experience, this process definitely quickens speed of service.  However, because of how nice the establishment is it would be nice to have people serving you.  Yet, some element of service still exists because wait staff comes by to fill your beverages."}
