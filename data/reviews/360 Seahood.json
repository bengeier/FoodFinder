{"text":"The sign still says it's in its soft opening stage.  Good takes time to cook so if you order a lot of skewers and have a large group, it would be a good idea to order other dishes.   The skewers won't have the charcoal flavour since the grills are electric. It was more entertainment than the food.  Skewers add up if you intend to fill up in it. They generally ranged from 2.99 to 6.99 so we didn't order a full meal's worth.   Wait times for a table could take a while. The table by the door gets a cold draft whenever someone goes in or out so it wasn't an ideal spot but we didn't want to wait for another table to open up.   Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I went there last week and pop in just before it closed I love the rotating  system .   Kind of gimmicky but I like to cook. I  like my lamb medium rare.   My freind like their crispy and we'll done.    they seated us next to the owners or staff .    They were drinking and loud, but it was odd to sit us next to them since it was empty.     We order the mixed combo of meat and bag of Crawfish.      The Crawfish tasted ok but it was lacking something.   They had  sign saying soft opening hut it been open for a long time.   Maybe just to make excuses for potential bad service I guess.   The prices are similar to other BBQ in the area."}
{"text":"The food was very flavourful and spicy. The skewers are a must. Make sure you flavour them whom they rotate and get cooked. The main course portions are huge. Very happy we ordered just one main course as it can be had by four people!   Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"The food is good. But it is not worth. We went with 5 people and we were barely full. Our bill was 75$ and we were still hungry."}
{"text":"Not sure what most people here are complaining about but we went on a busy weekend night and ordered the usual skewers and D19 which was a chicken with noodle dish. The food was full of flavour especially D19 - just the right amount of spice. We even had our waiter flavour our skewers for us and he did a fantastic job.  Some people here complaining about the price... Maybe a tad expensive but not stupid expensive for sure. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Not recommend to my yelp fans. This place is over price. The equipment they used might be new and interesting to most people but the food quality was bad. Don't not order Lamb and chicken kabob!!!"}
{"text":"?????????? ?????????  To start things off, this place got a giant tv on the window at the front door broadcasting league of legends...  +1 right there.  The entire place is filled with tvs playing league related videos. The tables are all labled with a number and a league of legend champion, so its pretty cool. Most snacks come raw on a skewer and you put it on a mini conveyer belt and it rotates the skewer and cooks the meat for you. So its kinda like kbbq cept its on a skewer.   It is NOT ayce, but the price is $30/ person on avg depending on how much you can eat. I wouldnt say its too pricey for something unique like this.   There is a variety of food choices, mostly all snacks.. for example, clamshells, mussles, beef/lamb kabobs(skewers), fried potatoe chips.. etc  so pretty much all the taiwanese snacks you expect to see at a chinese night market (taste of asia/night it up) .   It also claims to have free wifi... but it kinda disappears every 2 seconds, soo..... idk.. lol.   But overall its good [="}
{"text":"I wanted to stay this place because the auto rotating BBQ looked cool but that's pretty much the only positive thing I have to say about this place   after a long day at the beach my friends and I decided to try this place out because we were craving some skewers. upon arrival it was promptly seated but were left to fead for ourselves after that. 20 minutes passed and we finally got some waters and our orders in. I opted for the jelly fish salad and skewers combo. as you have to cook the skewers yourself the food came quickly. you have an array of spices you can put on the skewers so please be aware of how much you put. The skewers tasted decent at best but were not filling what so ever. The meat wasn't the best quality and was very chewy.   service/ meh food/meh price/ high considering you have to order a lot to get full."}
{"text":"This Restaurant Was labelled as a Soft opening, and we went here for the Unique Chinese bbq Experience, The Place had a very good looking Decor overall, and there is a center grill placed in each table, for the people to grill the skewers of meat and veggie.  Overall it was super packed, on the friday night we showed up. the restaurant was still as we can tell trying to get used to it, as their table placing system was not good, and the service was slow. we waited for about 20-25 minutes before we could grab a table, which wouldn't' seem so bad, except that they had 4 empty tables they labelled as reserved which was obviously not because later we got the exactly same empty table that we had been staring at for 20 minutes.  The food overall we felt there was many problem with the skewers. because they had no spices on them. and needed customer to place their own spices. this woudl be a good idea if the grill wasn't so hot that it basically burned hadn for people trying to place the spices while the grill was running. The grill was also so hot that we saw many people sweating and asking for it to be turned off.   The food was subpar at best to be honest even the cooked dishes that we had, and also the experience was a one time thing, once you've tried it your better off going to a real chinese bbq where they serve you. This price was also pricer then other restaurants where they actually cook the food for you and doesnt' require you to do it yourself.   I understand the experience was supposed to be a bonus, but the way they have it structured right now. it is a minus.   the best i would recommend is for people to try it once, and avoid it. Its not worth the money, and overall the service in the restaurant was not up to snuff.   The only reason i give it 2 star was becuase it is clean, and the concept i can see has potential, overall the cooked food was not terrible, it just wasn't good enough to justify going to this place."}
{"text":"Nice little place. Saw that you can grill your own skewers and wanted to try it. Ordered the 3 meats and shrimp skewers, and the bacon(?) wrapped leeks. We wanted to take our time cooking and did a few skewers, but the server came by and placed everything  on the grill. He even seasoned the meat for us. Not sure if he was rushing us or thought we were clueless about what to do with our food. Our drinks took awhile to get, asked them twice and in the end they told us they lost our order. The ac started leaking water behind me.. Not drips, but continuous flow. They had to put a cart to collect the leak. Despite all that, overall experience was good. The restaurant was clean, and not that noisy. Food was good, and drink prices ain't bad."}
{"text":"I went to try this restaurant out, as it was a brand new opening in the plaza, and was already very popular it seems. The service for this restaurant already did not seem good, becuase as we walked in and asked for a table, they had us wait 30 minutes even though there were 5 empty tables available in front of us. which they actually gave us the same empty table that we were staring at for 30 minutes. Clearly they haven't worked out their system yet.   This restaurant is based on the northern style chinese bbq, except it is a do it yourself one. Which means you get a grill in front of you for you to cook while they bring you the meat. However this is an a la carte restaurant and not all you can eat like the korean bbq restaurants.   The restaurant i feel has a very clean and good look, and the dishes are not bad overall i especially liked the sticky rice dishes. However when it comes to the main part which is the bbq i find it is lacking.   The meat for the bbq is not marinated when it comes to you, and they expect you to sprinkle your own spices on it to cook. Now this usually doesn't seem like a problem, except for the fact that the grill is very hot, and makes you feel like your in front of a radiator.   one part that made the least sense was the bread that they were supposed to provide for bbq, the bread they provided was too big to fit into the bbq grill, and touched the fire part. which means your eating bread with marintated sauce but impossible to grill.  Overall the price and the meat and the experience i feel is not worth it, and i would not go again to this place. the service is also something that needs great improvement."}
{"text":"i would never go back to this place again.  we spend about $43 bucks for some skewers and noodles.  it's very expensive  and the portions are small.  we ordered a seafood noodle dish and the noodles were instant noodles!!!  you can either have the kitchen grill the skewers for you or you can grill the skewers yourself right in front of you.  there is a neat little grill set into the table and the grill rotates your skewers for you.  it's an electric grill.  we actually ordered some shredded tofu, some corn, the noodle dish and the skewer platter.  4 items.  if we ordered more we would have paid even more and i just wanted to minmize the damage to my wallet.  i barely ate anything because my wife and my daughter were starving and so i let them eat most of the food.  another strange thing was that the place did not serve any drinks whatsoever!!!  not even water, i had to ask for water which came from the tap.  just terrible service from the waiting staff.  this is a mainly mandarin speaking crowd.    i had a terrible experience here and i could not wait to get out!!!!!!  what a waste of my money!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner as we had a craving for lamb skewers. We came across something like this in New York, so it was cool to see one in Toronto too. I love the concept of cooking your own skewers. Salt, red pepper and cumin were available to season to your liking. However, this is by no means all you can eat. It is a la carte and you order the skewers in bunches of usually 4. The lamb was really good!  There were some pre-grilled items as well, personally it would have been a better experience if we could grill it ourselves as they came out room temperature (however we were able to warm them on the top rack). That was my only complaint.  They also had bags of seafood boiled in sauce, from mussels to crawfish. The sauce was great and loved the corn in it!  We will definitely return here with bigger appetites. I can see this to be a great place for drinks as well!"}
{"text":"+.5 for service  I've been here twice now, the first one from curiousness when I dined at Yang's BBQ and noticed this interesting place popping up. I enjoyed it the first time so much that I reserved to come a second time the week after.  360 Seahood (intentionally spelled that way) is a restaurant that focuses on both grilled BBQ and boil in a bag seafood. However, the menu is all in Chinese, so best if you don't know Chinese to accompany with someone who knows how to read Chinese. The employees do know English though, although communication might be a bit slow at times.  I went with the lamb, beef, chicken, and sausage skewers, as those tend to be the staples of grilled BBQ. The meats all come raw and you have to put the skewers into a 360 degree revolving grill for it to be cooked. You can also put as much (or as little) spice and cumin as you like. Personally I prefer this system, as my spice tolerance is quite low and I find many places to overdo on spices even if I told them to not put less on. I was satisfied with the lamb, beef, and chicken skewers, but the sausage ones were large but lacked the juiciness of the other meats.  As for the boil in a bag seafood, I tried the one with clams, and I will warn you beforehand: The sauce is extremely spicy, and according to the employees there's no way they can reduce the spiciness. It probably tasted okay in the end, but I was bawling my eyes out with each bite so there was no way I could've finished them all.  Service was very good in my end, and if you don't know how to use the grill initially a server will teach you. For a place that's mostly catered to mainlanders (and hence one shouldn't expect top notch service), I was pleasantly impressed with the service here. I'll likely return if I'm in a grilled BBQ mood, although for sausages I'll likely stick to Yang's."}
{"text":"What makes seafood unique is their auto-rotate BBQ. They have large variety of skewers, mains and side dishes. My family and I came here on a Monday night and we were seated immediately. The food came quickly but was overpriced for what it was. Note that this place only accepts cash! Will probably not be returning.   Cons -Communicating with the staff is quite difficult as they are not English speaking and the menu order sheets are in Chinese -The one chilly spicy level is extremely spicy even for spice lovers (can't imagine what 2 - 4 chilly spice level would be).  -We had asked for no spice for D19 - special stir fried chicken, and our dish came with an abundance of chilly peppers. Even the spice lovers in my family were unable to enjoy the dish.  We spoke with 3 different employees before they omitted the dish from our bill.   Pros -The food that wasn't too spicy was nicely flavored -The portion of the main dishes are huge -The concept and decor of the restaurant were nice"}
{"text":"One thing that made me really want to try this restaurant was their auto-rotate bbq system. You simply place the skewers in the slot and they automatically rotate and cook - pretty cool I must say. All you have to do is sprinkle some seasoning (chili powder and salt). They have a wide variety of skewer options. I ordered the meat combo, comes with chicken, beef, shrimp and lamb, 4 skewers for each meat. The beef, lamb and chicken were all marinated. I thought the chicken meat tasted the best, meat was most tender. The shrimp was really dried out, pretty much impossible to peel off the shells so i just ate it all. They also have pineapple on a skewer available for $5. At that price you would hope they would serve fresh pineapples but nope, it was canned pineapples and tasted horrible.   Apparently Seahood has the same concept as Captain boil, eating seafood boiled in a bag drenched in spicy sauce. Since Captain boil always seemed to be out with crawfish, i decided to try crawfish here. Its nice how they dont have a fixed price per pound since crawfishes are quite heavy and the actual meat inside is like the size of your pinky - $13 for a bag. In the bag there were approximately 10? The only thing i would say is it felt kinda cruel having to break and pick out the meat, felt like i was dissecting the crawfish. Originally the sauce has 3 peppers but we asked for mild, still quite spicy. The sauce didnt have much flavor other than tasting hot.  Overall the food was ok, but nothing special. Interesting concept, but more of a gimmick. I found the restaurant trying to be everything - the seafood in the bag, and the bbq style, and also they had normal chinese dishes as well. I don't think I would come back."}
{"text":"The 2nd Captain's Boil I've been to and the experience was better I suppose. I like this location better than the downtown one probably because you didn't feel rushed or it felt less frantic. However I did find a hair in my food... so that kind of ruined the experience."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this restaurant and how they have the skewer grill on the table. So I decided to finally go try it out. Unfortunately, the menu has complete changed. The only thing that can be grilled on there is the lamb. The meat platter is no longer available and everything is very quiet there. For the cost of the food, it wasn't even worth eating there. At that point, I kindly asked the waitress to cancel the table as we quickly left this restaurant without eating.  Overall, I just want to let everyone know that those grill don't exist anymore."}
{"text":"The waitress was extremely friendly & helpful, I think that's what making me give this a 3* instead of 2*.   We got 3 different types of skewers (that we chose to cook ourselves overt their table cooker, pretty cool it spins the skewers as it cooks)  - beef: came in 12 but the pieces of meat were extremely small  - chicken: both my BF & I didn't like it - pork: the only good tasting one that night - beef brisket fried rice: it was well worth it's price, a large portion, larger than the one you'd get at Chat Bar   Overall it was a nice try, but I wouldn't go back. I'll stick with chat bar if I'm craving late night skewers even if it's a little pricier"}
{"text":"Restaurant itself was really nice-looking. Most of the staff did not know how to speak English, and it was hard to order since the menu sheets were in Chinese (so bring a friend who knows how to read chinese!! lol). Also, it would have been good if the food options had pictures, because we were really unsure of what most of the options were  Watching the food roast in front of you was cool and a good experience, but the food was only okay.  Will definitely come back once it opens officially, since when we went it was still their \"soft opening\""}
{"text":"Came here last night and love the food here.  I haven't been eating meat but it's cute that you get these meat skewers and cook them yourself.  They homage sweet potato chips and regular potato chips that are the bomb. I would come back just for that.  They also have potato noodle which is cool since it's actually potato turned into noodles.  I would definitely come back here for sure.  A must try!"}
