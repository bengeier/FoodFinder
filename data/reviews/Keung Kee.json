{"text":"Nous venons dans ce restaurant de façon régulière depuis au moins trois ans. Même si la déco laisse toujours autant a désirer la qualité est toujours au rendez-vous.
Nous  apprécions notamment leurs plats de homard et ses légumes vapeur.  Très savoureux. Nous suggérons notamment le homard au gingembre. A s'en lécher les doigts!
Même si les serveurs ne sont pas spécialement souriants ils restent tout de même efficaces. Nous recommandons sans hésitation."}
{"text":"Very authentic Cantonese fare.  Very friendly staff. Prices fair and typical for portions in big city.  Service attentive and prompt.  Garlic snow pea tips as good as I've had them.  Very good.  Typical warm charm of real Chinese resto. Would definitely return. Open late."}
{"text":"Authentic, affordable Cantonese food. Their lunch menu is also tasty and of good value; congee (particularly century egg & pork and ten tsai jook) and beef tendon noodle soup (au gan tong mein) are personal favourites."}
{"text":"The food was alright and the service was so-so, but the reason I will not return is because they sell shark fin soup, which is a highly unethical and cruel practice, considering the way the sharks have their fins cut off while alive and the rest is thrown back in the water or goes to waste. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"After ascending the stairs, one is transported into an authentic Chinese restaurant complete with plastic, white table cloths and seemingly dingy decor.  The food is delicious and the service is speedy.  During our visit the host was especially friendly and spoke English very well.  As far as the food, the Beef Stir-fry with Chinese broccoli was quite delectable as was the Steamed shrimp with garlic.  However, the shrimp weren't peeled nor cleaned, something that was more an annoyance than anything.  Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for tasty Chinese cuisine in Montreal."}
{"text":"I would give restaurant a negative star rating if possible.  First of all, I ordered wonton noodle soup with  BBQ Pork.  When my order came, there were no noodles, and I was given a combination of ingredients instead of my BBQ Pork.  

When I asked what happened to the noodles and BBQ pork only, the waiter said that the restaurant just ran out of noodles.  Okay you ran out noodles, but what happened to my preference for BBQ pork only? 

I think that the restaurant opened up at 11:30am.  My fiance and I were there at 12:00pm.  How can they run out of noodles within a half hour of opening???  

Second, my fiance ordered sesame chicken with jelly fish for $12.95. The waitress tells my fiance that they are out of sesame chicken, but they can replace it with yellow chicken.  

When we got the bill, there was an additional $5.00 tacked on for the yellow chicken.  The original dish was $12.95.  The new price for the chicken dish was $17.95.  When we asked what the price increase was for, we were told that the price went up because they replaced the dish with a different kind of chicken.  

It would have been nice if they told us of the increase in price rather than assuming that everything would be okay.  It is the same with my wonton noodle soup.  They never told me of any changes.  They just brought out my dish.  This is so wrong!

Five dollars isn't a whole lot of money.  It is just the principle that we were getting ripped off.  We complained about what they did.  After going back and forth for a little while, they finally corrected the bill.

As for the food, the yellow chicken was very tough and not that tasty.  Where the wonton soup os concerned, the wonton tasted okay, but the soup base was kind of bland.

We will not be returning back to this clip joint.   Be aware of their shady tactics if you decide to dine here."}
{"text":"This meal was a gigantic disappointment.  We placed a large order, and all we were delivered was rude service, mediocre food at best, and a huge bill for 4 dishes we never received.  If I could give this restaurant zero stars I would.  

 After calling the restaurant to order for delivery, I was assured I could pay cash if I ordered through just-eat.com.  This was incorrect and after making a profile and ordering I was forced to pay by credit card, after calling again and being told it was the only way to order delivery.  

Upon receiving our meal, we were given only 3 out of 6 items paid for.  After multiple calls we were told that they would rectify their mistake and send the rest of our food.  After an hour and a half the food hadn't arrived and upon calling again we were hung up on by rude and dismissive staff.  They were hugely disrespectful.   Eventually they promised to refund us the money if the food didn't arrive within an additional half hour.  Obviously we received nothing after 45 minutes and called back.  They then refused to refund us our payment.

Of the food we received, it was greasy and disgusting.  Nothing of note and overpriced for the food we were actually delivered.  If you want to deal with rude and arrogant people only to receive insufficient,  disappointing food, order from keung kee."}
{"text":"The taste of down home Chinese food from the House soup to the jelly fish.

The service is efficient with food arriving promptly.

We had the sesame jellyfish with chicken.  Very nice texture on both the chicken and the jellyfish.

We had the seafood Chowmien (panfried noodles).  It was good with lots of seafood and chinese broccoli for balance.

We also had an order of beef with chinese broccoli.  It is my benchmark for a good place and they do it well.

Only drawback is beer prices.  It is rather expensive for a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is great, everything actually tastes so good here. HOWEVER, the service is just AWFUL. Mainly because the bald waiter has such a bad temper and is just plainly rude... Furthermore if you don't leave enough tips he will shout at you -_-"}
{"text":"Come here with my family and son's room mate when we visit my son at university this weekend, whole family and son's friend love it. Good Cantonese food, fast service, good chinese prices. Basic but clean, whole restaurant use plastic tablecloth. Best food we had in Montreal Chinatown, delicious Shanghai stir fry noodle and jook, much better than other more expensive restaurants."}
{"text":"The seafood is very fresh, but the service is terrible. They are very rude and easily irritated. It is upstairs, and you can feel people walking around."}
{"text":"If you want an authentic chinese restaurant ( Hong Kong style) and you're tired of chinese/american buffet this is the place in Montreal.

It's really affordable betweek 10-14 $ for a plate.

And usually in this kind of restaurant everybody order a various meals and every body taste every plate. 

And the shrimps, beef and squid plates were excellent ! I liked them all !

We were 10 and on saturday they found us a big table easily so it's a plus !

The only thumb down is that the servers have a neutral face anytime, but as the service is fast and i only worry about the food it's ok. Also they don't speak french and just bit of english anyway just show them the menu and it's ok !   


Si vous voulez un repas chinois authentique ( style Hong kong) et que vous ëtes tannés des buffet Americano-chinois ! C'est un excellent endroit ou manger à Montréal.

C'est très abordable vous pouvez compter entre 10 et 14$ par plat. 

Habituellement  dans ce genre de restaurant tous le monde commande un plat différent, et on partage tous les plats afin que tous puissent goûter à la variétés de plats offert !

Nous étions un groupe de 10 un samedi soir, et ils nous ont trouvés une grande table facilement ce qui est très bien !

La seul point négatif est que les serveurs ne parlent pas français ( juste à leur montrer le menu !), et juste un peu l'anglais. 

Ils ont aussi un visage neutre à chaque fois qu'il vous servent. Vu que la qualité de la nourriture et la vitesse du service est ce qui m'importait vraiment c'était correct dans l'ensemble.

À essayer !"}
{"text":"Shrimp toast - Great
Salt Shrimp - Ok
Wonton Soup - Questionable
Singapore Noodles - Horrid

Crazy range of quality across the menus."}
{"text":"Excellent service en français! Menu très varié! Plats très savoureux! Nous reviendrons certainement bientôt."}
{"text":"Overall: the food is pretty good, and looks nice too.  The restaurant is clean and the ambiance is fine (though I dislike the garbage bag-like tablecloths that seem to be common in Chinatown).  The service we got at lunch was good too; better than most restaurants in Chinatown.

My biggest complaint is that the mushroom, bamboo vegetable dish was too oily and starchy.  Delicious, but definitely not healthy.  This also seems to be a characteristic of most of the restaurants in Chinatown.

I will definitely go back here at some point, but it wasn't so spectacular that I need to go back tomorrow.  But it's better than similar restaurants on de la Gauchetiere below it.

Prices were average for Chinatown ($6-9 for lunch before tax)."}
{"text":"Excellent preserved (century) egg congee with a wonderful hint of ginger. Add a dash of soya sauce and some white pepper and you're good to go. We also had a very nice mushroom tofu marmite hotpot. That was the pinnacle of savoury shroomie goodness. There was an amazing garlic gai-lan (Chinese broccoli) steamed to perfection. I ordered an off-the-menu preserved egg with ginger which is just so incredibly delicious. For dessert there was zhà xi?n nai (deep fried condensed milk custard) which was crispy and golden on the outside and creamy and silky and voluptuous on the inside. Everything was very very good. This place is open late and is on point. It his the spot. I love the delicious ambiance of the Quartier chinois just after midnight. It's got a lovely feel to it. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the food. 2 stars for the service.  Food is quite good, very authentic southern Chinese - among the most authentic I had in MTL. I go there often, but service is, well..."}
{"text":"Unsure if this was a tourist trap or not, took a gamble and walked up the long flight of stairs; was relieved to find that everyone in the joint was Asian.  A good indicator of the food quality, as far as I'm concerned.

Beef hot pot was a great move on a rainy evening.  More popular with everyone around us was the fried lobster.  Seemed that every table was sharing a what looked to be a 5-pound plate of the stuff.  That will be the first priority on the next Montreal visit.  This was the best Cantonese I've had in a very long time."}
{"text":"Keung Kee is a chinatown institution. From the waiters to the decor to the food this is an unforgettable Hong Kong style dive that is especially memorable late at night. No idea what the chinese writing on the wall is all about and wouldn't dare to ask, but ask for the salt and pepper shrimp with the shells."}
{"text":"For the Cantonese cuisine,this is the good restaurant compare with the other Cantonese restaurant...the food was delicious,but the service is not really friendly...and the place need to renovate,everything is too old and looks dirty!"}
{"text":"Very good authentic Chinese food.  Located upstair in Chinatown alley."}
{"text":"We had planned dinner at our favorite restaurant in Montreal's Chinatown but since it was hosting a banquet, we ended up at this Cantonese restaurant walk-up.

At 5 pm, the staff was still in the middle of the family meal but they welcomed and sat us quickly. The restaurant featured disposable plastic tablecloths, mismatched chairs (some of them were folding) and tight spaces. Despite this, there was a line of guests that snaked down the stairs as guests settled in for a wait.

We selected a number of dishes, which when served family style, highlighted our love of sweet and sour flavor combinations. We gorged ourselves on crunchy stir-fried shrimp and chopped onions in tomato sauce; tender, crispy fried pork with onions and peppers in a sweet and sour sauce (my fave); fried shrimp and chicken with mayonnaise; savory crispy-skin duck with a sweet hoisin sauce, and a slightly spicy General Tso's chicken. A complimentary pork/black bean broth-based soup was served at the start of the meal, and similar to many other Chinese restaurants, orange wedges were served at the end.

With quick service and a hungry table, we were done quickly, freeing up the table for the other hungry guests."}
{"text":"My group arrived in Montreal from New York on Tuesday and we were craving Chinese food hard by Friday. If you want legitimate canto food come here. It was just like home."}
{"text":"I've lived in Singapore for about 30 years and love the Chinese cuisine there which is slightly different from that in Hongkong and certainly China itself. For the last 12 years I've lived in USA and can't find Chinese restaurants on par with those I've frequented in Singapore until I came to Montreal's Chinatown and Keung Kee! The steamed fish was done to perfection and also our favorite razor clam and Chinese broccoli. 

We were so happy with lunch that we reserved a table for dinner the same day and it was fortunate that we did because it was packed on a Friday. For dinner we had Beijing Duck. Unfortunately the skin came with more meat and was not as crispy as the ones in Singapore. It was more the Hongkong style. Still it was quite acceptable."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and the food was solid. They have many good lunch specials. The Singapore noodles needed a little more seasoning but still very good. The tofu stuffed with shrimp (from the regular menu) was delicious. Servings are very generous"}
{"text":"I'm from Hong Kong and have lived there almost all my life, and this is authentic - from the food to the unceremonious service. 

It's not exactly a hole in the wall place, since it has nice-ish decor (good for a sit down dinner), but the service is definitely very HK i.e. servers are kinda curt and food is plopped onto the table unceremoniously. Nothing appalling, just typical of service back home where efficiency is everything. It's worth it for the food though! Very authentic and surprisingly good, especially for the one seafood item we tried. There are seafood specials listed on signs around the dining area, mostly all in Chinese, but worth a try. Besides that, they also have lunch specials (11:30a-3p I think) that are a pretty good deal for around CAD5-8 per dish if you're looking for a quick lunch).

We got:
// oysters in garlic // 
REALLY good! Oysters are huge and tender, and the soy sauce / garlic hybrid that the oyster is cooked in is delicious (I poured the sauce onto some fried rice and devoured it). Seems like seafood is pretty decent here! 

// vegetables (tong choi) stir fried in fermented tofu //
Miss these vegetables dearly - portions are generous and it is prepared in the typical way, with the leafy bits soaking up the sauce and the thin stalks providing a bit of a crunch. The fermented tofu is salty and delicious, but may be an adventurous choice if you're not used to it.

// wonton noodles // 
I am quite picky about wonton noodles, but this is pretty solid. Noodles could have just a tiny bit more bite to it but the wonton itself is pretty good.

// crispy noodles with meat //
It has the crispy noodle base, and the tender noodles soaking up the sauce on the top part. 

// salted fish fried rice //
Definitely pungent (without being stinky), but that's the way I like it - again very authentic and might not be for everybody, but it is pretty good."}
{"text":"If you like tofu don't come here it was soggy and wet, the general Tao didn't taste like general tao. The veggies in the Shanghai noodles were not fresh. The calamari was  60% good, done pieces were too rubbery and the frying job was poor, very oily and too salty. The soups were tasty though."}
{"text":"Cantonese food might be the kind of food I eat the most often (mostly due to my parents having strict tastes when it comes to food). Surprisingly, I have never been to this place until one of my friends (who happens to not be cantonese) brought me to it. 

The restaurant is popular, especially with older asian people and families (with is always a good sign when going in a chinese restaurant). The wait are sometimes long, but on that day, we got lucky and we were seated right away at 9pm on a Saturday evening. 

We ordered Yeung Chow fried rice and a place of sall & pepper squid. The fried rice was well seasoned with mixed flavors and the squid was well fried and crispy with lots of flavor. Now that I discovered this place, I will definitely come back when I'll crave some comfort food."}
{"text":"Don't let the front door deter you! This is the place to eat!! My dad and I were visiting Montreal and Chinese food sounded go so we looked up this place and decided to go. The place was packed when we got there but we were able to share a table with three other couples. 

We ordered Steamed Chicken with Ginger, General Tao Chicken, Spring Rolls, and Fried Milk for dessert. All of it was delicious but the Fried Milk is out of this world- must try it!!"}
{"text":"Really good general tao. Was pretty busy. Waited about 10 mins for a table on a friday night at 7. Big portions, good flavours. Went specifically for steamed snow pea leaves, they were out of season. A lot of choices, good service. Wasn't blown away."}
{"text":"This is very authentic Chinese food. We only tried their fresh seafood items and vegetable dishes only. Both were excellent. Their free daily soup was great too if you like traditional Chinese soup boiled with pork bones and other different daily ingredients. It was actually their good tasting soup and seafood that made us came back the next day for dinner again!

Since they are only really busy during a short dinner period, they always tried to rush you out and turn over as many tables as possible to maximize their income. Nothing wrong with that if you are tourists like us that just want a good in-and-out meal quick. If you want to stay to chic chat, this is not the place for you. I mean we were served the complimentary small orange plate before we even finished our dinner plates and rice. As soon as we touched the orange plate, we were served the bill too followed up shortly by a waiter with a machine to get your credit card to pay :)."}
{"text":"I am Chinese from Hong Kong. So I may be a bit picky. We ordered BBQ pork. It is nothing like the BBQ pork I have been eating all my life. So dried and salted, the BBQ pork has no flavor, as if boiled in water. The second dish we ordered was Shanghai stir fried noodle. It looked, tasted, and smelled very different from the real thing. I was very disappointed and I will not go back again."}
{"text":"Chinatown, Montreal needs an upgrade (think of this song as you read this, \"Upgrade you\" by Beyonce). Only if I could post an mp3 file w/my yelp reviews. :p

Nevertheless, its the quality of the food that matters. Hence, the crab was delish. Not more delish than the crab in Cali, or in NY, but I'm a crab eating diva, as WInny would put it, so I will be nice and yelp good things about this restaurant. 

Eggplant dish was spicy to the max, just as my bff requested for it to be. She also picked out jalapeno slices and lined them along the rim of her plate. :p"}
{"text":"This was the worst \"food\" we have had in a long, long time. Perhaps the most disgusting, tasteless toilet water ever served to any human. Not sure how they got the gasoline flavour into those mushrooms in the crispy noodles, but that was the only flavour evident. The hot and sour soup was slimy, and again, tasteless. Don't even get me started on the bbq pork. Pure dog food. Don't order from here unless you want to ruin your night off. Im really looking forward to the diarrhea that ensues after this review is complete."}
{"text":"Keung Kee is one of the better Cantonese restaurants in Chinatown. The location is on the second floor, and the decoration is nothing fancy. They have a mix of large and small tables, without any private rooms. 
Just like any other Chinese Restaurants, they often have dishes that are not available in English on the menu. But often these are the ones that I enjoy the most. 
The bottom line is, Keung Kee is a reliable Chinese restaurant with delicious Cantonese food, and a good selection of seafood options such as lobsters, scallops, and razor clams."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Chinese restaurant. The service is not the best by any measure but the food always satisfy my craving for Chinese seafood dishes. 
Some of their specialties are the duck stew, deep fried seafood and deep fried milk sticks. 
I don't know any other restaurant that makes deep fried milk sticks in Montreal, so I was super grateful that they make it. They are very tasty! Crispy on the outside, soft, tender and sweet in the inside. They are kind of like deep fried ice cream but better. 
I also like their salt and pepper seafood, deep fried as well. But this dish is so flavourful, the skin is coated with right amount of seasoning but the seafood inside still kept their freshness. 
They are a seafood restaurant so make sure you order lots of seafood!"}
{"text":"During the same trip to Montreal we've been to this place twice. The first time, the food was amazing and left us craving for more. We had duck soup, stir fried scallops and sesame beef. The soup and scallops were to die for. If only for that day, we would have given 5 stars, no doubt. However, the second time the food was good, but the salted and peppered seafood was way to salty and was battered (although no word of it in the menu). Except  of that, all other food was good. We also had scallops in satay sauce, two soups (shrimp wonton and beef, preferred the latter) and some chicken dishes. The prices are reasonable, you can choose small, medium or large size for soups and rice. They also have all kinds of other seafood. Would also return for the third time :)"}
{"text":"Restaurant Keung Kee is arguably the most authentic Hong Kong place in Montreal. Unfortunately, that's also why it's not the best place for people who are unfamiliar with that style of food and decor. 

I have lived in Hong Kong for 1/3 of my life, and Keung Kee reminds me of the typical restaurants there. The chef is able to reproduce a lot of the tastes and flavours I'm accustomed to eating in HK - often giving nostalgia a tickle. They also have a pretty decent selection of dishes there. 

The staff and decor are reminiscent of HK as well. The staff do not speak French, and, in fact, hardly speaks English at all. They are neither rude or friendly, which is typical of Asian restaurants. The decor, with its colours and oversized drapes, are very much like the ones you would find in HK.

I wouldn't normally recommend this place to the average Joe. However, if you're feeling particular adventurous and are eager to try out a really authentic HK restaurant, then this place is for you."}
{"text":"Yes, finally. After a few months looking for a decent Chinese restaurant. All over Montreal. This place is a hidden gem. Great location right in Chinatown. The food is definitely Hong Kong style dish. Other restaurants around is not nearly close to the taste and quality this place give. Definitely my go-to place for hk food"}
{"text":"I feel like Keung Kee is trapped in time.  It has an enormous menu (about 260 items not including the secret ones on the wall in Chinese) that is split between the classic Cantonese fare and the westernized Chinese food of the 1960's and on.  

It's right in the heart of Chinatown and when we got there, it was packed with locals rather than tourists.  The classic Canto fare was pretty good (snow pea shoots, crispy chicken, fish maw soup) but the westernized fare was not so great (tomato shrimp, fried rice, etc.).  

Prices are reasonable and service is on par with your average Chinatown restaurant.  Place is also relatively clean which is a plus."}
{"text":"We took the advice of our hotel and glad we did.

When you sit down you get a pot of hot tea and they keep it coming.

The portions were huge for lunch and it comes with soup.

Service was quick and friendly.

Great selection for what ever your protein needs."}
{"text":"Keung Kee is my favourite Cantonese restaurant in Montreal. From simple dishes such as fried rice, fried noodles, congee to more complex dishes such as Beijing peaking duck and roast chicken, everything exceeds my expectations every time! 

I heard many of the chefs are from Hong Kong hence they know the original recipes in making tasty Cantonese dishes. It could be very busy at times so plan ahead or make a reservation to avoid disappointment in waiting in line.

They also cook home made desserts and after a big meal, if your stomach still have room - make sure you ask for the soup based Chinese desserts such as red bean soup or coconut saggo which is very yummy.

I come at least one or two times a week for dinner. Say hi if you see me! I'm a regular here."}
{"text":"Short and sweet review, or may be rather salty than sweet. Chinese restaurant on the main strip, second floor, absolutely worthy trying. Customer base consists predominantly of people who will appreciate the authenticity of the  food. The salt and pepper pork is amazing, don't hesitate about it. Nice choice is the salt and pepper toffu, which deserves to  be on the table along with the steamed green beans. Note I would not call the last two dishes vegetarian although they may sound like. We are still in search of the best fried rice in Montreal, meaning the fried rice is not compulsory in Keung Kee. The food we ordered was pretty salty, but the pot of hot tea that was refilled as needed helped me survive. I observed with envy the amazing seafood brought to the neighbouring table, a sign I will be back for seafood or salty, salty yummy pork."}
{"text":"Don't expect them to have a table ready for you even if you made a reservation!!!! They will just put you in a priority queue. There were more than 4 such groups including mine, we had to wait for 35 minutes. They are popular during popular times. Food is apparently authentic and we enjoyed it a lot."}
{"text":"From the entrance , i didn't expect the food to be that good. At first the person welcomed us ( or sort off) didn't smile at all. But our waiter was really good and rather smily. A very vast choice of soups, appetizers , noodles, etc.. we had several dishes to share. We didn't like the shrimp on toast in the appetizers, however the chicken corn soup and the spring rolls were really good. The calamari was nicely prepared , spicy as it should be. The sweet and sour fried shrimp was good , oddly served ( shrimp apart from the sauce) , but we liked it as each put the sauce he like ( soya, spicy , sweet & sour) .   From the main dishes my favorites were the pepper sauce beef as well as the shrimp in lobster sauce. Other enjoyed the sesame chicken as well as the chicken with lemon. These dishes are perfect if you like sweet food. Chicken with black been was also good. We devour almost everything we ordered   .Very big portions, very well prepared. We all enjoyed the evening, the food the services and the relatively affordable bill at the end . I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, clean place, decent service. I think that this is one of the best places you can get authentic Chinese food in the city and if you're going to go here, get the authentic cantonese dishes rather than the western style food. It's worth it and it's a great place to try new things because everything on the menu is great. Don't expect to be doted on like you're in an upscale restaurant and you will leave very full and happy."}
{"text":"The best Chinese restaurant in Chinatown, probably the best on the island. Diverse choice of dishes. 2 favs: Love the spicy green beans and the salt and pepper shrimp. Second floor with clean good customer service. Yes, good customer service in Chinatown. I swear."}
{"text":"Keep in mind, you are in Chinatown, things move fast and WILL get confusing if you don't speak Chinese.
This is my 3rd time i think... ive been here a few times before. This time we were 8, showed up without reservation on a sunday evening and the place was (is always) packed. The hostess first refused us but then one of the waiters patented a table out of 2 smaller ones putting a wheel on top. Boom! 
It's loud, it's chaos. It's your typical Chinese restaurant, so if you are an introvert, take your food to go.
We had quite a feast with bbq duck, spicy squid, salt & pepper fried tofu, giant cooked oysters in black beans, beef broccoli, chicken in clay pot, a couple dishes of noodles, I can't even remember anymore LOL!!!! 
Everything was good. My favs are the oysters, tofu and squid. 
I would come back, hell yes!"}
{"text":"Anyone who rated this less than 5-stars needs to reassess where they're at in life. If you're expecting Michelin dining, you're not in the right place. If you want a pared down menu because you don't know how to make decisions, you're not in the right place. But if you want amazing food at fair price, Keung Kee is for you.

Honestly, everything on the menu is fantastic. I usually don't know what anything is, but I try it anyway... haven't been disappointed yet. Key takeaways so far though: hot and sour soup, salt & pepper anything, the oyster mushrooms and... well, anything really. 

Just go, check out the menu and pick something that speaks to you. Chances are that you'll make the right choice."}
{"text":"If you want authentic real Chinese food, come here! You hear that from a chinese from Montreal!

From seafood to popular sweet and soul porc, XO sauce sauté beef or full salt cooked chicken. You can't go wrong!

In real Chinese restaurant, don't expect A Class service, they put the focus on the food quality.

Price is fair, quality makes it worthwhile."}
{"text":"Yikes!  We were not expecting a huge block party in the museum area on a Friday night and there were thousands of people in the streets and overflowing into the restaurants so it was really hard to get a table anywhere in the vicinity.  Our walk towards the water reached Chinatown shortly and it was like the pick of the draw that we ended up in this place. 
This eatery is everything that you'd expect from a Chinese place with tight seating, loud chattering, less than pleasant service and plastic lined table cloths with a man serving the food with his sweaty white t-shirt rolled up at the sleeves and looked as though he was either the dishwasher or prep cook.   He did a great job bringing the food out and was courteous but I think they should at least get him a collared polo shirt if he is going to be out serving food to the patrons.  The three dishes we ordered was bland and comparable to a fast food Chinese joint.  We had the Chinese broccoli which was good but that would really be hard to mess up.  The other two dishes were braised tofu and orange peel beef.  The tofu was very dry and did not have enough sauce.  The orange beef was a clump of fried beef sauteed in some sweet and sour sauce.
The only saving grace was that the $50 CAD price was only about $37 USD.
Why did I get Chinese food in Montreal?  Cause it was 8pm and getting late!  SORRY FOLKS..but I guess I'm more accustomed to better Chinese cuisine even on an island like Hawaii."}
{"text":"Since I am Cantonese, I am picky with Cantonese food. To be fair, the price is good for the portion, but quality-wise it's really average. Heavy seasoning and difficult not to feel thirsty after each bite. The waiter always wants to push you to choose the expensive dishes (ex: seafood), which is really annoying. But if you have a limited budget and feel quite hungry, this place is indeed a good choice."}
{"text":"best chinese restaurant in chinatown if you know what to order!
best hong kong style dishes in mtl!!!, so if you are ordering, won ton soup,sweet and sour soup,general tao,beef and brocoli,then go somewhere else cause u don't know chinese food"}
{"text":"Parfait riz frite aux crevettes. Merci pour tout Keung Kee!!!"}
{"text":"Très bon et pas cher du tout. Ils n'ont pas trop investi dans le décor depuis les 40 dernières années, ce qui est peut-être une bonne chose. Les serveurs par contre ne parlent presque pas français et à peine l'anglais. Ils ont l'air un peu rude mais ça donne plus d'authenticité."}
{"text":"It's not much to look at, either from the street or once you're inside and up the stairs, but Keung Kee offers quality, well prepared Chinese food at affordable prices. I was surprised when I entered that I was the only non-Asian person there, and I took that as a really good sign - if the locals like it, then it must be good!"}
{"text":"Whenever my folks would be in town, my dad would go out on the hunt for seafood. While buying a king crab in Chinatown, a man suggested we come here because it is said that this place knows their seafood. WOW!!! It was out of this world!!! We got the fixed king crab and lobster meal. Prepared in many ways, our family had the best time savouring our food. Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly! The good kept on coming and by the time the fish came out (the last dish) we were already in food coma mood! It was so good that my dad placed and order for the crab in four days lol! Everything was delicious! Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good and for an \"ethnic\" restaurant it was full of patrons of that ethnicity; always a good sign. Location is upstairs, in the middle of Chinatown. When I went it was 3/4 full and the rest of the restaurants at street level were pretty sparse. Makes me think that this is a place liked by locals. Decor is not fancy, good value."}
{"text":"Been to this place over a dozen times.
Always flavourful food and good service. 
I have even ordered many dishes that are not even in their menu. I just describe to the waiter what I want, and he instructs the chef to cook them for me.
Their beef dishes and dishes with large Chinese mushrooms are my favourite."}
