{"text":"Slas is a great small diner. Very traditional small town American style. Food cooked right in front of you. It can be a bit greasey but it tastes great. Definitely worth going."}
{"text":"Near perfection in a small, \"greasy spoon\" breakfast joint.  Took my daughter here on a recent weekend and have a fantastic experience.  Everything was perfectly cooked...eggs were large, home fries really tasty and not overly greasy, thick-cut pepper bacon was crisp, pancakes had a delicious flavor (not overly fluffy), good coffee.  The waitress asked us about each breakfast item in detail (like, do you want regular bacon or crispy) and each item came out exactly as we asked for...you gotta love that kind of attention to detail!  Prices were very reasonable and they take credit cards...another plus.  But the coolest thing about this place?  Nearly every person that got up and left (as we sat there enjoying our food) knew Sal by name and greeted him as they left, thanking him for their meals.  To me, that kind of feel and caring is what a great neighborhood restaurant is all about.  We will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"Walked in there on on June 18, at around 12:40pm. I was picking up some food with a friend that we placed over the phone and I must say this is the worst experience I've ever had here. The waitress (Natalie) was very rude and disrespectful. When my friend handed Natalie her payment she swiped the card and then tossed the card back on the counter as if it were a ball. Very rude and immature for someone whose twice my age. Looking at the time we decided to just eat before we traveled to our destinations. When I cut my steak it was cooked to medium when I was asked for it to be cooked well done since that's how I always get it. I was disappointed when I saw that Sal was the one that cooked it because when I've eaten his cooking before he always made it just right.I didn't say anything because I was on a time limit so I just ate i. I asked Natalie how much would it be for two glasses of water she replied \"what do you need?!,\" in a aggravated tone. My friend and I exchanged glances and shook our heads. That was the worst service I had ever dealt with in my life. Natalie should be let go or given a strong speech about her behavior or maturity.  I definitely won't be returning in the morning and I'll just stick to ordering at night since their attitudes are much more friendlier."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast. I have been going here for years. The food is great and the prices are right. There staff is friendly and Sal always welcomes you and makes you feel like family. So drive past McDonald's and pull into Sal's."}
{"text":"I took my girls there every weekend and they are in their twenty s   and i have taken three of my grandson there we all love it and sal"}
{"text":"Love this place.  If you are looking for a great neighborhood breakfast place that serves quick, delicious, inexpensive, nice sized portions of food, this is the place. I had recently moved back from Memphis, TN. When I went back for a welcome home breakfast, I was greeted as if I never left. Great Place with friendly staff. Call in Carryout is a great feature."}
{"text":"Great service, people are kind and warm welcoming. The food was delicious and fresh. I eat healthy and the egg whites and gyro were bomb.com. My friend also enjoyed her breakfast. We shall return!!!!!"}
{"text":"Sals is a perfect little dive diner. It's cheap, it's old school and the food is good. The bacon is great and they must sell a ton of it cause there was a mountain of it next to the grill where Sal was cooking. The staff were all friendly and the food came out fast.  If you're your looking for some good cheap food in an old school diner atmosphere check it out."}
{"text":"It's an old diner.  A bit grungy and outdated but clean.  Fast, friendly service and good cheap eats."}
{"text":"Simple, greasy and perfect. Old school griddle, thick cut bacon and Jumbo eggs.  I've been looking for a breakfast spot for 3 years since I've moved downtown.  This place is exactly what I've been searching for.  Leave your diet and skinny jeans at home."}
{"text":"Now that Sal has retired, this place has changed for the worse.    Today- undercooked gyro meat.  Different crowd than before.   Hopefully this will gradually evolve back into the old Sals!    Based on today's experience, will not return any time soon."}
{"text":"Great spot.  Inexpensive, good food, great service and open 24 hours. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"I've been going to Sals since I was about 5  I am 20 now and I still go as often as possible! Very reasonable prices and awesome food ! The same waitress that worked there when I was little is the same waitress that takes care of me every time I go there to this day! Her name is wafa if you ever visit make sure you sit in her area she's the best of the best. I don't even have to order anymore as soon as she sees me and my boyfriend she grabs our pepsi and says you want your usual and it's as easy as that. My food is in front of me within 10 minutes! Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"This place was previously called Sal's. Now it is Steve's Doghouse. I ordered one of the breakfast specials. Two eggs over easy, three pieces of bacon, home fries with cheese, onions, and gravy, and rye toast. It was all delicious. Very well done. Great price."}
{"text":"Great place for a cheap breakfast that awesome.  Cooked right in front of you. Old time diner with all the charm!"}
{"text":"Think little, dive, diner, and you will know what Sal's is about.  On our way home from a weekend in downtown Cleveland, my wife recommended this little diner based on a previous visit with her co-worker.  We stopped in and it was jam packed.  There were zero of about 20 seats available.  So we waited five minutes and some patrons left, so we took their seats.  Our drink orders were promptly taken and we began to look at the menu.  My wife had a burger on her last visit, so she wanted a burger again, even though it was 11:00 AM!  So she ordered a hamburger with bacon and french fries on the side.  I, of course, was starving for breakfast.  I ordered a veggie omelette with wheat toast and home fries.  Not four feet away was Sal himself cooking away on a small, flat grill, his wife standing by his side preparing eggs.    Ten minutes later, Sal cooked our meal right in front of us.  He put cheese on her burger though, which she didn't want, but she didn't say anything and happily ate it anyway, loving every bite.  My omelette was yummy and my home fries were very tasty.  I put hot sauce on my eggs and home fries, ya'll.  Try it, you'll never go back.  Louisiana, hot sauce, that is.  While we were sitting there, a Metro Life Flight helicopter crew walked in and sat next to us.  It was cool to see them.  I love little hole in the wall diners like this."}
{"text":"My iron worker buddy brought me here a few years ago, and I am very thankful he did. This is the perfect example of the Cleveland breakfast diner. The menu is simple but Sal cooks everything to perfection. A typical egg, sausage, and hashbrown breakfast never tasted so good. Sal's also offers to put onions in your hashbrowns too, which in my opinion is the only way. The place is pretty tiny but I always seem to get a seat when I arrive."}
