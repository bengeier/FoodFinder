{"text":"This place is so yummy! Everything on the menu seems fresh and good. I always get the stuffed sweet potatoes and its delicious. the owners are very friendly and genuinely nice people. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very friendly and the food is great and on the healthier side. Not so healthy is the turkey bacon club sandwich which happens to be my favorite so far. Good food fast for a decent price."}
{"text":"I had the quinoa brown rice bowl with spinach stew. It came with a beautiful house salad loaded with cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, and feta-super fresh and yummy. The quinoa bowl was very nicely balanced with the earthy spinach and acidic dressing of herbs and onions. The gentleman that prepared my food provided excellent customer service. 
I would have given five stars but I didn't see a dessert; everyone knows that you have to follow up healthy with sweet and decadent."}
{"text":"Best gourmet sandwich shop in all of Las Vegas! Eat here regularly and have never had anything but 5 star service and eats! Working my way through the menu and can't wait to get to the gourmet hot dog. This place will throw a party for your mouth that you'll never forget! The service is 5 star too!"}
{"text":"Quick, healthy options, really good food and great service. I really enjoyed the chicken quinoa bowl, comes with a large side salad."}
{"text":"This place is so good! The food is fresh and pretty healthy for you and the customer service is wonderful! I don't know his name, but I always deal with the man and he is super pleasant and always friendly and willing to answer all of my crazy questions. 

As for the food. I'm addicted to their stuffed sweet potato. So much so that I make my own version at home, that's never quite as good, but still not bad. I could eat this dish once a week for the rest of my life and be perfectly happy. I've also had their brown rice bowl and was amazing at the portions! It lasted me two whole lunches and was just as good reheated. 

I cannot say enough about Gourmet Quick Bite. You won't regret eating here."}
{"text":"Fake chicken that taste like rubber.... Lots of food 5hat is not gourmet... Took 30 minutes to make inedible food.... What a joke!!! It's about as gourmet as chef boyardee"}
{"text":"I walked in this place right before work to get some food to go, didn't even know it was there, and right off the start, I got a great vibe from the place and the owner, who greeted me. This cafe is not your typical sandwich shop, it's super delicious and gourmet but still very reasonable prices. I had the steak sandwich and omg it was so good. Again, not the typical Vegas sandwich cafe. If you want great tasting, great looking food, this cafe is the spot. I also noticed how clean they keep the place, and noticed the class of the owner and employees and just the restaurant in general, which was another plus on their end. Just overall 5 I will be Coming to this spot on the regular for my grub."}
{"text":"Yay! My first review of the year!  so here's what we got: 1. Quinoa & Brown Rice bowl w/ the spinach stew (comes w/ side salad. 1. Acai bowl (these items are pictured). 1. Stuffed sweet potatoes (that everyone on here raves about). 1. Quinoa & Brown rice bowl w/ SALMON instead of chicken w/ house made dressing (comes w/ side salad). Everything came out to about $35.00 but the amount of food was beyond me. 

Ok, let me start off by saying this place SPECIALIZES in gourmet HEALTH FOOD.. So if you came here to order anything other I can't imagine it being up to parr w/ what they've advertised their main dishes to be. That being said! Everything was pretty good! If you're looking to start eating healthy for the new year this place has some options for you. The spinach stew bowl w/ chicken was good, a little tangy for my taste but still good & HEALTHY for you. Let me remind you, usually the things that have a bunch of sauce and FULL OF FLAVOR are most of the time, not good for you. The salmon bowl we got w/ the house dressing was a little DISAPPOINTING only because when we got back to the office- their wasn't any salmon in it! Wah... Wah.. Wahh....  but that's a-OK  people make mistakes...we all know that. As for the house made dressing choice we chose for the bowl- it was pretty good!! It's almost like a bernaise sauce!! I even took a little and tipped over my spinach stew ;)... BUT this probably isn't as health conscious as the other stuff. Lol 

I saved the best two for last!! The STUFFED SWEET POTATOES & the ACAI BOWL... *YUM*  I have to say, they are JUST AS GOOD AS THEY LOOK IN THE PICTURES... Try them... Seriously the best two items they have on the menu and, PERFECT! They're not that unhealthy at all! 

Ps. I am not one for chipotle sauce, AT ALL. I can taste it about a mile away... But in the stuffed sweet potatoes- you can hardly taste it as it's very very subtle and compliments the dish very well.. 

HAPPY YELPING!"}
{"text":"Name ONE other place in Vegas you can find stuffed sweet potatoes. What about quinoa bowls? Both on the same menu. I'll wait. Didn't think so! I have yet to find the potatoes elsewhere, and the bowls (both quinoa and acai) are large, filling, flavorful, and fresh.
 
Everything I've tried here has been excellent: the lentil soup is amazing, the potatoes make a great dinner, and the quinoa bowl is so huge it easily makes two meals.  I go significantly out of my way (nearly 30 miles round trip) to come here about once a week- the fact that they currently offer a Groupon is a nice perk, but the prices are so low you won't need one.

Quality is great, portions are huge and prices are fair, and the food itself is great. Service is friendly and attentive, and usually the owner himself is helping you. This spot has been open six months and I have no idea how it's not more popular, but it's easily one of my favorite healthy eating options in town- and for once they have more than just salads and grilled protein bowls! I am in love with this place."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been here several times in the past 10 days, love it.Today we had the sweet potato with chicken and cheese, a delightful dish that I wouldn't mind having again. Richard is such a nice guy and always makes sure we are set. It is a great spot to go to , we always hit it after the gym but anytime is good.Now that it is ultra hot outside,  the smoothies are a capital idea."}
{"text":"I called in my order and ordered the stuffed sweet potato. The man on the phone was very nice and helpful. I picked up my order about 10 minutes later and it was hot and delicious.  I would definitely get it again."}
{"text":"today was my 4th visit to Gourmet Quick Bite. I have tried their veggie bowl and lentil soup and of course the side salad. EVERYTHING is very tasty, healthy, clean, not oily, and filling. This is owner operated and the service shows it. Every encounter has been positive. I am so happy this little spot is now in 89120 and I wish them much success so I can keep coming for lunch! It seems that they really understand good, quality food. I am looking forward to trying their other menu items."}
{"text":"Outstanding home made and delicious food. Tasty fish tacos, gourmet cheese pizza, quinoa and brown rice. The drinks like the coconut amd pieapple are very nice and the berry acai mix is supereb! We'll be back for sure... Food is very addicting. Rana"}
{"text":"At pep boys this afternoon getting my tire fixed, picked up a nail & the tire got dry rot. So I decided to walk around & see what was close for lunch. So glad I did because I stumbled upon gourmet quick bite. Such a healthy & delicious looking menu. I got the stuffed sweet potato. With grilled chicken, spinach, white cheddar & their house chipotle sauce. Delicious!!! Also side note: found me a used book store in the plaza, I thought they were extinct in town"}
{"text":"This place is not that great, unless you just eat veggies. The meat is fake rubbery crap, there is nothing gourmet at this place. Another thing is it seems like it often empty, when we ordered our food it took forever to get"}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Very clean. Very courteous and polite. Not expensive. Portions are rather big. A sandwich shop with a European gourmet twist. Worth a shot."}
{"text":"Its our first time here... And i loved it! They have a very healthy menu. The service is awesome! I think he was the owner, very nice guy. The lentils soup was also very good. Its food you'll love. Very few times you go to a place where they have great service and great food. MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Owner Richard is really sweet and professional. Healthy food. They even have breakfast as well. Fresh Fruit cup with granola is highly recommended although the I'll try it on my next visit. The bread is organic as well."}
{"text":"One star..extremely nice and personable owners
One star..slammin acai bowls
One star..food is really tasty
BUT THEY CLOSE WHENEVER THEY WANT TO.
went here today at 3pm and they were already closed.."}
{"text":"Cutest little cafe! Really great food and great service. The owners run it, they're very sweet and personable. I ordered the Bulgarian flat bread and pineapple smoothie. Came up to less than $10, and it's food you feel good about eating. Yummy, fast, and cheap! Definitely will be coming back :-)

Update: they closed :-("}
{"text":"I went here for the 1st time for a quick lunch by myself, and let me tell you...I will be back! I wasn't feeling too well and was looking for a place that served a good soup. Their soup of the day was lentil and came with a slice of garlic bread. The soup had lentils, spinach, kale, onion, and lemon brewing at the front counter. The owner was very nice and explained how they made the soup as well as the other items on their menu. The owner even came outside and opened their umbrella so I could sit underneath and eat at the patio! Inside was very nice and I even saw a lady eating an acai bowl/cup which looked DELICIOUS! 

I'm giving 5 stars for the great food as well as the awesome customer service. The soup was very tasty as well as the slice of garlic bread (and I'm a very picky eater). None of the items had overpowering flavor and it was just enough for me! 

Thank you Gourmet Quick Bite!"}
{"text":"My best friend recently got married in Las Vegas. Like the geniuses that we are, we thought it be a great idea to host her 3 day bachelorette party the days immediately leading up to the wedding.
Spoiler alert- it wasn't the best idea we ever had.

Waking up the morning of the wedding, mascara smeared across my pillow and still wearing my  Britney Spears VEGAS BITCH shirt and spanx, I knew we needed a miracle to make it through this day.

The bride asked for one simple request: vegan parfaits. Spoiler alert part #2- those don't really exist anywhere except in my wildest dreams. I frantically scoured Yelp for a smoothie restaurant. Enter, Gourmet Quick Bite!

It's a short drive from the Strip and the have a variety of soups, wraps, etc. I was there for the smoothies and the acai bowls. The owner was super nice and friendly, and made the order as fast as he could. I am pretty sure they are only a 2 person operation, but he was not overwhelmed at all, nor scared off by my day 4 Vegas face. 

The smoothies were good, but the acai bowls were AMAZING! After drinking mainly vodka and diet coke for a few days it felt good to eat something that my body did not immediately want to reject.

Richard, thank you for saving the day! The bride and I thank you, and I am sure all her guests do too!"}
{"text":"Owner and his wife were very friendly and the food is great here! They really put in time and effort to make the food here, it's not just thrown together like most other places. Prices are reasonable! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"We look forward to having lunch at Gourmet Quick Bite.  This is a very Healthy Fast food 
restaurant.  We love the Bulgarian Cheese Flatbread Pizza and their salmon salad is
outstanding with wonderful lite dressing.  This is a lovely quiet restaurant and you
can have a good conversation with a friend. Richard the owner is so friendly.  He makes
you feel so welcome that you want to keep coming back..
After reading the other reviews, I can't wait to try the stuffed sweet potato.  Everything
looks so delicious and the benefit is it is healthy."}
{"text":"I didn't have much time to eat today so me and the lady decided to go here.  I'm glad we did.  This place is like a hidden gem.  I got a gourmet salmon salad and it honestly was the best salad I've had in awhile.  The best part about it is that is was healthy and quick.  The atmosphere was electric and they had some kind of upbeat jazz playing.  I assume the guy that that's behind the cash register is the owner.  He was super friendly along with the lady that made the food.  I see us coming back very soon and I will rule this place as the duke!"}
{"text":"It doesn't get much better than this. This multi-cultural mom-and-pop shop is phenomenal. The world needs more places like this. So far we've tried the house cream cheese flatbread, stuffed sweet potato, lentil soup, spinach stew quinoa bowl, peanut stew quinoa bowl, and the gourmet salads with chicken. Widely popular with the whole family. Can wait to try more. Please try this place and tell your friends and family -far too many small businesses like this go under just because people don't try them. Tell them Dale and Angela sent you!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat very good price I really recommend the quinoa bowl are very delicious plus health
My other favorite is the Acai bowl 
And the price is excellent"}
{"text":"When my wife and I first arrived we were greeted with a real smile, which to me started this great experience. They began to tell us about the menu and what was in it, which i thought was very informative. My wife ordered the hot dog with fries and i ordered the chicken fingers with fries. Now i'm a fan of Canes's when it comes to chicken fingers and their sauce is to die for, but this place i must say is the place i'm going to be going to since Cane's is some distance away. The fries were great and seasoned well. There were other things on the menu that I will be trying seeing all the other reviews of people that had a great time as my wife and I did. I do thou understand the concept of quick bite, because the portions were just enough to eat and go. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"What am I missing? All the reviews rave about all the food here. I mean, it's good, but I didn't have anything I'd write home about. I'd maybe come back and try an acai bowl or frappe in the summer.

I ordered the stuffed sweet potatoes, and friends ordered the Holiday Turkey panini, and the quinoa/brown rice bowl with spinach stew. 

The sweet potato was good - not sure what I was expecting, but it was good. I'm glad I shared it with friends and tried other items.

The Holiday Turkey Panini was just okay and it was small. I wouldn't order again. It was ordinary deli turkey and the bread overwhelmed the flavor of the sandwich. It's possible if they added more turkey it would improve the sandwich. 

The quinoa/brown rice bowl with chicken and spinach stew was pretty good and the best value for your money. The onion sauce they give you to put on top of the spinach made it. The chicken was bland, so ask for chili/hot sauce. It comes with a side salad and it compliments the dish well. 

Overall, this place is good for an inexpensive, quick bite."}
{"text":"We were in the area and stopped by for a healthy quick lunch. I'm so glad we came because I truly appreciated the quality and freshness of the ingredients, portion size and costumer service. Richard took care our order and was very friendly and made our food with special care! I ordered the salmon salad (which tasted so fresh and delicious). My husband ordered the brown rice quinoa bowl. Highly recommend you try this place out. The prices are unbeatable for all the food you get! In fact, considering the freshness and portion size, I think they can up the prices up a little more. You get even better portions here then at greens and proteins, and for a better price! Great place!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and I am very satisfied with not only the food but the customer service. I get a very simple sandwich and it is still one of the best sandwiches I have had. Not mention they have my favorite chips...garden salsa. The owner is very pleasant and I will definitely be back.  This is a must go for a quick lunch and healthy lunch!"}
{"text":"This place didn't look so appealing from the outside but when I came in and had the food it was amazing and fresh took me to a new world ! Get the Acai bowl !!! I'm coming back tomorrow for another."}
{"text":"Great little spot for lunch or an easy dinner before a movie at Galaxy!  
Nice find!!! Real food, fast. Thank you yelp."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a delicious meal with healthy options, this is the place to dine. The menu is very diverse, with unique items. You can get healthier fare, such as the delicious acai bowl, quinoa and brown rice bowl with your choice of protein, gourmet salad, chicken taco, and a stuffed sweet potato. If you are looking for other yummy dishes, you must try the gourmet hotdog, either of the two flatbreads, or choose from a wide variety of sandwiches. Their garlic bread is also wonderful. 
The owners are extremely friendly and will accommodate your personal tastes within reason. They sincerely want you to be happy with your choice, and have been very nice about making modifications to suit my personal taste, such as changing the protein choice in my salad, adding cheese, etc. Really, you owe it to yourself to give this establishment a try. It is very clean inside, plus there are so many options to choose from. Don't let \"Gourmet\" in their name scare you.  Their prices are very reasonable and the portions are great. Such a nice change from all of the chain restaurants and close to the airport, Sunset Park, Green Valley, etc."}
{"text":"I have been passing this restaurant by for some time and decided to try it today.  I am very impressed. 
I got a gourmet salad with chicken breast. One of the best salads l have had in a long time. Really fresh quality items. The lettuce was the best leaves out there. Every ingredient was fresh. The salad dressing was light, not oily and very tasty. 
The owners are the nicest people. I was given a free sample of their homemade lentil soup. It also was light and delicious. So much flavor and no guilt eating it. For the first time in a long time eating out was healthy and delicious beyond the regular fare offered. 
This will be my new place to enjoy often.  If you are into light healthy food full of flavor, this place is for you!"}
