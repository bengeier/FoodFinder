{"text":"The staff is very friendly & the place is decorated so cute. The spicy tuna sandwich was very good. They have a variety of craft & domestic beer, also very interesting moscato flavors. They prices are very reasonable & the food quality is great. I will definitely come back! The cupcakes ARE A MUST! We tried the peanut butter chocolate & the toffee caramel crunch! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches and burgers- my husband loves the ABC burger & I like the chicken wrap. The cupcakes are also delicious and creatively thought out, though I prefer slightly less icing personally. The building is very cute and has a nice ambience. Definitely a place to try for lunch if you haven't been."}
{"text":"So so good. I am NOT big on soup at all but like pickles and their dill pickle soup was beyond amazing. Possibly the best Reuben I've ever had. Service was excellent - nice atmosphere & staff. Carmel mocha cupcake was yummy too. Everyone should check this place out"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my lunch. Built my own burger salad. It was yummy. Nice fresh ingredients. Good beef patty. Fries look to be hand cut and real... but too well done for my taste. They have very creative pasta and potato salads will have to give them a try next time. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It's soooo cute and everyone is so nice. I've eaten here a couple times since it's opened at its new location and I've never been disappointed. There Ruben and the courthouse club are my fav so far and the soups have always been delish! I definitely recommend this place, it has the best lunch around!"}
{"text":"I've been to 2 Gals a couple of times now.  It's my new favorite place to grab a delicious lunch.  Let me start with the artichoke soup. Find this place on facebook and friend them.  If they tell you they're making artichoke soup you know your plans for lunch the next day.  Creamy and complex, made with fresh artichokes, potatoes, carrots, and dare I say a bit of bacon?  My only regret was not ordering two bowls of soup.  I've also had their bowtie pasta salad - yum.  It's creamy and cold.  It's exactly what I look for in pasta salad flavors   The tarragon chicken salad was a new take on chicken salad for me.  I really enjoyed the herby-tang that tarragon adds to,what could be, a traditional lunchtime favorite.  Yes Yes Yes to 2 Gals!"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant. Our favorite place to dine in downtown Concord. Very kid friendly but still quaint and great ambiance for adults to enjoy as well. I highly recommend the carrot cake cupcake for dessert is - it is the best carrot cake I've ever had."}
{"text":"Situated in a historic building the hubbub of downtown Concord, NC this place is fabulous.  Open for lunch hours of 12p -3p so plan your visit accordingly, the dining room fills up rather quickly.   Decorated very nicely and with what I thought was local artists work on the walls. There is a baby grand piano in the front window. The staff is attentive and friendly.  They menu has a variety of items from hot or cold sammys, burgers and wraps with something for everyone.  The prices are reasonable -  They offered several different homemade sauces to top the burgers including the usuals.  The sides we tried (homemade potato salad and the hand cut seasoned  French fries) were stop you in your tracks and say Wow good!!  The food is top drawer- You should go You should go"}
{"text":"My Mom and I tried \"2 Gals\" for the first time a couple days ago.  Mom had the San Diego wrap (slightly modified), and I had the ABC burger (slightly modified as well).   #highmaintenace :)  Food was exactly as ordered.  Our server, Melissa, was extremely attentive and anticipated our needs...a true sign of an exceptional server.  I was inquiring of some methodology on the preparation of the foods, etc., and before I knew it, the owner (Balinda) was answering all of our questions...not giving any sign of frustration with all of our questions...very impressed!  She even sent us home with complimentary Tomato Bisque soup as Mom has some restrictions and that's one of her favorites!  We are SO HAPPY to find an EXCELLENT restaurant in Concord, and plan to return soon (and tell all of our friends!)  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!   Chris C."}
{"text":"We stopped in here because we were in town for a high school game.  Had dinner and the ABC Burger was the best burger I've ever eaten.  Chips and Homemade Salsa were fantastic !!  Now hoping to find an excuse to get back to Concord !!!  Wish they would open their restaurant in the LKN area :)"}
{"text":"This place is great!  They have the best homemade soups and dressings. I just wish they had longer hours so I could eat there more."}
{"text":"Fantastic local stop with a great menu and atmosphere. The menu has a paleo section where you build your own salad. All of the dressings are homemade and delicious. Had the Oreo pie for dessert and it was out if this world yummy. Well worth getting off the interstate."}
{"text":"The decor is lovely and the food is amazing, my favorite is that ABC burger!! It is way too delicious! But unfortunately service is very slow!!"}
{"text":"This is a quaint little cafe in the heart of Concord.  They have a delicious assortment of food but my favorite is the vegetarian sandwich. The spicy beets are unbelievable and it is addicting!  Their soups are excellent and the service is very friendly.  This is an up and coming restaurant in Concord and I heartily recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Great food very healthy!! Always fresh and tasty. The menu is completely customizable to what you want. Great sauces and spreads. Soups are always outstanding! Staff is very friendly and helpful. This place is a great place to eat in downtown concord. Always remember to come in before 2 as things are made fresh daily and can be sold out. A few of my favorites are the ABC burger, Rocky Point wrap, seared chicken salad, the Monterey and big country and the Ruben is delightful and messy(: always get extra napkins!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! Every time I come here the service is always impeccable and my food is delicious! The every changing specials keeps the menu fresh and delightful! The burger and fries is always a favorite of mine! A lovely juicy burger on top of a skinny or brioche bun, followed by a huge helping of fries!! 2 Gals is quaint but full of personality!! You have to try them because you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love the food and the atmosphere.  The decor is beautiful.  Great place to go get a locally owned meal...Concord is full of chains and this is a nice option for those who support local business.  I have had their burgers and salads and have no complaints...food is always fresh and delicious.  My only complaint would be the hours... I wish they were open for supper (I heard this was coming as well as alcohol permit).  But if looking for a great breakfast/lunch place on the weekend this is my first choice.  The seating is fairly close to others so if taking my child I make sure we get a table towards the back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Not my favorite, kinda on the pricey side and the food was good but not outstanding... it's an ok restaurant and want to support local places but it's gotta be better then aaaaahhhhh!"}
{"text":"Fresh food friendly service great ambiance this is DEFINITELY a must try. ..you will be a regular in no time! !!!"}
{"text":"Quaint little restaurant with lovely ambience, very friendly & knowledgeable servers/staff, and delicious food! Well worth your money, and a drive out of the way (which we had done) :)"}
{"text":"If you are in the Concord area, stop by 2 Gals! It's always good!   The lunch menu is a collection of sandwiches and salads, including a make your own salad section. I almost always order the Veggie Delight sandwich, which is weird, but in the good way! It has just a crazy variety of items (like roasted potatoes and these amazing beets) but everything melds so well. You also get a hearty portion of the side of your choice. They also serve dinner and I think the menu changes often. For a while they were doing these large summer salads...they were AMAZING! It was a large, very fresh salad with two sides. So much food! They also have tasty veggie burgers. Overall, I think they have some of the most satisfying meat free options in downtown Concord.    Every time I visit the staff is kind and the food is fresh! I 100% recommend stopping by 2 Gals!   Also - save room for a treat from the Sweet Life!"}
{"text":"WOW...these gals know how to cook!  I ate there for the first time today for my birthday because my sister and niece had raved about it.  First of all the place is lovely and quaint.  I got the ABC Burger and let me tell you what, it was a taste explosion!  It had avocado, bacon, cheese and some other tasty sauce.  The burger was juicy, the bacon crisp and the avocado creamy and tasty.  I got a side salad with it and what made it pop was the homemade blue cheese dressing.  It was thick and chunky and perfect.  I got a cupcake for my birthday and I have actually had their cupcakes before and trust me they do not disappoint.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, great food isn't the only quality in a great restaurant. Inconsistent hours have made me bypass this delightful eatery when I'm hungry in Concord. I don't know what's going on with the business but along with some other Concordians, we are giving up on Two Gals."}
{"text":"Visited this super cute little cafe last Friday for lunch! Was very impressed with the ambiance and the menu. However, the service we received and overall friendliness of the staff was less than stellar. When we arrived, we were told there would be a 30 minute wait. We elected to wait and made our way to the restrooms in the interim. Both restrooms were clean and beautifully decorated but did not have soap. I informed a member of the waitstaff and she replied that, \"she would have to find them.\" Upon being seated at a table, we waited roughly 15 minutes before being greeted by our server. Service throughout our meal was not the best either. Our meals - ABC Burger and Spicy Chicken Wrap with Avocado - were absolutely wonderful.  I want to love this place so much!! Will give it a second try hoping they were having an off day."}
{"text":"Very impressive! I had the ABC burger with potato salad and was completely satisfied. Friendly staff and quick service. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of my favorite breakfast place in the Bay Area. Have eaten here a few times and everything is tasty and well made! They have the nerve to have a cupcake/dessert window to really take you over the top after you eat an amazing meal. Damn you, peach cobbler cupcake!!!! (Yeah, I ate it after having the PMS sandwich) You will want to try everything! If you love a tuna fish sandwich, you are gonna pass out on theirs. It is spicy goodness!!! I am SUPER picky about potato salad BUT I can devour theirs. One minus, the water is horrible. Has a nasty flavor. (Maybe they will switch to filtered or bottled) Other than that, good wine/beer selection. You will enjoy anything on their menu!!!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Order a cupcake to go because you'll be too stuffed after dinner."}
{"text":"Love this little place! The food is fantastic and the service is wonderful. The ABC burger, chips and salsa, and chicken salad are crowd favorites whenever we go. They serve beer and wine now so it has been come a go-to for brunch (and mimosas!). Can't wait to go for dinner as they expand their hours."}
{"text":"This is the only Yelp review I have ever done. But this place is so good I just had to. Everything I have had is great. But my favorite is the Veggie Delight sandwich! Great service too."}
{"text":"I want to give this restaurant 3.5 or 3.75 stars but giving a 4 so I don't bring down their average. This little restaurant is adorable.  A great little setting with a wonderful little bakery in the back where you can watch them decorate their cupcakes.    We went there a couple of times and ordered an array of food:  The Ruben, Venetian Dream sandwich, the Frisco, the Village Idiot, 2 Gals petite burger, ABC burger and the Jacked Up Birger.  We also ordered the Wedgy and the Chicken salad.  Notable dishes:  our favorite and \"go back to\" choices:  the Ruben, ABC burger and the Jacked Up burgers!  These are just plain yummy!  Oh!  And let's not forget the fries with smokey ketchup!    The side salads that come with the dishes are a choice of pasta salads.  Our favorite is May-ways salad. It had an Asian flair and is a little spicy.  We found the other side salads were heavy on the mayo and just typical pasta salad sides.   The reason I wanted to give them a 3.75 is the service is  slow and the chicken dishes and sandwiches are dry.  The lettuce salads are typical and the Wedgy is overwhelming and plain.   If you go with the Ruben or one of the burgers you will he coming back for more!! (Going there again this week!).  Great little restaurant addition to Concord's downtown area!  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great spot in charming downtown Concord.  I've been several times and have enjoyed everything I've ordered.  Be sure to test yourself to a cupcake or cookie....they're amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience! We celebrated a friends birthday here this past weekend and everything was amazing!! The food and service were the best I've had in a long time! Staff were so friendly! Keep up the great work! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!! Very happy every time we visit!!  Very fresh, and exceptional flavor!"}
{"text":"Wife, daughter and I just had lunch there for the first time, and it was great.  Small place with a lot of charm, and the food was wonderful.  ABC (Avacado, Bacon, and Cheddar) burger was cooked perfectly, and just messy enough to be a real burger.  Cheese and crackers and a fruit plate for my daughter (2), and a blackened chicken wrap for my wife, which she wants me to try and reproduce.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"I brought a friend to my favorite place in Concord today and is was awful!  I've introduced this place to at least 10 friends and today we both had something different and nothing seemed to work.  The bowtie pasta was cooked to almost paste and drowned in a tasteless liquid mayo.   I've had it before and it was wonderful.  Additionally, the table next us experienced the same thing AND had trouble with their check.... don't know for sure but the waitress (not our waitress but another I've had in the past) would not honor a coupon.  Please oh Please 2 Gals, address your problems... I LOVE your restaurant and can't wait for dinner service to begin but with 4 meals served today there was a problem with every one of them as well as the table next to us."}
{"text":"This is not only a lovely setting in a historic building but the food and service were outstanding.  The special for tonight was barbecue chicken, loaded mashed potato, corn on the cob, yeast roll and salad with home made dressing!!! So good!  There was live piano music that always sets the right ambiance!  The desserts were wonderful too Carmel cheese cake and mega brownie!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Cute shopping plaza with outside seating. Inside seating is crowded and extremely limited. Despite posted hours, they are closing at 2 today. Despite posted menu, soups are out of season. My vegetarian sandwich took about 10 minutes on a day with fairly steady business. As I waited I noticed fresh herbs in the kitchen and a bucket of dog biscuits outside.  Looking at the sign above the door, I thought, \"yes, this is yum!\"  The sandwich far exceeded my expectations. The layering of flavors, textures, and sauces was right on. Nice sandwich!"}
{"text":"Super cute cafe. Love the decor it's like a doll house. Lots of cupcakes on foto of their regular menu. You can even see the staff make the cupcakes through a window. The food was delicious and service was quick and friendly staff. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times and always go back for my favorite: veggie delight sandwich and crab salad.  The crab salad has got a nice kick to it, so if you're not into spicy, this may not be for you.  But here's the clincher...I'm not a spicy-type gal and I STILL love it!  Their cute bakery offers a variety of cupcakes and bars of which I've tried several and have never had one I didn't like.  So if you're tired of fast food chains and want fresh food at a reasonable price, \"2 Gals\" needs to be your \"go-2\"!  Great atmosphere, live piano player on occasion is a nice touch, and decor is lovely.   So good!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, relaxing atmosphere, and friendly accommodating staff. My wife and I enjoyed our first visit and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! My first trip here. The first thing that impressed me was how friendly the staff was. Made me feel they they were really glad I was there. I had the Ruben. I have had Rubens in 20 different cities and probably over 150 restaurants. All that I can tell you is that they all fall short of the Ruben at 2 Gals. The greatest enemy of any Ruben is damp bread and bland sauce. 2 Gals has perfected the art of making a Ruben and has elevated it from a mere sandwich to a culinary work of art! GREAT JOB 2 Gals!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a terrific casual meal at 2 Gals last Saturday. We started with the baked brie appetizer the fresh fruit that came with the cheese was tasty. We had 3 different entries each was perfectly prepared. The price for dinner for 3 with a great beer and 2 excellent cocktails was just under $50. The service was great.  How do you beat that?  WLM, Wilmington, NC"}
{"text":"Excellent little place, we found it just days after opening their new location. Food was delicious and had a great combination of flavors. Everything was made fresh, and you could taste it. Everyone was friendly and service was on point.  Next time I pass through Concord, I will definitely visit 2 Gals again."}
{"text":"This place is definitely top in the area.  It's a cheap sandwhich restaurant that is nice enough for dinner as well.  The PMS, is better than it sounds.  It's a pastrami, mustard, and swiss masterpiece.  There are 10 other sandwiches on the burger that sound amazing so it's hard to pick.  The special is usually interesting.  The last time we went we split a cup of the dill pickle soup.  It was extremely tasty, to the point where I wouldn't even want a whole bowl.  The only gripe I have is the crab pasta has switched to mostly celery and very little crab (albeit imitation).  It was so good the first time I had it I'm convinced the celery doesn't work at all in the dish."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat at in Concord. If you havent tried 2 Gals, I recommend you try it. Sooo delicious!!! My favorites are the rocky point and Monterey"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. As health conscious New Yorkers, we were a little taken aback all the BBQ and chain restaurants- 2 gals was a breath of fresh air. Great tea service, gluten free options, and most importantly, still yummy, memorable, satisfying food.  Those pita chips!!! Plus big high five to the Jasön products in the ladies room. Only one star missing for the slightly awkward seating where the restaurant was wide open and we were placed next to someone still doing opening chores (we came in just at opening)... It didn't really feel like we should be seeing that yet, or that they were ready for us."}
{"text":"Love this place the Tarragon Chicken salad is my fav on one of the big Croissants, also the Big Country is wonderful. My husband loves the homemade chips and salsa."}
{"text":"2 Gals Kitchen is conveniently located in historic downtown Concord across the street from the Cabarrus County Courthouse, so on weekdays expect a professional crowd. The décor is pretty typical of a \"Main Street\" style eatery...overly cutesy and a bit contrived.  As for the food, it's hit or miss. My favorite is the spring salad...fresh strawberries, spring mix, caramelized pecans (although the pecans are always a bit on the burnt side), and an AMAZING raspberry vinaigrette. I am tempted to give it a four-star rating just for this so-good-you-want-to-drink-it vinaigrette, but I have to be fair.  The Asian-style cold pasta salad sounds promising, but it's overly spicy, likely to compensate for the weird peanut-y dressing.   The fries are really good though! Sliced thin with the skin-on they are the perfect balance of greasy and crispy and totally delicious. If you find yourself at 2 Gals, definitely order some fries.  The restaurant also has an array of salads, sandwiches, and wraps and is a real Concord favorite. But remember, Concord is mostly fast-food and family chains, so the standards aren't too high."}
{"text":"Wow!!  A first class restaurant right here in my little town!!!  I had the Fresco sandwich.  It was great.  You can choose from one of their homemade salads.  I had their potato salad.  I can't say enough about this place!! Give it a try!!  You will love it!!!"}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant! We had dinner with family here and really enjoyed it. The burgers were juicy and flavorful. I had a side salad with the homemade blue cheese dressing. It had huge chunks of cheese, which I love. Shared a homemade twix cookie bar with my son, despite being on a diet. It was well worth the splurge."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a great lunch here with a friend. My roast beef sandwich and home made potato salad was great. My friend raved about her burger. Great service. We got sweets to go. Loved them. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've only ever been to 2 Gals for breakfast before, which they don't technically do anymore. But it was delicious! They focus more on lunch service now, I believe.  All of the staff is really wonderful and during our meal the chef even came out to make sure everything was good. They really give you the small town feel and they are definitely doing the food right. It's worth the trip to downtown Concord to give this one a try."}
{"text":"Doucebag: an obnoxious or contemptible person, typically a man.   If you visit Concord NC this place I will assure you will be a nice surprise. The comfortable shabby chic environment with friendly staff will be trying to help you out as much as possible. I have been here two time now, enjoying the chicken wrap with a little spice. In the back section you will find a bakery where they have cupcakes on displayed.   If you think your some big time city food critic, please go walk off a cliff. This is for realistic people looking for something new and amazing. This is the place for a great lunch, please browse the menu online and photos real people have posted.   The DOUCHBAG that gave 1 star without even trying the food or the snotty nose princess who believed this was beneath her. Well I wouldn't take their advise, who knows what their palate would really enjoy.   It's nice coming into a small town for a meal and meeting a great staff."}
{"text":"I think I may be in love with this place!!!  I have been visiting Lori at The Sweet Life for years, and a few years ago she joined up with 2 Gals and serves her bakery items here.  (Best bakery in this area hands down!!!). So teaming up with this restaurant was a killer idea, and everyone can get some amazing desserts after their meal!  I visited with a friend and my 1.5 year old son.  Not much for kids, I'll say that...I got him some fries.  Both my friend and I got the Rocky Point wrap.  It was DELICIOUS!  Spicy though- so watch out.  The fries were great, though!  There's a few wrap choices which is an awesome bonus.  So many side options too- green salad, pasta salads (didn't love my Asian one) soups, chips.  So many!  Cute lunch spot but they do dinner as well.  Check out their hours.  I'd like to go back real soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is delicious. The service is fantastic. The owners are active in making your dining experience wonderful. This place is a yes, yes and yes."}
{"text":"Beautiful quaint restaurant with delicious food. Staff is very friendly and helpful. They are also involved in the community with a heart to give back. Highly recommend to get away from the chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. I love that they change the dinner menu weekly and use all fresh foods. Mary, one of the owners, came around to chat and see how everything was. This place has a great atmosphere, friendly staff, and delicious food! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"So cute little lunch spot. Fills up quick so come early or you may have a wait. Dining area is decorated super classy and chic with a touch of shabby. Very comfortable atmosphere. Staff was very pleasant.  I got a cold wrap that had corn chicken and zucchini in it. Very filling and refreshing. Everything tasted super fresh. As my side I got the potato salad and OMG it could have possible been the best potato salad ever. My lunch companions both got burgers. One with potato salad as well and the other with fries. The fries are hand cut and fried to perfection. A true fry lovers dream. They don't even need sauce/ketchup.  The burgers were very well dressed and both were very pleased with their lunches.  If you find yourself in the area stop in it is definitely worth waiting for if they are busy."}
{"text":"Very small place the steak I had was awesome and very tasty sides. Friendly staff and a hidden gem."}
{"text":"The best place for lunch in Concord!! I've had nearly everything on the menu and all has been spectacular!  I recommend highly to all my friends and people I meet. My favorite sweet is the cinnamon roll!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal for lunch today. What a great combination of freshly cooked fair and then finish it off with a cupcake from the Sweet Life."}
{"text":"Great lunch location.  I had the Jacked Up Pepper Burger, and my wife had the Frisco sandwich.  Both were very tasty and well presented.  We were also surprised how full the place was at 1:30 p.m. on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Never knew this place existed until co-workers ordered from here yesterday. I had the Big Country for lunch. It was great. I think I found a new place....AND it's close to work! :-)"}
{"text":"I can't say all I would like to say about this little place. I will say that my wife and I came a good distance to try it and I am so glad we did. The fish tacos were some of the best I have ever had and it was my wife's first time having them period. That will ruin it for her trying them anywhere else because I know. It will be very had to beat what she had tonight. Everything? was very fresh from the chips & salsa (home made in house) to the Cream cheese brownie and Chocolate peanut butter cupcake (made in house). We have found out little spot of food heaven. I would recommend anyone to come give them a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Super fresh and of flavor!  Had the rocky creek wrap which was delicious.   Tons of homemade desserts too!  I travel all over SC and NC as a sales person and I always take time to stop in here when I'm in town.   It's the best home made food in concord,NC"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place on a lunch break for the first time. Had the NY sandwich and wouldn't hesitate to order again. Cannot wait to give the rest of the menu a try. High recommend."}
{"text":"It's ok, the problem is its *only* ok. Arrived 2.00 on a Saturday and they were out of soup, fries, burgers and tuna. Service people seemed overwelmed and confused. Our meals lacked flavor, service terrible.  Only offered tea refills when paying the bill too late to wash down food."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming for lunch weekly since they re-opened at the new location in downtown Concord.  The food is always fresh, flavorful, and high quality.  Favorites are the ABC burger, hand made fries, potato salad, pasta salad and Frisco Sandwhich.    Today we tried their new breakfast menu.  It was hands down the best breakfast in Concord.  Their chorizo burrito, grits, and sausage gravy were the best we have had since moving to North Carolina.  The staff is always friendly and the owners frequently come by the tables to greet diners.  The menu is high quality and the food is great.  They make the food fresh daily so I recommend coming early!"}
{"text":"I wish every town I visited for work had this menu, thank you for providing great options!   I stopped in here for lunch and got the full seared chicken salad. I was happily surprised it came on a bed of spinach, three pieces of thin chicken pieces- plenty to fill you up- some corn, fresh avocado, tomatoes and this AMAZING salad dressing I wish I could bottle up.   They had a great menu filled with sandwiches and salads for all kinds. Also, they had a good looking wine list which I wish I could have participated in. The layout of the restaurant is pretty much concentrated in the main room, while take out orders happen in the back.   If you like clean eating and really awesome looking desserts this is an ideal stop."}
{"text":"They have an absolute amazing vegetarian sandwich. The combination of flavors may sound odd, but it all pairs so perfectly together! My husband has gotten other sandwiches and sides... everything is tasty!! Such a cute spot too just to have coffee and OH one of their delicious cupcakes"}
{"text":"The freshness of the food is divine! The chicken salad was so amazing I literally wanted to lick my plate (I didn't bc I am already weird enough). I also have the pickiest 2yr old that barely touches anything and he ate every single bite of a delicious fruit yogurt parfait. I can't wait to go back and try some more of their delicious food. I love that the owner came out and sat down at our table and was genuinely down-to-earth and very kind we will be regular patrons"}
{"text":"Very nice little place in downtown Concord. The sandwiches are great, cupcakes delicious, and fries were exactly what we were hoping they'd be when ordering.   The service was super friendly, and we'll be back for sure.   About the only negative from our experience was the crab pasta side was just too spicy and I'm kind of sad I wasted my time with it (couldn't eat it at all) as I would have rather just ordered even MORE fries!"}
{"text":"I meet a friend for lunch here today the place is very unique very friendly staff. You walk in they had a Pianist playing christmas songs. The menu looked great i ordered their ABC burger (avocado/bacon/cheese). I was disappointed the burger was well well done it wasn't juicy like a burger should be.  For me there was to much mustard but than i kept tasting alot salt. I finally figured it out the menu said seasoned avocado I missed that Mmm leave the avacado alone its a great add without a Ton of salt. The fries were good  They also have a small bakery case looked amazing i ordered the Double chocolate one with Ganache in the middle. Another disappointment  the cupcake was dry an icing hard with a lump of ganache in the middle. I think it was refrigerated which would be why it became dry an the ganache wasnt melt in your mouth smooth n creamy goodness. You know it was such a cute place Id give them another try. The place is small but their tables are to large for the space if theyd get smaller tables more customers could be seated. However my friend ordered the  chicken club she said it was good with pita chips an salsa. Ill return but if your in the concord area try it"}
{"text":"Prior to our visit I called and asked if there were any gluten free options other then just salad. The nice lady explained all the choices. So my daughter and I went for lunch and it was beautifully designed and decorated. We were greeted by a sweet lady. Served by Lindsey who explained all gluten free menu options and was very patient with the questions for all my many food intolerances. Also sharing a personal story about her being gluten free as well. As for me Today is my birthday and I was able to get a gluten free carrot cake cupcake, it was sooo good! My lunch was a spicy tuna melt on gluten free wrap with a side salad and tasty homemade ranch that's got its own twist and so good. My daughter who's not diet challenged ate the union burger and fries and red velvet cupcake for dessert. I spoke with the manager and explained how we will be back bc of our positive experience and how much it meant to me bc of all the health problems I've been going through. The manager was so sweet and shared a personal story and was so genuine. The atmosphere in this restaurant was like stepping back in time, not one person was on their cell phone, just people hanging out enjoying people! Awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Abc burger is amazingly delicious, perfect blend of ingredients on a toasted bun.. Fruit as a side is fresh, sweet and drizzled in a savory citrus sauce.. Servers are sweet and polite.. Ambiance is charming.. Local artist display their work tastefully.. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Sweet little dinner with killer cupcakes. I started with iced tea, half and half. The server was honest when I asked if the tea was super sweet. I ordered the Monaray Wrap with crap padta...heaven slightly spicy butt I would call it flavorful. Cupcakes to go!"}
{"text":"These ladies know how to do it! And by do it I mean cook, serve, bake, be friendly and courteous and all around sweethearts! Went to dinner last night and thoroughly enjoyed the whole evening. I would highly recommend enjoying an evening in downtown concord and having dinner here."}
{"text":"This is a cute unique place to have breakfast, lunch and dessert.  They also serve dinner on saturdays.   Everything is fresh.  The menu options are unique. Prices are great.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Visited this place about a week ago with my aunt while she was in town. We dropped by on a Wednesday for lunch, they weren't overly busy so we were seated right away. I was a little surprised by the nice table cloths, but pink plastic cups, but the food speaks for itself. I had the tuna melt sandwich which isn't typical at all! It has a nice spicy kick to it, just enough to wake up your tastebuds. I also had May-Ways pasta salad on the side and it is pleasantly Asian inspired with a kick of its own. Service was great, our waitress was very attentive and friendly. I will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"My sister and I stumbled upon this cute little kitchen while walking around downtown Concord. We stopped in for lunch and both got HUGE salads. The menu had tons of healthy options with fresh veggies and yummy sandwiches. While we were there, I also noticed a bakery corner with lots of cupcakes and pies. I ended up ordering a dozen cupcakes for a friends baby shower and was very happy with how they turned out. Leslie was so friendly and easy to work with, the cupcakes looked and tasted fantastic, and they were reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I am very new to town, so I found myself exploring and trying new restaurants in the area. I found this place while walking around downtown and I have to say this place is amazing. The service was great! I felt horrible that I came in about thirty minutes before closing, the owner told me not to worry! The food was fresh and hot and quick too! I had the ABC burger and I would definitely suggest it to any first timers you enter this establishment!   I heard their cupcakes are amazing, yet I didn't have time to try them. Maybe next time.  I can not wait to bring my friends and family there"}
{"text":"This will be a short review. Look on Yelp and decode to try an new spot. Drive across town to get there before they close. Pull up and they decided to close 45 minutes early. Why? Well I'm sure your guess is as good as mine.   I'm sure my rating will go up in time. Once I'm able to try this place. I won't go out of my way though the next time."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. We work in the area and walk to this place often downtown Concord. Always gotta get a cupcake before you leave, you won't be disappointed. We even saw the Avett brothers eating in there."}
{"text":"Love this place!  So glad it is in downtown Concord.  I have never had a bad meal here and the service is great.  Make sure to take a peek in the bakery window....I gained 5 pounds just looking at the cupcakes!"}
{"text":"These gals are doing some amazing things and are definitely raising the bar for restaurants in downtown Concord, which has needed a shot in the arm for a while. This unique place has a great menu of fresh choices. The service is always great and the atmosphere is warm and quirky. Favorite item-- the ABC burger. Only critique-- I wish they opened before 6pm for dinner on Fri & Sat. Otherwise amazing!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are unique and tasty.   Decor is a charm but the best part is the  cupcakes!!  Tried them all when the owner approached me on the street with two boxes of gourmet treats.  It was like winning the baked goods lottery!   That random act of kindness made fans of me and a covey of cupcake lovers that indulged in those yummy treats."}
{"text":"I stopped by one of my favorite downtown Concord eating spots (2Gals Kitchen) for lunch and as usual everything was delicious!  Linda is a wiz in the kitchen and she used her magic to get me to eat pickled beets on a burger and to my surprise I enjoyed every bite!  The staff are always friendly and very accommodation but I did miss Mary's beautiful smile and witty personality with my meal!   Do yourself a favor and grab a yummy treat from the onsite bakery to take home, but get more than one because it's too good to share!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area so today was our first time here. It was absolutely delicious. The menu has various options which was nice, and the service was great!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Heard of this delicious spot and finally I made it in for a bite to eat. Perfect for a date or family get together(they have a separate room for large parties). Our server was extra friendly and the food came out promptly. In the attached photo is the ABC burger with LIGHT Zesty Ranch."}
{"text":"Yes, come here for all the Southern comfort food! I was lucky enough to come here for dinner for a special event, and the owners were kind enough to open just for us on a Monday night!   We were brought an assortment of appetizers including salsa with amazingly seasoned pita chips, brie cheese with fruit, and these delicious fried egg rolls (honestly, I'm not quite sure what was in them but they were absolutely delectable, especially with the dipping sauce).  For my entree, I opted for the special: barbecue chicken, corn on the cob with (lots of) butter, mashed potatoes with cheddar and thick pieces of bacon. Needless to say, very filling and very buttery all around.  The chicken had a great kick to it and was not too dry for being chicken breast.  For dessert, I had to get a red velvet cupcake.  I have nothing bad to say about it, and only great memories of trying not to eat it too quickly so I could enjoy how moist and amazing the cupcake was, perfectly matched with a sweet cream cheese icing."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch, friendly staff that treated my team like family. Had the union burger the flavor was great with fries was just a great overall my friends had the phily and the other had the wrap both cleaned their plates I will keep this on my radar when I come back to this customer"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here for the first time last week while visiting my daughter and loved it!  Super cute decor and the food was delicious.  Our service was good... no complaints which others seem to have a problem with.  I will definitely go back and would love to try their breakfast which I hear is amazing!!"}
{"text":"I am on vacation and found this place on Facebook.. It was by far the best best place that I have eaten at in the days that I've been here..fresh food.. And good expensive  food for a bargain.. I would easily pay double for the food I got today..amazing gem of a find in concord..Yummy sandwich and veggy soup that hit the spot! My body is happy- thank you!"}
{"text":"ABC burger and Petite burger shown. So good! I had to ignore the flowery plate, but the burger was awesome and crab pasta as well. I tastes the petite burger and it was tasty too!  Live piano music played while we ate. I highly recommend."}
