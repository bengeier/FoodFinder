{"text":"If I could give them less than a one I would! Food took over an hour to come out and when it did it was DISGUSTING and cold! The server checked on us maybe once and when she came
To take our orders and drink orders we had been sitting there for 45 minutes already unattended! She had a bad attitude and gave me an expired soda. Never again!"}
{"text":"El Entronke Mexican Foood, is a new restaurant that opened about 4-5 months ago. It's owned by a local couple. The food is amazing. I go there once a week or even sometimes two. There food is airways fresh. It's not greasy like other places I have been. Believe me I know. Growing up in a Mexican family, we get to grow up very picky with our food. The staff and owners are always great. When football season comes around this will be the place to go and have some great food and great cervesas. I recommended. Food price is very moderate. Not expensive. The gevos rancheros are delicious and so is the chorizo plate. Burritos are fresh no grease. You have to go to this place.."}
{"text":"My mom & i decided to try this new place. We ordered to go. When we got home, my torta was missing. So i went back & the dumb waitress has a bad attitude saying it was with my order & I was lying.... Told ME not to have a attitude.. So i asked her to speak to the owner, saying i didnt think the owner would appreciate her talking to a paying customer so rudely. So the owner come out, looks at me like im dumb & says \"ok. I'll talk to her\" like she really didnt care about my problem. I will take my business elsewhere. I don't recommend this restaurant. My moms red chile burrito tasted like the meat was dried out. My torta was good, what i could eat of it after they ruined my appetite..... SO RUDE!!! They need to teach their employees how to act. Not good for business."}
{"text":"Delicious  food and great friendly  Service!!! Authentic Mexican food with that great Chihuahua taste, The Frijoles charros were delicious, that was an added treat given before your food, I defiantly recommend this place, I love it, I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat in the South Phoenix area, good food, good prices, great drinks, helpful staff, good music, fun place to eat and have a drink, thumbs up"}
{"text":"Great decor, I believe it's  family owned. The salsa was good, chips were average. The food was delicious. I'm only giving  three stars as the service needs improvement. I think they are overwhelmed  but do hope management gets it soon. The green Chile chimichanga was on point. Will definitely give it another try."}
{"text":"Nicer inside than you may expect.  Beautifully clean.  Friendly faces.  Only one thing wrong, the food was perhaps a little pricier than expected and was good... Not great.  Maybe we hit it in a bad night but I certainly have had better for the money."}
{"text":"Service was ok.  Music is way too loud. The lighting is too bright. They were out of most beers we requested. But the food was good. I would come back but only if ponchos is too crowded."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant , food comes out really quick and everyone looked very satisfy and happy . I ordered to go , now I can't walk of how full I am . The owners were here , very friendly couple . Don't forget to order a michelada ! The bartender knows how to make the best ones !!! Yummy!"}
{"text":"New restaurant on the south side. We had decided to try out for breakfast. Food is good  and price is reasonable.  I had the chiliquitas  and my guy had the large pesola. Both dishes were good..not to hot or bland good size portions . I would  go back."}
{"text":"You really can't state one dish may be better than another, it just proves that there are so many great dishes here!  Almost everything tried to date is pretty darn good!  If you really understand that there are so many so called 'REAL' Mexican food joints to be found in the Phoenix area, then you'll appreciate the fact that in the voluminous competition around, it is very hard to make comparisons.  Between their moderate prices, ambience, quality and taste - El Entronke stands out big time.  Although tastes are different, we are sure the home-style and non-hybrid intent of the owners and staff make this eatery a winner!  The advantage of El Entronke (the Crossroads) is that it keeps its hominess and down to earth menu in an environment where the competition is relentless.  Our kudos for both tastes offered and survival.  We'll keep going back to enjoy their eats.  Highly recommended and Bon appétit at El Entronke from Gástro Ecléctico!"}
{"text":"I am definitely a regular to this restaurant and for good reason! I love the neighborhood/family environment but I love the food even more! Everything always come out fresh and presentable. The waitresses are always kind. The only caution I would give is this place can get a little loud. If you are looking for a quiet dinner; this is not the place. Other than that..... 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"Super clean, good environment, best hot dogs in south phoenix , great well drinks!, owners are always available to help you"}
{"text":"First time stopping in! Waitresses were very friendly and considerate! Ordered fajitas to share and it was not quite enough to split but still very tasty! Festive music but not too loud. We give them a thumbs up!"}
