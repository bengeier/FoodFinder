{"text":"OK food, OK service, OK value, OK place.  In the competitive restaurant market it might not be enough to recommend.  I didn't know they specialized in barbecue from the name/appearance, so there are a couple of obvious gaps in the menu to accommodate (e.g. no grilled chicken sandwich?)  Also our experience was marred by annoying circus in the next booth over.  Elderly couple seemed to be complaining about everything, resulting in multiple visits from managers and kitchen staff.  It's a small issue, but they can't let one difficult customer interfere with service to others."}
{"text":"OMG! Best brisket ever! First I was offended that they didn't give me a steak knife, but it was breaking off just with my fork! So soft and tender. Yum! Mac and Cheese was not plain either. It had a nice spice to its traditional comforting taste. Their meatloaf with garlic mash potato is fantastic too! Their comfort food marketing label is absolutely correct and will not disappoint you when you need it! I'm dragging my family back here for July 4th for their 25% off all BBQ special! Ask for Jamel who made our time there very special even though we walked in there with flip flops and shorts."}
{"text":"This was a surprise. The outdoor seating in the room was great. The service attentive, efficient, but not in your face. The ribs and lobster rolls great..and their drink pours generous..it is an all thumbs up kind of place."}
{"text":"Any new restaurant is going to have growing pains whether management is new to the business or not. I didn't experience that here, though. They are still expanding their seating areas and the main patio will soon be covered. Expect it to be busy and that they may have slight issues with seating until things get rolling! I ordered the pork shoulder which was excellent. I ordered the cornbread and BBQ chips as sides and unfortunately the cornbread still had an hour to cook, so hopefully I'll get to try that next time. The seasoning on the BBQ chips was tasty, but I prefer my chips to be a little less browned. My husband ordered a burger which was huge. Service was fast and our food arrived quickly, and we thought they were large portions for the cost. Our first experience was great and will be back. They're just getting started!"}
{"text":"Today was our fourth visit. Would have rated it higher based on earlier visits. Today my brisket was dry and not as flavorful as previous visits. My wife's Cubano was good as a pulled pork sandwich but missed the complexity of a more traditional Cubano. My side salad was great, but the beans were tepid."}
{"text":"Visited 2nd time between 3-5p, when there is a limited bar menu. Cant sit in booths during this time is the only negative. Menu is fine, a selection of a dozen apps/burger/ribs. Food excellent as before, server/bar folk still very friendly and attentive. This is now our go-to restaurant in the carefree area."}
{"text":"This has been our go to place since they opened! If you haven't tried the wings yet, you are missing out! We went in on Friday for dinner and along with the wings tried the special for the night, smoked prime rib - it was fantastic. Please add to the menu :) The service here is always great and Friday night was no different, Jamel was great and I'm so happy he recommended the special. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great service.   Friendly atmosphere. Nice outdoor area as well as comfortable seating inside. I had the 1/2 chicken which was smoked and flavorful. There's 2 community tables so be prepared to share a meal with strangers if the regular tables are filled."}
{"text":"Thursday review. I went for the live jazz and wine down Wednesday and had lots of fun. The Chef special was a poached citrus salmon and it was wonderful. Just wanted to update everyone on the great evening had by all. We will absolutely be back. I hear breakfast is good too. Not many good breakfast places in Surprise with a full menu like the Station has. See you soon."}
{"text":"Wife and I had a diner reservation on 10/8/2017 at 6 PM. We were seated right away. Several other people came at about the same time so I was not expecting how fast our food came out! We had the pulled pork sandwich and I'd recommend it. Our waiter, while attentive, was a little over the top with the french he was using. We asked us twice if we wanted desert...so it's obvious he was not listening when we said no the first time. Both of us thought  he was annoying."}
{"text":"A fantastic addition to an otherwise lackluster restaurant scene in the Carefree area. Happy hour, cocktails and service well above average.  Yummy pulled pork, corn bread, salad. Indoor/outdoor bar, plenty of misters and a patio fireplace. Looking forward to brining friends back for dinner."}
{"text":"I can't even explain how much I love this place! The food is amazing, the atmosphere is wonderful and the staff is top notch! If you are lucky enough to get Kendra as your waitress, you have hit the jackpot! You will feel like you have a new friend. Super professional and extremely friendly at the same time. Also a big shout out to Casey at the bar! Always looks happy to be at work! Love this staff! Kudos to Paul, the owner for bringing this amazing place to our little corner of the Valley."}
{"text":"Visiting the area...Was planning on stoping by after I visited the nearby salon.... HOWEVER.......!!!! I will Never return!!!! Since there we NO cars out front I thought it would be okay if I parked in front of the restaurant, run over to the salon (make an appointment) and stop by the restaurant for a bite to eat and a beer. After some lady from the restaurant attempted to repremand me for parking in front, I will not return. And her attitude of \"I could care less if you were planning on coming here\" was enough for me to write this. I believe our exact exchange of words were...  ME: \"I won't be eating here.\"  Crazy parking lady: \"Thats fine by me!\"  Horrible customer service! Watch out for the crazy parking lady!!"}
{"text":"Good wholesome food served in a friendly, casual atmosphere.  I love the fact that the owners are very \"visible\" in this establishment, both \"on the floor\" and  \"in the back\". Burgers are great, and the ruben is to die for!  It's a pity that I never have room for desert because I heard that they have an award winning Key Lime Pie! Good food, good service, reasonable prices - what more could you ask for!"}
{"text":"First time here. The food was great. Great service. Loved the atmosphere. The chocolate cookie dessert was awesome. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"It was Friday night in surprise and most of the restaurants were packed.  I remembered seeing some flyers for this restaurant at my work and figured we would give it a try.  We arrived at a very very empty restaurant which again for Surprise on a Friday night is not normal and probably not a good sign.  We walked in and there was one couple eating and the rest of the place was empty.  We stood at the door where a host or someone should have been and no one was there.  We waited about 10 minutes and nobody showed up to seat us.  Therefore we left.  I would have liked to have tried this place, i appreciate that they came to my place of work to promote the restaurant, but I guess they were too busy serving their empty restaurant to seat us.  No wonder the place was empty."}
{"text":"Wonderful smoked pork, brisket, meatloaf sandwich, sweet potato fries. Are you kidding me--- only place in town to go for barbecue and smoked meat. Yummm. Excellent customer service, great atmosphere. Never a bad experience."}
{"text":"Excellent Service, food was amazing. Had the brisket grilled cheese and the tomato soup was so good. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I went to Liberty Station for an early dinner and had a great experience. We had our 3 kids and were immediately engaged by the ownership/management. A family owned and operated restaurant. The food was great and kids stuff came out really quickly. We will be going back often!"}
{"text":"Liberty Station has been on my list to try, so we finally did yesterday, it did not disappoint! The hubby and I split the BBQ platter, so could try 3 meats. The brisket was so tender you didn't need a knife, it was our favorite! The ribs were our 2nd favorite, tender and flavorful, no need to add BBQ sauce. The pork shoulder was tender as well, but we didn't care for the sauce on it. The sides we chose were winners also! The mac n' cheese with green chilies, which I thought would be overpowering, was not at all and was quite tasty! The boston baked beans were thick and not runny, with chunks of brisket, another winner with me. The final side was honey butter cornbread, should be called corncake! It was a light and moist cornbread, definitely not your dense and dry cornbread most places call cornbread. The place is not very large inside and has two patios. One has a fireplace that seems like a good place for a nice evening dinner, when it's not monsoon season! There are many other menu items besides BBQ that we are wanting to try. This is definitely a keeper on our list of places to eat."}
{"text":"Tried it a few times. Nothing too good nor bad to say. But we will be back to try it again. Happy to have a new place to add to our rotation of going out to eat."}
{"text":"We just had another wonderful experience at Liberty. This time for happy hour. The pork tacos, brisket quesadilla, tots and shrimp were all very good with large hh portions. This is our 4 the experience in 21 Days and the staff and food have been excellent each visit. It is our go to bar/restaurant. BBQ IS WXCELLENT."}
{"text":"So, I came here with my husband the FIRST time in April on the referral of a friends father.  The conversation went a little like this \"You're from Boston right?  awesome.  I am not kidding when I say that you HAVE TO try Liberty Station.  I've only been there once and but was amazing\"... Okay mike... we are going... and without hesitation my husband and I excitedly went to liberty station on our way back from Anthem.  Well let's start at the beginning... Being from Massachusetts... Cape Cod to be exact... I know chowder... and well, this chowder missed on so many marks... Maybe I'm just spoiled (Captain Parkers has my heart)... this was strike one... we didnt/couldnt finish it... you might like it... it seems many here do... BUT NOT THIS EAST COASTER (or here SW husband)...   So, next... I ordered the squash ribs (vegan option.  Yeah... I'm the ass that goes to a BBQ spot and eats vegan/Veg options) They were so bad that I don't even see them on the menu this time... anywho... when I got them and started eating them they were COMPLETELY inedible... when I tried to tell the manager he proceeded to tell me that I didn't how to eat them that people loved them... well... thanks for telling me, I am wrong... oh and brussel sprouts. how to you Fahk up brussel sprouts?  wayyyyyyy over cooked... I digress... the saving grace of the entire afternoon?  Baked beans and cocktails!  Thank goodness for the beans.  they're a magical fruit you know.  so this time... it was my entire family... and after my husband asked me for the third time where I wanted to go and watch the game I said let's try Liberty Station... again? he said... you remember its OVER PRICED and wasn't good... But, I believe in second chances... so, with a look of surprise on his face We headed North...  it felt different... like this time they had it together this time... well... maybe a little... the manager brought us to the patio and we had a hard time seeing the TV screens (the garage doors that close the bar off from the outside don't like to stay up all the way and you can only see half the screen).  However, he said that the west patio had its own TV and we could sit there.  So, we were all by ourselves on the west patio with the Broncos on what seemed to be a great choice of places!  we ordered the Tater Tots -house made. pepper-jack cheese and yukon gold potatoes... these were great.  oh boy... we were excited... we also ordered the brisket fries ANOTHER great choice.  however, just as the door swung close from delivering our Apps, it literally swung open to deliver our main course.  This is frustrating to me.  I wish they were trained better... I wish the server knew his kitchen better.  No biggy we were enjoying what we at already and were a little hungry so, LET'S EAT...  we got the BBQ pork Tacos, Liberty chopped Salad (I think that is what it is called), quesadilla and Baked Beans to share family style... everything was Meh... except the salad the salad was a special kind of MEH... Brown... it had more brown in it then anything... the salad was limp and lifeless AND overstressed.  The 'crispy' apple was limp.  I thought it was a pappardelle noodle and had to look at the menu again.  I being the only vegetarian at the table was SOOOO hungry by now and was waiting for the servers 2min/2bite check back... which NEVER. EVER. CAME.  After we were finished he FINALLY came back to the table I explained that the salad was in need of assistance to the trash.  He apologized offered me something else and I accepted... After about 20 min the manager came out and I assumed that he was going to apologize for the salad... when I started to ask HIM about the salad he had NO IDEA what I was talking about... he cut me off shortly after my conversation started \"Well, this is something that your Sous didn't catch.  Expo didn't catch and the server that brought it out didn't catch...\"  \"Let me go take care of this I apologize\" ... Great I thought... My husband being a food establishment owner said \"monday night manager\"... the Bucatini dish I got was good.  Just good... deserts were good... so... Just good.... I'm disappointed to say that we won't be back again... sorry Sean... they couldn't get it together...  I honestly can say that the money that they are charging for this food is WAY TOO MUCH... we truly feel ripped off... 111$ later (88$ after salad and 'good neighbor discount') BBQ is just Okay... South phoenix has better food at lower prices..."}
{"text":"After a great response from management to my first experience my wife and I decided to try Liberty Station again.  This time things were much better.  We were seated immediately, we added two friends to our reservation in the last few hours and that was no problem.  The food we had was excellent.  The highlights were Brisket, Carolina Pork Shoulder from the smokehouse menu.  I love BBQ and this was terrific and plentiful.  The Meatloaf was super and the biggest surprise and delight were the Baked Beans, I've never had better.  Glad they are here and we will be back I'm sure multiple times.  Oh, and we sat inside and I thought the noise was going to be a real bother, it was busy and noisy and two of us have bad hearing, but for some reason we were able to converse just fine.  I don't know acoustics well enough to know if this was by design or by happenstance but either way it was nice to be able to have the energy around us but still be able to talk."}
{"text":"This place is awesome great food Casey and Cameron are the bomb!  The food is really good they have some out of the ordinary options they have seafood they have Smoked Meats they have fabulous cocktails... something for everyone."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly wait staff. Very nice outside area. BBQ as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Nice happy hour, friendly service, and good food. I recommend.  Happy hour ribs are meaty, brisket quesadilla feeds two."}
{"text":"This place was incredible! Our server Ray was super attentive and genuinely kind and interested in our experience. The rest of the entire staff was also really welcoming- paying attention to our 15 month old son and 10 year old too. The food was amazing!! The brisket was so flavorful and tender - just perfect . The kids burger was giant and not a skinny little patty, so yummy ! Whoever designed the place nailed it. It was a great atmosphere for lunch and I could see how welcoming it would be in the evening to grab a cocktail at the open air bar. Just had to give this business a shout out because it deserves it!"}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere new to go outside of our norm, so looked to Yelp for some help! Four stars and not far from home we gave it a try.  We came about 2 pm on a Monday afternoon, so we weren't concerned with a seating issue. Service was great and very attentive. We really look forward to it cooling off so we can enjoy the amazing patio!  I had the burger and my husband had the pulled pork sandwich. Both very good, but the tots stole the show! My husband LOOOOOVES tots and said these are the best he's ever had.  We definitely look forward to putting this on our favorite rotation!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service.  So happy we finally have a high quality restaurant in the area.  You have to try the smoked pork and brisket."}
{"text":"I learned about Liberty Station on Food Network's new show - Eat, Sleep, BBQ.  They showcased the Smoked Pork Bucatini and the Tavern Burger.  Both looked so good that I told hubbyand about it.  He loves BBQ, but he's not as picky as I am.  I want FLAVOR.  I don't want just fatty, flavorless meat.  But that bucatini and the burger both liked amazing, so we decided to check it out.    I made a reservation and requested an outside table.  We arrived about 10 minutes before our reservation, but were seated immediately.  At first I was a little concerned that it might be chilly outdoors as the sun set, but the area we were seated was nicely enclosed so it kept any breeze at bay.    Our waiter, who was excellent, had us salivating over the prime rib special, but I had my mind set on the burger.  And as soon as I ordered it, hubby decided he had to try the bucatini.  We also ordered a side of cornbread.    Now I'll start with the cornbread.  It was good, but didn't have as much flavor as I would have liked.  Didn't stop us from eating all if it though.    The Tavern Burger was ahhh-amazing!  The burger was cooked perfectly. The pulled pork was so flavorful, and any time some slipped off the burger onto my plate, I immediately grabbed my fork and scooped it up.  I was not letting any of it get away.  And if that wasn't enough, the lemonade pickles just topped it off perfectly.  The flavor was inexplicable, but went to well with the pork and beef.  Kudos to the creator of those!  And the bucatini....O M G!  The smell alone was divine, but the taste....perfection!  The broth was so good tha t I started dunking my fries in it.  My half-Italian, bbq loving hubby hada never had anything like it, but andI before we were even halfway through dinner, he was already declaring that we would be back.  So if you want real BBQ, with tons of flavor - Liberty Station is the place you need to go!"}
{"text":"Finally, a restaurant that is friendly and quiet!!! I didn't get a headache trying to talk with my husband during my meal!!! The staff was very nice and we weren't rushed through our meal. Our drinks and wine were brought out well before we were asked to order. Love that! Our waiter was super nice and management asked twice how our meal was. Plenty of outdoor seating as well as indoor and a large bar overlooking the outside patio. Only thing we noticed was that the OpenTable app showed a slightly different menu than the one we were given. We didn't see the Iowa chops, half chicken or daily catch. Being a non-red meat eater, it would have been nice to see a few more chicken entrees. My husband loved the fish and chips! It was a drive up north for us, but I'm sure we will return."}
{"text":"After 10 years, we have finally found KC quality BBQ in Phoenix.  This little intimate smokehouse/tavern was fantastic.  The pork shoulder was a generous portion, good to the last morsel.  The baked beans were loaded with more pork and smoky goodness.  The craft cocktails were both outstanding.  The desert rose' was was tart and refreshing.  The spaghetti western was like a margarita and mojito combined into one.  Topped it off with a moist rum cake for an outstanding meal."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. I had the daquri to start and my husband a glass of wine. Both good. Waitstaff was great. Lunch was the lobster roll with fries and brisket with baked beans and the coleslaw. All was very good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been eaten at the Liberty Station Tavern on numerous occasions, but almost always for happy hour, which is a great deal.  Today we actually made reservations and tried their Sunday Funday brunch.  The bottomless mimosas and bloody marys for $12 were a great deal. For our main courses we opted to split the GREEN CHILI PORK BRUNCH BURRITO (Scrambled Eggs, Bacon, Green Chili Pork, Cheese) and the BRISKET HASH & SCRAMBLED EGGS (Shredded Yukons, Onion, Peppers), both were delicious. This was a great location to watch the Sunday football games, sufficient views of the various TVs from throughout the restaurant without feeling too much like a sports bar. We'll definitely we going back again to enjoy brunch, perhaps on the patio when the weather warms up!"}
{"text":"If you're from New England you will appreciate this authentic lobstah roll...grilled hot dog bun loaded with claw meat!!! location is a bit hidden in the corner of a shopping plaza. Great service..."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now. This time was happy hour so we did appetizers for dinner. The brisket quesadillas were excellent. The street fish tacos disappeared way too easily and the mac and cheese was very good. Probably a 4.5 for the very happy faces and great service. Oh, DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT trying PATI's Rum Cake. I love it!!  I will be back and see it they can hit a 5 ( I always hit a place a few time before I go all in)"}
{"text":"$11 for three tiny little pulled pork tacos, way too expensive. I mean super tiny tortillas with a small spoonful of meat. Should be about $7 or there should be 5 of them at that size. The burger was definitely rare, and was ordered medium. Didn't bother sending it back after waiting a really long time for it. Tasted just ok otherwise, nothing special. Same with the fries, nothing special. The cocktail was extremely weak, could hardly taste the bourbon. The waiter was extremely pleasant and friendly and did a fine job. Therefore, two stars. Very disappointed with dinner, but will come back to try the other BBQ they offer. I will definitely have a proper cocktail at home first."}
{"text":"My wife and had and early dinner on a Saturday and was surprised to find they had Happy Hour on a Saturday. A burger, fries and a craft beer for $14 not bad. Burger was delicious topped with their pulled pork, a nice addition. Ask for a side of BBQ sauce to really seal the deal. Nick our server was very attentive without hovering. We weren't rushed at all as we sat and talked to a nearby table before we left. I would recommend to friends. Hope to get back to the patio before it gets too hot outside."}
{"text":"This has turned out to be a very solid restaurant option in N. Scottsdale...only downside is the heavy rush of patrons between 6-8pm on Friday's...difficult to get a seat...friendly waitstaff and bartenders...decent beer selection...although out of IPA on my last visit...food is really good, and a great/cozy atmosphere...the fireplace outside is awesome and great patio in front as well...this has become a \"regular\" dining spot for us for sure."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday afternoon, and not many people there. Seated right away, but service was slow. Food was good, but a bit pricey. We all enjoyed our meals, but not sure if I would go back. The bar looked like could be fun on weekends, or happy hour."}
{"text":"Third time visit. No reason to increase the stars. Rib Eye Steak tough but edible. Meat Loaf was high quality but not warm enough. Ditto for vegetables. This place has to do a better of job of serving food at the right temperature. This is a consistent problem. The shrimp bow tie pasta was ok, but swimming in loose sauce and onions.  The servers here are pleasant, caring, and efficient.  They were out of Salmon, and Smoked Half Chicken. A request for bread was met with \" I'll see if we have any \". They did... and we were told that would be an additional $1.00. Really? Four people ordering 4 entrees, and you're going to charge them another $1.00 for bread? What's next? A charge for silverware?  Does this strike anyone else as being \"bush league\"?  How can management's thought process be so myopic? Do the owners  think doing this will ingratiate them,  or polarize the relationship, with customers. Inquiring minds want to know. You be the judge!  Here's another rookie mistake. We had a coupon that the server asked to see before we ordered. She accepted it and logged it into their computer. When she presented it to management at the end of our meal, it was rejected because it expired 4/1/12.   Firstly, tell us that upfront. Secondly, would it have been terrible to tell the cutomer that the coupon expired but would be accepted as an accomodation this time, but in the future they would adhere to expiration dates? After all, for a few bucks, management could have created much goodwill....especially in light of everything else that happened.  When we mentioned the coupon incident to the person at the front desk, she said the server didn't handle this properly, and the server should have instead, gone to the manager. Yet it was this same person to whom we were talking, who rejected the coupon when the server presented it to her.  Yes folks...to err is human. To blame it on someone else is..... more human!  And last, but not least. Three visits and three times there was chaos with the check. If you tell them to split the check down the middle, for some reason they don't know what this means. You wind up getting 2 separate checks with the wrong amounts on each. It's very simple. If the bill is $70.00, you put $35.00 on each credit card. They just don't understand.  This restaurant needs someone with good business sense to step up...before it's too late....and they wind up with the same fate that has befallen other restaurants both at this exact location and in this strip center.   Just in case they can't figure it out.... that \"fate\" would be.......  Failure!"}
{"text":"I came by last Wednesday for dinner with a couple friends and luckily for us it was jazz night, so in addition to eating dinner we got to enjoy some live jazz music. We ordered potato skins, a reuben burger, a turkey burger, and the bacon wrapped chicken. Okay, first the potato skins, I was actually surprised when we received the order because when I order potato skins I'm used to getting those thin slices of potato that pretty much are just the potato SKINS! These still had potato in them, which was a welcomed change of pace, plus there was a decent amount of cheese and bacon, I couldn't have made it better myself. I got the reuben burger and it was by far one of THEE best burgers I've ever had. If you like reuben sandwiches these are ten times better, it has the thick beef patty with corned beef on top with sauerkraut on top of that and the flavors are to die for. This burger is by far one of my favorite things at this restaurant. I've eaten there now about half a dozen times. The turkey burger my friend ate and he said it reminds him of thanksgiving. It's a turkey patty with muenster cheese and they make some kind of cranberry mustard on the side that my friend said pulled all the flavors together. My other friend had no complaints about the bacon wrapped chicken, except I've had it since then and I think it's fine as is but just as a personal preference maybe some BBQ sauce on the side to add a little bit of an extra zip to the flavor. Otherwise if you have a Thai food abused palate like mine it might taste a little insipid.   Great food, good price, excellent service. I'll definitely be coming back. :)"}
{"text":"Great spot for fast delicious food with excellent service. Have been three times and it has been consistently good. Some dishes are better than others but that is a matter of taste. You cannot go wrong with pulled pork or brisket but their meatloaf and fish entrees are well prepared too. The sides are good too whether you go with the carbs or the vegetables. Lastly, we have always had friendly attentive service. Jamal was the latest and greatest."}
{"text":"I grew up in Texas.  This Texas brisket beats my Texas memories.  The mac and cheese is good too!  Very good restaurant"}
{"text":"Cannot comment on the food as we did not have a chance to eat.  Made reservations on line, but for the following evening (by mistake).  When the hostess and manager found our reservation, they commented that they had been booked up for two days and that the on line software was unreliable.  They said that they could not accomodate us, as they were fully booked.  Understandable, but their attitude was condescending.  Since they appeared to have a full house, the obviously did not need or want our business.    Went to Indigo Crow, instead.  Made it just in time for the end of Happy Hour.  Another pleasant evening at the Crow.  Should have gone there to begin with.  The predecessor to Liberty Station went out of business for exhibiting this same attitude.  At least we won't have to subject ourselves to it again."}
{"text":"SOLID.   They've only been open for a week, but off to a great start.  The brisket is awesome, as is the service.   We had the Piggy Wings app (pork shoulder spare rib) which was different and very tasty.  Good beers, great indoor / outdoor bar setup.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Hi Sean...your comment to my post said this was addressed with us. It was not, this must have happened to others as well. No one checked in with us or asked if the second burger was better. No need to respond to this post."}
{"text":"Great place, terrific happy hour menu. Nice outdoor space. If you like Bbq, you must try it out!"}
{"text":"We have been there 4 times and I really, really want to like it. Unfortunately the last two times we had real issues with service. Both times it took a very long time to have the wait staff acknowledge us and take an order. The 3rd time it was a very long wait to place the order and then a crazy long wait to get the food, then food then came cold. The 4th time after 15 minutes of no wait staff coming to the table and constantly looking around for someone, we just walked out.  The food is very good here, they specialize in onsite BBQ and it's very tasty. We probably won't be back again after two issues with the service."}
{"text":"Wonderful variety of delicious beautifully presented American favorites.  I had the Carolina pulled pork with beans and slaw. The portion of BBQ was enough for 3 servings.  Wife had the pulled pork tacos, and finished them off. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Well we arrived for happy hour, but things turned out a bit less happy than we had planned. This place takes itself way too seriously even in the middle of the day and there are way too many people working and lurking everywhere. You had the gray haired owner looking all mean and grumpy sitting at a prime spot at the bar and then you had two older hostess type women either sitting at a table or wandering around with nothing really to do at 3pm in the afternoon on a Saturday. Our waiter was very proficient, but he belonged in a fancy steakhouse, not serving me food off the happy hour menu during a football game.    With that said, the food could have overcome all the other weirdness, but no dice on that front either. $5 - potato balls appetizer - overfried and tasted like oil. No cheese goodness like the menu says, just burnt balls of spuds served with plain ole ketchup. Avoid. $9 - Burger - 1/4 burger that is cooked charred on a grill I suppose. tasted more like charcoal than burger. It did have about 1/2 head of lettuce and some very odd tasting special sauce that probably was mustard and ketchup mixed together. Nothing special. $9 - Brisket Quesadilla - very pretty looking, but not that great tasting. It was supposed to contain burnt ends brisket, but I don't think the cooks know the definition of a burnt end. It was just your standard shredded brisket and cheese quesadilla and that really is not gonna knock anybody's socks off. $5 Sangra- watery, lacking alcohol. $8 Peach Cobbler Dessert - Hell no. This waiter must have been fed all the descriptions and makes things sound better than in real life. This cobbler had frozen or canned peaches and that is enough to eliminate it right away. They also claim to put gelato on top, but gelato is soft, not hard like this version, so I gotta assume it was ice cream. This dude already has two other restaurants, but this place was a total failure."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The food was amazing, great week night date spot for sure. My only complaint is that we sat at the bar and the bartender (woman) was arguing with the staff in front of us, which was uncomfortable. We'll be back, though!"}
{"text":"I think they're off to a great start!  I'm not the target audience as a pescatarian but the meat did smell pretty good.  My fish and chips were tasty and my lime gimlet was yummy.  A friend ordered the mai tai and it wasn't great (and seemed out of place on the menu)."}
{"text":"Kevin,  Your key lime pie is head and shoulders better then Joe's Seafood and Prime in Las Vegas. You win my friend. Well done !!"}
{"text":"Super.  Great local cafe.  So glad they opened. Wait staff very attentive. Pork Shredded Taco's are absolutely amazing! It is a lively place which this area needs. Keep up the great food and great service - THANKS!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised last night as we had dinner at Liberty Station,  but it wasn't without a few bumps.  The service was excellent, but I did not consider it a completely good value restaurant. Don't get me wrong i will be going back. First, the positives, I had the pork buccatini, which was excellent.  It had copious amounts of their tender smoked pork, which was wonderful, along with carrots, onions, noodles in a rich broth and it was soooo good. My wife had the fish tacos, listed as an appetizer along with their mac and cheese, which she truly enjoyed both. She also couldn't decide on a wine, so the waiter brought out 2 tastes of wines she was thinking of having, so that really helped her with her decision.  Good move on the waiter's part. What I really was happy about was the temperature of the red wines he brought was perfect! Slightly chilled, as I noticed they store their wines properly in a cooled wine unit, instead of bringing you a warm glass of red, it's stored at cellar temperature,  if I had to guess in mid to high 50s degree range, instead of 80 degrees room temperature as most restaurants mistakenly do. Who wants to drink a warm bottle of red wi ne? I must get back to the value and negative  part. I also ordered the Caesar salad, and I ordered the $7 small size, and it was terribly small for that amount of money.  The Caesar dressing tasted more like an Italian dressing, very little leaves of romaine, in fact it seemed to have as much croutons as lettuce. And finally in looking over the prices of their bbq plates, fried chicken,  and a couple of other menu items, I had a hard time ordering them as they were so expensive. Maybe I'm behind the times in restaurant pricing, but I've heard good things about those menu items, and might try them at a later date, but it looks like a little too much for my pocketbook on a regular basis.  Last but again, I must say I'll try them again"}
{"text":"Great service and great food!  Will definitely come here again.  The bartenders were friendly and wonderful."}
{"text":"So happy we found this place for dinner. We were staying with friends nearby at the Boulders. The service was attentive.  We were impressed that everyone from our server to the owner made sure we were enjoying our meal and experience. The beef brisket was very tender. We enjoyed the firecracker shrimp but I would have preferred it a bit spicier. The sweet potato fries were large with a nice crunch. We would definitely go back especially considering the wonderful service we received."}
{"text":"How burgers should taste!! If I can bite into a juicy burger with all the yummy toppings and still taste the glorious beef, ya know it's a good burger.  Perfectly toasted bun, juicy tasty burger with a yummy sauce, washed down with a bottomless Bloody Mary? Yeah that just happened and it was glorious.  I'd come back here after a day on the trails in heartbeat."}
{"text":"Excited about the thought of a new BBQ establishment so we tried this on Wednesday night  Small inside area , although a large patio area  this area is great in the cooler months but a little hot in the warmer ones  Ordered the brisket with two choices. The sides I decided on were corn bread and coleslaw. I preferred the smaller portion of meat rather than the larger serving size that is offered.   The cornbread was tasteless. When I asked for either honey or butter to accompany the bread the server literally said\"it was made with honey in it\" okay got the message you didn't want to serve any butter with it.   The coleslaw was the creamy version. The cabbage was literally swimming in a creamy dressing.  I thought a spoon was needed rather than a fork to eat it   The brisket was okay, although it didn't have much taste to it either the saving grace for the meat was the sauce. Good sauce with a little kick to it"}
{"text":"Great place! Had several items on their menu all were really good. Love the outdoor seating and the staff are super friendly!"}
{"text":"Best brisket in a great atmosphere. We had diner on  a shady patio. The service was attentive but not too attentive. A real find on the Scottsdale/Carefree line."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on Check Please and had to try it as my husband is a bbq rib conissiour.  I made a reservation using Open Table and we were seated promptly at 5pm.  I ordered the s"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Highly recommend the brisket and the Tavern Burger. Excellent food. Service was outstanding. Our meal was perfectly timed. A casual atmosphere with a degree of sophistication. Good kids menu as well. This restaurant is a great value."}
{"text":"I went to Liberty Station for the first time last night.  I went with several friends that had been there before.  We met there for Happy Hour.  About 4 of us ordered the house Chardonnay, but were told they were out of it.  This was at 4:30 pm.  Andrew, our waiter, was great.  He said we could order the next more expensive chard for the happy hour price, but only once.  So for the remainder of the happy hour we were paying $9.50 per glass instead of $5.00. That's a sizable increase.  Then at 5;45 the restaurant had run out of that 2 nd wine. We all had dinner there, there were 8 of us so that was a sizable business for you. My hamburger and chopped salad were delicious, but for future happy hours, I will be going elsewhere.  Not my problem that your inventory is mismanaged."}
{"text":"Great place. Good TVs for games. Server was excellent. The food was much better than \"bar food\" and we enjoyed everything that we ordered. Would def go back."}
{"text":"We stopped for happy hour and they were out of the  Bogle Sauvignon Blanc . The only other white on the happy hour menu was Chardonnay . The manager would not make any substitutions . The waitress was embarrassed. Unfortunately we are there another time and a friend order a mixed drink with Tito's and they were out of Tito's."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.   Clean and well managed.   Monica was warm and friendly.   Raymond is an excellent server!"}
{"text":"Our party of 6 stopped by tonight for dinner. Apparently the intended clientle is the over 65 crowd and although my 11 year old and 9 month old were treated kindly, I found it a bit off putting to have one of the staff sweep the floor for the 5 baby snacks my baby dropped under his high chair before we've even been served dinner. Seriously...5 crunchies. And I would have picked them up myself before we left but apparently they were bothering someone enough that she had to drag out the broom and dust pan and make a scene about sweeping them up.   From the get-go our server seemed disinterested in us. Audrey N was our server and although she never did introduce herself, her name is printed on my tab so I'm assuming that's her name. Our drinks were not just empty, they were bone dry unless we specifically asked for a refill. There is no bread service...at least not any that we received so it was a long wait between the time we ordered and when we got our meals...especially when our drinks were empty in the process. Evidently there were dinner specials that we only found out about after we placed our order and only because we heard her sharing them with the table next to us. She never offered appetizers which we might have been talked in to but alas, that's an upsell that she won't get. And we really threw her off when my husband asked her to describe the meatloaf dinner. He was intending to find out about whether the meatloaf had gravy on it and how it was served (sliced, a mini loaf, etc) but his question really threw Audrey for a loop as she had no idea how to describe how the meatloaf was served. She never checked on us during the course of our meal though she was quite attentive to the over 65 table of 4 next to us. Finally, we would have liked to try the dessert, but Audrey unceremoniously dropped off our check without so much as a mention of dessert. Again, another upsell that she missed out on. Believe me, I really tried to keep an open mind about this place, but Audrey brought any sense of positive energy to a grinding halt.  The food was....confusing. The reason for my confusion is that the food, although all distributed on the same plate, was all different temperature ranges. I ordered the pot roast with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies. The food was all different temps and even within the individual items, there were varying degrees of temperature as well....none of which would I describe as h-o-t. It was more like luke warm, cold, and stone cold. Further, the portion was adequate if you don't mind 1 cup of mashed potatoes, 1 cup of veggies to about a 2 oz portion of pot roast meat. The price seems satisfactory enough but if I'm only getting 2 oz of meat, it's out of balance. The little bit of pot roast I did have seemed tender and flavorful though and the mashed potatoes were seasoned nicely. The veggies were varying degrees of doneness with the broccoli undercooked and the squash a mushy mess.   My husband did get the meatloaf and it wasn't drowning in gravy which was good, but he also experienced the varying temperature degrees as well. His meatloaf went from slightly warm on the edges to ice cold in the center. His potatoes were stone cold.   My son and another guest had burgers which they enjoyed, but the \"freedom fries\" were basically frozen fries so they were uninteresting and soggy at best. Our final guest ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich which wasn't terribly buffalo'd in flavor and had the same frozen fries to accompany them.   The lone stand out was the absolutely delicious sweet potato/jalapeno soup that I had with my dinner. It was fantastic albeit luke warm.   If I could offer any piece of advice it would be to make sure you treat ALL of your customers professionally and kindly because once those snowbirds go home, you're stuck with the families who actually reside in the area and when you haven't treated us right, we aren't going to pick your place to come back to visit. Work on your serving temperatures and timing so that hot food comes out HOT and train Audrey. Seriously. Oh and the pictures hung in the dining room that are for sale that feature women in bikini tops? Tuh, ack, eey and distasteful at best."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming here and the food has yet to disappoint. I definitely recommend their shrimp for appetizer and their po boy sandwich for entree. The service hasn't been the best is why this isn't a five star but I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who's in the area. Great patio seating for large and small parties."}
{"text":"I'm not a BBQ expert but this is the best I've tried. I lucked out on my first visit... went off hours with my girlfriend on a weekend afternoon. Jamel is funny and does a good job. OK... there are some kinks in coordinating kitchen and bar service. The biggest problem is the limited (especially indoor!) seating... this restaurant really needs a bigger location. No indoor seating for hours in advance a lot of times... so plan to use the Opentable link to schedule. I'd give it 4+ stars on food... I hope they work the location/service issues out! I like the Tavern Burger w/ pulled pork and sides.. just plan for stretch shorts and a couch siesta after!"}
{"text":"Very excited to see this new restaurant in my area.  They are still in a soft-opening phase, but I would say I haven't experienced any of the typical growing pains.  They aim to please, get the food out expediently and it's very good.  I think their biggest problem will be the size of the place because everyone is going to want to go here!  Good luck Liberty Station and welcome to the area!"}
{"text":"RedWine was chilled, why? Who does that?...brisket was fatty...coleslaw was taste less...service was good...would I go back again?"}
{"text":"I read a lot of reviews that say that the food is \"amazing\". Well at liberty station it truly is excellent fare. Great concepts and flavors make this place a must try. Classic American dishes with a great spin makes it a standout in cave Creek. Everything from the Cobb and tomatoe bisque to the smoked wings and meatloaf melt makes me want to over eat every time I come here. You won't be sorry with whatever you select!"}
{"text":"The menu is a bit expensive, although the burgers are reasonably priced. Staff was friendly and the service was ok. We had burgers and the roasted chicken. Substituted mashed potatoes with the chicken. It was excellent."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now, once for lunch and then went back another night for dinner. We went for lunch when they had only been open for a couple days and we really enjoyed our food. We split a caesar salad, I had the fish and chips, which had a great flavor,  but there was a little too much breading on the fish. I usually don't eat fried foods, but my husband wanted to try it. The fish was delicious though. My husband had the lobster roll and he thought it was delicious and there was a ton of lobster in it. We have tried the meatloaf, mussels, salmon, and a few other things and they have all been delicious. Our service has been excellent both times and we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Second time at Liberty Station.  Food was excellent but we had a problem with the wine.  We were 4 and I ordered a bottle or Red wine to go with our barbeque platter.  I tasted the wine and it was literally hot (temperature).  I told the waiter the wine was hot but he continued to pour.  We all tasted and told him the wine was hot and not satisfactory.  He came back and told us that he would get us another bottle and chill it first.  I am not a wine snob but I know that wine needs some care and it the wines are kept in a hot area, they will go bad.  I really don't think I will order wine at Liberty Station"}
{"text":"Food was good, but took approximately an hour and a half to finish our meal because the brisket wasn't ready.  We were warned it might take half an hour when we ordered, which was fine, but after waiting half an hour we were told it was going to be longer.  We contemplated leaving without eating.  Shawn (the Manager I believe) was very helpful and accommodating.  He ended up comping  the brisket (which was very good once we received it) and a glass of wine.  However, the Owner (I believe) seemed more interested in everything else aside from speaking with us to make sure we were being taken care of.  Thanks to Shawn and no thanks to the Owner, we will give it another try, hopefully with a better overall experience.  Updated to 4 stars after second visit on April 17th.  Food was still very good, service and overall experience much better, will definitely return."}
{"text":"Second time back. Hard to find better brisket. Sides were tasty as were the other meals our table ordered. Pleasant atmosphere out in the back patio and good service. The coffee could have been hotter..other than that a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Fantastic food in a much needed locale! Highly recommend the short ribs and risotto, firecracker shrimp, smoked brisket, ricotta appetizer.....ok I'm pretty sure you couldn't go wrong with any menu item! Service was extremely attentive. 10 out of 10 would dine again and again"}
{"text":"Liberty Station is located where Eureka Grill use to be at! Same format, they just changed the decor, I had the chicken fried steak, with mashed potatoes. I wanted their fries(they called freedom fries, not french fries) But they were out? mashed potatoes were very good, and the chicken fried steak was also very good. Wife had the pot roast, and mashed potatoes. 1st their mashed potatoes were cold, not cooked all the way? Put everything else seems to be OK. They just opened, so we are going to give them a chance. They need to improve on a few things. Prices are a little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"One of my favorite meals on my trip to AZ. Close to Cave Creek and Scottsdale! Not the best location but the food makes up for it. Their Boston baked beans are AMAZING (thought not very Boston-y, since I'm from there). The corn bread was lack luster but our waitress was so accommodating! And bottomless mimosas!!!"}
{"text":"3 of us dined here last night. If you have firm plans following dining here - DON'T GO.  This place is brand new and they're working out the bugs. The owner knows his stuff, the Manager, Sean, knows his stuff. The waitstaff is still figuring it out!  Having said that, the food was WELL WORTH THE WAIT! Drinks were slow coming out, so I suspect they need another bartender or two. The server, however, was reasonably attentive and doing the best he could do.  EVERYTHING we ate was beyond delicious! Two of us ordered the brisket and after an hour's wait it still wasn't done. The Manager and owner came over to our table and apologized and asked if we could order something different which we did. He explained the brisket was \"resting\" and in exchange for our willingness to order something different he offered us a FREE sampler of the brisket when it was ready.  The \"sampler\" was more than ample for the 3 of us and could've been a meal itself. It was THE BEST brisket I have ever eaten!! We chose the pulled pork in place of the brisket and it, too, was beyond delicious!! The coleslaw was fresh and delicious, the beans were delicious, and one of us ordered the 1/2 chicken and it was delicious. ALL well worth the wait!!  This place deserves 5 stars; however, I gave it 4 because of the long wait and the staff seemingly not having it totally together. The ambiance was good, the Manager and Owner were attentive to everyone around and played multiple roles in the 1 1/2 hours we were there! In time they will work out the logistics! Be patient! But don't miss the opportunity to savor the best barbecue EVER!"}
{"text":"Great Brisket and wonderful service.....nice menu with a great variety of food....Jamal was our server and he's very professional...."}
{"text":"Update- Brought in my husband for lunch on Sunday and it was as Fantastic as the first visit! He loves his burger and fries- my brisket was melt in your mouth amazing!!! The patio on the side is shady and quaint too! Thanks Liberty for another great meal!    Visited for the first time with my girlfriend Diann who resides out in Cave Creek area. We got together at Liberty for some drinks and dinner! The atmosphere was pleasant with an outdoor patio that was lit with twinkling lights. The interior is hip and stylish. Out hostess greeted each group coming in very warmly!! And Brandon our server at the bar was super pleasant and helpful with drinks & food choices!! Our meals were delicious and tender, BBQ that fell off the bone!! Side were equally good we had Mac & cheese, sweet potato fries and they're homemade BBQ chips! It was a fun evening and I will bring my fiancé out for another delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation here at the last minute for 13 people and they got us one within an hour. Set us up on the side patio with misters (I wish they had a lower setting, they made us wet) and a great server. The service was wonderful, even with the large group, children and musical chairs. The drinks were a little strange and didn't match their names and descriptions, not bad drinks just not what you were expecting to get when you ordered. Food was good, I had catfish, it was well cooked. My husband got the brisket it was good, not great. My son got the tavern BBQ platter and said it was good, best meat was the pulled pork. The only complaint I had was the mac and cheese, it's not really mac and cheese it's more a pasta Alfredo with a pesto after taste, you can't taste cheese. I'm one of those people that likes to know what I'm ordering and if you advertise it as mac n cheese and I order it, it's what I want. So even if it's good pasta I'm gonna be disappointed when it's not really mac n cheese. I will most likely be back, I want to try their meatloaf, it how I usually judge a restaurant, I didn't get it cause I didn't feel like something that heavy that night."}
{"text":"I've lived here for 5 years (cave creek) and ate here for the first time. I thought it was typical bar food so it never made me want to stop.  They offer some of the best food up in that area even offering GF options.  I will be sending my friends that way! The smoked wings are amazing, along with the Walleye and even just a burger! My family loves this place!"}
{"text":"I had an appointment near by and decided to give Liberty Station a try for dinner. I am glad I did as the place is great. The wife had the burnt end plate and I had the burnt end grilled cheese sandwich and it was excellent. The grilled cheese sandwich comes with Tomato soup which is the best tomato soup I have ever had and I don't like tomato soup. (Tried it on the waiters recommendation). The people were friendly and the place had a nice feel. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Brought a group after golf and wasn't sure what to expect. My expectations were totally exceeded for both food and service. The barbecue was excellent and we sat on the patio. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to both try & review this place, as my favorite places in North Scottsdale keep closing. ( I'm talking to you Carefree Station & Greasewood Flats! Am I the \"Cooler\"?. In pulling up, I noticed the outside patio was packed. Inside, more of the same, however I found the open stool at the bar. After all the bartenders refused to greet me or make eye contact, one finally acknowledged my presence. Rather than take my drink order, I went back on \"ignore\" mode for another long wait. While I realize the bartenders are filling drink orders for the tables, but since I am sitting there, can't they work me in rather than all that waiting? I ordered the Green Chili Stew with had a little too much of a salt finish but was filling. Anxious to try it again and hoping the service improves!"}
{"text":"Food is very enjoyable and the staff is extremely friendly. I would recommend this restaurant to those looking for good smoked meats."}
{"text":"Went for wine Wednesday and to have some dinner. Decor is nice in the bar but tacky in the dining area. I asked for a wine list and was given a piece of paper with the server's handwriting on it. I declined the wine after that but the others I went with ordered some. The server came back to say that the wine they had ordered was not available this evening. They ordered a different glass. The server came back again and said that was also not available.    My party settled on a wine that was available and after delivering it the server said she needed to do her paperwork and asked if we were done. I guess so lady! So we went in for wine Wednesday for wine and dinner and left with having cheap wine and no dinner. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Last night Liberty Station hosted our book club meeting and they could not have been more welcoming or made us more comfortable.  We were seated on the charming back patio (which I didn't know existed) and though outside, the misters and fan made it very comfortable.  Our server was wonderful---I'm sorry I don't know his name!---took excellent care of us despite twelve orders and twelve separate tickets.  The manager/owner checked on us continuously, to make sure we were happy, that all was well, the music low enough for easy conversation...  This, despite the restaurant being full up inside!  My first visit to Liberty Station I ordered the fish and chips and commented the fish batter was too salty.  I tried it again tonight, and it was perfect.  Big, meaty hunks of fish, perfectly cooked and encrusted in a crisp, savory batter.  The malt vinegar viniagrette was delicious on the fish and fries.  Everyone else was very happy with their meals as well.  As one fellow clubber said, \"We can come here every meeting and I'll just work my way down the menu!\"  It is a great discovery to learn that Liberty Station is able to accommadate a largish group so well and in such a perfect setting.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this new-ish spot in Cave Creek! The burger is outstanding, their brisket is moist and so flavorful, the Moscow Mules are cool, refreshing and not too tart! We love to sit out on the patio or in the bar.  You'll absolutely enjoy this spot if you love BBQ!"}
{"text":"Absolute lack of leadership.   It is a new restaurant with new staff and the guy I think was the manager spent his time on his cell phone in the office and folding towels at the bar. The menu had no descriptions, so it was just a price list. Ten thousand ways to make meatloaf. My waiter had no clue what was in the meatloaf or the short ribs. He asked the kitchen and came back saying it contained all the meat on the smoker list plus carrots and it was salty. The kid was overwhelmed and no one was there to help him. The $26 short ribs turned out to be a playing- card-sized piece of meat with half cup of risotto and 4 mushrooms. The taste was so unremarkable that I have no words to describe it. Our waiter really needed a manager to look out for him and support him. It took a while for the waiter to come back so we could order dessert, which we should have skipped. THE COFFEE WAS COLD! The dessert menu was for a 70 year old English man. We ordered apple crumb with cream and it turned out to be cheesecake with apples. Again, no descrptions. Also, no crumb and no cream. At 6:10 we had to track down a bus girl about the cold coffee. At 6:31 I got hot coffee, and at 7:20, I still have coffee grounds between my teeth. See pic."}
{"text":"Amazing bbq and our waiter was superb.  I highly recommend the brisket it was the best."}
{"text":"Needed to do Happy Hour. Cruising down Bell Ave and saw Liberty Station. Came in at 4:50 & got seated right away. I sat on the 'restaurant' side, not knowing there was a bar side. Got a G'Knight IPA by Oskar Blues brewery. Ordered the Alaskan Cod Cakes from the appetizers menu. 2 cakes. Very good. Waitress was friendly. It took a long time to get my cod cakes. The waitress said Chef is making them by hand and asked did I mind waiting. Overall it was worth the wait. Liberty Station is a good place & worth a try"}
{"text":"This place rocks.  The food is outstanding. Try the brisket, the tacos, the fish and chips, and burgers. And the peach cobbler is great. The service is great and the staff is friendly and engaging. It is our new go-to spot. Oh, yeah, and Happy Hour is awesome."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. We came here on a Wednesday night with my son and one of his friends. We asked to be seated outside. Good spot!  I felt like the service was a bit slow...nobody seem to be moving very fast... food was OK.  I got the meatloaf sandwich..dry and just Ok, the Coleslaw was very bland and I would not recommend it. My son ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup and his friend got meat loaf main meal and my overall review of the food was everything was OK.  Lots of parking nearby.  The hostess was very friendly."}
{"text":"Firecracker shrimp and brisket grilled cheese is all you need. A big fan of uncle Louis pizza when it used to occupy this building but definitely a reasonable replacement"}
{"text":"In snowbird season, place difficult to get in and get a decent table without a reservation..lady at door that is seating/taking reservations was a bit to 'haughty' in her attitude as far as I'm concerned. Burger was good, however most foods offered there are. about the hickory-type flavor..not enough diversity on the menu if you're not particularly into that flavor of seasoning/cooking. Please expand menu a bit..maybe some sandwiches without a smoked flavor would be good."}
{"text":"This place needs work in the kitchen! Flatiron steak tough, hamburger very thin and bun was too thick. Brocolini tough chewy. Please get new chef!!"}
{"text":"Wow ! What a hidden gem- loved our meal, the setting and value.  Sister restaurant  of Market Street Kitchen (so I hear anyway) but totally different menu.  Try it for sure- great meal"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, busy (that's a great sign), pretty darned good Smoked fare brisket and pork butt and chicken...all good! Service is solid and timely and attentive. Management is on the floor and always making sure everything runs smoothly and people are happy. Will definitely return. This was our first experience."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very nice and inviting and the food was delicious. For lunch, the three of us shared the fish tacos, shrimp and ribs with corn bread and sweet potato fries. All of the food was delicious with the fish tacos and sweet potato fries being the best!  Great service and very clean restrooms. We will be back soon to try other items on the menu. If you enjoy great BBQ,  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Called the number on the website and made reservations for 6:45 tonight.  Unfortunately, it was apparently my fault that the number on the website was for their sister restaurant, Market Street Kitchen.   Rather than try to do something for us, I was told to call the number back and see where the reservation was for.  I told them it was the number on the website, the woman said it's not our number.  Then said it would be 30 minutes with at least 7 tables open.  Nothing even as much as seeing if there was anything at the bar for us, but rather told me to check.   We are regulars at MSK, I sure hope they get things in order here."}
{"text":"Just have the firecracker shrimp on happy hour boy is that tasty I know they have it at their market Street kitchen as well and just as tasty. Great happy hour or dinner spot."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Los Angeles and was brought here for dinner. I liked it so much, I brought my husband back when he came to town a few days later.  Wonderful, attentive, friendly staff, excellent drinks (they make a great Sazerac) and a green chile pork stew that I can't stop thinking about (only NINE BUCKS on the Happy Hour menu). The menu is elevated comfort food with a Tex Mex flair, but much more thoughtful than a lot of other places.    I love the heat, so I don't mind the outdoor seating in the evenings during the summer. The misters help. It might look like a chain from the outside, but it doesn't behave like one. This is not the kind of restaurant I would normally go nuts for, but this place is indeed special. Now go get that pork stew!"}
{"text":"Delicious smoked food and a nice atmosphere.  The happy hour menu is excellent! Will make LS one of my regular places to visit."}
{"text":"So amazing saw on Sonora Living so gave it a try Drink was amazing an the food was to die for, staff was friendly, fast service, all round  Amazing place!!! The bar tender Casey, talented bar tender knows how to work behind a bar take charge  Knows his stuff"}
{"text":"We went here for happy hour and it blew us away!! We had the ribs, tacos, and chicken wings. Each item was flavorful!! The service was excellent !! We are going back tonight for happy hour"}
{"text":"A breezy cool Sunday afternoon spent mountain biking with my girl...   Then she found this place and we had drinks on the patio with a killer burger! How does it get any better? I don't know or at least I can't say here on yelp!   Liberty Station is good eats, good drinks, excellent service and a nice patio with a fireplace. Have the burger for sure along the french fry appetizer."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Tried this place on a whim because bbq sounded good, but Liberty Station exceeded expectations. My wife and I shared the (large) brisket quesadilla appetizer, then she had the pork shoulder and l the brisket. Both were excellent - some of the best bbq we've had in the valley, in the same class as Little Miss. The sides were fantastic, as well - the baked beans in particular stood out - they were definitely homemade (with shredded pork!), not Busch's from a can like you'd find in some places, and were delicious. Even the house salads - an item that many places phone in - were wonderful. Service was attentive, helpful, friendly, and prompt. I was impressed enough that I knew I had to finally leave my first Yelp review.  We live an hour away, but we'll definitely be back next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"My wife recommended Liberty Station after a night out with friends. Wow... this place is good. The Brisket Quesadilla is a must. You can taste the Skokie flavor of the meat! The patio is great at sunset, and it has heaters that are situated just right. The crowd I'd definitely older in the 6PM timeframe. But it doesn't matter... this place is legit!"}
{"text":"This place has a great menu. We started with the firecracker shrimp which was an excellent appetizer for 4 people. I finally settled on having a half-serving of pork (which was HUGE) with a wedge salad. Sadly, the pork was overcooked and mushy, although the wedge salad (which you can get as one of your two sides) was great. Another in our group was very happy with the walleye.   Possibly because it was a Friday evening during spring break, service was very cordial but perilously slow. I'd be inclined to try them again for take out so that I didn't have to wait so long.  Edit: We did convert the leftover pork into sliders for our drive home the following day!"}
{"text":"Always exciting when I new restaurant open close to home. Arrived early and sat at the bar to try happy hour.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and the staff was very warm and welcoming.  The happy hour menu  was really good.  Lots of choices and good prices with $5 glasses of wine and $4 local drafts and $5 and $9 food items.  Would definitely come back for full dinner.  Highly recommend using Open Table to make a reservation as we saw several parties turn away when they were told how long the wait was for a table."}
{"text":"Had the brisket here, and it was top notch. The owner also has Market Street Kitchen in DC Ranch too, but I might be coming here more often now! Definitely a great spot to take the family."}
{"text":"Their burgers are great, haven't tried much else yet. The beer is reasonably priced, and their happy hour is great. The bar is very comfortable, airy, and everybody is really happy. My only complaint is the service was a bit slow. I sat down at the bar for a beer, waited, watched other people come in and get served, and hugs from the bartender, all before I got a hello. Friends get preference I guess. But I'll be back anyway."}
{"text":"This was our second time coming here and both times have been fantastic! Service was great (we are very picky about our service and they were on it). Drinks were great and the food was fantastic again. Will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago for a business meeting and forgot to write a review! This place is great the servers are nice and it's very clean inside. I ordered the chicken Cesar salad and it was great! The chicken was super tender and not chewy. There was the perfect amount of dressing on it and it was the perfect amount of food. Definitely gonna go back with the family and try other things!"}
{"text":"The brisket was dry and fatty and the pulled pork was also dry. Meh. I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"I stopped by on a Sunday for lunch. Had the BBQ pork sandwich which was done perfectly. Apparently they smoke their own meats. The sandwich was big enough for two people..which included coleslaw and fries. The bar is an inside and outside bar...great place to watch sports on the several of large monitors.. service was outstanding and very responsive. Next time you are near Carefree gives this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Bartenders are great!  Food is fantastic-clam chowder...top three I have ever had.  Lobster rolls-BBQ-they have it all.  Great beer selection also.  You won't go wrong here-thanks to yelp I have a new eating joint in my own back yard I never would have known about!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed an incredible selection of tacos, quesadillas and pulled pork at a recent Carefree Cave Creek Chamber mixer. These reviews are amazing and have us thinking we need to visit for happy hour...see you soon!"}
{"text":"5 star BRISKET!  Did I mention the BRISKET? So if you are in the mood for BRISKET this is the place. The place is unusual. It looks like a bar. The menu includes items you may find in a bar. But they have a smoker. Did I mention the Brisket ? It was by far the highest quality meat prepared to moist and \"cut it with your fork\" perfection. Here is the unusual part, it's summer, 115 degrees outside. Most places in the valley are empty. This spot is packed. People are even sitting outside on the patio. Yes they have misters and fans, but it's still 115. So... you actually need reservations. There is room at the bar. Tables inside full. So to dinner, I actually had a small Cobb, and the wife ordered the heavenly brisket. Not sure if it tasted better because it was on her plate or that it was hand down the best brisket this foodie has ever eaten.  Drive here from Anywhere! 100 miles. Get in your car. 500 miles, take a plane. In Texas, Tennessee, or Missouri sorry this is a serious national threat to your reputations."}
{"text":"Looking for a nice neighborhood restaurant? Then you will like Liberty Station.  It has a nice dining area and great patio.  The menu is simple, but that is a good thing because they do every dish well.  The friendly staff will welcome you with open arms.  Happy hour is the time to go, but if you can't make it that early no problem you will still enjoy yourself.  It is our new \"go too\" place."}
{"text":"My husband and I were delighted we found such an awesome restaurant for dinner. We are from out of town and yelped restaurants. The hostess was very cheery, sat us right away. Wait staff was attentive. The hostess later went table to table to greet everyone and make sure all of their expectations were being met. Food was delicious and plentiful. This will definitely be a place we come back to."}
{"text":"Good BBQ! We like more of the vinegar-based BBQ (versus brown sugar/saucy BBQ) and this place nails it. Short ribs, brisket, and pulled pork are delicious. Creamy coleslaw is good, could be better. We've had the fish entree and Reuben sandwich, loved both of those. We've had the Brussels sprouts a few times...when they are roasted dark, they're awesome. We had them once under cooked and tasted like they were steamed,  it I think that was an anomaly.  The green chili stew was ok, not amazing. The atmosphere is great- well decorated. Several community tables inside and out, and plenty of bar seating. The patio looks great and will be better once they install shades on the pergola. We've been several times and like it!"}
{"text":"Great service from Jamel. Very personable and helpful with the menu. Happy hour is a great value. Ribs and smoked chicken wings were really good.  Nice patio, great service, good vibe."}
{"text":"We had heard this restaurant was opening and decided to give it a try after reading the menu.  I had the beef brisket (8 oz portion instead of 16 oz).  Although a bit fatty, the flavor was very good as well as the accompanying sauce.  I choose the cornbread and mac & cheese as my 2 sides.  The cornbread was very tasty.  The mac & cheese was not the usual but I think it had green chiles in it. It was very flavorful and cheesy. We also had the tavern burger which was 1/2 lb of natural beef with cheddar and BBQ pulled pork.  Very different combination and worth returning for. The lemonade pickles were very tasty since I don't like dill pickles.  The house dusted potato chips were so so and our waitress (who was attentive) offered to replace them with another side. We choose the french fries and they were fresh and tasty.  We are fortunate that this place is fairly close to our house since we will be returning."}
{"text":"A cozy indoor seating area with both tables & booths.  A substantially sized bar and multiple TVs.  Outside sharing-hightop tables, as well as cafe style seating.  Yet another quaint outdoor patio with tables for foursomes; an outdoor fireplace is here.  Now for the menu; well done with not too many options.  The brisket, steelhead, mac-n-cheese and the Brussels sprouts all had tantalizing flavors.  Generously portioned ice teas: green & black.  A bit of time for food to table but all was hot and worth the wait,  Service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Service (bartender and one other server only), no ambiance, food (bland) = thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best brisket I've had in quite a long time.  We also got the crab cakes which were delicious too.  I even suggested we go dancing at Buffalo Chip just so I could go back to eat at Liberty Station."}
{"text":"My wife and I gave the place a chance to get settled, and after reading all the \"amazing\" reviews decided to give it a try. The service was very good. Very attentive during our entire view. I ordered the lobster roll and my wife ordered the burger. Lobster salad filling was pretty good, but the roll was stale. The fries were very good. $19.00 for the lobster roll. My wife's burger was good, but not \"amazing\" and expensive. Not as good as CBCB and only barely as good as a chain restaurant.  We stopped in for lunch and I thought the menu was sparse. I really wanted to try the BBQ, but the only item I saw as a $42.00 for a multi-meat (2-3) platter. I don't remember how many since I was stunned by the price.  Probably wouldn't got back. Too many good restaurants around."}
{"text":"We went with a crowd of eight.  Everyone liked their entrees, service was good.  Very busy both inside and out, make sure you have a reservation"}
{"text":"Chill little spot close to Cave Creek and Carefree offering a good bite of food.  The staff was very friendly and personable which made the atmosphere that much better.    We enjoyed the outside part of the bar and getting to see inside the full restaurant.  It's modernly decorated and gives off a new clean feel.  The meal came with real material white napkins that they place your plate on and the silverware is wrapped in the same type.  It's a very clean and enjoyable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great experience! Loved the menu, great selections of BBQ, burgers, etc! Had the brisket grilled cheese with tomato soup which was amazing! My husband had the brisket and firecracker shrimp! Kid friendly too. Staff was attentive and atmosphere was great. Would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  Cool vibe & great food.  SO happy to have this excellent newcomer in our neighborhood:)  Emphasis is on \"smoked/barbeque\"  entrees, but there is definitely something for everyone on this inventive and comprehensive menu.  Look forward to many future visits!"}
{"text":"Our foursome ate there last week and were pretty impressed with the nice menu. Unfortunately the food didn't live up to our expectations. Crabcakes were OK but nothing to write home about. Brisket was average; based on our servers recommendation the entree failed to live up to the billing.   Speaking of the server I can't recall his name but he didn't excellent job and I must say the service was the highlight of the experience.  Well I give this restaurant another chance? Yes."}
{"text":"Good solid place, nice outdoors area.  A bit over priced.  Smoked foods are good but expensive, $3o for lunch is a bit much."}
{"text":"Great spot!  Great food and friendly staff!!!  Green Chile stew and fish and chips are outstanding!"}
{"text":"TriTip grilled cheese with tomato soup hot the spot. Very nice outdoor seating, good tunes, terrific service & happy hour EVERYDAY!"}
{"text":"Omg, this is the best brisket we've had in awhile. As we were leaving, we were offered a sample of the pork shoulder, and it was even better. 5 stars for food and service!"}
{"text":"This was by far one of our favorite dining experiences ever! From the moment we walked in the door to the time we left, we were welcomed and treated like guests. The food was absolutely exceptional, every little bit. The service was over the top! We will be back again & again!"}
{"text":"We had such a great time at happy hour today. Not only was the food outstanding but the service and the management made the entire time enjoyable. We had no issue also bringing our little baby which sometimes is a hassle but the staff instead made us feel very comfortable and happy. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a weekend day. My husband had wings and hasn't stopped talking about them. He claims they are the best he's ever had. I had Brussels sprouts. They were delicious, some kind of mustard sauce. Delightful. They could definitely stand a few more vegetarian options on the menu and there were a notable amount of flies in the joint. It is expensive. We will go back but because of the price it feels like a special occasion place, not a casual lunch place. The server was awesome, funny and genuine."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday 3/26 evening for dinner.  Everyone was very pleasant except the service was very slow.  We liked our server and he offered many apologies throughout our visit.  I ordered the tavern burger but wasn't able to eat it because it was so over cooked it tasted like an extremely well done frozen burger patty.   The burger came with french fries that were soft/soggy(undercooked).  My wife's $24 short ribs were also overdone and tough.  The bright spot was my son's meatloaf, so if you go that might be a safe choice.  We also tried the apple crumb cheesecake.  The cheesecake itself was good but the mix with apple slices didn't go over well for us.  I understand that the restaurant has only been operating a couple weeks but since the owners are experienced restauranteurs I'm having trouble reconciling their inability to serve properly cooked food, especially at the prices they are charging.  They are quite friendly though and I really hope they get all the kinks out."}
{"text":"Such an amazing little place. The ambience is outstanding. The service was great and the food was out standing! Thank you LST for the amazing evening. Can not wait for next time."}
{"text":"Had the baked steelhead fish which was awesome. However the sides, Yukon potatoes were dried out and room temp, looking like they had spent a long time in a warmer, the baby beets and mushrooms were in the same condition. The portions were sparse also for the pricing. I was hopeful for a new restaurant so close to home."}
{"text":"We took the parents there for dinner last night for my husbands birthday. Wow! The food was superb and the service was fantastic. Bob said the fish and chips were some of the best he has ever had. My steak was melt in your mouth good and tender. They brought a complimentary rum cake to the table with a candle for the birthday boy which was delicious! All of us will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Super tender and tasty beef brisket. My sons had the short rib grilled cheese and fried chicken and gave both dishes a thumbs up."}
{"text":"First time here and I found it to be a well designed space. I sat at the communal table which I'm a fan of. It was Happy Hour so I ordered off this very reasonable priced menu. I start with the firecracker shrimp. The portion is very large, the spice is a little subtle for me but I think most will enjoy them. I then ordered the chopped salad and meatloaf sandwich. Unfortunately they came at the same time which is a pet peeve of mine. The female who sat me immediately came over and said she would replace my sandwich with a new one so I could enjoy my salad. Boom, that is proper customer service. I declined the offer because I knew I was going to only nibble on everything I had ordered. The salad was very satisfying, I love fruits and nuts in a salad. The meatloaf sandwich needs a tomato or chili sauce topping like a traditional loaf, it was bland. I ordered the rum cake for dessert. The presentation is classy and very pretty to look at. I prefer more rum flavor in my rum cake but overall it was pleasant. The dessert was comped, they felt bad about the earlier mix up. Again, great customer service. My waiter was top notch. His skills are typically found in super high end restaurants which was a welcomed surprise. I'll try this establishment again, customer service goes a long way with me."}
{"text":"I live in Mesa but was up in this area for a golf tournament and decided to pop in for some dinner. I came in around 7 and it was fairly busy for a Tuesday night. I just sat up at the bar and ate there.   The bartenders were attentive, I had some questions about the menu and asked for some suggestions and they were happy to help. I ended up ordering the brisket, with corn bread and the house chips.   The food arrived on time. My order wasn't correct, they gave me mac and cheese instead of the cornbread but I wasn't really fussed about it, not a huge issue there because I like mac and cheese just fine.   The brisket was really good. It was tender and paired well with the BBQ sauce they use. The only thing that wasn't really great was the sides. The house chips were pretty hard borderline stale and the mac and cheese wasn't hot so the cheese sort of created a bit of a cement.   Everything about this place is great, except in my opinion, the sides."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant at Terravita Marketplace (Scottsdale Road & Carefree Highway).  The owner has Market Street Kitchen at DC Ranch which is another great spot.  I had the Rueben for lunch which was great.  The services was awesome and they remodeled the place which looks good."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in town  Brisket quesadilla and tavern burger.  Yums  Service is great"}
{"text":"This place it the biggest disappointment. Its too bad.  It has a great setting but the service is ALWAYS slow.  Orders are ALWAYS incorrect and the servers seem to turn over weekly.   I think yesterday will be my last attempt to visit this place.  As the service was below average, the food (chicken wings, under-cooked- raw and pink inside- check your food before eating it!). AND my credit card was charged THREE times, all for different amounts, which I am now working with my credit card company to remove the incorrect charges because of the incompetence of the staff at Liberty Station.   I feel like monthly attempts to give this place a try have been in vain, I would not recommend this place, nor would I go back. I have learned my lesson."}
{"text":"Been there about 6 times. Priced on the high side, especially for the portion size. Value is just OK if we are talking about just food. However the food is very good! Staff is very well trained!!! Service is outstanding each and every time we visited. This is a reflection on over all management. Reminds me of What service use to be like in the restaurant industry. Atmosphere unimpressive. Small and DARK.   On a recent visit for lunch. Ordered clam chowder and Firecracker shrimp. Clam chowder was one of the best I have ever had! Delicious flavor and no bacon. True clam chowder. The shrimp  was awful. The menu describes it as tempura in a thai-sweet chili sauce. Was in no way tempura but a dusting of flour. It also had a burnt taste with a very dark color. This usually indicates a dirty fryer in my experience. My son had chicken tenders with the same issue. Tenders were very dark in color, like burnt looking, but not over cooked.    With so many good meals this was easy to over look. However when my server brought this to the managers attention, that is were my issue began. She agreed to take it off the bill as she should when you send a dish back. However, she was argumentative.Telling me I was wrong, they just cleaned the fryers. Did not want to go there with her. I have owned and consulted many restaurants in the past and know one thing you do not do is argue with a customer even if they are wrong. It's only $12.00, her food cost about $3.00. Apologize and move on. By the way she did apologize for me not liking it. All my good experiences there just went sour due to one manager with attitude or lack of experience. Would have given her the $12 bucks just to stop trying to make me feel like an idiot for not accepting poorly prepared food.  Want to point out that the service was outstanding from the server. She handled everything as she should have. Since there are really no decent restaurants up in Cave Creek, I will probably end up going back. My wife loves the brisket!!! See lots of issues with briskets on yelp. Those folks should look up what a brisket is. Liberty Station dose an outstanding job in their preparation."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  The atmosphere was great, we sat on the enclosed patio and the tables are set up so that you feel you have privacy , the music was fun and not too loud, Desiree the waitress was so good, the hostess was nice and checked on us regularly, the chef delivered the food and was pleasant.  The place was very busy for lunch and the waitress was the only one on, but she was just as pleasant as could be to everyone , she took the orders quickly, filled drinks regularly.  The brisket grilled cheese sandwich was to die for!  I had the tomato soup which is home made and delicious ( plus I stole a lot of my husband's sandwich , it was amazing!)  The staff really impressed us, they treated us like we were  guests in their home."}
{"text":"On top of amazing food, the service and the servers were PHENOMENAL!!! Our server Ray was incredibly fun and knew how to make our night! It happened to my birthday week and they brought out a delicious dessert and they sang to me!!! 10/10 would recommend going to this place if you haven't yet. Also the busser Ryan was a bright smiling face in the restaurant and carried on a conversation even after closing hours."}
{"text":"First off, this is more an upscale sports bar than a barbecue restaurant, and some of the prices reflect that, especially the prices of soft drinks and ice tea. So watch your bill. The ambiance is pleasant and the patio outstanding. The food we had was good--a wedge salad--to outstanding--a brisket quesadilla. I look forward to trying this place for dinner."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner. The food (pork shoulder and hamburger) were delicious. We were served red wine that had been chilled. When we questioned the temperature, the waiter immediately replaced it and the manager came over to apologize. Our waiter, Jamal, was wonderful and kept coming back to make sure everything was fine. Since we often smoke meat at home, we were extremely interested in the great quality of the meat. It was very tender and perfectly seasoned. When we finished our meal, Jamal took us to see their smoker and explain the process. A really delightful experience. We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Phenomenal service - my server Jamel was the BEST. Great atmosphere.  Had the special which was perfectly smoked prime rib, garlic mashed potatoes & asparagus. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One and Done.  First and Last.   Hubs and I visited for the first (and last) time yesterday evening.  Decor cute and friendly staff.  Kind of hard to get to from the parking lot.  Not easily accessible.  So the complaint is the food.  I ordered the brussel sprout apps.  They came dowsed in oil and bacon grease.  Were very heavy and too al Dente for my likes.  Very gooey, yet flavorful.  Just way too much oil.  Also ordered the wedge salad.  Don't waste your $.  Was nothing to speak of and tasteless.  Hubs ordered brisket and tator tots.  Brisket was 1/2 fat!!  Very greasy and not much in the way of meat.  Although he said what meat he got, was tasty.  The tator tots were deep fried but very gooey on the inside and under cooked.  He said he had never had cole slaw that was tasteless and bland before, so that was a first for him!  It is very unusual that we not eat our meals in entirety  but we left quite a bit and were not interested in taking any home.  Our waiter was attentive, friendly and seemed well trained.  Although he did not ask us how we liked our meals or why we left so much.   So what sealed the deal for me was being up most of the night sitting on the toilet!!!!  Been a long time since I was that sick from a meal.  I hadn't eaten since breakfast, so I know it was the brussels sprouts and all of the oil.  It was not a fun night.  Needless to say, there was nothing we experienced that would bring us back.  Probably a great place to just go to the bar and drink.  But for a good meal at the price, I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"One of the most friendly restaurants I have ever visited.  I was asked 3 times within the first 4 minutes of receiving my meal if everything was ok.  The food quality was higher that average for this area and the prices were as well.  Overall no complaints, the food quality was very good and I have to repeat, the friendliness of the staff was off the charts.  It's a real team effort here and you won't walk away unhappy."}
{"text":"Over half of this restaurant is situated with tables outside. We arrived at 5:30 pm and because we made no reservation inside, we were told no seating inside and were forced to sit in the heat outside. Yes there were misters but the temp was 104 degrees and they were of minimal relief.   Initially I asked the hostess and others to seat us inside once a table was available because personally I find it extremely difficult to enjoy a meal when the temperature is 104°.  No one approached us again to enjoy our dinner inside. It's terribly difficult for me to have a hungry appetite when my stomach is nauseous from the heat.   To add salt to the wound the manager came out side at least five times to see how everything was and after we ate I went inside to the restroom and noticed there was indeed room available inside the restaurant.    The food was very good but it's not worth it to me to be miserable while I am having an enjoyable meal and I will never go back again. The servers did make an attempt to offer comfortable service for us in the heat but what a disappointment that the owners are not be more sensitive to the summer heat.  Happy July"}
{"text":"I had a nice meal, food was nothing to write home about. This is really a yuppy bar with a lot young people meeting for happy hour. If you are looking for a serious meal and evening I suggest you go late or when they open. During happy hour the servers are distracted with the happy hour crowd. This is a great place for young people to hang out."}
{"text":"Like the place a lot.  Outdoor bar and seating good, but just in a parking lot.  Wings are exceptional, brisket was delicious and half portion was huge!. Drinks ok. Mac and cheese was fabulous. Fish tacos were delicious but incredible small portion and not proportionate to other dishes.  Waiter was nice, but kitchen seemed a bit of sync. Ex apps before drinks."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed this wonderful find last night with friends! Already looking forward to going back! Great drinks, from what I can remember =  P. Really good food and menu choices! Good service and fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We dropped into LS because First Watch was on a heavy wait.  Thank goodness that they were - as our meals at LS were AMAZING !!  I got the 1/2 pound brisket (chopped) with two sides (reasonably priced for the portions you receive) and all of it was wonderful.  My dining companion got the New England Clam Chowder and the wedge salad.  He raved about both.  I tried his salad and it was TASTY !!  The manager came over to ask how everything was and I told her wonderful with only one small hiccup - I shared with her that the BBQ sauce was served cold and that I felt they should be served warm.  She agreed and advised that they normally are and she headed back to the kitchen to remind them - I was IMPRESSED with her quick action.  We will DEFINITELY return to LS and if I don't have to have another mind numbing order of avocado toast from First Watch that is an added bonus !!"}
{"text":"We had visited Liberty Station twice while staying at the Boulders. Once for dinner and once for lunch. So glad we did! We were able to try some of the BBQ platters that included brisket, mac & cheese, and also the hubs enjoyed ribs. Lunch was the standout though; I enjoyed my brisket quesadilla and also the freshly made from scratch tater tots! SO GOOD! Bring an empty stomach as you'll want to finish every last bite. Friendly service as well. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Liberty Station popped up on my search for lunch on Yelp today, so we decided to try it. Loved the set up of this location; the bar was separating the main dining room and the patio seating. Little hot today, so all the patrons were seated inside. The dining room was really clean and the staff were very friendly and attentive. We ordered the firecracker shrimp for appetizer. It had nice seasoning, but slightly on the salty side. I wished they used larger shrimps too. We also ordered mac and cheese. It was large enough to be served as a meal. It also had nice flavor, but little too saucy for me.  Our main entree was the combo BBQ platter which served 2 people. It had 3 different kinds of meat - brisket, pulled pork and ribs. It also came with 2 sides. The BBQ was really tender and tasted really good. My husband's favorite was the ribs and mine was the pulled pork. I didn't care for the cold slaw, but the sweet potato fries were really good.  We also ordered the lobster roll which our waiter recommended. To be honest, the lobster was little bland. The fries that it came with was really good though, straight out of the fryer.  There were other items on the menu that we wanted to try next time."}
{"text":"I'll do this in categories. This was my first time here, it's been my families 3rd and 4th time.   Atmosphere: really nice, lots of TES for sports viewing. Great bar and patio area.   Service: Really nice server. He was very friendly and informative. Attentive but not hovering.   Food: This is what made me give it 3 stars. 3 out of our 4 meals were not hot. The walleye was cooked well, but very bland. Flavor of the BBQ was good. The BBQ house chips are great.  We ordered coconut gelato, awesome and good portion especially for $6. We had the peach cobbler..... not good. You can see the picture, it came out in cast iron and it tasted like iron and metallic. Not good..... we told the server, he said oh no that's not good and still charged us for it.  I own a restaurant and that was not a good move.   I'd give the place another shot, someday. Won't be top of the list. I do hope they make it, great patio, good sports watching."}
{"text":"BBQ was amazing. Friendly staff with fast service. Glad they are here!"}
{"text":"Nice place.  Good food.  Lobster roll good.  Husband liked the brisket & the tomato bisque"}
{"text":"Ok. The local elderly population loves this place. So you need a reservation. Pretty good food. Not the place for the 20-35 yo' stop hang out. Very much a retirement bar. I am 50 and I was one of the youngest in the place. My server was pretty attentive, but not very knowledgeable about the menu. He might have been new. The fried chicken, as our server told us was very popular. It was dry. Awful. First it's smoked. So it's cooked right? Then it's breaded and deep fried. Really bad. Really dry. And it came with corn bread which was dry as well. If this is their way of getting you to drink more.... it worked. But it was water, we craved. Whoever is running their smoker, left it in way too long.   Tomato soup tasted like canned soup. For the exhorted price, it shouldn't taste like metal.   Food quality is not Cafe Bink. But they want Bink's prices. At least we would see people our age. Maybe we will come back and try it after season is over."}
{"text":"This is the second time my husband and I have tried Liberty Station, both times for lunch. We love this place. The BBQ is very excellent and the sides all with a twist that works very well (truffle mac & cheese with green chilies).   We sit at the bar. Today Cameron was our server and bartender. Very friendly, knowledgeable and got my quite finicky drink order just right!!  Because of several negative reviews on the cornbread, we did not order it last time. This time we shared the BBQ Platter. So yummy!  Comes with two sides. This time my husband, a true Southerner, ordered the corn bread. Don't know what has changed (if anything), but he found the cornbread moist and very flavorful.  We didn't think it needed butter (though i love butter on everything), but we verified you can certainly get a very nice whipped butter if you would like.   We will be back lots."}
{"text":"It was our pleasure to meet Matt Keeler, Director of Operations at Liberty Station.  He and Monica run one of best restaurants in all METRO PHOENIX!   My wife and I were there for their wonderful \"LIBERTY STATION'S HAPPIEST HOUR\"  I would say the best happy hour in all METRO PHOENIX!   This was our dinner as we eat about 4:30 to retire early.  We started with wine.  My wife had a domestic Chardonnay; and I had Their Liberty School Cabernet. Both were very good. To start my wife had small chopped salad which she liked very much.  I am in like their very tasty, CHEESE TAVERN TOTS.  It is a meal all to itself.   My wife had their Liberty Butter Hamburger.  It was very large and she loved every bite.  I had their BBQ Pork Tacos.  It was very, very fresh, tender and most tasty.  I can not wait to return to have it again.   Since it was my birthday, I had mint, chocolate chip ice cream. I can not say enough about our waiter JAMEL!  He is sharp, smart, and quick to our every need, ie:  extra water, more ice, extra napkin , etc.  He was always coming by asking what can he bring us.   This is a Great Restaurant. sincerely, Ed Altman Jr.  Ed Altman, Jr."}
