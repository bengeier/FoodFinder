{"text":"Great cocktails! Fab beer fridge. And awesome VHS projection. Also, they give a shit about making sure people feel comfortable in their own skin...(Signage in the loo.)"}
{"text":"Good watering hole.  Couches are super uncomfortable. I like the movies/anything on film there. Good beer selection. Just wish it was more comfortable."}
{"text":"Friends told us about this new spot. Great atmosphere and music is cool but doesn't overpower conversation. The staff is super friendly, and they put care into their cocktails. 

Will be going back"}
{"text":"We walked across the bridge on a cold, cold, Toronto night, shivering. And then, we walked by this place in Little Vietnam, both turning back independently, at the same time.
Now here was an inviting place, old 50-ies movie playing in the back, on a wall covering screen, pinball machine in the corner.
They have an eclectic choice of music and beer and our bartender, Matt, was a cool and sweet cat.
Oh, oh, and they have Hot Dogs!! The old style, that mum made, plain and simple - but soooo good. 
Great atmosphere, lovely time had, will def brave the cold again!"}
{"text":"YES! FARSIDE!

Of course I want to watch Speed on a projector and drink great beer! How did you know!?

Of course I want to sit on tacky comfortable couches!

Of course I want to have great conversation with the bartenders while they make me a killer old fashioned!

Of course I want to order a fucking Mr. Noodle when I'm drunk!

Of course I want a $2.50 Jameson when I definitely don't need one!

Keep on doing what you're doing Farside. In this galactic infirmary we call planet earth, you're my kind of medicine."}
{"text":"I can has admits, there were some \"what the heck is happening in this hood, some kind of invasion?\" kind of hesitation running between me and a friend when we first saw signs that a place like this wants to set up shop in East Chinatown of all places. I thought I'd give it a few whirls when it opened for reals before I start judging. At least it's not another clandestine \"spa\" in the hood.

Farside (because apparently to many Toronto's hipster westenders, crossing the Don is like entering another country, lolz) quickly became a highly rated new bar amongst the local media reviewers (BlogTO, NOW mag, etc.--and then they go on to fetishize Gerrard East as the city's next hot area, lolz). It's run by Rachel Conduit and Mike Reynolds, a couple who amongst each other over the years have carved out a rep for running some highly favoured bars, like Kensington Market's Handlebar (whatever happened to that cheetah?), and the former Avro once not too far down from here (which everyone, including the media reviewers and their great grandmothers, like to reminisce like it's their long dead favorite uncle, lolz). Them eastenders are back east, and their regulars will probably feel right at home crossing into the proper side of the Don in this new digs they staked out.

THE VIBE: they def went for a living room/basement rec room feel. It kinda does too remind me of my friend's dad's dingy Cambodian restaurant that used to be a few doors down, or the many friends and relatives' rec rooms I wasted my youth on video games and surviving horrible karaoke. Farside is unabashedly hipsta, but also comfortable enough that you need not feel out of place (or in another country, lolz). The kitschy nostalgic 80s/90s theme game is strong--c'mon, they even serve birthday cake on a Spice Girls plate! A few vintagey couches and tables complement the spacious bar space.

They play all sorts of old stuff on that back projector screen. Loud tunes get spinning? usually on the weekends, but I particularly like Monday nights, cuz that's when they run a series of VHS movies (you can find out what they plan on screening in advance, either at the door or on their Instagram:). VCR tech is the shit I grew up on man, digital is too weird. Moreover, Farside dedicate part of their ops to supporting local artists, such as regularly rotating the illustration on their menu cover, hosting events, or that back studio room they carved out with an artist-in-residence program to go along with it

DRINKS: You like a blast of spicy, punk? Me too. Then try the Chili Gonzales (yes, as in that music guy). They also obviously got a well versed picking of craft beer. Heck, Mike will even warn you if your choice is highly boozy. Who does that, eh? Certainly no bartender in downtown clubland!

Whoa I'm getting carried away here, so I'll end it by saying that the Farside vibe is certainly chill and mature (as in folks who appreciates the struggles of life before high speed internets). It's quite strangely low-key too most of the time, even on a Saturday night, and sometimes you might find a crew inside playing Magic: The Gathering. Their presence?, along with AAA Bar next door, adds an bubble of some life in a strip that otherwise is dead quiet (aside from the handful of Chinese and pho restaurants opening into the night). And honestly, their existence in this enclave of far way legendary land of eastside Toronto has been more respectful than that goddamned weed dispensar(ies) around the corner from here, so go ahead and drown yourself on some cocktails and cheesy 80s CGI."}
{"text":"Having seen this bar listed in BlogTO as one of the best bars of 2016, I decided I needed to see for myself.

Located on Gerrard St, this small and low-key bar packs an interesting punch.  It's kitschy and fun and just a great time.  The owner (I think her name is Rachel) has another bar in Kensington and I can definitely see that vibe in here.

There are a few tables and a long bar to sit at.  Definitely get the Chili Gonzalez if you are here and like a bit of spice in your drinks.  This hands down was the favorite.  

Rachel (I'm really hoping this is her name....lol) can even customize your drink for you if you don't like a particular ingredient.  She was lovely to talk to and I look forward to coming back here for another spicy night :)"}
{"text":"Great bar. Great beer selections.  Fair prices.  Lots of take out in the neighbourhood if you don't fancy their pickled egg n  birthday cake menu.  Welcoming owners and staff.  Awesome vibe.  Mixed clientele and music.  Love the movies on the walls.  We go early before it gets busy and always have fun.  Couldn't be happier to have them in the neighborhood.  And they gave us birthday cake on our birthday.  C'mon. Doesn't get better."}
