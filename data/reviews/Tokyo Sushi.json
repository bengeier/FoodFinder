{"text":"The sushi is nice and fresh. The presentation is beautiful and the staff is very hospitable. I usually get take out because i live nearby and they always give me some tea and a salad while I'm waiting. Good prices too!"}
{"text":"I've decided not to give away five stars so easily but this place could have got the extra point yesterday. The service was fantastic. I was craving sushi at 22:10 on a Monday and with about 20 minutes until close they decided to serve us. And serve us some awesome spicy salmon and spicy tuna they did. The vibe is very authentic and there is a lot put into the details of presentation."}
{"text":"Thanks for All everyone sofar I closed restaurant by some reason and Sorry about that didn't say goodbye. I will reopen this area soon! I 'll miss you everyone! Don't forget me! I 'll be back!!!!"}
{"text":"The quality of certain ingredients were VERY good for the pricing, but the overall taste of the sushi wasn't as tasty as I would have expected. The portions were adequate, especially when the meals come with miso soup and an appetizer.   The seats were wooden and comfortable but the service and thematic design of the restaurant makes up for this."}
{"text":"Went to Tokyo Sushi for the first time with my family last night, and it was incredible!  The food was fresh, arrived quickly, and served with a smile.    The four of us were able to eat enough sushi we couldn't eat any more, along with sake and beers, and the total bill was only $70.  An absolute steal! Especially because the delicious dinner was sealed with a complimentary dessert: fresh fruit and chocolate!  The owners are incredibly kind and thoughtful, and make a simple night out for sushi something special.  We are so lucky to have this gem in the neighbourhood and my family and I will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Comfortable, quiet place. It's tucked away on a side street but not too hard to find. Definitely a hidden gem in Toronto. It's a little but expensive but the quality of the food is higher than average."}
{"text":"Ordered take out last week and it was AMAZING! Rolls made fresh in front of you. I had the avocado roll and the spicy crab roll, both delicious. Staff were very friendly. Would definitely go. Glad I found this gem."}
{"text":"Excellent spot! After living in the area for almost two years, this is the best spot -in my humble opinion, to get a chirashi!  Came on a Saturday noon and the place wasn't packed, so service and food was definitely 5/5 stars!"}
{"text":"Food: A Service: A Food presentation: A+ Atmosphere: A Prices: B+ Recommended?: Yes  I ordered the sushi and avocado maki with brown rice and grilled scallops. (see pics attached) Everything was super fresh, mouth watering and arrived quickly.  P.S. don't you just hate looooong reviews?"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurants I've ever been to. The service is always warm and welcoming and the food is fresh and expertly prepared. The rolls have a perfect rice-fish ratio and are always delicious, my favourite is the salmon lover's roll! Also very vegetarian/vegan friendly! Everything is very reasonably priced especially for a sushi restaurant. I've lived in the area for a while now and have seen many restaurants close due to ongoing construction nearby. I really hope this one doesn't! Highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Been longing to have decent Japanese food, and tried TOKYO SUSHI for lunch. Love how fresh their food was and very good customer service. Very accommodating how you like your roll to be made.   Excellent place, every table has privacy"}
{"text":"My friend and I had the all you can eat dinner and it was horrible! The service was bad but the food was especially bad.   We first got the same three appetizers; miso soup, sea weed salad and green salad. All awful! The miso soup would have been fine but the spoons were extremely dirty, with old dried up food stuck onto the spoon. The server did not apologize and just said it was because of the miso soup. The sea weed came with a bit of protein; fruit flies were flying around them. Furthermore, the green salad had nothing to it.  The sushi itself was okay. However, the shrimp tempura and dumplings were cold. The ramen was worse than Mr. Noodles and the mussels were nasty. Lastly, the service was a bit slow with refilling water and getting the bill.   The best part was the green tea and mango ice cream."}
{"text":"Ce qui eat franchement marrant de ce restaurant, est que les deux sushis bars restaurants placés l'une à côté de l'autre parviennent du même propriétaire. Celles-ci ont des noms différents, mais leur service reste le même. J'ai fréquenté ce restaurant deux fois à date et tout en étant bilingue, je constate que les serveurs sont tout de même portés à parler en anglais plutôt qu'en français. Cela pose problème pour les francophones puis que même en leur parlant en français, ils ont tendance à répondre en anglais. Par contre, le service demeure excellent et les serveurs prennent la peine même d'exécuter toute réquisition des clients pendant les heures où les deux restaurants sont même surchargés. C'est un restaurant de sushi \"all you can eat\" et la nourriture est délicieuse. Le seul petit hic, c'est qu'il m'est déjà arrivés au moins 2 fois pas plus qu'ils se soient trompés sur notre commande mais bien sûr, cela n'est arrivé que pendant des heures où le restaurant fut surchargé. Je recommande fort bien cet endroit pour ceux qui souhaitent fréquenter un restaurant de sushi où il n'y a pas de prix fixe afin que chaque plat soit consommé tel que souhaité!"}
{"text":"Order  $31.40 + tip extra  1. Salmon maki ( bad ) 2.  Tuna maki ( very bad ) 3.  Ikura ( salmon caviar on rice maki ) - ( bad )  Place was clean ( good ) Tea hot and no smell of chlorine of water ( good )  Salmon maki has wasabi insight ?! ( wasabi in sushi ) but now I know why - to cover test and smell of salmon Tune frozen multiple times - no taste at all marinated Caviar on Ikura - pale and no taste  Result 40 min - and ...  diarrhea !!  Chef : loudly singing ( or trying to singing ) loudly talking on the phone in eating area  sneezing ( no covering mouth by hand ) Seems to me nice and pleasant smiley person - but behave disgustingly    Can have good maki - the same order for $23 ( D&Y sushi Keel&Dundas - taste always GOOD )  I tried ... - and regret ."}
{"text":"One of the better sushi places downtown.  Unlike other sushi places in the area, the salmon sashimi is always fresh. :) My favourites are salmon don (i.e., salmon sashimi on a bed of rice) - best deal if you love salmon; and roll set A.  The more expensive dons are very fresh and tasty too, I just don't order those all the time :P   Friendly staff, great service. When it's packed in other sushi places and loud, I can always bet on coming here to a nice comfortable environment."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Our table was completely neglected. We didn't even get soya sauce and half of our food didn't come. Never again."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Loveboat was amazing!! And ginger! The fish was fresh and everything was very clean!"}
{"text":"This place serves some quality sushi and I think is going to be my go-to take out joint.  I've tried a couple of places in the area and this has been the best thus far.  They ended up giving us extra sides with our order.  We ordered tempura, rolls, and sashimi. All of which were good portions and light on the rice.   Most importantly, the fish tasted fresh.  Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I thought this restaurant would have been amazing since it was extremely busy at lunch time. Tokyo sushi is separated into two sections; one obviously getting better service. Unfortunately for me, the other two people and I were seated in the section farther away from the kitchen.   When I say the service was bad, it was bad in a way you wanted to punch every employee. Like other AYCE sushi buffets, the orders were written on a small piece of paper. However, we did not receive the first order before reminding our servers that it has been 40 minutes and we did not receive our food. After reminding them, our dishes were served promptly and all at the same time. This makes me think that they forgot about us.   Secondly, an unfamiliar looking dish came to our table. It was decided that we did not order this, so we sent it back. After pondering for a few minutes, we figured out it must have been the house roll (my bad!!) so we asked for it again. It irked me a little bit that they brought me back the same dish that they served me with because this makes me feel like they might have kept it for other customers who order the same thing, which is unfair to people if they anticipate fresh sushi.   Despite the somewhat nice ambience and good food, the service was just too bad for me to come back :("}
{"text":"Absolutely an amazing place to eat in downtown Toronto. Highly recommend sashimi don. The quality of food is one of the best in Toronto. :D"}
{"text":"Service was TERRIBLE. Server would rather wipe down tables than seat customers. Food took forever, the sushi chef's gossiped and took their sweet time making orders. Food came out cold, sashimi was not fresh & to top it off, they wanted to charge 8 bucks or so for my 3 year old who didn't even eat, like really?? thumbs down i would never come back."}
{"text":"Want to stuff your face full of a good range of different Japanese dishes? Then this is the place for you! I've been a few times for lunch and have always been satisfied. It's only about $15. This place is much better than Kanda as they have a wide variety of dishes to choose from.   While most reviews say the service is poor, I have always found the service to be excellent. The staff are generally friendly and very efficient. No sooner have you taken off the paper from your chopsticks then a waiter comes to remove it from your table. Water glasses were never empty and dishes were promptly cleared from the table. I've only ever had one dish forgotten, which was a random ice cream order along with sushi. Speaking of the ice cream, I love the green tea ice cream!"}
{"text":"Worst all you can eat sushi bar in Montreal ...  The foot was good but the service not. We spent 3 hours in the restaurant and we didn't eat all we could but more how they could manage to deliver ... and lets say that was far from enough.   They had like 50 tables and only 3 waiters ... 30$ for that!   I hope in the future they will manage to improve the service."}
{"text":"A hidden gem along St. Joseph Street. My favorite sushi place in the neighborhood. Good quality sushi. I love their sashimi, Uni Don is amazing. The owners and staff are very friendly, and their service is excellent. I've been coming to this place since 2003. I must admit, their prices has gone up and the portions are a bit smaller now. However, the level of quality stays the same."}
{"text":"Fast & friendly service; good food :) We ordered takeout as they don't do delivery. Thankfully we only live a short transit ride away. Their sushi is rolled properly... it doesn't fall apart & everything was fresh. I love that they use the natural (I.e. not pink) pickled ginger. Prices are reasonable. We had chicken udon, assorted sashimi, vegetarian combo, & the (delicious, deep fried) Cowboy roll. This is one of the better takeout sushi joints in our neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Waiter spilled something off of someone else's plate onto my clothes and blamed the wetness on the snow outside when I clearly watched the oil drip from his hands...  After sitting down, I noticed that the plate at the table was not clean.   Upon ordering, the Philadelphia rolls had so little cream cheese in it that it was basically non-existent. Most of it was rice. The salad was mushy as well.  This place being cash only, I also had to spend extra $2.50 from the ATM. Not a good experience for me. 1/5"}
{"text":"Sammy!! Tokyo was and is or favourite sushi in the are!  Let us know when you reopen...we will be your first customers!"}
{"text":"Alice's the Tokyo chirashi sushi don! if you're ordering anything else you've been missing out. Hostess was friendly and the restaurant clean. Very awesome neighborhood joint. will be back"}
{"text":"Sushi wasn't that great. Lacked freshness. Price was good, allot of food for the $$. But disturbingly sushi chief was seen leaving bathroom after a 10 min visit and proceeded to make sliced oranges without washing his hands..... !!!!!!!! We knew that no washing of hands had taken place when we inspected the washbasin  it was bone dry...   SICK !!!!   Wont be going back."}
{"text":"Service is excellent! Food is served by the owners and are super courteous! It is a great deal comparing the amount you pay with the size of the dish (Salmon Teriyaki). I'd definitely come back. Loved it!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty homey. I go to school at UofT so I come here pretty often with my friends. There's only one thing I order off the menu tho, and that's Bim Bim Bap. It is rice, veggies, eggs and beef is extra. This is their best dish. The only thing I ever order.   I've tried their sushi before and it was pretty nasty. Don't go here for sushi. Their sushi isn't fresh and isn't so great. I've tried other dishes as well like fried rice, beef teriyaki and lunch/ dinner boxes, they were all okay. Nothing too great.   This place is good, but only for Bim Bim Bap. They have the best one in town, hands down."}
{"text":"A nice, little out-of-the-way hidden gem. The gyoza were fresh and succulent and the sushi was top-notch. The service was also remarkably attentive, with plenty of complimentary side dishes that seem to have fallen out of style at newer sushi joints.  Also really dug the ambience-- faded neon late-'80s \"Black Rain\" shtick really added to the experience..."}
{"text":"Must try SASHIMI DON(hwae dup bap) there! The best in the city!"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi place on st.Clair west and dufferin. Must try! Chef Jimmy and his wife Sophie are the nicest people. You will enjoy your dining experience.  The food is so good!"}
{"text":"Had their lunch special. They have a wide range of choices, so you'll never have to settle here. I had the chirashi don as another yelper had suggested.   As with all specials, it came with very good miso soup and fresh salad with a refreshing, tangy and citrus-hinted dressing. Even the tea was really good, not too strong, not too watered down. Yum. Really got my appetite going, and looking forward to the star of my lunch, the chirashi rice bowl.  The chirashi don came with a very good bed of rice that was less sweet than other places, and was more 'umami' (nicely salty). It was a beauty. The rice was covered with a layer of 2 thick pieces of dark-red tuna, 4 very fresh pieces of pink salmon, 2 pieces of white snapper, a sweet and salty cooked ebi (prawn), 2 white pieces of escolar (aka. butterfish), and a beautifully yellow triangular slice of tamago (seasoned cooked egg). Imagine these colors in your bowl, presented to you on the table...it was a festival of colors for my eyes. And the taste? Very good. Not all sashimi were top-notch fresh, but it was fresh enough.   This experience, for the price of $10.95? Yes, please!!!!!!  They also had two or three bento box lunch specials that were priced very moderately starting at $13. That looked good too.  Service was great. Place is very clean. No fishy smell, no oily smell because of the tempura, tables and chairs are very clean.  This place is on a quiet street, but it was quite busy and lots of people came by for pick-up as well.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this place. Of all the North Toronto sushi I have tried, this is by far the best. The portions are generous, and staff is friendly, the food is very fresh. Since owners are Korean, they bring panchan when you sit down, which makes the wait quite pleasant. I think the price point is a tad high, but the quality makes up for it. This is not all-you-can-eat sushi quality, and since it's more upscale, you pay more :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great quality good service. I love having a sushi restaurant of this caliber in this humble neighborhood."}
{"text":"I can't think of a better sushi on the west side. Merest sushi. Great presentation. Underrated."}
{"text":"I got the Toronto roll and spicy white tuna roll. Good environment . Prices aren't bad either. However service is slow even for a slow night. I asked for a refill for my green tea but the waiter forgot. Fail. Probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Much more than just the standard bento boxes and sushi. They have a great variety of donburi. I had a wonderful avocado and tofu salad that had a slight sweet citrus dressing to start. This salad was quite large, so if you do as I did and order this and a donburi you had better be hungry. The Tokyo donburi was amazing. The spicy crab with egg and avocado and salmon had a fresh delicious flavor and was supported by a good amount of tasty sushi rice underneath. If you enjoy tea you will be happy that Tokyo Sushi serves a very good quality green tea with your meal. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is probably closer to 2.5  stars but its nothing special.  Tried some of their interesting items along with some staples.  All were okay but i will not be returning.  Maybe for a quick meal if I'm close by but nothing special here."}
{"text":"It's nice to come here for a non-Friday lunch, grab a seat at the bar and tuck into a spicy salmon don.  You can read the copy of the star they have there in serene semi-privacy and have a delicious and relaxing time.  Everyone at work would be so jealous if they knew what an amazing lunch hour you'd had, so keep this place a secret."}
{"text":"It's aiight. Not the worst. Had the snow white roll which was decent. Tempura lacks that light crunch tho. Supes oily."}
{"text":"Far superior than most sushi joints that scatter Toronto neighbourhoods.  Nothing worse than sushi made with cold rice which is often the norm at many sushi spots.  At Tokyo Sushi the soft warm rice compliments the cold sushi perfectly.   Staff are friendly and fish very good quality"}
{"text":"This place was good. Came here tonight with a friend of mine, we decided to give this place a shot. Service was quick and friendly.   Food was good. I didn't like the shrimp tempura I found it had too much batter. I ordered a dynamite roll and it was delicious.   They gave us a complimentary noodle entree while we're waiting for our food.  Overall the food seemed fresh and tasted good.   I'm not too sure if I'd be back here though as there are many similar spots to this one. It didn't \"wow\" me."}
{"text":"Second time here. Restaurant is clean, service is good and attentive, private booths. Excuse me for not remembering the exact names of dishes...  We were there on a sunday afternoon and hung out for a few hours. Slowly ordering items and hot sake. We were brought a free tofu dish that was amazing. The tofu was fresh with a delicious sauce. Complementary green tea as always, and free watermelon at the end of the meal. The white tuna sashimi is amazing! fresh, buttery flavour, melts in your mouth delicious. We ordered 4 orders haha.  The dragon roll (I believe we got) was good. It was large to share.  We moved on to ordering a noodle dish. Here they loose 1/2 a star because they don't have much selection. Most noodle dishes come in a broth. So we ordered the only noodle vegetarian dish and ordered the Chicken skewer appy on the side to have with it. The Chicken skewer appy is so tasty! The noodle dish was ok, could use a bit more flavour but was good with the addition of chicken satay skewer. The wonton soup is $3 and comes with two dumplings, either pork or vegetarian. It was good but I was too full to eat it. They have low sodium soya sauce. With tip, tax, two orders of sake and all this food was $85. A little pricy but all the sashimi adds up."}
{"text":"This place is amaaaaazing! All you can eat for $15 is a great price and the food was delicious. Their dragon eye roll and fried tofu were my favourites. Their tempura shrimp was light and super crispy. Enjoyed it and will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I live less than five minutes from this place and yet it's taken me five years to try it out. don't let my mistake be yours. while a glance at the menu reveals nothing new or unusual, as with all great sushi joints, what puts Tokyo ahead of the rest is its style.  soup and salad are standard issue but at Tokyo, the miso dressing is top notch. also you get yam noodles as an app which is a lovely treat.   I'm a wakame fanatic. the portion here is bigger than average for an average price, $4, plus it comes with cucumber, avocado, and a bunch of other trimmings that once again make it just that much more special.  to start my buddy and I split some veggie tempura, more than enough for both of us to snack on for just $4. my vegetarian maki and sushi set, $10.95 for 18 pieces, was just right. not too much rice, fresh fillings, served at exactly the right temperature. my buddy had a beautiful bento box with chicken and sushi, and he said it was top notch.  during the dinner hour, I will remain loyal to my College St fave, Sashimi Island: the variety of their vegetarian offerings is greater and the price is right. but Tokyo is open for lunch - HUGE bonus for someone who works weird hours - and a lone swordsman on a strip that offers little else in the way of Japanese cuisine. (Mazz doesn't get my business, you have to take out a line of credit to eat there and it's just not worth the price when you're veg.)  bravo, Tokyo, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with a few of my friends the other night and I have to admit that this place is pretty adorable.   The decor is nice and clean. Love the autographed photos of celebrities that have been there hung proudly on their walls.   Their menu is pretty vast from sashimi/sushi combos, bento boxes, to sharable appetizers. Everything was made fresh to order. The quality of everything was beyond my expectations for this place.   We had ordered 4 different bento boxes and some appetizers and sushi to share. The only thing that I wish I could change about this place would be the speed of the service. Don't get me wrong, they are very friendly and have the ability to make you feel very welcomed. However, the service was pretty slow. Sometimes it felt like we had to flag someone down just to get tea refills but it was pretty busy and they only had two servers at the time we were there.   So, with all that being said, if you fancy yourself a good time with friends that can carry a conversation accompanied with some great Japanese food than come on down to this place. You'll love it! =)"}
{"text":"Family run place that provides great service. The food is tasty, I ordered the vegetable udon soup and was pleased that there was actually a substantial amount of vegetables, some places only put cabbage and call it vegetable udon."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, cause my fella loves it. It's always fine, never appalling, but has nothing to recommend it. Today I ended up there because I was starving and it was the sushi place I passed. I was a bit surprised at the very limited selection of lunch special options, but not particularly disappointed. 'Specials' tend to be sort of blah at sushi places anyway.   As in the past the experience today was fine. Service was fine - though I'll give points because I didn't wait for anything and I didn't need to flag my server down to get the bill. The spicy hamachi make was actually fantabulous - complex and zesty - but the seaweed salad was lacklustre, so the food balanced out to just fine.   Tokyo sushi does nothing to offend me, but it does nothing to commend itself either."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I've given it plenty of chances over a 4 year period and every single time I have gone the service has been nothing short of terrible. First time I went I waited a full hour before my cucumber maki rolls arrived (the waitress, who had replaced my first waiter was very upset that I did not leave a full 15% tip and proceeded to berate me for it, didn't seem to care that she wasn't the one serving me for the full hour/the fact I waited an hour for one order of maki rolls).  The next few times I went I was with a group for the all you can eat buffet. Each time several orders just never came out and, I guess as a response to people not tipping the horrible wait staff, they insisted that a 15% \"mandatory gratuity charge\" be placed on everyone's bills automatically. The last time I refused to pay it and one of the wait staff threatened to kick us out (even though we were all just trying to pay our bills). The manager was absolutely no help to either us or his wait staff.   The food is OK, but unfortunately you have to battle with the completely inept and rude wait staff to get it."}
{"text":"A total hole in the wall (try to avoid the washroom since its past the kitchen, in a supply closet) but the sushi is amazingly good. Sushi and sashimi is always nicely cut and fresh - but definitely try the Osaka (eel+), Rainbow (Salmon+) and Spicy Scallop rolls. They also do takeout and great party trays. Great lunch specials during the week. Yes, a little pricier than some other places (like the Annex standards) but well worth it. I've been to Hiro and like this place better."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. It's good that they have a liquor license now because sushi needs sake or Sapporo. The rolls are great and fresh. The workers always great the guests with a friendly Japanese hello as you walk in. The ocean roll is to die for as well as the seared tuna. This is a good little place that unfortunately is often over looked but it's quite a gem"}
{"text":"Great sushi! My boyfriend and I go for sushi pretty often and order several rolls and pretty much eat til we feel sick. We ordered sushi pizza and 6 rolls. The waitress told us that was too much food, and to order 4 rolls. We thought this was a bit weird, but went ahead with 4 rolls and our pizza and would order more if we wanted. The waitress was right! We could hardly finish the 4 rolls we ordered! The rolls are huge, I've never seen sushi that big before. And the sushi pizza, omg. There's spicy mayo and cream cheese on it. The cream cheese is what really makes it good. This is now our go to sushi place, which is great because it's close by. I've also ordered for take out and my order is always done quick!"}
{"text":"Excellent sashimi.  I have been looking for a decent mom and pop sushi spot in Toronto for a long time and this place nails it.  Great food.  Very fresh Toro and hamachi."}
{"text":"We recently found this place based on Yelp assisted sushi outing.  This is a small place that is tucked away on a side street between other business. I have driven and walked by this place a few times, without even noticing it was there before.  We visited on a weekend for a late dinner. This is a small place with simple deco.  It reminds me of the sushi bars in Japan where there are only a few tables and caters to the local.  In total, there were around 8 tables in this place.  When we got in, we were the only people there. We were greeted warmly by both the chefs and the waitress.   Within 10 minutes a few other customer came in and the place is now over half full...   Our sashimi platter came quickly. Everything was very fresh and tasty. The size of the fish was appropriate unlike some of the other sushi places which goes for quantity over quality.  We enjoyed out night out. The place is low key and not about flash. Prices was a bit tad higher than other places."}
{"text":"The owner was extremely rude, the sushi was not fresh and was discolored. There were also many dead flies on my table. How is this an acceptable dining experience in Toronto?"}
{"text":"By far the best quality sushi in the area. I highly recommend the sashimi here - the fish is so fresh and tender. The albacore tuna that comes with most of the sashimi combos is particularly tasty.  Every time we come here, the owners go above and beyond to make sure we are well served and satisfied with the meal. Often, the chef even treats us to special dishes that he's trying out, which can't be found on the menu.  We will be coming back here often."}
{"text":"I've never actually tried the sushi here but the last two times I've been here was for the chicken curry rice with croquettes on the side.  Its decent, but the croquettes are the best part of the meal. The service was always friendly, and the ambience is quite cosy.  I do think this place is too pricey though given the small portion sizes. The chicken in their curry rice tastes and looks like tofu which resulted in a small incident the last time I visited.  I won't go back, but based on other reviews, it seems their sushi is quite the stunner. So if you're going there for the \"cooked food\" items, then your best bet is somewhere else!"}
{"text":"This place was not at my list at first. I checked it out just because the one I want to go was not open. I order the K sashimi don. It got different toppings with other chirashi I had got, like eel, uni, roe and even egg. I like the eel and roe. But for the uni, salmon and tuna, it is not fresh.  The rice is the worst I have ever had. It is not bad, but compared to the ones I had before, it is really disappointing. It is sticky like usual sushi rice and they did not flavor it."}
{"text":"I was suspicious coming in as this was a foreign place on corso italia but it was amazing. The crab salad is the best i ever had the tuna was great although the avocado roll could have been better"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday evening. Pretty quiet but a reasonable turnover of customers, always a good sign. Nice restaurant and ambience and the service was quick, friendly and efficient. Food was very good too and the bill was reasonable. Will definitely be returning. Recommended."}
{"text":"When I want to experience some yelling and real attitude, this is my no1 choice.  The food is okay but some of the serveur(se) have some serious problems."}
{"text":"The restaurant is kind of outdated but very good fresh sushi. The owners are very nice and generous for take out-ers. There are lots of regular and return customers."}
{"text":"This is one of the hidden secrets of Toronto. One of the best Sushi which you will found around town. It is a bit pricey for a local neighborhood sushi place, but still worth the money... try to Volcano roll and you will love it. It has many 10 seatings so we aware to book a place in advance (although it is never too busy).  the staff are very friendly. they also do delivery in the neighborhood and surely do take out."}
{"text":"We only came because pie commission isn't open and we were hungry and nothing much is around so we just stop and the only place open is this. We order a noodle soup and a sushi dinner.   1) over priced 2) poor quality- fish weren't very fresh, rice was too soft and not favoured. Chicken is over cook. Sushi was worst than supermarket sushi 3) poor service. choice of music was questionable (90's video game music!?) no one came to check if we have enough tea  For sure not coming back again"}
{"text":"I went because of the 5 star reviews on here. It was pretty mediocre as far as I'm concerned. The fish wasn't bad such that I was worried I might get sick or anything, but it was far from the freshest I've had in Toronto. It was well assembled and presented on the plate, portions were decent but it was a little bit on the pricey side.  Service was friendly but fairly poor, we never saw the waitress other then to quickly take our order and to drop off our plates and the place was nearly empty so it wasn't that they were too busy. Some water would have been nice.  If I lived next door I might return to this place, but as there are better choices at equal distance for me I am unlikely to return."}
{"text":"Good and quick service for take out! The salmon sushi pizza was a little oily though and not much salmon on there"}
{"text":"Just had lunch. Had the chicken teriyaki box. Food was quick to come. Free appetizers were great."}
{"text":"I went here after craving some sushi, and i certainly got my fill!  The service is not the best known to man, and I was there on a quiet night with 5 wait staff..  As for the food, you have to order a truck load to get your moneys worth, but that is to be expected at an all you can eat. The sushi seemed fresh, but the rice was a little too mushy. It was still tasty though. Teriyaki Beef was very nice, I could have eaten that all night, but chose not to. The tempura prawns weren't anything special, the batter wasn't as light a most tempura dishes.  Overall it is not a bad place, but certainly a once off. It is cash only, and don't expect to get any change... A little over priced, but good food nonetheless."}
{"text":"Excellent service, and love the presentation of the dishes. Often compliment with free appetizers. Very nice interior. Much prefer over the next door Fukui Sushi"}
{"text":"This place still has the best salad dressing in town which, very honestly, is the only reason I come back.  As a vegetarian, I often order Avocado/Cucumber maki which, if you know anything about sushi, is a pretty tough thing to screw up. Still, 4 out of every 5 times I've gone here, they serve me unripe avocado in BOTH the green salad and the maki. Avocado is NOT a fruit you can eat when it's unripe.   Sadly, each time I mention this problem, the server/sushi chef seem wholly unconcerned, even irritated that it's a problem. As you may imagine, I have stopped going here -- it's not worth the hassle. Still, they really do have the best salad dressing around."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in downtown. I don't know how they make them so delicious but wow! My favourite dish is the spicy lobster roll."}
{"text":"Good range of prices and choices, and fast service! Nice small, quiet local place I would definitely go back to."}
{"text":"Not good at all. We went there for Mother's Day and were excited to visit this busy place. I had the chicken teriyaki, and the chicken tasted like it had been refrigerated for a long time. I didn't end up finishing it. The steamed veggies were okay, and it was nice that they served appetizers beforehand. My mom did not like her food either. I would have given this place 2 stars but what really made this experience not worthwhile was the fact that I had to ask 2 times and wait almost 20 minutes for the bill. Why did they quickly serve the table next to us and have us wait for so long? It's not like they thought that we were going to eat more, as the servers had already cleared our table. Even though the price was decent and the servings were just right in terms of portion size, (unless you are a big eater), the bad chicken and the inconsistent service just did it for me. I'm definitely not going back to this one."}
{"text":"That was the best sushi I ate so far. I wish somebody warned me that in some of the sushi is wasabi ( it was hot ) but taste was amazing. Price is equal to quality."}
{"text":"All I can say the food is expensive for the quality, and the service is actually not good, especially the cashier"}
{"text":"I used to like this place very much because the people are friendly and kind, the service is great, the food is always fresh and the quality control is good. The reason i went there a lot because their fish is always fresh, and they actually care about the little details. But after they move to the bigger place next door this summer. My experience changed. The service is not as friendly anymore, and sometimes the salad is not fresh. I mean the food still tastes okay, but not as good as before. Maybe because the store got bigger so its harder to do quality control??   if you havent been to this place give it a try, their spicy salmon don is great. If you have been there before i have to tell you the quality has gone down."}
{"text":"Amazing food, but terrible service. Their miso soup is made completely different than how other sushi places make it. I was served a big bowl of soup with huge cubes of tofu, mushrooms, green onions and shredded lettuce, and some vermicelli. I'm not sure if Tokyo Sushi's way is authentic,but it sure was good. The rolls were quite really tasty, too. They make delicious dynamite rolls for sure.   The service was pretty bad. No one ever came over to my table to do anything. After waiting forever, I finally had to call someone over to take my order. They also forgot to give me my drink and I had to ask again. After I got my food and ate, I waited over 20 minutes for my bill to come. I had to ask for that, too! They even took a while to give me my change.  I guess if I'm not in a rush, I'd go back again. I can overlook the bad service because the food was so good. By the way, this place is cash only."}
{"text":"had the regular grilled chicken plate combo!! chicken portion was amazing and great quality!!"}
{"text":"the worse sushi place : food was cheap quality, service as bad of the food. they chared us almost 8$ more for the service already on the bill. for 2 people it was 70$ ! i will never pay that much to eat so cheap. to avoid absolutely."}
{"text":"I recently moved into the area a couple of months ago and was looking for a sushi restaurant in the area. Happened to discover this place and after reading the reviews, I was quite surprised as it lived up to it's expectations.   Went last night was offered complimentary crystal noodles (the Korean style) as an app. The fish here are very fresh as I ordered the tuna tataki, mixed sashimi roll and sakura roll. Rolls did not fall apart although they were quite big in size as well. Was offered complementary strawberry ice cream in the end along with a 10% discount.   Great food and service. Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Food is good, Unagi don, gyu don, sushi, sashimi all good, I order from them quite often coz food is good and it's down my building, but not happy about the high price tag, especially if you want to eat here regularly."}
{"text":"My two cousins, brother and I came here on a Friday night for dinner. I was so hungry I was ready for ayce anything lol. My cousin suggested this place and we immediately got to ordering. The place looked very tiny but cozy and traditional.  I settled on a chirashi donburi ($14.95) and takoyaki ($5/6pcs). My cousin ordered the Tokyo chirashi donburi ($16.95) while my other cousin and brother got bento box c and e. They also shared an Osaka roll ($8.95/8pcs). All of our food came with miso soup and a garden salad as well.   Upon ordering, our waitress also brought over one of the chefs to clarify the orders which I thought was a very personal and attentive gesture.   The food came promptly and was so delicious! There was a good assortment of fish that tasted very fresh along with a nice portion of well seasoned rice underneath. The takoyaki was hot, fluffy and creamy with a great chew from the octopus inside. Soo good!  Overall, I know I was incredibly hungry to start but I finished my meal feeling so stuffed and satisfied! Even days after having that chirashi don, I had a massive craving for it every meal. Recommend!"}
{"text":"I was there in late March on the weekend at around 5:00 for AYCE.  Food was fine, and service was fast.  Some portions were on the small side, so I just placed additional orders.  1 order didn't show up so I just re-ordered. Not sure why they made me pay before I got my meal, which seemed a bit odd to me."}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall lunch stop just off Bay (at St. Joseph). The thing that makes this place special is the donburi/churachi bowls. There are lots of options on the menu and most are not lacking in taste. The portions are lunch sized.  My personal favourite is the Tokyo bowl; salmon, shitaki mushrooms, tuna, avacado, immitation crab,  and sea cucumber. Glutinos will need to ask them to not add the tempura flakes.  Most bowls are less than $15, the food come quick and are served with cheap salad and miso soup. A great spot for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Cannot stop going. The sushi is so fresh and quick. Personal favourite: spicy salmon don. Yum!"}
{"text":"has walked pasted by the sushi place many many times over the last 2 yrs living here, and i finally went in there. definitely like the food there, simple but special!(not those fast food taste, but sushi~) will come back again!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good. Now the portion got so small for the price I'm paying... I found hair in my food and a small cockroach on the floor.."}
{"text":"The one with the plain white rice sushi and yellow coloured white snapper.  My friends and I just ordered two platters and we're now on our way to a grocery store for sashimi because even that would have to be better than what we had. The only reason we ordered from here was because it was on Just-Eat.ca and we wanted to try the service out.   The sushi was plain white rice sushi without any vinegar taste and all of the rolls were flavourless. There was white snapper that was yellow in color and questionable in whether it was safe to eat. I highly suggest you think twice before you consider ordering from this place."}
{"text":"This is my regular sushi joint. Always fresh food and friendly staff, it's hard for me to eat at other places since I've tried their sushi. My fav...spicy salmon rolls"}
{"text":"The food is great, but what makes me come back here is the service. The owners really seem to care how my overall experience is. The staff is always so welcoming and warm, they feel like family at this point.   Their prices are also a plus! Great quality for a cheap meal.   I recommend their bento boxes and chicken teriyaki roll and sushi pizza!"}
{"text":"Not too shabby for an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant, especially in Montreal. Definitely a step closer to good sushi when compared to Kanda Sushi, which is also in the area. The nigiri sushi is decent but not too much of a variety. (Still trying to figure out what oily fish is?!?) The sushi pizza was strange, yet interesting. The maki rolls were decent, and the non-sushi items were just as you would expect from a buffet. We went for lunch, which was around $16 per person including taxes. I believe dinner is a bit steeper. We stayed for around two hours to try and take advantage of the deal, and realized the service was spotty. They either took our orders right away or took forever to retrieve our next one.   Would go back for the lunch prices, but will still continue to tackle Montreal's plethora of sushi places."}
{"text":"Love it that they give you real chopsticks and offer any sushi with brown rice. Awesome service, and soul satisfying sushi."}
{"text":"The taste of the sushi was okay but the service was good. I had salmon maki and an octopus hand roll. The octopus was on the boring side, the seaweed didn't seem fresh and crunchy.   The fish was fresh but it was missing some flavour - too much on the average side of things I felt."}
{"text":"The food tasted off. Though service is good.  The miso soup taste off..a bit sour for some reason. The avocado salmon roll was too sweet..?! The tonksu was heavily covered in batter, with some raw veggies drowned in teriyaki sauce.   This is the worst sushi place I tried."}
{"text":"We ordered the sushi boat and a few bottle of beer and it was okay.  We had miso soup at first but it was very blended. Unfortunately, we did not enjoy some of the sushi it because the fish was not fresh.  This sushi place is average like other Japanese restaurant in GTA.   It would be so much better if they have more authentic Japanese beer."}
{"text":"Service was great, we ordered the sushi and sashimi combo A - our server was very thorough, explained to us the different types of fish and checked up on us during the meal. Sashimi and sushi was nice and thick, and extremely fresh. Good variability in terms of lean and fatty fish. Looking forward to try the chirashi next time!"}
{"text":"Great sushi!   I can tell they take pride in quality ingredients and artful food creation. fresh and naturally flavorful, just how sushi should be."}
{"text":"Love this place! The sushi and sashimi is consistently fresh and flavourful.  In addition, Jimmy  and his wonderful wife Sophia are two of the sweetest people and always make us feel right at home. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I was a full-time sushi chef for 3 years so I'm rather picky about the quality of my sushi rolls. I found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try.  I came in on a Sunday at 5:30pm and it was not very busy. Service was extremely fast. I'm actually broke so I kept my meal under $15. I ordered basic rolls: Shitakii mushroom (6 pcs $3.50), Yam (6 pcs $4), Spicy salmon (6 pcs $4.50). My bill was $14.04 before TIP. They definitely could have added more shitakii and yam into their rolls (believe me I know). But the rolls were pretty good for the price, and they didn't break when I picked them up.  I'll definitely come back later to try the Special Rolls when I'm not poor. The servers checked up on me a couple of times to see if I needed anything so I never had a problem with service.  It's a small venue so I wonder what it's like on a busy day? They take credit, and debit as payment (minimum $10). Cash too of course. I'm coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"I live nearby and there are a lot of other sushi places around the area, but I always end up going to Tokyo sushi. It's cozy, the food is always delicious - one of the best salmon dons I've had in the city! - and the service friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Weirdly, just noticed that my wife has also reviewed this place--full disclosure. BUT: like...we mostly don't even come here together.   I'm not sure that this place would handle a real meal of nigiri---say. BUT: if you want a delicious don dish, and you want fish that is not gross. This place is better than all but a handful of places in Toronto. WAY WAY WAY better than bloor street student sushi."}
{"text":"Best maki I've ever had! The green dragon is great, has so much shrimp and the veggies were very fresh. Teriyaki chicken is alright, though there was a bit too much sauce and was a fairly small portion for the price. Would definitely recommend for the sushi and maki! Much better than the other Tokyo sushi (unrelated) that's closer to avenue rd."}
{"text":"The last handfull of times I've been to this venue, I've been rather disappointed. More often than not, when I order for pick-up and arrive back to work, I realize they've forgotten to include something (one of the times I noticed before leaving, but most of the times it's smaller things that are harder to notice). Also on one occurrence I asked them if it's possible to place a lunch-sized order during dinner hours and they said \"yes\" and when I arrived to pick it up, I was given the dinner-priced & sized version of what I ordered.  So all-in-all, while I love the mushrooms they place in their miso soup as well as the rice they use and most of the time the over-all quality of the food they have, I would hesitate to return again to this venue anytime soon."}
{"text":"So far, this is the best sushi we've had in Toronto. Okay, that's not saying a lot since we haven't tried a lot of places. Nevertheless, we were very happy with the quality and while not the cheapest, wasn't too bad for the amount of food we had.  Ordered: Wakame - good and cheap. Above average anyway. Kamikaze Don - a different kind of don, as there was very little rice (would've liked more), but the ingredients were fresh and tasty. Oyako Roll - not bad, but too much radish Volcano Roll - very tasty! Couldn't really taste the salmon skin though. Lobster Roll - by far my favourite of the night. Lots of flavour. Aji (wild mackerel) - fresh and super tasty. Would definitely order again.  The way they rolled the rice wasn't too dense, which was really nice. Service was quite good as well.  Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner and order the sashimi dinner combo and one of the dinner combos with steak.   Pros:  - the sashimi pieces are huge!  - the server was attentive  - service was quick - the rolls had just the right amount of rice  Cons: - the sashimi dinner didn't have a great variety. More than half of the pieces were salmon or white fish.  The restaurant is close by so I would definitely go back or do take out."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible!   Got takeout from there today and it was a disaster! Beef teriyaki bento had no soup or salad. shrimp tempura was the size of great peas and super dry! Rice was sticky and need not cooked at all! I also ordered kamikaze Roll and there were only 4 pieces! I couldn't finish any of the items on my plate, so gross. stay away!"}
{"text":"Great service & food. The space is a bit tight so you may hear someone else's conversation by accident but otherwise really good!"}
{"text":"Only came here because my friend was craving for sushi and we reached a compromise - to go somewhere with sushi and Korean food..  as this is not a Korean eatery, don't expect refills for banchan.  portion sizes a tad bit small. service is so-so.   this place seems rather run-down and not all that good.  I ordered the spicy beef soup (Korean menu, at the very back). it comes with miso soup, a small piece of tofu with soy sauce, and a small serving of VERY salty, un-fermented kimchi. in case you don't know, the usual kimchi is fermented - that's the tang that you can taste when you bite into the cabbage leaves. but this napa cabbage kimchi is quite limp and soggy - and it wasn't cold enough.   i was picky enough to ask for gochujang so i can eat it with my bowl of rice. short grain rice is served - the usual kind found in Japanese and Korean restaurants, with s bit of stickiness to it. rice was good.  maybe it was the kimchi that ruined my dinner. but I will NOT come back again."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi place in Toronto. They have fresh sushi at good prices, and service is consistently excellent. The restaurant is small, quiet, and charming - good for all occasions."}
{"text":"They use to be on time delivering food within an hour or around an hour. Now it keeps taking them more than 2 hrs. Will definitely not order from them again. One star given only for the food."}
{"text":"I needed a new place for Salmon Oyako Don after Tokyo Kitchen closed down.  I saw this place, and hoped it could be a replacement.  The fish is not as fresh.  The sushi rice is very over seasoned and uses Korean style rice.  Also,  the waitress and sushi chef tried to scam me by insisting that tobiko was the same as ikura (charging me the ikura price, $18 for oyako don).  When I persisted that tobiko was not salmon roe, they relented and gave me my ikura on top as 'extra' (knowing full well their 'mistake').  They did not want to make new one. That is very bad business practice.  This will be my first and last time here.  Be careful what you order here.    We did not receive a refill of our tea unless asked (we were the only couple in the restaurant), and the water we asked for never came.  My partner thought his kamikaze don was okay.  But it is $19 or $20 for a small portion.  Aoyama/Shinobu prices for sushi on bloor quality."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Great quick non-intrusive service. Friendly owner! Fresh sushi! I had spicy tuna, dynamite roll, and veg fried dumpling. All delicious!  Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Only been here for lunch - and was impressed every time.  I love the chirashi don (sashimi or raw fish on sushi rice).  Always fresh, and decent size portions.  Service is quick and friendly, and the restaurant itself is quaint and cute.  Prices are reasonable too!  Will come back again!  :)"}
{"text":"I told Kathy that she may choose any restaurant in the city, and I will treat her to her heart's content. From the amber lights of Sotto Sotto, to the arrogance of staring down at pedestrians while sipping wine from the Shangri-la bar--Toronto was her oyster. So when she said \"Tokyo Sushi\", the thought of sushi was all I could use to keep my head from falling off. There is such a thing as being 'too' down to Earth.   Finding parking is harder than finding true love on the street this restaurant is located. A short winding stretching the length of two buildings that would never conjure tourist or locals to tilt their heads to look, the unassuming restaurant is gilded with photos of Hollywood celebrities that have actually eaten here. Makes sense, celebrities don't have to park their own cars.   Two sushi chefs, one waitress and a bus boy manned the empty restaurant. Kathy and I took our seats and began scrolling through the massive menu. The sea urchin was out of season, so my wallet breathed a sigh of relief. I didn't like sea urchin anyway, Kathy was disappointed, and so I got us the soft shell crab, and Kirin beer.    Miso soup, tako wasa, spider roll, salmon roe sushi, squid (10 pcs), jumbo dragon roll, herring roe sashimi, jumbo dragon roll again, soft shell crab. Oh yes, I kept the receipt.  I never had squid sashimi before, and I wouldn't have been such a big fan if it weren't for the highly unique and flavourful sauce it came with. The texture was completely different from when it's cooked, but I managed to gobble down at least four pieces. The jumbo dragon roll was worth ordering again. The waitress was surprised to receive another order from me when she initially approached us for the bill. The sushi chefs were very pleased with this gesture of hunger, and made the second serving extra special. I could just tell they did.  As Kathy and I sat in this sushi house, I pondered the walls for excuses to place negative judgment. I couldn't really find any. I know that this isn't completely reflective of the sushi in Tokyo, there is absolutely a whitewashing of the food, but it was good, and retained enough of its authentic characteristic that I didn't feel pretentious ordering the Japanese beer, despite it being Japanese industrial beer.  Can we change that? Can we start importing Japanese craft beer? Those guys won the international awards more than anyone in the modern world!  My palate is beyond adventurous, but I did have to summon up some courage to devour that octopus sashimi. I wonder how the Korean do it eating that thing whole, alive with no garnish. Crazy savages. Definitely on the bucket list."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, tasty tender and fresh sushi - all for a reasonable price! We usually go to Sushi California, but their wait times are getting ridiculous. Tokyo Sushi is at least as good, and we had a great evening of sashimi and nigiri all presented in a traditional wood boat. We have been here twice now, lunch and dinner, and it was an excellent meal both times. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here out of convenience and was pleasantly surprised by the quiet, clean ambiance and the delicious food!   We used the Yelp check in and got 1 free pop per person. Also complimentary during our meal was a garden salad, miso soup, and fresh cut oranges to finish the meal! I can't forget the chef offered us these wonderful bite sized crab, smoked salmon, and cream cheese wrapped in cucumber on a toothpick! I love these nice touches that make our business feel so valued!   Beyond that we also ordered the torched sushi appetizer, shrimp tempura appetizer, green dragon roll, and my favourite, the love me roll! All highly recommended and would re-order.   Everything was really fresh and exceptionally prepared. More than earned this 5 star reviewed."}
{"text":"Taste is very nice and price is also good  server was very kind to me  I recommend to choose this restaurant if you want to eat sushi and roll  best sushi restaurant ever"}
{"text":"good sushi, good prices and super friendly owner and staff. Very accommodating for party platters, and great service for sit in and take out as well. The veggie tempura roll is so good they always have something a bit different in their rolls then other places which makes this place nice and unique."}
{"text":"Tokyo Sushi offers poor quality food at high prices. The sashimi in their deluxe chirashi was not fresh, especially the uni, which had most definitely spoiled. Their unagi don, for $17, had an extremely inadequate amount of food. The unagi don at Tokyo Grill just around the corner is only $12 and has more eel. This restaurant also tried to scam me on multiple occasions by charging more than the price indicated on the menu. Don't make the same mistake I did and take your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Gah - Tokyo Sushi is such a frustrating restaurant. One day the food is great and the service is amazing. The next day, it's the worst restaurant and service in town. I hate the inconsistency but you get what you pay for I guess?? I try to avoid coming here as much as possible, but sometimes when a craving for sushi kicks in, it's just convenient to walk over and deal with the surprising service of the day!"}
{"text":"Very good all you can eat! Very large variety on menu and delicious."}
{"text":"Not the prettiest of places however it serves the best sushi I have ever had. Try the Spicy tuna crunch!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Tokyo Sushi location a few times, as it's located just a block away from a friend's apartment. The interior is really nice and clean and the service is just amazing. We've had the same waitress each time we've been in and she's been so incredibly polite and friendly. She always repeats our orders to make sure she's gotten everything down correctly and didn't get bothered at all when we asked for separate bills (in fact, she even remembered that and asked on our next visit back if we wanted separate bills).  The prices for everything seem pretty average for most Japanese places. Some things were a little cheaper than other places, some a little bit more expensive. I've ordered a california roll, dynamite roll, miso soup, ebi nigiri and I've tried out the vegetable tempura. Everything tasted great but just as a warning to anyone who doesn't like wasabi - the nigiri sushi is served with some wasabi hidden between the rice and fish. I found out about this the hard way. XD   I don't have a single bad thing to say about this place. The service is amazing and the food is great. :D"}
{"text":"This is a quaint and small restaurant tucked away on a side street. The food is great, service is fast, and the owners and waiters are very friendly.   Their lunch menu is only available on weekdays.  The chirashi don lunch is 12.5, but it's a bit different from the dinner chirashi. I suggest replacing the salad for seaweed salad for an extra $1, because the regular salad is just iceberg lettuce with a tomato on top.  Veggie Curry Don/udon is $9, $10 for beef or chicken curry, 10.5 for croquette. Gindara $18."}
{"text":"I came in Lunch for takeout, and surprisingly the place was quite peaceful. The waiter was kind and cheerful. I waited about 5 minutes for my Oyaka Don A and it comes with a small bowl of salad and miso soup. It was really good, the rice was warm and the salmon and ikura was room temperature."}
{"text":"Came for the first time while we were downtown, I was pleasantly surprised. Food was inexpensive and the quality was excellent. Started with a seaweed salad ($2.95), and miso soup. Both were very tasty. Miso soup ($1.50) was not bland I highly recommend you try here. For the sushi we had: spicy salmon, salmon avacado, spicy tuna and red dragon rolls. All were excellent. Fish was fresh and they were generous with the portions ( see pictures). All maki rolls ranged from $4.95 to $ 5.75. Red dragon roll was $13 but still worth it. You have the option of sitting at the sushi bar, open tables, or Japanese style booths. Food was excellent. Great place to go on a casual date or to hang out with friends. Servers were nice and service is fast. Their greeen tea ice cream here is imported from japan...delicious! Its hidden but worth it if you go inside!"}
{"text":"You don't really get the food you ordered.  We ordered salmon hand rolls and got salmon avocado hand rolls.  It's probably ok unless you don't like avocado with salmon, which is our case.  I ordered a toro hand roll that was price at $6.95 on the menu.  But they charged me 12.95 when I got the check.  The waitress explained they don't have the kind of toro on the menu so they gave me the other kind of toro that's more expensive.  But why didn't they tell me? You can not switch my order without telling me.  I paid my bill with 15% tip as I usually do.  But i won't go back because I don't TRUST them. On top that, the rice is cold and the seaweed is not crispy."}
{"text":"Had Chirashi. Salmon was good. Salad dressing had too much ginger. Washroom door could not close. Biggest group they can accommodate is six. I don't like how they hardly have anything in the sushi fridge at the bar"}
{"text":"I tried this place a few years ago. They had a variety of selections of dons. The food was OK."}
{"text":"Wow!  I was just in the mood for sushi one afternoon with a friend, stumbled upon this place that I hadn't been to.  There were no patrons inside so I figured I'd give them some business.  Boy was I glad I did!  I ordered the spicy salmon roll, california roll and chicken teriyaki roll, along with miso soup and spicy tofu.  I was blown away by the full flavour of just the California roll.  Our server was polite and the food was out in about 10 minutes, all freshly prepared.  Moderately priced too from what I could tell is one of the more upscale sushi joints in the city.  Great food and excellent service.  I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"If you want cheap all-you-can-eat sushi for lunch, this place is alright. It gets pricey for dinner and it's not really worth it.  The service on the other hand, is horrendous. After being seated and giving our order to the waiter, we had to ask 3 times to get wasabi and ginger. We ordered from the all you can eat menu a couple of times and each time, almost half the order was \"forgotten.\" We were there for over an hour, and not once did we have a waiter come ask us if we wanted anything to drink or if we wanted to order more. Each time, even for more tea, we had to flag down one of the frantic waiters.  Finally we asked for the bill and again, had to ask a couple of times before it came.   Since sushi places seem to be fairly common in downtown Montreal, I wouldn't bother coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Didn't like it at all.  Poor service, poorly made rolls. We ordered the boat - which was ok.   There are other decent sushi places nearby."}
{"text":"Initially my friend took me here and I was okay with it. But the next few times I've went really changed my mind. The customer service is terrible - they were rude to my friends and I the moment they found out we weren't getting the buffet service. The sushi is okay...nothing spectacular. I also had a udon...and my stomach turned all night.. Not a nice experience. Let's say I will not be coming back, regardless how fair the price is."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Seaweed salad not your standard salad, it was on a bed of anise, and topped with avocado and cucumber. The waitress brought over complimentary sample of sweet potato noodle, nice and light, great texture. The salmon topped dynamite role was fresh.Finished with a complimentary piece of fresh melon. Great dinning experience overall."}
{"text":"A la carte menu and all-you-can-eat Japanese food.  I can't speak to the pricing, but the service is very friendly.  At dinner time, the quality of the all-you-can-eat menu items varies, and the quantity in selection of items is pretty standard. In general, the hot stuff just passable - think food court (e.g. yakitori - overly sweet and sparse, even as far as skewers go, and the tempura batter is thick, stodgy, and oily). rolls and sashimi are good, but that's all.    Standard."}
{"text":"From the signed Lou gossette jr photo it appears this restaurant has been a successful hidden gem for quite a while.  Me and my date had the pleasure of trying out the blackened cod, uni sushi, spicy crab n salmon donburi and kamikaze donburi.  There was generous portion of uni on top of flavorful rice. The cod was succulent and flaked easily. While both donburi were balanced and well seasoned, not too much rice and plentiful toppings. I'll definitely return, now that it no longer is hidden from me.  The pricing is reasonably priced and what you come to expect for a sushi restaurant, expect to pay 20-40 per person depending on if you order extra appetizers. A decent meal can be had for $16-25."}
{"text":"This hidden jem, just walking distance from my home is so far the best sushi experience I've had in Canada.   They have my new favourite, Uni, and it is fresher than anywhere else I had it! Because they order small batches and never keep it for more than 1-2 days the taste is always the same: sweet, tangy and resets your brain instantly to believe you're on the seaside ;). (Freshness comes at the price that this item is not always available... ask for it, and about 70% of the time you'll get to taste this amasing delicacy)  Chef Soon Heung Im (aka. Jimmy Im) knows everything about Japanese and Korean cuisine, and often amazes with an artistic presentation that you otherwise would only expect in a posh place boosting a Michelin star or too. But this place is anything but posh... it is a lovely family spot that his wife warms up with her kind and attentive presence.  With no compromises in freshness this place is most fairly priced, and I only eat sushi in other places when this one is too far ;)  Come in... you'll feel like family before the first bite!"}
{"text":"Decent Sushi place in a pinch. Came here last night with a friend. Had a bento box with Dynamite Rolls. The starter miso was okay but the salad was a bit limp and didn't have a very good dressing.   The box was pretty decent, including sashimi, yam rolls, California rolls and my Dynamite Rolls. Took awhile to come out but everything was good but not exceptional    Price for everything including tax and tip was 23$   Service was good, with lots of refills on the tea"}
{"text":"I ordered rolls and ramen online.  Surprisingly, I found the Ramen is made from Instant noodles and it is 7.95! Guys DO NOT order ramen!"}
{"text":"Tokyo Sushi is my favourite place to eat sushi. It seems small and quiet at times but its nice to have a place to unwind. I usually get vegetable gyoza and chicken udon noodle to start which is fresh and delicious. They give complimentary tofu and green tea to start which gets the mouth water works going. Ordering sushi, I normally get green dragon maki, spider roll & rainbow roll with a side of spicy mayo. I have been to many sushi places but I always end up coming back to these guys. Their fish is fresh, the food is great and you never feel gross after eating soo much."}
{"text":"I'm trying to convert my friend to Sushi, and this place helped me succeed.  I was not the biggest fan of this AYCE, but the last trip was really fantastic.  A dizzying selection of sushi and non sushi items, the sashimi was delicious and the rolls were pretty creative for an AYCE.  They had tempura shrimp and veggies as well as many grilled meat skewers, the place was full this evening, and the restaurant was firing on all cylinders, when going to pay, I saw how busy the kitchen was, which was a great sign.  The service is pretty good, the place is ok in terms of decor or service, but they bring you plates with food, we might have ordered some items we never received and not received some items, but that's easily rectified. I always confuse this place with sushi ste-catherine nearby, but not anymore."}
{"text":"Simply awful.  This place has been there for a while.  I went there for lunch and ordered a bento box. Portions were small, the food didn't seem fresh and, relatively speaking, it's not cheap compared to the other restaurants in the area. I guess I should have expected this because there was no one else in the restaurant. The waitress was nice, though."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in North Toronto. Fresh. Delicious. Amazing service. Oh and reasonable prices. Since a picture paints 1000 words I will post for one of our latest trays - we ordered 3 rolls and sashimi: Green Dragon, black dragon, spicy tuna and the small sashimi platters. It was a party for my friend's birthday and they did not disappoint. Oh and they usually throw in a little extra like edamame or noodles.    Quality and the price is right. What more can I say?"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi place in terms of quality/freshness of fish. Order anything except maybe the korean dons (ie sashimi don with hot sauce) and you'll know what i mean by fresh. Rice in dons are sushi quality. Quality of food/service is excellent and consistent for my past 10 visits. For the price its a good alternative to popular spots (eg Japango/Wow)"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and the place was packed. They have the sign that says \"Wait to be seated\", but it should really say \"Patience is a virtue\".  The food is not too bad, but the service is awful."}
{"text":"The waitress there was very polite and that is the only reason why I gave this place 1 star.. The food there was horrible and will never go back there again.. Everything there was sooooo not fresh and the rice they used there for the rolls was soggy.. As for the tempura, it was so oily that oil dripped out when squeezing it with my chop-sticks... Nasty.. Highly NOT-recommend..."}
{"text":"Quiet, decent sushi place near UofT.  Close to UofT and condos around Bay/College-Bloor area. Their Unagi don is one of the best in town, fat and juicy, so does their sashimi don that are mostly fresh and reasonably priced during Lunch hours. Kakimaze don is never on the lunch special list but worth trying if you would like to have a taste of their selection of sashimis. One point to keep in mind is their portion, slightly smaller than average.  Could be a relatively pricy dining option in the neighbourhood if you compare it to the others on Yonge, but definitely reasonably priced speaking of their quality for a sushi place.  As far as I know, the place is Korean operated, yet they have been doing a good job in making decent, authentic Japanese sushi. Not like most sushi place in town owned by Chinese/Korean that had added a list of Korean cuisine in the menu, they specify on Japanese food which is the part I like about them."}
{"text":"By now, you may have figured out that I'm a sushi fanatic (see past reviews).   I'm very happy to find new and tasty sushi restaurants, and Tokyo Sushi is no exception. It is more of a brand name and has a bunch of locations around the city, but the one at Bloor St and Walmer Rd in the Annex is exceptional.    Like any sushi restaurant, you will find your sashimi, your hand rolls, your noodle bowls, and bentos, etc, but I definitely wouldn't pass Tokyo by if I were you.   They have an over-the-top delicious appetizer of fried tofu with this incredible red sauce and green onions (I still, to this day do not know what the sauce is). The maki and sushi are both fresh and well made and the service is always friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Good sushi with decent prices. Comes with free soup, salad, and a bowl of those sweet potatoes noodles! Small seating area though, it's definitely a popular take-out place."}
{"text":"I was in here with my  friend who used to live over 10 years in Tokyo, Japan and we ordered  menu what Chef Jimmy recommend us.   We had dinner 4 types of rolls n sushi  and Tuna Tataki that lightly seared  fresh tuna with warm heated  Sake wine. All of foodies were outstanding!! Salmon was fresh, tempura roll was crispy and rich flavor!  Even my Japanese friend also impressed with these foodies.  If you don't like fish, there is another option for you.  black rice roll with Korean BBQ n avocado, kimchi.   I am absolutely come here again if I miss to eat fresh roll, sushi, no doubt!"}
{"text":"We went here tonight and tried the miso soup, crab salad and a 14pc sushi/16pc roll set. That came with 4 salmon, 4 tuna and 4  of a white fish that I wasn't sure of, as well as 2 shrimp sushi. The rice was very good and the fish was very tasty and tender. It also came with 8pc California roll and 8pc dynamite roll. They served the spicy mayo sauce on the side as our 4.5yo was dining with us.  The only slight negative was that the delicious miso soup did not contain any tofu or seaweed like we usually get elsewhere. Otherwise everything was quickly made and very fresh.  The service was friendly and excellent. The hostess brought child chopsticks for our daughter, gave her a bit more soup when she spilled quite a bit on the table, brought ice water for us and less chilly water for her, and even brought her a special treat for dessert.  Our daughter wanted to give Tokyo Sushi a hundred stars, but we can only give it 5. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"They messed up my order that I had made over the phone. They weren't aware of their lunch specials. I had to explain what they were; was notified that they didn't have any salmon after asking for a special (City Fish is up the street from them. They could've bought salmon from there ). Changed my order to accommodate their lack of salmon. Went in for pickup. Server was disappointed I wasn't tipping for pick-up.  They messed up my order. They messed up real good!  On the plus side, the spicy dynamite roll I was given was good. #stillhungry #jonsnow #kingofthenorth"}
{"text":"Good food, decent price and very friendly service.  We came here for dinner and ordered a monster roll, a sakura roll, two soups and a seaweed salad. We had to push ourselves to finish the meal. The rolls were gigantic!   I espcially loved the monster roll, which had seared salmon belly on top. SO GOOD.   Our server was really great and very gracious about having to run after us outside when I accidentally chipped in a $5 instead of a $20. We will definitely be back, and I will be tipping heavily for my gaffe."}
{"text":"The place is very cozy, it was empty but probably because it was lunch on saturday. The food is very delicious, I asked for a lunch combo that it's like a bento box and it cames with a meat of your choice (chicken or salmon teriaki or meat), rice, salad and you can choose another side dish, I asked for tempura. Everything was fresh and very delicious. This combo was $12, so the price is fair."}
{"text":"Been meaning to add a review for a while.  Just what I needed walking distance to my house. Fairly priced but amazing sushi joint.  Their sashimi is a standout, you can taste the freshness. And their rolls are all crafted with skill and precision. I suggest you try the ocean spicy roll and the spicy sashimi salad. You won't regret it.  This is a great place worth trying! You won't regret it.   Just plain great sushi without the downtown core pretentiousness or prices.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place. It looks like a small and casual place but sushi was out of this world. The sashimi was SO fresh it melted in our mouths. We ordered the sashimi and tempura dinner bento box and the spicy tuna plus golden dragon combo. The helping was large to fill up two large eaters. The bill came to $40 after tax. Service was excellent as well.  Definitely going back and highly recommend this place to any other sushi fans out there!!"}
{"text":"sashimi is very fresh. staff is very attentive but it wasnt very busy the Friday night I was there. you can find good specials on the walls. this place is usually really busy, restaurant is small. great food quality. a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"So disappointed with all the reviews for this place so far! After reading so many raving reviews, I thought we would try this place out as one of my best friends were coming over for lunch. We decided to get take out and do a pick up order of the medium love boat. Placing the order on the phone was quick and easy. Being close to Hina Sushi on the queensway, I would expect tokyo sushi to be competitive with their quality in sushi... to my disappointment it was far from average sushi.  The love boat combo was basically filed with sushi you would not order at any good sushi restaurant. They give you California rolls, and avocado rolls and small amounts of salmon in their maki rolls. for the nigiri they give you the typical salmon, tuna and shrimp... but this time they also gave frozen crab with avocado.... these are all fairly cheap items and i was so UNIMPRESSED... also under each nigiri they put a huge slab of wasabi.. i mean i understand a little bit of wasabi in it to hold the protein down but a slab that is the size of my thumb is unforgiving.. my hubby had one bite and was turned off immediately from the sushi (and he is a huge sushi lover).  The sashimi in the love boat combo were sliced overly thick (to some people it's good), but to me.. i felt their sashimi was not fresh and slimier than usual. Also, with a loveboat combo there should be salad and soup provided.. but nothing was given. Lastly the maki rolls were not rolled tightly enough.. they were loose and by the time we got home (we live like 2 mins away) the rolls were undone. Very unimpressed and will definitely not return. Will be sticking with Hina sushi for sure."}
{"text":"I feel super bad for the server who works here because she's very nice and friendly  but this place is terrrrrible. The inside of the restaurant has private booths as well as some tables , but the walls and wood felt sticky and the water inside their SMALL fish tank was extremely dirty. That's kind of a big indication of how well they take care of their restaurant, imo. The private booths had a removable cushion seating but it was very loose and could easily fall off. The menus were also sticky and I think they're just put in a binder.   Now moving on to the food... jeez.. where do I start? The sushi rice was ABSOLUTELY bland. NO flavour at all. I had the yam tempura roll and the California roll and there was no seasoning whatsoever in these rolls. The tempura was soggy and just plain oily. I was too afraid to try their sashimi or anything with raw fish. If they can mess up something as simple as sushi rice that badly, I don't think I would want to risk trying raw fish at their place. Anyone who has had proper sushi will know right away that this place is just a disgrace to sushi. Sushi rice should never be bland. Ever. I've eaten at so many sushi places and this is by far the worst place I've ever been to. Even the sushi I make at home tastes better than this... honestly I don't even know how this place can get more than 1 star reviews.   The only things I liked about this place was the friendly server, the idea of the private booths and also the little buzzers in the private booths where you can call the server.   I only came here because my sister really wanted sushi and we didn't want to drive too far since I just got off work. We decided to give this place a try but man... it was a total waste of money. Please don't go here. Save your money for a better place. I don't even know how they're still in business, no offence..."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. Friendly helpful staff. Fresh delicious food! An odd point, the soy sauce I believe is a house blend, different but very, very good.  Well priced too!"}
{"text":"Why is this place rated so high? Its very overpriced and very average in taste. I got the seafood udon and there was barely seafood in it...it was just little pieces of frozen seafood floating around.   Definitely better options around."}
{"text":"A couple of friends of mine took me to Tokyo Sushi to celebrate my birthday a couple of weeks ago. (I would have gone there earlier but for confusing the restaurant with Tokyo Grill, just around the corner at Yonge and Wellesley.)  It's unprepossessing, a small storefront restaurant at the base of a condo on a side street connecting Bay with Yonge. Once inside, though, I was quite impressed. The decor was excellent, the quality of the food high, and the service attentive. (On this visit, the waitress was almost too attentive, but I was told by my friends that it`s an anomaly.)"}
{"text":"* good sushi, decent prices * waitresses are really cute, one was pushy * tuna, salmon, salmon belly, masago, sweet shrimp, premium eel, scallop, hot sake  we avoided the toro, the market price was $29.95 for 7 pieces of sushi. had the sweet shrimp - quite good, the premium eel was great, an order of sashmi tuna was fresh, sashimi salmon was fresh, nigri salmon belly was great, fish roe was fresh, masago was fresh, scallop roll was great. just about everything was pretty fresh and delicious. Had two hot sakes, also pretty good."}
{"text":"First time tried this afternoon their lunch special as a take out. Overly impressed by the freshness and flavours of dishes, which included in package miso soup, chicken teriyaki, salad, rice, shrimp and veggie tempura and 6 pcs sushi. Seems like I found the new gem at neighbourhood and definitely will be regular.. Can't wait to try other dishes in their menu."}
{"text":"Je suis un habitué du Sushi St-denis qui appartient au même propriétaire, je pensais trouver un service aussi bien et ben je me suis trompé.  Nous étions dans le coin avec une gang d'amis et on a donc décidé de manger là. On a pu avoir une table pour 7 un lundi soir. Ça c'était correct. Mais ensuite on est allez de déception en déception.  Nous commandons d'abord une première fournée, une fois le tout sur la table on s'aperçoit qu'il nous manque pas mal de chose, on le fait remarquer au chef de salle, sans grand effet.  Deuxième fournée ? Exactement pareil, surtout un ami qui commande de quoi de spécifique avec un certain nombre et il n'a même pas un quart de ce qu'il a commandé, on se plaint de nouveau et il recommande ce qu'il veut, il attend 15 min de plus le temps que ça arrive.  On décide d'arrêter les frais et de payer l'addition. Ben les frais on les a payé et on les a bien senti. On était soi-disant un jour férié \"le jour de Christophe Colomb\" qui n'est pas férié au Quebec (nous avons vérifié et même les québécois avec nous n'en croyaient pas leurs oreilles). Donc on a dut payer pas loin de 4 ou 5 $ de plus.   La raison pour laquelle je ne mets pas qu'une étoile c'est que les sushis étaient bons.  Un conseil si vous y allez avant de prendre une table demandé si dans leur calendrier spécifique ils ne sont pas fériés pour pas avoir la surprise quand la note arrive."}
{"text":"I took my family here after a movie, we used to go to a place by the same name on Bloor, but it closed a couple of years ago. We really loved it, so decided to try this place, hoping it would be as good. We were all really disappointed. The prices were about 30% higher and the service was lacking. Unfortunately, the person (wait staff) serving the tables seemed to also be making our sushi. I have never seen this before. We gave them the benefit of the dought and waited to see what the food was like. It was very different from almost anywhere else I have had Japanese food. The sushi was a strange mix of vegetables cut very large and the rice was not seasoned at all, just sticky and plain. The fish was not fresh and was cut fairly thick. I ordered a bento box the chicken teriyaki was so cloyingly sweet it was not edible, there were a lot of onions and red peppers with it, plain rice took up one of the compartments in the tray (aproxiatly1/2 a cup) and there were the strange veg and salmon (not fresh)sushi in another and in the last compartment was very heavy and undercooked tempura vegetables and shrimp. The wasabi was not fresh and the ginger arrived after we had stopped eating. Overall it was really not good. 4 people (one a vegan) no drinks, it came to over 80.00$, way more expensive that a place we go to downtown. Even my teenaged son didn't finish his food and he loves sushi."}
{"text":"PROS: 1. By far my favorite place for sushi. Every piece of sushi is made beautifully and tastes so fresh, it makes me drool thinking about it. Their cornets are very creative and provide bursts of textures and flavors to die for!!  2. A small, quaint resto with a warm feeling with sushi chefs who interact with customers.  OVERALL: A hidden gem in TO with unbeatable sushi."}
{"text":"I first met this place in a freezing windy day while zapping just-eat. I was craving something warm, good-hearth cooked/re-comforting. With my instant heal recurrence (aka Phó) burnt by 3 uses in one week, I decided to leave the delicated Udon broth work it's magic.  I had 2 places in mind, but I always give a try to new businesses. Tokyo Sushi appeared on my radar and it has tasted like it's going to stay on it!  The first delivery came with extra items: free sample roll + misos and salads (apparently I ate for two).  The second delivery discovered what is going to appear on my \"hang over/cold day\" remedy list: the \"spicy seafood udon\". Man was it spicy? My snot started flowing, I got red, warm, my chest filled with heat - oh my gosh the noodles consistency felted sublime- so meaty! A bit of mussel (while still cold inhaling the heat), more saucy noodles, bite of soft calamari, exhalations, mms!!!, and there you go with the food-gasam.  Ready to repeat!  Oops I did it again! Yesterday's cold weather made me crave something udon, so I just-eat, and finished tasting all the udon options of this place: 100% recommendable."}
{"text":"Very bad service!!they charge you 15%tip even you're only one people,no respect,never go back this shit place again!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my coworkers. The place is Korean owned and we were given banchan as well which is a nice touch.  Initially looking at the menu, I thought everything was overpriced but the after receiving our order, i realized it wasn't overpriced at all. It was actually a good deal.  We ordered 5 different types of rolls (I only remember the soft shell crab and green dragon roll) and I ordered a beef bulgogi bento box. The bento box has so much food, it came with a good portion of tempura (3 shrimps and about 5 vegetable tempura), salad, and 5 sushi on top of the rice with beef. I don't think I even finished half the box before I was stuffed.  Overall I had a good experience. The only negative thing I have to say is our miso soups were forgotten. When we asked our server about it she apologized and brought it out right away."}
{"text":"Great selection of sushi and all you can eat.  You have to order more to get your money's worth bc its ALL YOU CAN EAT but do not over order.  I always get the hot sake bc it helps me eat more and I get a bit tipsy!  I always get the green tea ice cream for dessert and sometimes 2 for me."}
{"text":"I like how they r generous in terms of fish amount and the reasonable price. Some other sushi places are ridiculously expensive but not this one. Quality is good too."}
{"text":"SUPER BAD SERVICE!!! Definitely destroy my appetite. With 'so so' sushi...  It doesn't worth your money!"}
{"text":"My nails salon just down the street and i take advantage of it by coming to this place. The moment i walk in to this sushi bars, i feel like a real japanese. Decoration is good, the food is good. I have to say this place is a good place for dinner."}
{"text":"Tokyo Sushi House is a delicious fusion of Japanese cuisine and signed pictures of Tia Carrere. If you like either, this may be the spot for you, and if you like both, well...let's just say you won't be disappointed.  The multiple signed photos of Tia Carrere will greet you upon your entrance to Tokyo Sushi house. There are other celebrity photos donning the wall, and you are more than welcome to peruse them. X-Men actors Jack Human and Halle Berry both loved Tokyo Sushi House so much they broke their \"no signatures pact\" to pen their names on framed portraits, only for T.S.H.   Fun Fact: Tia Carrere is not the only cast-member of \"Relic Hunter\" to have eaten and loved Tokyo Sushi House. Tucked around the corner of a load-bearing pillar, you'll find co-star Christien Anholt's visage also endorsing T.S.H's cookery.   **If you're a humongous fan of Relic Hunter (and I'm not certain why that would be the case) then you can safely stop the review right here and head on over to the corner of St Joseph and Bay. It's already been vouched for enough for you! What more do you need? A recommendation by Lindy Booth??? (It's perfectly acceptable for non-fans to not understand this reference, there is no need for you to waste precious time on imdb as I did.)**  It took my GF and I quite some time to pick among the many roll options - we settled on a pickled radish maki, the St Joseph roll (Asparagus, cucumber and BBQ Eel) and a spicy scallop roll. The scallops were my favourite. I've noticed lately toronto sushi establishments like to overindulge their spicy rolls in tempura, but not at T.S.H. The rolls were packed to the brim enthusiastically with succulent scallop meat.  We also settled on a Chirashi Don which came with several varieties of Tuna, Salmon, Mackerel, Butterfish, Shrimp, and Squid, on a bed of very flavourful rice. I found the cuts of fish themselves to be abundant, flavourful, and consistently tender.  Pricewise, T.S.H runs higher than the standard Bloor/Yonge joints, but for good reason: the chefs know what they're doing, and I can trust them to deliver a solid serving of soosh. Depending on your tastes, I would advise skipping the sushi combos and getting rolls a la carte. Though, I'm not a Bento Box man and based on other yelpers' pics, those look pretty dynamite too."}
{"text":"Very good food, big portions, clean environment and reasonable prices. Definitely to go sushi place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This joint is pretty tiny, so it wouldn't be ideal for groups larger than 6. I am a bit perplexed by the 4 star rating; perhaps the raw stuff is better than their cooked meals? Anyhow:   I came here in a party of 7, without reservations, and they were able to seat us right away. Service was friendly, and they came by to refill our tea every once in a while as needed (but I find it strange that they only ever filled our cups 3/4 of the way...). They were able to split the bill for us without a fuss.   I had Bento Box E ($15; seaweed salad, chicken teriyaki, 6 california rolls, rice, croquette, white rice). While I understand that this price is pretty average for sushi joints closer to the downtown core, I felt that it wasn't worth it. A) chicken teriyaki (breast, not dark meat) was dry, and the portion wasn't that generous B) why only one croquette???? C) I didn't get the promised green salad that accompanies all entrees  I probably won't come back. There are tastier and more affordable places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Really great place for sushi! My wife and I were so full after that meal it was hard getting up to go home! Quality of food was great too, portion size was very generous for the price. Definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"I think this place has the best sushi around the area. Fish is really fresh. The service is good ! The place is fairly small but always quite busy. Highly recommend their donburi!"}
{"text":"It may not be the cheapest sushi joint but I found I was paying just a little extra for some of the finest sushi I have ever tasted. That, and the chef and waitstaff were superfriendly and efficient.. Definitely worth a look."}
{"text":"Before I start with the review I'd like to get this off my chest, Tokyo sushi has a free soft drink deal when you check in on yelp but when I showed it to the waitress she said no way. It's not a big deal but little annoying. Anyways, back to the review, Tokyo sushi is a good place to eat decent Japanese style dishes and sushi. The price for a Bento box is just about $10 and the food is good, not the best Japanese I ate but the tempura dishes were lightly battered and delicious. The service was average at best and the was surprising considering the Japanese are known for good service.  Bottom line, if you're in the area and don't want pizza or pasta then this is good but if you want a great Japanese restaurant this may not be for you."}
{"text":"A pretty decent spot!  I went for lunch and was surprised to find it to be relatively busy.  The service was extremely quick, and the food came even quicker.  I ordered a chirashi don and a spicy salmon roll (to get a gauge on fish quality and overall sushi quality).  The chirashi was okay, the quality wasn't completely up to my expectations.  The salmon was good, but not fatty enough (in my opinion at least).  Another suprise was that there was no butterfish - instead a extra helping of yellow tail sashimi was provided.  Butterfish being my current favourite fish, I was slightly dissappointed in that decision, but an accepted one nonetheless.  The spicy salmon roll... wasn't that great.  Once again this is a matter of taste, but i felt that the rice seasoning was a bit off.  Perhaps the vinegar to sugar ratio was not to my normal expectancy?  But I generally did not like the SSR.  My experience there was nice, however.  They portrayed Japanese customs quite nicely, and their tea was exquisite."}
{"text":"Dirigé par les mêmes propriétaires que Sushi crescent et Sushi st-denis, je dirais que cette succursale est celle que j'aime le moins. Service presqu'inexistant (ce qui est problématique dans un all you can eat!), le poisson ne goute pas frais et les employés ne pourraient pas être plus bêtes. Tant qu'à avoir envie de sushi à volonté, marchez un 5 minutes plus loin et allez vous remplir l'estomac au Sushi crescent. Je sais que ce sont les mêmes propriétaires, mais je n'ai jamais eu de problèmes à cet autre succursale."}
{"text":"One of my favourite go-to's for sushi. Great value, huge portions and high quality. We went for lunch and got 2 bento boxes with the beef bulgogi, one with the 12pc sashimi, the other with the shrimp and veg tempura. The bento box came with a big portion of beef, rice, salad, soup and 2 pcs of shrimp and 4 veg tempura - all for $13!! The second came with the same and 12 big pieces of fresh sashimi for only $16! Definitely more food than other bento boxes at other places. We also go the Orangeville roll with 8 pieces. The pieces were giant and the spicy scallop inside was really tasty. I highly recommend this place for a filling sushi lunch for a great price. The owners are super friendly and always provide wonderful service. Oh yes, also they give 3 plates of banchan with your meal - yummy pieces of Korean pancake, japchae and soya bean sprouts. Delish!"}
{"text":"Good food, but they gave me the wrong order. I wanted the appetizer and they charged me double for the meal. Not happy."}
{"text":"Toronto has a lot of sushi bars, some of which can be a HIT or MISS.  TOKYO Sushi House (TSH) made the cut thankfully. Away from the busy Yonge Street, at Bay st and St Joseph across from St Mikes college at UofT, TSH is small, cute, quiet, clean and well priced! The service is friendly and efficient.  Keep in mind they have an extensive menu from combos, to bento boxes, and shareables available.  Our group of four ended up ordering Bento boxes ($12-17) and some sides; spicy salmin sushi, tuna, gyoza, and edamame (avg $3.50-8/ 6pcs)  The sushi and ingredients were fresh, affordable and presentation was perfect. I'm glad this was the place of choice..... :-) Just be sure to make reservations as this venue is small, and street parking is available closeby."}
{"text":"Should have expected less, but they didn't really have good sushi..  They had photos of sushi in their menu and when I would point to it, they would say they didn't carry it.  they pretty much use stock photos for their food, which I do not like. Why have a picture of something on your menu, if your restaurant does not carry it?  They also don't take card and their atm was broken- so my friend had to walk down the street to get cash.   We also kept having to ask for refills on our water. Might as well been self serve."}
{"text":"Bad service and bad sushi. Never going back. Also the wasabi is really strong so go easy on it and the vegetarian tempura roll was really weird tasting. It wasn't crunchy at all. It was mushy and bland."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been here a handful of times and have never been disappointed. The portions are generous, the arrangements are beautiful and the service is great. Also dig the tunes!"}
{"text":"It's a bit hard to find as its in the bottom floor of a condo building and I wasn't thinking that's where it was located. I'm very pleased with this place. The staff were very helpful and nice. The restaurant is clean and comfortable and quiet. The food was delicious and well priced (try the Chirashi or any of their lunch specials) and I liked their green tea. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Foods, including Miso soup, tempura and noodles are okay but the owner apparently had more important business to take care of that day. Ear sticked to the phone all the time, even when serving dishes."}
{"text":"Tokyo Sushi is literally what you would define as a hole in the wall. I live across the street from it and it took me 2 weeks to notice it was even there! Craving some good sushi, I decided to check it out and when I went in I was shocked to see how amazingly small it was and how there were 4 people working in such a tight spot. After I poked my head in a bit more I saw the back opens up a bit to about 3 or so tables.  Regardless of the size of the place the sushi is really good - a litttllee bit more expensive than you'd usually find but definitely worth it. The people who work there are really nice and everyone greets you when you walk in. Service is BLAZING fast. When I order something, 3 sushi chefs get to work and I have my takeout in less than 2 minutes.  The walls are filled with personalized autographed pictures of celebrities thanking Tokyo Sushi and I know this is one of those places that a celebrity comes into, closes the whole place down and takes the restaurant all for themselves!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't bother - the price you pay for the quantity/quality of the sushi combo at dinner I can guarantee you get much fresher and less common fish if you go north a street to Charles at Wow Sushi or south a couple streets to Solo Sushi."}
{"text":"Wow - a five star sushi review coming from me in Toronto is rare, so let's just say I'm in a good mood and this was for take-out, which ended up exceeding all my expectations on a busy night at work. Anyone who has had a sushi conversation with me knows that I am a sushi snob, having lived in Vancouver and hate having to pay loads of money for mediocre sushi.. but we are in Toronto, and I know there are great places out there.  Tucked away in a little street beside a big Green Grotto (that also intrigued me), I read everyone's yelp reviews to help me find this place (thanks yelpers!) When I look for a good place to get Sushi - I always read about the quality of Sashimi, rice to roll ratio, and value. The photos on yelp absolutely help so I know what to expect. While I know Chirashi has a variety of fish, at least I can gage the size, quantity, etc....  So, I called, checked to see what type of fish would come with my Chirashi, and also ordered a scallop handroll as well (I'm pretty to scallop at the moment). I arrive to pick up my order, and was to find this place was pretty busy. The doorway is small and you can easily miss it. Excited to have my meal, I opened my take out box to a beautiful compilation of fresh fish - 20 pieces to be exact for $14.95 - no joke. It was fresh, cut nicely, and each piece had substance. The variety had everything from salmon, different cuts and types of tuna, egg, mackerel, snapper, shrimp, roe, etc.. I was thoroughly impressed.  The scallop roll - just skip it... way too much rice, and scallops too small....  So the 5 stars is strictly for the Chirashi. I hope the quality keeps up because I will be back!"}
{"text":"A neat place and a hidden gem on St Joseph street....Chirashi Don was superb! the staff was nice and came to refill the tea all the time. My friends got Bara Chirashi Don which looked pretty good too."}
{"text":"This place is definitely overrated. They are way more expensive than other sushi restaurants I've been to. The dishes my friend and I ordered were pretty generic so we were expecting the food to be top notch but meh, they tasted regular, nothing special."}
{"text":"I've seen this restaurant located there for many years, so I figured if it lasted this long, the sushi must be at least decent.  It was overpriced for what I got.  Ordered a sushi lunch special, the sushi was loaded with rice with a tiny piece of fish on top.  The rice fell apart when I picked it up with the chopstick.  I could of just ate at Dragon Legend for the same price and get more selection and better quality food."}
{"text":"This place was really amazing! I went here for the first time today with friends (four ppl) and we decided to get a tempura appetizer, Gyoza dumpling appetizer and a $63.00 party tray that's suppose to feed 6 people I believe.  Everything was really amazing! The assortment of sushi and sashimi was great and the ingredients were top notch. After splitting the bill with tax and 15% tip (that I chose to add) it was $25.01."}
{"text":"For take-out sushi, this place is one of the best I've come across. I've ordered from them a few times and haven't been disappointed.  Delivery is very fast considering the distance from my home (e.g., ordered at 7:15-7:20 and food arrived by 7:50, 15 minutes sooner than the estimate they provided) and each time they have thrown in a bunch of extras - panchan (sprouts, kimchee, etc.), pajun, edamame, chap chae). Note that this is clearly a Korean-Japanese restaurant...  The tempura always arrives crispy, thanks to the clever trick they have of notching the corner our of the styrofoam container to allow the steam to vent to keep it from becoming soggy.  I've been happy with all of the rolls I've ordered, as well as the bulgogi and fried tofu teriyaki. My husband has ordered spicy noodle soup that he has asked them to customize for him to be a more authentic version of his favourite soup from Korea.  Will definitely order from them again the next time the mood for take-out sushi strikes."}
{"text":"Three of us for dinner - ordered the sushi combo for two and a bento box.  Sushi came on a bamboo boat with a good variety.  Plenty of food for three.  Pretty good sushi and sashimi - not great but good, and good value."}
{"text":"This place is a good go-to when Mazz sushi is too packed.  The sushi quality is very good and quite fresh.  Never any complaints with the food not tasting fresh here.  Salad dressing and miso soup are both SO good.  My BF usually doesn't like miso soup but he likes the one they serve here.  The Chef is also very nice and makes substitutions for us when we request.  For dinner, I usualy get the M2 which is 6 pieces of caifornia roll and 8 pieces of dynamite roll (with a soup an d salad) for $9.95.  An order of yam tempura ($3.95) is a nice appetizer to share before your meal.  Always served piping hot, and not too greasy at all.  The perfect ratio of yam to batter.  Aren't many Sushi places in the area so it's nice to have an alternative to Mazz.  The prices are about the same as Mazz too.  Service is always friendly and the place is clean enough."}
{"text":"We just went to Tokyo Sushi close to Yonge/Wellesley for sushi and paid like $15 for a roll (6 piece) lunch special. Food quality & portion is not worth $15. I have had much better, more fresher and cheaper at other places around such as Sushi Box close by. The sushi, fish & rice quality is just so so/mediocre. Sushi Box and the sushi place close to my work is a lot better & cheaper too. I paid almost $20 for a 6 piece roll with tax & tips. My friend ordered the chicken teriyaki and didn't like it much too. The chicken was pre-cooked/boiled and they just slap the sauce on so it was not fresh. Rice was dry too. Would not come back & don't recommend this place to anyone else.  Try the Sushi place inside Women's College Hospital also. It is cheaper, very fresh & much better. This place is not Japanese owned like what other reviewers said, it is Korean owned & not that authentic."}
{"text":"I'm lost now that it is closed for renovations. Hopefully it re-opens soon. Has been my go-to sushi place in my neighbourhood since I moved here. Spicy Salmon roll and two orders of Unagi sushi every time! Quality is much better than the other places in the area and service is always friendly. They will usually throw in a couple of extra pieces when I dine in. My kids love eating here too."}
{"text":"I used to go to the Bloor street location and decided to try the St Clair location since I was in the area.  I went in right at 11 when they opened and they were on their game.  I had a menu in my hands right away and was eating a few minutes after ordering.  The miso was really good, not too salty and the perfect temperature.  The rolls were a good size, I can usually eat a lot but I was more than satisfied after having the bento box lunch.  The tempura was soooo good, perfectly battered and you could still taste the vegetables accurately.  Price is good considering what you get, definitely would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Amazing blew my mind!!!  I am a sushi and sashimi lover.  Totally worth the trip!!!  Closing time 11pm ish visit and absolutely fresh and melts on your tongue!!! The staff is amazing and friendly- warm ppl- rare in Toronto- feels like family:)"}
{"text":"I've been hoping to find a great sushi place - for both dine in and take out - in our new neighbourhood since we moved here in February. My husband and I just came back from dinner at Tokyo Sushi and I'm happy to have found our new go-to place!  Clean, comfortable and traditional decor inside, it even features proper real chopsticks (set out for you in a nice box), not disposable wooden ones, and a cool little wireless bell attached to each table to call the wait staff. This Tokyo Sushi appears to be run by a family - all the staff were very attentive and friendly. The sushi chef even delivered our rolls/sushi right to our table.   The food itself was truly delicious and fresh. Even the miso soup was perfect. The green salad (and I'm a big \"green salad\" fan) was amazing - I wanted to drink the dressing off the plate :/ The rolls and sushi were so good - the rice and seaweed was good quality and fresh.  Overall this place deserves 5 stars - it's reasonably priced (not the cheapest, but given the quality it is very well priced), delicious and fresh, attentive & friendly service and a great atmosphere.   They don't have a website so I snapped some pics of their takeout menu - I will try and post these up."}
{"text":"Fine, they get 2.5 stars. But not 3 because .... that's too much.   A total of 4.5 stars in general is not accurate. No. Maybe in Toronto? But .. no.   I had a couple maki rolls ... spicy salmon or tuna or chopped scallop or something. I could barely taste it. I seem to notice a trend in Toronto sushi: the rice is SUPER sparse, almost non-existent. What gives?? Is rice expensive or something. 'Cuz I buy a big sack of Nishi rice at the Korean supermarket for like 5.99 and it lasts forever. And the fish is also non-existent. I understand that quantity does not equal quality but .. throw me a bone here.   Pro: I had a wakame salad and it was good.   Another con: this is not cheap either. Can't remember exactly but it's about ... $4.95 or something for one aforementioned roll.   I really need to stop eating sushi in Toronto. I need to accept that in most cases, it's going to be a miss."}
{"text":"Tokyo Sushi est très bien pour manger autant de sushis que vous le voulez pour pas cher (environs 20$ avec taxes et service). Nous étions assez nombreux (7) donc le pourboire était déjà inclut dans le montant final et on aime ça!   Il y a un grand choix de sushis, makis, viande teriyaki, ramen, rouleaux de printemps, etc.   Nous avions pris plusieurs sortes de makis et ce que je leur reproche c'est que, tout d' abord, ils étaient vraiment gros, comparé à ceux que j'ai déjà mangé et ça fait lourd sur l'estomac! De plus, je trouve qu'ils avaient tous plus ou moins le même goût, je ne pouvais même pas les différencier! Je trouve dommage de ne pas goûter un minimum de saveur! Pas assez raffiné selon moi!   Dans le prix est inclu le dessert, vous avez un choix de 3 glaces: thé vert, mangue et haricots rouges! Moi j'ai pris mangue et certains de mes amis haricots rouges, j ai goûté, je m'attendais à un goût spécial mais en fait, non, c'était très ressemblant à la mienne! Bref, ça fait toujours un petit dessert et  vu le prix on ne peut pas être trop exigeant non plus...  Enfin, l'endroit est assez moderne et le personnel est sympathique, souriant, serviable et rapide!   Tokyo Sushi n'est, selon moi, pas la meilleure place pour manger des sushis mais c'est une bonne formule: manger des sushis à volonté jusqu'à ce que vous n'en pouvez plus, pour pas cher! Je peux vous dire qu'après être passé par là vous ne mangez plus de la journée!"}
{"text":"I get the veggie rolls and they're really good. My husband got the beef teriyaki roll, it was not very good, not what you would expect, it is almost like ground beef in rice, not good. But the veg rolls are great."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place because they had student coupons for their \"all you can eat\" lunches. They would occasionally bring you things you didn't order, or forget to include some things that you did order, but the staff were always nice and the sushi always kept coming.  Food:  8/10 Service:  7/10 Price:  8/10 Atmosphere:  8/10"}
{"text":"The sushi is delicious and the rolls are pretty good. I like ordering sashimi platters. The only problem is the parking around here. Cause its on st. Clair but i would come here again. 4/5"}
{"text":"This place WAS better. It is under new management now and is just okay. The prices went up and the service went down. The food was ok. The price point did not match though. I may try it again later to see if the new owners get their sea legs but my initial experience was very...meh."}
{"text":"As this restaurant has been around for quite some time, I'm not sure why I've only started to eat here. It is rather unassuming from the outside, sitting at the base of a condo building.  What I'm really impressed with are the lunch specials. $10.95 for chirashi don is a fantastc deal - large bowl of rice, topped with a variety of well-sized sashimi. This is by far the cheapest price I've seen for chirashi; comes with miso and salad as well. Understandably, dinner prices are higher."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery at 5PM arrived at 6:30PM, obviously the food was cold and when I stated it was really late, the delivery man simply replied \"yea, okay.\"  As for the food, it was even more horrendous, I ordered Yakidori, beef teriyaki dinner, soft shell crabs x2 and Yaki (yucky) udon.  The Yakidori was bland in flavour, was slabbed with teriyaki sauce, no signs of grilling, the soft shell crabs were soggy and it had no dipping sauce.  As for the beef teriyaki, it had nearly no beef, only a few slices here and there and the Yaki udon, was just sloppy and barely any seafood, chicken or vegetables.  Horrible food, horrible service.  Do not eat here."}
{"text":"Yup, yelpers are right, this hidden cozy place is good. Fast service, generous potions of fish for the Suishi. Big menu but lots of activity so you don't question the freshness. Located on the south east corner of Bay and St Joseph."}
{"text":"If you are really hungry, this is the spot. I mean you have to be so hungry to not worry about quality of food style hungry. If you want quality this is not a place I can recommend. I will say that the beef tataki is really good though. Other than that all dishes are very average and tend to be fatty.  Service is good and water is filled at all times."}
{"text":"I love their Tokyo Chirashi don!  I usually don't like chirashi don because it's usually taste so plain. But their one is different! Have to try it If you go their. Their staffs are beyond friendly, I feel like home there"}
{"text":"Don't really understand the raving reviews about this place as it really isn't anything special. I even tried it twice just because I couldn't believe how bad it was the first time. Regardless, the sashimi served here just isn't up to my standards."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times recently & it's been fine every time. From all the places in the area that I've tried this place is the best. They give out little free appetizers when you order. Compared to the places in the area this place would be 5 stars. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to come here but if you're in the area & looking for fresh sushi this is really your only option."}
{"text":"Very good service. I just wish the food was abit more special. The roll combo and my beef bowl wasnt really worth the value."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  So close to five stars! Lemme explain.  I was volunteering nearby two nights ago, and brought up Yelp search to see any nearby affordable minimum 4-star restaurants. This came up, and the photos shown looked very scrumptious so I decided to give it a shot.  Arrived at around 9:30pm, and the place was about half full. Not bad for late night. I was promptly seated and treated immediately by a waitress who gave me green tea (which by the way tasted very good, as it has that pinch of rice and sweetness flavour). I ordered the Tokyo Sushi Set, and I found the meal to be beautifully crafted with extremely fresh fish that's between thin and thick. It was simply delicious, and definitely I rate it among one of the best sushi restaurants in the downtown core.  Now why did it lose one star?  The set doesn't come with miso soup or salad! For $15.99 I sorta expected at least a soup or salad to start up, as is typical with all the other Japanese restaurants. However this one came with nothing. Just the sushi. I looked at the menu after and I didn't see any mentions of soup or salad to come with the sushi sets (didn't take a look at the lunch specials or the other combos).  Lack of starter aside, I highly recommend this place for high quality sushi at affordable prices. I have a few other places I want to try before giving a final consensus to where I'll be having my Tuesday dinners from now on, as I'll be volunteering down by Wellesley for the next 6-7 months."}
{"text":"I went to Tokyo sushi. I had a lot of different kinds of food. The restaurant was very dark and it was difficult to see the waitress. The service was very good. I recommend Tokyo sushi even though   it was expensive."}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch visit here with my uncle. We each ordered a tempura/sushi bento box, and were definitely satiated by the end of it. It came with a delicious tofu dish and miso soup as appetizers. The box then came out with salad, rice, vegetable tempura, sashimi, sushi and maki rolls. Although the maki rolls were kind of sloppy, overall the box was decent, and decently priced as well.  Service was decent, but annoying at times. Our waitress would come over and loudly ask if we needed anything else, when it was clear that we did (i.e. our empty tea cups were placed at the edge of the table).  Final evaluation: DECENT... Since I overused that word throughout this review."}
{"text":"* Review is based on my take out experience and food only *  We planned a Japanese Lunch Party at work on Friday. In order to avoid confusion/mix-ups with the 'who ordered what' and 'you pay $5.83 and I pay 8.25,' we decided to order platters. I gave Tokyo Sushi the number of people, what we wanted, and a price - TS made it happen. I asked for everything to be ready by noon and it was. The food wasn't out of this world, but it also wasn't narsty.  Very accommodating place, I would definitely recommend this place if you want to order for a group."}
{"text":"Takeout/Pickup: Friendly service. Great food. Presented very well even for takeout, they didn't try squeeze rolls in everywhere they could. Very reasonably priced. One con would be there is no delivery service. I can't wait to sit down and have a meal there sometime in the near future."}
{"text":"Great all you can eat restaurant. Much better than Kanda and Odaki. You can get all you can eat sushi lunch for about 17 with tax and tip. The sushi is great, but for those who aren't big sushi fans this restaurant also has tons of other menu options such as several great chicken and steak options and some great soups and rice dishes. Everyone should definitely get the dragon eye roll! It is deep fried and comes with a spicy mayo sauce on top. Delicious! Another one of my favorites is the salmon sushi. The quality of salmon is very good and I can eat about 8 of them on my own.   This is a great place to go to with friends--especially if you are very hungry. However, you need to make sure you give yourself enough time since the service is a bit slow.   I have been to this restaurant at least 15-20 times and every time I go into the city I always go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and conveniently located. At least to my house :-)  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"One visit for takeout and I'm hooked. This rating may change in future. Still, awesome.  They're having their grand reopening this week. Diners who dine in get 50% off everything. I wanted takeout, but hey, I got good tips this week and I can splurge.   They have Korean and Japanese food. Both menus are fairly extensive. In my experience restaurants who try to do both are jacks of all trades and masters of none, but fortunately that doesn't seem to be the case here.   The prices seem high. The least expensive sashimi or sushi combo for one is around $13. If you're really hungry, for $24 you can get an adorable wooden boat full of sushi brought to your table. I didn't want salad and soup, so I didn't care about a combo, and I ordered two of their big special rolls: a Rainbow Roll and a Las Vegas Roll.   While I waited they gave me some tea, and I sat and watched the sushi chefs. Considering how crowded the place was, I still got my food before my tea had cooled off. The menu didn't mention it but my rolls came with a cup of soup and other goodies, which I assumed would be the ubiquitous iceberg-lettuce-and-carrot-dressing, but turned out to be edamame, kimchi, chapchae noodles, and little strips of fried pancake. Now there's the Korean influence. :)   The atmosphere is nice, dark and colourful and a bit cramped with sugary pop music playing. The patio seating area is not much smaller than the inside seating area. You can get in without a step up but I wouldn't call it accessible just because of the narrowness of the space between tables, and the washrooms are in the basement too.   The food turned out to be fantastic. Huge rolls stuffed with stuff, topped with piles of tobiko. I was a bit overfull after the two rolls and snackies. Perfect. It's a $20 meal but well worth it, and I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great service and good sushi. Nothing mind blowing, but we will definitely go back again. Better than others close by, for sure."}
{"text":"It was Saturday past 6pm.  Kids just finished at Angus Glen arena and was starving. We decided on Japanese. We didnt want to spend too much since kids usually want quantity, not quality for food.  We passed on some of the AYCE sushi places nearby.  Wife remembered seeing this place. I ran into look at the menu, and we looked at the yelp reviews, but kids were starving!!! So ..in we go.  Even though it had terrible reviews.  I can now say that all the reviews are pretty spot on.  Bathrooms were...dirty, no paper towels, needed a good cleaning!  The whole place needs a reno!  All of the food was tasteless and bland.  Even the kids noticed the food quality was bad. We were there for about an hour, the place was dead and no one else came in.  This is a Saturday night!! Prime time.  The lady server was nice and friendly, but i do not see myself going back. Seriously the sushi from t&t or sunnys is much better!  3stars for service 0 stars for food"}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm not a sushi aficionado but I can say confidently that the fish here is good and tasty. All of the employees seem really happy and are all friendly, and the sushi chefs are awesome.  In an area that is rife with good food options, I still end up here at least 1x/week."}
{"text":"AVOID! I got duped with the chicken teriyaki that came with miso and salad. Added shrimp tempura.  Salad was drizzled with KETCHUP! KETCHUP! Miso soup did NOT have tofu in it! Barely any seaweed.   Teryaki was loaded with sugary sauce with next to NO chicken!   The shrimp tempura was just deep fried with white flour batter.  Paid 30$ with tax nd tip.  AVOID THIS PLACE IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO EXPERIENCE PROPER JAPANESE CUISINE!   I AM JUST THANKFUL FOR AVOIDING THE SUSHI AT THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Honestly some of the best sushi you can find in Toronto that's not tucked away in the small menu of a fancy joint.  I live really close to the place and don't think I would've found out about it or tried it otherwise. It's just not in a very prominent location, and as a result, is never really busy. So of course I was really surprised by the quality of the fish. The menu's pretty extensive, with some dishes you don't normally find at most uninspired \"teriyaki bento\" sushi places in Toronto. There are some specials on the walls that change once in a while, and there are some dishes whose fish combinations are \"chef's choice\".  It's definitely more expensive than your usual sushi place, but the quality meets the price. The fish is always fresh, and dishes like the chirashi don has a good fish to rice ratio. Even their non-sushi dishes are pretty good, like their udon soups.  It's a small place but cozy. And again, with it's hidden location I've never had to worry about not being seated. If you're ordering take-out there are some magazines and books in English and Japanese to keep you entertained. (Or if you're like me you can eavesdrop on the waitress and sushi chefs bantering in Japanese...!)  I'd come more often given its convenience, but the price of high-quality sushi in Toronto forces me to make it more of a luxury!"}
{"text":"Found my new go to Resturant to order in from!!  Their rolls are full of fresh ingredients and the ratio from rice to filling is on point. I would not categorize this place as an upscale sushi Resturant but it's affordable and great! I think they make most of their money from take out because it is never ever busy inside. The owners are super friendly and once they get to know you they'll start throwing in extra rolls. My friends and I got the sashimi sushi platter and it was so much food. The spicy salmon crunch and yam tempura stood out for me. Super impressed!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place because the rolls LOOK so tasty...  But they don't taste that good. The spicy salmon  in Their rolls are awful... Fried, no taste NO spice.  Also they put way to much avocado in the rolls which make them all taste the same. I didn't like the crab they used, extremely artificial. The sushi pizza was good... So was the shrimp tempura roll. Service sucked. I love sushi and this place has turned me off sushi for a while. I will not return."}
{"text":"20 dollars for a all you can eat sushi restaurant, I wasn't used to it and I have to admit I was a bit scared.  BUT  Ok the sushis/nigiri/sushi pizza (whaaaat?) were ok, not amazing but good, and for this price it was definitely worth it.  Fast service, tips included in the final bill, not a great atmosphere (but not really a problem) I don't think you can expect much from this kind of place, but it certainly does the job."}
{"text":"If you love sushi, this is the best place in Toronto for it.  I have had sushi in Tokyo, Japan at the Shinuko (?) fish port and the sushi here is as awesome here as it was there.  The prices are a bit high, but you are getting a very quality product."}
{"text":"Tokyo Suishi is a nicely decorated restaurant. It has been closed for a long time, but recently reopened. It is a family run restaurant.  I ordered the yakitori chicken and the salmon dinner. I thought that the restaurant was an average Japanese restaurant. The yakitori chicken was very good, but too much sauce. The salmon came on a sizzling hot plate which was unexpected. It was very good.  Would I go back? The food was good, but rather expensive."}
{"text":"This place is consistent.  The quality of the tea is exceptional - good quality green tea is a must with sashimi.  Even though I don't go to a sushi-ya for the salad, being served a salad which is fresh (as they do here) is a positive sign that they take freshness seriously.  Had the sashimi there today and it was served at a perfect temperature which enhances the flavour of the fish.  Sashimi was well-cut and of generous proportions.  They have a reduced salt soya sauce as well as regular soya sauce on the table which is a nice touch.  Spouse had the seafood udon which was good, noodles were not overcooked and it was nicely presented.  The service is attentive and efficient.  Definitely a place I would not hesitate returning to, time and again."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting sushi...and even worse service.   I went here for the first time with my boyfriend today and never have I ever at any restaurant in my whole life have I felt this disrespected. I even made an account on Yelp just for the purpose of this review!   We walk in, order sushi, wait.. the usual. We ordered 20 snapper nigiri, 2 shrimp nigiri and 4 eel nigiri off the bat. When we got our food, my boyfriend and I was instantly STUNNED by the huge amount of rice per nigiri compared to the tiny thin slice of fish on top. I'm a huge sushi fan, and I've been to my far share of sushi restaurants...and this is the worst quality I have EVER seen. I believe that if you take the rice off of just 4 nigiri there, you would have a hefty bowl of rice. This is not an exaggeration. I've been to many AYCE, and sure, the quality is not always the best, but it was never to the point where rice was so much that we couldn't even eat it. So we removed half the rice, which by the way was hard and falling apart everywhere, and put it on a napkin. We had to do this with every nigiri for the sushi to be at least eatable. It was ridiculous how much rice they put! And they expect us to eat it all...  I know that a lot of AYCE places like to make the sushi with an indecent amount of rice to make you more full, causing you to pay for the leftover pieces, but this place was like another level. I am not one to waste food, ever, and I always eat the entire thing, but at this place, I felt like I was choking on a mouthful of disgusting rice dipped in soy-sauce. Absolutely torture.   We ask for the bill at the end, and the girl waiter comes up to us and asks if I put rice on my napkin, I said \"yes I did\", and she goes \"we are going to charge you 0.99$ for each sushi rice wasted.\" Feeling completely wronged, we immediately try and defend the reasons why we HAD to do this. We explained to her that the sushi was uneatable because there was an overwhelming amount of rice, with a very very thin piece of fish.    It was unfortunate that I couldn't show her since we finished all the pieces. But we tried to explain. She wouldn't take it and kept on saying how \"other customers all finish it without wasting rice\" etc. At this point, this conversation was starting to cause a scene, as other customers were starring and she was practically yelling at us. I told her that we wouldn't be able to eat all 26 pieces without removing part of the rice. And she kept giving the same excuses, how other people can eat the rice so I guess everyone should be able to. We then asked how much she is going to charge, and she keeps saying \"well that depends on how many pieces you wasted.\" I was starting to get frustrated at this point because we took out the rice on all of them, so was she saying she's going to charge us 26$ because of MERE rice? She kept on saying that she needs to charge a dollar per piece of rice wasted, and wouldn't listen to our explanation. We tried to calm the situation down and just agreed to pay the amount she wanted for the waste, which she declared 5$. Why then did she need to keep telling us she had to charge 1$ per piece? I really do not understand the logic of this woman.   Of course, the entire mood of this meal was just ruined after this; we couldn't even enjoy our remaining food and just wanted to get the hell out of this place. Never have I felt so ignored and disrespected as a paying customer. Oh, and there was also fish seeds in the ice-cream. Needless to say, we gave no tip. And this restaurant just lost another 2 customers for good. They seriously need to focus on better quality and service instead of desperately trying to rob people of a few dollars. This place is a total scam. Do no recommend!"}
{"text":"Horrible place ever!!  The fish cut was small & thin....wasn't fresh at all!  Part of the order was chirashi...lettuce used as garnish.  Washrooms were filthy!!  Urgh!! Pretty run down place!!  Never going back there again!!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem indeed! We ordered the sushi sashimi combo and a spicy udon, fish was fresh and udon was super flavorful... and talk about the service, we were all super impressed with the service, my sister especially. will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to get Spicy salmon don in Toronto! Amazing service and food quality all times."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the city. Seriously. Service is warm; good atmosphere."}
{"text":"My friend wanted chicken teriyaki and rice. Nothing else. Sounds simple enough. Right? Not at this restaurant. We spoke to several staff before they were willing to accommodate her. They finally gave in and served her rice with chicken teriyaki for $10.95. Plain ol' rice with chicken that looked and tasted boiled. Yuck.  I ordered a bento box for lunch for $17! Yes, $17 for a bento box! Insane!! I went with it because of all the positive reviews and because I figured it would have to be pretty amazing. It wasn't! It was such a waste of money! There was nothing in that bento box that should have made it worth more than $10. Oddly enough, it came with a fried potato with corn--much like a hash brown. It was all wrong! I rather they had stuck to what most places offer in their bento boxes; tempura vegetables! The one plus was that it came with a seaweed salad which is unusual in bento boxes. All in all it was such a waste of money!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across the very unassuming Tokyo Sushi late one night when an exercise-induced hunger rendered me desperate for a satisfying, but not too filling snack. Although the two California roll deal proved to be just a bit too much food for this occasion, it was too good of a deal to pass up. For $8, the 12 pieces of maki were sided with miso soup, green salad, and chap chae complete with black fungus.   Service from the Japanese server was friendly and prompt. We were even served tea while waiting for the food to be prepared. I took a take out menu with me so that I can call ahead to take advantage of the 13% discount for picking up and paying with cash next time."}
{"text":"I have been going to this hidden little sushi shop since I was a child and it is still the best place that I have visited! The space is small but kept clean and it's a very calming atmosphere to enjoy your meal.  The sushi itself is delicious and always very fresh, the rice is seasoned and cooked not too soft but just right. The fish has a clean taste to it and melts in your mouth. My favourite thing to order is the grilled salmon sashimi. The rolls are so light and don't feel like there's too much sauce like some lower quality sushi places, this place leaves you feeling clean and fresh. I've had their udon noodles before and they are equally good the broth is flavourful and the noodles are aldente. Honestly you can't go wrong with anything from here.  The service here is what gives this place five stars the waiters are always nice and attentive and the chefs smile as you come and go and they remember you even if you haven't visited for a long time! The complimentary tea is delicious and is a amazing rice tea. I highly recommend anyone to visit here as you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I come here on a weekly basis even after moving away from the lovely st. Joseph st. They the most adorable staff and delicious rolls. I've tried other dishes like the yakisoba, curry, takoyaki, and were not impressed, however, their rolls are a whole other level. The food is consistent, authentic and always fresh, price is fair and the restaurant is cozy, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 2009. My go to dish here is the chirashi deluxe. One of the best bang for your buck chiraishi bowls I'd say anywhere in Toronto. Includes more than 20 pieces of fish, including salmon, snapper yellow tail, butter fish and also premium pieces such as scallop, uni, ikura, medium toro, raw sweet shrimp with heads fried off to crispy perfection, all for 23 dollars? YES please! Will you get stuffed? No. but the variety and presentation is worth the 20 bucks. You would get half as much or less variety in similar establishments such as japango."}
{"text":"Normally I don't check on yelp before eating somewhere new. Risky, I know, but I prefer my opinion to be unbiased to the fullest.  This is one of those times that I wish I had...  I stopped in on my way to Costco because I hadn't seen it before. I am a sushi lover and love checking out new places in Markham. It was dead - not a single person there but me- and in hindsight, I get it.   I got the bento box with chicken teriyaki, steamed rice, 3 piece California and spicy salmon (I asked for all spicy salmon) 3 pieces salmon sushi and tempura, which consisted of one small shrimp and a few slivers of vegetable. It also came with the standard miso soup and salad.  Where to begin? The salad was terrible and incredibly small. We're talking a mouthful here, a few pieces of lettuce, a chunk of cucumber and some stringed carrot covered in what I presume was teriyaki sauce. The miso was lukewarm and watery and probably the worst miso soup I've ever had. The stuff I make at home out of a bag tastes miles better.  Then the bento came. The chicken was tiny little chunks of white rubbery substance, mixed with a watery teriyaki sauce. Somehow it was cold, which is odd because it seemed like they just cooked it. I got a pea sized piece of wasabi and no ginger, which I had to ask for. The only redeeming part of the meal was the spicy salmon, which had a nice flavour and was made the way I liked it. The salmon sushi was average in every way.  It came up to $17.80 after a modest tip and was the single worst bento box I've had. I am a bit of a sentimentalist so I like to give small places a chance. But I honestly cannot beleive they are still in business with the really poor value they deliver for no small sum. I will never go here again. You'd honestly be better off getting a hot dog down the street at Costco for $1.50. Seriously.   I highly recommend avoiding this place, unless you have a streak of sadomasicism in you want want to support a tiny, unsatisfactory sushi place that is likely a money laundering front... it's the only way I can understand how they are still in business."}
{"text":"Ya, don't even bother going here.  I went there twice in all my years here in Montreal. Once with my family a few years back and we had a lot of attitude and bad service back then. So I never came back until this year.  So I went there this year thinking the place might have changed but instead when I got there, I got led to my table to order but after a while, I noticed that I was getting ignored and the Asian people working there were only paying attention only to Asian customers and serving them it seems. That screams so much of xenophobic attitudes. Pitiful that the city of Montreal allow such establishments like this to stick around. I want to puke.  I felt unwanted there and not to mention, payment is only done by cash there. Seems shady to me."}
{"text":"A decent place for all you can eat, salmon is always fresh, teriyaki is very good, beef tataki is a must-have! The red bean/green tea ice-cream is my favorite, always keep one bucket in my own fridge. I got many bad reviews from my friends for this place, but there is always a long line outside the front door at dinner hours, guess there ARE a lot of fans out there anyway."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today.  PROS The staff was very friendly and the food was served promptly. The food itself was alright, nothing special. The miso soup was a little too salty, but still tasty. Maybe it's the powder they use. Shrimp tempura was tasty though. No complaints there. The ambiance is alright, nothing that really stands out.  CONS I did not like yakitori in my bento box. They skimped on the chicken by putting some green veggies in between pieces of chicken. Not cool. For $17+tax I'd expect 2 full skewers of chicken.  Honestly, I didn't find this restaurant special. I would not go here for dinner. Lunch, maybe, but probably not likely."}
{"text":"SERVICE: 5/5 Exceptional service. Friendly and courteous. The family that runs this restaurant is very sweet and nice.  FOOD: 2/5 Mediocre quality of food at best. Sure, you get what you pay for. $5 maki are hard to come by in Toronto, let alone in this part of town. I suppose you get what you pay for. If you're after really cheap maki, then this place is hard to beat. If you're after quality and taste, then I would not recommend this place. Even though the people who run this restaurant are really great at making you feel welcome, I just didn't like the quality of rice and ingredients to warrant a second trip to this place."}
{"text":"Lost in a sea of sushi places in the area, I've walked past Tokyo Sushi a bazillion times without ever stopping in. I came in here for lunch and thought it was pretty decent. I ended up getting a bento box and was thoroughly stuffed afterwards. I didn't think any of the food was outstanding, but very comparable to many of the sushi joints in the area."}
{"text":"Love their chirachi which is priced more fairly than most down town locations! The staff is great and usually fairly accommodating of dietary needs. When I got take out for lunch they got me in and out of the restaurant in less than 5 mins!!! The sushi chef actually directly took my order when he saw me looking at the take out menu. Their dinner chirachi had more pieces than the lunch special, and definitely worth it"}
{"text":"Ordered for pickup, service was quick and the sushi was delicious! The presentation was very nice as well! 100% will be going back!"}
{"text":"Tokyo Sushi is probably my favourite place to get lunch with the boyfriend, partially because it is across from The Common, partially because the space feels decently intimate and calm, and mostly because the sushi is better value than anything else on Bloor. Yeah that's right even New Gen.  The fish is fresh and the fish-to-rice ratio is higher than the price would suggest.   We usually go for some combo of maki, in which I don't recommend the spicy versions unless you dig that strange pink mayo. The sashimi here is also good, and the $16 combo has been too much for both of us to eat multiple times.   The service is great - they are speedy until they handle your plates at the table, at which point they are hyper careful, and hilariously slow moving. It think of it as the dinner theatre favour of the meal, like a free miso, or a small ambiguously flavoured candy, writ social.  Sure there's some sushi puns I could make here, sure there are.   But I won't do it."}
{"text":"Such a gem.  I love this restaurant, tucked away between yonge and Bay streets next to bubble tea and another small dessert store.    Sometimes I'll get the deluxe chirashi Don which has everything your heart can desire.  The kamikaze Don is slightly cheaper but has my faves, uni and ikura. These bowls are just the perfect size and the quality is way better than most sushi joints in this area.   10/10, recommend cuz quality."}
{"text":"bonne variété et service rapide, le personnel est très serviable.  un peu plus de photo sur le menu serais apprécié quand on ne connais pas beaucoup les sushi"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends the other day and it was a quick walk from Wellesley station. It's not on a major road so it was a bit tricky to find at first. Once we got there we were immediately greeted by the nicest waitress. We got a table and shortly after found out another friend was coming and asked to move and the waitress was wonderful and accommodating. I would say everything here was fairly standard but good. Sushi was good, chirashi was good, bento boxes were good. Nothing mind blowing like Jabistro but still solid. If you want decent sushi for a fair price you should give it a try. Bonus points for wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Their sushi was good, not something very special but enough to help you fill in a hungry stomach. I recommend going here for lunch as the price is very reasonable. One bad thing about this place is that the menu does not have sashimi, which is bizarre for a sushi place IMO. Service is pretty quick. Just a warning: They don't take cards, so be prepare to bring in some cash!"}
{"text":"Ordered Tokyo sushi on justeat.ca  It was ok. No mind blowing experience but it hit the spot that, on occasion, only sushi will hit.  Had a dynamite roll, a green dragon roll, and a spicy salmon hand roll. All three was good and the hand roll was tastier than ones I've had before so that's duly noted.  I RECOMMEND: their hand rolls   EXTRA TIP: don't forget to specify spicy mayo while ordering if you wish, but it's not complementary"}
{"text":"Nowadays with all the AYCE Japanese restaurants everywhere in GTA. It is not easy to run a Japanese a la carte restaurants if  one does not provide fresh fish, good food and good services.  Tokyo Sushi is one of those a la carte restaurants in the area of at least 4 AYCE and I would have to say the quality of food is below par with some of the AYCE.  The restaurant is really quiet for lunch Only 3 tables including myself. There are seatings at the sushi bar and private room. The private room is quite cozy, seats around 4 people and offer a lot of privacy.  There are all day $8.95 combos that includes miso soup, a combination of rolls/sushi/teriyaki/tempura. I decided on Combo D with the sushi and maki combination. I have to say the problem that the sushi/maki did not taste good, is the rice! The rice was so overcooked. They are all mashy and stick together...it made the sushi tasted really heavy.. I really did not enjoy them at all!  The service though is fast and friendly. There is that little bell in the room if you want their services.  BTW, the menus, they really need to wash them or something.. they are so sticky! Oh so gross!!  They accepts AMEX, Mastercard, Visa and Interact!"}
{"text":"This place has got to be one of the best sushi places in town! The food is incredibly fresh, it's full of flavour and they do not spare on the rice/ingredients.  I've been to many, many sushi places - and I literally go out of my way to come here.   The service is pretty slow if you're dining in - but I highly, highly recommend calling in and doing take-out.  You will not be disappointed.   My favourite roll from here, you ask..?  Philadelphia roll with a side of spicy mayo."}
{"text":"Great sushi place. They serve excellently prepared sashimi and maki. I tried the sashimi boat as well as the udon noodles and they both were delicious. The staff was very friendly and I highly recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"????????yelp?????????????????????????sashimi don,???????????????????????????????????????????????????don???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Tokyo Sushi is a well known establishment on St. Joseph Street. To be fair, I have only tried the Friday Roll (eel, avocado, cucumber) ($5.50), the shiitake mushroom roll ($3.50), the hamachi hand roll ($4.00) and Spicy Chirashi Don (approx. $16).   However, I echo fellow reviewers, the food is expensive for the quality. The eel tasted as if it had sat in the fridge for a little longer than it should. The Spicy Chirashi Don is recommended if you have to choose from the menu. It has good flavours (wasabi and spicy mayo) with very little evidence of sashimi mixed with imitation crab.The portions, overall were smaller than most places. I would not recommend Tokyo Sushi House unless you are out of options in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Fresh, quick and friendly service. Intimate interior but never a problem finding seating. The spider roll is always a hit as is their sashimi."}
{"text":"Me and my wife had dinner there and were pleasantly surprised by the quality and the quantity of our order. We both ordered bento boxes and we really enjoyed the tempura, the sashimi and the sushi  as well as the rolls that were included. The salad and soup were also delicious. The next day we decided to try another sushi joint which seemed to be getting more and better reviews but we were really disappointed.   We won't mention the name of the other sushi place but we might review it at another time separately.  But we will definitely revisit Tokyo sushi and hope they keep up the good work."}
{"text":"The restaurant was completely empty and the food took a bit longer than expected to come out, but the food was quality for sure. You get several complimentary dishes to go with the meal to start, and they really are generous with them. I got the salmon teriyaki with tempura and everything was delicious. For a pretty budget lunch spot, they do seem to take a lot of care in making the food and making it look good too. I especially appreciated that they don't use the salty/bad kind of tempura sauce that some cheaper sushi restaurants use. Theirs has a tinge of sweetness to it."}
{"text":"Note, I only tried them once (tourist from the US) I ordered the kakimaze don which includes two types of tobiko, ikura, squid, salmon, tuna, eel, uni, and a poached egg. I am probably being particular, but the fish was haphazardly chopped so that they were in pieces but a few were still strung together and I felt like they put way too much egg and not enough fish. I would have much preferred if the fish was served in sashimi style slices (a la chirashi) than the little chunks. The quality was not exceptional and other than the wide selection of donburis there is nothing exceedingly special about the menu.   Nevertheless, it's tasty but it wouldn't be something I'd order again."}
{"text":"Ended up here because Hina is closed on Mondays.  We walked in to a relatively empty restaurant at 8pm.  We ordered edamame, two sashimi specials, on Tokyo Special, and a vegetarian bento box.    For edamame, there was so much salt we were trying to brush some of it off.  The vegetarian in the group commented that the tempura was greasy and not crispy at all.    The sashimi was 8 pieces of salmon, 4 pieces of tilapia (posing as snapper), 2 hamachi, 1 saba, 3 tuna, and 3 seared white unknown origin.  The only thing that was really quality, surprisingly, was the saba.  The tuna was thawed and mushy, the tilapia was...tilapia (ew), and the hamachi was cut by someone that doesn't know how to cut sushi.  Disappointing.    To top it all off, we never received a refill on any of our water or tea.    There are better places in the area.  Hina, though not standout, is much better than here.  We're not coming back here."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery and it arrived an hour later, right within the expected delivery time. The food was good for the price; I spent $36, with tax and tip, and got a soup, appetizer, 3 rolls, and sashimi. They also gave me complimentary salads and extra soup. I would try definitely try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, and super super service. The owner constantly serves extra pieces or complimentary pieces. The decoration looks beautiful and the price is very handsome for its taste and amount!"}
{"text":"Tokyo Sushi is a small place on the south side of Bloor with windows looking out to the street. A set of double doors opens into a tightly packed collection of small Japanese-styled booths and a sushi bar that runs along one side of the tiny restaurant. The size of the place spoke to the fact that it catered to take out more than street trade. The menu featured an assortment of sushi, sashimi, udon and don dishes and a couple of Korean plates. Between us we had some sushi, some sashimi, a bowl of udon and a sizzling plate of Bulgogi. Everything was plated with an attention to detail, and although some of the sashimi servings were small, everything was delicious. The quality and food was expected for the price that was paid. It was a good local sushi place and a nice way to end a Saturday afternoon with friends."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, and the sushi is very well made.  The miso soup is subpar.  Portions are a really good size, and my vegetarian boyfriend really enjoyed his food as well.  I was a little nervous to try this place because of the decor when you look in the windows.  But I wanted to give it at least one chance.  The decor is awful.  The place is super dusty and the lighting is harsh.  If they just changed all of the lightbulbs in the place to soft white (instead of the harsh office white or day white or whatever they have now) it would make a WORLD OF DIFFERENCE.    The best part of the meal was the complimentary yam noodles.  I'm not a huge fan of them usually, but at this place they are AWESOME.  I couldn't get enough!"}
{"text":"Perhaps this restaurant changed management. The prices are much higher while the amount decreased significantly."}
{"text":"My husband and I had food poisoning! A doctor friend tells me it was most certainly the sushi. Would give ZERO stars if I could. Automatic 15% tip to the bill even though we were only 3 people. Cash only ~ seriously?? If you want to pay $100 cash for food poisoning, go here."}
{"text":"It looks like a dingy place from the front, in fact I thought it was a convenient store...  But this place is amazing. The sea urchin sushi (i love sea urchins) is actually large!!! By large, I really mean it's comparable to what I ate in Hong Kong! Other restaurants in Toronto have served me only a tiny piece, this place served me enough sea urchin to cover the sushi :) mmmmmmm I love sea urchins  I ordered the Kaisen Don, octopus, scallops, tamago (Japanese sweet egg), and salmon roe. With rice at the bottom. This was really good, the seafood so fresh and neatly placed on the rice. I got full quickly actually...  My friend's Chirashi Don was AMAZING! A bit spicy too!   Service was good, she was quick to come when we called and the food was served fast.  Total = $50"}
{"text":"14 bucks for all you can eat sushi lunch!!  How can you go wrong  I have been here twice and both times i had trouble walking out because I ate so much.  They have a wide variety of sushi (and by that i mean maki), hand rolls and your other usual sushi things, but they also have a huge selection of noodles, meat and fish, they even have french fries and onion rings, so if you go with people who aren't big on sushi they have other thins to choose from  The service was good.  Water always full, and the order paper is taken quickly.  So far I have only had i think 2 dishes forgotten, but I'm happy they forgot it because if they had remembered it i would have been too full to eat it!!  GO GET SUSHI!!"}
{"text":"Food are ok but somehow always miss this place from time to time, so I have been here for so many times that I lost count"}
