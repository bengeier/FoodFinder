{"text":"Our go to for a great pizza. Always order the Napoli special because we're boring and it's delicious!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Napoleon pizza you can find in neighborhood, you can realize there is no frozen ingredients in your first bite. We always order pizza from this place even though is not cheap but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Just delicious pizza. Fast delivery and everybody loved it. Not pizza pizza prices but much better quality. I'd rather support these guys and pay a bit extra for fresh food made with care."}
{"text":"I was at a friend's place at Yonge and Finch and he told us he ordered a pizza from his favorite spot and that he had been going there 30 years. Pizza arrived piping hot and was probably the best pizza I have had in a while. Really impressed. Not sure how much it cost but it was exceptionally good,"}
{"text":"Very solid thin crust pizza, one of the better delivery joints in the neighborhood, but the other menu items are definitely a mixed bag.  I also enjoy their meatball sandwich, but I find the veal sandwich light on filling compared to competitors like California Sandwiches Etc. and therefore the sandwich is a bit 'bready' and dry.  The fish and chips were a really strange experience. With very solid freshly battered fish, but paired with horrific stale McCain frozen 'crispy fries' with the flavourless painted-on starchy coating that I absolutely hate. And to make it worse, I was not only sent ridiculous little packets of the cheapest FoodService tartar sauce possible, but they were clearly several years past their 'best before' dates, and had turned brown and translucent - see pics below.  The pork Souvlaki on a pita was pretty solid, the pita was very good, the pork was nicely flavored, but the very small chunks of meat caused it to be a little bit overcooked, and unfortunately they were also stingy with the tzatziki sauce.  So if you stick to the pizza, I had the house special with 5 toppings for the price of 3, and perhaps a meatball sandwich, ?ask for extra sauce on the side?you'll probably enjoy this place a lot.  But definitely avoid the fish and chips, skip the veal sandwich, and if you go for the Souvlaki on a pita, make sure you ask for, or order, extra tzatziki on the side.  Overall, definitely a huge step up from the generic pizza chains, whose phone number you've memorized, just be careful what you order."}
{"text":"I LOVE this pizza. I have ordered it for delivery a few times this month and it was delicious. I even ordered a party size pizza for a cocktail party I had in case some people didn't like the sushi I was serving and EVERyONE devoured the pizza. Huge hit. The crust, sauce, and cheese are all of amazing quality. This is my new go to for pizza delivery."}
{"text":"Their pizza was really delicious and they deliver. We ordered zucchini, onion, sausage and pepperoni. The sausage was good quality and sliced, the zucchini was fresh and same was the onion. Delivery man was courteous and we ordered from just-eat, and the pizza delivered was hot."}
{"text":"Used to be the best pizza in TO when it was the original owner. Since he sold the business years ago this place really sucks. Wonder why the present owners changed the pizza recipe? Neapolitan pizza, ya right."}
{"text":"Disgusting! I wasn't expecting much as this is just a little corner shop but after waiting over an hour, I finally got the pizza which was so bad I literally threw it out. I used to think pizza was one of those things where even if it was bad, it was still pretty good. I stand corrected. On the bright side, my dog thought it was ok."}
{"text":"I love their Gyros. These dudes are cookin' up the good shit. I would have given them 5 , but I had to wait 20 minutes for a take out order the first time I ate there. Second time, I just called ahead."}
