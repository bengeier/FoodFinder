{"text":"I tried Anatolia a few weeks ago while passing by the Olympic Park. I was unconvinced at first as the restaurant was totally empty (lunchtime during weekend) but decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did. I tried their Mediterranean Salad which was fresh and good, the appetizer Lahmacun (looks like a pizza) - very good, and a stuffed eggplant -also very good. The spices are just right. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent addition to Calgary's restaurant scene. Turkish food in a very elegant setting. So easy to go a show at Arts Common from there. The service is excellent, and the food comes quickly. Delicious Turkish breads, and wonderful main courses. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Finally, a Turkish restaurant in Calgary, and a really nice one too. I was so looking forward to try the food!  First of all, the interior: This place is quite big with a high ceiling. They managed to design it in a way that it's is still cozy and comfortable. They have regular tables as well as booths for a bit more privacy, 100 seats in total. And a private room upstairs for 50 people. Great location to have a party at!   The service was great; very attentive and hospitable.   The food was good, although I was hoping for it to be even better. But mind you, my bar is set pretty high because I had awesome Turkish food both in Turkey and in Cologne, Germany.  The menu is still relatively small, but they said they are still working on it and trying to figure out, what people would want (they opened not even a month ago). They also want to change the menu frequently. Not too many vegetarian dishes available on the currently. Meat is either chicken, lamb, or beef (halal). The meat just fell of the lamp shank, it was so soft and juicy. The lamp skewer was good. The pide was a bit dry, I am used to it having cheese on it as well. All dishes are very reasonable priced!   The food could have been even more flavorful in my opinion, more spices. There wasn't even chili on the table which is usually very common. I also hoped to see a bigger variety of dishes on the menu, like Ciftlik Sac, Manti, Beyti, and more appetizer options. But again, they just started and are still working on the menu. I'm certainly coming back!   You won't find any alcohol on the menu, but you can bring your own bottle and won't even be charged a corkage fee. That alone is a good reason to try this restaurant!   The owner also has a kiosk at crossroads market (same name) which has been around for quite a few years I think."}
{"text":"A Turkish dining delight. A descriptive, yet unremarkable name this place offers authentic Turkish food in an amazing space across from City hall.  The Traditional baking, made fresh daily, is served with humus as a great start to succulent grilled lamb.  Having sampled more baklava than I care to admit, the modest presentation by Anatolia Turkish Restaurant results in the richness of Turkish culture and history come alive on the palette in several wonderful bites.  I could see the staff pointing at me saying  \"Etekleri zil Ã§al?yor\" as I finished the last bite.  To keep you from contently have a satisfied nap, the Experience finishes with Turkish coffee which will keep you talking all night about this dining experience.  You have to eat, best to eat well,"}
{"text":"The food is excellent! The variety of the specials is tremendous! The lunch special is such a reasonable price for the amount of food you get, and you're in and out in less than an hour, making it ideal for a downtown lunch! I highly recommend it! Me and my co-workers eat there at least twice a week!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place.. Food little overpriced, should add to serve bread who loves Turkish style bread for complimentary."}
{"text":"Took a little trip to the Crossroads Flea Market last Sunday with a notion to try something new. I chose Anatolia and it was straight up next level delicious. I had a Lamb Shank with all the side's and my girl had the Chicken Kabob meal. Perfect amount of succulent char on her kabob and my Shank was literally drinkable it was so saucy & tender. The salads and bread were both super fresh and flavorful and we ate for $20.00. Can't beat that. Highly recommended from this guy."}
{"text":"the food here is pretty yummy. i had this eggplant sauce with grilled veggies. ive never had turkish food before the spices were different. they dont have enough vegetraian options and the service needs to be improved."}
{"text":"Food was great. We ordered pide, lamb shank, lahmacun and an appetizer that came on a stone plate with spinach and shrimps. The pide was my favorite."}
{"text":"I guess I don't like Turkish food. I would probably give it a better rating if service was good but when you sit for anywhere from 5-10 minutes before you are given a menu in a near empty restaurant and another 10 minutes after you set the menu down before your order is taken and then when you finish your meal you are asked if you would like to have dessert or coffee and you answer yes and are ignored and forgotten (the 2 waiters were leaning at the bar directly behind me chatting away and my waiter never came back to offer me the dessert menu. The waiters never check on you to see if the meal is ok, don't come around to fill your water glass and never bother to see if there is anything you need. I started to wonder if it was because I was a woman dining alone but I watched and once they serve the meal you are pretty much left alone. I can forgive forgetting because it's very busy but when it's not really busy and I did say I wanted to order dessert and they just didn't bother... I eventually just turned around and asked for my bill. The food was basically non-descript. I was expecting more robust flavours or at least subtle and complex flavours but the flavour of the dish was basically salt and pepper and some tomato, maybe a hint of ginger, if there was more than that I couldn't tell. I had the Sultan's delight and the photo showed the meat sitting on a generous portion of creamy eggplant, I doubt if there was even a tablespoon worth on my plate, The best thing on the plate was the rice, perfectly cooked. The salad was ok too but hard to botch up a salad with lemon juice and oil dressing. I give them credit for serving the salad separately as my main arrived on a heated platter. There are several reviews from people who have more experience with Turkish food but I think if you have no experience then it would be better to try their take-out lunch or their location at the Crossroads Farmer's market, at least then you wouldn't be paying a much higher price for the food."}
{"text":"First of all the location of this restaurant is really excellent, located right next to olympic Plaza in the heart of the city.  The food is very good here, I came with my parents who lived in Turkey for 12 years. I had the eskender but I have to be honest: the sultans delight (one of the first items on the menu) is incredible and I highly recommend it. The desert and the appetizers were good too and definitely worth it.   4 stars over 5 stars just because it isn't the best Turkish food in the world but certainly the best I've had in calgary."}
{"text":"Sooooo delicious..... Appetizers and main meal were so good. Service was fabulous. Unfortunately, they were running out of caneffe.  Don't miss this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is okay - if they have what you want available.  I work in the area so have tried to eat there a couple times and each time they are out of 75% of the menu items, which is weird because it's never busy.   I came in with a group and the server was extremely rude to our whole table.  He basically said we could only order the daily special and huffed and puffed when some of the people in the group didn't want to.  We all got served at different times and and parts of the meal came at random.  For instance, some people got their salads while others got their salad with dessert.  We also had to ask for menus, which seems to insult the server and no one took beverage orders, they might only serve water as no other tables had beverages either.  If the food was great I would consider it again but very bland food and the worst service I've seen in a very long time.  I won't even start with the mice traps set up all over the restaurant."}
{"text":"Probably the worst buffet I've been too. They are cheap on putting meat out. Would not recommend it. Family members did not get any Kabab."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Gotta have the kunafe along with the rice pudding for dessert! Food didn't take too long to come. Restaurant is quite nice inside and fantastic location across from Calgary Olympic Plaza skating rink."}
{"text":"Was terribly dissapointed with the service. It was a busy night, however, it took 20 minutes to get a glass of water which was not refilled. We ordered the chicken kabob plate which comes with a salad but ours did not. We asked about the salad and did receive it AFTER we had finished our meal. The chicken was delicious but I won't be running back based on the dining experience. It should be noted the servers were all very friendly but the staff all seemed confused and disorganized."}
