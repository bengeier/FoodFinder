{"text":"La movida was recommended to us by a friend and I am so glad we came!   We got the prix fix menu for 4+ and it was way more than enough food for 6!  The tapas were all really good, especially the potatoes and the garlic shrimp.   The paella was the main attraction though, it was absolutely perfect!   The service was impeccable, the owner himself was out helping put the plates out and was very kind!   Highly recommend this place for groups!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. The food is excellent, you should really try the bravas, it's the only place in Montreal where you can find them as they are made in Spain. But the service is BAD. We were a table of 9 people. Reservation was properly made on tuesday that same week. When we got there, they didn't find our name. Well, no big deal, they just arranged a table for us. The waiter was very nice at the beginning, we were all spanish speaker and the atmosphere was very nice. But then we ordered wine. The waiter thought we deserved something more, so he offered a wine that was not in the wine list because the one we ordered was the \"SAQ type\"...then we ordered water...first two bottles and we didn't complain. But then we asked for regular tap water...big deal, it seems Montreal water has chloride as the waiter insisted on remind us...we had to keep ordering water, because  the waiter disappeared...and no, no more costumers were there, only us....we had to repeatedly ask for the desert which, by the way, are not at the same level of the rest of the food, and the check took a good while until we got it....overall the service was efficient, it was too noticeable that he only wanted to sell us the most expensive wines and waters and made us feel bad because we decided to ask for tap one since we were ordering expensive wine...As is my right, I showed my disconformity tipping only 10%...the waiter confronted me and after a back and forth of threatens from her side asked ME to talk to his supervisor...which I still don't understand...I found it humiliating, and I only regret that I couldn't take back that 10% and leave 0 tip."}
