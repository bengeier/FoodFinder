{"text":"Came here to celebrate my mom's birthday with my family. Since it was a Monday night, the restaurant was quite empty. That said, you can see that the tables are arranged to give everyone ample and spacious seating room. As we were only a party of four, we couldn't order much to share. In the end, we got the following:

- Fuqi Feipian 
This beef shank and tripe in hot chili oil came doused in red hot coloured oil. My family found it spicy, though I personally didn't notice the spice at all. Unlike some of the other versions we've had, this particular dish had a very strong star anise flavour, which did overpower the flavour profile. There were also very few pieces of tripe - it was all thin but large horizontal cuts of beef intersecting with tendon and fat. Overall, a 3/5.

- Salt and pepper fried bullfrog legs
This was truly the highlight of the night! The bullfrog legs were fried to fall apart at the touch - they were tender and delicious. The taste and seasoning was also perfectly executed, and I really wish we had ordered a bowl of rice to accompany this dish! Full of wok air.

- Fried and steamed mantou
I personally had the steamed version (with condensed milk, of course!). It was decent - fairly fluffy. Slightly on the bland side, but that just made it a good vessel for shoveling condensed milk into my mouth!

- Braised beef noodles
These noodles were so good! The portion of the noodles was fairly generous - there were thick meaty beef briskets served with lots of wheat noodles. The broth was also sufficiently rich and the brisket tender.

- Lamb hotpot
At first, I was pleased by the size of this pot and by the gracious servings of lettuce accompanying this dish. However, I quickly realized that the majority of the pot consisted of bean curd and water chestnuts, and soon became very disappointed. For a dish priced at nearly $30, the restaurant was extremely stingy and gave us only roughly 8 chunks of lamb. There was barely enough meat the go around. The taste was okay, but I can honestly get a much better deal at a comparable price elsewhere.

Overall, it was an okay meal, but definitely pricey for what it was worth. Next time, I think I'll order just the noodles, as I found their hot pots and other dishes to be overpriced."}
{"text":"It's a true China style restaurant. With dumplings, noodles , and seafood too. For some reason it was super cold inside today.

However, after we sat down, more and more customers came in and it was a full house on a Sunday lunch.  All of them Chinese. And many are older generation, which shows you this restaurant is the real deal. 

Menu is on an iPad with Chinese and English so that was pretty cool. At first, I was taken back at $8-9 noodle bowls.  

But when it arrived the portion was HUGE. One bowl can fees 2 male adults or 3 average eaters. The down part was the Wonton noodles that we picked,  didn't have any veggies in them. Normally I would see some lettuce or something. 

We ordered the chicken Dumpling, but the skin was too thick and it seemed tough. Reheated from day old dumplings?  

There's many dishes to try so we shall go back. For now 3 stars."}
{"text":"Worst service ever !
We ordered through the convenience  of using an I pad in less than 5 min.
After waiting, 1/2 an hour we ask the waitress for our food she said it will be ready in 5min. Meanwhile a couple of tables that came after had a full table served.
1/2 an hour passed by and we simply told the waitress to forget the order and left."}

tasteless food
poor ingredients


My wife and I went to China Impression tonight. For me, this was the worst Chinese food I had in last 5 years.  The beef dish I ordered was completely tasteless.  I think the cook forgot to put any salt. Besides no salt, barely any flavor was detectable.   We also ordered the curry chow fun, and it was the worst chow fun I had.   The tofu fish dish was terrible as well.  The mushroom tasted very dated, past expiration and the fish they put into the dish was bony and very fishy.

This was by far the worst dining experience in so far as Chinese food is concerned in Mississauga.

The restaurant is brightly lit and clean so it looks tempting.   But those of you who are willing to dare, remember I warned you.

I will wager a bet that this place will not last 24 months.  This was by far the worst Chinese food I tasted in Mississauga.

{"text":"Order from an iPad but it's not a buffet.  By default, the menu will be in Chinese.  Change to English by touching the globe icon (language) at the top of the screen.  I am giving 4 stars because most of the items on the menu are delicious but some are not and others are inconsistent.  The hot and sour soup has been inconsistent.  The ma po tofu is terrible.  The eggplant (see picture) is amazing.  Tofu with seafood is very bland.  The tiger shrimp with chilli is spicy and delicious.  Lots of gigantic shrimps made my tongue tingle.  Bullfrog legs are succulent and taste much better than chicken.  Bullfrog legs in soy sauce with  onions came in a big wok.  Melt in your mouth delicious but too much onions for my liking.  The bullfrog legs with chilli is very spicy and fantastic.  When it arrived, I could smell the chilli coating from across the table.  Chicken and mushroom soup with udon noodles was much bigger than we expected.  Lots of mushroom and chicken pieces with delicious udon noodles, this is another one of our favourite dishes."}
{"text":"When I had came to visit for lunch, the place is big and rather spacious. Since it just recently opened, I wouldn't have expected there to be much people eating here anyways. Their menu style is iPad so they do not have any paper menus to look at when you are there.

Prices are reasonable and portions are big ... ordered the beef brisket noodle soup for $10 and the size of the bowl was absolutely enormous. Their deep fried mantao bread is also well deep-fried, very nicely done with a golden crisp.

All in all, I am willing to try it out again of the different dishes they have later. It is located in the same plaza as Hawaii Bakery near the convenience store on Burnhamthorpe."}
{"text":"Location/Service:
I've been here twice now with my family to try out this new restaurant. Word has it that it is opened by the same owner as Bashu at Hurontario/Eglinton since the menu is very similar and they also take orders via an ipad! I love technology and I love it when restaurants use tech/paperless options to take orders. It allows me to remove things and order dishes at my own pace. It also lets me see the total bill so I know I have enough cash at the end! All restaurants seriously need to adapt to this concept!! This particular restaurant is situated right next to Hawaiian Bakery. To be honest, you wouldn't know that there's a restaurant there unless you heard it from someone. This location has been empty (or at least not restaurant owned) for such a LONG time. 

The staff there are pleasant. They get things done quickly, whether it be cleaning up the tables or getting enough chairs/plates/chopticks for you. The restaurant is quite big too so there's a lot of space between tables.

Food:
From the two visits, some of the things we ordered were:
1. Sesame Pancake with Beef ($7.95)
- this was alright, it wasn't the best sesame pancake that I ever had. I wouldn't order this again. 

2. Mixed beef with Hot sauce ($11.50)
- this is an appetizer and it is pretty good. It has a lot of meat and great as a starter. I don't think other places have this kind of dish. 

3. Braised beef handmade noodle hot soup ($9.99)
- This is probably the best dish of the night. In fact, we loved it so much the first time we went that we ordered it again the second time. It isn't too spicy, and it is a HUGE bowl of handmade noodles that really warms your soul when you eat it in super cold water. I really enjoy this beef brisket bowl. This is also my family's favourite.

4. Sichuan Wonton with Garlic Sauce ($7.99)
- This is wayyyy too spicy for my liking. The wontons are small and comes in a puddle of oily spicy sauce. I think the main point of the dish is the chili sauce. My family really liked the dish and used the chili oil for other noodle dishes. If you like spicy food, like those that make your lips and tongue numb, this will for sure hit the spot.

5. Sh-port with sweet Peking sauce ($13.99)
- Nothing special about this dish. Better to order it at Cantonese restaurant. 

Overall, the price is good. I would definitely come back to try other dishes, like the stews and the hot pot!"}
{"text":"Went here again to try more things because we came with a bigger group of people! More people = more food!!

I especially want to highlight the fish soup if you're a big fan of soups. The fish soup is kept heated at the table and the pot contains a lot of toppings too from black fungus to mushrooms and radishes. The tofu in the pot was very soft and flavourful. 

We also ordered the chicken rice steamed in a lotus leaf. For the price point, you get a good portion of the dish and you get a complimentary cup of soy milk too (either hot or cold!). 

My family liked the cubed radish cakes that was mixed with a Chinese sauce and egg. I thought the dish was on the flavor less side but my family really love the dish so you can be the judge yourself!

All the other dishes tasted alright, nothing particularly stood out for me to highlight here though!"}
