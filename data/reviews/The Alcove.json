{"text":"I was in the area for work and heard good things. 

Service was pleasant and quick. Food was good. 

Simple!

With the number of employees in the area I am sure there is a rush during lunch or morning."}
{"text":"Easy, fast, delicious. No simpler than that. You wont wait in lines, theres ample seating if you don't get it to go and its light on your wallet. A place where you can get in and out for an awesome lunch on any given day gets 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place got good reviews. Got a Reuben - chewy corned beef - not editable. The fries were cold great and soggy. Definitely not going back here"}
{"text":"Real real real real deal. I would reccomend the Cubano or Buffalo Chicken Wrap.  Come hungry, you will leave happy.  Hats off to the chef and the owner!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Everything I've eaten here has been excellent. They have the best fries. I would reccommend any of the panninis. If you are short on time, call ahead, this place gets busy. They have a very nice eat in area also, the staff are very freindly. They are open M-F till 3:00.The portions are a good size also for the money."}
{"text":"Very good, I only had the Reuben twice and it was excellent, may be a bit over priced though and needs the kosher pickle."}
{"text":"My office is located within walking distance of this gem. I end up coming back to my office raving about the delicious lunch I just ate. Today was no exception. I ordered the oriental chicken salad on special, and it was delicious: Mixed greens with super fresh veggies, and the crispiest, most amazing wonton strips I've ever had. The dressing was perfection, sweet and creamy. I definitely envied the fries I saw coming out on other plates, but I went for a healthier lunch today."}
{"text":"hidden gem. fast service, great hot sandwiches, the perfect lunch spot."}
{"text":"Delicious! My favs are the cubano and buff chicken wrap. Also, do not sleep on the chicken noodle soup. Handmade by chef Nick."}
{"text":"This is a great little lunch spot near where I live. I don't work in Parkway Center but I live nearby and work from home, so on my \"treat yo self\" days I will order lunch from here.

The thing about The Alcove is that pretty much everything on the menu sounds good. Some of my favorites are the Cajun Turkey Caesar Wrap, Honey Mustard Chicken Wrap, Turkey Club Wrap, and Chicken Pesto Panini. AND YOU GUYS. The fries are life changing. I'm not sure what's happening there but they're SO good.

When you see it, you think, oh. This is probably the standard little cafe/deli in every office building. But it's so much better than that! Their food is cafe/deli food kicked up about a hundred notches, so much so that I go out of my way to visit. I really recommend if you're ever in the area!"}
{"text":"Other than the birth of my child, I can honestly say that finding the Alcove is the best thing that's ever happened to me. I travelled to Pittsburgh for a few weeks and was working in Greentree. My life changed forever the first time I stepped foot in the corporate office park building. I never knew that sandwiches could be so delicious and fries so crispy. I ate there for 12 straight days. Normally eating greasy diner food at such a pace would leave me feeling sluggish and my blood sludgy, but the Alcove is the exception to this rule. I felt stronger than I ever have. I swear I could have lifted a car after eating the Chicken Parm Toasted Hoagie. The Lord Stanley gave me a sense of peace usually reserved for Buddhist monks. I literally cried tears of joy as I devoured the Honey Mustard Chicken wrap.

The only downside is I had to eventually move on from my two week training and away from the Pittsburgh area. Everyday is a struggle with some days being harder than others, but I think I'm going to make it. In some ways it's a relief knowing that my life peaked on a rainy Wednesday afternoon; I know it'll never get better than having Red Hot Chili Peppers blasted into my ear drums as I enjoy a perfectly constructed Patty Melt. But everyday at lunch I get a craving that I know nothing can fully satisfy. I'm lucky to have had the Alcove fill my stomach, but without it I know nothing will ever truly fill the empty space it left."}
{"text":"Amazing salad with blackened salmon and french fries. Everything came out quickly but was definitely high quality."}
{"text":"I just found this new little gem next to my work.... And very happy I did, being that a few of my favorite places for lunch closed recently(Italian Bread Place, and Sojourn). I went to lunch with a co-worker. When you walk in the employees are very welcoming and it looks like a great place for lunch. The menu was perfect and the food was pretty great also. I got a buffalo chicken wrap with a side of homemade chips and a green tea. My co worker got a chicken pesto caprese salad that looked and smelled awesome. I will be back to try some other things on the menu. Great price, great food, great atomosphere. I will be here weekly, and so will some of my co workers."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place.  I work near the Alcove and everything we've had there has been delicious.  I'm partial to the Chicken Pesto Panini.  A friend of mine is addicted to the Caesar Salad with Chicken.  We've had them cater lunches for us and it was outstanding.  So happy they opened up in Greentree."}
{"text":"Visiting from Redding CA for job training. Five of us walked over for lunch and every meal was amazing. Fast fresh tasty. French fries and chip were perfect and crispy"}
{"text":"Just found out this place was here. Had the poutine on my first trip . A little risky, but well played. Tasty and right amount of gravy and cheese. Looking forward to trying a Rachel. Everyone's food looks great."}
{"text":"I am visiting a call center in the vicinity and the site director recommended The Alcove. If they ever have their daily special of a California burger with deep fried avocado then I suggest you order because it is amazing! The fries were very crispy and the lunch was a huge hit!"}
{"text":"This place gets busy so call in if you're trying to go for lunch.  Typically have to wait in line to pay for lunch.  Can take about 10-20 min to pay/get food.  I always get mine to go.  The food is good I recommend blackened salmon Cesar."}
{"text":"Folks have raved about the fries, but I felt like chips. Homemade, hot out of the fryer! Wow! How cool is that. I had a special hoagie with turkey, pepperoni, banana peppers, lettuce, tomato and a spicy siracha mayo. The hoagie roll was fresh and delicious as was the entire sandwich. 

I also had a hard time finding the place. Follow the signs to Building 4, which is above Quest Diagnostics. The Post Office is right next door in the same building."}
{"text":"The food is delicious here! Good selection of salads, sandwiches, paninis, and burgers. They also have a list of specials written on the wall when you are there (typically a salad option, a couple sandwich options, and sometimes an entree option). They also serve breakfast here and the veggie omelet I had was excellent!

One downside is that it fills up very quickly during lunch hour, but regardless it is a bit of a wait. I don't mind it too much, because the food is fresh and piping hot when it arrives, but it's hard to do on a 30 minute lunch break even though I work a couple buildings over! 

I just wish they would have more grab-and-go items (cold sandwiches or cold salads ready to go). I also wish they had more side items; although the fries are amazing, I think they should add another side option like potato salad, pasta salad, side tossed salad, etc! 

Their food is fresh, flavorful, vibrant, and piping hot; they just gotta make it more accessible to the Parkway Center workers because I'd definitely go more often if there was a grab-and-go station or menu!"}
{"text":"Thought it didn't get any better than their Shrimp Po'Boy but I was WRONG! Just had \"The Animal\" and fell in LOVE. Best lunch spot in the Burgh hands down."}
{"text":"I have been going to the alcove almost every weekday since they have opened. They have amazing food at a reasonable price with EXCELLENT service. Judy is absolutely wonderful to work with. We call in almost everyday with a whole list of orders for our office. She is always pleasant, chipper, and gives amazing recommendations. I would highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot to grab a lunch.  One thing I found out is that The Alcove does not open until at least 8:30.  So if you are interest in breakfast and coffee it has to be a little later.  Stopped by a couple of weeks ago a little before 8:30 after an early meeting and they were closed. Surprised about the late opening.  Wanted breakfast but could not wait for the opening time so moved on.  
Stop for lunch recently and was very happy with my Rueben and fries.  I ate in and my Rueben and fries were very hot and very good.  My fries were crisp and tasty but by the time I was finished my fries had cooled off and were not quit as good, so if you take out the fries probably need to be nuked to warm up.
It does get a crowd just after noon so there was a little wait but they then added a second person to take orders and the line to order moved fast.  The prices were very reasonable too."}
{"text":"I have been taking a class in a nearby location for the past two weeks. I've eaten lunch at the Alcove every day since the class began. I really can't say enough about how great this little gem is.  Everything is made with fresh, quality ingredients, but on top of the food being way above average for a small cafe, the staff is just unbelievable. They referred to me by my first name after my first purchase every day. That's just amazing and refreshing beyond measure!  

I highly recommend everything that I tried, listed below. 

The Cajun blackened salmon salad-so awesome. 
Chicken pot pie soup-as good as it sounds. 
Reuben with fries-like no other I've ever tasted. 
Pizza panini- totally hit the spot. 
Chef Salad-protein packed, guilt free salad with green leafy lettuce. 
Chicken salad with cranberries served with pita and cucumber slices-life changing. 

My only hope is that these folks consider opening up a second shop in my neighborhood, they are that good."}
{"text":"I brought a client here for a quick lunch and I was very pleasantly surprised! I was confused about the location because I work right down the road but never knew this was here. There's seating in the place for about 25-30 people, but It seemed like most people get takeout. I ordered the chicken pesto panini and It was delicious! The basil pesto mayo they use is incredible, and the sandwich was very well constructed. I also got a side of slaw (It was the creamy kind) and it was some of the best slaw I've had in Pittsburgh. This is my new favorite local lunch spot. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"It took me a while to find the location of this place but with some help I made it. It is part of the Parkway West complex of buildings just above where the former mall sat. The Alcove is located in building number 6 which also houses the main lab of Quest diagnostics. It sits just to the right of the Post Office.

Upon entering I was warmly greeted and given a menu which I would assume would be available for take out. With a Yelp check in you are entitled to a free cookie-chocolate chip or oatmeal raisin. He told me that their soup of the day was tomato which he said was excellent. I opted for one of their daily specials - chicken DeVinci on a hoagie roll. It comes with cheese, mushrooms, peppers and a tangy sauce. Since the sauce was a little to hot for me they substituted a marinara sauce in its place. He then told me that if I wanted to make it a combo I would get a fountain drink and a choice of either French fries or potato chips for just $2.00 more! I was amazed at the fact that most of their selections are under $10.00 just to start with! He also told me that breakfast items were available all day if I so chose.

After placing my order he gave me my chocolate chip cookie and took my name so they would bring it out to me. This place is small but it fills up fast over the lunch hour. I got my sandwich and fries in about 10 minutes and believe me it was so good, I was blown away! The fries were also delicious and even though I knew this was a probably a standard cookie I was amazed at how fresh it tasted! 

Basically all you have at your table are napkin dispensers. You get your condiments and utensils over at the fountain area. There is a separate area if you wish to purchase coffee. 

Among their offerings are various salads, hamburgers, hoagies, paninis, and wraps.  They have a listing for snacks and sides which include queso fritters, white cheddar macaroni and cheese, grilled cheese, hot dog or a cup of soup.

I can't wait to return and try something else on the menu. Good food, great service, and very reasonable prices. A definite must!"}
{"text":"I only found this place 2 weeks ago. They need a sign on greentree road or something. Lovely little sandwich shop. All the usual stuff but very tasty with fresh ingredients. I also enjoyed there burgers. Very convenient for pick orders.You can pull up right out front"}
