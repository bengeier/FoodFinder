{"text":"great customer service followed by flavourful starters & full filing entres and the best deserts"}
{"text":"Good Food, Good Service, decent prices. The first italian restaurant that I haven't had bolonaise that weeped in 10 years."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon, so we decided to go for dinner on Thursday evening.  The customer service was decent and the food was good, but they definitely could use some work on their service. We had to ask for water and if only one of us asked for more water, only one of us got it.  I asked to see a drink menu and was told they had red or white. When I asked what type, I was told \"red or white\". Lol  So we will likely go back, like I said the servers were really nice and the food was good, but their serving skills definitely need work."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant.  I had chicken Parm... the chicken was good. But the spaghetti tasted generic..like noodles with canned sauce. . We were disappointed... because we really wanted to support a local business.  I will say the service was good."}
{"text":"Great front end staff....terrible food.  They need to train a cook or hire someone with experience!  Missing main ingredients, raw garlic in sauce, packaged bread (baguette piece on plate)...over all just disappointing.  We both had pasta dishes...both were terrible :(   Trying to support local business but we sadly won't be back."}
{"text":"Had a quick meal here before our movie - happy to say the pizza was great and dessert awesome. Great service also. Very friendly and seen to all our needs. We'll be back :)"}
