{"text":"Wandered in here cold and hungry after a particularly mood-killing day and so happy I did! The space is really nicely decorated and super clean. Had the Spicy Beef soup with wheat noodles and it was delicious. The broth was flavourful and well-balanced, vegetables and noodles were cooked perfectly, the meat was melt-in-your mouth. The service was really friendly and attentive too. The server was always there to refill my water or drop off extra napkins. I had some broth left over so I ordered some extra noodles and veggies for it and took it to go. They only charged me $2, and threw in some extra. In the end my bill came to less than $14, including a 20-something percent tip, for what ended up being two delicious meals. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very clean, healthy, and refreshing... got the beef wheat noodle soup  and it definitely hit the spot"}
{"text":"I instantly loved this place. They play soothing music that puts you at ease as soon as you walk through the door. The noodles menu is short and to the point, with a few options for rice, casseroles, and appetizers on the back. The lady who sat us and took our order gave off such a gentle vibe that I felt like I was eating at someone's home.

The noodles were so satisfying. I had the spicy beef with wheat noodles and everything was cooked just right. They toned down the spiciness for me, as I asked, and the noodles were perfectly al dente. The broth was light yet flavourful. I regret not ordering the large size.

They currently take 5% off if you pay in cash. I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I got the wheat noodles with spicy pork ribs. The meat falls right off the bone, noodles were al dente. The food is on the bland side tho in my opinion."}
{"text":"First of all, the food is so delicious. The atmosphere is also so good. The price was too low and the food tasted really great. I recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant during their \"soft opening\" - had wheat beef noodles, really enjoyed it! The broth was tasty, had a good portion of both beef and noodles, and had some vegetables as well. The place was quite when we went around 9PM on a Wednesday. The atmosphere was nice and the place was really clean. The service was excellent as well. Definitely would recommend ."}
{"text":"Came on a tuesday evening around 6 and it was empty. Literally, no customers. Which of course means excellent photo-taking opportunities.

This is a relatively large restaurant with at least a couple dozen tables. Washrooms are accessible, and high seats are also available.

They specialize in noodle bowls, but there are other dishes available as well. You have a choice of rice or wheat noodles when ordering a bowl, and upsizing to a large costs only a dollar. I'm not sure how much bigger the large is compared to the regular though.

Tried both the beef and the pork ribs. The ribs were cooked tender and come with cartilage, which I like because it gives that extra crunch when you're chewing on the meat. The beef comes in thin slices. The amount of meat for both options is pretty generous, but I personally would go with the pork ribs.

The choice of broccoli as the main greens is a bit interesting; most places they usually do bok choy or something relatively cheap at the supermarkets.

The soup was also pretty good. I had the spicy soup and it pretty much overpowered everything, but having tried the non-spicy version, I think I would get it without the spice next time.

At $8 for a regular bowl, the prices are pretty competitive compared to other noodle shops, and while they don't use premium meats, it still tastes pretty good."}
{"text":"Landing Noodles is a Chinese restaurant that specializes in a variety of Chinese style noodle bowls located in downtown Toronto.

I have been there a few times and I normally order a large beef wheat noodle soup ($9.99 plus tax). I eat quite a bit of noodle soup bowls and I would have to say it's one of my favourite noodle soup bowls. The noodle bowl comes with a few slices of thinly cut beef, broccoli and noodles that are chewy and cooked perfectly. I think the real star is the broth. The broth tastes like a healthy cooked beef broth but the most impressive thing is they don't use msg at all. Many of their competitors use msg to give their broth a good flavour but this broth is all natural. If you eat enough Chinese soup noodle bowls you will understand what I'm referring to. It's nice to not be super thirsty after your meal also.

The restaurant decor is modern. The place is very large, spacious and very clean. Also, the restaurant owners are very nice and courteous.

I definitely recommend Landing Noodles if you are looking for a good bowl of Chinese noodles that is reasonably priced.

Tip: They offer a 5% discount for customers that pay their bill in cash."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the old cat cafe and I'm not sure if that was why it smelled odd. It definitely had a cat litter box smell when I went in but it's also a new restaurant so perhaps it's a paint smell? The owner served us and was very nice but seemed a bit unsure of herself. She also didn't check in with us to see how the food was going or if we needed something. I ordered the spicy beef noodles soup and it was good but I preferred Fudao just around the corner on Spadina. The beef just wasn't tasty and meaty enough for me and the noodles were a bit boring. They aren't licensed either if you were looking for alcohol but they have a range of coffee and tea drinks. 10 percent off if you pay in cash."}
{"text":"great noodles, atmosphere is quiet, clean, and unassuming. service was really nice too! i saw they had tea and lattes and wifi so it makes a nice spot to do work with your lunch too!"}
{"text":"Had the beef wheat noodles. Different style than GB Noodles, but I really enjoyed the broth- it was really flavourful, and noodles were cooked very well (al dente!). Service was also really good, the lady who owns the store is so sweet! Definitely coming back to try the other kinds of noodles :)"}
{"text":"really good noodles, owner was really nice and the broth is good"}
{"text":"Dropped in on a late arvo so the place was pretty empty. That being said, Great flavour to the soup and noodles were yum. Could do with more vegies though!"}
{"text":"Came here around 6pm, was very quiet. Server was friendly, ordered various items from a small menu. Spicy beef Noodle soup came out warm - mildly hot, broth lacked flavour, and tasted like soy sauce in hot water with a dallop of hotsauce. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Came here Friday night and had about 4 tables of twos. When you walk in you will smell strong herbal smell but the actual noodles itself didnt have too strong of herbal smell. Beef tasted better than pork ribs. They claim no M.S.G in soup but i think they added a lot of soysauce. The soup for the beef was hotter than the porkribs. 5% off if you pay cash."}
{"text":"I loved the noodles here! Service was good and location is super easy to find. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I ordered rib noodles. The taste is pretty authentic. This place is kind of a highlight of my trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  The environment was spacious and clean.  I ordered #2 on the menu - spicy pork rib noodle soup, small size.  I love the soup base which was not so greasy.  The taste was good.  Just enough spice added to the flavour.  The ribs were tender.  And the noodles were decent texture made from wheat.
Service was good.  The lady took our orders and the dishes came out in good time.  The price including tax came to less than $10.  If you pay by cash, there is a 5% discount.  When we were leaving, both her and the chef personally said goodbye to us.  It was really a lovely and warm gesture."}
{"text":"Nice quiet place, good food. I work close by so I will definitely come back.  The food makes me feel like I am back in China."}
