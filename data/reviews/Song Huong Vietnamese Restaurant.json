{"text":"My favourite place in the city. Best spring rolls in town. Staff is nice and friendly, service is good and prices are also excellent."}
{"text":"Song Huong is a simple and very authentic Vietnamese restaurant. Walking in, my boyfriend and I were the only non Vietnamese customers, which I take as a good thing. We were greeted and seated quickly, and our drinks were out within minutes of ordering. I had the Vietnamese coffee and it was delicious!! Not overly sweet like other restaurants tend to serve it.  I ordered the salad rolls and they also were hands down, the best and freshest rolls I've tasted. We were told they are made to order, never ahead of time and just refrigerated. My boyfriend had a traditional dish which included blood cube. I've never seen blood cubes before and apparently it's a popular item. I can't say I'm a fan, it tasted gelatinous and metallic. But that's just me. I get squeamish about organ meat and blood products. . .  Back to the dish my boyfriend ate, other than the cube, the dish was fantastic. Hunks of pork and tons of veg.  There were quite a few other original dishes that I haven't seen served other places, most including pork, so maybe this isn't your spot if you're not a pig fan, but I'm sold on the salad rolls and coffee alone, and will traverse across the city again to have them."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants! The food is really authentic and they serve some dishes here that I haven't seen at other restaurants.   I have been coming here for years for the bun bo hue. There is always a lot of meat in the bowl and the soup base is delicious. It comes with a mix of sliced vegetables including banana blossom instead of the usual bean sprouts. The pho is delicious as well.  I love the pork and spring roll vermicelli bowl. The charbroiled pork has a lot of flavor and the vermicelli noodles are thinner than other places and the texture is more al dente. The spring rolls I think are made with rice paper which gives it a more unique texture.   I haven't quite acquired the taste for raw beef yet but the dish is really good from all the flavors; the acidity, basil, fried onion/garlic and peanuts.  The shrimp salad rolls are really good here as well because they add some fried garlic and onion to it which adds a lot of flavour and they have some Vietnamese ham inside too.  Remember to bring cash!"}
{"text":"I love pho, and I love to try out new pho restaurants.   I've been to quite a few pho restaurants all over, and this place has the best pho I've ever tried.  Just the most rich, flavourful soup there is.  The raw beef dish is excellent as well."}
{"text":"I love authenticity in this place. I always get bun bo hue and its perfect.  Spices and hebs are exactly how it should be. Service always quick. And prices are cheap compared to other places. Portion sizes are more than enough to satisfy my craving. Family run businesses are where its at. Love this place!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a Vietnamese restaurant close to the airport and this place didn't disappoint.  It's a bit hard to find as it's hidden in a strip plaza but the pho was amazing, the spring rolls authentic (made with rice paper) and the mango smoothie was a hit."}
{"text":"Best bun Bo hue in the city.  Their pho is pretty good too.  I like the fact they have the tapioca dumplings with viet ham or wrapped in banana leaf.  Try to the raw beef salad and bring cash!"}
{"text":"Attention everyone, Song Huong has relocated! New location, same delish Bun Bo Hue!  Be prepared to wait though, it was about a 25 min wait for a table of 2 on a Saturday night.  In addition to the soup, the rice paper spring rolls are a must try!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Not understanding the rave reviews for bun bo hue by others. Broth is way way too sweet and it barely has any of that lovely pungent flavour that bun bo hue must have. Most people think  sweetness=deliciousness. Our brains are wired that way. But if you have sampled this wonderful soup in Vietnam you know that this place is a joke.  wonder if i went on an off day  but the bun bo hue was terrible. Broth tasted very  watered down. The spring rolls though made with rice paper was also bad. Too much moisture inside because too much veggies barely any meat everything pulped into some kind of mush. Yuck."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting too much, visiting from California where Vietnamese food is plentiful. I tried their bun bo hue which was alright but the broth was too sweet. The bun thit nuong cha gio, had lots of veggies but the noodles were too thin and dry. They also don't give you a lot of meat. Their bo tai chanh was frozen, so you had to wait for it to defrost before eating it. Overall, it's okay but maybe it's the best in Calgary."}
{"text":"Tears of joy ! Finally got to try bun bo hue. Now im hooked   Planning to bring my fam there next time.  People r very friendly n place s clean n tidy too."}
{"text":"Favorite Vietnamese place in Calgary. I always, always get the chopped clams on noodles, the rare beef salad and the spring rolls. Worth driving out there!"}
{"text":"My fellow friend and Yelp Elite is bang about this.  I did a double take when I saw the price of their Large Bun Bo Hue was $7. I haven't seen this before. They highlight that this is their specialty. I thought it was ok.  My group went to town on their appetizers: Cha Gio (spring rolls), Banh Bot Loc (clear noodle shrimp and pork dumplings in banana leaf), and Bo Tai Canh (beef tataki). This family do all of them right.  This restaurant is well worth going slightly out of the way from the main 17th Ave area.  I'll have to join Steven N. on his next outing because I too want to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"I come here just for the tapioca dumplings! I didn't like the version with the leaves though, a lot of other people who review seem to though. Just preference I suppose. The leaves version has a lot of tapioca dough, too much for the ratio of filling for my liking in comparison to the little dumplings! SO GOOOOOOD"}
{"text":"The best spring rolls I have ever had and the raw beef salad makes my mouth water just thinking about it."}
{"text":"It's been almost a year since l last ate there. I found out they had reopened in the NE, and l just had to stop by.  For me, I thoroughly missed their chopped clams on rice.  Central Vietnamese fare, and they are famous for their Bun Bo Hue.  But since fell in love with their clams, that's why l got.  They didn't disappoint.  Loved the pungent and smelly fermented shrimp sauce, and the fresh salad with banana blossom. I picked the fresh shrimp salad rolls and they were amazing too.  Fat shrimp, along with a slice of fermented sausage and fried shallot for crunch, it was perfect.   I have had their beef and citrus salad and it was amazing before and l don't doubt it will be again. Next time.    I am happy they are back, and l hope they stay around forever!"}
{"text":"My new favourite Vietnamese place in the city!  I fully creeped out people's Instagram photos prior to going, so I knew what the best dishes to order were, though. The lady at the restaurant even smiled at me knowingly as I confidently named off the items from the menu that I wanted. Wink wink. Yes, this girl knows and loves her multi-ethnic food.   Everything was super!   - The spring rolls were deep fried and a fun snack.   - The raw beef salad was spicy, refreshing and AMAZING. The husband was not sure about ordering raw beef at an asian restaurant in Forest Lawn (which was a perfectly legitimate concern), but I told him that 'NONE OF THE INSTAGRAM PEOPLE got sick, so we will be fine also' :) And I am happy to say no casualties happened after the dinner, so this restaurant passed with flying colours! Yay!   - The Bun Hen was my favourite!! Baby clams with vermicelli in a shrimp paste sauce. So. Good. And SO addictive! I will go back just for that dish.  - A pho soup with lemongrass grilled chicken that I only had one taste of. It was good, but was the weakest of the four dishes.  And did I mention that it was very reasonably priced? In a city like Calgary where eating out costs more and more these days, I find it very rewarding to find great food at a reasonable price.   I don't do baseball, but Song Huong hits a home run for me on all levels: flavour, cleanliness, value and authenticity!"}
{"text":"How many people out there are fully acquainted with Vietnamese food? If you answered yes, how many of you know what Bun Bo Hue is?  From Wikipedia: \"Bun Bo Hue (literally: Hue style beef rice vermicelli) or more specifically, bun bo gio heo (literally: beef and pig's knuckle rice vermicelli) is a popular Vietnamese soup rice vermicelli dish. The predominant flavor is of lemon grass. The broth is sometimes mildly spicy, rarely very spicy, and occasionally not spicy at all.\"  Whether you're Vietnamese and craving this or you want to try something new it is probably safe to assume if it isn't coming from a Vietnamese persons home kitchen you'll probably want to check out Song Huong.  Song Huong provides authentic tasting Bun Bo Hue, this is their specialty and this is what people order probably the most off their menu. I know people from all over the city that travel just to grab a bite at this place.  Decor is mediocre but who needs a fancy looking restaurant when the food itself sells. The location is not too big, about 3 tables on the right side of the restaurant, 4 tables on the left and I do believe two larger ones in the middle to accommodate larger parties.  When you're there grabbing your Bun Bo Hue don't forget to look up the Spring Rolls and order some of those too, I mean, this place has to have the best Spring Rolls in the city! The rice wraps they use there aren't your typical ones that most Vietnamese restaurants use, the type that they use is similar to the ones you will get with Salad Rolls but fried, talk about delicious and authentic tasting!  As well, if you're looking for more appetizers check out the steamed dumplings that they have there -- very tastey and comes with sliced Vietnamese pork as a compliment to the dumplings.  If you're in the area, definitely check this place out --- you might even see me there!"}
{"text":"Reunited, and it feels so good!  I've been waiting for the better part of a year for Song Huong to return and what a return! Their brand new location is clean and bright with lots of extra seating. Best of all, they're still serving up the same great menu.   Their Bun Bo Hue is the best in Calgary. The slightly spicy, sweet, salty, sour broth is soul-satisfying and completely slurp worthy. Ain't no shame in picking up the bowl for those last few dregs. The spring rolls are expertly wrapped with rice paper, making them delightfully crispy yet yielding a perfect chew that typical spring rolls with regular spring roll wrappers can't reproduce. The raw beef salad is so refreshing. The tapioca dumplings are little pockets of wonderfully chewy bursts of flavour.   Everything is still so delicious and service is super fast. For one of the best Vietnamese meals, you can be in-and-out in under an hour and for under $30. Unbeatable!   BEST IN CALGARY pho sho. But maybe don't come here. I really hate waiting.   Reunited, and it feels so good Reunited 'cause we understood There's one perfect fit And, Song Huong, this one is it"}
{"text":"Very good pho. Nice, clean locale. Also great prices. I will probably come back in the future."}
{"text":"Amazing Viet food in Calgary!  Hit the spot on a cold night and worth the drive to this industrial area.  Modern bright decor is a bonus combined with really fresh and tasty pho, real viet style spring rolls, and a viet beef carpaccio in a zesty zingy marinade.  Service is also friendly and that's a nice bonus!"}
{"text":"You know you're making the trek out to Song Huong for one reason, and one reason only.  The BUN BO HUE here is the bomb! And there's no place that can compare to it anywhere else in the city.  I'm in the SW and often drove out to their previous locations on 17th Ave SE and just before 68th St.  Now that they've relocated to the NE just off Barlow and 32nd a bit - it's even better for me.  Plus they now have a debit/credit terminal - no more cash only.  It was embarrassing having to go pull out cash at the 7-11 around the corner before.  Gone are those days :)  XL bowl of Bun Bo Hue, some classic spring rolls (with the rice paper wraps) and the raw beef appetizer is the best.  Note: Parents with babies/toddlers - Song Huong has a separate changing room on top of the typical mens/womens washrooms.  Foldout change table, opposite side is a paper towel dispenser and etc.  Had to use it this past weekend when my daughter had a nuclear bomb of a No. 2 after our meal.  Spent a good 10 minutes cleaning her up.  THANK GOD FOR THIS CHANGING ROOM!  Huge tip for them on this visit.  THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!  I hope other Vietnamese establishments take note of the above.  Song Huong had my business before and continue to do so because of small things like this."}
{"text":"Their bun bo hue is not too bad.  Spring rolls are Northern Vietnam style but lacking a bit of meat.  One of the very few restaurants that has the shrimps and pork tapioca dumpling wrapped in leaves so we go there for that appetizer... good portion to be a meal.  They charged $1.50 for extra small bowl of soup - that was ridiculous.  If they had enough soup in the noodles, I won't have asked for extra soup."}
{"text":"Bún Bò Hu, Mid Vietnamese assorted meats noodle soup. Very authentic taste as Restaurant Owner is from Mid Vietnam. Good clean & simple dining area. Good & fast service. Foods are very delicious. Spring roll made with Rice Paper wrap, the correct way, a bit chewy when cool dow then deep fried. Recommended! !!"}
{"text":"When they were in the 17th ave location, the portions were huge. But ever since they moved to their new location their portion has shrunk by 25%.  Same great taste, but less meat and noodles."}
{"text":"We tried 4 pho places in Calgary. This is the Best one from the four.  Hidden inside industrial park., Signage is a bit hard to see.  Good pricing and very decent food. Lots of fresh garnishes with basil leaf."}
{"text":"I visited this place having high hopes for their bun bo hue. It was quite a disappointment. There was no depth to the broth and the meat was skimpy and thinly sliced. It's been many years since I've had bun bo hue at their previous location, but it was definitely better there.  The service felt disorganized and there was a server there who needs to work on her customer service. Like not giving attitude."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Song Houng again ever since they moved to their new digs. We decided to drop by on Monday for lunch and were seated right away.   The new spot is fresh and a huge upgrade from their previous hole in the wall digs. The place is huge too (there's a second seating area hidden in the back). Service is friendly although we had to remind them about our drinks. Food came out lightning quick!  Menu has changed and is now a simple front and back of appetizers, noodle soups, vermicelli and rice dishes. There's also a small drink menu.   - Ca phe su da ($3.50) - Vietnamese iced coffee. Quite a bit of ice in it but strong.  - Nuoc da trai nhan ($3.50) - longan with crushed ice. Never had this before; awesome. Sweet, refreshing and fresh longans! - Cha gio (#3) ($5.45 for 3 rolls) - sublime. These are hard to find (they make them with rice paper); perfectly crispy, right amount of batter and great filling.  - Banh loc tom thit goi la chuoi (#5) ($7.45) - pork and shrimp tapioca dumplings in banana leaf. Sticky, glutinous goodness. Think you get about 10. - Bun bo hue (#8) ($11.25 extra large) - the BBH is a must. There's a reason it's their signature dish. Great depth of flavour but surprisingly light, clean tasting. The XL is massive.  - Hu tieu do bien kho (#25) ($9.25) - comes with a light, clear broth with a touch of dill. Sauce was a tad too sweet for me but you get a good variety of squid, imitation crab and shrimp.  - Bun hen (#40) ($9.95) - another rare/hard dish to find but this was the best I've had yet. Not too salty.  The only other time I visited Song Huong was before they closed up shop at their original location.  - Cha bio (#3) ($7.45 for 5 rolls) - this is the larger option. Super delicious as always! - Bo tai chant (#6) ($12.95) - there were still half frozen when they came out but the sauce has it all: tangy, acidic, sweet and sour. If the beef had completely thawed out, this dish would have been lights out. - Banh loc tom thit (#4) ($7.45) - another hard to find dish. The pork and shrimp tapioca dumplings had a great chewy, elasticy texture to them. Add a slice of the Vietnamese ham to them and dip into the accompanying fish sauce. - 3x Bun bo hue (#8) ($9.25 large) - almost every single table orders the BBH. Fantastic.  It was great to try more dishes second time around. Song Houng is definitely on my list of places to come back to again and again."}
{"text":"Good authentic choices. They offer a lot of items you don't find at other restaurants. I can't say it's always the freshest, but it will do."}
{"text":"If you're craving some delicious authentic Vietnamese food; this it the spot.  They use the rice paper for the spring rolls which is the style of spring rolls I prefer ( me and my husband always share the large order). They have a very tasty bo tai chanh which is raw beef with a citrus sauce.  It might be weird at first but its really just a vietnamese version of beef tartare.  I really enjoy the bun hen which is rice vermicelli with sate clams. Its just so flavourful."}
{"text":"At a reasonable price for the Bun Bo Hue between the large and extra large, you can't go wrong with the extra large! The broth is fantastic! (Was bland once) but if you're looking for an appetizer, get the spring rolls!! (Not the salad roll) they use rice paper its teas of the usual spring roll paper but you'd be crazy to hate it!!"}
{"text":"If you follow me you know I have an affinity for noodles (ok just pretty much any kind of food but who's asking). Whether its fat noodles, skinny noodles, white noodles, yellow noodles, I just love them all. Why does that make it relevant to this post you might ask? Well, let me tell you about this magical fat, slurpy white noodle dish Song Huong specializes in called bun bo hue. A perfect balance of salty, sour, sweet and spicy with the scent of lemongrass, this beef soup is complimented by the the previously mentioned white noodles, an assortment of meats and chopped greens. Hearty and delicious, I have yet to find a place which does it as good as Song Huong.    Plus, they even offer rice paper spring rolls (salad roll wrapper type deep fried shell which very few places do) and a wicked Vietnamese raw beef salad. Sounds strange but it's SO good - almost like a Vietnamese tartar marinated with onions, lime juice, chili's and topped with fried garlic and crushed peanuts.  I should mention this post is based only on the above three items. I've yet to try anything else and decor/ambiance doesn't count because it's pho and when  you're nose deep in broth, that doesn't matter."}
{"text":"Craving an extremely large hot piping bowl of Bun Bo Hue?   You've come to the right place my friend. Song Huong is a bit far out in the ghetto, but if you don't mind the adventure, the Bun Bo Hue here is bomb-diggity.  The regular size is $7 something but XL is $10 something. Go for the XL, you won't regret it.   I didn't get a chance to try the other pho or vermicelli dishes so can't really comment on those dishes. Will update this review accordingly when that happens.    4 stars. 4 big ones!"}
{"text":"Came across Song Huong in a food blog/yelp binge last night and so we trekked over today for dinner. It's cash only, but there's a 7-11 in the same complex so that shouldn't be a problem.  I was very excited about the rare beef salad. It's a Vietnamese carpaccio and it is such a delight. Crunchy minced peanuts, red chile's, cilantro, lime, shaved onion and sweet vinegar dance while the cool and tender beef melts in your mouth.  An absolute standout and something that will keep bringing me back again and again. The portion is extremely generous for $12.50, so if you can't share it, you may only need some spring/salad rolls. No digestion problems either, for those concerned.  The boy ordered the lemongrass chicken vermicelli soup. The broth had that exotic magic of sweet, salty and creamy while still being clear. Perhaps a little too salty after hot sauce was added and cuts of chicken could be a little better, but overall really tasty.  I had the Bun Bo Hue everyone keeps raving about. My unfamiliarity with this dish meant it didn't resonate with fond memories, which I think may be necessary since it wasn't anything special to me. Tried the blood cube. Not my thing, but I'm guessing this is part of the appeal. For those who are trying this the first time, it's a cheap enough mistake to see if you like it ($8 for the regular bowl).  Across the board, the prices are the most reasonable you'll find and the food is worth the trip, even if they were inflated.   Decor is cute. Green walls, faux flowers and lights with a little grass hut for the till."}
{"text":"Ended up here on a Saturday evening , I liked the room, the food ... and the pricing ! I ordered a Lemmon Grass Vermicelli( exhibit A ) please notice how fresh and crunchy the spring rolls are."}
{"text":"Super love the pork & shrimp tapioca dumplings steamed in banana leaves! It's number 51 on the menu. But once in a while you will find some of them do not have shrimps.   Remember, number 50 and 51 are different; not only because number 50 has Vietnamese ham & no banana leaves, but the textures of the dumplings are not same!  The Bun Bo Hue is good too, but it's a bit spicy for me.  Hours: Sunday to Saturday 10am - 9pm , except Tuesday (Closed)"}
{"text":"Not all pho are created equal. Vietnam is a large country with distinct styles depending on the region. When I want something from the Hue region, this is the restaurant I come to.   Hue is the former Nguyen royal capital of Vietnam from the early 19th century until 1945. Bun bo Hue is a popular dish from Hue. I highly recommend it. It is unlike any other Vietnamese noodle soup that you may have had.   Other items that are must orders: Raw beef salad (I know someone that just orders two of these for dinner) Spring rolls (unique due to their use of wonton crepes) Tapioca dumplings"}
{"text":"Apparently this place is the best place for BBH in the #yyc. So good that when I went there, there were already some Edmontonian peeps eating there. So that's a good sign, i guess. The Bo Tai Chanh and Viet Spring Rolls we had for apps. They were pretty dope. Bo Tai Chanch is just slices of raw beef served cold. Doesn't sound good but it's really good, some pieces were icy and that was pretty cool, like drinking a slurpee, but with meat, a meat slurpee. Viet spring rolls which the vietnamese name for it is so long that i refuse to type it, was good. It's actually really good anywhere you order it. The BBH here is really tasty and really cheap, and that's king in my books. It had slices of beef shank, vietnamese ham, with rice noodles. Mmmmmpf. So dope, but could only bite the blood cube a couple times before i just gave it to Ben.  Place is small and fairly clean. Located next to a 7-11 for slurpess to wash out some traces of blood cube in my mouth. Tasty and cheap.  Sal says: Just try it"}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese restaurant in the city. The pho is delicious and the broth is always hot and flavourful. You can also order an extra large for any pho. I enjoyed the Bun Bo Hue and the blood cubes were not overpowering. The rice dishes are also delicious.   The location is hard to find, but it's the only place in a commercial plaza that's constant packed in the city."}
{"text":"Quick and Friendly Service!! Great selection of pho and the spring rolls are amazingly delicious!! The best I've ever had. Gf took me out for lunch yesterday and going back again today just for the spring rolls   Highly recommend this restaurant for all you Pho lovers out there. Location was a bit hard to find as it's hidden in a corner on 19th street NE but worth the commute!!"}
{"text":"The speciality of the house are: bun bo hue which is a spicy pork broth noodle with sliced beef and #51 banh loc tom thit goi la chuoi which is a tapioca dumpling filled with shrimp and ground pork and steamed in banana leaves. #51 is why I am here at this place - it's an appetizer dish that you dip into fish sauce. The tapioca dumpling is translucent, slightly fragrant from the banana leaves and has a chewy texture. The taste is subtly sweet and balanced with the savoury flavours of the fillings and finally with the saltiness of the fish sauce. So good. You can't eat too much as it is quite filling. A real Vietnamese speciality treat whenever I am in Calgary.   The Vietnamese spring rolls are also another must try.   The pho tai was ok - I didn't love the broth but they sliced beef was good. I am picking about pho broths. Stick to the specialties of the house.   It's a true Vietnamese clientele. People who run the place speaks English. Place is clean and decor is typical of most traditional Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"As authentic as Vietnamese Food gets in Calgary. The food here is truly special and you feel you are dining somewhere in Vietnam. You won't regret the foodie experience here."}
