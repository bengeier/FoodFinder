{"text":"Two breakfasts with two different outcomes.   Went on a Thursday morning for a light breakfast of fruit, and vitality bowl and it was great! Plenty of fresh fruit. My hubby raced over vitality bowl. Coffee was very weak however. We were greeted and served quickly and it was all good.   Today- a different story! Sat outside ignored for quite awhile. We finally asked if someone would help us. People next to us had to do the same thing! There were a lot of servers but it didn't seem like anyone was serving particular tables so it was kind of a free for all! People had to beg to be waited on and then suddenly we had 3 different waiters asking to take our orders! Bad planning!  Food was just ok. Eggs were a bit mushy and watery. Lots of nearby restaurants that I would go to on a weekend from now on. They seemed overwhelmed or something."}
{"text":"Horrible experience -I wish I could give it  negative stars!! So as guest of the hotel we decided to have Sunday breakfast there -it was not crowded and it looked like the food would be good. So we get seated and the person seating us said if you doing breakfast buffet go ahead and get started and we told her that we did not want the buffet we wanted to order off the menu and she was like oh and attitude completely changed. So then we waited about 15 to 20 minutes to even get a waiter to come over and bring us water. We try to place our order but the waiter spoke very poor english so we fumbled thru that. Ok so we are waiting and waiting and the waiter never once comes back over to see if we need anything or to refill our water or coffee. finally had to get up and go to buffet just to get some more water and coffee. Finally after 35-40 minutes we thought WTH and I went over to then only waitress I saw out on the floor and said we are going to leave since we had no service food or water and she states oh wait I will go check on your food i am sure it is done. Before I can make my way back across the restaurant to our table our food is being delivered to the table-hmmm that was fast so our food must of been just sitting there if you are able to walk it to our table before I can even get to the table. So we look at the food as the waitress and the manager are serving the food and all of us state that our food is stone cold and gross and congealed -the manager states no it is not I just took it off the grill  myself. So friend at the table sticks her finger into her breakfast skillet (as we are all sticking our fingers into our own food to see just how warm the manager trying to lie about how warm the food is) and she states to manager if this just came off the grill then why is there no steam heat and I can put my whole hand into this mess. My french toast was so cold it was disgusting. My other friends eggs were a cold hard congealed mess. We stated to the manager once again look all the food is cold and not hot off the grill and we have been waiting this whole time. He just said no it is not and walked away. We just go up from the table and found the only waitress again on the floor and said we can not eat that mess and left hungry tired and frustated. The poor service was extremely uncalled for and there was no excuse as they were not busy at that time even though other employees were setting up for a private event. So maybe if you are a private event you may get better service but I dont know since there was no one even there for the private event at that time.  The worst part was to have a manager lie to our face but then to have him just walk away and completely ignore us was the worst insult to a customer."}
