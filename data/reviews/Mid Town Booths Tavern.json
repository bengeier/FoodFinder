{"text":"The patio is awesome but the bartender blatantly ignored me twice to walk passed me to help guys that walked up to the bar after me. She spent more time flirting with them than even acknowledging me, nothing, just kept walking passed me until there was only me.  This happened to me two of the three times I went there with different bartenders. Overall place is nice, nothing special, but the patio is one of the nicer ones in lakewood."}
{"text":"Like trivia?? Go see one of the smartest people I know host trivia Monday night at Booth's!  Win free pitchers of beer, gift cards and, of course, Rich Trivia Cozies'! The gals behind the bar are great; it's a local-bar feel where you walk in and people know you by name... I still think of Booth's as The Drink; either way, stop in... you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The first (and last) time i came here, could not get the bartenders attention to save my life-. Rude & bad staff"}
{"text":"We went for wing night and happy hour on Wednesday night. The wings were excellent and the pepper jack cheese curds were good.

The only thing  was only one girl was running the bar and didn't have a clue and was charging everyone incorrectly. She would say the specials but ring you up full price. At this point we should of just walked out.
She didn't know the  $5 wing night special and she stated happy hour was $1.50 domestic beers but charged us $4.00 per beer and regular price for wings. First time we went for happy hour and wing night and the bar tender was clueless. She rang our card three times and still got it wrong. The scary thing was, when we were leaving she was training another bartender. 

Go after 8 they have way better bartenders, and better service. First time we ever had a problem here"}
{"text":"Good people, really great location, tasty food and a relaxed atmosphere. I don't make it over often enough but am happy every time I do."}
{"text":"Fun dive bar that is good for watching games and hanging out. Always an easy bar to walk into and not feel like an outcast. Like this place a lot!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 drinks and the bartender lost my husband's credit card. Too much of a liability to ever go back, unfortunately. If you have cash, get the pulled chicken."}
{"text":"So far, I have only ever had an enjoyable time at this bar. The food is solid - fairly standard bar food but better than average. They have a nice beer selection and friendly staff. I like the decor a lot and usually find the crowd pretty nice, as well."}
{"text":"Bartenders aren't always the greatest, however, the food makes up for the lack of service. Cheap, fast, and delicious! Beer is cheep. Craft beer out of the fridge is usually $4 with a great selection."}
{"text":"I love Booths. The food is some of the best Lakewood has to offer. I love the pepper jack cheese bites and the peanut butter burger. The latter sounds weird but I would definitely recommend.

The only bad thing is the service at times. They are always friendly but it can take way too long to get served even when it's not very busy."}
{"text":"My review has nothing to do with the food.  I wasn't able to try the food.  The service was horrible!!  The Bartenders would look right at you, then ignore you, as She and the other bartender did shots.  I was sitting at the bar for 2 1/2 hrs and was served only 2x.  It was a little busy, but nothing that 3 bartenders couldn't handle.  So we ended up going to the Rush Inn and got served right away, even though they had more customers."}
{"text":"This place is the worst shit hole bar I have ever went to in my life. Service is awful. We ordered food and waited an hr to find out they didn't even have the ingredients for items we ordered. No one even spoke to us about it they just ignored us. The staff are a bunch of drunk assholes. Exempt for Shannon she at least told us what was going on and refunded our money. Overall if you want to go to a bar and never get served then come to this shit shack"}
{"text":"Feels like a family holiday gathering every time we go. Staff always greet us like favorites. We order salads and burgers for eat in or take out at least once a week.  My older \"kids\" love playing Cards with Rich on Thursdays!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and had an awesome time at each visit. Never ordered food but friends at both visits said it was quality bar food. Nothing fancy but cooked well and fresh for what it was. I love the lighting and he long bar. Specifically, the patio is great here! Will definitely go back! Drinks were made timely and service was quick."}
{"text":"You want to experience a classic bar with a modern staff?  Booth's has fun staff and vast selection of liquid refreshment. The menu is bar usual with a few mixes of excitement.

The major draw for me is ordering a Mason Jar of my favorite beer!  You can also bring a stein from home to drink from and they'll stash it on a hook behind the bar for you!  Got an old toy/bobble head/tacky decoration?  Bring it in and if it's cool enough they'll add it to the bar's motif."}
{"text":"Feel like I'm home here. Always a great time. Nina is the best bartender! Tip her well. Great menu choices as well"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! Food was very good and well priced. Great outdoor patio and back bar. Good spot to meet friends of possible love interest."}
{"text":"This place totally suprised me!  Came in during wing crawl.  I had been here years ago when it had another name.  I just lumped it in with all the Bud Lt chugging tool bars (McCarthys and Johnny Malloys) so I never came back.  The decor is cool..lotsa random, cool stuff up on shelves to look at!  I like thats its not trying to be all hip and sleek (barf).  The dude back by the wing station said he did all the art hanging on the walls.  One was a bunch of beer labels..right up my alley!  The wings were good too!  I deffinately will stop back for a happy hour or somethin!"}
{"text":"Big fan of Booth's, a nicer-than-most dive bar with plenty of seating & a great patio area when the weather's nice (though the TV set-up is less than ideal out there). Drinks are inexpensive, the bartenders are friendly & attentive, & the clientele is varied, from local bros to weird townies. It's a great place to catch a game & bask in that Cleveland sports rush, good or bad."}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday afternoon. I really enjoyed the back patio area, looks like it was recently done.The bartender was very friendly helping us out. We ordered a batch of the pepper jack cheese bites which were amazing. Then ordered our food, and it came in a very timely manner I got the pizza sub and my buddies got some burgers. After we were done the cook came out and asked us how everything was which you don't see very often. 

Definitely going back and would recommend it to people looking for grab some drinks and good food."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the 4th and it wasn't too busy, so not sure if this is the typical atmosphere. But definitely seems to be a good place to go if you want a low key bar to go to and just have a drink with friends. They didn't seem to have much of what we were looking to drink, I'm not sure if that was this bar, or if its a Cleveland thing. Being from Wisconsin with were just looking for Southern Comfort. But, the bar tender was very friendly and she made suggestions that were just as good. We came later in the day so the kitchen was closed, but will have to stop back to try the food. Again, not sure if this is just a Cleveland thing and I'm not use to the cheaper drink prices, but our tab was CHEAP for everything we got. So definitely worth the trip if you just want a cost effective, low-key night out."}
