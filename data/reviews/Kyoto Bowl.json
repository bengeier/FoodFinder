{"text":"Had the Chicken Teriyaki. It was awful. No flavor, the chicken was fatty. Took two bites and threw it in the trash. It was so bad I was fearful of food poisoning. Just didn't seem fresh. The one star is because I had to give it a star to even write this. For $10 I would rather have Chipotle."}
{"text":"This place is nasty, the spring roll tasted liked it had been frozen for 50 years.  The  beef broccoli tasted like  dead cats.  The shrimp was stinky, like it was not washed, the chicken strips were tiny and had no flavor at all."}
{"text":"I've only been to this place twice before and due to this kiddo in my belly I was really craving a teriyaki bowl. After driving quite a distance I order a chicken teriyaki bowl to go only to get home and find the chicken was clearly pink. Called to let them know and was offered a discount on my next visit. Really? I paid 7 bucks for a meal I couldn't even touch and I'm so lucky to get a discount. Clearly will not return."}
{"text":"Good food.  Ate there today and I like that the dishes are not overly sauced yet sauced enough for you to enjoy the taste of the meats and the sauce.  It's a bit pricey for the portion you receive.  I would frequent it more should the prices be a bit more reasonable say about a buck less for teriyaki chicken.  Should you go for the combo with the drink, two entrees will run over $16.00.  Don't get me wrong the portion is a pretty good and it is cooked right when you place your order.   It is just that you can get more for less elsewhere -- though some cheaper establishments are not nearly as tasty."}
{"text":"Ordered the teriyaki chicken. Every aspect was subpar. Chicken wasn't good. Rice wasn't good. Tasted like a frozen teriyaki chicken dinner. 

And to add to that, it was expensive. Costed more than my usual spots like chipotle, etc."}
{"text":"I thought I would try out this place because it is next door to my work. The food quality and the atmosphere reminded me of eating in my high school or college cafeteria = Nothing worthwhile. My rice was clumpy and extra chewy. The sauce on my chicken had an abundance of salt. I needed 3+ glasses of water to wash down all the salt. The location is prime = next door to a Starbucks, McDonald's, subway and a LA fitness. The restaurant needs to be completely remodeled and also needs a fresh new heathy fresh menu ... then it would become a very successful restaurant."}
{"text":"I have eaten here two times before no problems but last night makes me done. I have was eating a teriyaki bowl with brown rice and found not one but two hairs in my food. I will not be coming back"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place stays open.  The food is horrible.  I paid approximately $8.00 for nothing but brown rice.  Chicken was old.  I essentially put $8.00 dollars in trash can."}
{"text":"One star is being nice.  This place has deteriorated more and more over the years, but today, the food was simply disgusting.  Yak isobar was not edible, smelled like vomit.  Dark meat with gristle and chunks of fat, and sweet and sour chicken soaked in oil and not even slightly crispy.  The place is dirty and the bathroom is filthy and stinks terribly.  I doubt this place is owned by the same people it once was....it is unacceptable.  Don't waste your time, money or appetite.  They do not deserve to stay in business.  I am only being honest and not trying to be cruel.  I hope they clean up their act, but it's hard to imagine at this point."}
{"text":"This is a frequent lunch spot for me, either to hang out with a good book or take it to go and eat at my desk. My favorite item is the Spicy Teriyaki Chicken bowl with brown rice. It's plenty hot (both in temp and spice), the chicken is moist and there's more than enough sauce to thoroughly mix with the rice. The place is always clean and there's usually a decent but not overwhelming crowd."}
{"text":"Walk inside to see hear Spanish music, see quite a few Spanish magazines and TV guides laying around and the cashier spoke very broken English but could speak Spanish. Kind of an odd way to put together a Japanese food establishment in my opinion but I ordered anyway.

I got a chicken teriyaki bowl, a california roll, and crab puffs. The chicken teriyaki bowl was the only thing that I could actually eat. The california rolls were about an inch across and took four bites to eat and even then were dry, bland and was 90% rice. Sushi is supposed to be bite sized. The crab puffs were large but the filling was just horrible. It tasted like they had sat in the freezer for a month before they fried them using old oil.

Overall the prices are high for what you get, the food is pretty horrible, and the service is meh. The cashier had to point to my total because he couldn't say it in English. I won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Love Kyoto Bowl's teriyaki chicken and other dishes! Sad that some of their other locations have closed."}
{"text":"I've had Danker"}
{"text":"This place serves a poor excuse for japanese food. I dont understand how they keep their doors open with the product they serve. Nothing on the menu is worth trying. 

The man behind the counter is unfriendly and gave me a annoyed look when i asked for wasabi."}
{"text":"After a two year hiatus I relented and thought I'd give this place a try again.  Big mistake.
Repugnant, repulsive and repellent.  And now lets review the food.  A bowl of indeterminate slop co-mingling with a bit of detritus. Yes, I mean the teriyaki chicken bowl. 

I am actually angry at myself for going here and giving them $$.   After you pass through the front glass doors with their patina of dirt and grease you start to rationalize that it will all be ok...just keep moving forward and don't look at anything too long or think too hard about the food.  Sure it smells funky...but that's probably just a new kind of eco friendly cleaner that, oddly enough, smells like old tennis shoes.  Or something.  So you place your order and wait....and hope.  In my case I \"hoped\" really hard because even though I tried to distract myself from the sights and smells...I couldn't.  The place smelled bad and was unctuous.

Ok...so took the food home, opened the lid and there it was.  Slop is great description because it was a soupy amalgam of rice and chicken parts submerged in \"sauce\" or whatever it is called.  Terrible.  Disappointing.  Frustrating.  What a waste of time, effort and money.

Don't the owners care?  At all?    

I will never go here again."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese I've ever had. Hands down. 

Place is disgusting too."}
{"text":"Today was the last time I go here. The food and service have been less then mediocre. As if the go out of there way to show that your just another customer. I kept hoping that it was a fluke so I spaced out my visits to rule out. It has been proven now his is just how they are. Oh and ask for something fresh or even slightly different then what's on menu.... Just be warned the don't like that either, heaven forbid you get something the way you like it."}
{"text":"Feeling over paid for rice and a bite of size amount of salad. Looked nice inside. Was with friends and having a good time so, the focus was not all on the food. The food tasted ok/good.  They say they have wifi? Could not use it. It was impossible to connect to the Wi-Fi. They could not help with the problem. No wifi and imho over priced."}
{"text":"Love Kyoto Bowl! Good teriyaki chicken, very good egg rolls, and a solid selection of other entrees. They are fast and offer to- go orders here, and don't charge for changing to brown rice, etc. For a good, fast meal, it's not a bad choice"}
{"text":"I got the chicken teriyaki bowl. It was the most discusting thing I've had in a while. The brown rice tasted stale. The chicken tasted microwaved. The teriyaki sauce tasted like corn syrup. Never again."}
{"text":"Lately it seems their standards have gone down. The chicken is dry when I order white meat. If im paying extra I would expect better tasting food."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch my food was ready in less than 4 minutes! Which Is awesome in my opinion . Teriyaki bowl was yummy and the potstickers were ahh a bit dry not so great . Anyhow this place is very clean and very quiet! Great choice for lunch today!"}
{"text":"Was out of town for business and decided to try this place out... bad decision.  I'm surprised they're still in business.  I should have done my research but basically, this place sucks.  The food was terrible and extremely bland.  For the price, I expected more quality dishes.  You're better off going to Pick Up Stix (if they have it in AZ) or some type of Asian buffet.

Edit:  This placed closed down, and rightfully so."}
{"text":"Wish I'd yelped before agreeing to eat here! Pseudo Japanese \"food\" made with generic, untasty ingredients. Be prepared to use a LOT of soy sauce."}
{"text":"Went here last Wednesday and I was going to leave it alone but when you get to pay for a meal that is that disappointing you feel obligated to share the experience. I got the #1 combo meal and the lemonade was the best part of the meal. The chicken though drenched in sauce was dry as I've ever had and the rice was well rice nothing more or less. And what the hell was that roll? Not an egg roll although it called itself an egg roll it was flat disgusting. I should have known better when we rolled up and we're the only ones in the place when we got there. We were also the only ones there when we left now I know why. Don't you people waist your time here."}
{"text":"How is this joint still in business? I don't get it. Out of the whole, \"I'm going to try something new\" I ventured in here some weeks ago and am now dead-set against setting my foot in any place ending in \"Bowl.\"

I asked for the spicy teriyaki chicken special. What I got was dark meat chicken in catfood-sized bits smothered in lazy overly sweet goop on top of a gelatinous heap of rice. Spicy? Maybe for Grandma Ethel.

The place was depressing to eat at. I looked across 20th Street, and there was Trader Joe's laughing at me. Hell, even Arby's was laughing at me.

Not a good sign and a sad day for Japanese food.

1 star."}
{"text":"Just went there to try out a new place for lunch. I am so dissapointed. Right off the bat the man taking my order was super rude and uninvolved. I asked to replace the egg roll in my meal with edemame instead and right away he said \"no, we don't have edemame.\" I asked him why was it on the menu and in one of the pictures, and he corrected himself and made the switch. Then he answered the phone and started taking another order over the phone rather than putting them on a brief hold while finishing up my order. He just threw my recipt at me and I HAD TO ASK if it needed to be signed. He was done with me the second I asked to switch to edemame. Terrible and never going back."}
{"text":"This was and experience.  First off the place was dead, which should have been an indicator for us to leave.  The employee who took our order was extremely monotone.  I ordered a yakisobe (if thats how you spell it) and my friend ordered a beef teriyaki bowl.  My plate was basically all vegetables, little to no noodles.  The chicken was mostly gristle and the entire dish was very bland.  My friend's plate was also very bland.  He felt that the rice to beef ratio was extremely off.  It was a tad under $20 total for the both of us.  We wish we would have stuck to a something more typical or had made a sandwich at home.  I havent the slightest of ideas as to how this place is still open.  Trust me if you are thinking of eating here you should just go to costco and buy some of those microwaveable teriyaki bowls.  You get like 8 for $15 and they are a billion times better.  This place made Panda Express seem like fine dinning."}
{"text":"I used to frequent Kyoto Bowl when it was in Gilbert. I have missed it since in closed many years ago. As I was in Tempe recently, I saw a Kyoto bowl calling my name. After I ate there, I should have passed on the invitation. The food was hot, but that is all I could say about it. There was absolutely no flavor to the teriyaki sauce. The sweet and sour was more like thick orange colored water. Also no flavor. I was terribly disappointed. So sorry Kyoto bowl -  never again. . ."}
{"text":"Food is good. Decor is outdated. Fish tank is empty. Clean. Never a line. I come because it's close to work, great price, good food, in and out, but i wouldn't want to hang out."}
{"text":"Best Japanese food reminds me a lot of when I used to live in California there teriyaki chicken improved a lot i love coming here there prices have also dropped and are know giving more food for a cheaper price"}
{"text":"looks dirty and my simple to make teriyaki chicken bowl was drowned in the watered down sauce, but I was HUNGRY. So I ate it. mid way through I almost choked on a very sharp chicken bone and all for the low price of almost ten bucks for a bowl and small drink? The staff can barely speak English... dont think I will return."}
{"text":"It was between this and subway for me and my bf. Since we have never eaten here before, we decided to check it out. I got the Orange chicken managers special and he got the hot and spicy. There wasn't much chicken in mine and his was just spice and no flavor. It was okay but not worth the 19.54$ total. Should've went to subway :/"}
{"text":"If you like your service poor and your food with hair cooked in it, you've found the right place. Nummy!

I let the hair thing go ONCE. After all it's not as bad as MY cooking, but the second time it happened I let them know they had permanently lost my business. 

Their food is below greasy spoon quality as they do things to meat (at least I THINK it's meat) that are unholy. Like cooking their hair in your food and using salt by the pound on any dish. 

I used to love Kyoto bowl back in the nineties, but  I can see why so many of them are closing now. Bad food, bad service. Steer clear."}
{"text":"Wanting something other than a sandwich I stopped in. I got a chicken teriyaki bowl with white chicken. The chicken tasted bland and manufactured. A few pieces were also a bit fatty. The sauce was good but not good enough to save the meal. Thumbs down."}
{"text":"I really like this place and don't understand why it's empty most of the time.  The food is always served piping hot and quite yummy.  Sadly, all items are a dollar too much in my opinion (coming from Los Angeles). I'd go here much more often if it was more affordable. The toppings might be a tad skimpy for an average American... (eg. not enough meat), although I manage to eat proportionally."}
{"text":"We love Kyoto bowl and have been going for over 20 years. I love the oyoko chicken white meat and the creamy dressing....so glad there are a few left in the valley!"}
{"text":"Food tastes horrible, not authentic and no flavor. I don't know how they manage to stay in business...every time I pass by the place is completely empty..."}
{"text":"Always a fav for fast food!! I been going to various locations and this isn't anything more but easy fast and yummy!"}
{"text":"Shame on me for not reading Yelp reviews before walking in. I saw the sign and craved Japanese. I asked my server for his top 2 recommendations. He sad the chicken teriyaki combo and the House chicken combo. 

Chicken teriyaki was overly sweet and starchy. The rice was mushy and overcooked. The egg roll was tasteless.

The house chicken was a little better. The pickled veggies was the highlight of the meal. The sushi was okay, not made with sushi rice. The chicken was okay. The server was nice enough but doesn't have the product to back him up."}
{"text":"Dear Sh*tty Tempe Kyoto Bowl Employee,
Why are you SUCH a d*ck? I'm soooooo nice to you and you always make me regret it. I want to say something to point out what a rude piece of sh*t you are, but I fear you'll do something to my food. Instead, I say nothing and drive all the way home muttering things under my breath as I feel like the world's biggest p*ssy for not calling you out on what a d*ck you are. Instead, I'm forced to go home and write a really lame FB status update that you'll never read just so I can get it out of my system. Aaaaaaaaagh!
Sincerely,
Wussy McWussterton 
P.S. I hope you have a lovely Thanksgiving with your family. I'm sorry about what I said just moments ago. Please don't sh*t in my food."}
{"text":"Ok, so I realize that i'm giving 4 stars to a quick spot but the 4 stars are for the taste of the food and based on their category of alike businesses!

I absolutely love Kyoto Bowl and get dinner here sometimes once a week when my husband is traveling or definitely once every two weeks. It is a great healthy option when not wanting to cook! I always get the same thing, their Sukiyaki Beef with a green salad + ginger dressing. The flavors are incredible and you're literally in and out under $10 with a delicious, pretty healthy meal! They have a ton of other options including sushi, teriyaki chicken, noodle bowls, etc. It has been in this location since I was a child so that says something! 

Thank you for encouraging my laziness, Kyoto Bowl! :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Kyoto Bow and I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the #6 combo (Yakisoba bowl with side salad and a drink) which cost about $10. The bowl was flavorful and didn't require any additional sauce to combat dryness. The wait was about 10 minutes to receive our food after we ordered leading me to believe that the food is cooked to order rather than sitting prepared under heat lamps. Overall it was a good experience. Possibly a little pricier than I would have expected to pay, so I'm not sure it will be an everyday \"go-to\" spot, but will likely be back."}
{"text":"It was foolish of me to not read Yelp before I wasted $10 here! Ordered 2 4-piece \"California rolls.\"

Strike 1: These weren't even the typical kind I find at most restaurants. They tasted pre-made and refrigerated. Very dry and flavorless!

Strike 2: The guy behind the counter had a \"whatever\" attitude.

Strike 3: It was hot outside and I didn't feel any air conditioning running. There's just one ceiling fan moving in the dining area and the front door is wide open allowing flies to come in.

This place has was empty when I walked in ... And I don't wonder why now!

Ask me if you think I'm going to come back. :-/"}
{"text":"this guys are Mexican and they want to make a Japanese meal like really stay on them tacos bro shiit!!!"}
{"text":"Was craving Japanese food and stopped by Kyoto Bowl. Ordered beef and chicken bowl and wasn't to happy with the food. It was bland would come back"}
{"text":"Don't order the vegetarian bowl. It Didn't taste good. Maybe I should've tried the teriyaki dish which others have been giving good reviews."}
{"text":"Have been coming to this place since i was a kid. Extremely ordinary, but great tasting chicken teriyaki."}
{"text":"Wow, this food is absolutely terrible. Teriyaki sauce has zero flavor. The chicken is the generic dark rib meat, really cheap product. Veggies are from a can so the mushrooms and bamboo shoots are very slimy. I will not be returning until I'm 90 years of age because that's what this place is designed to cater to."}
{"text":"Good food but the place is puzzling. Why so empty? The food when it's served could be hotter but I can't complain. I Iike the calorie count chart on the wall, I DONT like the way when I asked about it, the young lady behind the counter served a little bit of attitude. All in all I'm satisfied."}
{"text":"I can't really hate on the place. I come here usually once a week when working nearby. The place is indeed not very inviting, will make you feel like you're the only one who has eaten there all week and nothing fancy but if you have fond memories of all the Kyoto Bowls the valley used to have a few years ago at least the food will be familiar (and the decor too sadly. I'll call it \"nostalgic\"). I swear by the Oyako bowl (chicken sauteed and then cooked in a Japanese broth, and then finished with egg and served over rice), the only item I ever get and I'm sure the Chicken Teriyaki isn't bad either. Just realize it's not fancy, not amazing but better than most fast foods for sure."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, there is no 0 star option.
I had to write this review quickly in case I die of e-coli. 

The ONLY item I had that did not cause me to gag was the inari sushi (fried bean curd shell stuffed with rice).
The bowl I ordered was absolutely the worst I have EVER had. EVER.
The California rolls despicable.

The meat was dry. No hint a moisture or flavor. Based on the flavor, I wonder if it was even chicken. Seriously, it sucked the moisture out of my mouth when I \"tried\" to eat it.
The vegetables had flavor, but not a good flavor. Spoiled cabbage comes to mind. I think they cooked it last week. Out of $20 of food I at the Inari and tossed everything else.(Almost \"tossed\" what I did eat.

The california rolls must have been made three days ago. The rice had dried out into a solid clump of gross surrounding some rotting celery, dry artificial crab meat and avocado wrapped is smelly nori. 

Shame shame shame shame on Kyoto Bowl!!!!

Oh, it was VERY clean in the lobby...because NO-ONE comes in to mess it up.

Ef this place!"}
{"text":"I worked near there a couple years ago and would blindly walk in there on my lunch breaks over and over, ignorantly forgetting how mediocre the food was.  But I recently saw a Stixx has opening near there, so I don't even know if they are still in business..."}
{"text":"The guy working was such a nice guy. My boyfriend and I got chicken teriyaki bowls. Delicious. Especially for the price. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Remember in the 90s when Kyoto Bowl was good and you could page your friend, he'd call you and you could ask him to stop by the Blockbuster to pick up Terminator II swing by the Kyoto Bowl and grab you a Teriyaki Bowl?  

Then that dude stole your girlfriend, you got an iPhone, Blockbuster closes virtually every store around, and Kyoto Bowl started serving awful food that smells like bile in a bowl.  

At least you still have Terminator II.....now on DVD with bonus features.  

If you're tempted to re-live the 90's at the Kyoto Bowl, just play some Pearl Jam and grow your goatee out instead.  You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"The only decent thing on the menu is the salmon but even that is average at best. Avoid if you can. The place looks dingy, the staff looks surly, and the edamame is limp... I don't see the point of this place."}
{"text":"seriously, how hard is it to make a decent fast food teryaki chicken bowl? and marble sized shumai?  what in the world?  if you're totally destitute and you can't find any other restaurant to spend your last dime on, then go ahead, you have been forewarned.

how do they stay in business is my question"}
{"text":"dee-skusting!  ate here once, the food was horrible, portions were microscopic.

try it if you don't believe.

don't tell me i didn't warn you

save your hard earned cash for another place and time"}
{"text":"I was trying to be healthy and  ordered a vegetable bowl with brown rice. It was very bland. I could have just coooked some brown rice and microwaved some plain veggies and saved the $6.00. 

As for service, I was in the middle of the line to order and mine was the last to come out. It was just me and my order was simple, compared to the meat dishes ordered ny the other customers. Which looked way better than what I ordered.

I probably won't go back since it not near my house, I really just tried it because it was on my way."}
{"text":"Was craving teriyaki... had to go somewhere else... Kyoto Bowl is closed."}
{"text":"Old and nasty egg roll tasted horrible . And the teriyaki sauce was gooey. Very Bland no flavor way overpriced not happy at all ................."}
{"text":"I remember going where when I was little around 10-15 years ago. It has not changed (menus the same and same with the decor) some would say it is a bad thing that they haven't changed. In my opinion, it is still as great as I remembered it. I love the house chicken here. The decor is very nostalgic to me,  but I see why some people would want them to renovate. All in all this place is still a stop I go to when in the area and it is worth a shot if you are wanting a good rice bowl!"}
{"text":"This place is awful! Never had chicken teriyaki soup before. I feel like I'm gonna puke! The soggy egg roll tasted like an old refrigerator. Stay away!"}
{"text":"I keep wanting this place to be what it used to be, and keep getting disappointed. There is no other term to describe the $10 yakisoba bowl I received, other than disrespectful. 
    The \"all white\" option I ordered were mostly sawdust size scraps, and large ugly chunks of rib meat. I questioned the counter guy, and he immediately hid in the back for the remainder of my visit. I left the uneaten portion on my tray, on the counter as a clear message. I WILL NOT RETURN. Please view the picture I took..for the Kyoto Bowl employees, go eat at your competitor in Tempe Marketplace to taste what you are up against."}
{"text":"Fantastic find! Fresh, authentic Japanese food. Savory menu at a fair price. Very clean eating environment. I had the veggie friend rice, spring roll, edamame, and Mountain Dew. What an Extremely Delicious Lunch!! Thank you for a really pleasant lunch. Respectful and polite service all-around, I must add."}
{"text":"Kyoto Bowl looks like a dive because it is one. But hey, they make good food.

I have never seen another person at this establishment and I'm convinced I'm the only one keeping them open, but it's worth it.

The teriyaki chicken is always great, their eggrolls are cooked well, and they have something for everyone (fried rice, sushi, noodle bowls, etc.)

I've been going to Kyoto Bowl since I was a kid (thanks mom!) and it's still a favorite."}
{"text":"Ahhhh, Kyoto Bowl. I used to live around the corner from this branch and have many fond memories of walking there. My parents have ZERO tolerance for more adventurous food. My sister is scared to death of fish (because it once had a head, I know, the terror...). My mom knew of nothing else except colonial food (chicken, mash potatoes, etc.) so when I turned old enough to work, I would walk here in my efforts to seek different food. 

I learned to like California rolls, noodles and tofu here. They have hot, green tea for 75 cents. Not bad. If you want to eat healthy and don't want to pay dinner price and tip and you want simple sushi, I recommend Kyoto Bowl. The tinkling fountain makes it relaxing."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since it's close to my office.  The best thing about it is how fast the service is.  The orange chicken sauce does taste very good but the meat is usually a bit dry.  The rice is also a little under cooked.  Going in you can only expect so much from fast casual Asian restaurant that still has its 80s decor."}
{"text":"Slow place. Not too bad. Order their number one. Teriyaki chicken, egg roll, white rice and drink. Chicken was tasty and good. The egg roll tasted old not very hot. 
Ok for the value"}
{"text":"This place is good for what it is... A cheap, mock Asian food place. Don't come here expecting gourmet or authentic food. Sometimes it's the cheap overly Americanized stuff that's the best. The chicken teryiaki bowl is great. The sauce is sweet and they really put a lot of it, I just wish they would put more chicken and veggies."}
{"text":"Usually love Kyoto bowl but the last 2 times we have ordered there we have been disappointed.  We ordered the hot & spicy chicken and the chicken was dry and there were absolutely no veggies and the dish was flavorless.  I understand one time that there could be a training issue but for this to happen twice alarms me.  I will give it one more try then it is off my list of quick weeknight dinners."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. This is the second time I've been here, because it's walking distance from my apartment. Both times this place was empty and smelled like death sprayed with windex. The first visit, I ordered the tuna sushi roll. This was BAD quality tuna. 

Fast forward one year and a half later. I reluctantly stopped at Kyoto Bowl, being that it is walking distance and I was starving. 

I ordered the veggie bowl and it was a very sad concoction of a SKIMPY veggie mix. 3 carrot shreds, 3 tiny and flimsy broccoli quarters, and the rest were soggy onions and those god awful baby corns. Yuck! I am absolutely convinced that this was microwaved frozen vegetable mix. This bowl had NO life to it whatsoever and I swear, tasted like the color grey. Picked out the carrots and broccoli, and threw away the rest. Walked out of this place totally malnourished. I don't see how this place is still in business. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"Take 15 pounds of typical Asian fast food entrees, dump them in a laundry machine with sugar instead of detergent, and serve on a fresh lump of sticky steamed rice. Don't get me wrong, its still decent. But that's the caliber of what you should expect here.

This place has got the cheer of a rest stop restroom. The guy I seem to always order form always looks like a manic depressive. But hey, if you want calories and it's on the way, go for it."}
{"text":"This place is actually not good. I went here several times before finally putting my foot down. It is worth a couple extra bucks and walking two blocks to go to Stingray, or really, anywhere else. Like, this place is actually bad, I am unclear on their rating or how they are still in business. I'll give them an extra star for decent service."}
{"text":"Gross. It was noon on a weekday and only three customers. That should have been the first clue. They were out of beef. At noon. The chicken was dry and tasted old. The vegetables tasted old and were inedible. Even the rice sucked."}
{"text":"The worst food I've ever had. I ordered a beef teriyaki bowl. The teriyaki sauce tasted bland and watered down. The vegetables were limp and flavor less. And the beef was like thinly sliced cheap roast beef. The whole experience was a waste of money and time. I will never step foot in this establishment again.  I could have gotten a better tasting rice bowl at Jack in the Box."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday. Immediately smashed with nostalgia walking through the door. Looks like it has been untouched since the mid 90's. I liked the vibe, for memories sake, so I gave it a shot. Too bad the menu doesn't match my memory of the 90's. The generic chicken teriyaki bowl combo was 10 freakin' dollars!
It wasn't bad but damn was it not 10 dollars worth. The sauce was hard meh and the egg roll was just alright.
My girlfriend got the spicy beef and it was pretty atrocious. Rice was hard and undercooked, beef was really bad, and the salad that came with it was just watery iceberg with some shaved carrots. 
I didn't mind what I got but her lunch was downright terrible. Overall, dig the old school vibe but the price isn't right for the glorified dog food they fix in the kitchen."}
{"text":"It was like taking a trip back in time when I walked in. The decor used now is the same as back in the early 90's that I grew up with (though a bit faded). Somehow, I like that it hasn't changed. After living in California for 8 years, it was nice to come back to something VERY familiar.

The cashiers are friendly enough. Last week she took my order, and said thank you, with a smile, at the end. The male cashier, tonight, was fine too, I don't have high expectations at a fast food joint. As long as you don't spit in my food, we're cool.

The food is good if you are looking for a good cheap meal that doesn't contain a burger and fries. It definitely isn't authentic Japanese food. (Of course, if you think Panda Express is authentic Chinese food, or if you like to douse your rice in soy sauce, this is the real ish.) 

I highly recommend the veggie egg rolls. They are so good I could literally eat them every day. I don't know what's in them, but they are amazing.

The house chicken is great if you're dining in as it will become a bit soggy if you take it to go. The steam from the rice softens the crispy exterior quite a bit. It's a little bit sweet, and a little bit sour - but it isn't like sweet and sour chicken. It has little bits of pickled carrots and cucumbers (I think) mixed in and some green onions thrown on top. 

The teriyaki chicken is great if you're dining in or taking out. If you don't like a lot of sauce on your Teriyaki, ask for it on the side. They really lay on the sauce.

The fortune cookies are hit or miss depending on who is working. Usually the girl cashiers are a bit more generous (or maybe I'm just that cute.)"}
{"text":"Despite the reviews, decided to give this place a try since I get my haircut next door at brigades barbershop. Hands down best barber shop. Tim is great. Anyway, in California there's this place called Yoshinoya, delicious place! Kyoto bowl is actually as close as you can get. The teriyaki bowl with rice was only 6 bucks and it was delicious with ginger and hot chilli powder! Not sure why the bad rep, I'll come here again next time I cut my hair."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch last Friday and ordered a Teriyaki bowl. There was one other party in the restaurant besides me. That should have given me a clue right there. The person who took my order was decent. I got the order rather quickly. It tasted good but when I got down to the end I was very shocked. I took a look at a 3\" strip of chicken I was saving just to check it out. Well there was some chicken but mostly fat and grissle. I put it back into the bowl and threw it away. That is something I would throw away and not serve to anyone. I thought what are these people thinkin serving something like this to someone. Please avoid this restaurant no matter what you want to eat."}
{"text":"I was hoping to run into a Yoshi's, but I was on 32nd Street instead of 24th, so I went to this place instead. I ordered the #1 (teriyaki chicken and rice) with all white meat. The chicken was decent, if a bit on the dry side, but I didn't mind. The rice was good and sticky.  But there was merely a drizzle across the top of the bowl of teriyaki sauce. I got it to go, so when I got home and saw it, I was just disappointed. It wasn't bad, if I had ordered a dry bowl of rice with chicken on top...but alas, I won't be going back unless I am in dire straits and am out of options. It was just kinda bleh."}
{"text":"I live really close so it's easy to get great Japanese food. Fast service for takeout and delicious Spicy Teriyaki chicken."}
{"text":"I'm the type of person that appreciates good service as much as the food.  Kyoto bowl is quick, good and, at least at this location, was helped by a very friendly staff. Ordered the large veggie bowl (very filling), the veggie egg roll (yum!) and the side salad with ranch.  While Kyoto bowl will never be accused of being luxury dining, it is good and fairly priced."}
{"text":"I probably should have yelped it before I went there.  But I was on the road and craving a rice bowl.  The place is dark (makes it dingy for me) and it was so quite for a lunch crowd.  Ordered the house chicken togo.  The taste of the sauce was weird...  not to garlicy, just blah...  Very disappointed...  Never going back!"}
{"text":"Great service. Great Japanese food. I live near bye so I find myself wanting Kyoto bowl often. Great place to take someone who is new to the area."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced. Got the spicy chicken terriaki and it wasn't even spicy. Nor do they have any spicy sauce to give you, besides jalepeno sauce. I also ordered a salad with ranch. The ranch is your ordinary store bought bottle kind, and the salad lacked any green leafs. They also charge you for fortune cookies! I won't go back to this location."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Even knowing what I was going in for, I wasn't impressed.

I went in wanting something with veggies, and I knew they had a \"chicken teriyaki and vegetables\" bowl. I put that in quotes, because I'm not really sure that it qualifies for \"and vegetables\" based on what I received. They definitely got the chicken part right--there was plenty of it. But there were scant vegetables. I suppose I should expect that from a fast food type place, but I was still disappointed. The food was extremely bland, which was rather surprising considering the amount of sauce on top of all that chicken. The positive is that there is a brown rice option.

It's a clean place with decent service, although the decor is pretty darn old. If the food tasted better and contained some more of what it purports to contain, I'd come back. But it doesn't, so I won't."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a chance but what do you expect from a low-cost model Japanese/Chinese restaurant. My sushi had a weird taste and the rice in my California rolls was just bearable. Chicken Teriyaki bowl was not very appetizing."}
{"text":"The food is great the people that work here are completely worthless. They never answer the phone and every time I come in here there's literally no one here so it's not like the place is too busy to not answer the phone. My order is always wrong the girl working the front counter sucks. I called and placed an order and she had no recollection of it at all literally 10 minutes prior. Please get new help!! There were kids yelling in the back, just totally unprofessional place will probably never come back as long as the crew stays the same."}
{"text":"Best ever! Family owned and operated, great food, been coming here twice a week, every week, for the past year. Can't say enough great things about the owner at this location. Still haven't been to the other locations yet. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Cashier was rude, I had to ask for my fortune cookie (if you knew me, you'd understand I'm huge on fortune cookies, it's a big deal for me), foods not that good, foods not that good, the carrots tasted and smelled like a cow farm, if that makes sense (New Englanders will understand), I will give them the positive feedback on the environment being cute. My chicken however was too chewy."}
{"text":"I feel bad as I am sure the owners are just trying to make a buck, but the food has really went downhill. I think this will be my last visit here as it is overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Don't eat here. JUST. DON'T.


I hadn't had Kyoto Bowl in over a decade and I now remember why. 

Absolutely disappointing. They have not bothered to make any changes to anything for about 2 decades.

I got the Teriyaki Beef (at least that's what it said it was) but I am not sure this was actually Beef. 

It looked weird, did not taste like beef and had a weird texture.

I didn't even eat a quarter of the bowl before I decided this is sub-par and very questionable.

My teenage daughter got some noodle bowl which was overkill on the saltiness and she didn't even eat half of her dish. 

In addition, the menu is the EXACT same menu, same style & design, same offerings since BEFORE the year 2000!

I should have gone with my gut (screaming NO! DON'T EAT HERE!) when I saw that this restaurant has had not one single update since BEFORE 2000!

This location will be out of business before this time next year, guaranteed."}
{"text":"I ordered the teriyaki chicken, which is apparently their specialty, and priced accordingly.  It was $7 for a medium sized bowl and drink.  The chicken was mediocre and the rice was kinda gummy.  

Even still, this wouldn't have warranted the one star until I bit into a chunk of bone that they forgot to sift out.  Nasty."}
{"text":"Wasn't a bad place; nice, clean, organized and the food wasn't bad but not the best. Service was quick, wasn't as expensive as I thought would be. I'd recommend trying the porks chop; basically the dumplings with meat inside. :D"}
{"text":"Now I wasn't expecting a 10 star, but 10 dollars for spicy beef bowl, store bought salad and a drink.   Where's the beef and overcooked tofu, with very little veggies.   We made this mistake twice,  we won't be back.   Also the owner said the credit card machine was not working so that generated cash, hence no record of the transaction.   Buyer be where dont go here, go next door to Subway."}
{"text":"There is no place better to get teriyaki chicken bowl! I have lived in AZ my whole life and this place has been around forever! So Delicious"}
{"text":"In my opinion this place was absolute trash. My beef bowl was swimming in teriyaki sauce and looked more like dog food than actual food. Also the one guy working here was extremely rude.

I will never come back and doubt this place will be in business much longer."}
{"text":"The two stars are for a clean restaurant and clean bathroom. The quality of food is not good. The sauce is the same sauce from 10 years ago. Unfortunately the chicken is fatty and the beef is thin and gross. I used to love this place, unfortunately I feel it has fallen off. I don't recommend paying $10 for low quality. There are too many other options with better quality."}
{"text":"Kyoto bowl has the best teriyaki bowls I've ever had in my life. Hands down. They cut out the vegetables you always push to the side anyway and load you up on chicken and yummy sticky rice. Don't even get me started on the sauce!!!!!"}
{"text":"I get food here once in a blue moon when I'm in a hurry, and don't want to cook. 
Sometimes you just want to pick up a bowl of fried rice, Edename, and an iced tea. 
It's okay for a fast food joint, and at least they don't microwave their dishes. I saw them cook my order and the guy used a wok. 
It's cheap enough, It's fast enough, and that's good enough for me."}
{"text":"Fast food, Japanese style.  Kyoto Bowl serves up teriyaki dishes, curries, and stir fried items over rice.  Service is fast and cheerful.  The dishes have decent portion sizes, with decent flavor.  I can get full from a regular sized bowl, but for those that want bigger portions they do offer large bowls too.  The decor is a little dated, and it always seems dead when I've gotten food from here.  In fact, when chatting with the barista at the nearby Dutch Bros, when I mentioned I just came from Kyoto Bowl, the nicest thing she could say about it was \"Oh, it's so quiet there, isn't it!?\""}
{"text":"Japanese fast food at reasonable rates.  I go here sometimes if we are in the area and want something in a rice bowl.  All the bowls I've gotten here have been pretty good, but it honestly doesn't compare to Teriyaki Kitchen on Guadalupe and Dobson, which has a wider selection of fast food Japanese with similar prices."}
{"text":"The food is too expensive. The portions aren't very good for the price. Across the street is Panda Express which is about the same amount of food, cheaper and has a drive-thru. The gentleman at the front counter that takes orders at the register had a cup in his hand taking a sip of his drink while taking my order. Then he proceeded to say hello to a customer I assume is a regular and threw something at him. It was all very unprofessional to say the least all while taking my order. Needless to say I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Shrimp teriyaki? Sounds risky, but if it's on the menu it should be safe. Right?

Wrong. 

The fishy flavor of the shrimp does not play well with the sweetness of teriyaki. 

Also, the Diet Pepsi here tastes really awful."}
{"text":"Food is priced right.  It is cooked to order. Service is prompt.  I come here often and have enjoyed Kyoto Bowl for a decade. The decor could use a refresh.  Overall I like this place."}
{"text":"Well this place sucks, I got serviced a raw teriyaki chicken bowl and a day old looking vegetable roll!"}
{"text":"I havent been to kyoto bowl in over 8 years. The food is just the same as it was when I went last. They actually werent stingy on the teriyaki sauce as the one on bell road made you pay for more.

The place has always been dated looking even in early 2000 when I went there a lot.

Who cares otherwise its clean."}
{"text":"Gave this place another try.  I was disappointed.  in the 90's I went here during my High School lunch hour.  I am quite certain the standards have fallen greatly.  The one star reviews are correct.  This place is always dead for a reason.  I took my food back and got a refund.

Chicken was microwaved
Rice was underdone (how does an Asian restaurant get rice wrong?)
Teriyaki sauce was totally weak and tasteless.

A few years ago, I ordered the Orange chicken, it was inedible, and I am pretty sure it was microwaved.  The breading was very soggy, with no crunch at all.

It doesn't take much to run a place like this.  I'm so disappointed and angry.  I wish this place would just close down and stop tempting me with my fond memories of the 90's."}
{"text":"Still sitting here writing the review. I have NO idea why so many negative reviews.

I like the places I eat to be CLEAN, service to be GREAT, and food to taste DELICIOUS.

This place meets all 3. The decor is just as I remember it from when I was a tiny kid 20 years ago, but it's very clean, no word smell, as another reviewer said, and it's te best YakiSoba I've had in Phoenix, though I'll admit that bar isn't set too high.

Definitely recommend. I'll edit this later to add more detail, but just wanted to make sure to post."}
{"text":"Fair prices for fine food, I have been going here for years. The service in not super speedy but it fits a need for faster Japanese food not available very many places."}
{"text":"I think the food is as good as it was ten to fifteen years ago.  I feel bad for this particular location as the neighborhood had hit the skids, and the lite-rail keeps depositing a steady stream of homeless and downtrodden individuals right out front.
The orange chicken was great.  (Tip: Order your chicken dish with all white meat to avoid getting the parts of the chicken that have no name).  I thought the place was clean and the food good.  
I do think its time to remove the long ago empty and unused fish tank, kind of depressing and a sad internal reminder of what the neighborhood has become."}
{"text":"Had the chicken teriyaki and after a few bites, I was pretty sure it was the pigeons from out side. Lol jk but it was pretty bad. Do not Recommend!"}
{"text":"Get a white meat teriyaki bowl and a ginger side salad. Can't go wrong at all!! Get all fancy and you are in the wrong place."}
{"text":"No.

Just about the most \"blah\" food I have ever eaten.  The \"beef teriyaki\" I had was cooked cold cut beef (like the kind you get in a philly cheese steak sandwich), mixed with sauce and thawed frozen broccoli, spread on top of Uncle Ben's rice and microwaved.  Beef egg rolls?  Little taste at all.

My wife's \"chicken teriyaki\" was of similar quality to my entree, but to her credit, she couldn't eat it.

The price was right, the taste was wrong, and I got quite sick about an hour later.

No.  Not again."}
{"text":"First time ever eating here and it was delish. I tried the chicken fried rice bowl combo , which comes with a egg roll and drink. It is a little on the expensive side but not too bad . The food is worth it . The establishment from what I seen of it was clean. The employee was a little gloomy though.  But over all experience was great"}
{"text":"Don't even bother! Disgusting lunch and a waste of my hard earned $16.00!!! The \"teriyaki sauce\" was a bland, tasteless gravy smothering mushy meat. I had beef which was a greyish thin presentation of beef while my husband had chicken which was also tasteless. The eggroll was inedible!! Freezer burnt and tasted of old fryer grease! The entire place was dated, and overall a MASSIVE disappointment. I wish I would have just gone to Jack-in-the-Box across the street and saved me $10 bucks! Ugh...I'm gonna go throw up my lunch now!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken and veg bowl. It was so bad that I threw most of it away. It's drenched in sugary sauce, and the chicken still has tendons and fat on it. Not great al all."}
{"text":"I stopped here in search of a place with decent sautéed noodles with tofu and this is what I found. I would not recommend this place. The man whom I assume is the owner of the place took about five minutes to approach the counter and ask if we were ready to order. He my order wrong and struggled to understand what I wanted. After partially eating the food I began to have a stomach ache. I blame the tofu as it looked undercooked and not only that it didn't have much flavor. I advise do not go there."}
{"text":"This is the location on 7th Ave and Camelback that I'm referring to.  I usually go to Yoshi's but they are closed on Sundays.  Walked in and it was hot and smelled like a drain.  You know when you walk into bathrooms sometimes they have that sewer-y smell?  That's what it smelled like right away.  I wanted to leave but the guy behind the counter already saw me and I'm Midwestern so...I ordered the teriyaki bowl.  There was no music playing and NO ONE else in the restaurant on a Sunday, which should have been some indication, because these hipsters down here love to brunch.  Ok so the \"food\"  was nuclear hot, but pretty sure it was just reheated in a microwave or boiled in a bag.  The chicken had that fake rubbery chicken texture.  The teriyaki sauce was thick and tasted like syrup.  The rice was ok. You can taste the terrible phoenix tap water in the fountain drinks, which indicates that they don't filter their water.  The guy working there was playing Pokemon Go or something but he was clearly annoyed to have any trade and said as few words to me as possible.  There was no smile, no please, no thank you, no courtesy.  I hate Subway, even before the Jared thing, I think it's gross with terrible bread and fillers, but I wished to God I had gone to the Subway next door instead."}
{"text":"Poor quality food and terrible service. I hope they pay attention to these reviews and make some changes."}
{"text":"Food was bland and not very good.  Didnt even have any hot sauce.  Place could use an update on the decor as well..."}
{"text":"Not terrible food, but not good either.  I'd never go back because good food is very easy to come by out here.  

I had the Sukiyaki beef bowl.  It was beef, cabbage, and onion over rice.  There was a sauce used, but it might have just been soy sauce.  I got salt and umami out of it.  It was pretty much just overcooked beef and veggies over bad rice that was very salty.  It was $7.XX, but I should have gotten a hamburger at Wendy's or a salad at Safeway, because that would have been better.  

I dislike it when reviewers waste my time talking about decor, but holy straight out of the 1990's!  Really dim, none of the signs are on, and the wall menu was one of those big black panels with yellow lettering that was backlit.  It really set the stage for the D- food.  It felt like walking into a Bradley's or Caldoor in 1993.

I don't want to give 1 star, because 1 star places really did something to deserve it.  This place was just extremely underwhelming."}
{"text":"This chain revels in '90s kitsch, which I love because all these ugly pastel blues and pinks reminds me of how stupid design was in 1992. Please don't change it!

I went here yesterday and no one was here during lunch hour on a Sunday. Strange, but whatever. Ordered teriyaki chicken and the lady friend ordered ... something. She didn't know what it was but it had noodles and some kind of bird meat. My rice bowl tasted decent and generic and I finished it halfway. The Girl couldn't get through two bites of her meal because it didn't taste like chicken (maybe it was duck? I doubt it.) and it smelled like fish. She also didn't finish her eggroll. How do you screw one of those up?

Later, the Girl said she was lucky we didn't get food poisoning, but I still used it as an excuse to get out of work the next day. Ha! Take that corporate America! I would probably eat here again because I have a stomach lined with acid stronger than that stuff in the Alien movies, but I won't be taking my sugarpie loverbuns anywhere near here.

Love,
Tekel"}
{"text":"All Kyoto Bowls are pretty much the same, so this review could apply to any of them. It's OK. If you're on a diet, it's pretty good because it's low-fat, low-cal, and better tasting than a salad. Some of the upcharges are just silly - brown rice wholesale is basically the same price as white rice, so why the $1 upcharge? The steamed veggies are heavy on cabbage on celery and light on the tastier more colorful veggies. And no Japanese curry??? Or Katsu???

The decor is just awful - everything is a depressing shad of teal (everything! walls, booths, chairs, etc), with 1980's faux brass finishes everywhere. Dim lighting and a lots of ugly spindly plants everywhere round out the picture; a depressing ambience overall. 

If you want cheap, good, big portions of Japanese fast food, with an eating area that won't make you suicidal, hit Yoshi's (two locations in Phoenix) or Tokyo Stop in Tempe. (See my reviews)"}
{"text":"Tried the Spicy teriyaki beef the other day it was alright. Nothing amazing really, it fills you up because of it's fair portion. It felt like when I ordered the chicken I would get more than the beef. The beef was pretty thin so when eating it wasn't as satisfying as the chicken, as the chicken had more bite to it. So in my opinion if you are going to eat there, I would recommend the chicken. Overall it could be better."}
{"text":"I love this location the food is very tasty and hot. The workers are very nice I recommend!"}
{"text":"Terrible lunch consisted of tough, stringy chicken smothered in a too sweet teriyaki sauce, an old, greasy egg roll, even the soda was flat! Don't waste your time or money here, I won't be back. The place is dead, no one in there at lunch time when other places are packed, now I know why."}
{"text":"Not horrible, but not great. It kinda makes me think of it as a younger sibling to a noodle place in a mall. Definitely felt the 90's vibe with the decor."}
{"text":"Ewwww! I drive by this place everyday. Thought I would give it a shot today. I took 2 bites and had to throw the rest away. I will never come here again. The owners should be embarrassed to serve this slop. I wish I could get my $7 back."}
{"text":"Not at all close to any authentic Japanese.  The terriyaki beef bowl was terrible.   It tasted like the meat and sauce were pre made and then microwaved.  
If you never tried authentic Japanese than this is for you!  Not worth the money$$."}
{"text":"Was starving, so I tried this spot.  I have been to other locations, and this one does not compare.  The teriyaki chicken had sauce that seemed very watered down, the egg roll tasted strange and when opened, the ingredients were very dry.   I took three bites.....   couldn't do it so I tossed it.  I was very disappointed and will not go back. But the svc was great and good came out quickly."}
{"text":"No more Kyoto Bowl for me.  They have the fattest beef slices and their teriyaki sauce is super sweet.  Too much flavor for my taste buds perhaps."}
{"text":"I gave it four stars, because for what it is supposed to do, it does well. I ALWAYS order a number one combo, white meat, large. If you are on a diet, this place doesn't make it seem so bad. I think I could probably live off this. I can't really contribute more, because I have never ventured outside the realm of the number one combo...... Sorry."}
{"text":"Juan and pancho running he Restaurant. Rather then Chang and wong! Need say more ? 
Food had no flavor of real Chinese food. Lol"}
{"text":"Samurai Sam's is way better."}
{"text":"Mediocre, overpriced food and a terrible wait for two containers of pre-made sushi and a salad, to go.  

Oh, and tip jars at the registers.  Tips jars for what exactly?  It's fast food.   

On the plus side, if you don't count the well-worn signage, and the old faded décor it is very clean.

I almost forgot, for sheer entertainment purposes, make sure to check out the misspelled sign in the ladies room!  (Sorry guys, you are out of luck on this one!)"}
{"text":"We were hungry and not willing to wait to cook or for restaurant service so we decided to grab some Subway on our way home.  At the last minute we changed our minds and got Kyoto Bowl instead.  The husband was a little over-enthusiastic to try it and I warned him to keep his expectations low, but not as low as Yoshinoya Beef Bowl low, ugh.  Anyway, we walk in, and as expected the place is decorated like every other Kyoto Bowl with ugly white tiles and ugly white benches.  There is too much white, and considering the location, it was more like grey.  They also had two fish tanks for me to stare at while waiting for our order.  One of them was half drained and the other had half a dozen tetras swimming around.  Real fancy.

Anyway, I got the Teriyaki Chicken and an egg roll because nothing else really sounded good.  There isn't a lot to choose from anyway.  The husband got the Orange Chicken.  My Teriyaki chicken was just meh.  The chicken was a little overcooked and the sauce was so bland.  I figured for sure I would get a tasty, over-garlicky sauce here, but no.  The egg roll was okay, a little soggy though.  I also found it a bit odd that the meat inside the egg roll was beef.  I thought pork was the norm.  Anyway, this place is definitely not worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"I went here to lunch with my mom and fiance, My expectations were higher and they were not met as I thought they would be. HOWEVER it's not a horrible restaurant, it just wouldn't be my first option again. 
Each of us ordered a kyoto bowl and the price totaled around $33.00 and we each got a drink. I wasn't impressed with the food because it tasted bland. I added the terriyaki sauce and it didnt help. I hope that you do try this place though because I feel like it was an off day. 
The gentleman who helped us was extremely nice and helpful so I definitely admire their patience with us and helpfulness. We will be back to try it again & try another thing off the menu!"}
