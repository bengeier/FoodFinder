{"text":"I've eaten here maybe a handful of times.bA little on the expensive side (was charged 2.00 for pepperoni on kinda small pizza) but they have pretty good burgers. Would recommend trying them."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place. The food is always so good. The goblet burger is my favorite. The inside has a nice atmosphere and the girls were super nice too. 
* I don't give away 5 stars"}
{"text":"Had dinner with 5 other people Wednesday evening. Arrived to many dirty, unserviceable tables. Waited for 10 minutes while tables were cleaned. Food is mediocre at best. The fish was ordered by 3 and they seemed to like it, I've had better many other places. I ordered the Goblet burger, it would have been excellent had it been served on a better quality bun, like pretzel, artisan, Kaiser, etc. Wait staff very disorganized, mixed up orders, checks, drinks, etc. If they had been busy you could excuse a little, but they weren't. Decor is really outdated and lighting is very poor, I had to use flashlight on phone to read menu and check. Truly doubt I will return, many other restaurants in area that are much better."}
{"text":"Came specifically for the 'award winning' fish. It was basic fried fish, honestly very little flavor. The hush puppies w sauce were very good. Service was so bad. It was 20 min before our drink order was taken. It really could not have been much slower without walking out. There was more than 30 min between our hush puppies arrived and our sandwiches arrived. We saw several families in the back room looking for a waitress. By late march the Christmas garland could have been taken down. 

So - we would skip it next time. Maybe patronize a church fish fry during lent - they are far better prepared!"}
{"text":"I also got pulled in by the sign. Award winning fish, homemade beef stew and meatloaf. In the lobby the special soup was listed as homemade dteak and potato. Sat on the bar side and was informed that none of the items were available!!  Had a canned cup of chili and left"}
{"text":"Good drafts.  My old haunt from the early 80's is still kicking.  This place always had good draft beer.  Not a foodie stop this time.  The staff is friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Excellent Reuben sandwich and a very good fish sandwich.  They have a dining room that is separate from the bar and no smoking is permitted in the dining room
Avoid the bar which is full of regulars. And you will smell like smoke in its small confines.   But you can DINE in the dining room and order an adult beverage with your meal if you desire.  

I rate the food above average.  BUT only 2 stars will be awarded because the place is kinda pricey considering that NO sides are included with your sandwich.  Want fries with that? You'll pay extra.   I say BOO to that for what they charge."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today had a cup of split pea with ham, and a tuna cobb salad. Soup was delicious so hearty and thick, definitely homemade. I was expecting canned tuna on my salad, wrong!  I was served a tuna steak cooked medium rare, so unexpected but so good. Now that the road work is done I'll be back, staff is so nice, even the owner asked how we liked our meal. Great place!"}
{"text":"It was about 11:45am and we stopped in for lunch and there were about 6 men sitting at the bar.. you can tell they're regulars who all know eachother, and this is just another stop in their daily routine.  The only reason I mention that is because, as someone who ISN'T a regular, walking in to that can be intimidating.  You walk in, not sure of where you're even going, and everyone just stops and stares at you.  Honestly, that's basically where the uncomfort ended.  They don't mean any harm, it just is what it is.  We mentioned to the bar tender that we were wanting to get lunch but the dining room doors were locked, and she apologized and took us to the dining room instead (apparently the dining room opens at 12, and they hadn't unlocked the doors yet - no big deal).  The bar is a smoking area, so if that bothers you, beware.  The dining room, however, is non-smoking.  It's a very small area, with 3 booths and maybe 6 tables that seat 4 each.  The decor is kind of outdated and is a nautical theme (..?), and the music matches the not-recently-updated atmosphere.  As long as all of that doesnt matter to you, this place is pretty good!  It's your typical little local, \"caters mostly to regulars\" establishment (or so it seems, anyway), but truthefully, the food is good and the people are friendly.  I tried their \"Award Winning\" fish sandwich, and it was a good fish sandwich, but for the price, I think I'd opt to go elsewhere for something so readily available just about anywhere.  They offer it in 3 different sizes - Small, Medium, & X-Large - all for different prices, and it comes totally plain and with no sides.  You can add a side for $3, and then every topping you add is .50.  So by the time I had it the way I wanted, I was paying around $13 for a fish sandwich at lunch time, when I could have had the same thing (or better) elsewhere for cheaper.  I'm not saying not to try it, but I may be saying to try something else..
We did order the \"Bang Bang Shrimp\" to start with, and those were legit!  It's not a big portion, but they were so good!
My husband ordered the steak sub which he seemed to enjoy - it looked pretty good to me!

Anyway, the service was prompt and friendly, and the prices, while I wouldn't say were great, weren't too bad.  It'll definitely be on our radar from now on where we're craving something simple and inexpensive.  I'd say try it out for sure, it's not a bad little place!"}
{"text":"Don't go in with nice clothes cause you'll come out smelling like an ash tray! Bar is awkwardly small. The entire crowd are regulars and i was definitely out of my element. I won't return."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best. The waitress completely ignored me when I first walked in and I had to walk around the other side to finally get service. It smelled like a giant ashtray in there and on my clothes. I get home with the food and realize they forgot an order of onion rings. Won't be returning."}
