{"text":"Found this restaurant on yelp and couldn't have been happier with the food and the service. Great selection on coffees and espressos. Almost every dish is served with a beautiful assortment of fruit. They also have freshly squeezed orange juice which was delicious and refreshing. Definitely get a side of toast- totally worth all the carbs!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday.  Food made me think of a diner. Decor is old and needs to be renewed. The obodum Omelette is rally good. The potatoes on the other hand were too salty and it looked like the toasts had been drenched in butter. When bitting in the toast, you could feel the butter coming out of the bread. And the fruits are decorations.  They are so small that there's not even half a portion of fruit in the plate. The bacon was not cooked enough to my taste but I forgot to ask for it well done. I'm only giving it 2 stars because breakfast is something that is pretty simple and hard to miss. But they managed to miss half of it."}
{"text":"Location: In the same strip mall space as Metro. Parking is available but limited, especially during peak breakfast/brunch hours.  The place: Don't expect anything fancy - it's a breakfast place with very plain decor. Size is good and they can accommodate a pretty high number of people.   Food: Personally, I find it very, very ordinary. It's good, but it's not at the top of my list in terms of breakfast places. The variety is good.  Price: Very affordable. In fact, it's one of the only places in the area that doesn't try to rip you off."}
{"text":"We've been here for breakfast 9 or 10  times.    We rent a house in Ste Agathe and make the 15 or 20 minute drive there. It's very much a local place, extremely casual and looks like every other chain breakfast place in Quebec.  Bring the kids, the grandkids, etc. Food is similar to Cora breakfast, around the same price. It's comfortable - it won't surprise you and that's absolutely fine."}
{"text":"C'est une ambiance assez traditionnelle qui ressemble aux grandes chaînes de déjeuners. Rien d'exceptionnel sur le menu et les prix sont quand même assez élevés. La qualité et la quantité des plats est bien. Service un peu long mais les gens sont souriants.   Les gaufres étaient très tendres et les fruits assez frais. Le café est à volonté et ils remplissent régulièrement. La terrasse est couverte au plafond et sur 1 côté donc pas de problèmes pour la pluie. C'est familiale donc ne vous gênez pas pour emmener les enfants."}
{"text":"Une belle petite place pour le déjeuner! Bon service et plats pour le déjeuner attrayant et très bon!"}
{"text":"Nous avons pris notre petit déjeuner à cet endroit, situé non loin et en face du manoir saint sauveur.  C'est un restaurant pour les petits déjeuners de type Cora ou tutti frutti. J'avais pris une crêpe jambon fromage suisse et une assiette avec 2 oeufs miroirs, des fèves au lard et quelques fruits.  Généralement, la concurrence fait mieux sur 2 points : 1) La quantité de fruits est minime dans chaque assiette (3 morceaux), il faut prendre un bol de fruits en extra à 7$ si mes souvenirs sont exacts ! 2) Le rapport qualité prix est élevé.  Le lendemain matin, nous sommes restés au manoir saint sauveur pour prendre le petit déjeuner où le buffet est un peu meilleur pour environ le même prix.  Mes notes : Ambiance : 7/10, Service : 6/10, Nourriture : 6/10, Propreté : 7/10, Rapport Qualité prix : 6/10 Ma note globale : 6.4/10"}
{"text":"With the political climate the way it is I was almost hesitant to go further north and have to deal with all the french that refuse to speak English. It's a good thing that I've perfected the art of ordering my 2 eggs over easy, bacon well done, with white non buttered bread. When we walked in we were waiting to be served and the hostess overheard my husband and I speaking English so she gave us English menus.   We flipped the pages a few times trying to decide what to to eat and I settled on my above mentioned breakfast while the kiddo had a fruit platter and the hubby a breakfast club.    The waitress was very sweet and tried her damnest to speak English while we tried to reply in French. She saw my two year old getting a bit antsy so she brought her a coloring book with crayons.  The food was very good and the house fries had some really good seasoning. I found the place pricey though for what you are getting.  10.95$ for two eggs, a few strips of bacon, with house fries and \"Fruit\" which consisted of a slice of cantaloupe and pineapple.  7.95$ for a fruit cup. Literally, it wasn't a place of fruit with english cream or anything. It was a tiny bowl that you serve a single scoop of ice cream in...  .then again we did go up north to a tourist trap."}
{"text":"I have been here 4 or 5 times. I find it worn out and in great need of a refreshed decor. The food is okay, equivalent to a standard dinner.  Over priced, not a good value. I will return only if they make sweeping changes."}
{"text":"Mostly great food, complemented by exquisite fresh fruit.  7 dishes were great.  Eggs Benedict was very bad.  Overpriced, partly due to the location near Ski Resorts."}
{"text":"This place has been here for as long as I can remember, it is dated in the decor and has not changed one bit since it opened.   The food is average, nothing really stands out, but I have to say the service is pretty good, the food comes to the table quickly even when the place is packed.   My only really big complaint is that I ordered in English and my waitress who obviously understood what I was saying would only reply in French."}
{"text":"Le Obodum est un petit restaurant chaleureux et convivial, se situant entre le Cora Déjeuners et le Tutti Frutti. Nous y avons déjeuné lors de notre séjour à Saint-Sauveur.  Les plats étaient corrects, mes oeufs étaient bien brouillés, et la grosseur de l'assiette était raisonnable. Cependant, moi qui aime bien les fruits, il n'y en avait que 3 maigres tranches dans mon assiette ; une petite tranche de cantaloup, une petite tranche d'ananas et une petite tranche de melon miel.  Les prix étaient un peu élevés pour ce qu'il y avait dans l'assiette.  En général, les lieux étaient propres, mais le service était un peu long. Cela nous a permis de discuter un peu en lisant le journal et en attendant la serveuse qui avait, il faut bien l'avouer, un charmant sourire."}
{"text":"Simple breakfast place in a cozy environment. I rarely dine at breakfast restaurants and tend to find them all comparable. Great for big portions, bacon, eggs and toast type meal - I don't think I saw pancakes on the menu though which was disappointing. Only thin crepes or waffles.  My ham and swiss cheese omelette was tasty, and very generous with the cheese, however the egg was dry. The fresh pressed orange juice was also too sour for my liking. The highlight was the toast, thick, moist buttered bread topped off with my choice of honey and jam.  Portion and price wise, most things off the menu are affordable however 5$ for a glass of  juice seemed like a little much.   I wouldn't come here every weekend, but it's good for a home style breakfast if you're on vacation."}
{"text":"Dans le coin, c'est le plus rapide, moins guindé des déjeuner. On y vas pas pour une expérience culinaire mais pour un deux oeuf bacon classique. Service rapide et courtois. Attention: en saison de touriste peut être bondé."}
