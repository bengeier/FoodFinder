{"text":"We're from montreal (the home of Cora's) and are generally a fan, but our experience at this location was aweful. - Server was excellent, friendly and helpful. - 2/2 coffee mugs sent back with lipstick stains (not ours) - tea service complete with hair. - food took 45 minutes (not busy) - french toast was raw (literally uncooked egg soaked bread) - crepes were stone cold (like stale tortillas) - sausage included multiple hairs - eggs were cold - we were splashed with dirty water while bus-girl wrung out her cloth.  Had to walk out. Very sad. wanted Cora's. This location has some serious problems though."}
{"text":"Apparently this place is great in Montreal so was franchised here. It's very busy and food takes a while to arrive. Premium prices are charged for a mediocre breakfast (the fruit garnish doesn't justify the cost of an otherwise average at best breakfast)"}
{"text":"I had never had a great breakfast experience at Cora's until I visited this location.   Our server was Tarah and she was AMAAAAAZING! I was brunchin' with a friend that I hadn't seen in two years and not once did we feel rushed. We caught up at our leisure and shut the place down, and even then, the staff was more than friendly and more than happy to let us stay for as long as we wanted.  The food was excellent and the staff was on top of everything; so much as though the coffee in our mugs never even receded below the halfway mark.  Because I have a serious gluten allergy, Tarah was happy to offer suggestions on how to best customize my meal for the best price.  To add, there were paintings of animated breakfast foods all over the walls and this made for a very friendly and happy environment.  I loved everything about this Cora's. From the service to the setting, this place could not have been better brunch experience."}
