{"text":"This was fun. I used a Groupon so I didn't buy any extra credits but we had enough creds and a big playground to play for a solid couple hours. Being pregnant I can't go on the bumper cars or laser tag but I was able to relax while she ran around and made friends. Plus the Groupon came with a whole pizza and drinks for us. Nice indoor area will be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  It's a great value and it really can be fun for all ages. If you notice, all of the complaints are from \"those types of parents\" who think the world should accommodate their snowflake children. As far as security measures, only Chuck e cheeses stamps hands. PPP, main event, Dave and Buster's do not have any precautions set in place either. If your child is too young to know not to run out of the front door, you should be one step behind them anyway. Older kids should know better. Btw there is an unlimited pass and my kids have had hours of fun using them. If your child is too young to trust with the card...again, you should be there to swipe for them anyway. If your child is 9 and bored here, your child is lame, and probably would rather be plopped on the couch playing video games. Get over yourselves please."}
{"text":"Super fun! Took my 3 year old and we had a blast. Place is super clean and well thought out. So nice it feels like it should be in Scottsdale. We live in the area and it's great to finally have something to do with our kid that isn't Peter Piper. I was also really surprised how much fun I had in the laser tag. I think I had more fun than my daughter ha. Oh and they have thrifty ice cream! That definitely brought back some great memories of my childhood. Definitely recommend and great to have such a nice facility in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is fun for kids.  I took my son and three of his friends there for his birthday and they loved the laser tag.  Unfortunatly because I didn't have a birthday party scheduled (min of 10 kids and $250 charge) we weren't able to bring in a small cookie cake to sing him happy birthday.   You can only bring outside food in if you have a scheduled party.  So it would be a good place if you are planning 10+ kids then you can have the entire birthday experience including a cake."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for the kids to let go of some energy.  However the employees are what really turned me off.  One in particular was very rude to our 5 year old and acted to good to even listen or say hi. Only time she seemed to enjoy her job was when it came to the rules.   She was on them like a cheap suit.  Working at a kid place you would think you would hire employees who like kids.  just sayin"}
{"text":"Really fun for kids! Lots of things to do although the cost adds up quickly here. It was extremely busy when we visited and we were told pizza was an hour and a half wait, so we can't speak to how the food is. I'd have to agree with another reviewer in that the prizes are minimal and any decent ones require a LOT of tickets. The ball area was awesome and definitely has a good variety of play areas. The staff at the front desk were very nice and helpful.
We'll be back!"}
{"text":"It took me 6 months to find time to take my kids here. They enjoyed it, nice having quite a few options for them to enjoy all while I got to sit down and watch with them nearly always in eyesight. I had high hopes about being able to go in summer for indoor entertainment. Unfortunately the customer service is abysmal. First while there a kid (very young) ran off with my daughters card... we only had one attraction pass left anyway so we just decided to call it quits. 

A week later I reviewed my bank statement only to find they charged me twice for the same transaction. I called, the young man who answered tried to transfer me to whom I assumed was a manager... it was a complete stranger who wasn't thrilled to be asked about a duplicate transaction. I was yelled at, then hung up on. I called back only to be asked for my credit card number so they could look into it. I will not give a teenager my card number over the phone. I asked him to just have the manager call me. Which he did at 8 pm at night. He was very disrespectful, reiterated that I needed to provide my card number or come back in  (its 30 minutes from my house. When I said that it was ridiculous that he had no way to reverse his mistake. He said he didn't do anything to me... he was the General Manager and wasn't the one who charged the card twice. Not once was there a \"sorry for the inconvenience\"...."}
{"text":"This will be our new go to indoor play place for the oncoming summer months and likely through out the year. This place has it all, the play structures are safe, fun and very clean. The cafe left nothing to be desired with fair prices and tasty food and treats! Oh, and they have Thrifty Ice Cream :) for 1.50 per scoop! The arcade has an array of high quality games you would actually want to placy and there are plenty of games and activities for all ages..... even on a busier Saturday. My children are 2 and 6. The staff was friendly and we left so excited about our next return visit! I love that this is a family owned local establishment which takes pride in the quality/safety over quantity. Thank you, thank you!"}
{"text":"We love coming here!  They have trampolines, laser tag, bumper cars and arcades.  It's a must for summer fun.   They also have a play center.  They also have a cafe with food.   You're not allowed to bring any kind of drink or food but it's ok.  The cafe has pizza to slushes.  Kids will enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"This place has potential but needs improvement in a few areas. There are zero measures in place to protect the entrance from kids getting out or someone trying to walk out with your kid. Most kids places give everyone the same stamp, or a bracelet with all the same number. It's better to have something in place before something bad happens. When you have a fairly small building with 100's of kids running around it's easy for them to be out of your site for a moment. I would have felt much better knowing measures were in place to protect children. 

The ball zone area has two slide exits where the kids are then outside of the ball zone and on there own. In the short time we were there I noticed young children coming out of the slide and then confused how to get back into the area. They could have easily wondered off while the parent was on the opposite where the seating area is. A easy solution would be designing the play area with one way in and the same way out. That way you know there is only one place your kids can come out. Add the fence/netting around the slides. 

We paid for the 5 attractions pass with $10 to the arcade. No Employee ever swiped our card at any of the attractions. Therefor, if I had not prepaid it would have been free. I'm sure regulars to Whipples have figured this out. 

The tickets to arcade game costs ratio was really bad. We spent a total of $30 in the arcade and got 400 tickets. I know that these places don't have the nicest toys but Whipples had the cheapest selection of prizes for the kids. It's not the 80's, what kid wants those 1 cent green army guys nowadays? Get modern and at least make it somewhat worth it. My kids spent all that time playing to win tickets and redeem fun prizes. After looking at the selection they literally were interested in nothing.

Whipples totally misses the mark. We drove about 40 minutes to visit and highly doubt we will do that again. Such a bummer."}
{"text":"Fun... not a lot of supervision though in the slides and such I went in there and supervise most of the time and kids were using those guns and shooting me in the head with themother than that it was great and the food was not that bad considering pesto pizza was very good I would just lighten up with the cheese"}
{"text":"A ton of fun for the kids! They have different areas of play, and kids older than 6 will definitely enjoy them all, so I'd say, if your kids are 6 and up, take advantage of their 1-hour unlimited play ($15/per child) or 2-hour unlimited play ($25/per child). My kids are 7 and 9 and I wish I had done that, today, rather than buying the options separately. I'll definitely buy unlimited play next time. It was our first time and the kids had a blast! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My 4-year old grandsons have a blast here. 
Fun place to burn off some energy on the trampolines (which are individual) or in the multi-level climbing area. 
Management is friendly, it is clean, and there is food available for
kids and adults.
If you haven't gone yet, you should try it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fun experience for kids, this place is fantastic all around! I would compare this place to peter piper pizza except that it is a much better experience. It is family owned, has a helpful and kind staff, and is very clean. The cafe was very nicely kept and had good food options, the gluten free pizza was actually very tasty and my picky daughter ate 4 entire slices! It was a rainy weekend and I wanted to take my 5 year old somewhere indoors where she could have fun but also get some exercise. Arcade games, a fun play place in the center, slides, bumper cars, trampoline and Lazer tag! The only small thing I would change is that there should be more prizes for girls, my daughter had accumulated a lot of tickets but could not find any prizes that she liked as the larger prize options were all for older boys. Otherwise it was very fun."}
{"text":"Gross they had mold in their cheese and the \"general manager\" was such a douche. He was unprofessional, very cocky and did not try to come up with any type of solution, rather then kick my entire family out and give us our money back."}
{"text":"We visited for the $5 weekday special. It's all you can play in Ballocity and trampolines from 11-3. It's the perfect time for younger kids to have the run of the place without being trampled by older ones. My 3 year old thought it was a really fun place.
The staff here is excellent. They play with and engage the kids and make the experience very fun. 
The food is decent and reasonably priced. The guy that works cafe is so friendly and helpful. He frequently asked if we needed anything and quickly corrected a minor problem with our order."}
{"text":"This place was great! The staff was outstanding. Everyone one had a blast, not just the kids but even the parents said it was the most fun they had ever had at a kid Birthday party. Awesome Place!"}
{"text":"We'd heard about Whipple's from a friend and decided to check it out for my almost 10 yo's birthday.  My boys, ages 11, almost 10 and 8 had a blast.  The spin/ bumper cars are in a little bit of a small area but are really unique.  They look almost like bumper boats or a hovercraft.   My wife and I were laughing watching the boys spin and hit each other.

Next was lazer tag.  Couldn't see it, but the boys reported 2 floors and quite fun.  

Then they went to ballocity.  Only place I've seen like this was in Legoland in Carlsbad.  You shoot foam balls at each other.  It's always crowded at Legoland and the boys would have spent hours in there.

The trampolines were last and I bet the boys will be tired tonight.

While watching the boys, I had a scoop of chocolate malted crunch thrifty ice cream.  

The employees were helpful and friendly.  The place is very clean.

One thing to note is you'll want socks and closed toe shoes.  Without those, your child won't be able to participate in all the entertainment."}
{"text":"Great place for the fam and birthdays. Super clean and the whole staff is nice and helpful. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing, took three boys there ranging from ages 6 to 11.  The staff kept them engaged with going from the bumper cars to laser tag to whatever they wanted to do.  The trampolines are individual so you don't have to worry about your little ones getting injured.  The ballocity didn't keep the big kids occupied that long, but it's fantastic for the little ones.  During the week it's definitely stay at home mom time, they bring their little ones pay 6 dollars and they can play in ballocity all day if they want.  Did I mention the amazing staff, they really take it to the next level of customer service.  They even noticed when one kid was a little pouty and quickly got him involved in a fun activity.  Already have plans to come back.  Also the place has a nice open concept and only one non emergency regular entrance and exit which is in full view of pretty much everywhere, you can watch your little one play while the bigger ones run around with the staff.  Have no complaints and got my money's worth."}
{"text":"Kids had a blast, pizza is great and when you go to redeem tickets they actually have excellent prizes for reasonable tickets. I love this place and it will be our new spot!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to bring the kids when it's to hot to play outside. Reasonably priced. All the games worked. Will be coming back often."}
{"text":"Place is nice & clean! Large & pretty fun. My kids are 9 & 12 so unamused by some things.. They hated the trampolines (no flips allowed) but loved the bumper cars & went wild over the laser tag! Games are fun, food is good & I don't believe this place is overpriced at all."}
{"text":"We came to celebrate my nephew's birthday today and was told after calling to confirm on Friday it's ok to have a cake even if it's not in the party room. Then we placed the ice cream cake in the freezer...still was not told at the front desk. Then, after trying to let the cake thaw for a bit to make it easier to cut we were told that we couldn't have a cake. So after complaining we were told we could then eat it but could not sing, light a candle, or draw attention to the cake. So ridiculous...who doesn't allow a cake for a kids birthday? I don't recommend this place for a birthday. Unless you want to be scolded by the owner after an employee tells you it's ok and deal with an owner that has no customer service skills."}
{"text":"This place was fun for my 7 year old and a friend from out of town.  The laser tag was fun, but stuffy.  We will definitely be back, but for the value I would recommend Dave and Busters instead.
For a fun place to let the kid run out her energy, the two hour pass seems like a good deal.  Especially during the summer."}
{"text":"We had our daughters 3yr old birthday party there yesterday with 16 kids ages 2-7 and all of the kids had a blast! All of the parents told us how great the place was, too! Our party host Christiana made everything completely seamless and honestly, made it so much easier on me and my husband. Thank you, Whipples Fun Center! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Strict like your 85 year old grandma. This place has all the makings to be a fun place for families but it falls completely flat. We went there for my middle child's birthday and they stopped us from bringing her presents and tried to stop us from bringing her bottle and our 1 year olds bottle since they \"don't allow outside beverages or food\". I didn't care for a few of the staffs attitude either. Too many rules. Not coming back."}
{"text":"We did my son's bday party there. First, very clean!  Smells great (and you know what I mean). They have a focus on safety, so the trampolines are monitored to make sure 1 kid per and no back flips. It has a nice lay out. Good pizza for a kid place.   The kids liked the laser tag, though my older son(11) was not happy the gun kept telling him to not play rough. Optimal age for enjoyment is 4-9 I'd say. The prizes for the games are good- nice quality and more than you get as compared to other places.   Parents of the party kids commented how nice the place is. 

The party package included drink, pizza, 4 attractions and $5 game play. 25/kid. Extra pizzas were just 13/pie so not bad. Party Room size and set up were not good. Spent 400 total and despite the room next door not being used, they still put up the partition. (Really?). We had three tables for kids and one table for the cake. With a lot of adults and kids, was just too cramped.  Because of that, I can't recommend the party room unless you ask for both rooms, but not sure if that costs extra??

Recommend calling to indicate number of kids as online form just asks if you'll have more than ten kids, then you're stuck with a little room. They need another table for food and drinks. The rooms are very plain, so bring. Few decorations or it just looks blah. 

Staff is attentive and nice. Family owned and operated. Owner was there and very nice."}
{"text":"We held a birthday party here for our 9 year old but most of the kids who attended were friends of our 11 year old son. Everyone had a great time and the price we paid was very reasonable."}
{"text":"The facility was very clean and the staff super sweet. The kids had so much fun especially in the climbing gym and bumper cars. Glad we found this place on Groupon!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorites indoor place ever! I had my son 1st birthday party here, end of May and I had over 25 kids here for his birthday party. Every kid and parent absolutely loved this place. Not one complaint. I had a staff member constantly helping my room and me not asking, he read my mind and knew exactly what to do to make sure the 1) birthday boy is happy 2) his parents are happy and 3) birthday boy guests are happy. The staff member never left our sight and helped with everything. ( cleaning up after the kids, refilling the drinks constantly, etc) I already have invitations for my son to go here in the next few months. The place is clean and they are constantly on top of cleaning. The price is decent and will definitely have my son birthday here again."}
{"text":"My friends and I took our 12 kids here, ages 3-12, and there was something for everybody to do. We took advantage of the 2 hour Thanksgiving special and it was a great deal. The establishment was super clean and the food was really good too. The staff was very helpful and one of the employees, Tristan, was extra awesome in helping us get the best deal and explaining everything to us. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Super fun place for all ages. Owner and manager very professional and take the time to talk to you. Most staff pleasant and kid friendly. Very clean. Little pricey to be going to frequently. Needs more flexibility on what to ride on packages. Unlimited two hour pass for $35/kid is too much especially if you have multiple kids. You can go to an amusement park for just a little more and spend all day. Needs to be more reasonably priced. Laser tag is awesome and my kids favorite."}
{"text":"The whole family loved it!  Perfect for our 6 and 8 year old.  We did the 3 hour unlimited pass for both kids and it was perfect.  My husband and I even enjoyed the bumper cars.  

The staff was incredible."}
{"text":"My toddler absolutely loves this place. It's great to a play place close to home. He always knocks out to sleep after two hours of playing here. Clean and lots of fun obstacles. Not over prices. I highly recommend and hope this place stays open for a long time."}
{"text":"This place is clean and not too big.  However, as others have mentioned, there are no security measures as far as kids running out the door, etc. when I arrived (at opening) there were a couple of workers at the front desk (1 of which had to be at least a manager, if not an owner). I had to get their attention in order to pay.  Kids had to wait 10 min for the bumper cars to be set up--it's not like they open at 6 am!  When I ordered a pizza (included in my Groupon) the gentleman couldn't have cared less.  Not my fault that I bought a groupon and expected to redeem it.  The pizza was mediocre.  Served with only a couple of paper plates.  No napkins or utensils...seems odd since I was with really little kids.  While the games looked new, they ate my money.  They were expensive.  The prizes they offered weren't worth anything.  (Peter piper is better!).  This place is expensive.  The staff don't care if you're there or not.  Definitely better value and more fun at other arcade-kid friendly places."}
{"text":"This place was way more fun than we even expected for Toddler Time! Definitely recommend going if your kiddos are a little shy and need some good kid time, don't be afraid that they won't have fun. Toddler Time is perfect whether they're a crazy hyper playtime kid or more reserved, it will bring the crazy fun out of them! My son loves it here. We have yet to go with all the attractions open but we definitely plan to soon."}
{"text":"Great place for the kids to play. Lots of games and things to do for the entire family"}
{"text":"I took my daughter (who is 11) and her friend Jaida (12) yesterday 9/26/16 and they had a blast.  We played laser tag & we all rode on the bumper cars.  The staff are all very nice, they make sure your having a good time, very friendly & helpful. Matter of fact, it was Christoper who offered to take photos when I would join my girls. He did a good job, I didnt think he would be able to get pics in laser tag, but he did lol.  The laser beam room was cool too & cant forget about the spraying nerf balls area with slide & tunnels & the huge arcade area!
I added a video in the photo section but apparently it only allows a short one, it cut off most of it.  I had taped the kids playing in almost all areas having fun. Including one of the staff members who kept dancing near me & the girls lol 
Cons:  The bumper cars twirled around in circle too much & there was no way to stop it w the controls.   
I understand the concept of wearing socks on the trampoline & playing area, but there should be a flashing sentence on the website: NEED Socks. We had to pay $2.00 for a pair.
It was $22.00 for one hour for each person, so getting 3 cards cost 66 plus tax.   I got ice cream for the 3 of us with 3 bottled waters. It was $15.00. It seemed a little steep to me, but then most amusement places are.
Many times going to these places, I bring my laptop & do my writing, none of the benches had backs to them, which would be hard to relax while trying to type. Putting the cons aside, I felt like the 50 minute drive over there was worth it :)"}
{"text":"We attended a kids Birthday party at Whipples this past Saturday night. Our daughter and other party goers had a VERY good time. Lots to do for all ages. The place is super clean. The staff is friendly, and helpful. They have 2 large TV's so parents can watch sports games while the kids play. Very family friendly!"}
{"text":"Best Lasertag in the state! Surprisingly good food for a kid playland. Im also still amazed at how clean the place is each time i go because of the number of kids that go through there. They also have a few adult drinks to soothe parents now, lol"}
{"text":"It was our first visit and definitely won't be our last. The staff was great and patiently took their time to explain procedure. Kids had a blast! Super clean and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Pretty fun place for kids. Lots of different activities. They have a play structure thing with slides, bumper cars, trampoline, laser tag, and arcade games. Admission price is not very expensive."}
{"text":"They have $5 play from 1130-330pm and it was awesome. I took our younger three boys (2, 4, and 7) and they had a blast. Definitely will come back with the older kids for a family night soon."}
{"text":"Came here from a recommendation from one of my friends. My kids had a blast, the management was outstanding and the place has a very great atmosphere to it. I will be bringing my kids here more frequently now that we have visited the place. Thank you guys for making my first time visit outstanding!"}
{"text":"This is a great alternative to Peter Piper Pizza and other chain pizza/arcade places.  Downside is that is was really expensive and not something I could afford to do all the time.  I still really enjoyed it though.  The food was delicious and the staff was friendly and helpful.

My oldest said he didn't like the arcade games too much.  Thinking back on our visit, I understand why he would feel that way.  There wasn't many games suited for his age (5).  I tried to get him to play in the ball area and the jungle gym but he refused.  Same with the trampoline.  Sigh, there went my money down the drain for the toddler pass for him.

My youngest at least enjoyed the ball area though, yay!  Overall, I would recommend this place for some good old family fun."}
{"text":"We went here for a birthday party recently and had really mixed feelings about it. As others have mentioned, there are zero security measures at the front door. They have some neat stuff, much of it can be found at other places (trampolines, laser tag, bumper cars, laser maze), but some of it is unique (ballocity playground). The prices for individual attractions seemed really high. It's unfortunate that you can't purchase unlimited play for x number of hours. You have to swipe a card for each attraction for each kid, which is a bit obnoxious to keep track of and my kids are too small to trust with a card by themselves. The laser tag room had no tv's in it, so you either have to go in to monitor your kids or send them in and hope for the best. The employees were ok, not overly friendly or impressive. Everything seemed pretty clean and all of the games were functioning, but it's only been open a few months at this point. Overall, our kids enjoyed it, but at the price point I'm not sure we'd come back much as we also have Pogo passes for similar amusement parks."}
{"text":"Really great for kids 8 and under! We just had my daughters 7th birthday there and her and her friends had a lot of fun! It would be great to come here during the summer when it's to hot and the kids need something to do :)"}
{"text":"Great place for kids!! Lots of fun things to do! Kids had a blast and the pizza was great too!!! Loved the many different attractions! Thank you for the great indoor place to take kids."}
{"text":"Clean, safe , fun  , family owned and operated , check it out!  I like the facility as a whole. Adults will even enjoy the laser tag."}
{"text":"It's nice for kids 3 and up really and the bumper tubes were nice but the service and food were not good at all. The staff is young and very immature and not very helpful. But it's worth to check it out and see for yourself."}
{"text":"This place is great!  All of my kids and my nephew loved it, and they range in age from 2 to 12. It's hard to find something that will keep them all entertained, but this place fit the bill. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So I have only been here twice and I have younger children so we don't get as much out of this place as an older child would. First off the employees were so rude and this place so so unorganized granted there seemed to be a couple of summer school program field trips entering at once so a bit chaotic. My other issue is it's pay per attraction which having multiple children can add up quick !!!! For toddlers there's an attraction called ballocity and the trampolines but that's it the trampolines you can only have one child in at a time which seemed ridiculous in my opinion trying to get my 2 yr old son not to bounce with his sister was no easy and make our experience unpleasant. I would recommend this place more for kids 6 & up so they can take advantage of the cool things like bumper cars and laser tags looks like fun !!! They also have a nice seating area with a cafe place that servers pizza I didn't eat there but many people looked like they were enjoying it."}
{"text":"My two-year-old little boy had fun The Place is very clean But a bit pricey They had a lot to offer the little ones"}
{"text":"A little bit pricey for as small as it is. But ended up being worth it. I like that there's a bar, and a rule that if you're drinking you can no longer participate. Best part is that grownups can join the play!"}
{"text":"\"It's clean, fun, and everything works. I can't complain\". -The husband  I subtracted a star because of the complicated and expensive sort of pricing. You can't just walk-in and do everything. We were offered the opportunity to walk around and decide what we wanted to do and return to the desk to pick our package. I'm not even sure what we ended up with but we did arcade games, the bumper cars, the trampoline, and ball areas. It is easy enough to add money to your card in a machine which we did multiple times (it's easy to go crazy $$$). 

The tickets load directly onto your card also which is convenient but my kiddo was a little sad when the game didn't spit out her winnings. She seemed fine once we explained they were all on her card and how many she won each time. 

A little more of an old school arcade feel and I would have given a 5. It was still a very fun afternoon for us and the 4 year old ."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  There are so many activities for all ages. The playground was so much fun to play with the kids! The arcade games are all great too. They have bumper cars and trampolines. Literally everything.  Did you go to Jungle Jims growing up? 
Is like that but better. I can't wait to throw my kids next birthday party here.  

Highly recommend!  

The prices are great too. They have mid day specials on weekdays that are totally reasonable."}
{"text":"This place rocks! State of the art electronics and friendly fabulous staff! So fun even for adults"}
