{"text":"Fun Irish pub smoking section where you can drink,,., great drink specials. . Good food"}
{"text":"An unusual place ... BUT A LOT OF FUN   Pool Tables, Darts, 2 Megatouch, and Touchtunes, and Buzztime.  Food is good, TUES is Wing day 50cent min 6 dine-in only. Several different beers on tap and in bottles.   Bartenders are cute and friendly.  Place is always busy.  This place has a smoking patio that is completely covered and is very near the bar.  A roll-up garage door is usually open.   I always have a good time, even though it's Irish in name only"}
{"text":"Love this place! Cheap beer in tall frosty mugs, great bar good, I recommend the carne asada quesadilla or fingers and fries tossed in wing sauce. A dive for sure, but and although they're always short staffed, bartender and the cook do an outstanding job. Took my co-workers there yesterday for happy hour and they loved it!"}
{"text":"My boy Drewy found this side hole for us to lye low one night from a possible DUI . The wings got us filled even though Buster had way to much to drink so much for our D.D. F.C. Yup this place is low key, you can hide ur ride in the back just be sure to back it inso ur plates don't get run.."}
{"text":"Amazing food but the service is what makes this place a level above. The bartender Shannon is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Love this bar. All the bartenders are amazing. The food is delicious. Great specials."}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here anytime that I have the time. Justine and Hope are my favorites. Food here is also so good!"}
{"text":"Definitely the BEST wings in Phoenix.  Huge selection of flavors too.  The other food is also good, but I go out of my way to come in the for the wings.    Its a dive bar for sure, but very comfortable and safe.  Lots of regulars.  Sometimes the staff is stretched a little thin, but other than that - Awesome.  My husband loves it so much, he's on their pool league."}
{"text":"Their wings are really good, maybe the only good thing left about this place, they could really use more staffs because not enough to service you and they are over worked. And I always find the ATM is out of service. This place use to be different and better. But will come back once in awhile to check back on them."}
{"text":"On thursday (10-27-16), at roughly 4:45 pm. The bar tender (female, long dark hair) was taking the order from 3 people in our group. All 3 of us were making large orders, all with special requests. We were not simply ordering \"the burger\"... we were ordering different kinds of foods and toppings, salads or potatoes with or with out the extras, medium/medium well, etc. its a lot to try to remember when there are 3 different orders, and the bartender was not writing anything down.   She took my 2 friends orders, and by the time she had gotten to me, i asked her if she was sure she \"didnt want to write this stuff down\" and she snapped back at me by saying \"are you fucking kidding me? I have a lot of customers. Can you just tell me what you want?\"... i was shocked and said i dont want anything, im fine, dont worry. She then continued to attack me by saying \"now your fucking insulting me. Tell me what you want\". I told her that i dont want anything, im fine, this will be my last beer.  She walked away, and my 2 friends were asking me \"what was that all about\". I explained to them how she swore at me twice. The bar tender over heard me and said \"i can say what ever the fuck i want\". I told her i would be letting the owner know how she was acting and what she had said to me and she responded by saying \"go ahead. The owner will 86 your ass because i can do what ever the fuck i want\".   I offered to pay for my drinks and leave, she wouldnt let me pay.   This place is usually a pretty decent place. They tend to get your food order wrong, but if you can get past that, its a decent little pub. I will never return to this place, and neither will my group of friends. Not as long as the people who work there are allowed to talk to customers in such a way.  HORRIBLE SERVICE"}
{"text":"I went to O'Brien's Saturday night after hanging out at the Rogue West for a bit. We were more than curious because there was live music coming from the place all night. We caught the last band of the night and it was so much fun. $1 Pabst and friendly bartenders. the crowd was a mixture of younger hipsters to older regulars and everyone there was friendly. It's nice when you can walk into a place and feel welcomed! I would check it out again."}
{"text":"Good to great bar food in my opinion. Always come out fast and without issues. Shrimp tacos and sliders are my favorites. Nothing fancy but great for a quick affordable meal. Biggest complaint about the bar itself is how pitch black it is inside the bar. I wouldn't dare sit inside"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last four years an this is hands down the best place on this side of town!!  Great food for a bar an FANTASTIC STAFF!! It has only improved in the past couple of years. The trash is out an good people are in!! Change the bartender change the clientele!! This place has changed for the better in my opinion! Some crappy bartenders have been replaced an it was for the better! If I wasn't standing in the bartenders face I would never get a drink, I kept coming back for the food!  But now its a great! Service and all!  The bartenders are professional an can handle large crowds under pressure! Its nice to know bartenders can still be in a great mood and handle their business! If you rate this bar any thing less than 4 stars you have clearly never been in the restaurant business, this isn't an easy job to do by any all accounts! Andrea an Stevi are my #1 on Fridays nights! I never feel  unwelcome like I have been in the past with the other crappy bartenders that no longer work here!!  I will continue to come here for the food an the staff!  Its my home away from home!!  Keep up the good work O'Brien's!!"}
{"text":"Divey and dim, right up my alley! Lots of seating and an enclosed outdoor area that feels like you are inside and outside at the same time. Their wings were delicious! Seems like a popular local staple!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to go and drink after work and on your days off hell my friend Kyle goes every night. I haven't  ordered any food but my mother who is very picky tells me the food is excellent. Damn all this talk about it makes me want to go now."}
{"text":"I love this place. This bar ends up being my husband and I's date night favorite. It's close to our home, there is an inside-ish air conditioned patio where we can smoke, the beers are big and ice cold and they even have shuffle board.  The juke box is loud and always on point. Sure it's a little \"dive\" that truly is not in any way an authentic Irish pub but they don't shove the fact that they're an Irish bar in your face. It's a great place to grab a few ice cold beers, eat some of the CRAZY AMAZING wings, and relax."}
{"text":"Bomb wings but slow service. Took forever for the food to come out and service was not that great at all.  **updated- I haven't been here in sometime (3-4 years) but a friend of my had a bday get together here so I decided to give it another chance and I am glad I did. The bartenders (especially Lindsey) were amazing and our food came out pretty fast and the burgers were great. I am really glad I gave this place another shot!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with the chef here!! Had the surf & turf Thursday special and it easily is as good as Durant's or JG Steakhouse. Started out with a nice size salad with BC dressing (which is amazingly good)..nice greens mix not cheap iceberg lettuce, the addition of blue cheese crumbles was a nice touch. The main entree was a flat iron steak like no other, very tender and juicy...no steak sauce necessary!! Also, 10 or so grilled shrimp on a stick..really good flavor!! Great service from the bar as usual..."}
{"text":"very busy but good waitstaff. Food is pretty awesome esp the wings in like 50 flavors i think! i like the sweet thai.the porch is hot but its like a smoking section of the bar because its fully enclosed. the bars AC is awesome though inside. fun atmosphere. Had two incidents that were race and religion inspired but the cowards running their mouths were quieted down by the waitress or another lady so it really went nowhere.. could have been ugly though. otherwise cool peeps fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Though I am not such a fan of Irish pubs this bar is pretty cool.  Pool tables, lots of beer choices and a laid back crowd. I do wish they played better music.  The wings there are good. That is about all I have eaten.. well that is all I remember what is tastes like. Mostly we would show up there after we had already been drinking.   Yep.. this bar is ok.. more men than ladies so be prepared for that!"}
{"text":"Food is shockingly good for the place it is. It isn't Irish though, more like regular bar.   It isn't exactly a friendly place to eat, it's really a bar, but that's fine. It's delish food. The people are a bit sketchy at times."}
{"text":"A friend of mine told me that his best friend played in a band (Disaster Services was the name) and that they were going to be at this bar. I was a little leery at first as the neighborhood isn't exactly the best, but by no means bad.  So I dropped down there, which was a bit of a drive from Avondale. I pulled in behind the bar, where all of the parking was. The parking lot is laid out in a somewhat confusing manner that leads me to believe that those who end up driving with a few too many in them may see headlights in front of their car as they try to navigate the layout. I wouldn't consider it discouraging though, as long as you pay attention to the arrows on the ground. Pretty self-explanatory.  So I went inside, and the builders seemed to have a nice floor plan in mind, save for the bathrooms being in the same hall as the front entryway. The bar is in a sort of tophat shape and past that are a series of high-top tables. The seating on the patio was a sort of bar-like countertop on one side and some shorter but wider tables as well as tables suitable for 2-4 people.  I remember seeing three pool tables and a jukebox (which was not in use for the band's sake) and the ever common but never boring video game screens on the bartop. Just as with most bars these days they had multiple LCD TVs showing sports and poker games.  The service was great. I sat at a hightop thinking I'd be sitting there for a little while until I met the server, but one of the bartenders came by almost immediately. She was one of three there that night and all of them were quick to take my order and as friendly as could be. They claim \"No one under 21, and we card!\" and they weren't lying.  They have lots of beer on tap and also claim to have the best wings in Phoenix. I can't say if they were THE best in Phoenix, as I haven't tried many wings out here, but the wings were excellent and complemented my Kilt Lifter rather well.  Overall, I can certainly see myself heading to O'Brien's many more times again. Oh, and that band, Disaster Services, played a great show! I don't know if they play there often, but if you like Classic Rock, 80's Rock, 80's Pop, Motown, and really interesting medleys of the genres, it might be well worth an evening to check out the bar and the band (should they be playing)."}
{"text":"Calling this an \"Irish Pub\" or \"Sports Bar\"  might be a stretch... But I will let it slide due to the awesome diviness of this joint. They do have a HUGE selection of cheap tap beers, all kinds of various liquor, and basic wine. It's a \"park in the back\" run down looking bar that gives you a slight feel of uncertainty when getting ready to open the door. I'm sure glad we did, though! A dive for sure and mainly male patrons. Lots of seating, dim lights, and some good country music playing on the jukebox. They have a massive \"outdoor\" patio, but it felt like we were still inside. Reminded me of an Arizona room. Spoke to a couple nice, layed back fellows and felt safe and comfortable. The drinks were cheap and cold. The bartender's here kick ass! They are funny, sassy, fast and efficient chicks. Impressive for sure. They seemed to know everyone by name, their drink of choice, and what happenings were going on in their lives. Onto the food...Yum!!! I had a stellar double decker grilled cheese that was hot and cooked to perfection. The hub had wings and loved them.  Our tab was cheap, we heard some hilarious stories, and will definitely be back! I honestly didn't want to leave due to having such an unexpected blast. Don't let the neighborhood or outside exterior intimidate you. Well worth taking that deep breath and walking in the back door for a fun night."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Only had one bartender and no server. Had to order drinks two at a time just to keep my whistle wet. They really need a waitress to run the floor. It's clear that one person can't handle the entire bar on their own."}
{"text":"I have been a patron of this establishment for many many years and have watched it steadily decline.  It has declined so much to the point that I will no longer come here.    The good: And the only reason I gave it one star is the wings.  Otherwise it would get zero stars from me.  The bad:  Where do I begin?  There is honestly nothing 'Irish' about this place.  The sign in front of the bar on 35th Ave says Obriens Irish.  The bar is located in a sketchy area without a doubt.  The place is worn and old looking inside and out.  Parking is horrible!  Trying to get in and out is a constant challenge.  One time my vehicle was a hit and run victim while parked in their parking lot. Of course no one would own up to it or leave a note with contact info.  Very little women ever come in this place which is not suprising considering the unwelcoming aura.  I have steadily watched the clientelle go downhill over the years.  This place now seems to attract a large majority of low lifes.    Graffiti in the bathrooms, people smoking inside the bar when the bar has a patio for smoking, not enough staff to handle the flow of customers or to correct problems effectively, a cook/waiter/bouncer/jack of all trades named Matt that seriously needs to work on his people skills, a pregnant bartender that you feel bad for who is overworked because of the short staff, one of the owners Al is another one that needs to seriously work on his people skills.... I could go on and on but I am sure you get the point.  Gone are the days of bartenders like Dawnelle and Jill.  Gone are the days where you could go in and recognize people you have seen there before who know your name and you know theirs.  Gone are the days of a variety of food specials.  Gone are the days of this bar having the feeling of you honestly being able to say to yourself  \"this is my bar or I LOVE THIS BAR!\"  Gone are the days of you being able to tell your friends and family what a great place it is.  Now this place is just a serious dive with little to no redeeming qualities.  I honestly think that even Jon Taffer could not rescue this bar."}
{"text":"I will NEVER go back to an establishment where the Owner is SO DISRESPECTFUL to a Disabled Vet ONLY because the Vet has a Service Dog!!! ONLY because the Vet has a Service Dog, The Owner came out Screaming at him and Kicking BOTH of them out Absolutely NO OTHER REASON!!! After witnessing that, I will NEVER go back!!!"}
{"text":"Nice and low key. Good food but they don't book very good bands. Mainly metal or cover bands. Their Thursday ladies night is great. It's top-notch as far as dives go. And I love my dive bars."}
{"text":"Came for a drink after work before I went home to surprise and was told that if was going to pay by debit that I would have to spend $10 minimum. Why can't you pay for what you order regardless of what type of payment you use. Normally I would drink more than $10 worth but today happened to be a day that I can't stay long. And to top it off I asked if I could pay with cash for my one drink with cash, which you can but, the ATM was out of service... Normally I don't care but that I did..."}
{"text":"My only issue with this place is with who had control of the jukebox. Played a bunch of songs and they straight skipped 5 of them. Not played over by play now but straight skipped them. Heard all 5 come on for about 5 seconds and then heard them all get skipped. Asked the bartender why my songs got skipped and she acted like the only way that could happen is if someone played now. I said how come every song came on for 10 seconds before getting skipped. If you know TouchTunes you know songs you play over don't start before getting skipped they just go further down the line."}
{"text":"I have lived in Phoenix most of my life but had never lived in 'Dirty Phoenix' (West PHX east Glendale) as I call it and in the last year bought a house literally down the street from the place. So my first month in the house I am driving around finding where all the grocery stores are and such and drive right by this place called O'Brien's. It looked like a cool little dive bar which is my kind of place.   O'Brien's is my hang out now. I love the place, the bartenders are all very cool and very quick with my favorite drink..Capt-n-Coke and the food is really good. Its not too big and not too small and you get all kinds inside. its not just a biker bar, or gay bar or metal bar..its just a good bar. Justine, Kat, Hope and Tara are awesome."}
{"text":"Whose **** do I need to suck to get a drink around here ?  Oh joy. The owner's.  The tired bartenders are over worked and under staffed. When they aren't being molested by their boss they may have time to service you.  This is too painful a scene, which could very well lead to more drinking..  Fortunately, I have money to purchase a drink, so Ill be at Hideaway West."}
{"text":"Crap ! Don't go here ! Unless you want the best cheeseburger in Phoenix. Watch out burger king, mover over Texas Roadhouse. O'Brien's is here, get it with tatter-tots and a cold beer !  Shoot some pool and hangout with friends and if you smoke, the smoking porch is great ! Great jams, just a little loud. You won't notice after ten 7&7's. Party ! And the cute 'sweet' little bartenders get nicer as they get to know you...Enjoy AZ @ O'Brien's"}
{"text":"O'Briens is a top notch neighborhood dive bar.  Don't expect anything too classy, but the food is good and after a few visits, the bartenders will know your drinks, and probably your names.  It's a busy after-work stop, so it can get crowded on certain days of the week.  Pretty great place to watch a game, play some pool or shuffleboard, and hang out with friends. Smoking section is awesome.  I don't smoke, but this smoking section keeps the smell of smoke out of the non-smoking side without segregating the smokers to some nether world away from the rest of us.  Perfect compromise for a bar environment."}
{"text":"Our weekly work happy hour spot! Trish is the best. Good food, Reuben is our favorite. Anyone looking for a low key place to have decent food & drinks at even better prices, this is your spot."}
{"text":"This is a great dive bar that is very laid back and easy going. The staff is great and the people are super friendly. The bar food is awesome and is priced really good. There are a couple of pool tables, video machines and dart boards. The music is at a level that is just right."}
{"text":"I love this dive bar! I've been coming here for years now and the servers are all so friendly. I love getting the hot wings and fries for something to munch on and the drink specials are great! Fun place to just hang out , listen to music and play some pool or shuffleboard!"}
{"text":"Usually a regular here, but after tonight we will not be back. I have never witnessed such unprofessional and lack of az state law and federal law. Group of veterans were here enjoying the night. Not bothering anyone, I was not part of this group just a bystander but what I witnessed was just a sad excuse for an owner of an establishment.  One vet came in with a service dog CLEARLY MARKED as such. The owner came out aggressively stating the dog needed to go. When several people spoke up stating he is a service dog to a veteran he stated \"I don't give a f*ck the dog needs to go and they can go serve their country elsewhere!\" Things got very heated over the next few moments. Someone from my group went to speak with the owner calmly to explain that the man was a vet and the dog was a service dog at which point the owner got in his face yelling of animal cruelty. For one the dog was in no distress, very content, and quietly taking by the side of his vet. Secondly these dogs are trained to be in establishments full of people. They are there to offer assistance to their owner. I think this owner needs to read az and federal state laws stating they MUST COMPLY with these laws. Thinking someone needs to report him. Sad an establishment we enjoyed visiting is run by someone like this. We will not be back, the staff and food are great I have nothing bad to say about them. But I will not support a business that is treats our vets or service animals in this manner.  \"ACCOMMODATION LAW Any person or entity that operates a public place shall not discriminate against individuals with disabilities who use service animals.  Any trainer or individual with a disability may take an animal being trained as a service animal to a public place for purposes of training subject to exceptions in law.  Violation is a class 2 misdemeanor.  Law has exception for zoos or wild animal parks where service animals may come into direct contact with the animals. R. S. § 11-1024\""}
{"text":"This place has what many places don't;  A vibe to mentally zone out.... Some bars are meant to bring out your social side, others your sports side- i found that i can get three important things i like at this place:  1. Guinness on tap   2. Robust authentic environment (nice dark wood styling- old photos and a chilled out staff--- (i feel like i can talk badly about Obama and iphones and not an eyebrow would be raised!)        3.  I can chill and zone out after work and just be quiet."}
{"text":"Stopped by here late on a Sunday night to get some food. Driving in I wasn't expecting much, but sometimes the dirtiest girl can turn out to be a prize.  Make no mistake: this is a dive bar through and through. From the outdated everything inside, to the hidden parking behind the building.   That being said, there were really two things that stood out to me for the short time I was there: the enclosed smoking area and the food.  The smoking area IS a patio, but it is connected to the bar by a roll up garage door, and there is cover and ventilation that make it feel like you are inside. The ventilation pulls the smoke out and keeps the bar from getting a smoke smell throughout. Very cool for those of us who hate being relegated to the alley to smoke under the current smoking laws.  The food here was absolutely fantastic. The wings were 9/10 in both flavors we had (hot and honey hot), the pizza was tasty and made from very high quality ingredients (thick hand tossed crust that is crispy where it counts and light and airy inside). The burgers also looked to be on fresh artisan type buns and my friend who had one said it was outstanding.   All in all, if you like dive bars it's worth a look, especially if you are looking for late at night."}
{"text":"Went for a few drinks... in the evening this time ;) lol it was really relaxing and fun... there was a trash can fire... that was entertaining... the bartender was sweet and cool.. she kept coming over and hung out throughout the night... I only stayed till about 930 on a Tuesday... and it was pretty full for a Tuesday I'd say :) i cant wait to go back for the Halloween party :)"}
{"text":"Went here last night for St Patty's day. No special events or anything crazy. Lively atmosphere but super divey. Probably not the best place to catch any sporting events. Service was pretty slow, but granted it was busy."}
{"text":"The best corn beef and cabbage.  You get a lot of food for the price. It tastes better when you eat it there but so delicious."}
{"text":"It's an amazing bar! Great atmosphere, great people, and the bartenders are amazing! Second Sundays of every month are also amazing because of \"Name that Tune.\" Overall a great place to hang out and relax, definitely recommend to all."}
{"text":"Beer anyone!??!!   Irish pub here guys. The atmosphere is dark with low lighting, most lighting coming from the pool tables. They also provide a back patio area for the smokers that consist of alot of chairs, high tables and festive lights.   I ordered quite a few pitchers of tap beer tasty ShockTop for my group. Service was exceptional, as the bartender present walked around and checked on everyone in the bar. Not just standing behind the bar waiting on others.   I grabbed a menu and ordered wings(all flats- a dollar or 2 charge), they were tasty. They also had well over a dozen choices of flavors to choose from, but be careful some are kind of bootleg. My friend ordered hot wings, the typical hot wings flavor.   My favorite here would have to be the games they provide. Pool tables of coarse, darts and the puck table was full of fun. Games are placed in a nice spot.   Parking is very accessible it's behind the bar, and alot of space.   I would go back to this bar and bring friends here anytime. People that come here are great as well. They welcomed me and everyone was friendly.   Beer and fun anyone?!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My only complaint is the slow service at times, but it doesn't stop us from going. The food is delicious. Everything we've ever ordered has been damn good. Overall, It's a great dive bar with a good beer selection that's worth the slow service at times."}
{"text":"Throwback to 60's / 70s.  Sweet Home Alabama blasting on the jukebox as we made entry into this dive . Don't need no education at this bar.    Ordered some wings and then tried to cancel  when a roach crawled up on the bar, next to the food and drinks.     Ordered 1/3 glass of chardonnay...don't have that here. Ok.  no worries.   double shots of jack next time.   Dark , dingy interior.    Bar stools in  bad shape, as was most of the seating in the area. Moved to a table which also was ready to collapse. Had there been an earthquake recently in Phoenix?      Better believe it, buddy...its ass-whipping time every day at obriens.  A heavy-set (middle-aged lady)  lurched by, shouting vulgarities at the bartender. Time to hit the road...when is the wet t-shirt contest...want to make sure we miss that one. the south will rise again, someday"}
{"text":"I like this place because I always have fun when I go.  But there service is terrible.  It takes forever to get a drink, but the prices are pretty reasonable.  There's always interesting people hanging out.  The music is really loud and there's always an interesting playlist.  You'll hear metal, hip hop, dubstep, classic rock, and indie music all in the first hour of sitting there.  The outer part of the bar is technically a patio so no one has to go outside to smoke which helps when hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"I always had a bias against O'Brien's as the *other* bar on 35th & Northern. Now that it's the only one, and some buddies of mine were playing a show, I finally caved and checked it out. Did not regret.  It's a pretty roomy bar that fits tons of people. I liked the enclosed smoking patio, since my friends didn't have to leave to light up.   The drink specials are groovy. $1 lands you some cheap beer (PBR, I believe) and for $3.50 you'd get a frosty mug of Leinenkugel's Berry Weiss. I can drink that for days! There are tons of cheap shots listed above the bar, and I'll get around to trying them all.  The only downsides were slow service (this place seemed understaffed) and no stage for bands. They just clear some stuff out of the way, and people there to listen to music find themselves bumping into people sitting down watching the game. Feels awkward and disorganized.  But if you get drunk enough, will that really matter?"}
{"text":"The staff is COMPLETELY horrible and unprofessional. I was there this last Friday for a small bite to eat and the staff not only authorized and charged my debit card for my tab, but didn't \"clear\" *as they say* the authorization window and authorized someone else tab that was after me and even after the staff finding my completed receipt with signature which was completed almost TWO HOURS before they charged the other individuals tab who they stated \"walked out on their tab\", refused and I mean REFUSED to to take ownership and correct the issues even though they openly admitted the issues was on there end. I seriously cannot stress enough if you absolutely have to go to this bar (which I would not recommend) DO NOT use your debit card!!!!  Also avoid having Stevie or Veronica as your waitress as they do not seem competent enough to do their job duties and/or be able to multitask."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about 5 yrs now. Best wings in town, can't go wrong with the burgers,pizza, or the fries. The bartenders are friendly. Yes they are short staffed, but for the amount of people working here  they get the job done. The bar crowd is always entertainment; you never know what type of people will come in. Everyone is friendly and keeps to themself.  Good dive bar. If your looking to clean, 5 star food you're in the wrong neighborhood."}
{"text":"All-around great bar.  It may seem a bit dive-y at first, but that's what gives it character right?  Cheap beer, awesome food (especially the wings), hot bartenders, pool, darts, nice patio, live music, Buck Hunter, Golden Tee...this place has it all.    For the most part the girls there are all pretty average, nothing a few beers can't fix.  Depending on what night you go, there's usually a pretty good spread...great place to pull cougars."}
{"text":"This bar is pretty decent and usually has a decent crowd. The price of beer is pretty standard and the staff is okay. The best thing the bartender's have going for them is there pretty good looking. The are not that fast to take an order however. I will say I'd probably be back again so I'll give four stars for now."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall.  Love the bar food here, love the people who work here! My favorites would have to be the medium wings, and the bloody mary. The wings are deep fried in peanut oil and served in a buttery franks sauce.  The bloody mary has a little extra touch, served with a jalapeno soaked asparagus spear.  YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Last Night I went to O'Briens Sports Pub and I entered the kitchen, I saw a few bugs and a kitchen not clean. I was ate wings but I taste weird. Next time I will not back O'Briens Sports Pub."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, fabtastic onion ribs,  Lynyrd Skynyrd to  on the jukebox,  really tasty whiskey and Coke...not sure how life gets better. Oh,  wait,  I know! Buzzfeed tablet trivia, a very comfortable bar where the waitstaff remembers you, and invents drinks for you on the spot, and did I mention the burgers? The bathroom is clean and not scary, the crowd is clean and not scary,  they can make an old-fashioned, there's  a jukebox and pool tables, daily drink specials,  and you aren't spending an arm and a leg for a great evening. Hey, by the way,  order a burger!"}
{"text":"Run of the mill neighborhood bar. Not sure about the food since I've only had the wings, which are okay. They lose a lot of points because of bad service.   I understand management wants to watch labor costs and bartenders/servers want to have as many customers for the tips. This place is always understaffed. Two different times I was here to watch a game with a cold drink and dinner. Both times the bartender was too busy to take my dinner order. This last time I was waving the menu to get her attention and that didn't work. Paid for my beer and left. Went to another nearby bar that had good food and great service.  I was looking for a new neighborhood bar. Ya know...one you would go to several times a week for happy hours and late night fun. Won't be this place."}
