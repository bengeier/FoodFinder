{"text":"Esta bueno el marisco pero no le echan nada son bien pinches codos pa los platas tan caros que venden no vale la pena"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, service, and especially mariscos. Will be my go to place for groups. Definitely will go again. Provecho Genté!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from Instagram and the pics on their ig looked delicious. I'm from the Bay Area so I took advantage I was in town and went to try it out. The food was amazing!!! Las micheladas son una chingoneria!!De las mejores que he probado. I will definately be returning next time I'm in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Best mariscos in Phoenix hands down! No competition around, love this place I can eat this everyday. I've tried a lot of places in Phoenix that people say \"best mariscos\" they do not complace to La Botana, reminds me of Culiacán! Love this place"}
{"text":"I just got served the the best \"aguachile y callo\" that I've had in a while. You can taste that the shrimp and scallops they use are super fresh. The sauce they used was perfect no need to add anything else to it. It's served with red onion, tomato, avocado and cucumber slices. They got a good variety of Mexican sodas, ice cold beer and tequilas. They have a small menu, but I'm willing to bet that everything on the menu is good. I will be back soon. Maybe even tomorrow, so I can try more of the food."}
{"text":"Waitress was rude !! order food with no cilantro and food came with cilantro! waitress had issue with changeing it and never came back to see if we need ot anything else not even to get our bill had to ask another waitress. Good food just really bad service."}
{"text":"Really bad customer service. We were told by a waitress that they had a table ready for us. When we got to the table another waitress told us that, the table was already taken... By ppl whom were already seated. I understand it was busy, but just her attitude sucked. If you're not in it for the customer service don't work in that industry.  El servicio al cliente es horrendo. Cuando llegamos una mesera nos dijo q ya tenía la mesa lista para nosotros. En cuanto llegamos a la mesa otra mesera nos dijo q la mesa ya estaba apartada para alguien más wue de echo ya estaban sentados. Entiendo que está ocupado pero la actitud de la mesera fue inaceptable. Si lo del servicio al cliente no es lo tuyo, no trabajes en esa industria."}
{"text":"Good service. (Even though they seemed short in staff (servers) for a busy night)  Clean!  Great food! I recommend:: Botana tacos (breaded shrimp cheese and steak )  Real in-house made lemonade. Really good!  Tostada torre de botana ( seafood mix tostada :: scallop, cooked shrimp , aguachile, octopus , fish ceviche , avocado onion tomato cucumber ) was really  good  and good portion (I had to share) !  Prices are reasonable.  Music was very loud"}
{"text":"Found the best Mariscos in AZ taste just like CALI Mariscos. I've been looking for a good marisco place and trust me this was the best."}
{"text":"stop by for a quick bite very good micheladas got the kids breaded shrimp with fries of the kids menu our server was just so wonderful and on top of everything ."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! We got a couple of different tostadas and some aguachiles and enjoyed everything! The service was also good!"}
{"text":"Visited la Botana Sunday and I can not say good enough things about their costumer service! From the time we arrived to the time we left the entire staff was friendly and attentive.  For appetizers we had the oyster shots (deliciously prepared with clamato, lime, tajin , black pepper) and Toritos with shrimp (banana peppers stuffed with shrimp and Philadelphia cheese wrapped in bacon)  For entree I had the Camarones Culichi.  Everything was so good! I recommend this place to anyone who wants good food and good service!"}
{"text":"I arrived at this place with my friends and we had the rudest waitress ever, seemed like she hated her life and her job, she came up to us and asked us \"what do you guys want\". Then when we were in the middle of eating she kept trying to hurry us up to leave! The food was good though, micheladas are good too, they just got to hire more friendly staff. Place was also clean."}
{"text":"Bomb tostadas, best I've had in a while! Place is very clean and waitresses are ver tentative."}
{"text":"Not worth it at all. Never brought us chips and salsa, oh that's because they ran out of chips Really! We ordered a bucket of coronas they never brought us limes! We ordered oysters then found out later they were out of oysters! The shrimp cocktail was average in taste smaller than expected for the price! Quesadillas were small. Needless to say we will not be going back.  Oh and we were still hungry so we went to Long Wongs around the corner for wings!!  I will stick to my fav Playa Hermosa!"}
