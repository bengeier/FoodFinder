{"text":"I love Thai food in general & \"9 Thai Kitchen\" made me love it even more. Not only do their restaurant have a really nice, feels like home ambiance, but their food is honestly the best. Their Pad Thai, Eggrolls, & Thai Iced Tea are some of their delicious food that I tried the first time that I went & I had an amazing experience! Their friendly & welcoming staff definitely topped everything off. Definitely would come back again, 10/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"Their Fried rice wasn't the best but I'm sure their other food is good.. we will see. But I'm giving their fried rice a 3 outta 5 it was really dry."}
{"text":"The food is so good especially the chicken satay and the dessert, mango sticky rice. The restaurant decoration is also beautiful too!!!"}
{"text":"I know the owner. I love the fact that most of the food are vegan friendly. And my most favorite part is the decorations are absolutely gorgeous"}
{"text":"This place is very good! I love the food and the servers are very nice and friendly. The atmosphere was nice and cozy. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Amazing food! This is the most amazing pad Thai I've had. My friend got the beef salad and it looked so good I almost ordered one to go haha. I'm excited already to come back next time and i haven't even left the restaurant yet."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and leaves a savoring feeling in your mouth. I really love their Thai tea, it's really sweet and tasty. Their chicken satay is delicious as well, and their padthai. Though the beef is a bit hard, overall it tasted well. The restaurant is clean and nice. Their egg rolls were really hot but that's how you know it's fresh!!  I love the drawings on the walls it gives a nice and warm feeling. It's better than the other Thai restaurant that I tried around china town, much more friendlier as well. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is very nice. Small, chalk drawings on the walls, can dine in or take out.  Food was delicious.  We got Thai Fried Rice with chicken, Vegetable Panang, and Pad Thai with Tofu.  Good sized portions. Nice and quiet. Brand new place that we will definitely visit again as its very close to where I live."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the atmosphere was nice. My favorite was Tom-Yum and Mango sticky rice."}
{"text":"i understand they're a new business, so i get it. but i have some tips.  the food comes out soooooo slow portions are very small (except on the side dishes) and i've given them multiple chances because i work close but every time i ask for more and more spice and there is literally no spice and pretty bland.   i want this place to do well"}
{"text":"Went to have lunch with my husband and two kids here yesterday 06/10/18, we got 4 Thai tea, chicken satay, beef jerky, beef frie rice, chicken pad Thai and larb pork, the bill came out to $75 and some change. Food was food so was the service but I'll probably won't be coming back because it was too pricy. P.s. the beef jerky did not come with dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai little spot. Mom and PA spot with great food! The portion size is filling, Will eat here again for sure!!"}
{"text":"I'm taking a star away because my papaya salad was extremely spicy even though I asked for 1/10 (I'm a wuss). I think the rest of the food was excellent though. The service was top notch (hard not to be, since we were one out of two parties dining there on a Sunday night. I would come back here again, since it's walking distance from my house. Maybe avoid the papaya salad next time."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very aesthetically pleasing and cafe-like and the food was delicious!! I recommend the soft shell crab salad and papaya salad YUM  Also the drawings on the walls are amazing especially in the bathroom. Our servers Fluke and Patty were very friendly and cheerful. Overall, everything was great!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Really enjoyed the food and the casual atmosphere. Thing to order: lemon chicken! It was soooooo good; definitely would go back just to get it. The coconut soup was also so good. Had a really good flavor to it. 10/10 would recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of the better Thai restaurants iv been to in Las Vegas. I recommend the Beef Noodle soup. The best!"}
{"text":"This place was small but really cute and clean! The server was very attentive and helped us decide what to order.  Started off with the egg rolls and they did not disappoint.  They were freshly fried and had really nice flavor.  We ordered the crab fried rice and spicy basil chicken. The rice was my least favorite. It was on the dry side and didn't have as much flavor as I was hoping. The spicy basil was great and had a lot of flavor.  It definitely helped the rice out. There were two of us and that was plenty of food for us. We even had leftovers so I thought they had big servings. I really like their Thai tea. I usually have to ask for extra cream on the side but I didn't have to here because I thought it was perfect. I will definitely be back to try the pad Thai and cashew chicken!"}
{"text":"Had the massaman beef curry and a green chicken curry with a banana fritters with ice cream all super good. The staff was very sweet and attentive. We will be back often ."}
{"text":"Really good thai food,  good vibes ...   little small dinning area, good for the family. I will definitely be coming back again"}
{"text":"Their lunch specials are a good deal considering the price point ($9-10). I had the pad Thai; it wasn't the best incarnation I have had but it was enjoyable and again, reasonably priced for a lunch special. Their spice levels are certainly for Americans though--I ordered a 4/10 and I'd say it was a 1 or a 2, max, on my scale."}
