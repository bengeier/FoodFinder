{"text":"Came here last weekend and it's pretty good dim sum. The har gow, siu mai, and chicken feet are all really plump and juicy. The turnip cakes are huge with tons of shredded turnip rather than mostly dough at some other places. They have the \"goon tong gow\" big seafood dumpling in soup which is great since not a lot of places have it. They also have xiao long baos (listed as Northern style dumplings on the menu) - they're good when they first come out, but after a few minutes they started to get deflated. 

Service is a step-up from your typical Chinese restaurant - the ladies are actually quite friendly."}
{"text":"I am losing count..... 

This location on the 2nd floor inside Oriental Centre has Chinese restaurants opened and closed then opened again.... Little changes with the decor or the set up, difference is just their names...

The Golden Oriental Palace Chinese Cuisine (what a long name!) has dim sum specials with S/M/L $2.30 each Weekdays from 9 AM -11 AM and 1:30 pm to 4:00 pm. 

We got here around 2:30 pm and the place was empty, aside from 3 tables.... not a good sign... This may not be the cheapest dim sum place in Scarborough but we decided to give it a try.

We ordered 6 dishes and found most of them tasted bland and just really disappointing. None of them were good enough to make me go, I will come back next time!

So there won't be a next time for The Golden Oriental Palace Chinese Cuisine... or the next time I come again it maybe under another name already!"}
