{"text":"This is THE best sushi I have ever had. I love John, he's a nice guy and I love his sushi. A friend recommended him to us in the winter and since then, if I can make it out to the St. Lawrence Market area, I'll only go for sushi there. Whenever I want sushi--I automatically thing..\"John's!\"  The first time we went we had EXTREMELY slow service. Our sushi was taking forever and the cook was on the phone....but when it came, oh BOY did I forget the wait! I was literally in Heaven. Since then, I've come back and ordered their $26 sushi platter (affordable for 40 pieces) and the bulgogi roll, spicy salmon and spicy tuna amongst others. The prices are fairly moderate and even on the cheap side of sushi dining, and their green tea ice cream helps digest afterwards.  I always leave there too full to walk, and too satisfied to care. :) A++++"}

{"text":"As a huge sushi fan I have to say that this new place on Front Street is one of the best sushi restaurants I have been to in Toronto and for the price, it's the best deal in town. I would recommend that any sushi fan give it a try. John himself will be there all the time and his attention to quality and presentation are a cut above all places at this price. Favourites that I never go without are the Spider roll as well as the Spicy Scallop hand roll (not on the menu, just ask)"}
