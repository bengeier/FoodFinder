{"text":"Roommate and I went here on Sunday for breakfast. We go to KOS a lot, and Tasty Corner has exactly the same breakfast menu, so we tried it for a change of scenery.

The french toast *was* good, but the service was ruined it. The server was super-confused about our order but wouldn't write it down. Then she came back ten minutes later to confirm our order again, and it was still wrong when it arrived!

When we asked for the bill she asked how we were paying, and left. Later on, we had to ask her for the bill again and she still had to ask again how we were paying. It wasn't even very busy.

There's also a distracting TV and music turned up too loud. We'll stick to the patio at KOS instead."}
{"text":"At Tasty Corner, the curry goat roti is a beautiful thing. It's also fairly massive, so when I first got it I planned to only eat half with the sizable side salad. However, this quickly became impossible when I bit into the soft, yielding layers of roti housing a belly of deliciously moist and seasoned mutton, with just enough potato to make a small but welcome presence.

Admittedly, I also tried the salmon wrap and it was less impressive (still not bad though!). The place is also a little dingy, but very laid back and Kensington-esque. But the curry goat roti has set a new standard for my rotis, and at $7.95 with fries/a salad, that is an impressive feat.

I will be back to fondly revisit my new favourite roti."}
{"text":"Spot idéal pour le brunch du week end après avoir fait la fête.
Situé au coeur du quartier hippie vous pourrez vous imprégner de l'atmosphère du quartier tout en dégustant une grande assiette d'oeufs brouillés, riz et saucisses ou tout simplement des pancakes au sirop d'érable. Le plus : le café est en free refill.

Nice place for the weekend brunch after the last night party.
Located in the heart of the hippie districit you will enjoy the district atmosphere while eating a huge plate of broiled eggs, rice and sausages or pancakes with maple syrup.
Bonus : coffee is in free refill."}
{"text":"We went for brunch on a Sunday, which was unlike most reviews I read where roti was the order of choice. And we had a pleasant surprise! There were 3 deluxe themed breakfast items along with the typical brunch orders. We had two of the three and they were absolutely delicious! Three small eggs over easy on top of savoury sautéed green pepper and onion with a fresh corn tortilla under it all. And the potatoes were what I was mostly looking forward to after seeing a picture of them on the front door. Move over KOS, Tasty is a worthy contender to the best home fries in these parts. Big chunky pieces of creamy, melt-in-your-mouth potatoes which only needed a light sprinkle of salt to complete. The other special came with home style baked black beans on the side and a chorizo sausage hash oozing with a nice depth of flavour. The orders were the perfect size, and the prices were very reasonable. It's great to see Tasty in this cool breezy summer spot rather than some generic coffee chain, yay for Tasty!"}
{"text":"I live in Kensington and eat here from time to time. I always kind of wonder why there aren't more people in this place. Maybe it's that they don't serve alcohol. Then I'm sure it would be full! I usually get the chicken roti, which is good... last time I got the hamburger and fries which was surprisingly cheap and actually good. If you're looking for a cheap meal, this is the place to go! There are a few other places in Kensington that serve some cheap meals which do serve alcohol as well, but I don't trust their food since I've heard some horror stories... however, Tasty Corner never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Ambiance was rustic but the food was \"tasty\". Definitely going back to try other items."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE OF MY LIFE! When I arrived at the restaurant, my partner and I had selected what we wanted and told our server we had a Living Social deal for $20 credit. Before saying more, we're 20% tippers on the original amounts, yelpers, foodies, and returners if we like a place. When I gave her the voucher I was informed by her that they didn't accept the voucher on weekends. I explained to her that stipulations can't be added to the voucher after purchase and I asked if I could speak to the manager. The manager never came after ten minutes and I saw our server pass us about ten times in that time (ignoring us). I got her attention again at the counter (when I got up to ask) and asked if we were going to get to speak to the manager. She said \"He's too busy and I don't think he's going to come over.\" I was appalled and knew who the manager was because she pointed him out before. He walked behind her and I got his attention for a second asking what was going on with the voucher. He repeated that he wouldn't honor it on the weekend and he said he put a sign on the door stating that. I explained that we came across town to eat at their restaurant and that the voucher didn't have \"weekdays only\" conditions when I bought it. He turned his back to me and proceeded to work without a response. I was then furious about not only the lack of service in honoring my voucher, but the blatant disrespect to first ignore me, and then to turn his back to me when I was being reasonable in my concerns and tone. I eat out 4-5 times per week and only use vouchers maybe once or twice a month. The food looked pretty solid for the price point. Treated better, I probably would've been a returner. I will never ever go back now!"}
{"text":"Food is remains great as usual. You get good value for your money (large portion sizes). But again I must caution you not to come if your in a hurry. The restaurant is rarely full yet it will take 30mins to get the food on average. Still, I enjoy their Western Omelette which is very large and tasty. All their omelettes come with toast and a helping of their delicious hashed potatoes w/ cooked onions."}
{"text":"Tasty Corner, though literally a minute from my house, has never intrigued me - until this past weekend. I stopped by there for lunch, and while it was pretty good, I wasn't blown away. 

From the outside, Tasty Corner looks a little sketchy - not sure what it is that turns me off, perhaps the green and purple color scheme - either way, it's just not the best looking restaurant I've ever seen. But in the spirit of not judging a book by it's cover, I went in for a bite. 

They have a pretty big menu, with breakfast and lunch dishes. While I originally went in for breakfast, I saw their vegetarian wraps and decided to try one! 

We split the \"Asparagus Wrap\" (asparagus, goat cheese, bell peppers) and the \"Avocado Wrap\" (avocado, pears, balsamic dressing) and both were pretty good. The asparagus however was prepared kind of poorly - I think it's common asparagus knowledge that you snap off the ends to avoid the stringy gross bottoms - instead I had to search through and remove those end bits. While the avocado wrap was delicious, there wasn't reallllyyy that much avocado in it, and both wraps were over stuffed with lettuce (the \"filler\" of the wrap world). Those complaints aside, they were still solid wraps.

The service here was kind of \"meh\" as well - it took way too long to get our wraps, and to have our order taken. As well I had to ask specifically if we got salad or fries with our wrap - she was already walking away - I kind of wonder if that means we would have just got fries (the standard assumption), or no sides at all! 

So, the biggest perk of this place is that two wraps with sides and drinks came to only $19, which is very reasonable! Since the food was decent as well, I could see myself going back."}
{"text":"Its name is modest and its exterior decor is cheesy -- covered in mediocre photos of breakfast food. I walked by this place so many times and never considered walking in.  But one lucky morning my boyfriend recommended we try it out. And Jesus Christ, this made it to my list of Top 5 Greatest Sunday Mornings Everrrrrrr.

I have never felt so happy in a restaurant. All the walls were pulled up and a cool breeze was sweeping through, shooing away my hangover. The sun was shining, the servers were smiling and people were chatting away. Everything was so colourful and bright -- just like a breakfast place should be. God, I love breakfast so much! 

It's usually very busy here on Sunday mornings so the service is slow. In fact, one of us always  walks to the cash register and orders through the person on cash, rather than waiting for a server to take our order. Sometimes it takes a while to get our coffees -- other times it's quick. There's one adorable server who always brings us our food. I wish I knew her name because she is literally the cutest person in the world and has this sincere smile that just makes you so happy and excited to eat breakfast!!!

My boyfriend and I always split an order of French Toast. The French Toast here is divine and they give you maple syrup on the side. If you're really hungry, then order the \"I Can't Talk/I'm Eating\" special. I'm not sure if that's what it's called, but it's something along those lines. It comes with eggs, meat, a salad and potatoes. I love ordering the Mix Grilled with over-easy eggs. It comes with toast, bacon, sausage, salad and potatoes. 

So far, this is the cheapest breakfast joint I've been to in Kensington Market."}
