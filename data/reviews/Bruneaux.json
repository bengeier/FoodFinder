{"text":"I have read countless reviews on Yelp and used it for restaurants in Pittsburgh, all over the country and overseas. This is the first review that I have ever written. I love a great steak and have had them in many famous steakhouses across the country and also in every steakhouse in Pittsburgh. We are spoiled in Pittsburgh to have many exceptional restaurants. However, none can match the steak I enjoyed at Bruneaux last night. I ordered the Tomahawk (32 oz.-bone-on) last night. It is, without question, one of the best steaks that I have ever had!  Certainly the best in Pittsburgh , and that's no knock on Pittsburgh's steakhouses. It was cooked to perfection. It was not charred on the outside but done to perfection (medium) all the way through. It was incredibly juicy and tender, but the flavor was just incredible. If you want a steak in the Pittsburgh area, I highly recommend Bruneaux. I assume the other cuts are equally delicious. P.S my wife's chicken was outstanding as well."}
{"text":"Food is very good but expensive. Over an hour wait to get our salad. Another hour to get the entree. This place food be great. Wait staff are ok but the long times between courses cause some awkward moments of \"any idea when our food might be out...\" Had the foie gras app. Tasty but would have wanted a bit more for the price. Wife had escargot and they were tasty. Filet au poivre for dinner was delicious. After spending 2.5+ hours the thought of dessert wasn't even considered. Too bad as they are made in house and sounded delicious"}
{"text":"I love it here. The food is excellent and the service is wonderful. A filet topped with lobster is incredible. Also, the place is beautiful!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service was slow. Took 45 minutes after ordering to get our meal.  The long upholstered bench seat along the wall is too high for the table and was uncomfortable, and if you are seated in the opposing chairs you have nothing but a wall for your view.  When the check came, oddly it was an unitemized bill, and though the amount was probably correct it made me feel suspicious.   As a local resident I was hoping Bruneaux could be a regular dinning destination but it's just another disappointment for Sewickley. Unfortunately, it's still Cranberry, Wexford, Robinson or downtown for the better restaurants. We are hopeful that it will evolve over time and we are considering giving it one more chance."}
{"text":"We had lunch there yesterday and sat out on the patio which was very nice. The service was very professional but definitely on the slow side. Not sure it should take 10 minutes to get a glass of wine when the restaurant was not busy.  Our luncheon salads were very disappointing. I ordered the Chopped salad that was missing the red onions and cucumbers and my friend ordered the Summer salad that was missing the pickled onions and red peppers. Definitely an oversight on their part. Maybe they do a better job for dinner?"}
{"text":"The ambiance on the patio is spectacular. However, the service is a bit slow and inconsistent. I ordered the foie gras and was surprised to see, not a velvety pâté, but a seared sliced of fatty duck. The server graciously apologized and took it back to the kitchen, explaining different chefs have \"their own interpretations of foie gras.\"  We asked for bread and were only given two slices of baguette. Our entrées were good and they have a decent wine list."}
{"text":"We had lunch there and waited almost an hour for our entree even though we were one of the first in the door. The decor and seating area is lovely but our food was late and extremely dry. The chicken roti main course was a dry airlines breast with some salad leaves, it was inedible. We complained about service and food and were told it was too bad. Where was a manager?"}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday, Feb 17, for the first time.  Food was great.  Had the chicken with the parmesan cream sauce.  It was delicious.  I had the mushrooms per the waitress suggestion and she was right.  Really adds to the dish.  I would have licked my plate if there had been no one to witness the action!  Sweetie had the lamb chops, also good (I think mine was better-his needed a little more chimichurri sauce in my opinion).  The service was superb, they space out the reservations, seemed like a lot of empty tables for a Saturday but there were no reservations available.  I suspect they believe in quality over quantity.  That is not a bad thing.  The chefs all were busy but not overwhelmed.  The head chef supervises well and checks with every diner to be sure they are satisfied.  I am sorry we waited so long to try this place.  We will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice restaurant and seems to be a favorite for locals looking for an upscale night out.  The manager seems to know almost everyone who comes in the door too.  We were seated promptly, though I thought it was odd we were told our table was ready, but if we would like to sit at the bar for a bit we could first.  The bar was literally a foot from our table, but I don't know maybe this is a routine thing.  We had the lobster bisque and foie gras as starters.  The bisque was very unique in both its presentation and taste, and delicious.  The foie gras fell short. The cooking method included the foie gras being charred a bit, and the flavor of the foie gras just didn't appeal to me.  For dinner I had the veal chop.  I appreciate that they cut the meat off the bone, that's the most difficult part of eating at a nice restaurant when you are trying to cut meat off a bone.  The chop was cooked very well and the morel cream sauce was delicious. If I had more bread I would have been cleaning my plate with it.  For dessert we had the cinnamon apple crepes.  They were a light ending to the meal.  The servers were very nice and attentive, but overall the pace of the meal and times between courses was very slow.  I enjoy my dinner companion but at a certain point we just ran out of stuff to talk about to fill the time.  We ended up being there for over 2 hours.  While the food is good I would just suggest planning for a long meal."}
{"text":"I've eaten here and it was delicious. It's hard to find a place away from downtown serving dishes like bone marrow. That was fantastic meal, but I want to talk about my experience using them for an event. I booked Bruneaux for my wedding dinner in March. I was having a non traditional wedding on a Thursday and looking for a cute place nearby to celebrate after. Dana at Bruneaux was wonderful. They work with you to create a buffet menu that fits your needs. Many people don't know you can rent their back patio (with lighted and heated tent) for events. It is as beautiful as the inside. I met with her, my then fiancé, and my parents and we set everything up to accommodate about 40 people. The tent had a problem the few days before the wedding date and she figured out a solution immediately. The night of the event was perfect. We had bruschetta, crab cakes, and meatballs as apps, 2 salads, apple cider braised pork, chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans, and lobster mac as the mains and brought our own dessert. The place was beautiful, the wait staff saved us a plate of apps, and the food was wonderful. My foodie brother-in-law who lives in CA was impressed-- he was worried that buffet food might not be that great and was pleasantly surprised. They even kept an eye on my bar tab to stay within the budget I had requested. Everything really was perfect. So while I'd definitely recommend for a night out, consider calling them for your next event as well!"}
{"text":"I've recently moved to Pittsburgh from New York and have a special place in my heart for French food given a very missed tradition of weekly dinners with my Dad at the local french bistro.  So naturally, I looked up reviews of all the best french restaurants in town and this place kept popping up.  Since I've moved, I've been here twice and loved both times.  I ordered the scallops with strawberries, a very delicious and unique combo (this was a seasonal dish), and the lamb.  Will definitely be coming back here, especially next time my Dad comes into town!"}
{"text":"My family enjoyed their meals so much they wouldn't stop talking about it! We all ordered the filet. My mom, who doesn't even like steak, raved about it. My dad said it was the best steak he'd ever had! They butcher the meat themselves, so it's high quality meat for an affordable price. There was a wait, so we ate at the bar. We had fantastic service and great drinks. Order a side of the Lobster Mac & Cheese; you'll thank me."}
{"text":"First of all, the only reason I'm only giving Bruneaux four stars is that I've only had lunch there.  I'll update this review once I go for dinner.   I know I previous reviewer had a bad service experience.  Not so with me.  I found the service to be excellent, perhaps erring on the side of overly-attentive, which isn't a problem for me.    I had the steak sandwich, \"Serenity Hills filet, caramelized onion and fennel, radicchio sauce, topped with fried jalapeño and pomegranate arils on a crusty baguette,\" and it was absolutely delightful.  The steak was well cooked and the sandwich well composed.  The root vegetable frites were likewise excellent.  The prices were very good for the quality of the food.    If I had to nitpick, it would be about the decor.  I prefer a more dim dining environment, and this place is white, white, white, and bright, bright, bright.  Again, I'll reassess after I've had a dinner service."}
{"text":"Not impressed the first time and gave it a second try last night and not changing my opinion. The red snapper was over cooked, Brussels sprouts under cooked, pork chops tasty but tough, beef roast had no taste, herb waffles had a weird flavor and the chicken was more like chicken fingers. The key lime pie was good but tiny. I expected more from a restaurant here in the Village with rather high prices. Decor was nice but food not worth the price."}
{"text":"Nice to find a very comfortable and delicious place for a Sunday brunch. From the BloodyMary to the coffee to the EggsBenedict, yummy.  Alex, our waiter was very nice and informative. We will definitely return"}
{"text":"Initially I wasn't going to write a review for Bruneaux. My husband and I walked in there at about 6 on a Thursday. I could see at least 4 empty tables, but we were turned away and told that they were completely full. Seems plausible, so I just let it go, until I saw a post on a friends facebook basically saying the exact same thing, they got there in the middle of lunch, tons of free tables, and they got turned away.   I don't really understand what is going on here, but it seems like the hostess or owners are not seating people for some reason..."}
{"text":"Though this is a beautiful restaurant, I have to say the the service left something to be desired. My friend and I had stopped by for their patio party on June 30th. We sit down and are then ignored for a solid 20 minutes by the waitstaff. Some of them were just standing around doing nothing. No one even asked to bring us water, let alone a drink menu. Finally a young waiter (around our age, 21) brought us a drink menu and we ordered. Over an hour later, and watching other tables waited on by the same young man receive not one but two rounds of drinks, we had had it. If it weren't for the wonderful couple that decided to sit down with us, as there was limited seating, we would have given the waiter an earful. I observed him tending to other tables wonderfully, and then standing under the canopy, completely disregarding us. Never once did he or any other of the waitstaff stop to ask us if we wanted water or apologize for the wait. We may have been a bit younger than the usual demographic at this restaurant, but our money was good, and we had it to spend that night.  Obviously we knew this was a nice restaurant, we dressed appropriately and were so excited to spend the evening here. Not once did we do anything to warrant such poor service and anywhere that you wait over an hour for two cocktails is a bust. I will not be returning here and I will discourage anyone else from going. Spend your money at an establishment that doesn't employ or tolerate this kind of service."}
{"text":"Our first time there & made a reservation thru Open Table for 5 pm to celebrate our anniversary.   The hostess was shocked as we walked in.  Apparently they open at 5 also and don't expect anyone to walk in that quickly.  The wait staff is dressed very nicely and appropriate for this higher end dining establishment.  But the hostess definitely needs to step it up quite a bit in her attire especially since she is who you see first.    For appetizers we had the beef carpaccio & butter poached lobster.  The carpaccio was a disappointment in that there just wasn't much of a taste; but the lobster was so tender and wonderful.  Dinner was scallops for me that had compressed strawberries & was absolutely delicious and my husband had the filet w/ a lobster tail added.  Filet was cooked to his liking but this lobster tail unfortunately was a bit rubbery.  Dessert was crepes with a fig filling and better than either one of us anticipated.    Great service.  Even with the slight disappointment with a few items, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing experience with great menu, will take quite a few trips to explore all the menu has to offer. Had the halibut, pretty safe choice, but amazingly impressed. Was there earlier this week, server Lily (sp?) could not have been more of a delight. Complex menu and she answered all my questions, no stumbling over her words. Will definitely be back to explore this creative menu and will ask for same server again. Must go"}
{"text":"Walking in I wanted to like it and it's rare I write a negative review, however with the cost and time of the experience (both being a lot) it should have been a much better one.    The experience was lacking.  Specifically the timing of the courses.  It took over an hour to get our salads.   The bread was a small piece of basic bread, mine seemed stale and when we asked for more because we had been waiting so long for our food; The wait staff told us there was a shortage and they were rationing it. It wasn't packed when we got there @ 7:00pm yet they had already run out of a few dishes. (On a Saturday night?). We finally got our entrees around 10:00.  Everybody liked their meal....although we joked that we were so hungry we would have liked almost anything."}
{"text":"Waiting for food for a while. Poor service, ok food. Nothing stellar. Cocktail was poorly made."}
{"text":"I treated myself to dinner here for my half-birthday, and was pretty well fawned over by the manager and my waiter from start to finish.  I got a 6pm reservation right when they opened for dinner, and by the time I left about 90 minutes later, the place was packed.  It being a Friday during Lent, I was sadly unable to indulge in some of the French classics that I'd normally go for (beef tartare, duck a l'orange, etc.), HOWEVER, their seafood selection was more than sufficient.  Ultimately I went with the winter salad, butter poached lobster appetizer, mushroom risotto, and fig jam and caramel crepes for dessert.  All of this was accompanied by a glass of wine.  Trust me, I wasn't deprived at all by lack of meat!  Now, I won't be making a regular evet of that kind of meal, but I will definitely be excited to patronize Bruneaux more often since my first visit went so well.  I'm hoping that over time, the inconsistencies that I see in some of these reviews work themselves out!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! The best fine dining in the area. Period. Never had a bad experience. Love the seasonal menu changes too. Great trendy atmosphere perfect for anyone in the family or from the office. A+"}
{"text":"Based on last night's dinner Bruneaux is getting an upgrade to 5 stars. Every aspect of the experience was excellent. The menu is diverse and creative, service professional, and the wine selections well conceived and fairly priced. Last night's Lenten sacrifice was the Dover sole, which was extraordinarily good. We didn't want or need anything else, except, of course, a bottle of California Chardonnay. If you are looking for something to criticize, the dining room is a little crowded and parking on busy Friday and Saturday nights can be somewhat of a challenge, but overall Bruneaux is an excellent special occasion restaurant."}
{"text":"Been here three times.  New is Sewickley so wanted to give it a chance.  Very small portions and just OK food.  Not hot when served despite. Ot being busy.  The kitchen is open to the dining room and twice the entire restaurant smelled like fuel (butane or something) during our entire dinner.  Needs some improvement if they are going to make it.  Don't expect the, to be around in a year."}
{"text":"Bruneaux is the best option for fine dining in Sewickley Village. Upscale and elegant atmosphere without feeling too stuffy. Bruneaux also has the best patio for outdoor dining. The food is exceptional. I highly recommend the dover sole, filet, butter poached lobster, lamb chops...basically everything on the menu is excellent! The service is impeccable and the entire staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I was highly impressed with Bruneaux. It's located on the main street where The Sewickley Cafe used to be. The decor is modern and beautiful. We went on a Friday night and I made reservations on Open Table. You can also sit at the bar and eat if there are not available tables. I was worried that the service would be slow based on reviews but we didn't experience any issues.   We started with bread and butter, mussels and maple pork belly. The mussels had chorizo in them which gave the dish a nice Smokey flavor. The pork belly was absolutely delicious. For the main entree we ordered the duck and the scallops. The duck was delicious and based on the picture you will see that when ordered rare, it came out rare! The scallops were seared slightly more than I would have liked but they were wonderful and the wasabi risotto that it came with was not overpowering at all. For dessert we ordered the homemade crepes with apples. This was simple and the great way to end the meal.   I found the staff to be extremely attentive. The chef delivered our appetizers to the table and then came around during our main course to see how we were enjoying the food. He wasn't pushy and it seemed like he was asking because he really cared. Please go try this place!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic and would be a welcomed addition to any major city food scene. The butter poached lobster was rich and delicious but the real star for me was the duck a l'orange. I've never had a duck breast so tender, moist, and flavorful. The table ordered the Branzino as an app to share and it was perfect!  The service was excellent; warm, courteous, and accommodating. I cannot say enough good things about Bruneaux and am excited to return on our next trip through Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"We had a delicious and relaxing lunch at Bruneaux. Since it was St Patrick's day there were a lot of areas we wanted to avoid. So we decided to try somewhere new and thought the Sewickley area would be a good place to look. We read online reviews for a number of different restaurants in the area and decided to give Bruneaux a try and we are certainly glad we did. Since it was a cold day we ate inside. The decor is very lovely and has a relaxed but French feeling. The outdoor dinning looks beautiful and we plan to come back once it gets warmer. I went with my husband and adult daughter. I had the croque madame which was very tasty. The last time I had it was a few years ago in Montmartre and have wanted to have it ever since. It did not disappoint, the mornay sauce with a hint of dijon was delicious. I had it with the pomme frites which were the best fries ever. I don't even know why but there was something so good and fresh about them. My husband had the Bruneaux Burger and he said it was truly one of the best burgers he had ever had. My daughter had the salmon entree which she truly enjoyed. We will definitely be back and I highly recommend giving it a try. Sewickley is such a cute little town it's a fun place to walk around and check out a few shops after you finish your lunch."}
{"text":"Was looking for a \"nice\" place to have lunch with my hubby before starting a new job. Pasted this place and said \"why not!\". Glad we did. The place was quiet, only a few tables since it was the end of their lunch and the close between lunch and dinner. I had soup and salad. The soup was hot and had plenty of flavor. The salad was fresh, so fresh it included some plastic from the bag it came in! Told the waitress who told the chef and said sorry about that. Didn't take anything off the bill which I was surprised. My husband had a chicken sandwich which he said was well cooked and tasty."}
{"text":"I read a bunch of mixed reviews about Bruneaux so I was unsure of whether or not I wanted to try it out.  A lot of the more unfavorable reviews were from shortly after their opening and since they have now been open for 4 months I decided to take a chance.  We were pleasantly surprised. There were some annoyances which is why I gave it 4 stars, but overall my wife and I were pleased with our experience.    We started out with steak tartar.  It was tasty and a good portion size though it could have used at least one more piece of toasted bread. The dish didn't wow us but there was also nothing bad about it.  For entrees, I got the filet au poivre and my wife got the scallops.  We were both very pleased with our choices. My filet was one of, if not the best pieces of meat I have ever had in a restaurant.  It was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. The mashed potatoes with cheese and the grilled zucchini were excellent sides. My wife enjoyed her scallops on a bed of butternut squash risotto topped with apple relish.  She even had a hard time finishing them because there were 5 very large scallops.  For dessert we tried their Valentine's special which were 2 chocolate cookie shot glasses filled with mousse and topped with a whipped cream. It was ok.  If this is an example of their specialty dessert, it's safe to say that dessert is not their strong point.  I wouldn't get it again.   Overall the service was good but the restaurant was barely half full and it still took longer than we expected to get our meals.  The music was also lacking. It was at times too loud and too annoying.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others if for no other reason than the steak. On food, they did a great job. Dessert not so much and service was just acceptable."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant.   It was a cool summer evening and we were seated in the open courtyard which was lovely.   There was a DJ which was fine, although sometimes the sound was a bit loud for carrying on conversations with my fellow diners.  It was also \"ladies drink for $5.00\" night which was a little tacky considering the price point at which we were dining.  To me, it didn't seem to be utilized by the female patrons anyway.   My advice is to move on from gender specific gimmicks.    Pre dinner drinks at the bar were done well.  I must, however, stop to mention the use of awkward and unsanitary flat screens used to peruse the menu.   I was told that a local entrepreneur has developed this software; I appreciate their interest in community support, however this impersonal bobble is just as unpleasant here as it is at Eat N' Park.   Where was I?  Ah yes the food.    The menu was all over the place.  It seemed clear they are still deciding what type of restaurant they'd like to become.   Believe the server when they mention that the small plates are small; In fact, they are microscopic to be precise.   Some things were good, such as the Mussels.   Other small plates only moderately resembled their descriptions from the menu.    There was no benefit to ordering wine by the bottle so we all chose individual glasses.   The wine list was fine though Im not accustomed to red wine being served in a chilled glass.    As for entrees, the fish plate was delicious.  However my red meat course was served at a cool medium rather than the hot medium rare as requested.    For dessert, we passed.   Only one option was made in house.  The rest were brought in from a bakery in Squirrel Hill.   I'm sure this is fine for patrons who enjoy this particular bakery in Squirrel Hill.   We all passed.     Bottom line. I expect more from a bottom line of that size.   To end on a positive note: The staff was all very friendly and attentive and both the interior space and exterior spaces were lovely."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this restaurant and left underwhelmed. The decor was very inviting and classy. We were seated promptly but we're not greeted by a server for 10 minutes. After watching the other staff walk past us with no acknowledgement I finally said something. We were then greeted by our server. We ordered a glass of wine and a cocktail. The cocktail was very watered down and we requested another shot. After another long wait we finally ordered our meals to find out our choices were not available that night. Since we had already been waiting 30 minutes to order food it would have been nice to know the 89 items. After another long wait our small plate came out with our entrees. My scallops and steak tartar were AMAZING. My husbands duck was overlooked but they never requested a temperature so it may have been unavoidable. This restaurant has a lot of potential and the chefs are clearly skilled and care about presentation. I hope if we come back we have a better all around experience."}
{"text":"Very accommodating for a group of 7 at Sunday brunch! Great waiter, and the menu so creative and freshly prepared, and for roughly the same price as a boring omelette at most diners. Can't wait to go back when the weather improves to enjoy the beautiful outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Hands down the best meal of 2018. Fantastic service and atmosphere. Started with escargot and foie gras which both were fantastic. We then had the scallops and red snapper. The scallops were absolutely incredible. Got 5 huge portions which I was surprised. The red snapper was so delicious and great portion.  The service was on point and even the chef came out to ask us about the meal which was rare and nice  Highly recommend and will be back"}
{"text":"This place bit off more than can chew.  They are generally going for a vibe they can't backup with the food. The foie was tough, having been sliced thin and burned. The mussels were served in kielbasa water, and the duck was all fat.   The atmosphere is pretty cool, but I wouldn't go back for dinner."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  My wife had the Duck a L'Orange and I had the Poulet a le Creme.  Both dishes were outstanding.  The wait staff was very attentive but not overly bothersome.  It was noisy due to a large group at the bar.  The manager comp us our desserts due to the noise level.  My one complaint, and its not much, is I didn't like the Ipad wine list.  Just give a simple printed list.  It is so much easier to handle.  We will be back soon"}
{"text":"My friend and I went for brunch today and it was delicious! We were expecting service to be pretty slow from reviews we had heard in the past, but it really wasn't! It was so nice to not feel rushed out the door so they could turn tables over.   My friend had an orange juice and I had an Aperol Spritz (my favorite brunch drink!) We shared the biscuit basket (4 very small biscuits plus three teaspoon sized portions of amazing delish butter). She had the French toast with cooked apples (she shared- it was so good!) I had the Guyere Omlette on a bed of dressed arugula and it was also very good. I was surprised at how little cheese there was and how small the portion was over all compared to the French toast which cost the same. But I really wasn't starving so it was a good amount for me this morning.   A few other things to note: literally nothing else in Sewickley is open on Sunday except for the Starbucks down the road. So if you're looking for a casual stroll like we had anticipated, you will be out of luck. But the streets are so beautiful that it is still just as lovely a walk as it would be if the stores were open. There also were very few other people in the restaurant. One small family and a couple which left shortly after we arrived. The servers were very nice, though there were many of them for such a slow Sunday (we arrived around 11 and their brunch is 10-2) there were no complaints on our end though because our service was quick.   I liked this brunch vibe a lot more than many spots in downtown Pittsburgh because it was so nice and not very crowded. Price wise Bruneaux is very comparable to downtown, just easier parking and a bit more upscale."}
{"text":"Robin F and Nathan G did an outstanding job remodeling what was once known as the Sewickley Cafe into this current restaurant. The front has a garage door opening and as well as elegant seating and an inviting patio with a brick fireplace in the back for outdoor dining. It has decorative lighting and even the bar area has seats instead of stools to sit in. Thumbs up for the workmanship in making this place very attractive!  I had a reservation so I was seated promptly. I learned from my waitress that the owner also operates Mambo Italiano  restaurant, also in Sewickley and this place is a now a New American restaurant with French influences.  Service was friendly and as I was debating the menu options I finally decided to go with the salmon filet chutney, rice, lentils, and mushrooms. Although the menu says \"bread available upon request\", I learned they discontinued that service.  I did have to wait a bit for my food but not overly long. The presentation was spot on but needless to say that's where it ended. I found the two end sides of my salmon to be a little tough and the rice towards the center didn't seem to be thoroughly cooked. Other than that it was a decent meal but I would have liked the bread to \"catch\" all the loose rice.  Dress is very casual at least for lunch. Prices are on par with what you would expect for this type of restaurant. Located right in the heart of the shopping district on Beaver Ave in Sewickley, metered street parking is available."}
{"text":"We had a great time here.  Service was good and the steaks were great.  I believe this to be better than my previous favorite steakhouse  downtown (capital grille). I loved the Caesar salad and the Lobster soup was fantastic.  The 10 oz Filet was exceptional and cooked to medium perfection.  We wanted to try dessert but were too full.  We will be back in the summer to try the awesome patio......although the inside was very elegant."}
{"text":"My Hometown. We visited this restaurant at or around 5:00PM. No one was in the Restaurant so the person sat us against the wall. While we were having dinner people started coming in and they were being seated outside on the patio. I am very familiar with the patio since this was the old Sewickley Café location. We were very disappointed we were not given that option because it was a very nice evening. Had the Pork Chop and it was alright.  The Peach Pie was fantastic. Service was great but very disappointed that we couldn't sit outside. There was no one in the restaurant until at or around 5:45PM. Overall, food was alright, service was great but treated like we were just stopping in for a quick lunch."}
