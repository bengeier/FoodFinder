{"text":"Definitely pricey for ramen, especially with add-ons, but the broth was good and the noodles tasted freshly made. I can't quite remember what my husband ordered but I had the Shio ramen. The star for me was the meat bao - more memorable than my ramen dish but to be fair, I'm not exactly a huge fan of ramen. In other words, I never crave it. But I could easily eat 12 of those meat baos :)"}
{"text":"I love ramen. This place doesn't even make you want to order their ramen. I was reading the descriptions of their different ramen bowls and I was just turned off. Nothing sounded appetizing. So I decided to just have drinks and some appetizers. I honestly should have just left after reading their menu. The only thing I could imagine being tasty from their menu was the fried cauliflower and the fried pig ears... BIG mistake. Both appetizers were bland and very awkward tasting. I never have written a review on yelp but I felt compelled to warn others about this place. Service was ok but food leaves A LOT to be desired. ***OWNER AND CHEF, YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD ABOUT SERVING OVERPRICED TASTELESS FOOD TO THESE FINE PEOPLE OF PITTSBURG***"}
{"text":"Still in its soft opening so I'm sure it will find its footing. Server forgot a few things but was great about fixing quickly. Sparse menu, the food was tasty but not remarkable. The best part was the crispy pig ear app."}
{"text":"This place was pretty nice. They have a great bar and the bartender made me a nice Japanese highball. I would have given it 4 starts, but I didn't love my entree (miso ramen) but honestly, that's on my for not ordering something else--I kind of knew that I would have dinner envy. It's not like the miso ramen was bad, it just was clearly not as good as what everyone else got.

Anyway, the place has more hipsters than Brooklyn, so if that's not your thing I would watch out. But, that being said--it's a good spot for ramen and overall has a really cool vibe.--3/5 stars because I'm a jag."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for fresh Ramen in the Burg! I had the inferno ramen bowl  it did not disappoint. The noodles were cooked perfectly the fried chicken skin had so much flavor and the soft boiled egg was an added bonus. Also had the pork belly Bao...Such a treat! The bun was soft and fluffy the pork belly was perfectly cooked. A full bar compliments this restaurant... Prices are right. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Ehhhhh I expected a lot more from Ki Ramen and I guess would give 3.5 stars if yelp allowed but everything was so average and the service was below average. I can't quite fathom why they have MSG on the table but, makes me wonder how much is in their soup... I had the veggie curry ramen it was decent. The Bao bun was the best part of my meal, I don't feel like I'll need to return."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere, and in a hip portion right on Butler, interior seating in three sections of different elevation.

But everything about the food was lackluster. Cauliflower appetizer had a slight peanut flavor but was mostly bland, and our two ramen bowls were not up to par. Dragon ramen had an undercooked egg compared to what is expected in Ramen, and mine was far too salty.  

We will be back to try more of the options and give Ki Ramen another chance, but the first time through was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Cool little ramen place in Lawrenceville. We went here for a late lunch and were very happy with the experience. We  sat in the main dining area which was nicely decorated with Asian-style wood paneling. The menu has approximately six different ramen options along with add-ons for the ramen, snacks and side dishes. We started with the fried cauliflower which was crispy and well flavored. I had the Dan Dan ramen for my main course which was also amazing. I decided to add some chili paste to increase the spice and didn't find it overpowering. The dish itself had kimchi and bits of tofu in it as well as a soft boiled egg. The noodles were fresh and the broth was very savory. Service was attentive and prompt throughout our meal. Overall, very happy with the experience and would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Ki Ramen is a great addition to Pittsburgh. We got the Shoyu Ramen and Dan Dan Ramen and the flavors were great. Service was fast and the staff were friendly."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but it was actually comical how rude our waitress was. Like I'm laughing writing this because I felt like we were being pranked. She ignored questions, explained nothing, and mumbled rudely while rolling her eyes at us"}
{"text":"Best Ramen I have had in Pittsburgh! I went with the Shoyu; and my date had the Curry Ramen. I need to go back and try them all! Only complaint is it was very loud in the restaurant. Some sound reducing wall panels could easily solve that problem."}
{"text":"The ramen was just okay but what overshadowed our experience was the long wait time and extremely rude service. The waitress spilled water all over our table and didn't even blink. She acted like it was completely normal to just spill water all over our table and not even apologize or give us new napkins. The people working there seemed genuinely miserable. No one smiled  and everyone acted like they did not want to be there and were waiting for their shift to be over. I go out for ramen probably once every week or 2 but will never return to this place because of the extremely rude wait staff. Never again. Go to Tan Izakaya in Shadyside ... the ramen is better - but more importantly- the wait servers are actually nice people and won't treat you like crap."}
{"text":"PROS: Nice decor, I like how they have three different areas of the restaurant. Clean. The noodles were bouncy and acceptable. Service was fast and what you would expect from a fast turnover restaurant.

CONS: The ramen is not authentic. The broth was salty and lacked the depth and umami you expect from tasty ramen. The pig ear appetizer was too salty. 

They had some generic ramen bowls and some more Americanized ramen bowls. Overall, probably the best ramen in Pittsburgh but that's not saying much.

One suggestion would be to get disposable bibs like they have in Japan! :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant definitely looks nice but the food is lacking in quality.  The ramen bowls are slightly overpriced and the portions are rather small.  Go elsewhere for your cold weather hot soup fix"}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch/early dinner on Saturday. Ramen bowls were tasty and the waiter was super helpful. He inquired about any food allergies and told us what to avoid based on that info. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to Ki Ramen for my fiancé's birthday dinner. No reservations but not a problem on a Wednesday night. We sat on the top level by the kitchen which provided a really cool environment. 

We started with the cucumber snack and the fried cauliflower. Bother were outstanding and I'm going to try my best to copy the peanut sauce on the cauliflower on my own. I had the vegetarian curry ramen and added a 6 minute egg and chili paste, which provided the perfect amount of spice. He got the Shio Ramen, which he raved about and loved the crispy pig ears in the dish. 

Only complaint was service was lacking in some areas such as not getting water refills, utensils, etc. Food made up for it though so still gets 5 stars in my book. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but was treated so egregiously the second time I came here, I wanted to write one. Rest assured, the low rating is not for the food. The food was excellent. We had the fried cauliflower, which was not one bit greasy, perfectly crispy, and came with a delightful peanut sauce. My partner and I both had ramen - I forget what mine was called, but it had pigs ears and I added a soft boiled egg. 

The one star is for the service. Our waitress was dreadful. When my partner tried to order wine, she made a high-pitched sound as if he had murdered a puppy in front of her, before aggressively recommending a different wine. A simple \"I think this wine would pair better,\" would have sufficed. I ordered the cider on tap as per her recommendation, and when I declined to have a second drink, she asked me \"What's the point of having only one beer?\" Well, for starters, I'm drinking cider, not beer. Second, what is the point of that comment? There are a thousand reasons one might only want to have one drink! Perhaps one is on medication and has to watch how much they drink, perhaps one has plans later and wants to pace themselves, etc. The rudest thing she said, though, was that I should not finish my appetizer as it will fill me up too much and I won't have room for ramen. Girl, you don't know me; you don't know what I've eaten today, you don't know what my relationship to food is like, and who gets full off of a little cauliflower? She did not say anything like that to my male partner. 

She also brought over someone else's food to show another table as she felt she was having trouble describing that night's special and wanted them to see it. For what it's worth, I used to work in food service, and that is a massive mistake and also probably/definitely a health code violation.

I had been here once before for lunch and had a great time. I will likely not be back again, lest someone literally tell me not to eat my food at a restaurant."}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite new restaurant to open on Butler St within the last five years! My first ramen restaurant ever and both my 12-year-old daughter and I loved it! Delicious flavorful broth and interesting add-ons! I'll go back again and again. I want to try every saké on the menu!"}
{"text":"The best ramen in the burgh! I don't know how others are disagreeing with that. I love this place so much that I walked all the way there last Sunday just to find out it was closed. (So keep that in mind) But I was able to go back a few days later and it was just as delicious as I remembered!! I recommend the rayu cucumber appetizer and all of the bao buns I've had were great!"}
{"text":"My husband is a huge ramen fan so when we moved here this is one of the first places we checked out. We both kept it simple when ordering- I got the curry and he got the shio. I added the onsen egg but next time I would chose the nitamago egg instead. Both broths were delicious and did not need the butter ball add in but I would probably try it next time. We ended up with the server who was awful but the rest of the staff seemed to have the specials easily memorized and were speedy with getting plates and giving the check. We will definitely be back to try more (and will be keeping our fingers crossed for a different server)."}
{"text":"A solid place to get Ramen in pittsburgh but I wouldn't call it a landmark restaurant yet. I went during its soft opening so I hope they keep on improving their Ramen. The space is awesome. There are three levels with plenty of seating. I ordered the inferno beef Ramen which had a good beefy broth with a moderate amount of heat. It's not as spicy as the name implies. I would have liked a little larger portion size. It leaves plenty of room in the stomach for an appetizer or two which I did not try. I'll definitely give Ki Ramen another visit when the restaurant officially opens."}
{"text":"No doubt the most serious diligent ramen place in Burgh FINALLY. A five in Pittsburgh area(4 or less compared to NY's ramen bars) Plus the so-called \"undercooked noodle\" by some reviewers is an intensional touch. Just like al dente when you cook pastas."}
{"text":"Very friendly service (*Lindsey was our server)from the moment in the door. VERY clean, even saw an employee cleaning a random wall, often overlooked area in most restaurants. 
Great music. Decent beer selection. 
Drank warm sake, creamy and smooth. 
Favorite dish: eggplant appetizer and meat bao bun. They even have lovely veggie options. Everything was awesome! 
I'm quite picky, and I say don't hesitate to go here!"}
{"text":"We went here on a whim Saturday night. 
We had been leaving a party and decided we needed a little warm up. 

I went with my 2 vegan friends, my fish eating fiance, and non picky eater other friends. 
My SO ordered the fish ramen special and LOVED it. I did not try it as I am not a huge fish lover.
I got the inferno. No extras added to it, I let it come the way the menu described he.

My opinion:
Well the soup broth was pretty solid, spicy but not overly so. 
The beef was tender and perfect, completely melt in your mouth good.
The noodles were house man, but honestly I couldn't tell them from any other noodle I've ever had and seemed just okay. 
The vegan/vegetarian soup my friend got tasted okay but I would definitely say it would benefit for a bunch of add ons. He added pepper and msg and chili paste but it didn't really make it much better.

I think they basis is they WANT you to order all the add ons, to increase the cost, and up the flavours. I think the soups would definitely be way better with the add-ons and next time I go there I was test those out. 

When in doubt, order the butter bomb with your ramen!!!"}
{"text":"First thing I noticed about this place is their decor. Very hip and modern. 
We ordered fried cauliflower, shio and shoyu ramen. Pretty standard. 
The cauliflower came with a peanut sauce that made it pretty unique. I'm not a big fan of it but my husband seemed to like it a lot. To me it feels like they just cook the cauliflower and sprinkled some spices on it and drizzled the peanut sauce...I can probably make a similar version at home. 
The broth was not too bad. Pig ears is definitely some interesting add-on for ramen noodles. 
We went on a Friday night, the place was mostly full. 
Tbh, I wouldn't say this is a traditional ramen place since a lot of the dishes came with their own twist, which is cool but not what I'm looking for. 
I'm giving it a 4 since the service was pretty good. 
If you are tired of traditional style of ramen and want to try something unique, this place would be perfect for you."}
{"text":"I've been here three times, once when it was busy, once when it was moderately busy, and once when it was nearly empty.

Every time I've been to Ki Ramen I've had excellent service.  The staff is eclectic, attentive but not overbearing, and informed about the menu and ingredients.

I love that the Ramen here is MSG free (I have a sensitivity to it).  They also give an option to add MSG at the table, so it's nice if you like it.

There's a nice selection on tap and in bottle.

The ramen itself is authentic and delicious.  Delicate flavours have obviously been carefully cultivated with plenty of options to make your ramen just how you like it.

The fried cauliflower is a must try.

The prices are reasonable, though the numbers can add up quickly once you add drinks and appetizers to the bill.

As for atmosphere, the music is good.  The dining room is spare but open with a nice, high ceiling.  It can get crowded when it's busy, nearly shoulder to shoulder in a way that might not work if you're a bigger person, so heads up on that.

I'll definitely be back.  It's my anniversary go to."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to relax and get some food. I really enjoyed the ambiance. I was here on a Friday night, around 8:30 - just a party of two - and we were seated right away. I got the dan dan ramen - which includes cured tofu. It was decent but overly salted. The server was attentive and this was an overall pleasant visit. I'll definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"Ramen isn't normally my first choice but I came to this spot on a Thursday around 6 with a couple of girl friends . I came in the side door which had a little mini bar to like eat at.

I really enjoyed my meal. I had the inferno and it was super spicy but had a lasting spiciness. It settled on my tongue and it just kinda simmered there. It was a different type of spiciness that I really liked. It has beef, noodles, egg, and I think chicken skin. 

I also had the arsenal cider which I really loved. I really enjoyed this restaurant and I would come back here . The atmosphere is pretty great and it was not busy at the time we were there."}
{"text":"First off let me say when I lived in Charlotte,NC there was a Ramen spot that is beyond words it's sooo good . And it was my favorite restaurant in the city. So my review may be biased because of that restaurant. 

This place is interesting. It's got a party vibe going with music playing and loud talking. 

All cocktails are 10$ each. which feels like a lot.  I tried the tiki punch it was just ok not much flavor honestly. I resorted to a Stella after. 

I tried the bao buns. They rotate the meat and the vegetarian options. They offered fried cod as the meat and roasted eggplant as the veggie. I got one of each and the veggie one was amazing! I'd go back for that!

The ramen though is pretty basic. You pick your base and then do add ins to customize...and by customize I mean make it delicious.  I got the shoyun ramen added more mushrooms, Brussels and the butter bomb. It was good but it really adds up doing add ins and I'm not sure the bowl without the add ins would be very satisfying. 

I'd say give it a shot if you're open to a new age interpretation of ramen where you really customize your dish but don't expect traditional ramen or bao buns by any means."}
{"text":"We went here last night and had a wonderful experience! Everyone was very friendly and patient with us (we got there with 45 minutes to close so we were very appreciative of the warm welcome). The drink selection isn't huge but its a great variety with something something to satisfy everyone's taste (beer selection, wines, and cocktails). I had the curry ramen which was very flavorful and had the perfect spice to it. The music they play is very eclectic and was actually a conversation piece for the two of us as we heard songs we hadn't heard in years so it definitely added to the fun experience. Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu and was also very sweet about explaining everything on it (I had no clue). Made for a great weekday date night! We will be back soon! :)"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: this was my first time visiting a ramen restaurant, so I have nothing to compare it to and I probably should've researched beforehand. We started out with veggie and crab bao buns, and they were absolutely worth it - I'd come back again exclusive to eat those!  I ordered the ramen with chicken in it and was a little less impressed with that. The portion was pretty large, but it was incredibly difficult to eat. I'm not very skilled with chopsticks and the noodles don't really cooperate with a spoon... but I suspect that's more my issue than Ki Ramen's! The fried chicken pieces were also really large, making them tough to eat but tasted fine once I could cut them up a little. Zack, our waiter, was incredibly friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. He gave us numerous suggestions and I felt like he helped us make some good choices."}
{"text":"Soo flavorless and wrong that it's disrespectful. I have eaten ramen all around the United States and the world. I felt insulted after eating this \"ramen\". The broth is flavorless- possibly just store bought chicken broth in a bowl. The egg was awful and I had a HUGE eggshell in my food. The \"inferno\" \"ramen\" has the spice level of a cup of flour- I still can't figure out why it's called inferno.

And the noodles are hard and have an odd flavor to them.

There are No souls in these bowls. 

Honestly I rather have a 'cup of noodles' which they hilariously use as a cup for chopsticks (so embarrassing). 

I won't be coming back and will definitely point out to people that this place was the worst ramen I've ever had."}
{"text":"When I heard that a chef from Piccolo Forno was collaborating with a chef from Umami for a ramen restaurant, I was beyond excited!!! I love both of those places and am obsessed with ramen!

...I think I might have overhyped it in my mind. The ramen noodles were a great texture (not too chewy but not too soggy), and the broth was flavorful, but it didn't blow my mind. Still one of the better options for ramen in Pittsburgh, and definitely worth the try!"}
{"text":"Meh. I've had much better ramen elsewhere. Atmosphere is nice  and the service is good. Might be back because it is close to my house but not worth the effort if you aren't close by"}
{"text":"We rolled through at around 10 pm on August 12th to check out the soft opening, and were very pleased. We didn't try any of the appetizers, though we would have liked to try the kim chi (they were out). We sat upstairs at the bar facing the kitchen and saw several plates of the fried cauliflower go out, and it looked quite tasty.

The limited menu ended up being just fine, as we thought both the Shoyu Ramen and Shio Ramen sounded great. We both added chili paste for $1, as lovers of all things spicy. Both were fantastic, and the homemade noodles really stood out. They have a bit more of a bite to them than your usual ramen noodle, which I enjoyed, though they didn't soak up the broth as much. Nicely sized portions with plenty of ingredients mingling in the bowls. I've already seen even more appetizing items have been added to the full menu, so it will be nice to check the place out again once the usual Pittsburgh wintry winds come through.

Service left a little to be desired that night, and the noodles took longer than we were expecting. The waitress seemed eager to leave for the night and we felt rushed to order and finish eating. It wasn't quite the end of the night yet, with a couple hours left, but hopefully some of these issues will be resolved as the restaurant matures."}
{"text":"I went to Ki Ramen on a Saturday with a group of 4 and we were seated immediately.  The menu is small but the food was delicious! They have chopsticks on the table but if you are less confident in your skills, you can ask for a fork which two of us did. I got the Shoyu Ramen with edamame and if you are a newbie to Ramen, it's a good place to start.

This is on Butler Street so we did struggle to find parking but it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"Cheap beer and great ramen, what a combination. One of the beers they had was a cream ale that was $2, and I asked the waitress if it was actually alcoholic cause I couldn't believe that they would sell real beer for so cheap. (It was, and it was delicious.) The ramen can come with different add-ons. The butter bomb didn't really add much to it unfortunately, it seemed like just a gimmick, but I do like to get the chili paste on the side. I definitely recommend adding an egg!"}
{"text":"The space itself is beautiful, but that doesn't mean much if the food is lackluster. And, oh boy, is it ever lackluster! The star of the show--the ramen--is tasteless and bland, served lukewarm by an Eeyore of a waiter who seems deflated by the mere presence of customers. The broth lacks richness, the noodles lack bite, the meat is flavorless. . .it's like they took everything that's supposed to be good about a piping hot bowl of well-made ramen and threw it out the window. 

I was never a fan of Umami's ramen, but I thought that maybe with the spotlight on one dish, things might improve. That hasn't happened. I just don't get it. It doesn't help to try and gussy something up with fancy add-ins if the fundamental building blocks are terrible.

It's my sincere hope that someday Pittsburgh will get an authentic ramen place without a lot of bells and whistles, because guess what? If done properly, ramen doesn't need much window dressing. If an actual ramen restaurant ever opens here, god help these places popping up that are all swagger and no substance."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and excellent food. In Pittsburgh for a job and had to stop in the place that makes their ramen in house! I had the spicy ramen bowl which the waitress warned me was pretty hot and I still went for it, she was not wrong. My girlfriend had the tofu bowl which was delicious and very flavorful. Also do not skip the Bar buns, they are a must try."}
{"text":"Very excited to see a new ramen spot open in Pittsburgh! I had very high expectations for this place and was not disappointed!!

Currently the restaurant is still in their soft opening. They are open 5p-12a Monday through Saturday, have a full bar, and a \"limited menu\". To be honest the menu a it stands now was sufficient choice and variety for me and I was happy with all the options. They have a variety of ramen bowls you can customize with add ons to elevate the bowl to an even higher level of flavor. One of which is the butter bomb which I did not get to try but definitely have my eye on for my next visit. 

This was my first time here and I got the Shio ramen. It came with crispy pig ears, pork belly, scallions, sesame seeds, and a soft boiled egg. The noodles were a little under cooked for my liking in a ramen bowl but the flavor was amazing. I appreciate that they make their own hand pulled noodles and you can tell by the freshness and flavor. I also tried the Inferno ramen. I was a little less impressed with the flavor but a beef bowl isn't usually my go to anyways so I expected this. I also tried the Ti-Ki punch that had vodka, hibiscus, and elderflower and am still drooling over this refreshing and light drink. The size of the draft beer was a little smaller than what I was expecting but also very delicious. 

Overall I think it's a great addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene. I'll be recommending this place to all my friends who still live here and definitely be back to try the shoyu ramen as soon as I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"I think this place deserves the 3.5 star rating.  
It's still fairly new so it was hard to get a table on a Friday/sat night when we originally tried to go.   We made it to lunch, and it was more accessible.  We actually first tried this place when it was a pop- up and DH loved the soup whereas I found my miso bland.  Anyway we gave it another shot.   
Ambience -5 neat, clean, although some tables are really smushed together.   
Food - the bun was actually really tasty!  We got the veggie bun and had a great texture and flavor.   The ramen was 3-4 stars.  I got the vegetarian one with kimchi and tofu but subbed the tofu for chicken (incidentally not sure the substitution was worthy the extra 4 as the chicken didn't absorb the flavor well and seemed more like an afterthought).   
Service - 5.  Our waitress was quite good, friendly, and popped up without being overbearing
Price-1.   The food was filling, but not sure it was worth the price.  After adding in all the extras/subs, it was ok.   The base ones should have already had some of the 'extras.'
Anyway -my 2c!"}
{"text":"Full disclaimer, this is the first time I ever had authentic ramen so I have nothing to judge it against. All I can say is that my ramen was delicious, the wait staff was excellent and the atmosphere is very good. I need to go back soon to try their other options. 

Had the pork bun appetizers... worth a trip just for them."}
{"text":"The ramen was very good, but the service and cocktails were not impressing. With Pittsburgh's great restaurant scene, I expected more experienced bartenders, better drinks and better service from wait staff."}
{"text":"I'm really into Ki Ramen! The atmosphere is spot on - we sat at the upstairs bar looking into the open kitchen and it was really cool to see the dishes being put together. They had a good selection of drinks, including several types of sake, and I believe they have a rotating IPA draft as well. We ordered the meat bao bun to share - that day it was fried chicken. We loved it!

For our main dishes we ordered dan dan (me) and inferno (fiance). I subbed the onsen egg (sous vide - soft boiled) for the nitamago and added mushrooms. I'm so glad that I swapped the eggs - the soft boiled egg broke down and added so much extra flavor to my noodles! Probably didn't need the mushrooms, but they were a good add on. Next time I want to try a butter bomb! The noodles were perfectly cooked, although I wish there were more of them. My fiance loved the inferno ramen, especially the chicken skin. I love that you're able to customize your flavor with the seasonings at the table.

Honestly, my fiance and I can't wait to go back! I probably will never get anything other than the dan dan because I loved it so much. But I want to try some of the other rotating bao buns!"}
{"text":"Excellent Ramen shop with creative and delicious food. The staff was very welcoming and gave me great suggestions about which options to try. 

I started with a Bao Bun. They serve vegetarian and meat and they both change daily.  I was quite impressed by the flavors and the overall quality. 

The ramen came next and was delicious. I ordered the Dan Dan, which has a fusion of Chinese and Korean taste sensations, a Kim Chee sweet and fermented sour, along with echoes of Schezwan spice. The noodles are made in house and the quality is excellent. 

I was impressed by the vegetarian options and the passion and commitment of the servers. 

Definitely a place to put on your list!"}
{"text":"Totally surpassed my expectations. This was the first ramen I have had that I really loved. I ordered the vegetarian curry ramen and added chili paste and edamame. Broth was on point, not too over powering but so full of flavor and noodles were beyond perfect. The layout inside is really cool, there is a casual sitting area on the main floor, bar seating upstairs where you can watch your food being made and an actual bar downstairs. Staff was super personable and knowledgeable about the menu. Our waitress was able to give us great recommendations. Can't wait to see the full menu!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for something noodly and warm. A block of maruchan couldn't satisfy my ramen craving. I needed the real thing. 

I showed up at a great time, around 3pm after the lunch rush and before the dinner crowd. Initially I planned to do take out, but the bartender, host, and servers were so friendly that I took a window seat. 

The menu had few chef-created options, but a ton of add-ons. I picked the inferno ramen. My ramen came quickly, piping hot and so spicy it cleared my sinuses :) The fried chicken skin was crispy and savory. 
The flavor was multilayered and changed based on the combination of meat/veggies/noodles in the spoon. The beef was so tender and had a good amount of fat attached. I was halfway done with the broth before realizing I had barely touched the noodles. I briefly panicked about being too full to finish my bowl, but my server assured me that the ramen reheats just as deliciously. She recommended that I swirl the hot geyser egg after reheating to send eggy bits everywhere. It was just as good the first time!

I can't wait to visit Ki Ramen again. Next time I'll order double beef and extra fried chicken skin."}
{"text":"Wonderful!!!  Ramen was delicious and the staff was friendly and food came out quick .  Pig ears were so yummy.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Service was key, ppl were friendly, meal was delicious.  Not for the faint of heart as the dishes are off the wall.... maybe hit or miss to some less adventurous diners but to me.... totally satisfying.  I had an egg dish with lots of goodies involved.. can't remember what but.... combined with a bit of warm sake, the jigae warmed the gut.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Fridays ago with my wife for dinner.  We had been looking forward to trying Ki Ramen even since we heard of its addition in Lawrenceville.  Whenever my wife and I arrived the place was packed and they told us that it would take 15-20 minutes before our table would be ready.  They took down our number which was nice since there wasn't really anywhere to wait in the restaurant and we were free to roam around Lawrenceville.  Around 15 minutes later my phone rang and we headed back and were seated at a two top in the main dining restaurant.  Ki Ramen consists of large dining room, a loft area and then what looked to be a downstairs basement all with seating.  It was rather sparsely decorated with huge open walls with only lights on them.

For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to start off by splitting the cavalfiore (fried cauliflower) and then I also went with the meat bao which was pork on this day.  Then for our entrees I went with the inferno ramen while my wife went with the miso ramen.  Our cavalfiore came out first as a huge chunk of cauliflower.  I don't know if I would have called it fried but it definitely tasted pretty good, especially the crunchy sesame paste (I originally thought it was peanut butter but a fellow Yelper corrected me and so I updated this to reflect that) which gave the cauliflower some sweetness as well as texture.  Whenever we were about half way through that the rest of our meal came out.  I ended up trying the bao first and thought it was alright.  It's bun reminded me of the outside of a Yorkshire pudding while the pork and vegetables inside were good.  Thankfully my ramen was a whole lot better.  I enjoyed the beef, cabbage and onsen egg (sous vide) from my dish but the real star was the broth.  It was flavorful and spicy giving everything that it touched a little heat without going too far over the top.  The only downfall from my dish was the crispy chicken skin which was served half submerged in my broth.  So while half of it was nice and crispy, the other half was soggy and defeated the purpose of even having it. 

The bottom line for me is that I would come back here again in the future.  While I didn't leave the restaurant full and ended up having a snack shortly after getting home, I did really enjoy both the cavalfiore and inferno ramen."}
{"text":"The best ramen in the city. As a Korean, I was impressed that kimchi was authentic, not what I expect in Asian restaurants. Had Dan Dan ramen and I am willing to order it again. My husband has shoyu ramen and he liked it, although the broth didn't have a deep enough flavor."}
{"text":"Americanized, yet it is the rare good ramen restaurant in Pittsburgh. My friends and I went there right after the opening, so food came out a little bit late, but service got faster after a while.
Broth was good and light (not as oily). Noodles were a little bit not fully cooked (but still tasted good- maybe it is supposed to be hard?). Portion was good for women guest but I think guys can still eat more. The atmosphere was very clean and tidy and spacious. It was surprising that they charge extra $1 for spicy sauce. However they also offer spice powders and msg (funny how they laid it out there). Overall it is decent restaurant. I might visit once again in near future."}
{"text":"Found this place on a whim.. was out of my way but tried it anyway- OMG so so good!! Totally worth the trip"}
{"text":"Very cool place in larryville
It's one of my favorite things done by successful restaurants, they do one thing and they do it really well!
They have 6 \"base\" ramen dishes, that you can add to with all of your favorites, extra noodles, crispy chicken skin and tons of veggies.
They also have snacks and other things but you will be happy with just the ramen
I ordered the inferno ramen which was incredible!
It came with thinly sliced beef shank and a soft boiled egg. The broth is complex and spicy and very tasty.
It's a cool crowd and they have a wide selection of beers and wine."}
{"text":"It's simply ok. The fried cauliflower was good. The Kim chi was alright. The ramen was pretty bland. There is better ramen to be had in Pgh than this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch and found the spot very welcoming. The vibe is good and ambiance is trendy and fun. I took a spot by the window to people watch on a sunny afternoon.

I'm pretty into ramen and try to find various takes when traveling or at home. This was my first trip to Ki Ramen and I ordered the Shoyu ramen, feeling chicken broth would cure this crazy spring weather. The broth is tasty--good flavors. Ramen noddles itself are fine, a bit harder than I like and a bit bland. As for the toppings, the cabbage could have been softened and the onsen egg was a little too soft for my taste. (It's softer than a soft-boiled egg.) There are some spice and flavor seasoning on the table (chilli pepper, black peppercorn, and MSG), but nothing that is real heat. I suspect that the red heat that I'm accustomed to with ramen is an extra topping option that I saw on the menu for $1. 

The size of the bowl is sufficient and filling. Not big enough to have leftovers. It's a good spot and service was really great. I might try other items like the sides and baos next time."}
{"text":"Service was terrible (they never put our order in) and when we asked for our food after over an hour of waiting, they said they would make up for the mistake with a discount... it was $2. Never going back; food was nowhere near worth the price or the poor service."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meals at Ki Ramen! (first time at a ramen place) We started with the fried cauliflower. It had a nice pepper blend sauce on it!  We both enjoyed it. I ordered the bowl with beef and added edamame  and my boyfriend ordered the vegetarian bowl and added the pork shoulder to it. I loved the list of add on's and spices available (you could probably make your own bowl). 

We arrived around 6:30 on a Saturday. There was a crowd, but we beat the rush and did not have to wait (when we left around 7:30 there was a wait for tables). I had never had ramen before, so I am glad we came here!"}
{"text":"First impressions matter and this place didn't really wow me.  I started at the downstairs bar with a happy hour cocktail.  There were a bunch of flies buzzing around and the entire area smelled like a backed up drain - just a sour sewer smell.   After that drink, we moved to a table upstairs.  

The server there was friendly, but there were a couple of misses in the service.  The biggest one was the order of delivery.  I wasn't in the mood for ramen, so I ordered a selection of appetizers as my meal.  My companion did a bowl of ramen.  All of my food came out a good 15 minutes before her ramen.  The server didn't really seem to care or notice this faux pas.  

As for the food, it was hit and miss.  I got both bao buns - the meat and veg.  They were good, but not great and a little small for the $6 each price tag.  The gyoza were really good, but my second one was apparently not sealed right and was full of boiling hot oil.   The spring roll itself was good and filling, but the sauce was bland.   Overall, I just wasn't wowed.   

All in all, there are better places to get a bowl of ramen. The smell and the service didn't make me want to return."}
{"text":"Hate to be a debbie downer but if you had good ramen, this place is going to disappoint you! The ramen is tasteless, the atmosphere is nice but it's dark and our waiter was not too attentive. We came on a Friday night to try this new place since it had good reviews but we were quite disappointed.

We ordered the miso ramen with an onsen egg and the inferno ramen for our main dishes. We also got the fried pig ears and a beef bao. As mentioned, the ramen was tasteless. My miso ramen came with a big piece of squash. I've never had ramen with that before and I wasn't a big fan of it. I tried the inferno ramen and the only thing was that it was spicy but the broth had no flavor. The pig ears and bao came out after our ramen. The bao was oily and had too much sauce. The pig ears was so oily and had no taste but salt. Overall, I won't be coming back as I don't think it was worth spending over $45 for the meal. We actually went to another restaurant after since we were not satisfied with the food in terms of quality and quantity."}
{"text":"I don't get what the hype is all about. The broth was not warm and flavourful but was cold and confusing. A very half-assed effort when it comes to the service and the food."}
{"text":"Overall okay experience. I got the curry ramen which was not the most flavorful. I liked my friends' dishes better, for example the dan dan was good. One thing I was disappointed with is the size of the beer. I ordered a draft and it came in a very small glass. It was much smaller than a typical draft glass but the same price. Service was good."}
{"text":"I've been here about four or six times. More than enough to form an opinion about it. 

Their ramens are delicious and have a variety of extras you can add to them. 

My only reason for the lack of 5 stars is, after having tried several bowls, their ramen broths dishes don't seem terribly different from one another. 

If you're itching for a bowl of noodles of any kind, you won't be disappointed. If you come one a weekend, come early or bring your patience with you. They get packed!"}
{"text":"This is one of those reviews that I really wish I could give 3.5 stars. Ki Ramen has great potential, but it just doesn't quite hit the right flavor notes to make this a 4+ star experience. I really enjoyed the ambiance, the service was great, and my cocktail was delicious, but the food is just average. We started with the fried Cauliflower which was texturally perfect, but there was nothing flavor wise that really made it pop. This was also the theme with the ramen that we had, chicken and inferno, it was all there except for the flavor to really set the dish apart, there just aren't enough layers to really get you excited for that next bite. I will most likely come here again, but I don't see this establishment as anything more than a great place to meet with some friends for a cocktail. Hopefully I'm wrong, but from my experience I can name a dozen or so better places to grab a bite in Lawrenceville."}
{"text":"Noodle crisis averted! My husband and I stumbled in to this joint after walking the streets of Larry ville this Saturday afternoon. We sat at the bar by the window to indulge in more people watching.

It took a bit of time to actually be waited on. Once the waitress took our order, it took even longer to get our food. We later found out that they had a busier than expected lunch rush and ran out of noodles! Over all, it was worth the wait.

We ordered the fried cauliflower, crispy pig ears, and sho yu ramen. I highly suggest the two appetizers. They are unique, tasty, and only $4 each. The ramen was good! But I wanted something more from it. Next time I'll order something spicy or add some more fixins.

4 stars because service was molasses! We'll be back though!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this.  Very friendly and welcoming staff which is always important and makes the experience so much better.  The food tho was not impressive.  The noodles felt old and the soup was overall a little cold. The broth tho was tasty and the menu is friendly for vegetarians that I appreciate as there are 3 options our of total of 6-7 ramen dishes."}
{"text":"They offer several vegetarian options. Our waiter was very friendly. Service was quick. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The ramen noodle is really great. You can taste the freshness. And the spice is also good. 

The portion is quite small compared to authentic Japanese ramen bar. Also the bun is not authentic, it's very Americanized. 

The waitress is kind not in good mode that night. We asked twice to get water refilled."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now. While the atmosphere and space is great, the menu has been hit or miss. The miso eggplant was a hard pass. Honestly looked like a Dead Sea animal slathered in topping. It was sliced but not all the way through which made it next to impossible to eat with chopsticks. We pretty much had to fight to tear it to pieces. The taste wasn't bad but the longer I looked at it, the harder it was to eat. My partner really enjoyed the Inferno Ramen. Definitely high on the spicy scale, which we love. The noodle texture is slightly gummy, if you care about that. The Miso Ramen left a lot to be desired. The Curry Ramen on the other hand, is great. By far my favorite. I come back specifically for that.    The nitamago egg was absolutely amazing. Overall excited to see what is to come from this place!"}
{"text":"This is a cute new ramen spot right on Butler! The ramen was delicious but that was about it. 

We were seated near the upstairs bar. It was a little crowded and pretty hot. We waited quite a while to order drinks and even longer to order food. We ordered the fried cauliflower and miso eggplant to start but they seemed to forget about them.  We had some questions about the add ons for the ramen but our server seemed more annoyed than wanting to help. We took a shot in the dark. I had the Shoyu Ramen with an Onsen Egg add on. I would definitely get it again! 

However, we got our bowls of ramen and still no sight of our appetizers. Once we found our server and asked about them she just said said they take a while... they were good once they finally came out but not worth the wait. 

Overall, this is a cute spot with great ramen but the service was lacking."}
{"text":"***** Snacks
*** Ramen
**** Setting
+1* for the nitamago (6 min egg) and crispy chicken skin
--------
Small little diner/bar that is perhaps slightly overrated at the point.  Love the atmosphere. Best for 2 ppl (Friday night, 2 was a walk-in. 4 was a 25 min wait and 6 was even longer.)

Snacks were fantastic. Grilled Miso Eggplant is a cold appetizer. Fresh and light.  Fried cauliflower is a hot appetizer.  The sauce seems to have peanut butter, so watch out if you are allergic to nuts.  But it was really good and should try. 

Ramen was so-so. My Inferno Ramen was hot and salty., and that was it.  I wish the broth can stand out a bit, and less salty. The spiciness was good but with no dimension to it.  Extra point for Nitamago (6 min egg) and crispy chicken skin.  Egg was done to perfection and texture of crispy chicken skin was great.  But they dont bring taste to the ramen.  so it's lacking a bit. 

Room for improvement.  Might give it a second chance later."}
{"text":"Ramen was Ok.  Ordered an alcoholic drink which came with the ramen.  My husband ordered an appetizer which never arrived, and we asked if they planned to bring it for dessert?  Others at different tables received them as they should've.  Bill came and was charged an extra dollar for ice!  It was explained that when drinks are ordered on the rocks, it comes as a larger pour.  Since my drink arrived with my ramen, it wasn't finished, I couldn't believe this."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here the other night after running through our normal list of dinner spots, and we decided to try this because it was new.

They had a special appetizer (I can't remember the name) that was delicious. A fried bun with fried chicken and kimchi. It was so good. We love steamed buns but this was a great variation. 

I ordered the Shio Ramen which had pork belly, crispy friend pork ears, scallions, and soft boiled egg. The noodles were perfect and the broth had a great flavor. I can absolutely see myself coming here regularly for some ramen during the colder months. I think it will hit the spot.

We ordered draft beers. They were smaller than I expected, but we also ordered a 9.7% beer, so that's probably fine!

The staff are efficient and friendly. We got to sit right in front of the kitchen which was a cool experience. They did a great job with a big space.

This restaurant is a wonderful addition to Lawrenceville and I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am Asian-American (although not Japanese), and from California. This what I'm comparing Ki Ramen to.

I got there for lunch and order the Shio Ramen since I wanted meat. I substituted the egg for the soft boiled one and added enoki mushroom since there didn't seem to many vegetables in the dish. The service was good and the ambiance is nice. The crispy pig ear was the best part of the dish. The meat was super fatty, but I like fatty meat.

The mushrooms and egg didn't add much value as the soup was so salty. Although the bowl had a lot of flavor, it was distracting with the salt. It's been 5+ hours and it's still all I can taste after downing a bunch of water: They also charge you for chili, which I should have been more aware of. Most places don't charge me for that.

At the end of the day, $16 before tip is very expensive for medium-quality and very very salty ramen."}
{"text":"Overall: 3.5
Food: 5/5
Service: 1/5

The ramen was very delicious. It seemed to gain flavor and richness throughout the meal. The ingredients were fresh, the noodles were cooked well, and it had the perfect amount of salt and spice. We shared some buns for an appetizer, which were also really good-- I highly recommend the miso eggplant. 

While the hostess was so kind, informative, and friendly, our server was truly awful. He seemed very irritated to be working, he used one word responses, he forgot my friend's beer, and he hurriedly told us the specials before we had even sat down. Also, the restaurant was very loud even though there were open tables.

I will be back to enjoy the food and hope that they can get the service / noise figured out so this can be another hot spot in Lawrenceville!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Saturday around 5:00 after finishing the Lawrenceville Cookie Tour. There were only two of us, so we were seated quickly and there were a few other tables for small groups at that hour.

I'm not sure I've had ramen too many other times to compare, but I really enjoyed my meal. The boiled egg was perfectly cooked and the chicken in the shoyu ramen was very tender and tasty. I downed my whole bowl and I also downed a TON of water. So it was very salty, but it didn't taste overpoweringly so. The karakuchi sake was mild and tasty and service was friendly. I found the menu a little pricy for the base items and because of that I didn't add anything on, though some of the add ons looked pretty good! Despite that, I had a good experience and I'll probably be back-after I hunt down other ramen restaurants to see where this clocks in!"}
{"text":"Came in with a friend on a Saturday night and we were immediately seated, which is nice. The waitress was informative about the menu, but a little slow with service. She also forgot to ring in my bao bun, causing a delay with my food.

Food was really nice, I opted for the inferno ramen with kimchi replacing the egg. The ramen was good and spicy, but the brisket was too fatty for my taste. I also had a pork belly bao bun, which was AMAZING. The pork was cooked perfectly and the bao was delicious. I have never had a steamed bun where they sear the edges and make the bun a little crispy, and I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 3.5 stars. 

I've heard from several people that this place was great so I was a little shocked that it didn't have better reviews. I've never had ramen before other then top ramen of course! Everyone raves about how great ramen is so I was disappointed that I wasn't really impressed.  

The majority of the ramen is made with a mix of pork broth and chicken broth so my options were only 3 ramen bowls. I went with the dan dan. It had a little heat to it since there was kimchi in the soup. I didn't care for the egg in it though. The noodles could be cooked a little more too. My table started with the fried cauliflower. It was ok but not great. 

Not sure if I'll try ramen again. Just wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"A few of us got together on a Wednesday night to check out the new noodle place. There were no tables available when we arrived so we decided to sit at the high tops along the wall looking at the street. Great people watching spot as long as you're ok with people from the street watching you eat as well! I got the miso eggplant appetizer to share which when it came out looked like a slug on a plate but was actually quite delicious. For the main dish I got the vegetarian curry but I added the chili paste to add a little spice. Again this was very good and adding the chili really gave it that extra kick it needed. The meal was good and I'd recommend people to definitely try. My only and biggest complaint was the service. Our waitress was not friendly, probably very busy, but was pretty much like what do you want and that was it. I had to practically wave her down to get a second drink which didn't arrive until she came over when we were finished and noticed I still hadn't received my drink. I mentioned I didn't want it unless it was already made and she gave it to me after we received our checks. I'm not asking for a free drink but if you're going to give it to me after I'm finished when I ordered it half way through the meal something would have been appreciated. Overall food was good, service something to be desired."}
{"text":"I first ate ramen in Charlotte, NC and fell in love. I loved it so much, I didn't think I would enjoy anywhere else. But I was wrong. This place was awesome! The atmosphere is very modern and hipster. You have three options to sit, in the dining area, the bar area, or the kitchen area. We chose the kitchen area and it was great! We ordered the fried cauliflower as a snack and it was delicious! I ordered the shio ramen and ate every bite. The only thing I would change is the pig ear. It was my first time trying it, and now I can check that off my list. I certainly wouldn't care if I ever eat it again. The customer service was great, and sitting in the kitchen area we got to talk to the chef. It was a great experience all around, and look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I loved Ki Ramen! I had a friend go here a few months ago for their birthday and they told me that they were not impressed. Luckily, I did not listen! My best girlfriend was in town and I needed to go to Wild Card for a birthday gift (I get every gift there) so we wanted to stay in the general area. I've been on a spicy soup kick and thought that Ki Ramen would be a good option! We both ordered the same thing, the meat bao of the day and the inferno ramen. The boa was ok. It was a play on an Italian beef with rapini, and horseradish. Not bad but the meat was fatty and only a small amount was given. My ramen though...out of control.I added enoki mushrooms and chili paste. The soup was so perfectly spicy. I drank all of the broth because it was so flavorful and delicious. Dreaming about my next meal at Ki Ramen and I can't wait to try Ki Pollo!"}
{"text":"Maybe a little more expensive than I'd like (a few dollars could be cut from most everything), but it was delicious. I had the inferno. It wasn't that spicy, but it was delicious. The beef shank in it was awesome. The pork shoulder in the bao bun was super good. It was a good experience and I might go again when I'm visiting Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place was ok but the flavor left something to be desired. The waiter was pretentious and not as helpful as desired.

I had a longer review, but accidentally deleted it. Update coming soon."}
{"text":"I wish I could give Ki Ramen a better rating. The  environment was warm and inviting. Our server was pleasant, informative, and attentive. The reason I'm only giving a \"3\" rating is that I was disappointed with the actual food. We shared the vegi Bao and enjoyed it. It had just the right amount of heat and good flavor.   We also shared the  Dan Dan ramen.  Ramen is all about the broth. Even though we ordered the added \"butter bomb\", which supposedly added richness and flavor, I found the broth bland and lacking in the \"mouth -feel\" that you expect. The ramen noodles were just sort of \"there.\" The tofu was rubbery and flavorless, and the additional ingredients (kim chi, scallions, sprouts, and nitamago were skimpy. The dish just didn't cut it. The price, $12 wasn't terrible, but if you added a few of the add ons, Ki Ramen started becoming expensive for what you got. 
I'll probably give Ki Ramen another chance because I really love ramen.  But if my next experience isn't significantly better, I'll cross this place off my list"}
{"text":"Ki Ramen is a Japanese-inspired/fusion kind of ramen house that effuses all the vibes of the next-gen hipster hangout. Although this could be a fun place to grab dinner with friends, the spacing is a bit small, and the dishes (listed below) were not memorable.

Ambiance: A bit loud, I wouldn't say it's the best place to get to know someone on a dinner date. Be prepared to ask your date to repeat him/herself several times while others in very close proximity evesdrops on your conversations.

Service: Receptionists are very nice and accommodating. Our server was very nice. Strangely, he had us waiting at least 20 minutes (I stopped counting) for our check.

Food:
-Kimchi: overall good textures for kimchi, not too soggy but had some crunch to the vegetables. Unfortunately, my date and I (and those eavesdropping) believed that they were fermented too long and consequently tasted way too sour, so beware this kimchi is not for the faint-hearted.

-we shared a large, hearty bowl of shio ramen. The broth was very light, no charsiu typical of more traditional ramen. We had fried pork ears on top, which added a nice savory flavor and crunchy texture to complement the noodles. However, I wouldn't call this ramen but rather an Asian-inspired bowl of noodles, which was still satiating.

Overall a restaurant to go to experience a lively, hip crowd over an Asian-inspired meal. However, I would not recommend for those interested in more traditional tasting ramen but rather prioritize an experience or a night out with friends."}
{"text":"Ki Ramen is in it's soft opening currently. It's open from 5pm to 12am, and it's in an easy location to find in Lawrenceville. The decor is really cute and kitschy, which I personally enjoy.

There are currently 6 ramens on the menu, and there are a couple of snack items as well. I tried the crispy pig ears, the Inferno ramen (spicy beef shank), and the Shoyu ramen (chicken). 

I personally liked the Shoyu ramen best. The chicken inside it was delicious, and both of the broths were very savory. 

The noodles are handpulled at the restaurant. They were very very hard, to the point of being raw still. Now I personally love that, but I know a lot of people like their noodles less chewy than that. 

I'm sure if it was because they were quite busy, but I definitely want to try again to see if the noodles are still as hard next time. 

The food came out quickly! I'm excited to see how the menu continues developing. One thing I wish they had were more Asian drinks--seeing things aside from ginger beer, and getting non-alcoholic drink options such as Ramune, or Calpico, would've made the experience more authentic."}
{"text":"Caveat that I've only been once, and during their soft opening, and that whether you like this restaurant totally depends on your palate. This place is not super authentic, but that may come as no surprise. I found everything we ordered very heavy/oily and salty. My friend and I ordered the cauliflower and pork ramen that has pork ears. The cauliflower was interesting. But when you really think about it, is a pretty simple dish - one whole chunk of cauliflower deep fried and sprinkled with the usual japanese umami seasoning plus a little sesame sauce on the bottom. The first bite is good, but we both felt that the more you eat it, the heavier it gets and the less appetizing. It basically has the oil but not the crunch or texture of tempura. The umami and sesame seasoning isn't amazing and just doesn't cut the grease. Half way though, I found myself wishing the cauliflower wasn't fried at all. The pork ramen we both couldn't finish (and I love my noodles I always finish them) because of how heavy it was. I see a lot of reviews recommending the vegetable curry ramen - if I ever come back here, I'd probably try that?"}
{"text":"A coworker of mine has been telling me about Ki Ramen for months now and I've been so excited to try it. I've only ever had one ramen experience in the past and it left me very disappointed. After hearing my coworker say he was eating here multiple times a week I thought for sure this had to be amazing. While I won't say it was a disappointment I certainly wasn't blown away either.

I started my meal with a order of the spicy cucumbers. Now those blew me away for sure! I could have ordered another order for myself. The $4 price point also wasn't bad. I was a little disappointed in the price point for the Bao Buns. They weren't that big and they were $6 for just one. My friend ended up getting that days vegetarian option and she did say that it was really good. 

Ramen wise I went with the Dan Dan ramen. Since this was basically my first time having ramen I opted to not add anything to my bowl. All in all the bowl was fairly good. I really liked the kim chi mixed in and every bite that had kim chi was by far the best bite. I'm a huge tofu fan but sadly this tofu fell short of expectations. It was a little too tough for me and it was relatively flavorless in my opinion. 

With all of that being said, I would like to give Ki Ramen another try and try another one of the ramen bowls. If you haven't checked it out yet you should give it a try!"}
{"text":"OVERALL: cool atmosphere with average food. Service was great. 

I ordered the inferno ramen at Ki Ramen, and the first thing I'll say is - don't expect them to tone down the spice. I grew up eating spicy food, but even this made me sweat a bit. The taste of the ramen wasn't terrific. I'd say it's pretty average, but it wasn't bad. There are definitely better ramen places in Pittsburgh though, but this place has its perks, such as really friendly service and a chill ambience. 

What I will say though, is that they're interesting with toppings. I had fried chicken skin in my ramen, and while it didn't taste good, it was definitely innovative. If you come here, I would recommend the cauliflower appetizer. That was one of the best cauliflower dishes I've ever had! However, the consensus among my friends and I was that the ramen was at best a 3.5/5. 

I would probably not come here again, but if I do, I wouldn't mind too much. It's decent - just not great compared to other ramen in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is always delicious and the drinks are yummy! The pig ears are super tasty I recommend them to share!"}
{"text":"Great food, poor management. My friend's food came late without being addressed even though the manager was right there. Speaking of the manager- she complained about her personal problems, the staff from earlier in the day all while not addressing the food not coming out. The poor bartender was trying the best she could but she was thrown to the wolves by her manager. Would expect a little better service as they have less than  10 items on their menu and it wasn't a busy night."}
{"text":"We had no wait on a Tuesday night during the soft opening, which was good since they (currently) don't accept reservations. We tried the cauliflower and pig's ear, and opted for the shoyu ramen and the dan dan ramen. The cauliflower was quite tasty, and the server's recommendation of pre-cutting the 1/4 head of cauliflower before using chopsticks was a good one. The only downside to the cauliflower was that the neri goma (Japanese tahini) at the bottom was a bit intensely dark...if it were cut a bit, this would be a phenomenal dish. The pig's ear was tasty, but a bit one-note for the portion size--3-4 slivers of pig's ear were enough to intrigue and satisfy, but there were something like 20 in our portion. This would be great as a topping to another dish, but I feel like a half-size would be a better gateway for most diners.

Onto the ramen--we were disappointed. The MSG, togarashi, and pepper blend on the table are great, but in my experience, the only seasoning you should be adding at the table is hot pepper oil, which was nowhere to be found. The noodles didn't have the typical texture; it felt like they weren't alkalized enough or something. They were also square, making them appear to have been extruded or cut rather than pulled. The shoyu broth was well-flavored, but lacked the unctuousness typical of ramen (curiously, the ramen we ate at Umami, Li's other restaurant, last year had this unctuousness, but was over-salted). Then dan dan broth was great--right amount of heat and richness. I'll keep looking for a place in PGH that does traditional (miso/shoyu/tonkotsu) ramen well, but this place is a decent option if you're in Lawrenceville when the craving strikes."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to take my family to get good ramen. Having lived in Korea and visited many parts of Japan, I was pretty disappointed with the quality of the ramen and ingredients used in our meal. First, the chasu wasn't real chasu. It was just steamed or boiled pork. Second, the noodles which should be the most important part of the ramen was sub quality and something they would never serve in Japan, not even at the $2 ramen stands.  Lastly, my wife's ramen lacked enough broth to cover the noodles, so we asked for more. Little did we know until the check had arrived, we were charged for the broth although it should have been part of the ramen in the first place. 

It isn't that I have high standards, I don't think many costumers coming to Ki Ramen has any idea what they should expect."}
{"text":"The food here was very unique for \"ramen house\". My friend and I got the cauliflower, eggplant and meat bun to start. The cauliflower I didn't really enjoy as I didn't think it had a lot of flavor but everything else including the ramen was great. I liked how you were able to customize your ramen to what you want to add in and take off the premade menu"}
{"text":"Definitely not a place to go when you already feel hungry. We wait for more than an hour to get our order. The noodle didn't seem to fully cooked and the broth is salty. Would not come back"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Friday afternoon with a friend. 

We both ordered the inferno ramen with added kimchi and a a steamed pork bun. 

The ramen was tasty! The broth had some heat but it certainly wasn't unbearable. The ramen bowl was full of perfectly aldente noodles, tender brisket, a deliciously poached egg, and soft cabbage. The pork bun was delicious as well. It was sweet and the meat was tender and Smokey. The bun was also very palatable, although I do prefer a more sticky steamed bun than fried.

I really liked the fact that they do not cook with MSG, but have it in a shaker at the table if you so wish to add some Unami to your dish. 

Service was great, very attentive and knowledgeable waitress. 

Will certainly be back again."}
{"text":"This is not good ramen. The broth is flavorless which is half of the ramen equation and they fail at making solid ramen broth. Their noodles are nothing to write home about. This is subpar ramen and you shouldn't spend your money here.

A couple of points to consider:
1. Their drinks are OVER PRICED! A friend ordered a beer and it was a 10oz glass for $6! Do these people know their customer base?
2. They were out of meat baos and other small items on their menu at 5pm on a Wednesday. Really?
3. They offer you 1 bao for $6. If that isn't robbery I don't know what is. 
4. They won't seat you until all in the party are there. It's a stupid rule regardless of the place doing it. This place applies that rule even though the restaurant was nearly empty. I questioned them on this and got some response where they assumed I was going to be with people that were always late.
5. Our waitress was fake af. Saw right through her faux positive attitude.
6. I live in NYC and the ramen there is pretty epic. One item that they have as an add on in NYC restaurants is corn, a basic item to add to ramen. My fake af waitress told me that they took it off the menu because it wasn't fresh any more. Really? They draw the line at fresh corn? Give me a break.
7. It was 20 degrees that night and everytime someone came through the front door the whole front seating area was bathed in cold frigid air. How about putting up a curtain to block that? They're lack of attention to detail is pathetic.

I wouldn't go back to this place if they paid for my next meal. It's not good. I'm not sure of the other Pittsburgh ramen places, but if this is the best Pittsburghers are seriously missing out on respectable ramen.

Oh, and plus, 3 of the people in my party felt ill after their meal, and I was left still hungry.

In summary, go somewhere else. If you think this is good ramen, your horizons need to be expanded."}
{"text":"Our waitress was very friendly and was able to tell us everything about the menu, which was very helpful.  We started with the gyoza and we enjoyed it. They were stuffed with pork - some places I find there is just a trace of meat inside.  

I have mixed opinion on the ramen.  We both got the shoyu ramen.  The ramen tasted good (but salty) as did the chicken.  But we both felt there should have been more noodles in the bowl, and I would get additional chicken next time.  I added the brussel sprouts to my ramen but was disappointed in them."}
{"text":"Good ramen in a nice space with adventurous/interesting cocktails and a staff eager to impress. Most of the ramen dishes are made with a double broth, but there is a vegetarian option available. Order a base and a few add-ins and enjoy a nice slurp-deserving meal. A bit too expensive.

I'm looking forward to those bitter winter nights when all I really want is a nice, hearty soup to fill the void from where the warm weather used to be. You better believe I'll be craving some Ki Ramen with an egg, some mushrooms, and nori."}
{"text":"Fusion for sure.  If you enjoy a different rendition of many familiar dishes.  Ki Ramen will surely hit your taste buds favorably.  We have been to the restaurant two times and both were exceptional dinners.  It does take a bit of tasting and tasting again to get the full flavors of their fusion dishes, but they were all different and wonderful."}
{"text":"The food was okay but nothing really stood out. Nice that they have hot sake ready at all times."}
{"text":"For a place that serves ramen noodles, you'd think they'd have cooking the actual noodles down. My noodles came all bunched together and not cooked all the way through. The add-ons were barely noticeable and the broth was thicker than I'd like and very salty. My family members all also thought this place was just \"meh\".

Ramen Bar in Squirrel Hill is 10x better. If you want ramen noodle soup done well - go there. 

I will not be going to Ki Ramen again."}
{"text":"Welcome to town Ki Ramen. I have been excited to have a reamen option in Pittsburgh. We went tonight, it was good! They are new and I think this place can only go up from here!  My only thing is I wish the broth was a little bit hotter. The flavors were wonderful and I love the soft drink options."}
{"text":"Really good ramen, especially for Pittsburgh. I ordered the eggplant appetizer and the miso ramen. I loved the eggplant appetizer, it was plate-licking good! The miso ramen was pretty good too, however I feel that the noodles need to be a tad more delicious. I wish they offered different choices of noodles we could pick from. Overall a cool place which I look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Great spot. Great location. I wish they had a larger selection of Japanese Whiskey. Ki Ramen is the closest I've had in Pittsburgh to Ramen in Japan."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place after reading all of the great reviews. Plus, the photos of the food look amazing.
I absolutely hate writing negative reviews, but this was just so disappointing. I'm not a terribly picky eater and can usually enjoy anything, and I hate to say it, but it's probably the worst food I've eaten in years.

Decided to try it. The wait staff was great, but the food was awful; bf's noodles were chewy, some of the pork was decent, but cut too big and other parts were firm and stringy, \"crispy pig ears\" were chewy. 
I was concerned when I saw how fast the food came out because to make good ramen and eggs usually takes a bit. I am totally happy and willing to wait for good ramen.

Their bao buns are $6 for 1 bun(most places are 2 for $6 and better) and the bread was crisp and firmer instead of your typical soft ones. It was good, but not what I want when I'm looking for a bao bun.

Technique was just off on everything and additionally the food made both me and my bf feel sick, and I have an iron stomach. I never don't finish my food regardless of how much I dislike it, but I couldn't even get halfway through.

So sad to write this, but wish I had seen a review like this before trying it.

Additionally their seating rules are really odd. They had plenty of seating available, but we had to wait for a 2 seater. I get it if it's busier,but there were tons of empty spots. Really weird.

Will stick to Yuzu Kitchen from now on. If you're looking for good ramen and bao buns, they're the best I've found in Pitt so far."}
{"text":"I was initially very excited to see a ramen spot open up in Pittsburgh! This restaurant is settled into Butler street area within Pittsburgh and fits very well this neighborhood's trendy vibe. I was not entirely happy with the meal, the ramen noodles were not entirely cooked and in order to have a satisfying ramen meal, you had to order a lot of extra sides to add into your bowl..."}
{"text":"Excited this restaurant is now open for lunch! The interior is very clean and minimal, but cute. The sun pouring in through the floor to ceiling windows brightens the front room, but it was also very warm and blinding bright. 

The Shoyu ramen had a very nice well rounded flavor, and not salty at all. My least favorite part of this particular ramen was the mushroom. The mushroom looked interesting, but the texture was unappealing to this reviewer. Perhaps if it was sliced and added. Very filling!

The Interno ramen definitely lives up to its name! Very spicy, and while I enjoy spicy foods this had a nice level of heat, but it was just above my tolerance to enjoy. A few spoonfuls of this broth into the shoyu would have been amazing!

There's three different seasonings on the table including MSG, which is NOT used in any of the dishes but some diners choose to add. 

The bao bun is definitely worth trying.The options change weekly. The meat one for the day had pork, kimchi, and hoisin which was a delicious pairing!"}
{"text":"Awesome low-key atmosphere for excellent Ramen! Dan Dan Ramen is so good for the cured tofu fan and adding chili paste or a dippy egg is the way to go! Interesting beer and wine list that is unique and different! Their apps include pig ears, delicious buns, and great specials nightly! Awesome place in Lawrenceville! Check it out!"}
{"text":"So my star rating isn't a reflective of how I feel. Wish I could give them a 3.5 rather then 3 and I don't feel they deserve a 4. So Friday night was our first time checking them out and it was a very nice ambiance. Great location, room was very well designed, and staff was friendly.

Let's dive into the food... so we tried the pig ears for our starter and they were good. Neither of us had had them before so we did enjoy and thought it was the best start to trying a new place. I couldn't choose between the Dan Dan or Curry so my boyfriend insisted I order both. He had the one with soy chicken the name is leaving me.

His ramen was not good at all. I excepted the flavor profile to be more and it lacked heavily.

Curry, the flavor was okay but I wasn't raving over the bowl and honestly using curry I expected the dish to do more for my palette.

Dan Dan was by far the best and if I had only gotten that would have probably rated them four even with my boyfriend upset over his failed attempt.

My last comment and I know this me being needy. Wish they had more options or a create your own option. I'd return again but only for the Dan Dan which means I probably won't go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Hip, but the ramen is nothing special. The pig ears were kind of good. The cucumber app was Oaky. Best thing I tried was the eggplant appetizer (it's cold), I thought it was delicious. I might be back if all my friends pressure me into it, but I won't be thrilled. At least it's not expensive."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my visit to Ki Ramen last night. We started with the fried cauliflower which was delicious - the waiter gave us a fork and knife to cut it up so no issues there.

I got the Tiki Punch which was super refreshing and perfect for a summer day. Ramen wise - I got the Inferno which was very yummy with the soy butter ball. Really enjoyed the noodles, broth, egg, beef - the fried chicken skin was delicious but a little heavy for my taste.

Will absolutely return and recommend to all for good in da burgh."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time last night. The restaurant has a cool vibe. I loved the decor. There weren't many people there at 6 on a Thursday so I was seated right away. Service was friendly and fast. I ordered the fig n'at cocktail, which was tasty but maybe a tad on the too sweet side for my taste. It was good though. I also had the sake beer, which I had been meaning to try for a while. I ordered the crispy pig ears, I think my dog would have loved them. They had a peppery flavor on them, similar to what was on the table. The meat was just more fatty and less crispy, than i was expecting. Probably wouldn't get them again. 
I ordered the beer shank inferno Ramen, which had a great salty/peppery flavor. I wouldn't say it was overly spicy, as the name would suggest. The beef was moist and tender, the egg was eggy, and the cabbage was a good addition for texture. My friends ordered the veggie curry and the shoyu ramen. Their broths were both seasoned perfectly as well. My friend loved her shoyu ramen, which had a peanut buttery flavor with some extra spice from the chile paste. I would probably order that one next time. 

The end."}
{"text":"Okay friends this place got another star because I tried there vegetarian ramen dish and was blown away. It was literally so good that I almost didn't even save half for lunch the next day. I was that much of a hog. The vegetarian ramen dish has squash and mushrooms in it with a very mild broth. The problem was that I really wish that the squash wasn't a big hunk of squash and was maybe in cubed form. Was a little hard to eat with a chopstick since it was literally the side of a squash plopped right in the middle of the bowl but I'm telling you this dish was out of this world. We also went earlier so there wasn't that many people there and it wasn't loud or crowded which really made me feel a lot more comfortable than the last time that I was there. I think for me that coming earlier would be the best bet since the night-time crowd is a little bit too loud and crowded for my delicate constitution. I look forward to getting this dish again and trying maybe some of the appetizers the next time that I venture over one street from where I live to get some Ramen. Yum yum in my tum. I'm serious the vegetarian dish is the way to go. Try it out and tell me what your thoughts are. I want to know if anyone else likes this broth and this dish a lot better than any of the meat dishes that they serve."}
{"text":"I read mixed reviews of Ki Ramen, but decided I had to try it out for myself.  We went in at lunch time and placed an order to go.  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  Our order was ready extraordinarily quickly. I ordered the Dan Dan ramen with the butter bomb and the vegetarian bao bun.  My partner had the inferno ramen and the meat bao bun.  He ordered a butter bomb in his ramen too but we were pretty sure they forgot to give it to him.  He also felt that the inferno ramen could be slightly spicier as the name leads you to believe.  Overall though we really really liked the food.  The house-made noodles were wonderful.  We really appreciated the thoughtful packaging of the to go order (broth separate from noodles and toppings) so that our food did not get soggy before we got a chance to eat it!  We will definitely be coming back to Ki Ramen!"}
{"text":"I'm a big Ramen fan and Ki Ramen has definitely passed the test. It's a very subtle food to get right. If even one thing is off, it can change the whole dish. This, however, was on point.

I got the Inferno Ramen and loved everything about it. It's a good level of spice where your mouth isn't melting off, but you can still feel the heat. The egg is soft boiled and the noodles are scrumptious.

The atmosphere is very pleasing. It's not too loud and the lighting is low. I love the bar seating because it puts the bowl right at mouth height and gives you that authentic Ramen feel. It's really roomy inside and has a lot of tables so it isn't too difficult to get seated even on a busy night.

All of the staff were really nice and accommodating, we didn't want for anything. I will definitely be coming back here to fulfill my Ramen craves."}
{"text":"Honestly. This place is the shit. I feel sorry for anyone who gave this a negative review. Shaking my head..."}
{"text":"I had the spicy ramen which was really good if you pretended it wasn't ramen! I liked that they tried to change up the typical components of ramen at this hip ramen joint. For example, they substituted ultra tender brisket for chashu and a lightly poached egg for nitamago. They also offered a Gorgonzola butter ball that you can add to your ramen, but I have to admit my enthusiasm for adventure has its limits. 

They do not accept reservations and I have to say turnover at this restaurant is rather slow for a ramen bar. Drinks were reasonably priced (a pint of Sapporo for $5) and the service was excellent. The gentleman who seated us (Jeff) did a fantastic job welcoming us to the restaurant and highlighted the specials on the menu. 

I think this restaurant is in a great location and I like that they have a straightforward and edited menu, although I can't really get behind all the daring combinations of soups that they have created. It is simply challenging for me as a ramen purist. However, the bowl that I had, although I wouldn't call it ramen, tasted good. Lastly, I am slightly insulted that they would charge $13 for a bowl of ramen in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Tried four different noodle ramen dishes.
They were delicious.  Maybe the one with kimchi was the best.
Overall, the impression is that for the price, the noodles quantity was on the low side (but were very good, freshly made...)"}
{"text":"My friend and I were excited for the soft opening of Ki Ramen! Since it was a soft opening, their menu was limited with 3 different types of ramen and some add ons. I went with the vegetarian curry ramen, which had tamarind, scallion, coconut milk, cabbage, cauliflower, wakame and miso. I added an onsen egg and porcini-chili butter bomb. My friend had the shoyu ramen, which consisted of soy braised chicken, scallion, kikurage, onsen egg and cabbage. The ramen prices were reasonable with mine being $11 and then the add ons were each $2.  

Our only complaint was that the wait was kind of long. Since there were only three items on the menu, we did not expect the wait to be so long. We were seated on the upper level, where the kitchen was located. There is a main level where you walk in and then a lower level, so there is plenty of seating! 

When the food finally came, we were very satisfied. My vegetarian curry broth was so flavorful and the noodles were perfectly cooked. The onsen egg was also a nice addition with the yolk adding a lot of flavor to the broth. It was a nice change from the traditional soft boiled egg. My friend also was very pleased with her shoyu ramen. She said her broth was very tasty and it was one of the best ramens she has had. 

I look forward to coming back and trying their full menu! An excellent collaboration between two great chefs of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I was in the area and wanted to grab some dinner to go. I walked in and was greeted by a very friendly host. She handed me a menu and told me to let her know if I had any questions. 
This was my first time eating out at any ramen establishment but the menu was straightforward enough that I was easily able to pick an app and a main dish. I got the fried cauliflower and the Dan Dan noodles (~$17). 

I waited inside and the place was bustling the entire time, though, it was not overly noisy, which is good. It was happy and fun yet light and casual. 

My food was ready in no time! When I got home, the cauliflower was a bit too greasy, and yes I realize it was fried! The noodles were good but tasted much better after I added some sriracha and cilantro. 

All in all it was a pleasant experience. Would go back and see if I can bump it up from 3.5 to a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"My first time at an all Ramen restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised. The broth is a good place to start.  It was rich, luxurious and very flavorful.  I had the Inferno it was yummy.  The beef shank was very flavorful and the chicken skin, oh my and then there is that egg that bursts into broth adding even more silliness and richness to the flavor.   The fried cauliflower appetizer was very unassuming but awesome...couldn't stop eating it.  My daughter got the ramen with the pig ears (which she didn't like) so I had an added bonus to my ramen!!!  They were cooked to perfection as well.  Give yourself an added bonus and ask to sit in the kitchen!!"}
{"text":"We ate at Ki Ramen on a recent trip to Pittsburgh. It is a cute place, we sat in the main dinning area when you first enter. We got the meat Bao and Curry ramen. The Bao bread was really good and had interesting flavors. The ramen was a huge portion - we shared it. It was creamy, spicy and delicious. We also ordered sake and wine which were both tasty. The staff was friendly and kind, prices were pretty good. 

It was a cozy place with low lights, nice for dates of groups. The high top seating along the window looked really cold. The music was good but had us laughing -- an interesting mix of 90s hip hop, a few other old school songs, and current music.

I took a star off for a few things that were not a huge deal but we would have wanted to go a little smoother. There were several tables open throughout the main dinning area and they sat us directly next to one couple and directly behind another. Our waiter was a bit slow when we wanted to order a glass of wine and again when we wanted our check even though it did not seem super busy."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on a freezing cold late Saturday afternoon.  We found street parking and rushed to get inside.  It wasn't too busy when we first got here.  We were greeted by the hostess and sat right down at a two seater.

 We had looked over the menu a little bit before we came here so we sort of knew what we wanted.  Our waitress was nice and she came over to ask us if we had ever been here before and if we would like her to explain the menu.  We let her and she did a good job explaining everything to us.

 We ordered their Meat Bao bun that had Oyster in it to start us off.  For our main dish I ordered the Shoyu Ramen and my wife got the Inferno Ramen.
 
Our Bao came out within 10 minutes.  It looked good. Our waitress said that if we were sharing it they would cut it in half for us but they didn't but  no big deal we cut it and shared the bun.  The actually bun was good but we felt that it needed more filling.  It was a lot more bun and less Oyster.  It was good but we have tasted better.
 
Our Ramen came out about ten minutes later.  Our dishes looked really good and we were hungry.  My wife liked her dish and you can read her review on her Ramen.  My Ramen was good but not great.  The noodles were really good.  The broth warmed us up and was good but I felt it needed a little more salt or something to bring out more the flavors in my Ramen.  I'd give it a six out of ten.  I like the vegetable in my Ramen but the chicken looked a little funny to me and tasted funny too.  The Ramen filled me up and I was satisfied.  Not the best Ramen and maybe a little over priced but if your in the area and it's cold out this is a good spot to try out."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, but it all really fell short. I started with the cucumber and cauliflower appetizers. The cucumber tasted just like pickles and didn't have the right kick to it. The cauliflower was one huge breaded cauliflower. The peanut sauce on the bottom was lacking and it was very difficult to cut up with just chopsticks. I got the shio ramen, which had some tasty ingredients (crispy pig ears, ramen egg), but the broth was very bland and the pork belly was not great.  The specialty drinks could use some work - tried the fig cocktail and rose/vodka drink and both didn't wow me.  I will give it another try in a few weeks, and hopefully the food will improve."}
{"text":"Third time here and best time yet.

Ordered the Inferno. Perfectly seasoned, just spicy enough, and fantastic mix of textures (crispy chicken, firm-white-gooey-yolk boiled egg, perfectly cooked noodles). I know ramen broth is sorta considered unhealthy, but I couldn't stop myself from drinking every last drop.

Beer selection is highly curated; it's not a large selection (maybe 10 different choices), but they're all fantastic. Dogfish Head sour I got was one of the best I've had.

First visit was fantastic. Second visit, I found my ramen to be a little lacking in seasoning, and I had to add quite a bit of the MSG and ramen pepper provided on the table to bring the Unami factor up. This one was done perfectly and I didn't add a drop of anything to it.

It's a small selection compared to a couple of the other ramen shops in town, but what they have, they execute well. Hope they stick around for the long haul."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on Saturday around dinner time and was pleasantly surprised to be seated immediately. It looked like they had ample seating in the whole place, so that was a plus! 

We ordered the veggie bao bun (which they change on a weekly basis...I think..if not daily) and they actually brought out the meat bao instead. Even though the order was wrong, the meat bao was still good! 

I had the inferno ramen which was juuuust enough spice to not leave the place with steam coming from my mouth and ears. I would say spice level sits at about a 5 or 6 out of 10 on that dish. All in all I would return and try other things. I think the food and overall ambiance and location is great!"}
{"text":"I agree with several other reviews here. I was really excited to try this place and after I had I was just left with a \"meh\" feeling. I don't know if it's because I have had amazing ramen elsewhere and I wanted this place to live up to the expectations I had left those places with? The ramen was just \"ok\". Ramen bar is squirrel hill is slightly better but also slightly pricier (& to me inconsistent). Unfortunately, If you're looking for flavorful broth, you won't find it here. I find that a good broth, I can eat without  having the urge to add things they provide on the tables to it (sauces, spices, ect). This broth was missing something and I couldn't put my finger on it. I know when opening a new restaurant, it can sometimes take a little time to walk before you can run. So we will give it a few months before we come back and give it a second shot."}
{"text":"Disappointing. My partner and I eat out a lot and don't hesitate to order anything and everything we want on the menu. I had Ki Ramen at their pop up before their location opened and thought it was good. My meal here left much to be desired. The curry ramen was bland (even with chili paste) and I thought the food was overpriced. $15 for a vegetarian noodle bowl seems a bit much. The snacks were marginally more exciting, we ordered the chicken skin and cauliflower which were fine but not great. All around I was unimpressed, and the service was terribly mediocre. Our server came over TOO often to ask random questions when it was obvious that we were deep in conversation.  We were rushed out even though it was 9 pm on Wednesday night and there were available tables all around us.  I felt that Ki Ramen's food was trying to be like Grit & Grace's menu (I miss Grit & Grace!)... but was no where near as good.   If I eat here again, it will not have been my suggestion."}
{"text":"This ramen was the worst I've ever had and it was probably the most expensive! It was very bland, no flavor at all and hardly anything else in the ramen! I had really bad acid burps the rest of the evening afterwards. Ugh!"}
{"text":"We had the pork and veggie bao buns and the shoyu chicken ramen and flaming beef brisket ramen with a butter bomb. The broth was rich and the meats were very good. Surprised to see this place only has 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I was very excited to hear that Ki Ramen was opening!  Ever since I've gotten back from Japan, I've been craving authentic Japanese ramen, and of all the shops I've been to in town, Ki Ramen has come the closest to what I enjoyed in Tokyo.  The broth was rich and the service was quick.  Our appetizer of crunchy roasted curried cauliflower was delicious--it would be worth going back for by itself!  

I prefer the ramen here to the Ramen Bar in Squirrel Hill or Yuzu Kitchen in downtown."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a rainy day for a steaming bowl of noodle soup. Unfortunately the temperature was lukewarm at best. Overall a very mediocre but passable ramen shop. The one nice thing is that they don't cook with MSG and leave it on the side for you to add at your discretion. 

Shoyou ramen - very greasy. I'm not sure if the broth itself was already greasy or if it was just soaking off of the fried chicken. Noodles were on the hard and chewy side and they were kind of clumped together at the bottom. Chicken tasted okay. 

Inferno ramen - also a layer of grease covering the soup. Brisket was made well and was very flavorful. The spice level really is pretty mild. Again, noodle texture isn't what I'm used to. 

Overall flavor 3/5, but the egg was cooked well. The grease on top doesn't leave you feeling the best after eating it. Would try another flavor, but definitely wouldn't be a go to place in the area."}
{"text":"When you walk in a restaurant, the aroma of a kitchen should be inviting.  Not the case at Ki Ramen.  I believe it was the Kim Chi that made the front of the house have a foul odor, but whatever it was made for a bad start to the dinner.

We still ordered the Kim Chi; it's been a while since I last ordered it from a pretty authentic Korean restaurant in town and was having a craving for it.  This tasted nothing like I remembered.  As I mentioned previously, the smell was pretty bad and that made it hard to enjoy.  Plus it was overly spiced and didn't seem to have much cabbage.

The ramen bowl was okay, I got the SHOYU RAMEN but subbed out the chicken for brisket.  Brisket was good and tender with very generous amounts in the bowl.  Still a bit pricey at $12.  Service was very good but can't say I enjoyed the gangster rap music soundtrack while eating.  

Overall, wouldn't rush back.  I would stick to the ramen only, avoid the kim chi, and try not to notice the foul odor that permeates the house."}
{"text":"I ordered shoyu ramen and overall it's good. The soup tastes great but one thing I don't like is the noodle. I can actually still taste the flour in the noodle. I also ordered the pig ear. The texture of pig ear is not like that of I have ever tried in other places. It's special and I think it worths a try."}
{"text":"Finally - outstanding ramen in Pittsburgh. My fiancé and I went on Thursday evening for dinner. Although it was the soft opening with a limited menu, the dishes were outstanding.

We started with the fried cauliflower - cauliflower was not greasy, crunchy yet delicate, and topped with an assortment of sauces and bonito flakes.

The highlight - the vegetarian curry ramen. The broth was legitimately slurp-able. Delicate yet satisfying, the lemongrass and coconut broth was outstanding. The chicken ramen was also quite good - and the chicken was perfectly cooked.

Not a fan of ramen eggs? I'm definitely not, so was about to forego the egg on top of the chicken ramen.  Im very happy that I didn't make that mistake - the egg was outstanding. It was more of a delicately sous vide egg - which was satisfying and enjoyable.


Along with the usual togarashi, you can top your ramen with MSG (no joke) and a homemade combination of ground pepper - which I encourage you to try."}
{"text":"I've made three trips to Ki Ramen at this point and have thoroughly enjoyed every one. Before my first trip here the only ramen experience I had was the 28¢ packs from the grocery store, so I was really excited to try some real ramen, and I was not disappointed. Ki has a hip atmosphere, and it's pretty loud inside. Service was great all 3 times (one time was takeout but the person at the front station was super friendly and chatty while I waited for my food). The most memorable bowl has been the miso bowl, to which I added crispy pig ears, edamame, and bean sprouts. Flavors melded well, everything was fresh and delicious. Bowl with additions was $17 before tip so definitely a splurge meal. When I ordered takeout, the broth was packaged separately from the rest so that stuff didn't get soggy and that was great; it was just as good after a 20 minute drive as it was fresh in house. The bao buns were a great appetizer as well."}
{"text":"I really like the ambience and vibe in this restaurant. I got the shoyu ramen and it was okay - the broth, noodles and chicken was kind of bland and I didn't really like the onsen egg (it was too soft). My friends got inferno and said the braised brisket was good but other than that it was just spicy. I also got a meat bao, that was decent - not worth the six dollars though. Overall this restaurant was ok, nothing too special."}
{"text":"I've had their ramen at one of their pop ups and it was excellent. At the soft opening, I had the chicken ramen and it was good. The chicken was super tender, the broth was packed full of flavor and the serving was perfect. I will return to try more from the menu."}
{"text":"Ki Ramen is awesome. I can't say enough about their ramen bowels. 
And my almost 3 year old is obsessed with \"stop to eat the big soup bowl of noodles\" place. Or just saying hello and waving to their diners at the open bar window down stairs who are slurping and/or cheering for them for their good taste in food. Or waving through the glass on Butler Street at the diners inside. My three year old is a character. He really loves soup. And people who choose to eat soup. We love Ki Ramen. 

Personally, I love the ramen bowl customized w a butter bomb, some extra chicken, and my egg held. Ki Ramen like all good Ramen places has you season your own bowl. Seasoning is on the table. It's the diners choice to decide how bland or spicy they prefer their experience. I love a good Ramen place that knows how to follow tradition. 

I am also OBSESSED with their buns. My only \"complaint\" is that their isn't multiple flavors of bins daily or that their best buns aren't on the menu each day. They're awesome. If I had a better idea what was expected, I'd plan around the bun to choose when to eat at Ki Ramen. As someone who eats very little meat, and mostly just chicken a couple times a month not knowing the Bun schedule makes choosing Ki Ramen buns for a meal difficult.  


BUT- I only mentioned it because those little buns filled with goodies are so delicious and I just crave them all the time. I can't get enough!"}
