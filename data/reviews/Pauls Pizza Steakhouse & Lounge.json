{"text":"Some friends and I ate in this evening (Saturday). I ordered the beef dip, and asked them to add mozza. They did, but would have been nice if it had been melted. Still, it was good, and my onion rings were delicious. My friends all ordered chicken cordon blue, and were all very impressed. A couple of them had soup to start and loved it. I tried the spinach dip and pita chips, and LOVED that, just wish they provided enough chips for all that dip. We decided to try cheesecake for dessert, and that's where things took a decided turn for the worse. I never thought I would find a cheesecake I didn't like, but Paul's has it. But if you enjoy your cheesecake store-bought, frozen, and thawed, with fruit that has been frozen, then thawed, then be sure to get it here. The friends who ordered that couldn't even eat it, and I couldn't finish the key lime cheesecake I ordered either. It wouldn't have been good anyway, but they decide to drown what little lime flavor it had in chocolate sauce. The very first cheesecake I ever tried making myself was hands down 20x better than what I paid for tonight."}
{"text":"Think old school, small town pizza and steak place. Who doesn't love that vibe?!   We have ordered pizza from Paul's for the five years we have been living in Airdrie and always for delivery. The pizza shows up in the time they quote you at the time you order (it can be as quick as 30 minutes at a slow time and as long as 90 minutes when they are busy). The pizza always has generous toppings and shows up hot! Note: the pizza here is not skimpy, a medium can feed my Hubs and I with leftovers.   Now, they have made one small change. Our pizza used to show up a bit soggy on the bottom. This was to be expected with the sheer amount of volume, but now they have some sort of plastic disc laid under the pizza that prevents that. Wow! Our last pizza showed up with a crispy bottom crust!!   We have been dying to try other items from Paul's so we decided to go into eat on Friday night. We were a party of 3 and showed up at 5:30 and the place was packed! Wow, what a shock! We thought we were going early enough to avoid a wait. There were no tables in the restaurant and we got the last table in the lounge. Lucky us!   The food was great! We started with their featured shrimp appie and were not disappointed. My lasagna was fabulous and my MIL's steak was still cooked to her desired 'medium' although the steak was thin. I don't know why he did this (because like I mentioned, we wanted to try other things), but my Hubs ordered... the pizza. Guess he wanted to try it right out of the oven. And he did enjoy it and couldn't finish the small Paul's Special!   The prices are reasonable and fair. The service is always fantastic whether you are calling your order or dining in. Next time, I will make a reservation! (I didn't know they did this.)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in Alberta. Best value - delicious well balanced crust to cheese to toppings ratio. Paul's has been around in Airdrie for a long time - it's where the locals come to have consistent and delicious meals made from scratch.   Don't be deterred by the outdated decor... One bite of the souvlaki will transport you to the Mediterranean...one taste of the twice baked potato and you're envisioning the best thanksgiving dinner...a slice of the decadent pizza .... And you'll lose yourself period!   We will be regulars of Paul's for years to come."}
{"text":"Best pizza! Lots of toppings & cheese. Service awesome! Nice decor, very relaxing. Worth the drive from Calgary if you crave an awesome pizza!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here tonight! Hubby and I came after seeing them fully booked on Valentines day, I can see why! So good! We wanted to try a bit of everything so pizza, steak and pasta it was all great!"}
{"text":"Terrible meat flavors. And sauce is that sweet taste you get from baked lasagna pizza joints..  Tried it twice ...  First was pep and mushroom. ..meat was soured.  Second time was meat lovers...  Worst pie ever..and I am very sad about it .. the cheese is great . But the ingredients are terrible.  My pregnant wife is so sad..as she throws the meat off.. I wish I could scape away the off flavor ground beef."}
{"text":"Last night, I was with a group of people and we were looking to order something to feed all of us. I asked my friends for recommendations, being from Calgary, and  Paul's was one of the places highly recommended. I was not really in the mood for pizza again, but my boyfriend told me Paul's was awesome and I decided to give it a shot.  I pulled up what I thought was the menu online. I guess in my extreme hunger I did not notice there is a \" Dinner menu\", as well as a \" Take-out menu\". Too bad :(  I had found a platter that I thought would be so awesome. For only $20, you get \" Battered Button Mushrooms, Beer Battered Shrimp,Paul's Garlic Dry Ribs, Paul's Hummus Delight,Vietnamese Spring Rolls, Zucchini Sticks\". Yum! We were all stoked to get that and a large pizza. There were four adults and two children, and that would have been the perfect amount to feed all of us for only $45 plus tax and delivery/gratuity.  I placed the call and was told by a young- sounding man ,\"Party platter??? I don't have that menu.....but..ok.......\"  So I ask, \" Ok, could you please make sure it is available, please? It is on the dinner menu, so I don't see why not?\" I am put on hold for maybe 15 seconds.  \" No it is not. I just talked to the \" boss boss\".  No apology or explanation as why it is not available. I ASSUME, being in the restaurant business myself for around 20 years, that it is either due to it not \" travelling well\" ( such as steaks, certain sauces, ice cream, etc), or not having proper containers to transport it in. You would think that a bunch of appetizers that are all on the take-out  menu separately would be ok ???  A simple\" I am sorry, but the platter is a dine- in special\" would have been nice, but  I was not given any reason, just told they don't deliver that. That's fine, I can find something else, I guess. I told the guy that I would call back in a few minutes after I knew what we wanted.  After reading the menu and being super disappointed that I wasn't getting the platter, I finally decided to suck it up and just get a pizza and a side of the Hummus . I called back. It was a girl who answered the phone this time, and she was a little bit rude.  \" I would like to make an order for delivery please.\"  \" Are you sure?\" ( RUDE!!!!!!!  Am I sure?? Are you kidding me? WTH?)   \" Yes........???\"   \" Oh well is this **** *********??\"  \" Yes.\"   Sigh, \" K what can I get for you ?\"  I order a large chef's special and a Paul's special Hummus.   \" Is that a large as well?\" ( I think she was thinking that was a pizza as well? I had to clarify that I wanted the hummus appetizer.)  She wasn't super rude, but the \" Are you sure??\" question was pretty darn rude and she definitely wasn't overly friendly.Definitely not the kind of person  I would want answering my phone if I had a restaurant, but maybe she was having a bad day or something?? After having an employee who was either new or improperly trained, and then dealing with a somewhat rude girl, I  did not know what to expect with the rest of the service or the food.  THANK GOODNESS the delivery came when it was supposed to, the driver was friendly and the food was delicious. I would have given it a 4 to 4.5/5 had I not dealt with the semi-rude girl and the first guy who seemed not to be in the know.  I will probably order from here again, as the food IS delicious , but I hope to deal with someone in a little bit better of a mood next time."}
{"text":"First and foremost, there is no other place in Airdrie to go for pizza!!!  You can never go wrong with the food, no matter what you order, it is consistently wonderful.  I usually eat in the restaurant, but I can also say that on the many times we have had home delivery things are also usually perfect.  On two occasions, we were delivered the wrong pizza (we are all human, things happen...), and within 15 minutes we were delivered a hot and fresh replacement, and told to just keep the wrong one.  Point being, they take great pride in making things right on the very few occasions a mistake is made.  My only issue with eating in was on a recent visit.  The restaurant was packed, and my friend and I sat in the lounge.  The service was ok, but it could have been better.  Servers were very insistent on only servicing their own tables, serving their table next to yours and willfully avoiding eye contact with you as you held out your empty glass, and I was really bothered by the fact that my empty beverage glass not only sat on the edge of the table for more than 15 minutes when we saw BOTH lounge servers put on their coats and go outside to smoke outside the window where we ate.  At that point, there was no staff member covering the lounge.  It would have been cool if we weren't utterly parched for a second drink for so long before they left.  I worked service industry for 13 years, and the friend I was bringing for the first time still works service industry and has for almost 20 years.  You never go out to smoke when there is work to be done, and when your paying patrons are thirsty (We were purchasing cocktails and beer, not pop refills...).  Service 101.  If it wasn't for the inconsistent service, Paul's would get a solid 5 stars from me.  But even with the service issues I had (and believe me, having worked in the industry as long as I did, I have a far more forgiving view on service...) the food is so good I can't take my rating lower unless the server threw my food on the floor in front of me.  Because it is just that tasty, I would likely still try and eat the salvageable parts of the meal...."}
{"text":"Use to come to Pauls for years when we lived in Airdrie. Stopped in tonight as I travelling to Calgary on business and it was awful. We waited for a while for service (not that big of a deal) we ordered and got out pizza \"COLD And burnt cheese\" soooo disappointed. The evening manager did try to make it up to us but by then we lost our appetite."}
{"text":"D and I were craving a steak dinner the other night, so we did some searching to see what Airdrie has to offer with decent reviews.  We thought we'd give this place a try and it's a touch old fashioned but they kept their food tasty.  We started out sharing a zucchini sticks plate.  The zucchini itself was fresh, not too juicy so they didn't drip everywhere like you get with White Spot back in BC, and the batter was crisp and well seasoned.  The tzatziki dip was really good on its own, high quality thick dip with lots of cucumber bits, but it was not the right dip for zucchini.  A fresh ranch would have been a better complimentary flavour for the zucchini and batter seasoning.  For the main course we each had an 8oz New York with a soup to start for him and salad for me.  He had the Potato Bacon soup which was supposedly absolutely delicious, and my salad was a simple lettuce and tomato salad with thousand island dressing.  The dressing came in a little take-out cup which was strange and i felt bad using something that would just go in the garbage rather than being washable, but the dressing itself was great.  The steaks were cooked just right, medium rare so the thin cuts were still nicely pink in the middle.  The flavour was great with light seasoning and a rich buttery coating that was delicious.  The vegetables were perfectly steamed carrots and broccoli coated in hollandaise.  That was a pleasant surprise as we both love all three of those especially when put together.  For the final side I had the stuffed potato and he had the rice.  The rice was simple, with a few vegetables thrown in, and looked pretty good but I think I had the better side with the potato.  The stuffed potato was delicious with cheese, herbs and bacon bits in it.  The splatter of dried parsley around the outside of the plates is a bit dated and should probably be ditched as it's more messy than attractive now.  A clean edged plate would be nicer, and it doesn't add anything to the meal.  All in all the food was tasty and we while we're staying in Airdrie we will probably go back."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Can't beat the Paul's special. Thick pizza, lots of toppings and decent crust. Think Vern's pizza but not as greasy and a better crust. Even better the next day. Their Chicken Fettuccine Is really good. Lots of baked cheese and a great home made sauce."}
{"text":"Very good food  The place was sold 2015  Some changes to the menu I think all positive still the best thick pizza in Airdrie I think They are updating the interior looks nice  Prices are fair for the quality and amount of food"}
{"text":"Paul's Pizza is an Airdrie landmark. A tradition. Old faithful. Whenever we can't decide on dinner, we always default to Paul's. The menu had something on it for EVERYONE and their food has never been a let down. I love the Greek salad and their cheese pizza is so cheesy and delightful. Their soups are good and their Chef salad is a monster! It's so big and delicious. Their pastas are excellent, the tortellini is my favourite. The waitstaff are always great! You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Average neighborhood pub food. The veal parm was well seasoned and moist but the side spaghetti was lacking in taste.  The Paul's special pizza is deep dish and full of toppings but there was nothing special about it."}
{"text":"Work associate brought me by here for lunch. Got a all meat pizza and it was delicious! Got a small which was more then enough to fill me up. Super thick toppings! Service was fast and prompt as well."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place to eat if we are on our way south to Calgary. Food was great. Everyone in family of four loved it. Friendly staff. Good simple food and kids decided that was the best pizza ever. Definitely on our return list."}
{"text":"Great place, with good food & great staff.  Not upscale, but if you want a good wholesome Meal or good pizza, this is a great place."}
{"text":"Food Poisoning, Managers don't seem to Care, Wasn't my favourite experience...  When we moved to Airdrie we had heard a lot of hype about Pauls Pizza. We were told it was incredible and that we HAD to try it.  Naturally on our first night moving here we wanted to celebrate, so we ordered out a few take outs from Pauls Pizza.  The pizza arrived cold and soggy, and was rather expensive for what it was. Regardless we ate it, although it taste a little strange, the chicken seemed under cooked and rubbery.  My entire family experienced food poisoning the following day and were out of commission for about a week.  Can't say it was our favourite experience, and when we asked the owners for a refund they didn't seem to care and hung up on us.  Giving it 2 stars because of the experience, not sure we want to risk it again."}
{"text":"After running to Airdrie for dress alterations, my girlfriend, her sister and I were looking for a place for some dinner.  A co-worker of ours (Darlene) lives in Airdrie so we stopped to check out her new place and discussed where we should head for dinner.  She mentioned Paul's Pizza and Steakhouse along with other places but we decided to go with what she mentioned first.  It was about 6:30PM when we arrived at Paul's.  We went into the lounge area and my first impression was it reminded me kind of like the show Cheers...where locals meet to drink, relax, chat and have fun.  There were a couple of booths free, so we snagged one.  The waitress noticed us right away so she approached us and apologized right off the bat because she was the only server and there was a good amount of people to keep her fairly busy.  After waiting a bit, she gave us menus.  I found there was a good selection of lounge food, the typical wings, pizza, burgers, nachos steaks...  I decided to go with the full order Veal Cutlets with french fries, my girlfriend went with the steak sandwich with garden salad and balsamic, her sister went with the Chef's Special Sirloin and Darlene went with the steak sandwich with caesar salad.  The VC and Chef's Special Sirloin both came with soup or salad to start.  We both got the soup of the day which was mushroom.  When the soup arrived, it was...different.   When I think of mushroom soup, I think of it as white and this wasn't white but a beef broth color.  It was a bit salty but still good.  When the main courses arrived they looked great!  My VC was covered in gravy with a nice portion of fries and a side of vegetables with some nice sauce on them.  The VC was breaded, grilled and tasted pretty good!  The steak sandwiches looked like regular steak sandwiches.  I had a taste and the meat was juicy and tender.  Lastly, the Chef's Special Sirloin was topped with mushrooms and came with spaghetti and boy did that plate look full.  We figured it would be a small side of spaghetti but it covered half the plate! It looked sooo good.  All in all, we found our meals to be filling and deliicious.  Service was OK but we understand because she was the only server taking care of the whole lounge.    I like places like this that have that homey feeling with homemade recipes.  I will definitely return to try something else on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Omg just popped into this place for a steak dinner!! I left the next day to continue on to my travels from best Western. But I need to do a shout out to the chef that made my steak and my baked potato and vegetables. Whoever is cooking don't stop what you're doing you know exactly what you're doing. That was the best steak that I had in a very long time. Thank you Canada awesome steak!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is REALLY starting to annoy me!   When I first bought my house in Airdrie a few months ago we were renovating and ate take out a lot. Paul's quickly became our favourite. We ordered the club sandwich platter and the tortellini often, and thought both were quite delicious. (Their tzatziki sauce rocks!) We were placing these orders during the week.   Then came the weekend.   We ordered on a Friday night and the food we got was abysmal. The fries and onion rings were so cold and soggy they were inedible. The rest of our food was lukewarm and a mere shadow of what we were used to. It was so bad I called to complain. Needless to say I stopped ordering there for awhile.   This week my neighbour told me that Pauls updated their menu and added new items. They ordered on Wednesday and  tried the new poutine, fried pickles, (and other items) and were impressed!   So after a long day of work on Friday, my boyfriend and I decided to give it another try!   FAIL.   After waiting an hour for our food;  Both poutines were cold. Club sandwich was cold and soggy. The sauce that came with the pickles was weird, honey mustard mixed with something. They should've asked because their tzatziki probably would've been great. My French onion soup was in such a tiny container that there was almost no broth. It was a huge clump of cheese with soggy bread and gigantic onion slices that I doubt anyone would eat. I'm an onion lover and it grossed me out.   They are clearly too busy & overwhelmed on the weekends to produce anything worth eating. Most of our $45 order went in the trash. So disappointing. I cannot recommend this place to anyone simply because it's a gamble. You MIGHT get good food but don't count on it.   I won't be playing take-out roulette at Paul's again."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for dinner on our way back from Drumheller and polled the people coming out with takeout. All were positive and confirmed we had landed on the best restaurant in the area. We found it busy but only a short wait. The furniture is dated but comfortable. The service was excellent. The food was delicious and in large portions. We would come back again. Great Value."}
{"text":"Easily the best place to eat in Airdrie!  I have never tried their pizza, but I have been to this restaurant on several occasions.  I have had the pasta dishes (usually ravioli), veal parmigiana, and steak sandwich.  Always excellent.  The decor is a bit dated, but  I come there to eat, not to admire the drapes!  The place is always packed so the owners don't have much incentive to upgrade I guess.  All that's missing is a  kids menu, but you can get half orders so we make do.  Maybe  someday I will get around to trying the pizza, but everything else  is so good!"}
{"text":"Just save yourself the heartache and go elsewhere. Horrible out dated decor. The salads are water logged and come on plastic plates.  Feels very cafeteria like."}
