{"text":"very bad management I have ever seen. Placed the order on phone 1 hr before but still asked me to wait for more than 30 mnts in the restaurant to pickup 1 biryani. And on top of chicken is seems to be very hard. I would never go for it"}
{"text":"Been here for Friday lunch buffet. The spread was very minimal and the serving quantities were pretty small. Half the items were empty at a given time. No one to clean up the soiled plates from any of the tables. $12 for this buffet is way overpriced.
Please avoid and you have way better options around."}
{"text":"Excellent food, presentation, atmosphere, and service!! Love the lunch special (dine-in), new favorite Indian restaurant!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to eat here twice while in town for business. Both times, the dishes I ordered (paneer makhani and paneer lababdar) were amazingly flavorful. They were some of the best I've tasted. The staff was friendly and welcoming. I can't wait until my travels bring me back to Charlotte so I can taste more of their dishes."}
{"text":"I love this Indian Restaurant. It makes me think of when we went to India and stayed in the Taj Lake Palace. The food was excellent and the atmosphere, relaxed and enchanting. Since my husband is from India we have eaten in a lot of Indian restaurants but this is my favorite. If you are visiting Charlotte make sure to look up the Clove restaurant. It is worth the find."}
{"text":"Best Indian cuisine, Ordered Lamb Korma and I'll definitely be going back! The service was great and the atmosphere is very authentic."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today with a friend and our food was incredible! We both had Tiki Masala (one paneer, one chicken) and it was full of flavor and quite frankly,  the best I've ever had.  The naan was delicious and the service was excellent.  The decor is inviting and beautiful.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Just wonderful food I had the goat In Clove style Curry. My companion had lamb saag ... both were delicious. The kulfi for desert had three choices we both had the mango which was delicious. Did not need the maraschino cherry on top though. Service was excellent. It is in a shooting big mall type spot on the second floor so easy to miss. I really was so surprised by the food quality"}
{"text":"Our family has been looking for an Indian restaurant similar in quality to Blue Taj in Ballantyne since we north moved to Huntersville. We've finally found it. CLOVE was an outstanding experience: spacious, beautifully decorated dining room, wonderfully gracious staff, perfectly presented delicious food, large portions and extremely reasonable prices. Don't forget to try their homemade ice cream.
It's a place that's easy to overlook in its upstairs location, but it's 100% worth the elevator trip for a visit. 
Highly recommended. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Bottom line: No. I didn't enjoy the food, slow service and there's simply better options in charlotte to grab some good Indian food. 

Service: our waitress was this really sweet lady, she seemed fairly new but tried her best and we appreciated her kindness. The actual food service was slow, we were the ONLY people in the restaurant for lunch and it still took 30-45 mins to get our food. They also did not bring the dishes out at the same time, with some of us waiting almost 20 minutes after the first wave of food was brought out to get our food. 


Food: we ordered about 4-5 side dishes, orders of naan and samosa to share among 5. 
-Samosa was good
-Naan was not good to me, seems thin and had a weird sour taste 
-I didn't like the side dish I ordered (paneer shahi), I tried a few of the other side dishes ordered which tasted okay. 
-all in all I was not impressed with the food, it wasn't bad, just wasn't something i particularly enjoyed 

Price: expensive. Side dishes range from 10-14 and comes with rice. If you want naan or appetizers that's also extra. If you're going two people and you each get a side dish and naan expect your bill to be upwards of 30$."}
{"text":"It was a very good experience!! Our orders were all equally delicious and the best match for our taste buds."}
{"text":"Grabbed some take out today from Clove. Walked in to a very modern, but inviting and cozy restaurant. Sat at the bar for a short time waiting for my order. I noticed that the restaurant was super clean and the bar was stocked with beer and wine. Too bad I was on call! I chatted with the friendly guy behind the bar about this and that. My Tikka Masala came out piping hot! I got it back to the hospital and all of my coworkers were so jealous! It was way better than any Tikka Masala I've had in South Charlotte. The portion was huge (enough to take leftovers to my husband for his dinner), it was reasonably priced, and most importantly, it was delicious. Perfectly spicy! I want to try other things on the menu, but that Tikka was the bomb! I will be making special trips from Ballantyne to eat here again!"}
{"text":"I would say it was an amazing food with a right amount of spices where you would experience every bit of it. I have ordered ulavacharu paneer dum biryani and bagara baigan the other day and it was fantastic. I would recommend this restaurant to all food lovers and i bet you all would add this to your weekend restaurant list."}
{"text":"Got Postmates from here yesterday and it was excellent! Gobi was appropriately spicy and very filling for an app. Chittinadu was also really good and so flavorful. Garlic naan was nice and garlic-y and fresh! Will definitely be ordering again. Oh and it all came super hot which is unheard of for Postmates."}
{"text":"I am new to Charlottesville but not new to Indian food. I LOVE this restaurant.  The flavors of my favorite dishes are spot on! The prices are awesome!  And this Guy! He is great! The most pleasant people."}
{"text":"Best Indian food we have ever had. Our family tried 6 different dishes and loved each one of them. The service was also excellent! We can't wait to return."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian meals I've had. I had the Baingan ka Bartha with Chili Naan, which was pretty spicy so be warned! Delicious, though. My friend had the chicken tikka masala with garlic naan and loved it. Lovely atmosphere as well. Thanks, Clove!"}
{"text":"Decor is beautiful.Food is sub par. Service is poor. Waiter is not attentive, Did not offer drinks and we had to approach the bar to request takeout boxes and the bill."}
{"text":"Wow!
We love Indian and happened to see it while we were visiting our son in Charlotte. The naan is better than any naan I've had before- light and flavorful. The egg drop soup served as a starter for the express lunch was unexpectedly good. Full flavor. Then the main dishes - khorma and clove curry - were rich and flavorful. The express lunch also came with daal and an Indian pudding with fruit that topped off the meal perfectly. All for $10. Yum

We also happened to have kulfi (ice cream) as well, and the pistachio is amazing."}
{"text":"I ordered biryani and fruit custard and I was delivered ice cream instead of custard. Biryani did not come with raita or side curry which is usually expected and it tasted bland."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious the food was! Even my husband (who doesn't like indian cuisine that much) really loved this place. We will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This would rank amongst the best Indian food I have had in charlotte.. the ambience , food , service everything was spot on. Had veg Malabar curry and chicken Chettinadu with garlic and peshwari naan.."}
{"text":"First off, beautiful restaurant! I would come back just to dine inside and relax.  I was in the mood for bread and it had been a while since I ordered Indian food.  I'm in search for good chicken korma and saw a new restaurant listed.  The photos caught my eye and sought out the yellow curry.  I did my order on Grubhub and waited near for my order.  A patron just picked up here order as I was about to go inside.  I had hoped it wasn't busy on Father's Day and indeed not busy at all as I was the only patron at the time.  Two families came as I was leaving.  Perfect spot to cool off as you wait in your order.  It took about 10 more minutes to compete but this place is awesome inside with plenty of space, seating, bar, and leather sofa.  The menu had a lot of non-typical items I've never heard of so that's a plus.  I took home chicken korma, vegetable somoas, garlic naan, and shahi kuda (bread pudding/french toast).  I read reviews beforehand.  The spice level was mild by default.  The spice level wasn't a choice unless you specified it yourself in the text box.  The korma was oily but had a good taste, REAL tender chicken (not the cubed stuff).  The sauce turned dark.  I found 4 cardamom seeds and pieces of cashew as i ate.  The samosas were prefect and I got the three sauces I requested.  The Shahi bread pudding was good although fried but I can imagine it tasting even better whiling dining in.  The naan was good but I would have expected two naan like most places.  I will probably return for try more."}
{"text":"Food and service was very good. Highly recommend it! I got the vegetable curry and it was delicious. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Formerly known as Peacock Indian Cuisine, Clove is quietly tucked away  on the second floor of the Grande Promenade in University. 
When you first walk in, you're greeted with dim lighting and colorful hanging wall tapestries. The calming music paired with the multiple indoor water fountains made for a calming, tranquil atmosphere which transports you away from the daily grind of life.
My partner and I stopped in for the first time for their lunch special (dine-in only) and both ordered the vegetable tikka masala ($9) and vegetable samosas ($5) as an appetizer. 
Saji, our waiter, was very polite, unobtrusive, and attentive throughout our meal.
When our samosas came out, we delighted in the beautiful serving dishes made out of a heavy silver and intricate designs. Our samosas were piping hot, and the sauces that came with it were equally delicious.
After giving up meat, I always love when restaurants provide vegetarian options aside from their meat options, and Clove did not disappoint. Their veg tikka masala was soooo yummy - still providing that saucy, creamy, spicy goodness that any chicken tikka might. Their side dishes that accompanied - a corn soup, naan, basmati rice, and another side I forget the name of - all were included in the $9 lunch special! Needless to say we had plenty of leftovers.
Overall this has easily become my favorite Indian restaurant in University, we plan on going back often for lunch!
My only tip to the restaurant would be to put more \"Open\" signs up, because from certain angles looking up, the restaurant appears to be closed from the outside."}
{"text":"Update- this is my second visit to the place. I was here when they opened the place new and loved the food. Unfortunately this time the service has turned bad and the food served is tasteless with undercooked naans and sour tasting fried rice. Somebody needs to tell the management, the decor alone wouldn't  make folks want to return. Save yourself a horrible time, loss of Money and bad taste."}
{"text":"Went for my first time for lunch, this is a really beautiful restaurant inside, the presentation is wonderful. On top of all that the food is absolutely amazing, very rich and spicy and way better than your typical Indian greasy spoon joint. Highly recommended and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I LOVED the flavors of the chicken tikka and the garlic naan was fresh and hot! The ambience is nice as well"}
{"text":"There are no negative stars to rate this restaurant. The experience was that bad. Went here on a friday night for dinner 1 hour before closing. There probably were 2 tables occupied with 2-3 guests at each and 1 takeout order waiting. We ordered Rava dosa and chilli bajji from the menu. Had to wait around 35 minutes for the bajji to come out which was good. The Rava dosa came 10mins after the chilli bajji and was horrific. The dosa was sour. I am from south india and have never seen a Rava dosa being sour in my life. It also did not taste anything like a Rava dosa. The kitchen probably improvised on the old dosa batter they already had and prepared an abomination they call the Rava dosa and served it to us. The chutney was another disaster. It was stale and sour. Why even in include items on the menu that they cannot understand or make ? 

When we brought it up with one of the staff we were given the same old atory of its made fresh and other BS. I am a south indian and have no issues identifying whats wrong with my food. The dosa that they served us wasn't edible by any human being. 

I paid for the chilli bajji we already ate and left the place. Even if i neglect the wait time because they were short staffed, there is no excuse for serving food thats not edible.

Never ever will we step into this restaurant again. They have no respect towards food nor the customers."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely beautiful!  Everything is so nice from the plates to the glasses.  It's truly a great Indian cuisine!  They have a fantastic wine list with great prices!  Their customer service is phenomenal, I don't think I have ever experienced customer service as great as I did here!  They really make you feel enjoyed and that you're a very important guest.  Moving to the food... WOW!!! This is the most authentic and delicious Indian food I have ever had! With every bite, my smile grew!  I had the lamb and vegetarian samosas.  AMAZING!!!   I also had the mango ice cream and the pistachio ice cream, and wow they were so delicious.  The presentation of all the food was amazing as well.  I highly recommend this place.  I got to speak with the owner and he explained to me that everything is made in the house and never frozen which is awesome and you honestly do not hear that very often.  I can't wait to go back and explore more of the menu!!"}
{"text":"Just had the lunch buffet and the food is fantastic!  Very flavorful and large number of choices.  Many vegetarian options too.  Great service too, Team was very attentive and kind.  I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I had to try this restaurant since it was nearby my work location and i looove hyderabadi food specially biryani. I tried dum biryani and wanted it spicy. It wasnt as spicy as I expected but wasnt bad too. Fresh rice and chicken with good raita. The boss was friendly and good ambience .."}
{"text":"Much nicer inside than I was expecting-very relaxing atmosphere.  I had the Clove curry with lamb which was excellent."}
{"text":"New Indian restaurant in Charlotte. Food is really good and tasty. Tried Reshmi kabab and Goat Biriyani. Both were good. Ambience and presentation is nice and unique. Also was served complimentary Kulfi which was delicious ! Only thing that has to improve is speed of Service. Order took a long time to arrive."}
{"text":"The food was exceptional and the service was great too. We ordered garlic naan and chicken Tikka masala and goat khorma. All of them were really authentic. Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Haven't tasted their main courses yet. But I'm already stunned by the quality and taste of their appetizers. We ordered chicken 65, chicken 99 and chicken lollipop and trust me, each dish was made to perfection. I am a spice lover and I had asked them specifically to make all 3 dishes a little more spicy than medium. And it was exactly as I expected. For now, this is the place to go to for non veg appetizers. 

Will soon post my review on the main courses!! How can I not try those after getting the taste?"}
