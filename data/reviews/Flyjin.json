{"text":"All around home run
The food is was on point and there is something for everyone.  (Plenty of se food, fish, meet and vegetarian options...)
It is a very trendy spot with beautiful people (staff and clients)
And the place actually turns in to a full on nights club after 11:30 pm.
So if you wanna do a great restaurant and go clubbing this is the best one stop shop in town.
BTW it is harder to get in if you Werner there for dinner..."}
{"text":"Clubbing, not dinner experience. 

Went with some well dressed friends to join a birthday happening inside. Was denied entry because we \"didn't bring any girls\", and refused to look at guest list to find the party and let us in."}
{"text":"Would I recommend Flyjin to all of my readers? Absolutely! If you are like me and enjoy Japanese fusion cuisine, special cocktails and/or simply wine, the Old Montreal and its trendy crowd, you would have to consider Flyjin at least once in your life.

{"text":"Flyjin saved the night! When our previous dinner plans for our bachelorette party fell through, the manager was able to sit all 8
of us together at the bar. The food and drinks were spectacular and Timothy was the best bartender. We had an excellent time. Definitely would come again."}
{"text":"Flyjin is a joke. Some friends and I wanted to grab a few drinks at the bar and the manager said that the only way we'd get in was to buy 3 bottles (we were 3 guys and 1 girl). Meanwhile, people were walking out of the bar complaining how dead it was inside. Shit service, thank you for not wasting my time."}
{"text":"The most detailed & delicious cocktails I've ever had!

My Girlfriends & I were visiting from Toronto & were told to try Flyjin! 

1. The entrance is a wooden door leading down some stairs, very mysterious and cool! 

2. We were greeted by an unfriendly hostess who may have been incapable of smiling. 

3. We were sat at the most uncomfortable seating in the restaurant. High stools, which I don't enjoy in any restaurant. 

4. Our waiter was a lovely gentleman who gave us plenty of recommendations. 

5. The food was unimpressive & overpriced. I've had my fair share of Japanese cuisine & these dishes were not on point. 

6. The cheesecake we ordered was one of the best I've ever had. 

7. We moved to the bar after dinner & that is when the magic happened. 

8. The cocktails we ordered were absolutely stunning! The details were incredible! 

9. The two gentlemen bartenders that served us were so friendly & humble. You could tell they took pride in their work! 

I'd skip the overpriced bland dinner & head right to the bar!"}
{"text":"One of the few japanese places where you enjoy good food while listening to good music.
The decor is red lights with gold fixtures, you have 2 bars from each side of the place. 
We set on the large one on the left. We where very well served and entertained by Van the bartender. 
We ordered Sacre printemps, it comes in a very nice porcelain cup. 

From Mr park cuisine (the chef behind the menu), you can expect the best. 
We had a salmon tartare. The taste is even better that the one I tasted last year. Its one of my favorite tartar in Montreal. We also had the salmon maki. A must try. 
As a main dish, I ordered the salmon tataki that comes with a tiny salad very crunchy , noodles and a mix of tiny cut vegetables. 
We also had the filet mignon, it s a very good version, not ur usual filet mignon. They also have some pork dumpling to try. 
We ordered several platters and all were exotic. 

I also went there during winter time and I can say that it is the perfect culinary gateway!

Expect the place to be pricy but you will definitly have a good time."}
{"text":"The guy at the door told me that they only allow people with bottle service. They wouldn't allow me even though I told him I was from outta town.
 I looked at the crowd, and most of them look like they can't even afford a couple drinks"}
{"text":"Pour la deuxième fois, moi et mes copines voulons sortir à cet endroit mais sans succès. On nous oblige à prendre un ''bottle service'' pour avoir le droit de rentrée .... REALLY!!? Soyons honnête on va quand même pas acheter un 40oz à trois! De plus, c'est pathétique de voir  le jeune homme à l'entrée laisse passer des personnes derrière nous qui venaient tout juste de mentionner au doorman n'avoir aucune guess liste. Belle logique !"}
{"text":"Walking down Saint-Pierre and scoping out the entrance to Flyjin - a dimly-lit tunnel covered on all sides by gold foil with black designs painted on - I was really excited. Very cool, underground vibe - literally. The restaurant/bar/dance floor is underground.

I wanted to like this place. The hostess was polite and efficient. The ambiance is great - lots of space, live DJ, subdued lighting, comfortable seating. Sadly, the food and some of the service leaves something to be desired. 

While one waiter was perfectly proficient in keeping everyone's water topped up, our main waitress was unimpressive. Had to flag her down because she wasn't making eye contact, rarely was she smiling, and I was (unpleasantly) surprised that - despite her walking back and forth around our table - she never asked anyone how they liked their order.

Maybe that's because the food & cocktails weren't likeable. At least the oysters were fine and well-presented. They're a great deal on Wednesdays, otherwise I wouldn't even bother. However, my Zen Buddha cocktail was mainly ice, heavy on the mint, and I couldn't even taste the cucumber. Based on the complaints about the bland and uninspired food from just about everyone at the table, and my disappointment with the cocktail, I didn't order anything else. 

Bottom line - doubt I'll be going out of my way for Flyjin, except if I'm in the area with friends and other Yelpers, and if so, it'll probably just be for their dancefloor. But I'm wary of their cocktails and pricey menu that doesn't seem to deliver."}
{"text":"My friends and I had the best time at Flyjn during my bachelor party weekend.  A huge thank you to the host and Raven our bottle service waitress for making it a really fun night.  With a group of seven hungry dudes we got to try most of the items on the menu.  The whole meal was amazing but the black cod was something special.  After finishing din we got hooked up with a great booth and were treated really well.  The staff wasn't pushy and were just helpful in just making sure we were having a good time.  Really cool vibe, attractive crowd, and a good mix of music.  Especially liked the move to some classic hip hop tunes later in the night. The fact that they brought out the daft punk helmet to where after my pal ordered us a few bottles of champagne was definitely a highlight of the night and weekend.  Cheers Flyjin!.... can't wait to come back and do it all again."}
{"text":"Amazing Japanese style food. Had the black code which was out of this world. All was great. Atmosphere was fabulous. Sashimi of salmon and salmon tartar appetizers are amazing. Had the gold saki bottle to go with meal."}
{"text":"For \"mtl a table\" with three course meal on a Wednesday night @ 8.
Place was nice. 
Girls n guys were nice n very good service right at the moment u get walked in. 
Drinks were good @ 12$ cocktails. 
Wednesday is oyster special @ 1$ each. Comes in dozens only. 
Food tasted good. 
There's a person providing refreshments (gum,  etc. Dunno what the name for them) if needed. 

Service was great n very responsive n tentative. 

Only bad thing was... Depending where u sit u may not get phone data reception... I got one bar reception. 

Left at 10pm so the place didn't turn over to a bar yet."}
{"text":"Had an incredible seafood dinner with visiting friends from Chile, all were very impressed with the quality and presentation of the food and the service and staff were flawless. We stayed until the place became a club and had a blast. One of the most fun nights out to be had in the city."}
{"text":"A couple of friends and myself went there last Thursday night. Again, as everybody is mentioning, you have to know where it is as you never walked in accidentally. Happy hour wasn't packed but you still need a reservation to get in. Food was great, and we particularly enjoyed the fried dumplings. Not a big sake fan but we had a chilled served one and it was ok.

I'll definitely get to this place again in the near future."}
{"text":"Don't ever come here.... six of us spend a thousand dollars on dinner and get told we have to move because the table is already reserved later. They kick us off the table and it sits empty for the next hour."}
{"text":"Petit frère du resto Flyjin, version café. 
On y sert bien évidemment du café (espresso, latté, etc.), des sodas, du thé glacé maison et du jus d'orange fraîchement pressé. Le café Flyjin vend aussi les beignets Trou de beige, qui sont absolument délicieux, quoi qu'un peu chers (comptez environ 4,25 pour un beigne). 

Le service est sympathique et assez rapide. Le local est petit, mais vraiment beau! 

Pourquoi seulement trois étoiles? Pour les prix assez élevés (quoi que semblable à ceux des autres cafés du Vieux Montréal), l'indisponibilité des produits (plus de soda maison, plus de glace un mardi midi) et le fait qu'au début, l'employé était complètement dans la lune et qu'il n'écoutait pas du tout ce que je lui disais, ce qui a rendu le début de ma visite un peu pénible. J'aurais aussi aimé qu'ils offrent un peu plus de choix de \" snacks \" (à part les beignets, il n'y avait qu'un ou deux croissants). 

Malgré tout, le café est excellent."}
{"text":"The food here is incredible. Their style of asian fusion is executed perfectly by Montreal renowned chef Antonio Park. I highly recommend the dumplings & sushi. If you want to stay for the nightclub, just book a late reservation and enjoy the night! 

I would normally rate 5 stars for this quality of food but I have to admit that the bottle/table prices for the nightclub are pretty high for Montreal standards (minimum 1500$ spend for a standing table of 10)."}
{"text":"I went here for a bachelor party dinner. I was a little weary after reading some reviews but I had a great time. It started off well when I arrived in the first cab of our group at 9:30 the hostess was very friendly. While we were waiting for the rest of the group to arrive the manager came up with a tray of shots meant for a party that had just departed so we got them. They were a great mix of vodka and yuzu. A guy having a smoke chimed in saying that was what he drinks and if we want it later as a cocktail ask for what the DJ drinks and introduced himself as Avi.

The food and cocktails were all excellent especially the black cod. The music Avi was spinning was awesome. I found a mix on soundcloud that is great for the workday.

We didn't pay for bottle service but stuck around and just ordered from the bar. Lots of attractive young people in the crowd. It got a little crowded but service seemed good. My only criticism is they have tables for bottle service everywhere even right in front of the DJ. There was not real place to dance and made circulation a little tricky at times."}
{"text":"Un incontournable de la cuisine japonaise à Montreal! L endroit est sublime et mystérieux...à ne pas confondre avec le bistro juste à côté! 
Pour découvrir ce lieu original, il vous faudra descendre un escalier tout en pierre pour rejoindre l'accueil! L endroit est assez bas de plafond et tout en pierre comme si on était dans des catacombes!
Il y a plusieurs salles et un grand bar où s'affairent de nombreux serveurs et barmans.
En entrée, j ai pris des makis de printemps et des dim-sums au poulet. Les deux étaient très bien préparés et très goûteux! J ai ensuite commande un saumon aux petits légumes et purée vitelotte!
Je recommande ce plat qui est une pure merveille! Le saumon est arrivé avec la cuisson exacte que j avais demandé (juste retourné) et les condiments étaient croquants (voire très croquants mais ça ne m'a pas dérangé), le tout accompagné d'une purée de vitelotte crémeuse! Un régal! 
Je vous préviens quand même que les prix sont moyens, voire un peu élevés! Sinon le service est de qualité!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for a 9:30 reservation. The service was good, our waitress was Bianca (she's amazing!!!!). Spent the time explaining the drinks and menu to us. The food came out quick which is nice when your hungry. I highly recommend getting the Tuna Sashimi and the cooked cod. The restaurant turns into a club at 11, but they did not rush us out of the table. As a New Yorker I was very pleased with this treatment. Will be visiting this place again on my next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"Des qu'on rentre on est tout de suite mis dans l'ambiance avec un bouncer qui vous regarde de la tete au pied et qui ne vous adresse pas la parole. Quand ils ont daigné nous laisser rentrer, j'ai vraiment pas aimé mon experience. La musique est vraiment trop forte même pour un club . Heureusement les cocktails sont corrects. Mais l'accueil est vraiment nase. NOPE"}
{"text":"Came here after dinner on a Friday night to go out for a birthday celebration. Amazing ambiance- you enter down a flight of stairs with gold wallpaper- and enter a beautiful room with romantic lighting and two large bars. The crowd is a mix of well-dressed, young professionals and also has older age groups as well. Awesome DJ spinning loud, fun music. Around 11 PM the dinner crowd clears out and they take away the bar stools and chairs and it turns into a nightclub. It does get crowded later in the night, so it is best to arrive early. A very fun club that I will definitely return to when I come back to Montreal!"}
{"text":"I've came to Flyjin on several ocassions, dinner, oyster night and dancing. I've always had a great time when I go, and I've definitely returned! It's a really trendy spot for a night out and the decor is gorgeous.

Good : Wednesday night is $1 oyster nights, I usually just get two dozen oysters and tropical salad (get it, it's REALLY good!). The beef sashimi and yellow tail sashimi, it's so light and flavorful, probably the stand out dishes for me. If you have to get one hot plate, I suggest the lobster dumplings...to die for. Side Note: their staff, seriously, what a good looking bunch, and they're very courteous too. 

Bad : The dessert, not so much that it tastes bad, but there's no price on the menu, and only after you get the bill, you'll find out its $15 for a bite size plate. 

Bottom Line : I like this place, the music and ambiance is good, so I keep going back!"}
{"text":"Not only a great place to go dance late but also an amazing restaurant where you shall find the best Albacore Tuna Tataki in town."}
{"text":"Had a few people recommend this place for both a supper spot and for the club.   We went elsewhere for supper on this Friday night - but close to 11:30pm decided to head over here to check it out... You would never run into this place by accident - almost no signage and it's in the basement !  This place is a restaurant from about 8:30pm to 11:30 - then they clear the tables and it becomes a night club.. 

When we arrived at about midnight - there was already a long line up - the lineup is in an alley as you enter from the back.  Good thing of the people in our party knew the owner so we went right in.   Nice layout, a lot of great looking women and great music.  Drinks are a little on the pricy side - I had a number of Hendricks and Seven @ $12.00 plus tip each!

Great vibe but if you don't want to stand in line reserved for dinner and stay for the club!"}
{"text":"I was in town and visited this hot spot referred by a local friend. The menu was broad and diverse but I wasn't really starving for all that it offered. So I landed on pork dumplings and the seafood lemongrass soup. OMG - sooooo good and flavorful. Great ambience, real cool hype background music and awesome bartender who made a special drink to order for me. 

I went on a Wed and was able to get in w/o a reservation. Unfortunately, I didn't stick around to see the nightclub transformation but I would agree if you walk too fast you will miss this hidden gem. I am not an Oyster lover so I did not take advantage of the 12 for $12 special but others did and seemed to enjoy them. 

Bottom line:  it is a great spot to meet for drinks, sashimi and what not. Cool vibe, beautiful people and delish dishes. You can't go wrong that's for sure!"}
{"text":"So, the place was very cool. I loved the fact that we had to go through the tunnel/ stairs to get there. Dont get me wrong the vibe was sick and it was our first time there. UPSIDE: we ordered two mojitos. Asked the bartender to pay them separately. They were 11$ each on the dot on the bill so i asked him how much each and he said 13$. Alright, I figured with tip. So i pass him by 20$ bill and he goes are you from Montreal? I said yes, he said you need to pay tip. I said you said 13$ that obviously includes tip, then he said I cant serve you anymore.. so i gave him extra 3$ change that he gave me and walked away. He took put threw it in his li"}
{"text":"Had reservation for 4 girls and was spending lot of money on bottle service. The \"bouncer\" in the fake Gucci tracks suit told me I didn't have a reservation, even though I had email confirmation. He asked if I could afford a 4,000$ reservation mean while I had a 5,000$ chanel purse on. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"I've only discovered this place recently. Good and staff are phenomenal and if you make it to this place on a Thursday through Saturday night, you can expect this place to transform into a stellar nightlife dance bar. Only very recommendable to anyone seeking great food, great athmostphere and an all around great time in Montreal."}
{"text":"Pros :

- Oysters are $1 on Wednesdays and that's a great deal! They were tasty and came with a really nice sesame dressing that I enjoyed.

- The place is very aesthetically pleasing. Warm and inviting with comfortable seating to be had. It was quiet during my 7 to 9 PM stay and started to get more noisy around the time I left.

Cons :

- Price-tag for most items is unreasonable but then again.... perhaps it's because it's located at the old port. A hard sell for me.

- Service was quite slow and honestly left our group somewhat miffed at some of the answers provided by the waitress.

- My $12 margarita drink was seriously watered down. A small drinking glass was found after ordering this expensive drink and it was filled to the rim with ice cubes! Furthermore, the drink was almost tasteless?!? Very disappointing. Water will be fine.

I'd come back on Wednesdays for Oysters and a glass of water."}
{"text":"A bit pricy (6 of us and the bill was $600). The food was great, specially the cod and the chicken dumplings. The server was great but he had to switch tables at midnight. I could write more but the stomach craves poutine.."}
{"text":"This review is just for the cocktails and after-hours club-type scene....wow. Super fun!

Cocktails were superb (try the one with pear) and although the music wasn't my favourite, it was fun enough to dance and enjoy some late-night antics among the young and beautiful.

Good times."}
{"text":"Food : Excellent. Definitely up to par. Highly recommend the sashimi and the beef tartare. Very bold flavors and decently priced wine.

Service : the male staff is very helpful, knowledgeable, polite and actually nice. The female staff (with the exception of one whom i unfortunately forgot her name) is, well... let's just say they needed female staff. I understand that the fact that i'm a girl, i might get poorer service, but they are actually not so knowledgeable (to avoid using any other word).

Very trendy and great music. Love this place."}
{"text":"Amazing place to get some oysters (go on Wednesday's for their $1 special). Great vibes and delicious appetizers!"}
{"text":"Visited here on a Saturday night. Just a caution to anybody getting bottles here...no matter how the service is, they will DEMAND a tip from you...even if they don't deserve it. 

When I refused to give them the tip they demanded, they withheld my jacket and claimed it was lost. I refused to leave without my jacket and they made me wait 2 hours, and then kicked me out and told me to come back a few days later to attempt to reclaim my jacket. Completely unacceptable for a place like this. EXERCISE CAUTION GOING HERE."}
{"text":"Les cocktails sans alcool sont bons. Celui au gimbembre et ananas ainsi que celui avec l'orange.
En guise d'accompagnement on a mangé des dumplings au porc et poulet. Le reste de la carte est assez cher (effet vieux montréal ?) et clairement la serveuse ne m'a pas vendu de rêve quand je lui ai posé des questions sur les sashimis ...
10$ pour 5 dumplings c'est assez cher, la sauce piquante est bonne mais il n'y a rien d'extraordinaire dans leur gout. Cela ne justifie clairement pas les 10$.
Pas emballé pour cette première, je ne pense pas à une deuxième chance malheureusement pour eux."}
{"text":"Came here on a saturday night. We were a table of 12. The place itself is really nice, the music is good and i like the ambiance. I just don't suggest eating there, it's not that the food is not good, it's just that the food is OK and it's a bit pricy for the portions. I honestly was expecting more of this place maybe that's why i was disappointed a little. I had the salmon tartare and it was just ok, i have had way better. The drinks are good, service is good too. I just suggest you go there for a drink and for the music not for the food, you can have better somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went for 7pm on a Wednesday for oysters, dumplings and cocktails and I really loved it - it's so satisfying to see fun, lovely, tasty things happening in the Old Port. I love ducking underground to an unmarked bar and suddenly walking in to a wide low beautiful room, long benches, interesting design, super friendly staff. The oysters were Green Gables, fat sweet salt meaty, perfectly shucked, super fresh - really surprisingly great for dollar oyster days when you kind of worry/expect not the best quality. 

When we left around 9 it was filling up and the atmosphere was changing to a more party, yelling, rollicking scene which might appeal to some but I was glad to be rolling out with the changing of the tides."}
{"text":"The entrance was a little tough to find considering its one of three doors in and entrance way so be sure to have the address on hand. The coat check girl and hostess were quite inviting, but beyond that the service left a big something to be desired. 

Our table was visited by the friendly gentleman refilling water glasses more often than we noticed our waitress around. We joined our group late, but after dropping off our chairs she kind of forgot about us and we sat waiting for a menu. We weren't ready to order our drinks when she passed and then had to flag her down because she didn't look around / make eye contact with people at our tables when she was back around. 

We ordered Stairway to Buddha(4/5) and Hattori Hanzo(1/5). $12 for a drink is fine, and yes, some places serve it topped with too much ice, but that left these drinks very low on flavor and incredibly unimpressive considering the good reviews for this place. Had a sip off a cucumber / mint gin tonic which was quite good. Their cocktails look nice, but that's it. 

When we attempted to order food with our table, we were told our order would need to be placed with the other table of the group a few minutes later. (You put our napkins on one table, our drinks on another, then our food has to be part of the first table even though we'll be eating at the second table?)

We tried the dumplings and I like that they made the effort to spice the dip. We ordered sashimi and soup as well. The sashimi was served before the soup, not like we were asked if we wanted our appetizer before our entrée. The sashimi was mediocre, really nothing that would have been ordered again.  The soup however was enjoyed and had a solid flavor to it. 

Despite constantly passing by to the clean the table, the waitress never once asked anyone at the table about their food or drink. Not once. Considering her hovering while cleaning, I really don't understand why not. We were never checked on, offered another round, mentioned desserts, really zero service in that regard. 

Overall, nice ambiance, hit or miss food (grab an order of dumplings to be safe), poor service and mixed reviews on drinks.  $70+tip for 2 drinks, a soup and a mediocre entrée. For the price they have the capacity and expectation to do far better than this. Would be very surprised if I went back. 

Service 1/5
Price 3/5
Quality 3/5
Ambiance 4/5"}
{"text":"Flyjin is hidden behind a mysterious door and the only indication this is the correct door is the little logo that you may not have paid attention to while browsing their web page. Behind the door, down the stairs we can find beautifully decorated bar with a nice ambiance and overall attentive service.

I feel compelled to start with what truly impressed me in Flyjin: the hamachi sashimi with yuzu sauce. My dish was so beautiful that I keep browsing my pictures of it over and over again in admiration. The entire dish was a mastered art, perfectly arranged, the ikebana of the sashimi, so gorgeous that I had to eat half of the fish before I could identify the location of the wasabi, hiding shyly under the orange flower. The ingredients of the dish were very fresh, the yellow tail tuna was good. My little concern, I can get the same quality and quantity of fish, without the the decoration, in other places, for less money, and the sushi snob in me says that we eat sashimi for the fish, not the decoration.... Anyway, when I come again I wouldn't mind ordering the very same sashimi, in the end I now know where to look for the wasabi. 

Besides that the Wednesday oyster deal is great and the oysters were tasty. My only problem, the reason for the three star review, are the cocktails, too much ice, they feel watery quickly if you let them sit a little big longer. The Zen Buddha was extremely refreshing, but felt deprived of alcohol. The Campfire Margarita was stronger, but again you need to drink it quickly before the ice melts. I guess I will opt for the wine list next time as I can see myself visiting again for oysters treat."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would....who goes to a \"club\" that has no dancing...with people just staring at each other awkwardly. It's cramped and crowded - music is terrible. No clue why people would want to come here."}
{"text":"This is the best bar in Montreal, maybe north America. I'm serious. Whoever rated this less than 4 stars has stars is missing the point. The vibe is untouchable. The Decor is so tasteful. Underground with Stone walls, strong colorful lighting, Asian infuses nuances, and well put together crowd.  The music is always next level - strong Deep house roots but the DJs are feeling the crowd and mixing in top 40 remixes when necessary to keep the place moving. Every time I'm in Montreal I do whatever it takes to come here. Dinner, drinks or dancing / this is A must see spot."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time last saturday night for a casual dinner. My friends and I booked a table 5 days before through email then through phone and staff was very courteous.

Food was delicious. I ordered pork dumplings and black cod. They were both tasty. I highly recommend the white chocolate brownie if it's still available. It's a must. Close to paradise. Plus, it's gluten free.

Cocktails were also good and unique since mixologists use specific ingredients to add to their blend. 

This high-end japanese brasserie is inviting and warming."}
{"text":"Le service est pourrie, le restaurant pu, il n'y a pas beaucoup de choix d'alcool, et pour coroner le tout, j'ai été malade après avoir manger la bas. J'ai pris les légumes grillés puisque c'était pratiquement le seule plat végétarien, il y avais une genre de mayo super l'huileuse c'était vraiment pas appétissant."}
{"text":"I love their $1 oysters on Wednesday's! The oysters are big and fresh and it comes wit two mignonette... one that tastes of strawberries and one that tastes of sesame oil. The first time I went I tried their black miso cod. I've definitely had better. The second time I had the $1 oysters, of course ,the lobster gyoza which are in triangular form like samosas, the salmon tartare and the lobster tail. All were very good but I would skip the lobster tail next time. I went again last wednesday with my girl friends and we each ordered two dozen oysters. I also tried a few of the cocktails and they were all very good!! I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I went on a Wednesday night with my boyfriend. It was a little hard to find because my bf likes to wing it with the address -- conveniently when I'm in high heels... *eye roll.* if it weren't for two other ladies heading through the correct doors, we would have thought the place was closed lol (hint: choose the middle wooden door! It leads to happiness I promise!!!) 

The ambience was amazing. The restaurant is downstairs and it's dark and mysterious but very chic. We went there for the $1 oysters. we didn't have any reservations, but they still sat us. We got seats at the bar in this cozy two person seating area.

My boyfriend face when he opened the menu -- amazement. Guy was completely blown away from the light up menus, it was totally unexpected. We didn't order anything off the main menu. But the drink menu was definitely where it's at. The bartender was amazing he made me a special drink that was not on the menu and it had a shot of ginseng extract. It was to die for. My boyfriend got captain Korea off the drink menu and it was delicious. I can tell the guy behind the bar was a magician because there was a lot of though behind his work and everything he produced was magic in a glass. I saw him make a few drinks for a few other ladies at the bar and he did an amazing job with the drink garnishes and choice of glass.

Overall it is a beautiful place, expensive though. Our bill came out to be 59 for 2 cocktails, a beer and 14 oysters. I wish we stayed later because I heard this place turns into a club."}
{"text":"Came here last week for a Yelp! event with Risa and the crew and had a grand time slurping on oysters and noshing on dumplings. 

VERY happy to know that there is a $1 oyster night on Wednesdays somewhere in Montreal to fulfill my oyster cravings. Old Montreal and the uber-cooler-than-thou crowd is normally not my scene. You just get the feeling there are a lot of beautiful people here who all seem to have a lot of cash but no one really works. It's either that, or older techy guys executives who work in the Old Montreal gaming industry.  My understanding is that this places becomes a really-hard-to-get-into club after 11:30pm  so I guess if that's your scene, you best bet is to come here for cocktails, dinner and then just stay on.  
That's the scene and vibe. Now the food.

Oysters were fresh and fantastic, briny and plump, just the way they should be. I tried both the pork dumplings and ordered the lobster dumplings. Again, fantastic. Cocktails were just as great.

I don't see myself coming here for the club part, but I'll definitely come here during the winter for oysters and drinks. For the summer, I want the same but outdoors and given that Flyjin is in some warren-like, hard to find basement, I'll definitely pass in the summer."}
{"text":"Great resto bar I really enjoyed was there for dinner around 7 pm bilingual waiters c'etait parfait la selection de vin good, the appetizers good, the main dishes good because I had salmon and my date had cod. A resto in the old port that I advise... people really started coming around 8-9.. good place 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"Great place for drinks with friends. Ambiance is really fun. Food is decent. Worth the try."}
{"text":"Perhaps the most wonderful Montreal restaurant/club for a Saturday night. I recommend the salmon or tuna sashimi and lobster dumplings. Try the Dragon Passion."}
{"text":"Went there for diner on a Friday night. And No, it wasn't for the $1 oysters ! 
Oysters night is on Wednesdays. I won't be able to give you more details about oysters night as I never tried it, but I bet that most of the other reviews are talking about it.

Coming back to my night, I arrived early around 9pm. 
By walking down the stairs to get in, you feel like you're going to one of these underground clubs like in the movies. At the end of the stairs, you're welcomed by a nice hostess. I already made reservations at the bar. 

At that hour, the place is not crowded. You can enjoy your diner while listening to good music.
We ordered the salmon tartar and salmon maki for starters. Then we ordered the salmon tataki and filet mignon as main corse.
The quality of the food is outstanding. You can feel the freshness of the salmon  and the filet mignon  melts in your mouth.

At 11pm the place gets crowded. The chairs at the bar are removed.
You can still stay at the bar and enjoy their vast selection of cocktails, Saké, premium alcohol, wine and Japanese beers.
By 11:30pm the place is packed.
The music gets even better and trendy.

Lets not forget to mention that the service is great.
When you sit at the bar, it is the bar tender who takes care of your orders (food & drink)."}

- It's the brown wooden door.
- Wednesdays until 10:30pm, $1 oysters, order by the dozen
- Sitting at the bar means watching the expert bartenders make their art!

Flyjin is a fancy underground restaurant that turns into a lounge at 11pm. For dinner, music is quiet, the lights are dim, and few people are around. By 11, the lights stay dim, the ambient music is much, much louder (you cannot hear your neighbour anymore). And they take all the chairs away. We stood by the bar. I like their music actually! It was pretty crowded at 11 on the Wednesday night.

I LOVE the condiments for the oysters, the one with sesame is delicious!! 

The cocktails are $12 each, all are very sweet except the Tonic of course. I'm not a huge fan of their cocktails and I've had four (not on the same night)
- Stairway to Buddha - sweet
- Zen to Buddha - sweet, citrus. Loaded with ice
- Campfire Margarita - just wanted it for that marshmallow, too watery for me
- Flyjin Tonic - sweet! with tonic, it's okay

I decided to try before deciding I don't like them. Next time, I'll order a glass of wine. The cocktails I find are delicious and sweet, but they are more fruity juices than cocktails. You can drink it all in one gulp. Watching the bartenders make these drinks is fun. A fire show!!

The chicken dumplings are $10 for 5, expensive for tasty dumplings. The dipping sauce is super delicious!!! The dumplings were tasty but not amazing, not worth the $10. But the $10 is really for the vibe.

I personally like the vibe. I wouldn't quite want to eat here for dinner but I do like the setting. I also had great service for both the nights I came. The staff are quick and very polite. I'd take someone here for a night out, it's relaxed but fancy enough and without any crazy clubbing dancing."}
