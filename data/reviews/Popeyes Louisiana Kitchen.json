{"text":"Best popeyes location. Great service. Owners are hands on and appreciate every customer. Very clean. Has alot of space to eat comfortably. The spicy wings are the truth!"}
{"text":"There are days, when this shit is on my mind. Then it sinks down to my stomach and I find myself heading to Popeyes. But stay focused, because its also a minimart gas station, so if your a people person, like me, its like TV, they also have one blaring too. You can also feel outlawish, by getting \"free\" refills. They also have wi-fi, so you can slow your heart and arteries with greasy chicken and gravy with lots of salt and butter and comb or stalk whatever sites you desire. Plus look at all the weirdos coming and going. Oh and for you antique people, just behind this location is a big ass antique store, so you can waddle your way over, most drive, cause we americans, and settle that chicken looking at stuff you don't need."}
{"text":"The worst place been there twice same nasty service  how can this place be open with this kind of rude Spanish people and I am Spanish is embarrassing"}
{"text":"Twice in the last few weeks, my fiancé and I have visited. Twice we've been disappointed. 

Both times we've visited, we ordered the same thing, the Rippn' Chicken, which is a feature item on their menu. Each time we've ordered, they've had to cook it from frozen, as they never had any ready to serve. While it is frustrating to see people walk in behind you and leave with their food while you're waiting for yours, I do appreciate that the alternative is eating chicken that may have been sitting quite a while. 

What I do not appreciate, though, is being forgotten. I watched as the onion rings I ordered were put in the fryer after my chicken was ready. The guy behind the counter tried to tell me that the onion rings take longer to prepare. (This is true; they do take longer to cook when you put them down after the rest of the order is ready!) He assured me that he'd bring them to me when they were ready. 

I ate my chicken, my fiancé ate her chicken and fries. No onion rings came. I went to the counter, and the same guy who served me and promised to bring my rings when they were ready said \"Oh, it was that good, you're back for more?\" 

SERIOUSLY??? 

I told him that he hadn't brought my onion rings, he played dumb, pretending to not know what I was talking about. When I demanded a refund, he remembered, and spoke with his manager in a foreign language. I found this to be extremely ignorant. The only reason someone who speaks perfect English would choose to speak another language in front of a customer is the fact that they have something to hide. In this case, it was the fact that they had messed up the order due to ineptitude. 

A closer location to us has opened, but my level of confidence is not high. These people have absolutely no business working in food service."}
{"text":"Went to their drive thru. Woman behind the window looked and sounded mean. She's a Latina. She's not suppose to be in a customer service industry, in my opinion. I ordered the 8 piece chicken with 4 biscuits and one side. I asked her to make the side into just a large gravy instead. She told me she can't because it's more expensive than a side. I asked her how much the difference is. It actually has the same price. My husband was able to do this the last time we bought here and now she's telling me that they're not allowed because the gravy is not considered a side...REALLY??? Because I got annoyed, I changed my order into the 8 piece chicken only and a large SIDE of gravy...it's the first time I saw a box of chicken shoved sideways into a small plastic bag, just as the other reviews here have mentioned. This store doesn't seem like they wanted to please their customers at all...When I got home and opened the box, some of the chicken were not freshly cooked. It seems like it's been refried again or microwaved because the meat were already too dry and kinda jerky and have absorbed a lot of grease in it....YUCK!!! Never again will I buy from this place. I would rather go to the other store on the other side of Craig Road by Tenaya...You just lost a repeat customer because of bad customer service and some reheated, stale chicken pieces...NEVER AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"You want the deal on tv? Well they don't honor that at this location & also your chicken will not be hot which means not fresh. $10 to the trash. What morons hired these morons? They need to quit & hire people that will do the job right."}
{"text":"Food is fine, just what you'll expect from any other franchise under the same name. However Customer Courtesy is down the floor, every time I've been there they give off this who care don't care vibe.

You ask them nicely for meal suggestions or question about the products, and they just blow you off with some lame answer that doesn't even address your original question. 

Like asking if they can put more white meat or brown meat, and they answer buy fish...  like seriously WTH?!

or simply asking for suggestions which combo to get, but you tell them you don't want sandwich, and they answer get the chicken sandwich"}
{"text":"Decided to have lunch here today. Served quickly by friendly waitress. Prices reasonable. Portion size not too big. Sadly however we found our food cold. It appears it had been on the press some time and is not cooked to order. A very angry customer was having a run in with the manager, which was not being dealt with effectively. This was difficult to watch and listen too. 
I think it's very offensive when the supervise decided to talk to her staff about the customer in her native tongue as well as laughing. Very unprofessional indeed."}
{"text":"We come here at least once a month and everyone here is usually really nice. The last time we came a very not caring young lady helped out , if u can call it that.... it was 5 hours till close and they were out of Spicy chicken, and asked if we wanted anything else...ya drop some more! Thats what this restaurant is KNOWN for!! She huffed and asked if they would drop some and told us it would be a wait...Wtf...it was that easy?????
Thats fine Chicky just help out , try to care for your pay. Then got the order wrong at the end and forgot our tea.
So we tried again today, and lucky us her lovey face was waiting for us to order....I ordered my son chicken tenders and they were out till tomorrow !WHAT???!! I asked if some could be dropped , got a huff and told they are too frozen .... I asked about the empty chicken racks , she said there was a wait for everything. Mind you, the card machines were down and it was cash only , they weren't busy at all.
 I asked when they close, it was in 5 hours! Soooo maybe getting a prep work done would have been smart.
I  asked for the manager,  couldnt handle the blank stare of the cashier who only showed she wished to be anywhere but here. The manager came up , I told her about last time and this time , she was so sweet and helpful , I got everything I came in to order , just had to wait an extra 20 mins for cooking. A nice attitude asking me to wait doesn't bother me. 
I did get to watch how many people came in while waiting and were mad, not because of the card machines being down, but the lack of available food and poor attitude of the cashier. I've worked customer service for 20+ years and know they we all have bad days but we are getting paid to take care of our customers, not give a shitty attitudes to start .
I suffer from an incurable and painful disorder, gosh do I know bad days! But I never let my patients feel that,  they dont deserve that. 
I was really surprised nothing was offered extra to us like a coupon discount or  pie or whatever , just as a gesture of good will .
Will we go back and hit 3 strikes...not sure , might just go back to Churches , they are ALWAYS kind there."}
{"text":"I love popeyes chicken but this location wasn't as good as I had in Atlanta and Arlington.  Every table in the place was dirty. Chicken was not great seemed to be sitting to long. Won't come to this location again."}
{"text":"Its an average place.. I had popeye's chicken in different location but this one is not even close.. just got sick.."}
{"text":"Food was hot and delicious. Staff was friendly and quick. I tried the pepper barrel tenders. Yum!"}
{"text":"I am disgusted by this location. My food fell out  the box as they were putting it in and was on counter..they scooped it back in the box in front of me. I understand it was the food prep counter but it was not clean and I would prefer my food from tray to box without a trip on a dirty counter. I asked why I was being served food that touched other things,they said it never happened...apparently I fell asleep while waiting for my food and dreamed the whole thing .The \"training expert\" Perry then says it is OK to eat and that's that. Well! As long as Perry says the counter chicken is good enough to eat I must accept.Customer service was bad,workers were dismissive.In addition, chicken strip was partially raw and chicken was beyond oily.I'm done with this place for good! Oh and the bathrooms are nasty no matter what time of day! Thanks Perry!"}
{"text":"Food is very good. Often times have to wait for chicken which is a good sign. However, if you order 8 pieces or more, and they are busy, they often substitute pieces for others. I ordered 12 pieces on several occasions and they have substituted chicken breasts with chicken drumsticks because they did not have enough breasts to put into the order."}
{"text":"Had to wait for order to be done, which to me I know it'll be fresh!
Place was busy behind the counter and drive thru but only a few people in the store.
The order was correct and hot when I got it home."}
{"text":"?Popeye's started as a restaurant in New Orleans Louisiana in 1972 serving a southern style menu. The franchise started in 1992 in Atlanta Georgia. Although some people believe may think this restaurant has a relation with the cartoon character Popeye, it does not. The name came from a 1970's TV detective named Popeye Doyle played by Gene Hackman. They have items on their menu such as fried chicken, shrimp, jambalaya, red beans and rice and other different types of items like these. They use Cajun spices to season there food unlike other chicken restaurants such as Church's, KFC, and Chic-Fil-A. The Popeye's on 7th St. and Central Ave. is a somewhat newer restaurant. They have not even been open a year at that location yet.
?The location I would say is a great location as far as attracting customers. It is right next to Sunnyslope High School, and across a common business plaza with a high traffic area. Driving into the location can be difficult due to the high traffic at times. The size of the restaurant is a little small but it still packs a punch. As we went into the restaurant we noticed that even though it is new, it seems to be well taken care of. The staff seemed to be welcoming throughout our visit. We ordered an assortment of chicken tenders, jambalaya, red beans and rice, with a couple chicken po'boys. The food all came out hot and the chicken was crispy. The jambalaya was tasty although being used to southwestern food we didn't have other types of jambalaya to compare it to. We all agreed that the biscuits were delicious and unique from any other restaurant biscuit we had. Popeye's has a tea they sell which was actually pretty good.
?Overall this restaurant seemed to be a pleasant experience. It was a little pricier than other chicken restaurant competitors. But quality does usually cost a little more to help maintain the integrity of the taste. We would recommend anyone interested in southern style chicken to go to Popeye's. The taste is different from the usual types of food here in the southwest. And even though it is fried chicken, they use peanut oil to fry there food which is healthier. For anyone who is not interested in spicy foods they also offer mild flavors. On a scale of 1 to 5 we give Popeye's a 5."}
{"text":"We went through drive-thru tonight and the lady at the window repeated our order and when we got home our Cajun fries was not in the bag!!!!! This is the second time this Popeyes has done this. I called and there is no answer. This is not a hard job to do!! These people at this store can't ever get it right. I'm not happy at all with this store. I will not be going back to this store. Thanks people for messing up the easiest job and charging me for something once again I didn't receive!!! This store sucks period!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is like any other fast food chain; you get what you pay for. The reason for the two star rating is the service. Every time I've gone to this location they've made a mistake, which I don't see until I get home, and the staff is generally unfriendly and more concerned with their own conversations."}
{"text":"worst service and very rude behavior.. very disappointed. ... i dont think i will ever visit this place again"}
{"text":"Received the wrong order and the service was horrible. First time here and will never come again!"}
{"text":"This location is a disaster. I was there a week ago and we had to wait 10 minutes for our meal and they forgot the biscuits. That's not even the worst part. The worst part about this whole experience was the customer service. All the employees are so slow!! Like they don't care that there are orders to be made! We asked for our food to dine in and they gave it to us to go. And they forgot the biscuits. When we finally got the biscuits we had to wait ten minutes for an employee to find plates, napkins and forks. 10 out of 10 do not recommend. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"I was at this particular Popeyes, about an hour ago. I'm more of a KFC kind of person but, I was right by and decided to give it a try. I drove up to the speaker box on their drive thru lane; I was immediately greeted, I was offered to listen to their specials, I ordered a special combo with chicken, fries, a biscuit & a drink for $4.99. I asked the order taker if it was possible for her to hold the biscuit and substitute for fries instead, she kindly said it wasn't possible, so I said that's fine just hold the biscuit; I wasn't going to eat it, & I didn't want it to go to waste.. Before completing my order I asked her to upsize my drink to a large, and so I thought she did. When drove up to the window, she was nice, but not enthusiastic, just the minimum.. I paid she gave me my drink a SMALL drink, and when I got home I opened the box & the first thing I see is a golden buttery BISCUIT. I rated my overall experience 2 stars, because the service was fast, but my order wasn't correct due to the lack of attention to detail. From other reviews I've read it seems the employees should be oriented on customer service."}
{"text":"Watch for overcharging. Went through the drive thru. Ordered a chicken strip 5 pc blackened according to the menu it was 8.99 plus tax. They then tried to charge me almost $12 for a mysterious up charge on blackened chicken."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this \"restaurant\" zero stars.  I've eaten here three times now and each time, the food was HORRIBLE.  The chicken strips, drumsticks, and thighs are tiny, overcooked, and shriveled. 

The service is awful, too.  If there's a long line, you can bet that there's one person working the register and four employees standing around and looking dumb.  There's no hustle at all.  They clearly don't care for you.

The only good news is that students in Oakland have a lot of options, and they'll soon figure out that this place isn't worth it.  Soon enough, this place will become yet another empty, roach filled monument to incompetence."}
{"text":"Went there tonight with my husband, the food was prepared kind of quick. We got home and there were more crunch than meat on the tenders not only that the meat was extremely dry, the fries were chewy. The manager looked as if she had a problem with people ordering food. The whole establishment is terrible, the worst I probably will never go there"}
{"text":"close to my office, so went there for week day lunch. they have daily special every day, good value. and I think they have better fried chicken than KFC."}
{"text":"A glorious establishment focused on giving you quality food at a reasonable price point. Although there is usually odorous patrons sleeping in the restaurant, and parts of my order are almost always forgotten, I love coming to this place."}
{"text":"Literally the slowest place I've ever been...the service was slow and horrible...won't be back"}
{"text":"The food is great but their service is horrible. I called a few weeks ago to order something for delivery. First of all, they advertise free delivery but they actually charge for it...even if you live across the street. Secondly, their communication skills are just unacceptable. I didn't end up ordering. Today, I had guests over and they wanted popeyes. I ordered a combo worth $40 and they wanted to charge for delivery..so i chose the pick up option instead. When I placed the order, I asked if the food came with fries and was told it comes with two sides of fries. Then I was asked what two sides I wanted so I picked two sides while under the impression that I'd get the fries too. Wrong. No one explained to me that those would be the only two sides. I called when I got home to ask why there were no fries...no apology, nothing. I'm not sure they care for repeat customers. Good luck guys...I will never step foot in your place of business again. I will also ensure to share my story with all my friends and family."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch at 11:15. (Store opened at 11:00) they said they don't have any chicken ready. That's right no chicken at Popeye's and they said it wouldn't be ready for while. That's pride in your work...I walked out"}
{"text":"The faculty and food is atrocious- but then again, maybe that's the allure after all? Attempts to contact management haven't been returned."}
{"text":"Really scared me off when I read this review about this location. But because it was closest by I went anyways. Food was fine , service wasn't rude."}
{"text":"The food is good except for their order execution. I come here about 3 times a month to get my fried chicken fix and they only got my order right maybe five times. And they always question me when I say that's not what I ordered. I just order a 3 piece meal all drumsticks with mashed potatoes and a additional side of jambalaya. They always get it wrong. It's really frustrating because I love the food! Plus I came once and they told me there were out of honey. How the hell do you run out of honey and not realize you need to order more! So far the only one that is pretty consistent every time I come is Maliq. But even sometimes he gets it wrong. Oh well."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some fried chicken while passing through. This was the first Popeyes I've been to since they've migrated to Canada. I'd like to say that this location lived up to their namesake. 

I went with the 3 pieces of regular friend chicken, fries and a biscuit. The chicken was off the charts compared to KFC. It had a nice spice to it and the batter was perfectly crispy.

There wasn't any wait and the inside of the restaurant was clean, which must be no small feat considering how busy it was."}
{"text":"They must be under new management now since the other reviews are pretty good. My fiancé and I placed an online order for delivery at this location using just-eat.ca. Let me start off by saying that this is , without a doubt, the WORST service that I have ever received in my entire life! This is coming from someone who orders A LOT of delivery online from various restaurants and chains. The staff at 181 Eglinton Avenue East are rude, incompetent, and unprofessional. 

Issue 1 - The delivery driver. 
While on the road, the delivery driver called us to complain about how we wrote our delivery address in the online order. I answered the phone. He was extremely rude to me, and harshly told me to \"make life easy\" for him. Mind you, we always make sure that our delivery address is written clearly, and is very easy to understand. We have NEVER had anyone complain about the way our delivery address was written, so I couldn't figure out what the confusion was on his part. I should also mention, that having placed this order online via just-eat.ca and paying via credit card, we also included an already paid for $5 tip for the delivery driver. BIG MISTAKE! The order cost $33 before tip. So factoring all of that into consideration, I was pretty shocked and disgusted by the delivery driver's lack of respect and professionalism.

I should also mention that once we received the order, we were able to verify that the delivery address was written, clear as day, on the delivery receipt. It was also written in a way that pretty much ANYONE, should have been able to understand. 

When the delivery driver arrived and handed my fiancé the food, I asked him what the confusion regarding the delivery address was all about. He did not respond, and when my fiancé asked for his name (so that we could file a complaint), he immediately bolted out of our apartment complex. We were not confrontational in any way. He did not offer an apology for his rude behaviour over the phone, nor did he even thank us for the already paid for $5 tip. My fiancé immediately contacted the restaurant to file a complaint. The employee that he spoke with was needless to say, incompetent. She couldn't figure out what the problem was after he explained our experience with the delivery driver. He requested a call back from the manager, which to my surprise, we received within an hour after making the complaint. However, according to my fiancé, the manager seemed rushed and uninterested in his complaint. My fiancé mentioned that he got the impression that he was telling him what he wanted to hear just to get him off the phone as quickly as possible. He did offer an apology for the delivery driver's behaviour, so I'll give him that at least.. 

Issue 2 - The order. 
The order arrived 15 minutes late. The order was placed in the afternoon. Traffic was fine. The delivery driver (to no surprise) did not offer an apology for arriving late. Also, they gave us a mix of spicy and mild chicken in our family meal. We didn't order a mix of spicy and mild, we ordered mild ONLY. My fiancé and I can't tolerate a lot of spice, so this was a HUGE disappointment! 

Terrible, terrible service, avoid this location at all costs!"}
{"text":"Do your self a favor and don't ever go to this popeyes. Waited over 40 mins in the drive thru for an 8 pc meal. Slowest service ever. My turtle walks faster than they can cook."}
{"text":"I love their food... but unfortunately everytime I come to this location, the service sucks. They don't know the value of the \"FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED\" basis because there's simply none in this location. I always end up disappointed here."}
{"text":"Recently moved here from LA where i was introduced to Popeyes and eating fried chicken and biscuits covered in velvety honey, so i was very excited when i discovered it was here in toronto. made the journey up on a pretty cold night and it did not disappoint. The place isn't the nicest looking popeyes and kinda messy (we had clean our table before we sat down) but don't let that through u off. ordered a family meal with mashed potatoes and biscuits. chicken was ammmmaaazzing. pipping hot, crispy yet still moist and succulent. very good. couple that with the biscuits (freshly made) its was to die for. Don't forget to ask for honey for ure biscuits and hot sauce for ure chicken (for mini-packet condiments, they were both very good). Mashed potatoes were tasty but not memorable. All in all, a very enjoyable meal and highly recommend if ure lookin to fix a fried chicken craving, which i was."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Two employees got into an argument in front of us, then forgot our order. We reminded them we still needed our food, and they gave us the wrong stuff! Are you serious?!"}
{"text":"I came to this place a few times and I have to say it has one of the worst customer service, if they hate their job so much maybe they shouldnt be working there. When running a business like this you need to have a friendly staff that can take orders right and not be rude to your customers. I always went thru drive thru and the supervisor that works drive thru is rude, non friendly, bad vibe. I love Popeyes but would rather give business to Pollo Loco or Church Chicken for better customer service. WIll never come back again, I had asked the supervisor for the person in charge of her and she was misguiding me and I told her I will find out and put in a complaint to the owner of the company. That kinda staff will take than bring business to Popeyes."}
{"text":"Rhythom is rocking at the door helping everyone!! This place is awesome every time!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a shrimp po boy and a 3 piece tender. I received and paid for a 3 piece dinner. This was the third time I'd been there and my order has been incorrect. I truly dont think the cashier knows her menu; as she always seems confused. I opted not to send the dinner back because I just didn't have the energy to go through the drama. Moving on, the po boy had brown lettuce....YUK! And the chicken was inedible, like someone poured a box of salt on it. This is a brand new location and I live around the corner. I've eaten Popeyes for decades....but I will not return to this one. Third time is a charm. Poor, poor management and it WILL affect your business, Popeyes. Step up your game!"}
{"text":"Went in a few weeks ago...I ordered drive threw. When I left I got home before realizing my gf didn't get all her food...(can't let a Prego gf be unhappy right) so I went back to ask for the small side of Mac n cheese we paid for..got there around 11 right after they closed the night manager tavius said they tree them out since they closed...I would have been fine if he hadn't practically screamed in my face..management staff is rude and not worth it...avoid this location if you expect any errors in your order to be corrected..."}
{"text":"This is the closest Popeye's I know of to me.  If I happen to be in the area I HAVE to stop in for the red beans and rice! If I knew how to make them like they do I would! I absolutely love them and as long as the biscuits are fresh and moist they go great with the beans and rice too.  The chicken is good as well but my favorite is the rice and beans!"}
{"text":"If you order chicken tenders, you should expect tenders NOT nuggets. We purchased two 5 piece meals and neither one had a tender...just small nugget looking pieces. Two day later I went to KFC and my tenders were perfect. It's now my go-to place for tenders. This Popeye's also needs someone at the register with a personality."}
{"text":"I hesitated to write this. I mean, everyone has a bad day, but in the end, my disgust and frustration won out. On 3/2 my son and I dined at this location. The young man at the counter - Alex - was super nice and friendly. Unfortunately, the rest of our visit was less than stellar. About half way through our meal, three kids (around age 11 or so) came in a got water cups from someone behind the counter. These kids spend over 10 minutes at the soda machine tasting every possible concoction of soft drink, rinsing their cups under the fountain, then wiping them out with napkins they left on the counter. I finally got up to say something to \"Tom\" the manager when one of the boy started washing under the water dispenser. Despite the boys being there over 10 minutes at this point, he claim he hadn't seen anything. His response to my complaint and concern - 1) \"No kids come behind the counter so it's ok.\" 2) \"I'm not their parents. We'll clean it up later.\" 

To Tom (and Popeye's) I say this - No, you are not therr parents. What you are is a manager our a facility that serves food to the public. You have a duty with that job to make sure the place is kept as clean as possible which includes asking people to leave if needed.

Our bill was just over $20. These 3 kids spend $0. Hope they come back with their parents to eat, because you won't be getting our business again. I have also filed a complaint with the Maricopa County Department of Environmental Services,"}
{"text":"OK,  I'll admit it's been a long time since I've been to Popeye's, and after today I doubt I'll ever set foot in one again.  8 dollars & 90 cents for 3 small pc.'s of chicken, a slaw & a biscuit?        Are you kidding me?  Where's the fries?   Mind you the chicken is good (and hot) & the biscuit is great, but for the amount of food you get, come on.  By the time we had reached College St., we decided we were still hungry, so ran down to the Taco Bell & popped 3 soft tacos.  Now, we were full, but for almost 9 bucks, Popeye's should've done that for us."}
{"text":"I love their food. But I won't go inside due to the poor cleanliness and bugs. So I opt for the drive thru and usually that works. But tonight was terrible. We pulled up and asked for a minute and then were asked a few seconds later if we were ready. Then a lady came onto the speaker and was so rude. So we decided real quick and she kept interrupting and getting the order wrong. When we finally got the order correct  we paid and they told us it would be 4 minutes. That was fine at least the food was ping to be fresh. They brought us our order and forgot our extra biscuits. When we went to go ask for them the same rude women handed them to us in a napkin. Although I love the food. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Great job on food preparation by the kitchen staff! Delicious and hot! Terrible execution  by customer facing team, including blue shirts! My Very simple order was lost in the shuffle. They could not even blame being busy as it was 2:45 on Sat afternoon and I was one of only 4 customers in the store at the time. 
Owners...take note and work to improve. Your revenue depends on it!"}
{"text":"This Popeye's was in fact, not the shiznit.
Food was okay, but employees seemed absent minded. Gentleman in front of me had to direct staff to correcr his order several times."}
{"text":"Deserves no stars. I arrived at 6:48 behind 2 others. First person didn't get his order taken for 8 minutes then the second person just got there order taken. Im now going on 14 minutes waiting to order. There is only 1 girl working drive through, the front, and packing orders. If Popeyes would like to refute this claim I suggest you check your security cameras...
The girl that finally took my order 16 minutes after I got behind 2 people who only ordered simple combo meals. She tells me that it's basically always like this. The manager who doesn't seem to care has been sitting in the dining area doing nothing the whole time. I will never be coming here again and I hate myself for waiting 16 minutes to order. Stay far away from this specific location. 
Took 35 minutes to finally get the food after walking in. They did provide me with a free unsolicited drink while I waited which was nice and extra piece of chicken they told me. The girl up front is extremely nice the whole time they are just severely understaffed"}
{"text":"Brought the family to eat here for the 2nd time since they opened up recently and the 1st time everyone was friendly and kiss ass cause it was grandopening weekend and all the big wigs were present. Fastforward to today 180° No welcome mat, employees in the back cursing talking about other customers and not to mention it looks like a gang festival with employees having tatoos on theyre face and rags hanging out theyre pockets. I love popeyes food but will neer visit this 1 again. They were out of alot of drinks and were out of almost all deserts at 7pm. Not to mention i got called BRO. Fix it quick popeyes or your gonna lose buis fast"}
{"text":"I ordered a tuesday special which includes 2 chickens and a side of onion rings.
i waited 10 minutes plus for my food, they said the reason it was taking awhile, was because they were frying my onion rings, later as i opened the bag their was only 5 onion rings..What?....

Service - Slow, i had to wait some time for my chicken they did not inform me that it would take longer then 10 minutes. Rude, because they pointed their finger at me to come and get my food. 

Food - Too greasy and oily"}
{"text":"I cant believe what I brought back to work today from popeyes, OMG, 11 tiny shrimp were about the size of a nickle, 1 biscuit & a side of mash potato's. For 7 dollars and change. What a FFF rip off. I have pics to show. but I don't see a place to add them.

I will not grab food here again...................................
DONT EAT HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a typical fast food disaster. My self and three friends hit the drive thru after a long day in the pool thinking it would be a good idea... Bad call on our part...

 Upon pulling in a heavily accented voice said \"Hold on\" and disappeared for over 5 minutes.. Once she finally returned it was very hard to communicate with the person on the other end of the speaker as she did not understand English hardly. We attempted to order 4 different basic meals. No substitutes, nothing special, just the meals and the drinks. We got to the window and waited another 5 minutes. Once we got the food we had to remind them of our drinks (one being sweet tea that was hot as if it just came out of the brew machine with no ice) and also had to get sauce/napkins/utensils. Once we got home and started opening up the food we discovered ALL 4 meals were wrong. We did not receive a receipt so we googled the location and called to complain. Upon speaking with the general manager she denied to credit or note our issue because we didn't have a receipt number. I had to get back in my car and take all of the food back inside to get it fixed. When I showed to the store the employee and manager both had attitude about fixing the order. 


Needless to say... Never again!"}
{"text":"They get a star because the workers are usually nice. Have gotten the wrong order from them 3 times now. Should have stopped on number 2. If you go in, make sure you check your order."}
{"text":"Excellent meal! Customer service was outstanding and friendly. The food was the best that I have had at a popeyes in a long time (and I am a popeyes regular!). I was very impressed for it being a relatively new location. Great job!"}
{"text":"I want to thank this young asian guy who help in the drive thru. For the first time in history there's actually a nice employee that got my order right and even offered me a drink!!! while I wait for my order at the parking lot."}
{"text":"Popeye's has long been my favourite fried chicken joint with the best chicken in town. The spicy crispy chicken, hot southern-style biscuits, cajun gravy mashed potatoes and juicy butterfly shrimps w/ tar tar sauce are all DELISH! The service can sometimes be really slow and other times it can be fast but I've been here several times and usually always have to wait for my meal to be packed up. The food is good enough to bring me back, but only when I have 15 minutes to kill waiting."}
{"text":"Hot fresh food everyone I visit. Always clean. Staff is nice. Only problem is they are currently  understaffed so the wait time might vary"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I like the food and the staff are friendly.  However, I'm not very please with having to wait for over 30 minutes either drive thru or inside the restaurant for food.  Last time I was there, drive thru was a breeze but they got my order wrong.  I asked for 8 piece mild chicken and only dark meat but received 8 piece mixed chicken with 2 pieces that was very spicy.  That's ok as long as it doesn't happen all the time."}
{"text":"Hubby's favorite is now the chicken sandwich. I have to admit that the bun is tasty. He pointed out that the lettuce (not iceberg) and tomato (actually red, not pink) are fresh as well. 

I still like my spicy strips, red beans and rice, and biscuit. Evil, but yummy!"}
{"text":"Went to the drive though and was told to wait in my car. Apparently, they forgot i was waiting in my car. I had to go inside to get my food. Did not have any honey."}
{"text":"Consistently terrible customer service, consistently \"out\" of menu items, consistently long wait times. Employees are rude, avoidant, unfriendly, and act like customers are a nuisance. Nobody seems to know what they're doing, nor do they care. If you visit this location, prepare to leave disappointed; either you were treated like a subhuman by a fast-food worker with a chip on their shoulder, or you had to leave without the food you came for, or both. As someone who works in customer service every day, this location is completely demoralizing. I don't know how they're still in business."}
{"text":"I recently went back a couple of times out of convenience.  The chicken is ok.  Shrimp is ok.  The fries and cat fish were pretty good.  The biscuits had good flavour but were a little denser than I like. 

According to my receipt, I ordered at 2:36.  I was asked to pull forward, no problem but annoying.  at 2:56 I finally went in to get my money back.  One cashier told me it had only been 10 minutes not 20 so I showed her the time on  the receipt.  She just walked away.  

Another asked the manager if she could give me my money back AND the food which had apparently been sitting on the counter for who knows how long.  The manager said no to the food but did, grudgingly from the look on his face, return my money.  I had already told the cashier I didn't want the food anymore anyway.

Bottom line, I have had their chicken at other locations and it was good.  I will not be returning to this location.  One cashier seemed customer oriented, one was rude after being caught in a lie, and the manager didn't even talk to me.  No, I'm sorry.  Nothing.  He got the money, handed it to the cashier who handed it to me.

With management like that, this place is doomed."}
{"text":"It's okay i guess...just typical fast food. I got the ghost pepper wings and they weren't even close to how spicy they were advertised as. I also got the chicken tenders and I received 5 small shrivelled pieces of chicken. The breading was peeling off a bit too-definitely undercooked. But to top off my not-so-great experience was the LOUD as HECK music and the amount of crowding in that place. You have to wait almost 15 mins in line. They don't pick up their phone either-i had to call 9 times for them to even pick up."}
{"text":"This Popeyes is the WORST one that I have been to twice & both times I left with NOTHING! They move so slow I came through the drive thru for the 2nd time with a car behind me right before closing & they took forever with the cars in front of me that by the time I got up to order it was 11 (the closing time ) but I figured I still could order because they are the ones took long & I was there before the time but no after waiting 15 min they yell out the door \"were closed\" & turns off the lights I was stuck trying to get out cause I was already in there with a car in there behind me smfh!!!! I will NEVER go back very poor customer service!!"}
{"text":"I too am joining the list of customers who got their order messed up.  NOT ONCE, NOT TWICE, but THREE TIMES!!!!  I have tried, but well work the drive to Cane's and Chick-Fi-A.  Rude, always someone different working there.  One time, the manager I believe,  was taking orders at the counter, you stood and waited while she took care of one customer at a time.  Poor, Poor service.

I could not eat the tenders I received today, after a mix up and charging me too much.  They were old, and too hard to bite into.  

Then tried to leave a review on their web-site and it would not take it either."}
{"text":"Looked up this location times and it said 11pm. Went through the drive through at 10:15pm and they had an automated system saying they were closed. Not cool."}
{"text":"30 minute wait on a take out order. Servers were not capable of following through with orders properly. Management team needs to step up their game and do a better job."}
{"text":"We have not been here for a few years, and did not remember why.  My wife and I decided to try again, looking for the Hushpuppy shrimp.

Plenty of people eating inside for a Tuesday night.  (Good sign).  Service was good.  Clerk somewhat confused but no more than any other fast food chain with young kids running the register.

Ordered the seafood combo and the Shrimp special.  $15 total.

Way overpriced for the amount of food received.  Three small pieces of overly breaded fish & Mac/cheese.  Honestly I left still hungry.

I believe last time we were here I ordered the family chicken combo at $22.

Food is good but overpriced."}
{"text":"Wanted to try some spicy chicken and I was every disappointed. The place was clean but the food was nothing to come back for. We got the 8 piece family meal with the biscuits and mash potatoes and an large mac and cheese.  I taste no spices or flavor in that chicken. You really don't get your money's worth and I will NOT be back.  We even had 2 pieces of chicken left and did not bring it home. That says it all!!!"}
{"text":"Poor service at this location, no receipt given, fries ate cold amd overcooked, and the cashier gave the wrong changes all the time, don't trust them, always always ask for receipts. They will not give dipping sauce unless asked, sometimes they charge more than they should. good location though."}
{"text":"I prefer Popeyes any day compare to KFC.  The crispness of the chicke  is perfect , the coleslaw is good the red bean rice was nice . On the other side try my sis wanted to try the shrimp , order they new  hush shrimp , not wat  was expected , very small pieces and nothing too good about it . Don't come for shrimp to this place ."}
{"text":"I don't expect much from fast food places but this one disappoints me still. I love the cajun flavors of Popeyes so when they have a price special I tend to go. This location is not well kept. The tables and floor are oily and covered in crumbs. The service is slow and far less than friendly. There's a 50/50 chance that the food will be hot and fresh. The person who appeared to be the manager sat and talked on her cell phone in the dining area while the place was a mess. If you go, just don't expect much."}
{"text":"12/17/15 it was awful. Cold an dc dry chicken strips. Coleslaw is not tasty canes hays the beat."}
{"text":"The worst popeyes experience ever. Left over chicken and stale. Worst poutine, everything was cold."}
{"text":"How do I start?  Let's start with a quotation or two.  One that comes to mind is \"it takes an eternity to get a customer but only 2 seconds to lose one\". This is exactly what happened at 7:10 pm on Jan 27.  Marvic and the cook took the liberty to yell at the top of those lungs that they do not honor typical Popeyes coupons that are advertised as specials. I remind you - this is on their website and coupons that state this it is valid only at this location. I at least give Marvic credit for \"checking up\" on possible acceptance but the cool came running out in his green apron to yell with confidence that \"we don't accept those coupons - I don't care what the website says\". I asked him if he even knew what they website said and he said yes. Yet he could not reiterate word by word but his hubris won't even let him look. Very bad service. And it's like my second grade teacher who once said \" it only takes one bad apple to ruin it for the rest of the bunch\". Well, Marvic, I will not only boycott your location but all popeyes locations. I cater a lot and now the other franchisees lost out. You probably don't care as you proudly told me \"I'm an independent franchisee...\" .  Loud and clear El Capitan!  One last quote \"the customer is always right!\""}
{"text":"I went to the drive thru as I approached the window, the gentleman just looked at me like he was bewildered.  No greeting or nothing he then proceed to ask what my order was.  I told him it was the 10pc chicken only half spicy and half regular.  When I received the chicken, there is usually a white paper indicating which is spicy and regular, it wasn't  there.  Felt this over all service needed to be known.  I called the store and told Kyle the manager about it. He was very good and assisted me with the situation.  Sort lacks customer service!  But kyle made me want to come back"}
{"text":"Just bought a 16 piece family meal I ordered 3 mash potatoes and cole slaw. When we get home we realize they only gave us 1 order of mashed potatoes and a box of fries. If you didn't have everything we ordered then you should have let us know that rather than just giving us whatever you had on hand. Then I call the restaurant twice to inform them of the issue and the phone just rings. After waiting over 10 mins for my food this is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service from Rhythm and the atmosphere was clean and inviting.  Would highly recommend when your in the mood for some chicken"}
{"text":"Friendly service and perfect touch of chicken, not too dry or too well done, juicy n moist.  I always eat Popeyes statewide, this one has the best chicken so far!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch today and had a fantastic experience! We were greeted when we walked through the door, advised as to what would be the best deal for what we were looking for, and treated like kings! (That means while we waited we got a free biscuit!) The two employees working the front were working as a team so in sync with each other that it was flawless! Our food was fresh, hot and delicious! Thank you Popeye's!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Walk-in pickup for a meal had the order wrong. Chicken not fresh and 10 pcs of chicken wrongly split between spicy/mild. More spicy pcs then requested even after the cashier writing it down. They only gave me thighs and drumsticks at late lunch time. Chicken pcs were the size of a closed babies fists. I'm not even exaggerating. Don't believe? go check it out yourselves. The only thing decent was the FREE 3 pc strip you get from raptors app. Looks like this place is trying to cut cost at the cost of losing my business."}
{"text":"Had mixed quality results here. Bad popcorn shrimp once. My dog couldn't even chew it. Last time the chicken was old and dry. Doubt I will try again"}
{"text":"The absolute WORST Customer Service I have experienced this year so far,  and I rarely eat popeyes,  but I would never visit this location again!"}
{"text":"This is the best Popeyes in Charlotte. I've lived in a few different states and I've always had the LUXURY of having Popeyes close by. When I moved here found out it was only like four in the whole Charlotte area. And I've been too all four, hands down this is the best! Chicken was fresh, fish was fresh , shrimp fresh... fries fresh! And delicious!! They even give you extra Cajun Seasoning!!! (If you haven't tried it AMAZING) \"I put that Shhhh on Everything!!\" Lol literally I save the extra packets for other meals... lol but anyways thank me later! Lol hands down this Popeyes is the best one I've had clean & friendly also! I'm sure Annie from the Popeyes commercial would say \"Honeyyy this is the best Popeyes in town! Make sure you try my back for limited time five dollar big box!\""}
{"text":"Tonight was my 2nd or 3rd time at this location. Its part of a Texaco gas station and has a drive thru. I ordered at the counter because I needed gas anyway. Tuesday night is their 99 cent leg and thigh special so I got one of those. I also saw a sign for a 2 pc mixed and a biscuit for 2.49. I asked what the pieces were for that combo and the cashier told me Breast and wing, so I ordered one as well. Well I got home and had 2 legs and 2 thighs in my bag along with a biscuit.  Did some quick math, and 2 of the 99 cent specials + 89 cents for a biscuit would of only set me back 2.87 instead of the 3.48 I was charged for the same thing.  

Anyway, the chicken was pretty greasy. I've had better from the SW location near where I moved from. I will probably return at some point because it's right across the street from where I work and it's an easy stop otw home without going out of my way at all. They have good prices and a special everyday, so it's fairly economical."}
{"text":"This restaurant is consistently slow.  It seems like the kitchen is very chaotic and disorganized.   The staff doesn't really seem to care too much about guests or doing their jobs well.  The food is usually a mixture of some dishes hot and some very cold.  With the long wait times for food, I would still be reasonably happy if all the food was hot and fresh.   But it is not."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible food, the chicken was dried up and very old, the Cajun rice is nothing but mush.  Al Copeland is probably turning over in his grave seeing what his empire has become.  Shame on you for allowing old dried up chicken to be served to your customers.  I hope the Heath Department comes in and gives you guys a surprise visit!"}
{"text":"Well, its Popeye's is why it gets its 3 stars but this location is obviously operating from a monopolist mindset with slow service and the highest menu prices in town. No communication regarding being out of mild chicken while waiting patiently in the drivethru, but they did upgrade a piece to a breast no charge. The high school kids manning the store seem friendly enough but seem more focused on the never ending free soda dealie. I can get a 6 piece 2 side 2 biscuit for $6.99 for printing out a coupon at the other location, I guess it'll probably be my last visit. Given how long they expect you to wait in the drive-thru they should take reservations, who do they think they are Farmer Boy's?"}
{"text":"I'll second the friendly staff comment, between that and actually running the specials its the only game in this part of town. I don't even know why I bothered to try out KFC's day old 5 thighs at the centennial location, Popeye's is a MUCH MUCH better deal, quality and value wise"}
{"text":"Paid extra for white meat and was given 2 wings...not worth it..... Not the cleanest restaurant... They did not have coke available and the fountain pop they did have was flat... They need to recalibrate the pop and co2 mix ... I feel it was not worth the money I spent!!!"}
{"text":"I know this is a high rating for a fast food chain, but I really like popeyes! I wish they are closer to my work place or where I live. Of course we go there for their fried chicken. They are by far the best, although I have heard of a place that recently open near West Towne that might give them a bang for their buck. 

Being a typical fast food joint, the service you'd expect is also typical of fast food joints. All those times we were there I'd had friendly polite service. I was pretty lucky for that. We like our fried chicken spicy. We love the crispy breaded skin, and the juicy chicken, which is also tender and flavorful. I love popeyes fried chicken! 

We haven't had much luck with their sides though. Their fries and mashed potatoes are ok but we don't usually order anything else after our first try. Their pricing for the regular menu is set high for fast food chains. Good thing is they almost always have one or more specials, we always go for that. You get so much more for your money that way =)

And now I don't believe I just raved about fast food and fried chicken =)"}
{"text":"Ridiculously slow delivery. Was told as soon as possible... 2 hrs later the food arrived."}
{"text":"Chicken is over cooked. Super salty. Can probably eat them if you're drunk enough.
Worst Popeyes fast food restaurant ever!"}
{"text":"I ordered 10 pieces for $11.99 from drive thru. It took about 5 minutes with 3 cars in front of me. This place is by convenience store in chevron gas station. The chicken was big, good taste and still hot when I got home (7 minutes later). I have to say there were some days in the past that I got saugy ones."}
{"text":"The food here taste decent but my god the workers are so slow. I don't mind waiting forever for my food if they are making it fresh (there was a bunch of cooked chicken ready). But all the employees in the back were moving at a snails pace, with no courtesy on getting their customers their food fast.. Since it is fast food after all. BTW no Tuesday special"}
{"text":"First off, let's this out of the way. Popeye's is not your healthy alternative lifestyle choice. Popeye's is Louisiana style breaded chicken cooked through a frying process. That being said. It is quite delicious. I usually go in for the weekly deals on Sunday because I get to pick a small sandwich. The meat is usually great and has a wonderful taste between sin and guilt.  The biscuits were what initially drew me to this place so those are consistently well-made. The sides are however a hit and miss with coleslaw being chopped too thick at times, the macaroni being so-so, and the fries feeling dry (very rare though) . Overall though, I find the service is quite speedy at this location and the decor is more creative than some of the other locations."}
{"text":"I will have to say that this is the worst Popeye's that I have ever been to. And I have been to plenty. No matter what time of day I go, the chicken is never fresh. It always looks dry, like it has been sitting out all day, and it tastes like old grease. Well, I went today, trying to give it another chance, and not only was the chicken thigh that they gave me not fresh, it was the smallest freaking thigh ever!!! Like it came from a baby chicken!!! I have tried to give it a few chances but it has disappointed me every time."}
{"text":"Beware here. I got a 3 pcs combo and one of them was STINKY!!!! It is so bad..The first time had that issue from popeyes"}
{"text":"It is very rare that I have an experience that makes me write a public review, but this was one of them. I was excited to see Popeyes come to Gastonia, but always wondered why it seemed so dead. I know why now. First of all, I went tried to order the Mississippi Mud Cake. They said they were out. Same answer for the next three alternative desserts I tried to order. She then tells me all they have are blueberry and apple pies. So I order blueberry. I get to the window and she tells me they don't have blueberry so she just gave me two apple. Really queen? So out of 6 desserts on their menu, they had 1. She then gives me food and shuts the window. No thank you, no have a nice day. Nothing. If I weren't on my lunch break, she would probably be wearing the diet coke I ordered. But aha. It wasn't diet at all. My other food was good, but everything else was sh*t. I won't visit this Popeyes again. They need new management and potentially new employees that aren't jaded hoodrats."}
{"text":"We ordered a 16 piece meal with 3 large sides for a small party. They told us we would have to wait 15 minutes so we parked in the parking spot they asked us to move to. After 30 minutes a crew member came out and brought us a box of chicken tenders. We sent that back with our receipt because that was not our order. A gentleman came out with our receipt and asked if we had gotten our order and we said no and he walked away. After another 35 minutes I went inside to see if they had forgotten to give us food. The crew didn't believe that we had not gotten our food and one shorter gentleman insisted that he gave my boyfriend the bag of food. He began to loudly shout that he knew exactly what he gave and I said I didn't think he did and he began to even louder insist that he had given us our food. Someone came back to the front and asked me to write down my full name and number and I did. I felt very uncomfortable and verbally let them know that and went to my car to get my boyfriend. We got our order and left without a single person apologizing for any of the many things that went wrong. When we got home we didn't have a single biscuit. The food is amazing but it can only make up for so much of the staffs terrible attitudes. 1 star for the chicken but I'd give them less if I could."}
{"text":"I went to Popeyes today and I loved it.
Employees were friendly. The food was yummy. I got there $5 box."}
{"text":"Chicken is good but always check your order before  you leave. They messed up with my orders all the time when going drive tru."}
{"text":"Impressive customer service ..
My husband and I arrived at International McCarran Airport LV on Sat and ordered family meal 8pcs and popcorn chicken dinner. When we took off thinking we have all what we ordered.. we arrived at our Resort we were missing a popcorn chicken. Today our vacay is over  and back at the airport having brkfast at Wendys. I took a chance to talk to customer service at Popeyes just to see if they remembered me. Very helpful Marjorie (cashier) remembered me she said she was trying to catch me on Sat but I was already gone. No hesitations..  Marjorie and her Mgr was very kind and gladly provided me my popcorn chicken from Sat. Mabuhay ang mga filipina Marjorie and her Mgr parehong pinay 

Thank you Ladies!!"}
{"text":"Worst experience in this restaurant. 
All employees looked so inexperienced.
Couldn't handle the situation.
just don't go.
waited 40 minutes and couldn't get chicken."}
{"text":"Thank you Popeyes for coming back to CU!! First off I would like to say I always enjoy Popeyes spicy chicken. My first visit was good the staff was super polite and the spicy chicken was served so hot I had to wait for it to cool to eat it. That's not something you'll see at KFC. Anyway I will be back. Welcome back Popeyes!!! Let's hope you put KFC out of business in CU."}
{"text":"Yikes! This new Popeyes is off to a rocky start. I had the misfortune of encountering (Shaniece...girl with purple hair strand) at the drive thru today. She was too dang RUDE to be interacting with customers! She needs to be far, far, away from customers, with her crappy people skills. Also, prices are way too high here. Either that, or they made a mistake on ringing up my order. The 2 piece combo for $7 plus tax is basically a one piece combo because the wing piece is so tiny. 

Check your receipt and contents of your order before you drive away. She also forgot napkins, fork, and straw with the order. 

I'll never come back to this location. :("}
{"text":"This was the Popeyes location that I finally got my wife to try. Befpre this, it was never an option since we have yet to see a nice, clean location. This location seems, to us anyway, to stay pretty well clean and orderly. Pretty much all the bad reviews have to do with service and not so much the food. I couldn't agree more. We keep coming back because we have had good luck every time we've gone. I would rather have Popeyes over KFC any day of the week. The biscuits are something to write home about. We always order the tenders and have never been disappointed. At this point, we have no reason to stop using this location."}
{"text":"I just went to get lunch on my break period for work and when I was given the food they put my French fries just in a bag with no box or anything and I don't think that was very nice. Also I asked for spicy chicken tenders and they gave me regular, I'm very upset because it's not like I had a lot of time to go back and get it fixed because I only have 30 minutes for lunch. Also the gentleman at the window was very rude and as I was trying to put my drinks away he gave me the dirtiest look because he was having to wait and hold my change. I'm very upset, never had such a bad experience until today. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Noon on a Wednesday I stopped here to get my kids and chicken for lunch. There was nobody in line and we went through the drive thru. I had to repeat myself at least 5 times order two of the 9 pc's. The girl was not listening or an able to hear I'm not sure. 

I got to the window and it was $9 and I told her I wanted 2 sauces for each and that we had never been there before and we're excited to try it. She said she could give me one of each and charge me 25 cent for additional sauce. I told her we wanted one barbecue and one ranch and I'll pay for a mustard so I can see what it was like. 

She gave us two ranch, I went back (literally backed up) for a BBQ and a mustard!  Crunchy dry garbage or greasy pieces, and all were lacking flavor. $9.00 is not worth it. I am upset that they are in business! She was put out that I asked for the correct sauces. And absolutely nobody was smiling inside the establishment. My 9 year old asked \"why does everybody looks so gloomy in that store?\" Avoid like the plague. Really disappointing after coming back from the south where they have GOOD chicken. 

The sign said \"Chicken and biscuit\" and there were no BISCUITS even available!"}
{"text":"I give this a 2 star review because I come in and it takes them 20 min to get me my food. The lady at the register charged me for dipping sauce even though I ordered a combo. The service is very slow and you can't understand anyone who works here."}
{"text":"I love Popeye's I hate THIS Popeye's! Every time I come here I wait forever for my food, and it's still cold or luke warm. The service is terrible. Their soda machine has never had all of the sodas. I've been here 3 times, each time there are 6-7  employees hanging out in the lobby. Please close this location until you get better employees, food, and service!"}
{"text":"Ok, I feel the need to write something since at the time of this review this Popeye's has only 2 stars overall.  The first time we went (about a month after it opened), it was a complete cluster- long wait times, missing items, angry patrons, messy restaurant, etc.  Luckily, the food was delicious!  So after my wife and I finished complaining about the complete lack of organization that the staff appeared to have, we decided since the food was so tasty (juicy chicken, yummy-slightly-spicy potatoes, nice biscuits), we'd give it another chance.  

The next time (about a month later), food was still delicious (fyi-blackened chicken is a tasty, fresh, healthier alternative too) and the service was much more organized.  Staff is always friendly, though you can tell a manager or two micromanage a bit too much and it leads to employees that sometimes won't make decisions for themselves.  

Tastier than KFC by far.  Needs some music!"}
{"text":"Food was fine it's the staff that was terrible. Rude to me and my husband. They were talking about us to each other right in front of us. Really terrible service"}
{"text":"Went to Popeyes the other day the chicken was disgusting I bit down on my mild chicken tender and I bit a giant piece of chicken fat! It was disgusting! And not to mention there was an ant crawling on my friends shoulder then when she turned around there were several ants crawling right behind her!  Customer service wasn't too good either. Overall experience was bad. Bad food, dirty restaurant, and sub par customer service"}
{"text":"Every time I decide to eat at the location on Maryland Parkway they forget something in my order; French fries, chicken strips, and now my biscuit. Service is embarrassing as the associates throw gang signs out the drive through window and find time to do everything else, but get my order correct. Would not recommend going to this location, ever. If I could rate it 0/5 stars I would."}
{"text":"Table is not clean, staffs unfriendly, smell washroom, overcooked foods, and manager plus employees dont care about what customers complaints are.
DONT GO THERE!"}
{"text":"I would not eat here again...
Ordered catfish platter for 10$
I looked like a kids meal...
Went to talk to the manager on duty
4/14/16 2:45 in the afternoon. 
She was unconcerned with dissatisfaction and lost a lifelong customer today:("}
{"text":"The staff is for sure very friendly, though not very experienced I think. Food is pretty good for fast food. Price is fair too. I want to like this place more, but I just wish there was adult, experienced supervision all the time. I still give this place a good review!"}
{"text":"Don't go here. I waited 45 minutes in drive through for my food. The staff gave zero explanation or apologies for the wait time."}
{"text":"Although I remind myself that this is only fast food and is not worth becoming upset, there seems to be a lack of leadership at this location.  I ordered my food at 7:10 ( time on receipt) and waited until 7:39 ( 2 piece order with a side of shrimp).  There were a lot of people behind the counter, but noone to notice huge mass of people waiting,  and not even on person apologized for the wait...only A server who smirked when I asked for ice because the machine was not working and drinks were running out.  And ...my order was completely wrong....but I ate it because I could not wait longer.  Food was not bad....but there just did not appear to be  anyone there who cared.  Thus, I will not return or use them again for corporate party.  I hope this business succeeds."}
{"text":"I like Popeyes...but this location sucks! Staff not all that friendly, and they have screwed my order up twice.  So, since I was nearby and it was Tuesday, Tuesday special 1.49, up from .99 cents not long ago, I decided to give them another shot. I was there early around 230...not busy...ordered 4 orders of the special, that would be 8 pieces of chicken.  Order comes up..I go home...open the bag and only 4 pieces of chicken.  ARE YOU FUKEN KIDDING ME!!  Again they screw up my order....HOW DOES THIS LOCATION CONTINUE TO BE SO INCOMPETENT!!!?????  And these are the employees that want $15 an hour.....to screw up an order and basically steal my money.  I didn't go back as it is too far and not worth my time or gas....so this is my rant.  I'm sure I wont hear from anyone from popeyes as they probably don't read these because they dont care.   NEVER AGAIN AT THIS LOCATION...NEVER!!"}
{"text":"Went to get the Tuesday special, leg and a breast or whatever it is.  Of course since it's a new place it went up .20 to $1.49......of course we all know it used to be 
.99! I don't know where you find your employees but you need to try harder.  One was pretty good for your standards though.  But this other young Hispanic kid should never deal with the public.  I checked my order before leaving, it has been wrong the last two times, I ordered 3 specials and a regular side of mashed potatoes with the gravy on the side.  I open the box and he says \"6 pieces bro\" closes the box and puts it in a bag and turns his back and continues working.  First of all, bro? I'm not his brother I'm a guest/customer.  Second to just turn your back, no \"thank you\", \"come back\", \"have a nice day\". As for the mashed potatoes, the cup was half full, wasn't even enough for one person.  This location just gets worse n worse.  I know I won't hear anything from anybody, and don't expect to because nobody in management reads these.  If you did these problems wouldn't STILL BE PROBLEMS.  I wish Yelp would allow a \"zero stars\""}
{"text":"No Tuesday special.  No need to go back.  Didn't even order when I found out.  I can go to Sahara/Jones or Rainbow/215 and get a POPEYES Tuesday special.  This place sucks!  NEVER BE BACK!!!!  And I'll bet corporate or any manager doesn't even read these.  If you do I challenge you to respond"}
{"text":"I went here two times and got food poisoning two times. I ordered the crawfish both times. Maybe its what I ordered, maybe it was a fluke... or maybe its the restaurant. I don't know, whatever it is I will not be going back and do not recommend others do."}
{"text":"Just got home from drive thru with 12 pic meal and they forgot my biscuits. What? The telephone number is always busy can't get through. What? Learn how to read the order ticket and bag orders correctly. Hello? Is that really hard to do? To freaking tired to drive all way back for my biscuits I paid for.... Whatever."}
{"text":"Disappointed - even though I repeated my order 3 times, it was delivered incorrectly. Sides too small for the price. Chicken was over cooked and dry. Over ran by large staff: confusion and disorganization."}
{"text":"Overall the food wasn't bad. The young man who waited on us seemed annoyed to be there and very uninterested in taking anyone's orders. Waited at least 10 minutes to get food after placing order. Ok, enough good stuff, let's talk about the bad. Fountain drink area was a mess, tables were sticky and gross, floor was just plain nasty, and there appeared to be no organization or leadership in the kitchen. Location is good, however the parking lot is difficult to maneuver and you have to cross through the drive thru to get inside. At least the chicken was decent."}
{"text":"Food was good. The gentleman and young lady helping us was very nice. We tried calling in for pick up but they refused to do an over the phone order and that was ok. When we were waiting for our food the woman doing the drive thru orders was VERY rude. She would make rude comments about us trying to call our order in and wouldn't stop. It took everything in me to not come unglued. I will NEVER go to that place again. She should loose her job."}
{"text":"Terrible attitude! Drive through order four chicken and saw the price's not right. Double checked by the window And they only got three. It's a just a small misunderstanding could be quickly fixed by putting one more in the box! But I heard a loud response from a guy 'oh, want four now?!' with some weird tone! Hey we can hear you buddy and watch ur attitude! It's your job and you can't be bothered to do that?!!!! Full star for the chicken, and a big thumb down for THAT STAFF!"}
{"text":"The staff is consistently rude and my orders are regularly wrong. Keep in mind I order for 5-6 people each time I come adding up to around $55.00 an order. We come about once a week. Last night's episode was the last straw. That being said..you know I either love the food or I'm a glutton for punishment. :) 

@Amin Bhanani,

I believe you are the owner of the 1299 N. Arizona Ave location. If you could get your leadership squared away in this establishment this place would be awesome. Meanwhile your staff is losing money for you my friend.
Hope things change, my kids like their dad love some Popeyes!"}
{"text":"Good clean store. Good food as always at Popeyes. Great location. It always seems like there's a fast food place like this right next to a Gym. I guess that's the universe's way of balancing things out. My only complaint is the corny Mardi Gra music they play."}
{"text":"Absolutely pathetic service! 

WTH is wrong with this chain? They all suck so bad  and continually set the low standard for fast food  service and consistency."}
{"text":"Bathroom was nasty. Water didnt work to wash hands. Girl at the register shorted me on my food as well. Asked if I wanted spicy and still gave me mild.SMH"}
{"text":"If you consistently want to get the wrong order through the drive-through (have never eaten inside so hopefully that is better) and get sweet tea every time, even after repeating unsweetened and no sugar multiple times, along with the wrong sides or wrong food almost every time, this is the place for you.

I have kept coming here because my family likes Popeyes and put up with it since it was a new store.  Unfortunately months later they are still getting our order wrong every time and my wife and I have had to drive back multiple times to get our order corrected, or just eat the wrong food since it is a half an hour round-trip to get our food exchanged.  

I think tonight is the last night I'm going to put up with this and will not be coming back no matter how much my family likes Popeyes.

This place either needs better training, better management or I honestly can't see how anyone will keep coming here."}
{"text":"Quick and easy, grabbing a late meal after work.
Employees are always nice, love the food!"}
{"text":"The manager Tony is a absolute d bag. I ordered two chicken wraps and while I waited I had other people call me and ask for chicken. I got to the window and told him I'd come in and add to the order and it was as if I asked him for his own job. I came in and got a 8 piece meal. He looked at me twice and gave me a crappy look. Not the way I'd want my business ran. Tony is a bad employee and I'll never. Ring my money to this establishment."}
{"text":"Chicken served hot and fresh at 8:30 am! This is great. Everyone serving breakfast sandwiches. Travelers on different time zones like a variety of foods. Area appeared clean. Servers were friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Bad fucking service 1 car in front of me in the drive thru I waited 30 mins. if the persons order In front of me is going to take a while make that fucking person pull to the side and wait what the fuck 30 mins wait time for an order of 9pcs of chicken this fucking place is ridiculous the manager on this shift is an idiot."}
{"text":"I have been driving past the store for the past week and I thought Popeye's sounded good.  And in theory it was a good idea...lol.  This place shares a store front with a Chevron gas station.  I went up to the counter and placed my order.  The girl took my order without a problem and I went to find a seat.  There are about 7 tables.  I looked at two of them and they were dirty.  The third table I found appeared clean so I claimed it. My order was ready quickly and the chicken was fresh and hot.  The biscuit was flat and dry.  

The Popeye's restaurant shares a drink fountain with the convenience store.  The area where you stand to get your soda was filthy.  The floor needed to be mopped.   The floor in the resturant area was also dirty with wet spots of soda spilled on the floor and a trail or something that I am guessing came from dragging a trash bag across the floor.

When I was done eating I took my tray to the front to dump the trash into the trashcan but I could barely open the door to the trashcan.  It was stuffed full even though there were only three trays sitting on top of the tashcan.  I needed to use the bathroom but I figured it would be in the same state or worse than what I had seen so I decided to wait. 

There are other Popeye's in town that I think you could get better service from and have a cleaner dining experience.  Overall I would try and avoid this place if possible and find somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"Seriously and sadly disappointed. 

Normally, we love going to Popeyes, but sadly, something's always missing. This time was the last straw.  

Tonight we ordered two sweet teas in our combos and a jug of sweet tea in the drive thru. We went all the way home 20 minutes away to find that both sweet teas were not sweetened AND the jug of sweet tea wasn't even sweetened AND the jug of \"sweet\" tea expired today. THE DAY WE BOUGHT IT. so there's no way to save that for later. We were also pretty pissed that our Rip N' Chicken meals did NOT come with sauce. In fact, they didn't even ask for any sauce. We just assumed that it just came with the habanero ranch sauce it was advertised with. No napkins. No forks. No honey. No butter. 

We are pissed. 

My boyfriend and I drove all the way back to Popeyes to get our damn sweet tea. We love it and that's what we paid for, so we had to go back for it. They gave us new drinks and a new jug of \"sweet\" tea. When we got back to the car in the parking lot, we checked our drinks. And.... ONCE AGAIN they did NOT give us a jug of sweet tea. So we went back in a second time, the manager apologized and gave us a real actual jug of sweet tea. For our troubles, they gave us two awesome raspberry cream cheese pies and sauces. Thankfully they corrected most of the situation but we were just so disappointed that this has to happen to us every time we go to Popeyes. 

The food was great but the terrible service outweighed the pros. SHOUT OUT TO CANES FOR THE BEST DAMN SWEET TEA WHO GETS IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME."}
{"text":"I tried to give this location a zero, but I don't know if yelp will let me? 
Either way, Popeyes on Elliot and Priest in Tempe was the worst dining experience I have ever had... Ever!
I walked in with my wife and instantly the cashier was ogling her like she was a piece of meat. Then while we were ordering, the young man kept trying to up-sell us like we were in need of an extra 5lbs of lard at noon while our car was being serviced. We stuck with splitting a number 6 with nothing extra. When he rang us up I noticed the price was about 5 bucks too high. I tried to tell the young man, but he was in his own world. I tried again, but my wife said \"let's just look at the receipt\". We got to our table and sure enough, he took the liberty of charging us for some shrimp shit too. Maybe he was planning on having it as a snack in the back on our dime. 
I went back and asked for money back, and the kid had the nerve to argue with me. His manager even came over to back me up because she saw the whole thing. I told him that I tried to tell him before my card cleared, but he wouldn't listen. His excuse was that, \"he thought I was talking to 'my girl'\". I finally got my money back. He was still making excuses! All I said was, \"maybe you should stop talking and start listening\". He probably would have hit me if there were less people watching. Either way, steer clear of this  Popeyes! 
Lastly, if you want to feel like you're in a pre-emancipation proclamation, cotton field like, yessum, big lippin' environment, this may be your place to go! Just don't expect the employees to act like servants of any sort! They just look the part."}
{"text":"This is how halal fried chicken should taste like ! Its like KFC with desi spicy coating ... any day anytime ..."}
{"text":"If only I can give a negative rating. Just got out of the place after the worst customer service. Waiting 15-20 mins for their daily special. You would think that with a daily special they would have it ready. Another reasons that was upsetting was a gentlemen the came in after order 10 after a mine was in and got his food before. Their reasons was because she order from her cash register. Does that even make sense!?!? Anyways would not go back. And this is why some people will forever be working there. So incompetent even with the simplest task."}
{"text":"Service at this location is TERRIBLE! The kid behind the counter just stares at you, no greeting, talks very low to barely hear him, the tables are gross and seem like they are never cleaned off and the service is super slow even though there are a ton of people behind the counter. I will never return to this location."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve my one star..chicken is tasteless, the rudest customer service i have ever come across and my order is never correct; everytime i reach home something is missing..and the managers at this south blvd location are all useless..they prefer to argue with customers..i wouldn't waste my money here..never going back and neither should you!"}
{"text":"Big Popeyes fan. I frequent the one on Broadway between Mill and Priest near my work. Delicious food excellent service. This Popeyes near my house terrible. Made me never want to eat Popeyes again. Chicken was like rubber. Made both my girlfriend and myself sick. Employees have no idea what's going on. To top it all off they give you 1 tiny little sauce per meal and want 30 cents for any extra. The one on Broadway never charges for extra sauce. Guess I will only go to that one from now on. I do not recommend going to this one if it's your first time trying Popeyes you probably won't ever want to go back. Very dissappointed."}
{"text":"If I could give it a zero, I would! Was in the drive thru and was asked nicely to pull up. We waited about 10-15 mins and then the manager comes out and says the cook gave our food to someone else. He says that he will give us something extra for our wait, so we thought that was fair. So 15 mins more pass and he finally gives us our food. It was late and we were exausted so as soon as we got the bag we left and went home. We get home and we are missing our 2 Large sides and biscuits. The 12 piece was cold and wasnt all spicy. Not to mention, the two chicken tender meals had freezing cold fries and luke warm chicken that wasnt even spicy like requested. Eventually we went back. It was 30 mins before closing time and they were closed up, locked doors and everything, eventually they remade fries and gave us our sides. I LOVE Popeyes! But this was the worst one I have ever been too. To be in such a popular location, I expected way better service. Wont be back to that one."}
{"text":"So, I ended up here at the Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, located at 6121 Vegas Drive after going to the location on Rancho.  They were busy.  On Tuesday, they run a .99 cent special which includes the leg and thigh pieces of chicken.  This is a Great Deal.  So here we are in line, waiting.  Despite the overwhelming crowd of customers, they are rockin.  The wait wasn't very long, for me maybe five minutes.  I ordered 3 specials, red beans and rice and green beans.  The food was hot, fresh and taste the same as always, just plain ol good.  

I didn't give them  4 or 5 stars for one reason.  Because they were so busy, they began skimping on the portion sizes, as my order of red beans and rice was about thee quarters of the way full.  Also, upon ordering the red beans and rice, we received mash potatoes and gravy, which I had to brave the masses at the front counter to trade in.  We also ordered the spicy chicken and received regular.  So in their rushed state, they made a couple of vital mistakes... Overall the food was awesome, and they where handling the rush pretty well.  I would say tighten up just a little.  Pay a little more attention to detail..."}
{"text":"I usually go through the drive thru this time I decided to eat inside thinking my food would be as quick as the drive thru I ordered and waited 20 minutes inside plus they erased my order on there screen I asked to talk to manager Britney she took my receipt and said would give me a discount for the wait and that she would give me my receipt back . I grabbed my food ate and she never brought my receipt back I go and ask her to give me my receipt she lost it had to print a new one . I'm giving this restaurant a 1 star"}
{"text":"Terrible experience, nasty food and the place could have used a little TLC. Smell of old grease serving size of chicken tenders was more like they had cut one to make the order of three. A chicken thigh made us wonder if maybe they were using quail instead of chicken. Cole slaw went back because it was slimy and they told us all their Cole slaw was slimy. Now isn't that a great thing to tell a customer. Biscuits small and cold and red beans and rice were like none I've ever eaten in Cajun country. The chicken thigh was supposed to be spicy but someone forgot to tell the cook that. Three small tenders and a biscuit $7.39, save your money it was not good."}
{"text":"THE WORST!! NEGATIVE RATING! This was the worst experience I have ever had with Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits. I love the food and recently moved to AZ, so I drove 15 miles out of my way to get some of their food. I arrived about 6:30PM on 18 May 2016. I went through the drive thru and placed my order. They said it would take an extra 5 minutes. After parking and waiting 40 minutes, I went inside and asked about my order. There were no customers inside and when I approached the counter, I received no greeting. A slow approaching greasy looking young man approached, said nothing and just nodded as if to say \"what?\". I informed him I had been waiting and asked how much longer it would be. He yelled around the corner to ask about my order, and then came the fire works! A young lady yelled back, \"we didn't make it! He is new Israel, and you are not helping us! You need to help us!\"  ( I guess a new person was being trained and the staff was too busy ) Israel then walked around the kitchen, and opened then leaned into the walk-in, grabbing some fish or chicken fingers by his hands and tossing it at the fryer. He never said a word to me--just walked around in a stuper like a zombie. He stood near the back behind the main food prep table barking out orders for more mashed, beans etc. I stood there for about another 5-6 minutes thinking my food was on its way. Then, unprofessional Israel approaches the counter slowly and tells me, \"they didn't make it yet, it will be another 5 minutes or you can have your money back\" It was unbelievable the lack of professionalism I witnessed. I asked for my money back, and 'Israel\" disappeared then returned with a finger smashed wad of bills and coins and plopped it on the counter, turned his back and walked away without saying a word. Fire these people!! I'm shocked to see all the negative ratings this location has!! This is pathetic service!! If I could give a negative rating, I would. This location is a disgrace to the Popeye's franchise! The staff is either on drugs, needs training, supervision, or all of the above based on what I witnessed. Do not give this location your money! They do not deserve to be in business!"}
{"text":"7/22 10:30pm tried to order fries as well as the car in front of me they said they ran out for the night and could not make them . 
That's definitely loosing out on money"}
{"text":"The worst chicken place ever.. Tony the manager is a idiot.. how can you be out of shrimp every time I stop here ? I sat at the table closest to where you place your order and every customer that orders gets told sorry we are out of that... what a joke this place is"}
{"text":"Great service and great chicken. The biscuits and Cajun rice are always my fav. The restaurant and the service is not bad."}
{"text":"Iv had countless bad experiences with the service, the cashier got frustrated when I accidentally said the wrong size 4 the nuggets and when she finally decided to tell me the different sizes (rudely of course) the rest of the employees jst laughed whispered and avoided eye contact.- the food isnt worth the disrespect"}
{"text":"This location is new and I've been a few times since they've opened.  Today I went for lunch & the food was very good! The chicken was juicy & my sides were cooked to perfection. Give them some time and they'll be the best Popeyes in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I should get sponsored by Popeyes for the amount of I have consumed in my lifetime thus far

However! Mary Browns has a slight lead at the moment

I guess its a sign that you go too often if they know what you're going to order, just a matter of spicy or mild today ha"}
{"text":"I love Popeyes chicken but the service here is consistently and painfully slow. We tried to avoid the long wait time and started ordering by phone for pick up 20 minutes later... both times, there was a sheepish look at the counter when we got there because they had forgotten to put the order through and we still waited the usual 10-15 minutes anyway."}
{"text":"Was just in a couple days ago, so not only is this location open but it has to be one of the best Popeyes I've ever been too! The dining room was exceptionally clean, fantastic customer service, and the food was so fresh!!! This location is worth the trip!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!! The manager is terrible I don't blame the workers! I've never been in such a crappie place!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm joining the list of customers who got their order messed up in this place.  My visit was my first time there, being attracted by the $5 big box promotion.  In addition I ordered one apple pie but was given (and charged for) two instead.  When I discovered that it was too late to change.

The food was OK, the size of the chicken pieces was on the small side but I don't think it is smaller than KFC.  The biscuit was better."}
{"text":"My first time at any Popeye's was really a great experience. The chicken is absolutely amazing, and at this particular store, the staff was incredibly friendly. The chicken was even crispy even the next day (my eyes were bigger then my stomach I suppose). 

It was just an all around great experience and I would recommend this to anyone looking for great fast food chicken!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!! Although I love the food, I will never go back to this location!!! All the employees moved they had nothing to do. I'd love to give the owner an earful :/"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. My friend and I were close to the area after being at the gym so we just wanted to stop in and get something fast. We both like chicken and hadn't tried Popeyes yet so we stopped in to try it. It was about 11 pm there was only one customer in they're besides us and after waiting for ten minutes they never got to us and got down our order. They were just kinda slothing around in the kitchen area making the other persons order and never took the time to get to us so we ended up just leaving not even having a chance to try the food."}
{"text":"If I'm eating fast food Popeye's is the place I would go for chicken... However this is the worst location by far. The staff is unfriendly..hard of hearing bad attitudes in general. I was standing in line a elderly lady asked for sauce for her chicken the young lady behind the counter replied that's only if you buy tenders you have chicken the lady walked away I felt bad for her. There is a sign on the door that states they are hiring I hope they get rid of all the current staff and start fresh."}
{"text":"Best Popeyes in Arizona. Their customer service is by far the best and they offer military discount."}
{"text":"Service was horrible here, this employees need classes on how to deal with customers.
Will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"Worst Popeyes ever. They close the store at 10 o'clock when they are supposed to close at 11 on weekends"}
{"text":"I was disappointed that this restaurant location does not participate in the $4.99 specials seen on commercials. A restaurant in the heart of one of Canada's biggest cities is not participating in a campaign that I see on my tv every 10 minutes? Very odd indeed. I was told that I had to pay almost a dollar extra to add a biscuit to my order. 

The gravy I ordered was half empty and I'm not sure why it was. 

The food is decent however the prices at Popeyes are making it largely unaffordable."}
{"text":"Popeye's is my favorite fried chicken chain, but not this location.
The chicken was dried out and greasy. Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"Went through the drive-through and was asked to pull up and park in the parking lot where someone was to bring me out my food.  Over 20 minutes later, waiting for a chicken breast (which you'd think they'd have plenty of on hand), I went into the restaurant and the manager acted like I was harassing her because I was complaining about waiting so long.  

Then, I called the Customer Service number and was told that someone would call me back - that was over 2 months ago.  I even filled out the survey on their website which asks if you want to be contacted and I gave all my contact information.  NO-ONE from Popeyes has ever bothered to contact me!!!

Popeyes doesn't care about its customers, so I wouldn't recommend going there.  Well, unless you have PLENTY of time to waste!"}
{"text":"I had the worst fast food experience of my life at this location, and I've been alive 50 years. I could not believe it even happened. Mediocre food, bad service, horrible Customer Service, and both washrooms were filthy and garbage bin was spilling food and paper products onto the floor, 5 people on duty, 3 in the office having a chat. Manager should get a big broom and sweep this dump clean."}
{"text":"Wanted to try out popeye's since i Love chick fil a and wanted a chicken sandwich, but this place dosent even compare. First, service is mediocre at best. Could tell the girl ringing me up didnt care about her job and would rather socialize with other coworkers. second, i got charged for something i didnt even order but i was refunded the difference. Finally the last and main reason this place only gets 1 star was there was a bone in my chicken biscuit sandwich. Because of this i will never go back to any other popeye's."}
{"text":"Drive tru is bad, they don't offer condiments they just hand you the food and close the window"}
{"text":"I ordered food thur the drive thur Saturday. Was so disgusted by what I brought home. I ordered a 12 piece meal, inside my bag, was another smaller used bag along with a busted pen in the large bag under my food. A piece of the chicken had some kind of long furry something on it! I never complain but it totally grossed me out! Along with this Yelp, I called the 1-800 number. The dirty bag inside my bag was bad enough!!!"}
{"text":"Food cold right from the start couldn't turn around because the intersection is f****** ridiculous and I quite honestly don't even want to eat my meal horrible I'm pissed off"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service is very slow, and not welcoming the majority of the time. 
It appears this location is closed again. 10/31/15"}
{"text":"This is the dirties restaurant I have ever been in. I almost fell down the stairs trying to find the washroom. Once I got downstairs, I there was urine on the floor and feces  on the wall and flies everywhere. Not only did I not use the washroom, but I complained to the Management and threw my meal in the garbage after being refused a refund. I expected a lot more from Popeyes."}

{"text":"this place always gets our order wrong....they give us spicy chicken 
  when we request mild..told manager repeatedly"}
{"text":"I like to go to Popeyes. I know they just opened but twice in the past few weeks I've gotten home and the order is wrong. First time it was a thigh instead of a breast. Today it was mild tenders instead of the spicy I ordered. Three weeks should be enough time to train new employees."}
{"text":"I went here Tuesday coz My boyfriend and I were craving for chicken.I don't know if the guy that took my order was new there ,I'm not sure.He's just taking forever and having a hard time to enter it on their register.I only ordered 8 drumsticks and 3 thighs of chicken.Then I'm like finally I can go home after 30 mins of staying there.Then when we're about to eat,I opened the box and still they got my order all wrong.Instead of giving me 8 drumsticks and 3 thighs they ended up giving me 4 drumsticks and the rest are thighs.It was just frustrating!"}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed Popeyes Chicken. And we were excited when a Popeye's open on Crismon Road. The staff is very friendly. the chicken however is much different then we experienced back East 17 years ago. The first night they opened the chicken was just great, but every other time after that the chicken has been very dry, like it's been sitting around for a while. On this last trip I asked them to keep the Cole slaw separate from the hot red beans and rice. Of course they failed to do that and they did not packaged the Red beans and rice correctly and when I received the bag it had spilled all over the inside. You better get your act together Popeye's or you're going to lose me."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru and the worker inside was rude from the beginning.. when we got to the window  Blanca seemed like she hated her job. To top it off after asking her for butter and honey she acted like we were putting her out.  She needs to find a job she likes if that's how she's going to treat people.. it's called hospitality and she needs to get some.... horrible service!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars at this location I would. Worst employees and customer service ever. Popeyes is one of my favorites and I rarely go because this is the only location near me."}
{"text":"People are nice. But every time I go there they mess up my order and I've been there a total of ten times. Each time the order was messed up. I ordered a #11 which is there shrimp and fish combo and instead they gave me shrimp and chicken which is not even a possible combo on there menu. I've been very disappointed with there service."}
{"text":"Probably the slowest Popeyes ever to exist! The employees there can't handle the few people that come in during lunch."}
{"text":"The service here was absolutely horrendous, I stopped in here for lunch today and it took me almost 25 minutes to even get my food. Like yeah maybe if I was ordering a bunch of food but I literally ordered a 3pc chicken tender meal. So their chicken was pretty much burnt to a crisp, their loaded Cajun fries were horrible they were like sitting in some soupy substance. All and all I'll never come back to this Popeyes."}
{"text":"I always have a pleasant experience here. The workers are very nice. I go inside and the facility is clean.  I wished all popeyes in town were nice...They greet you as you walk in and thats nice."}
{"text":"If you go threw the drive-thru, get ready for them to ask you to park and wait for your food in the parking lot with the other fleet of cars they have waiting already. And then, if your lucky, the cashier will bring you the correct order after guessing which car it goes to."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 pieces of chicken, tackle box combo and onion rings.  Everything came out piping hot.  Sounds good so far right?

Problem 1: Onion rings.  I've had Popeye's onion rings once in the last 6 months in Vaughn.  They were great, best fast food onion rings I've had.  These didn't look the same at all.  These went straight from \"too hot to eat\" to limp, completely skipping the crispy stage.  And the batter just wasn't right.  Unless Popeyes changed them recently, I would guess these are not from Popeyes.

Problem 2: They TRIED TO CHARGE FOR A REFILL.  My gf went for a refill and got a free one no issues.  I went up to a different lady and she told me it's $0.85.  Ok, slightly irregular for fast food in Canada, but maybe the GFC has finally gotten to Popeye's.  I offer to pay on my debit card.  And immediately, she said \"just forget about it.\"

Hmmmm.  VERY SUS.  It sure looks like she was just trying to scam some money from me, and when I called her bluff, there wasn't a button for her to press on the cash register.

Problem 3: No wet naps.  I shouldn't have to ASK for wet wipes.  It's fried chicken.

When we did ask and got some, each was a tiny rectangle.  Hmmm.  Pretty sure we got bitter Popeyes brand wet wipes else where.."}
{"text":"Went there the first day it open. The worst customer service and the food was terrible. Never going back again."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!

First of all I think Popeye's has some of the best chicken around. With that said, this is the absolute worst location I've ever seen. I went there today to get a simple 3 piece mild dinner. I was in the drive thru and was told there would be an 11 minute wait. Since I wasn't in a hurry, I decided to wait but 11 minutes turned into 20. I became concerned when I saw other customers getting their food immediately in the drive-thru so I went in to see what the hold up was. 

When I entered, the lady manger (who didn't seem very friendly) was speaking with another employee and another customer who had already ordered walked up to the counter. Next something happened that I'll never forget. A roach crawled from the soda machine across the register counter and hid with the Mardi Gras beads that surrounded one of the registers. When I pointed it out to one of the employees she just said eww and went back to working. The manager made a half-@$$ attempt to grab the roach within the Mardi Gras beads with a paper towel and just gave up after 5 seconds. 

Ironically my food was given to me when this happened and the other customers and I just looked at each other speechless. One lady asked for the manager's name and was totally ignored. At this point myself, and a few other people got refunds and left. The sad thing is that this isn't the first problem this location has had. They've had long wait times for years and had recently been improving. Now they're worse than ever and giving Popeye's a bad name."}
{"text":"Thought I would try this location since they just opened up. I went through the drive-thru, the guy that took my order was rude and when he repeated my order I asked him if he got my red beans for my side and he said rudly it already comes with that (which isn't true) a women came to the window and handed me the box with the fork wrapped in the napkin put in the box. I asked for a bag and they just handed it to me with my change. Never got offered what sauce I would like nothing. Worst customer service I've experienced when going to a popeyes. Definitely will not be going back here."}
{"text":"Place was very clean and gave me fresh tenders right off the fryer.  I would recommend others to go here if in area . I have been going here for a few weeks now since I moved in the area . Service has always been great and food has always been fresh ."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Customer service leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"I tried Popeye's for the first time yesterday and today I was craving it again! So I went to the one closest to my house and it was good. only thing I was bummed about is the one I went to the previous day in Laveen had the coke machine that you can mix different flavors! Popeye's is now my favorite fast food chicken joint."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I ordered the 11 piece deal + fries. Cashier said it would take 15 minutes for them to make the chicken fresh. So i waited...and waited and waited ...for about 25 minutes. In between they were serving other ppl with fresh spicy chicken. I thought maybe because they have a small order. Finally i asked her again how long it will take and she said another 3 minutes. So again i waited...another ten minutes until she finally called me to pick up the order. I took the order and hurried home. Of course, she never put the fries in there and instead of 11 there were 10 pieces. If you do go there make sure they give you  your full order. Only reason they get 1 star is because the chicken was fresh."}
{"text":"Really good fast food fried chicken when fresh.  They have a 6.99 8 Piece Mixed coupon available on the website...so I forgive them for the generous amounts of sodium they use in the batter.

Fat people love fried chicken and fat people love sodium....so its par for the course."}
{"text":"I placed a phone order at 10pm and got to the restaurant by 10:30 to pick it up. All of the employees were cleaning the restaurant with customers still eating inside and the kitchen staff was mopping and sweeping with food still cooking. I added a second large fry to my order and they had to cook a new batch because they did not have any more ready. The cook who was mopping and sweeping....with no gloves on, dropped the fries in the fryer and then continued to clean. I stood watching this happen because they had chairs blocking off the dining area so they could clean, so I had to stand by the counter. 10 minutes later when the fries were done cooking, the same guy pulled them out and grabbed the pan to drop them in...,he NEVER washed his hands. Not once! I asked the girl who was boxing the fries if they were suppose to wash their hands before handling the food...she said yes. I told her that he didn't and I was disgusted. I will NEVER return. The restaurant doesn't close until midnight...why are they cleaning at 10:30 and making customers feel uncomfortable. No one wants the table next to them sprayed with cleaner while they are eating. Poor management and zero concern for cleanliness."}
{"text":"3 times we've had bad service ... 1.5 hrs for delivery and forgot our pop and gravy.  The don't take themselves offline on JustEat when they can't deliver so JustEat refunded us the last time and advised they would be conducting a service review. Looking at the reviews below I can see nobody has really had a good experience with these guys.  I'll go to the one on Yonge street.   They know how to take care of their customers."}
{"text":"I don't even want to give this location a star... not only did I wait 15 mins for the fish to be ready from the drive thru, my order was completely wrong. The fish (which was suppose to be fresh since I waited) was soggy, didn't get the popcorn chicken I ordered or the side sauce... They clearly forgot about my order or gave it to one of the other people waiting. They really need to get their s*** together. I will drive an extra 15 mins to another location."}
{"text":"Everything tasted good and fresh. Polite and friendly staff. Fast service. It was a very clean location, as I have noticed others in Scarborough that simply aren't. Best place when you crave Southern Fried Chicken and Biscuits!"}
{"text":"This is the best popeyes location I've ever been to here. The chicken is always hot and fresh. Usually you'll get your order within 10 minutes. If you're getting a deal of the day it'll only take about 30 seconds though. Once I waited 15 minutes since they were out of mild and they even offered me a free pop while I was waiting. Open till 10pm and on ubereats too which is nice"}
{"text":"The chicken nuggets are the best ever. The biscuits are buttermilky and buttery. The fries are good when hot, like all fries. The other sides are just fair to rather pass. But what gives them the one star is service. Everytime I went they took 20 minutes to prepare my order and the girl there gives me attitude and smart ass remarks and gave me old fries one time on purpose. I watched her do it. After 3 rude incidents with the girl and the long waits, I don't bother going anymore. Not worth putting me in a bad mood."}
{"text":"This location is still open but shouldn't be. It's terrible service. I've waited up to 30 minutes for TAKE OUT. I've been given dried hard rice and beans before. The strips are the size of half a strip for other locations. Fries are dry--I've even seen fresh fried fries be dropped out of the fryer in a brick to be broken up. Speaking of--you get the smallest pinch of fries with your combo, about half the amount of a normal serving. 

Skinny guy that works cash is an asshole--very condescending. No one cleans up the place. There's been times a whole entire section of tables was full of bits of food and trays with bones and cups. Take out or dine in, had to always ask for napkins or a spork. No napkins available to just take when needed.

This location was basically the relocation of the Yonge and Wellesley location before it got shut down for condo development. But it's an absolute dump. You're better off walking to the one at Yonge and Dundas or even better, the one near Yonge and Isabella."}
{"text":"I use this location for catering every month for work, very nice and easy to work with. I was excited to find out that they were building a new Popeyes closer to my work on Elliot which would make it much easier to pick up our work lunches.  But I was disappointed to find out that they do not do any catering out of the new store, which was shocking to find a restaurant that would not take our money to do a order. If you are looking for a Popeyes stick with the Broadway location."}
{"text":"I've lived here in LV for the pass year. Each and every time I visit this location my order is wrong. I'm a creature of habit so I always get spicy chicken strips, fries and a Coke. Honestly I believe due to the lack of maturity this staff has, they don't care about the customer or the brand.

Tonight I paid them a visit and wanted the usual spicy chicken strips, fries and a Coke. They said it will take 10 min to cook them. 10 min pass, then they tell me that their out. 

If you visit an hour before they close and want spicy chicken you're out of luck."}
{"text":"Great staff. Food was fresh and fast. Connected to a circle k , definitely a lot nicer than circle k. Looks like all new furniture in the dining room.  Will definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"Better value at KFC.  
Be careful of cash transactions at this place. Be careful of giving small change.  I got ripped off by $0.05. My total was $10.78 and I gave the cashier $10.85 in cash. He was suppose to give me back $0.05, but did not.  $0.05 is nothing to me.  
Do once, they can do it twice. Maybe in a larger value.
Cashier didn't put my cash value in the receipt.  Cashier input my cash value as exact amount as requested on receipt."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. Food was undercooked to the point of being cold, wet, soggy. I had to re-cook everything when I got home to make sure I didn't get sick. Got about 1/4 of the items I ordered, which took 1 hour of waiting. Paid for $40 worth of food, got about $20. Completely left out some items, gave me others out of carelessness. If I could give lower than 1 star, I would. This location is a terrible Popeyes."}
{"text":"March 15/13 update.  Well, GOODBYE TO THIS LOCATION OF POPEYES.  Recently when I made my way back to the counter after finding (as usual) no condiments or napkin in the bag, and respectfully took my place in line behind several other complainers.  -  I was behind a customer who was saying that she got the spicy chicken rather than the hot that she had requested.  Not having much else to do, I idly noticed that one of the pieces of chicken in the box had a couple of bites out of it, and the other was only slightly beat-up.  The manager (I think) told the server girl to put the slightly used piece of chicken back in the warmer.  \"Somebody else can eat that one!\" he said.  Where is the department of health when you need them.  Yuck, I will never go back there.

-----------------------------------

Feb. 13/13 - There are never any forks, napkins, condiments or wetnaps included with takeout to clean your hands.  Since there no forks, you have to eat with your hands, which means you must clean your hands somehow.  Sometimes napkins are forgotten in takeout, but today I got one.  I have taken to checking the bag before I leave, and always find myself in a tug of war to get one more ketchup or maybe a fork.  There are no wetnaps unless they are withholding that information.  I like their greasy chicken so I will probably go back though."}
{"text":"Poor service. Don't waste your time.

They charges extra for everything. Had to wait 15 mins for mild tenders. Had to ask for condiments and napkins. There's a debit fee the employee didn't mention. Oh and it was dirty. 

Staff was rude and need a serious attitude adjustment."}
{"text":"Nope! Never again! Disgusting lobby. Perhaps the lazy little girls texting and instagramming could wipe a table or sweep a freaking floor.  And for the love of GOD could ANYONE wear some freaking gloves? Someone call the health department!"}
{"text":"Arrrrrg! This is the second time out of three times that we have ordered an 8 piece meal at this location and they only put 7 pieces in the box..... Food tastes wonderful but really? The first time we let it slide. The second drive through was correct cause we checked before we drive off so we figured it was a one time mistake. Then we drive all the way home this time and guess what? 7 pieces again. Check your orders at this location."}
{"text":"Horrible!  

1). They don't have a Tuesday special. Isn't all franchises supposed to follow the same deals?!?!

2). They messed up our order. I brought the wrong side up to the counter. The manager ( she was the one wearing the collared shirt, everyone else was in polo shirts) said in a very RUDE tone, \" Are you sure?!?!\"  I said yes. Like she didn't believe me!  I am not trying to get free food lady!  Where is the customer service?  I walked back to the table and realized they forgot one of our biscuits. Smh!  My hubby said never mind. The staff was already too busy with the dinner rush. 

3). My husband's tarter sauce container had a cut in the top of the seal. I told him not to even touch it. You don't know how long it has been cut. Come on now!  Is there no quality control for what orders you send out?

I feel that they are not concerned with what they are putting out. With the rush of customers, they were just trying to get the food out as fast a possible. The only reason why they even get any stars is the food still tasted amazing!  When I want fried chicken and those southern sides. I always go to Popeye's.  Thank goodness for the kitchen cooks. Great job!  The front line needs some work!!!"}
{"text":"The owner thinks he knows everything and the customer doesn't. Service is terrible and food is a hit and miss. I've seen chicken sit in the display for over 2hours.  Is that still fresh?   Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Best Popeye's I've been to in years.  Peeling the batter off the back of the juicy deep fried chicken breast made me think I was back in New Orleans. Just wish they had the onion rings."}
{"text":"Ordered at drive through. Was told our chicken will be ready in 12 minutes and will be delivered to my car if I park at the front. We had to come down and check up with them 30 minutes later and were told to wait 5 more minutes. 10 minutes later, we asked for our food once more and weren't given a clear answer. What was supposed to be a 15- minute stop for fast food turned into a wait of over an hour. Very inefficient :("}
{"text":"This place is the worst in service. There are eight people working there and nobody notice it that I was standing by the register waiting for one of them to take my order. They had so much time for their own chatting that they don't pay attention customers coming in. Very, very bad. Never ever again they're gonna have my business."}
{"text":"Simple and to the point. All the 1 and 2 star reviews are VERY I repeat VERY accurate.......all of them. Drive to another location."}
{"text":"This place only deserves 1 star because it is close to my house. 

We went through drive thru. Pulled over to check our order and our items are missing and sauces as well. I go into the store with my receipt. told the cashier that they forgot my item and she doesn't even believe me. Made me bring my bag of food from my car back into the store so she can verify it.

The customer service here sucks like crazy. 

Another thing is this place will charge for sauces if you get more than what it \"comes with\". 

We always go to the one on Stephanie because they always give good service and anything you want. They are the friendliest location in town. 

And ontop of that the one on Stephanie lets you upgrade your meals to a 2 sides and a larger drink for only $1.20 or $1.00 but THIS ONE DOESNT. 

WILL NEVER RETURN HERE AGAIN. I rather drive an additional 2 miles to the Stephanie location."}
{"text":"The french fries were soggy and chewy. I picked up 8pc chicken and a large fry. The fries were supposed to be half my dinner. They were not even edible. How hard is it to cook french fries? Manager said I could drive all the way back and get new fries. What good is that? Then my entire meal is ruined. It is supposed to be fast food...not leave my house twice to pick up properly cooked food."}
{"text":"Close this joint already. I will never understand how a chicken place runs out of the whole freaking menu 4 hours before closing time. Only legs and thighs, in one flavor, really?

So either supreme laziness is the culprit or a poorly managed location, either way forgetaboutit."}
{"text":"Apparently this location changed hands.  I tried contacting the corporate office about my experience and have not received a reply.  Employees don't seem to care, and don't give customers register receipts with their orders (probably because they have survey invitations) management doesn't seem to care either.  Gang affiliated \"friends\" of employees are allowed to lounge in the dining area and spew racist comments loudly,threaten customers, and throw furniture.  My last and final visit to this location makes me glad that I carry..

Definitely not a place to bring family to either eat or pick up food."}
{"text":"Just popped in to try their new \"Ghost Pepper\" wings. Small pigeon wings and drumsticks that are battered and deep fried.  Thery are about as spicy as KFC original reciepe, but not as good.

What is the point of advertising ghost peppers if it isn't spicy?"}
{"text":"Went to this location Sunday morning 10:30 am. Fast & friendly service at the drive thru! Ordered a 12 piece spicy chicken combo with red beans & rice and the yummy mashed potatoes. Also the blackened chicken strips, super with the blackened ranch dip. I see a lot of negative comments here, so we were a little apprehensive to go here. The food was hot & fresh!! Definitely will come back again!!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood to gorge on some fried foods since I just walked/jogged 3 miles at the fitness. When my bear returned with 5 lbs of food I was quite shocked and surprised at the sheer of meaty goodness. It was the 12pc meal with 2 reg sides and a dozen biscuits. according to my bear, mgr at this location was apologetic and gave him 2 free apple pies as a courtesy b/c one the employee was flipping out or was having a bad day I wasn't there so I don't know or care.

anyway, on to the food.. chicken was delish it was fried just right, not too crispy or soggy. right amount of flavor, spiciness, saltiness, etc... 2 sides were mashed taters and red beans & rice.. both very good! right amount of heat, cajun style of course and both very rich and savory. biscuits were a little on the salty side but it was still good. warm & fluffy inside. 

Also, don't get the 10pc meal advertised on the window cuz its not a good deal according to the mgr here. get the 12pc meal so you can get 1 extra side and its only a buck more. So, If you're in the mood for some fried chicken and you're tired of the same ole' disgusting 8pc chicken at Fry's, safeway, albertson's, or god forbid KFC then give this popeye's a try! I think they exceeded my expectation as far as quality, taste, service (according to my bear), and value. I have enough chicken + sides+biscuits for another 3 meals and then some. so thats why it cost $32 bucks and didnt bring any change back! doh! Oh I almost forgot, bear got the catfish sandwich as well and i took a bite or two it was very delish as well!."}
{"text":"It's Popeyes, which is always good if you crave down-home, Southern-fried, artery-clogging \"comfort food\". I was there on Fat Tuesday and the manager was walking around giving kids Mardi Gras beads, which I thought was pretty dope. Hard to beat for the amount of food you get and consistent quality. Suspiciously good biscuits...what the hell do they put in those things?"}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch from here for me and my mom. She got shrimp and I got chicken, where she has had bad stomach aches. I unfortunately have had constipation, vomiting and horrific stomach aches. I would recommend staying away from this places because once I asked my friends about there run in with this restaurant. They are all bad from just straight up bad food to getting sick like me. Just like my friends I don't think I will ever go back to this place."}
{"text":"worst service and I have tried three times. Order is wrong every time.  1st time no biscuit, 2nd timne ran out of cole slaw and asked for ranch got tarter sauce.  Today ran out of cole slaw again asked for mashed potatoes no gravy and a ranch and a tarter...got mashed potatoes with gravy and two tarter sauces.  Will not go there again."}
{"text":"The food is good, however the employees are literally stupid. Can't get an order right to save their lives."}
{"text":"Consistently juicy and crispy chicken, classic Popeye's sides.  Very pleasant customer service... Both glad and fat since they opened close to me. Thanks, Popeye's on Park Lawn!"}
{"text":"Food was great as always (what I could eat anyway)  went thru the drive thru and ordered checked strips and a side of red beans and rice, got no fork or napkins.  She was damn sure to up sell a large drink though"}
{"text":"It clearly states that the drive thru is opened until 11:00PM and I arrived at 10:40PM, I know it was close to closing but I had just gotten off work, and they stated they were closed. Everyone in there was sitting around waiting to get off. This is not the first time I've had problems with this location. I'm done with Popeyes."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  We were told 6 minute wait..turned into 30 mins and counting!  Spend the extra 10mins and go somewhere else!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Every time we visit this restaurant they are under staffed and out of chicken. Today at 5:20 we went thru the drive through and we were still setting in the parking lot at 5:45 waiting on our order. During this time we have heard customers complaining about service as they left and one customer return to the store with his order in hand. 

Finally my wife went in and when she got the order it wasn't complete so she asked for the manager. Darlene the manager was screaming at the employees and very rude to her so she asked for a refund. Darlene the manager told my wife Popeyes is not a fast food restaurant and offered the food for free. My wife refused and Darlene said \"oh well, it's no big deal\". 

KFC was less expensive, took less than 5 minutes from order to delivery and they were very nice."}
{"text":"I will never go to Popeyes again. First of all I went on a Tuesday which was supposed to be their 2 piece chicken for $3.29. Knowing it was for just the chicken I opted for 2 meals to go and the prices ended up coming near $20.00 which I was totally shocked for. At that price I could've gotten way better food. However, I bought it anyways. When I got home I started eating one of the meals took a bite of one of the thigh pieces and I see the most red meat I've ever seen in my life. It was literally dripping off my lip. It looked like when I dissected a heart in college. I will be returning for a full refund. I didn't even open the second box."}
{"text":"Today would have been the first time I would have tried Popeyes chicken after having seen one of their commercials I was drawn in to give it a try.   The commercial advertises that the dippin chicken is available for a limited time and or 4.99 and when I got to the drive thru it was 5.99 but since the food in de commercial looked good I decided to still order it since I am not familiar with their products.  Then the lady in the drive they said they do not have the product anymore.    This was an unpleasant visit.  The image the restaurant gave me was not one to go drive to another location that could have the product.   Not a good first impression ):"}
{"text":"Out of everything and rushed to place my order just to receive a drink covered in soda with a wet straw stuck to the side of it. Don't be ghetto smh"}
{"text":"I love Popeyes' food, especially the red beans and biscuits, but this location on S. Durango is very slow, understaffed, will not accept their own gift cards, will not make change for over a $20 bill, has uncaring workers, and fills up my sides 75% of the way while charging me for the whole container in order to cut their costs on my last 3 visits.  Lots of other Popeyes locations to go to that care more about service, and there is a KFC across the street.  Since most businesses only care about money and not complaints, I suggest you vote with your feet."}
{"text":"Same as the experience of other reviewers here we also got a couple of our orders mixed up. Thankfully, the manager D'Angelo was there to assist and he made sure everything we needed was met and improve our overall experience. Would've been a disaster but this manager takes customer satisfaction seriously. For that reason alone, we shall visit again."}
{"text":"I CAN'T be certian but i'm almost POSTIVE I got sick for over 24 hours from this POPEYES went in side and saw a cock roach on the wall and I was so hungry I still ate the food and got SICK! Also the bathrooms were a shit show LITTERALLY! EW DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS POPEYES!!!!!!"}
{"text":"NOTICE DO NOT EAT HERE UNLESS YOU LIKE COLD FOOD. I would've rated 0 stars if I could have. The drive thru person is INCAPABLE OF TAKING 3 ORDERS. It is too \"hard\" to take 3 orders. We should have left right then and there. But unfortunately we went inside. When I was asked if I wanted spicy or mild chicken tenders I asked for the cashiers recommendation. She said uuuhhghmmm as she turned to look at the chicken she had available. She then said spicy so I said I would take mild because I asked for a recommendation based on taste not availability. I was then given attitude she said, \"really? The opposite of what I just said\" I said yes. The food I was given was terrible I will never ever try any Popeyes ever again. I don't even write yelp reviews but I downloaded the app just because of the terrible experience I had so that I could warn others to stay far far away. Food was terrible, service was a disaster this ruined my lunch. I now have a stomach ache back at work. Louisiana style chicken my ass."}
{"text":"Great value, good food, friendly service. Love the biscuits and red beans and rice. The spicy chicken is the best. The Po' Boy sandwich was nice size. I hope this store stays around. It is worth the drive from the North Hills."}
{"text":"I love Popeyes but this location is employed by slow rude people. The food is what you'd expect, but it's annoying when you ALWAYS make you park while you wait 20 mins for your food.  I know they're busy, but it's like every time I go here I have to park & wait."}
{"text":"This Popeyes has the worst service ever!! Waited 15 mins with only one car ahead of me only to get to the window and they say sorry what was your order! Then had to wait additional 5 minutes for spicy tenders!"}
{"text":"My 13 year old grandson and I stopped this last Sunday afternoon. He was impressed with the service he got from the young lady behind the counter. I didn't get her name but for a 13 year old to know the difference between a bad customer service and a good one says alot . Oh and he loved loved his chicken strips....the one on 151 is where we went. Not Fitchburg location."}
{"text":"Dude this is the worst popeyes I've been to.  Chicken was salty and had no other flavors.  Kinda pricey for what you got and the service (not bad) cant make up for the piss-poor food quality.  Wish there was a Churches nearby because this chicken SUCKS.  If I can cook better at home without even trying, its not worth coming here to eat salty tasteless chicken."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I generally order the same thing with varying sides. 3 piece SPICY tenders combo. SPICY, YOU TWITS. Today was my 6th experience going to this location. I thought maybe if I go inside this one time they'll get my order right. Go inside, cashier was cool. The girl who actually serves my food was a vapid millennial who not only gave me Regular tenders, but didn't bother to ask what sauce I wanted or throw in napkins or a spork. I've probably been to this location 6 times over the course of a year. 5 out of 6 they got my order wrong. 

I don't ask for much man, I don't even care if they jip me and give me small tender pieces. I just want functional employee's that give a hoot. So now I'm just going to drive further to my old location for competence."}
{"text":"Worst Location Ive been to out of all the popeyes Ive gone to.
The employees didnt seem to care, the service was bad (Which I dont care about I just want good food and to be out the door) well the food wasnt fresh, it was cold and the portion were the smallest Ive ever seen from a popeyes chain.  I was so pissed off. Serious rip off from this place, never will I go there again."}
{"text":"Always love this location, Ive tried the one at 400/Major Mackenzie and it sucked compared to this place.  The only other location I go to is Yonge/Elgin Mills which is in Richmond Hill and its also amazing.

Great service, always fresh and tastes amazing."}
{"text":"Great Staff, Fresh food (Literally every time I go its just coming out of the fryer), great taste & value."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE AFTER 930PM... The employees are more worried about getting out of there on time than getting your order right... customer service is out the window after 10... I ordered the 6 piece tenders with BBQ sauce and mash potatoes... I got home to find a 3 1/2 piece in the with coleslaw.... and NO SAUCE!!! I went back there... got there at 10:05 pm... but nobody would come to the window or answer the door... CHECK YOUR MEAL BEFORE LEAVING THE WINDOW. #Disappointed"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have had similar negative experiences with speed of service and customer service but this day was  exceptional. I was served by Chaka F and she was so pleasant. Quite a difference in the usual attitude of the other girls you usually come across here. It's nice to see some class and business maturity. The place was clean, lots of chicken prepped... ready for business. They have the signage up for the Tuesday special which I gather was a standard complaint about this location.
They seem to be working on improving the operational mishaps presented on Yelp. I just wanted to give accolades when they are due. With some more right hiring and training, this location will improve. I mean, the food quality is already great. Please keep it up!"}
{"text":"12/28/13.....Love Popeyes, but will never go back to this one.  This is one of the filthiest Popeyes I have ever seen.  The tables, pop dispensing area, and the floor was filthy.  It made for a very uncomfrotable dining experience."}
{"text":"The review is for the service I received tonight at the drive-thru.

My husband and I stopped by Popeyes before heading to work. I ordered a \"MILD 3pc Wing Combo\" but realized it was spicy when I bit into it. The husband ordered a \"Spicy 3pc Reg Chicken Combo\" but got chicken tenders. He had upgraded his medium drink to a large along with his spicy meal, but got a medium drink (we were waiting for awhile in line and at the window and already had to go). I tried calling the location at 702-407-9179 after realizing the mistake on BOTH meals and a couple times after that, but each time it was busy. Just pretty disappointing when you are looking forward to a meal before work."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location I receive the most unwelcoming service... and from the same cashier that I believe is the manager! This time I arrived home with no honey like I had asked and not a napkin in the bag!"}
{"text":"It's fast food so nothing fancy but I've had no problems here.  It's clean, people have been friendly and service has been fast.  So far I've only had to wait once for spicy tenders to cook, it was during the Sunday dinner rush so wasn't surprised and if you're going to complain about a 5 minute wait at the most well that says more about you."}
{"text":"Okay, I am going to preface this review by saying the food is great as always. Big fan of the chicken tenders and sides etc. I work at a dealership across the street and we all go here a lot since it's opened. With that said, there's been a lot of mess ups by these guys and I don't blame the entry level food servers as much as I do the managers and leadership, because they need to get their sh+t together and I'll give you a few examples. 

The three times I've been through the drive thru, something was jacked up every time. Other guys at my work, they've had similar mishaps. The first time, they had given me a family sized meal instead of an individual so it was tons of food and a huge side portion. I hadn't been to Popeyes in a long time and thought $15 was a lot lol and they also didn't put any BBQ dip or the Cajun sparkle in the bag. Second time I went I made sure to get the right 3 piece meal and they gave me a couple packages of sparkle and now two sauces then he proceeds to hand me my receipt, fork, sparkle, two dips and my credit card back to me stacked on top of the box nearly falling out of the dudes hand... I asked where the bag was and he replied with \"Oh we don't give out bags\"... I said okay you all just let the stuff fall all over the place? Where am I supposed to put this sh*t in my freakin glove box? Wtf? Anyway, the 3rd and most recent visit today I asked for the bag, made sure my drink was the right one, and made sure I had dipping sauce and sparkle... Check. Get back to the store and I knew I should have looked inside the damn box because I got what was essentially one chicken strip and two freakin chicken nuggets... Not even enough to be considered half a strip each. 

Look, this is a new place and I'm sure these guys are new and not the seasoned $15/hr veterans, but come on! Get it right! It starts with management! Fix these stupid f* ups and you'll be doing much better. 

That's all... Still good chicken though."}
{"text":"FRY SOME CHICKEN!!  This place never has chicken ready. It's like oh duh you want chicken. Get this Popeyes, you are fast food, waiting 20 minutes for you to cook more chicken is poor planning and it costs you business. Next, when you do prepare an order - check it. I have never received the correct order from your team. I just encountered your general manager Luis, he lacks professionalism as well as good communication skills. We came through drive thru and ordered a 12 pic dinner. Luis says, we only have 2 legs left. Sorry about that. He does not offer any solutions until I drive around and drag it out of him. He has a bad attitude and is rude. He needs proper training. Good luck Popeyes selling chicken when your employees are unwilling to cook it!!"}
{"text":"Clean, exceptional and affordable. We went in on 04/04/17 around 9 p.m. I love this new location and am glad to see this branch help with the employment of our community high school (Mountain Ridge). A junior from the nearby school took our order and delivered it to us he was superb I just wish we could recall his name so he could get credit for his hard work!  It may have been Nick?"}
{"text":"Ron at this location has the worse customer service I have ever experienced. And based on the reviews seems like everyone else sucks pretty bad as well. I Never leave reviews especially at a freaking fast food place but I am completely disgusted at the way I was treated the past two times he helped me at the drive thru (and I cancelled my order both times due to this). Go to canes up the street.."}
{"text":"Nothing special, The usually Popeyes that you get. Great location since its the first once near alot of homes.The chicken is usually hot and freshly fried since a lot of people come. The staff are friendly the facility is clean with a few good size tables for a few friends to go and eat either during lunch or highschool kids after school."}
{"text":"A small scoop of mashed potatoes for $2 with (3) pieces of the most greasiest bland chicken ever at $8 and a cashier who can barely speak English makes this place definitely off limits after (2) visits. They just can't seem to get things right there.

And they also charge .75 for an extra SAUCE, a f***** SAUCE

(3)piece chicken meal incl( a liter of grease) 
extra side (practically a tablespoon or a side for a baby) 
a cashier who can barely understand english 
= $9.42

I felt as though I had to finish this crap after paying so
much for it. The sides are good but way overpriced!"}
{"text":"Feeling hungry, my family and I decided to get Popeyes. The lady on the drive thru speaker was acting like she didn't care what we wanted to order. We had to repeat what we wanted to order 3 times. .__. 

It took 15 minutes to get our food. 

When we got home we saw that our order was wrong. Instead of mashed potatoes, we got fries. 

The food is great, but I wish the service is better."}
{"text":"I Love southern style chicken...   But this place Has NO Southern Hospitality.. !!!   The service is Really Bad..  No good afternoon,  No Thank you,  No have a good day, -    Drive thru they give you the box and sauces stacked on each other with No bag !!  you have to ask for a Bag..    No Smile..   Just terrible..   All employee are the same..  That Reflects 100% on management..  If management was good, if management had trained employees to treat customers in a good manner, and if management had trained employees to care, then they would have... But I guess management is not good..   This is many times I go there,  same bad experience..  Not to mention, every time something is missing from the order..."}
{"text":"I try and try again with this location and it never gets better. The employees are always unfriendly, if they even speak to you at all. Every single time I've gone through the drive thru, I either have to choose to get out and go inside or leave without half of what I ordered. They are always out of something. I was so excited for a location to open in this neighborhood, but I'd rather drive further for a good experience than visit this location again."}
{"text":"First of all Popeyes chicken is the very best.  So happy they at now in the Valley. 
Tony is the manager of this particular one and I do have to say customer service is his top priority. We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Do not place a delivery with them - very unscrupulous!
I placed an order through just eat and when I called I was told they had already delivered it - to some woman. They then proceeded to argue with me and that no I wouldn't get my order and no I wouldn't get my money back. I contacted just eat - they had two orders to my building. No apologies and no explanation as to how they can have two orders and two payments and only deliver to one person. Very poor business with rude and incompetent staff. Just eat will refund my money but this place refused to redo the order as they are an hour from closing. Absolutely disgusting.
Now it's late and I have to find an alternative - don't waste your time, try orderit.ca - never had such a problem with them."}
{"text":"I look for Popeye's when I feel like having fried chicken and beer! Very friendly staff with excellent service. I asked them if they could make fresh 10 pcs of chicken and within 10 minutes it was ready to go. I will definitely go back there again."}
{"text":"On a Saturday afternoon around 2pm, this place was not busy at all. So, going through the drive thru with no cars waiting, you would think it would be fast. Nope, think again.. We had to pull over and wait for 15 minutes. The women in  the drive thru was not friendly at all and would say \"ok\" after every comment. The food was over fried, almost burned and was not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Ever since Popeyes increased their prices things have been going down hill. I expect more now from the service and it's all the same . 

Lower the prices or improve ur service"}
{"text":"They make chicken for a living. It shouldn't take 20 minutes to make 3 tenders. And every time I come there soda never works. All I want is some chicken in a timely manner"}
{"text":"I just ordered food there because my wife and kids wanted a bit to eat.Tired of the thanks giving left overs. The order we choose was the mixed 12 piece mixed family meal. Around 10:00pm
The chicken was old and we had a 3 minutes wait on the dries that were old and stail. I will never in life go back to this place in life. I was thinking about calling and complaining to the manager but I honestly think all they would do is comp a meal. I think it I'll pass on the whole idea of this crappy place. I gave one star but that's over doing it.."}
{"text":"Service was slow. Staff acted like they didn't care. Received my 5 PC tenders still raw. I love their food but could deal without their attitude. 20 minute wait for my family to get our food. With a wait this long you would think that our chicken would be cooked through. Popeyes corporate needs to visit this store. We were the only people in the store and had to wait, 7/14/2014 @ 6pm."}
{"text":"Food is average, very typical fried chicken, It's what you expect it to be. I usually get the spicy chicken sandwich. What bothers me the most about this location is no matter when I go, the size of the chicken in my sandwich is small, compared to other locations at least. 

Place is still better than KFC though"}
{"text":"Nothing much to say here. They sell chicken and do a pretty good job at it. Food was served fast and the place was clean.  I would choose this place before KFC."}
{"text":"The chicken must have been in the fridge for a while before it got cooked, or left out, or old.  Whatever it was, the next morning, I was running fast to the toilet.  Didn't have anything else questionable, so no doubt in my mind.  The meat was rotten and they served it anyway and for that, I will never go into any Popeye's for as long as I am not starving to DEATH!

Fries were, ya know, fries and the biscuit was meh.  Don't think I will ever return."}
{"text":"As a general rule I don't review fast food chains, because well they are fast food chains, most people know what they are walking into and what to expect. But I felt inclined to comment as they have a fabulous Tuesday deal and I had to get the word out (and no they are not paying me to advertise). For $1.29 you can get two dark pieces of chicken (leg and thigh) on Tuesday and an additional $1.89 gets you a large drink, side of your choice and biscuit. Can't beat that with a stick! I went to the Craig Road location, although through my familiarity of Popeye's around town , I have had the two piece deal at the Rancho/95 location for 99 cents, when the Craig Road was $1.29. I don't know if it is still 99 cents though. 

Anywho, I prefer the spicy chicken and red beans and rice. Which at one point in my life I actually though was healthy, red beans and rice what could be bad about that - of course I didn't realize, or maybe I was in denial, that it is most likely cooked in lard (lard...yum). Fortunately, and unfortunately at the same time, the small side - is well really small- which I considered portion control. But again for the price on Tuesdays you just can't beat it if you are looking for greasy comfort food."}
{"text":"Great staff. Great service. Unlike other locations they don't compromise on quality. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"For fast food fried chicken, I don't think it gets better than Popeye's! Love that chicken! I was ecstatic when it opened and I recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Would've given this location 5 stars because of the cashier Frank, who was incredibly nice and accommodating, but the manager was really rude. I didn't catch her name but we went today 05/07/17 at 3:50 PM. She was shouting at the other crew and it wasn't even busy at the store. We ordered extra regular and extra large gravy and it wasn't even halfway full. We just didn't want to argue with the manager because it's just gravy, but hell we paid $4 for thet. Never coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Best service and staff ive seen in popeyes chicken is always fresh!!

Spicy chicken all the way, mild is too salty, the buttermilk biscuits are so buttery ask for honey and make a honey filles biscuit sandwich its really good. If u get tenders go with buttermilk ranch, blackend ranch or sweet heat.

The butterfly and popcorn shrimp are nice snack if ur not too hungry, get it the the seafood sauce thats just my preference. Others like to get blackend ranch..."}
{"text":"Best popeyes friendly staff service is always really quick and owner is always around to chat with"}
{"text":"I'm always weary of new restaurants opening up, however this Popeyes has blown me away! The chicken is amazing it's crunchy and moist and not dripping grease like KFC. Also has way more flavor from those signature Cajun spices. Best sides in town. Customer service is good compared to most which wouldn't affect the 5 stars. I mean c'mon they're teenagers. As long as they look clean and are somewhat respectable when speaking, I'm all good with it!"}
{"text":"Love me some Popeyes.. mild or spicy.. it doesnt' matter.  The chicken is always cripsy and juicy, and tastes good.. even when cold!  
No more going to the other chicken place run by the Colonel."}
{"text":"Smells like sewage when I walked in, maybe they had a sewage back up with all the rain we had. 

Chicken sandwich had two slices of both ends of a tomatoe. Did not eat them. See pic posted. 

Slow service, felt like I was inconveniencing the staff.  I was the only customer in the store."}
{"text":"I am reviewing this restaurant with three stars because I like their food, but this particular location I was not impressed with their service. When I walked in I was greeted and explained that I did not know what I would like to eat yet because I do not often comes to this restaurant, and once I did decide what I would like to eat the worker took quite a long time before she came back to me. My food took long enough, But on top of that, when I went back up to the register to ask for a sauce packet I had to wait quite a while before I received it. The drive-through girl and I made eye contact while she was doing absolutely nothing, just standing there. She did not come over to ask me what I could use and everybody else was working along the kitchen line and nobody looked up to me to see that a customer needed anything. Finally, I alerted the girl at the drive-through that I wanted a sauce packet and she brought it to me. Having worked at McDonald's, I was not very impressed with the customer service. The food was good, though! I will be returning here, for that reason."}
{"text":"First of all, this isn't the first time they messed up my order this is the THIRD time. I keep giving them the benefit of the doubt cause they biscuits is BANGIN & they screw me over every time. Y'all suck. Never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I can't believe its a new place and they don't have any chicken special like other places in town! I rather drive 4 miles away to get their special with better customers service!"}
{"text":"I ordered the 10 pc w/ 5 biscuits, and 2 large sides for $29.99. When I got my order I got 4 biscuits. I called back the store and told the guy I only got 4 he said, yeah that's the deal. I then looked online for the deal that I just got and it said I was supposed to receive 5 biscuits, so now I'm pissed off because the guy blatantly lied to me. I called back and asked for my biscuits, the guy said he made a \"mistake\" and that next time I'll get double. I told him I don't order food like that and that I'll most likely never order from here again. He started raising his voice saying \"Do what you want! Do what you want!!\" I said, I wanted a refund and that the delivery guy could come back for the food, OR they could give me my biscuits. He got upset again and started yelling \"GIVE YOU A REFUND FOR WHAT?  NO, I'M NOT GIVING REFUND!\" So I said well then give me my biscuits, you shouldn't have lied about my order. (mind you my order was made in and delivered in 20 mins. I have a feeling they only had 4 and just threw them in the bag because they weren't even hot and I didn't live too far from the popeye's) He started yelling \"WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! WHAT DID I SAY BEFORE! I SAID I MADE A MISTAKE!\" Okay, I get that it was a mistake, but I still don't see why I couldn't get my biscuits....Then he said Okay, okay how many biscuits do you want? 1, 2, 4, 5? How many do you want? I said I want 5 fresh ones and I'll pay for the one that I ate, I got 4 I ate one there is now 3 left. After arguing on the phone for about 10 minutes over freaking biscuits, he said, they take a while to deliver because the delivery guy was out. I said okay, but I just didn't bother waiting around for the biscuits because I was afraid they might  have done something to them. I'm NEVER ORDERING POPEYE'S AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Oh my god I went again. This is not good for my arteries. I got the spicy 2 piece dinner, with a side of mashed potatoes and Cajun gravy, and it includes a biscuit. THEN I added an additional biscuit, because
I could die tomorrow, and what if I never ate an additional biscuit? Let's be real people, biscuits at
Popeyes are...flakey, crumbly melt in your mouth soft...a little salty on the crust from generous amounts of butter coating... 

The chicken was very crispy and did not have a huge Layer of fat and skin right underneath like KFC does. Lots of flakiness and crumbs from the breading and it's delicious!! But I will still to my chicken tenders because it's just my preference. I would however always recommend to get an extra biscuit per chicken piece. ITS THAT GOOD."}
{"text":"This service was very bad and there was no other customers there. Got overcharged and they still didn't get the order correct. Ended up getting the same amount as my friend who paid $6 less."}
{"text":"Food tastes fine, 1 star for service/competency.. went through the drive thru around dinner time and ordered 2 tenders combos with 3 extra biscuits. Got asked to pull around and wait for \"fresh tenders.\" 7 MINUTES later I finally get my meal. It doesn't take more than 5 minutes to fry up some tenders and there was no one in the store so I don't know what they were doing in there. I come home and then realize, they forgot my 3 extra biscuits! After all that time they get such a basic task wrong! They have forgotten extra biscuits on my meal at least 3 times now. Such a basic task. I know I should check my order before I leave but this is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken MILD and was given SPICY instead. So I had to drive back from home to get my order changed. The staff in blue uniform who must have been the supervisor didn't even apologize for their mistake. I even had to argue with him as he won't give me my receipt back."}
{"text":"Well first time having Popeye's Chicken and I have to say the chicken strips are really good. I also think their Cajun fries are a good signature item. Popcorn shrimp were a little too battered for my taste and could not really taste the shrimp, but I really was not expecting much anyhow. I will be back to try their chicken. If it's anything like their chicken tenders then it should be good.
I do have to say the front counter could be a little more engaging and nicer, and least pretend she enjoyed her $10.00 an hour job. 
I express it was my first time there and I was not sure what to order, but from her stare behind the counter I see that  she did not care. I will try it again anyway. I like to think anyone could be having a bad day."}
{"text":"Don't make me  wrong,I love popeye's chicken and there are only few locations in Mississauga.Hoping that this location do delivery which they do but wtf,how could you place an order without providing a number man."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Popeyes and have been going to this location since it opened. I've never had a problem with the accuracy of my order and the quality of the food is consistently good. The employees are friendly for the most part. 

The only actual issue I've ever had here was a time I ordered a spicy chicken breast. They were out at the time so the girl at the counter offered a free extra mild breast - sweet!"}
{"text":"I was so excited there was a Popeyes near but there were a few times when I went I did not enjoy my food and will not be going back. first of all marisol did a great job with addressing my issue and made sure I left a happy Customer.  but Alfredo and CeCe have horrible customer service skills CeCe kept interuppting me when i was trying to tell her the issue I was experiencing then she told me she does not believe me because Alfredo stated he did not remember my complaint because he never wrote it down so then CeCe told me to come back in an hour to speak to Alfredo and when I went back stated he left for the day. I ask CeCe if she is a manager that shouldn't she be able to make her own decisions she stated no I ask for the store owner info she refused to give it to me. so essentially I still left upset and when I want Popeyes I will drive the extra miles to get good customer service. never go there...."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Popeye's in the chain.  The employees are extremely friendly.  The service is always fast, and they go out of the way to make sure we get what we want.  The lady behind the counter also recommended we go to the website to get a discount coupon for what we were ordering.  We showed the coupon on our phone and got a great deal.  We make this our first stop every time we drive to Vegas."}
{"text":"Popeye's is always legit. All you need to know is the 2-piece dinner, spicy, dark meat, with either mashed potatoes or cajun fries. Way better than KFC, slightly better than Church's. It's particularly good after a few drinks."}
{"text":"THIS RESTAURANT IS THE WORST!  

1st trip: they have only been open 3 days so I thought to give them a try. I ordered a 10 Piece box, brought it home and the chicken was cold and saturated with grease. I bring the chicken back and without looking in the box, the manager says we won't refund you as you have eaten most of the chicken... there was 8 pieces left. I did not get a refund as they had to talk to the GM. It took them 3 days for me to get the refund!

 2nd trip: My wife goes to get 4 chicken strip meals, she comes home and finds the sides are separated from the chicken, and there were only 2 meals that have the strips. So I tried to call and it goes to voice mail, so I go back to the location with the receipt and was told that they cannot straighten out the order without the WHOLE ORDER being returned. I told them my family is at home eating because obviously they are hungry, that didn't seem to matter to them... SO I had to go WITHOUT!  

These people ONLY CARE ABOUT THEMSELVES! 

 Do your self a favor and get some real chicken like KFC or RAISING CANES where they actually care about the customer!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience.  Everyone working was cheerful and very polite and accommodating.  The food was great.  We accidentally left a cell phone and they found it and held it for us until we returned.  The new manager was wonderful.  Great experience!  5 stars!"}
{"text":"How ghetto is this place. When the lady in the front taking my order while holding a cigarette in her hand (not lit) and then turning around and getting my food ready. African American lady.  So disgusting"}
{"text":"Decent enough drive through chicken. Biscuits seemed a little dry the last time. But all in all not bad for the money."}
{"text":"The manager here (short haired with the accent) is rude and disrespectful. I had a coupon for the $6.99 5 piece, 2 sides, 2 biscuits. I ordered two orders like I usually do no issue. Only when we got the food home and my wife bit into her biscuit there was a long strand of black/brown hair that followed. After being thoroughly disgusted. We called immediately to let them know what had happened. We were told she has never heard this before, it couldn't have been and she will replace just the one biscuit?! So we took the box back the next day to prove what we were saying and were met with the same attitude. Since the incident we've given them another chance and ordered the exact same deal. (Coupon Online!! if you live close to this area it's a good deal.) Now when we order and approach the window we're met with attitudes all around. I was told I couldn't order more than one meal at a time. When previously she had no issue giving us the order. So I brought my wife and was told we had to show the coupon on two separate  phones to get the meal. When we ask for sauce we were given 2 ranch for 10 pieces. I asked for more sauce the manager says \"MORE! SHEESH!\" I asked for hot sauce and was given 4 packets and a glare from hell for asking. Once we got home I realized they gave me red beans instead of green beans. They need to check into this location asap! NO STARS WOULD'VE BEEN MY RATING IF POSSIBLE."}
{"text":"I have been visiting the Aurora location  for several years.  It has been consistently exceeding my expectations in terms of quality and service. Furthermore, the owner and team have always been friendly and welcoming with each visit."}
{"text":"Long story short, I have food poisoning but the staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean.
I had never eaten at Popeye's until last night. I got the 3 tender combo and french fries. Everything else that I ate yesterday was completely typical of me, nothing new (Cheerios, a Slim Jim). The only thing that could have made me sick was the chicken. It also tasted like fish, not chicken. 
On the bright side, the staff obviously worked well together and the lobby and bathrooms were spotless, even though they were very busy."}
{"text":"Popeye is always one of my fav. Liked the mild chicken sandwich and some chicken pieces"}
{"text":"My husband came down sick during our vacation, so after spending half our day going to dr and getting meds we were hungry. Drove by saw sign had to stop. It's my husbands favorite chicken. The restaurant was very clean and service was good and so was the food nice and hot. Also the mustard sauce helped unplug my husband left feeling better."}
{"text":"Easily the worst Popeyes in the country. Way overpriced, poor quality food and staffed by nitwits. Pass this one by."}
{"text":"chicken at its finest!! i love popeyes because of  its fresh and hot chicken finally we have one in Greek Town yayyyy. service was good, staff was friendly i hope it stays like this."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service ! Always get burnt chicken. Not taken serious. Employees seem to always be messing around. Not impressed with this Popeyes."}
{"text":"Stopped in here the other night after a long day of traveling and was shocked to find out that after paying a premium for all white meat that I had to pay an additional charge for breasts... Apparently, you only get 2 in an 8 piece order and they want to \"up charge\" for more. When did that start? It used to be half and half, I guess not any more. 
Then the manager preparing my order had to call me up and ask me what my side was. Then... She served it to me to fine in when I asked for it to go... Then... She out it in a box and said here ya go! I said are my jalapeño's there? And she said, OH and then out 3 in a \"little\" bag and set them on top of the box. I had to then ask for a bag so they didn't fall out as I left. 
The last time I was here, I ordered all white and when I got home, I discovered that it was mixed with dark meat. 
Needless to say, I will never visit this location again and would rate the Zero Stars if it was possible..."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and location was clean. Food could have been better. Really dont see what people rave about.

Had 3 pc chicken with biscuit and mash potatoes, not crazy about cajun gravy that the mash potatoes are topped with. Biscuit did not seem fresh, broke apart easy in crumbs. Chicken was ok, prefer KFC.


My boyfriend had spicy chicken, which apparently was not spicy. He ordered fries which he said were decent, but rice and beans he would not recommend."}
{"text":"I have been here many times. The past experience was not very pleasant. I received my food and after looking at it I found a long strand of hair in my chicken. I did bring it back and they replaced it along with a complimentary dessert. While eating I did notice only 1 of the many actually had some sort of device to cover their hair. I thought it is a law to deal with food preparation to have that especially the people preparing the food. Who knows what is in the batter. Needless to say I won't be going back for a while."}
{"text":"My fried chicken was overly cooked... Actually, to be honest, it was burnt. There were bits of char on my pieces of chicken. I don't think I'll be buying anymore fried chicken from this Popeye's restaurant. Their red beans with rice was good, though. And, I've never had issues with their coleslaw. Their biscuits are okay, I guess - nothing particularly special about them."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the worst Popeye's that I have ever visited across multiple states. I keep returning, hoping that the service and food will be better, but it has not improved. This time, they gave me the wrong order (mixed instead of the dark that I ordered) and the chicken was small and overcooked. In a market where Bojangles is the clear and deserved leader, you'd expect a newcomer to do better or try much harder."}
{"text":"The food was hot and tasty. The service was very fast.  I never been to this one before but I will definitely be coming back again. The reason why I only gave it four starts was because the employees are a bit unprofessional."}
{"text":"The service here could use some work. There's always a communication barrier.  And at one point, they ran out of biscuits. (?!?!?!?!) How does a place called Popeye's Chicken and BISCUITS run out of biscuits?! That's poor planning on the manager's part."}
{"text":"This place really sucks. Been here a few times and always disappointed. Just seems like they are more interested in their conversations than the customers. Food is skinny tenders, sauce may or may not be in the bad. Only the biscuits are good."}
{"text":"I wanted to order from Popeyes over by Dawes Road as I know the chicken is very good there and the staff are pretty good.  So I sent my Brother out for it over to Danforth Ave and Dawes Road but he went over to the store over at Danforth Ave and Logan ave.

When he returned twenty minutes later we opened the Fries and Chicken and it was cold and it was so greasy it pooled in the bottom of the box.

I immediately picked up the phone to call the store about the lousy mess the food was in.  That's when he told me he picked it up at the Logan Ave. store and that's when I knew that it was par for the course when dealing with the Popeyes at Logan Ave. The food it seems is continually BAD, DRY, GREASY."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I got a chicken tenders combo and upgraded my Cajun rice to large. Much to my dismay, when I opened the container when I got home it was only filled halfway. They cheated me of the $2 that I paid for the upgrade. Lesson learned: check your food before you leave. Better yet, don't go to this place. Jesus, I hope you're happy with my $2."}
{"text":"Food is good, but the customer service and management has a lot to be desired for. I waited at least five minutes as the only person in line while everyone behind the counter was doing other things. Not one person said anything. There wasn't even a car in the Drive-Thru.
I placed my order which came pretty quick, however I ordered spicy chicken and they gave me plane. The fries were cold, and when I went to get an iced tea they had switched the sweet tea and the non sweet tea containers. When I told the person behind the counter about it they said \"oh yeah we already know, just poor yours out and get another one\".   I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Love the food, but my advice if you're taking out, check your order before you leave!! They NEVER get it right. Three times in a row they leave out sides and desserts. I mean seriously, how hard is it to look at a list and put everything on the list in a bag????? I wanted all legs in my order and agreed to a 14 minute wait, no problem ... But that turned into 35 minutes!!!! Took me less time at the doctors office!"}
{"text":"We had never been to Popeyes and decided to give it a try. The service was horrible. We waited almost 30 minutes for our food.  They ran out of chicken and once the chicken was done, they were out of potatoes. Very unorganized staff.  Once we finally got our order we completely anticipated cold, dry chicken but the chicken was still hot and moist and very flavorful.  Not sure it was worth \"waiting 30 minutes\" good, but it was ok."}
{"text":"Wicked good deal still up on the menu and isn't being honored, false advertising! Don't keep it up and tell customers no, find a way to take it down first. Should be an obvious concept, very disappointing."}
{"text":"This is the worst chicken I ever eat. Meal was cold ,fries is hard .we ask for hot they said it takes another 30 min. They give me wrong meal and for fix I should wait 10 min. And they just say she is a new employee!!also for the 5 pieces wings they give us 4 in each order!!"}
{"text":"This Popeyes is not the best one around. Made me sick off the mayo in the delta mini once."}
{"text":"Poor customer service from this restaurant that shares space with a Circle K. Chicken was flavorless and some pieces were over cooked. Our order took nearly 15 minutes to put together because they were filling other orders while they waited for enough fries to complete our order. They did offer compensation but only after we complained about the six counter orders they filled while we waited. We have no idea how many drive thru orders were filled in that time frame. We used to think customer service was poor in New Jersey. The greater Phoenix area is worse by far."}
{"text":"I am so happy Popeyes in my neighborhood. Been twice since they opened. Extremely well managed, courteous staff and delish chicken. Definitely one of our neighborhood \"go to\" stores."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend a week or so ago and the customer service was good the food was good maybe a little pricey but definitely worth it. I would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location drive thru twice. Both times very friendly and food hot and delicious!  I sure hope the service continues this way. I will be back."}
{"text":"One word HORRIBLE! The first time i went drive thru which was about a month ago,  i ordered mashed potatoes but NO spoon or napkins! Wtff! U expect me to eat mashed potatoes with my hands?!? i work as a driver so u can imagine how hard that was. The drive thru girl was so eager to talk to her coworkers that she messed up my order. I dont mind if u enjoy yourself at work but make sure u get your job done correctly. 
2nd time i ordered mashed potatoes and they gave me spoon but with cold FRENCH FRIES! 1 task! And they couldnt even do that. They should all be fired or retrained. Nothing pisses me off more then having my order wrong! -1 star

Ps this place sucks ballz im pissed"}
{"text":"This popeye's is near my house so I figured I'd check it out. The food was good, like every other popeye's. My gripe is with the service. I have visited 3 times and THREE times they got my order wrong. Missing a dressing, unsweetened tea instead of sweet tea, not spicy tenders instead of spicy. Ok, fine, not a big deal. But when I went back to have the order corrected I was met w such attitude it was unbelievable! I wasn't asking for anything other than the order that I had paid for. This location is 0/3. Nope won't be back!"}
{"text":"Tried to get some apple pies. It's PI day 3.14 and no pies! Sitting waiting 7+ minutes for pies and listening to the lady in the drive-thru advise it's going to be a 15-35 minute wait for orders. It's ridiculous! No wonder Popeye's are closing down! I'm sure this and Durango location will be next 2 victims!"}
{"text":"It was a great meal I actually think that POPEYES LOISANNA KITCHEN is the best for chicken"}
{"text":"Food: excellent. 
The reason this place does not get 5 stars is because of the service. 
It's a fast good restaurant. 
If it is crowded then it is down to your luck that you get food in under 10 mins. 
They can't handle large crowds sometimes. 
Which is never good. 
The home delivery service takes ages! 
I had to wait an hour for my order. And I live on a 15 minute walk from the place! 
Some of the staff is really good. 
Like I said, the food is amazing. 
However, I can't help but think that it may be a little overpriced. 
It would be awesome if they could lower the prices a tad more and have better customer service"}
{"text":"Great service it has improved their service. Great staff and food is fresher now. Good job"}
{"text":"The food is consistent and fast.  Stop here every few weeks flying through

Get the same meal.  With a cup of ice water.  This time lady says we don't serve water we don't have a fountain???

I did not even say you did 5 days ago.   Just won't stop back   By the way 5 days ago my 3 piece meal had 2 pieces.   

Not out to pleased a customer I'll move on to the next place."}
{"text":"Avoid the drive thru if you can. You'll get stuck in a long line and can't get out. It may look like the line is short, but there a lot of cars usually behind the building especially in rush hour. they would probably rake in a lot more money if they had someone taking orders outside like other stores do.  I'll probably go back on me when its not busy."}
{"text":"They try really hard to stay consistent but the level of service drops every time I come they are out of something. Simple things like Lemonade...Cocktail Sauce. U really want to believe in the new effort to revamp Popeyes but what happened to th excitement everybody had when the store opened"}
{"text":"So, we went through the drive thru and they rushed us through, didn't listen to our full order, made us pull around to the side, didn't give us all our food, and my boyfriend ended up having to go inside to make our own drinks and get our sauces and our side of mac and cheese. Never coming to this location again."}
{"text":"Take 30 minutes to take a dam order out so rude too it's ridiculous. They're manager was on the phone the whole time"}
{"text":"Love the chicken, but the health department needs to see if this place is sanitized...last two visits was disappointing... $9 +$ for chicken bones... I got the last of the spicy... got two wings, one thigh...SAD... told cashier...\"Sorry, that's all we have right now.\"  frustration led me to leave food on counter..."}
{"text":"I am very pleased to see more and more different places for me to choose from in my neighborhood. 

I love Popeyes and my favorite would have to be the spicy chicken and mashed potato & gravy.

The employees were super friendly and the place was very clean!"}
{"text":"Food is ok but this restaurant is FILTHY! No matter what you do, DO NOT look at the floor. I am not sure how it could be so nasty considering they just opened. I called the manager and told him how my shoes stuck to the tile and he said he would do something. He didn't. If the floor is filthy and that is easy to see and fix, how clean is the rest of the restaurant?"}
{"text":"Not happy. Always short of chicken... can't even trust them. I have to count my order before leaving. Today I'm not happy about it- got home and short of order again. S"}
{"text":"I really love Popeyes they have excellent food. But the one on bonanza has the worst customer service especially the drive thru girl her name is Kenia. She has the worst attitude and the worst customer service. I asked for a drink holder she threw down my straws and rolled her eyes because I asked for a drink holder. I hope they find professional employees for their establishment. Because she is worst employee on the one on bonanza specially that drive thru girl."}
{"text":"Foods great, service is non existent. Does this place have management. Makes you want to never come back! Stop running commercials and spend that money training and recruiting good people!"}
{"text":"Popeyes is one of my favorite places but the staff at this location is a joke. Got dinner for the family, drove home to find my order was missing an entire meal. Drove back and walked in with my receipt and got nothing but an additude from the young girl. She admitted to bagging it and acted like I was making it up to get more food. Instead of being apologetic she was rude and obnoxious. Won't be back here..."}
{"text":"Bad drive-thru service. Work on listening to your customers and not interrupting them when they order. Shitty overall"}
{"text":"The last time I came to this location a couple  months ago I had a terrible experience and posted a review blasting the service and management but I just went again yesterday and had a much different experience and thought it was only fair.

It's obvious that management is reading their reviews and taking appropriate steps to correct their shortcomings in service. This time, there was a new employee taking orders with an experienced employee looking over his shoulder. They were taking orders quickly and correctly and the orders were ready within 5 mins. The employees were very polite greeting everyone as they entered and thanking everyone as they left. 

The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because they no longer sell red sticks which were my favorite and their chicken is just so-so."}
{"text":"There service sucks, we order two five piece mild chicken tenders, but instead they gave us spicy, the sweet tea was water with a hint of tea flavor, the tenders were rubbery and cold with a lot  of breading on it with little meat, so we are not going to them any more, and these people want 15 dollars an hour at fast food & can't even get the orders right, also they gave us the wrong dipping sauce all together, need better managers to run this place..."}
{"text":"This is a horribly run Popeye's.  If you want something to drink besides the giant Freestyle Coke machine, like sweet or unsweetened tea, good luck to you.  Both times I've been in the tea dispensers have been empty; does anyone ever check them? The wait time for food is way too long for a fast food establishment.  You'd do better going to Bojangles, at least they do the southern chicken concept better."}
{"text":"This is the last time I eat at this Popeyes location:( I waited almost 15 minutes in the drive thru and ordered the 5 piece tenders combo.  10 bucks for old tenders that weren't spicy( I ordered the spicy) and the mashed potatoes had hardly any gravy also the sweet tea was not even sweet!! And to think after 10 minutes I was about to leave but I was sandwich between the cars.  Customer service is non existent and they are always hiring new people.  It's a shame I use to love Popeyes in Cali.  Oh well glad we have alternatives!"}
{"text":"Sooo happy to have Poppeyes in my hood! I was surprised to see the negative comments. Every time I've been there (drive-thru) the service has been great. The order has been right. And they are fast!!"}
{"text":"Service is really bad. today is Fri only 2 people serving at the counter. Shop full. Waited for 30 minutes"}
{"text":"The service stinks.  Waiting only to find out you have the wrong order.  They have a sign at the Drive Thru to have your money ready....my suggestion is have the chicken ready"}
{"text":"This place is bad even by fast food standards. It seems that more times than not they find a way to mess up the order. Haven't been there in a while until about 20 minutes ago. Decided to go in and order to go instead of drive thru to avoid errors. I guess I should've opened every box and checked before I left. I ordered and paid for a 12 piece meal with mash taters and Cajun rice which comes with 6 biscuits. Got home and opened up to 8 pieces, no rice, and 4 biscuits. The place wasn't even busy. The guy repeated my order back to me. I just don't understand this kind of incompetence. One time is a mistake. But this has been over and over and over. Good lord."}
{"text":"Horrible service and they got the order wrong. After going back to complain the manager decided to argue with me.

The manager said the employee was only trying to save us money. 

Managers don't need to give excuses. They refunded our money and asked us to return the food so they can throw it away. 

Then the employee came and told us that her paycheck was getting docked for our meal. 

Smdh"}
{"text":"I would go here more often if I was given more then $5 for dinner I am sick of crap Donald's for dinner.  The only thing I think they need to do to improve is provide wifi and maybe lower the price on there drinks and food."}
{"text":"Great Chicken Hot and Juicy! Tenders not as juicy as Chicken but that's normal. Shrimp is yummy. Great varieties of sauces. If you like Chicken this is the place. Excellent location. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Good chicken - well cooked and what I expect from Popeye's... BUT - they completely forgot to put in the biscuits in my combo - huge disappointment! Also, the staff seemed completely unengaged - only one person (out of three) doing any work (both taking the order and fulfilling it). Concerned about hygiene based on the lackadaisical attitude of the staff."}
{"text":"Make sure and leave yourself an extra 15-20 minutes at this \"fast food\" restaurant. Service is terribly slow."}
{"text":"I am giving this one star, only because it was edible. Barely. I have definitely been to better Popeyes.  Chicken was cold and not tasty. I have been to other locations and was very sayisfied. I guess when hungry you'll eat anything,  well almost, I didn't even finish half of my meal. It was horrible. The only up side, the sweet tea was good."}
{"text":"I LOVE fried chicken.  The two KFCs near north Scottsdale have been closed for years, so we tried this place for the first time.  We won't be going back.  We ordered a lot of the mild real chicken pieces with several sides. I will say it was crunchy.  But it's hard to cook anything so bland and tasteless. Mild does not mean without salt or spices, just not cayenne pepper or tobasco. While holding a piece in my hand, the grease actually dripped off onto my plate! I can just compare this to KFC which never dripped grease and the flavor made my mouth sing!  (Only problem is, it requires warming up when we get it home and that can dry it out.)The cole slaw was good, hubby liked the mashed potatoes and biscuits, but the red beans and rice was meh.  He's just not a fan, which is fine. Doesn't mean people who enjoy this will not like it here.  I was disgusted by the macaroni and cheese, which we ended up throwing out.  It had to be cheese product powder mixed with water.  Tasteless.  Kraft, in comparison, is gourmet!  So as not to have completely wasted our money, I'm going to pull off the greasy, tasteless skin and use the chicken making chicken and dumplings, chicken salad, and chicken pot pie."}
{"text":"Honestly the worst Popeyes I've ever been too. The reason this review gets a star is because of the food. The employees here are high school drop outs, they gotten my orders wrong from the moment I started eating at this place. They never get my order right, even McDonald gets my order right on the first try. Honestly I'm never eating here again..."}
{"text":"Where did the quality go? What's famous about the company is that they focus so much when the store opens and fail to maintain that same care and attention to detail as their store attempts to grow, and in the end won't because consistency seems to be irreverent to upper management. Kirk T. however is a welcome sight and always makes sure our food is hot and fresh, which is why I gave two stars. Will be back again to review in a month to see if they give the guy any help."}
{"text":"Ordered a Deluxe chicken sandwich platter (fries and mashed potatoes as the sides) but was extremely disappointed with the service. The amount of fries was as little as what you would get if you buy a small size. They dared put the mashed potatoes container in the same plate as the fries to fill in the space. So I asked if we weren't supposed to get more fries because the platter comes with regular fries and not small, and they just took out the mashed potatoes container, put it in a different bag (because I said that's not supposed to be in the fries plate) and they were done with me.

Never going there again. 

They have no respect for customers, also for giving less than what we pay for."}
{"text":"Horrible service had to wait 35 mins for a 3 piece meal. And the workers where so rude... no customer service skills at all... I guess that is what you get when you let kids run your food chain."}
{"text":"I went to Krispy Kajun (\"KJ\") recently and that was good and I wanted to compare it to Popeyes'. I had the Thursday 3 piece special. I thought it was $4.99, but it is $5.29 now. I thought the chicken at KJ place was excellent and I really could not tell any noticeable difference between that place and here.
The chicken was piping hot, crispy and juicy. It was just as good as KJ yet the former gets rave reviews. One thing to look at is the price point. KJ is 3.99 vs 5.29 for 3 pieces on a Thursday, so one would be paying 32% more. Also, I cannot be certain buy I hypothesize that if you eat at KJ 100 times, 75 might be excellent, 20 might be very good, and just 5 okay; I believe that Popeyes numbers would be worse. Other reviews besides mine show consistency issues found in any particular store. There is quality issues in one restaurant and even more so from restaurant to restaurant. It is not hard to imagine a mom and pop shop that is dedicated to quality outperforming a chain.
Yet, the time I went, it was excellent.

4 stars

I never crave Cajun chicken but if I do, I'll save some money and play the odds and go to KJ even if a Popeyes is a little closer."}
{"text":"Guys this is one of the best Popeyes I have ever experienced!!!!! I was always a big fan of Popeyes but sadly my love for It was taken away by some other stores in the market as their service was pretty bad, chicken was not fresh or they were not up to the mark.But since I startred to visit this Popeyes, everything has changed.

The service is really incredible and the staff is really nice. The chicken is always fresh and their Chicken Sandwich is something me and my friends really relish.
Seriously recommended"}
{"text":"Drive past here everyday. Finally had time to stop. Manager very disorganized. Got what I ordered and then some. Had to ask for my drink cup. Not offered butter or honey. 

I love Popeyes but this place doesn't do the brand any justice. Arrived at 1pm took 10 minutes to order and no one in front of me. Chicken tastes good but is dryed out and not moist."}
{"text":"After ousting KFC from my chicken menu when they decided to disgrace the colonel's recipe, I have been desperate to find a decent chicken place.
I have always liked Popeye's but this location is making it too difficult. This goes specifically mention the lack of proprietorship that I have experienced in my last 3 visits.  
The first of these 3 visits is not having product ready in such an under-demanding hour- 3:30 PM is ample of enough time to recover from a lunch hour and to begin work-ups for the dinner rush. But not for me. I had to wait for biscuits because their inability to foresee that they would be open.
The 2nd of these visits, they had run out of product for their Dippin' Chicken promotion.
The 3rd visit, they had the chicken for the promotion, but they were out of the sauce.
Please, if this is a corporate store, consider me for managing this location. People are looking for work, and at least with me, you won't have these problems. Or at least hire someone who that who can upkeep the company image and maximize the potential of this location. It seems like these guys are all good when they get their pay checks but when it comes to providing service to the people, they have questions they can't answer. Maybe get the guys from Sahara and Jones to teach them, cuz they're good."}
{"text":"Craving for Popeyes chicken, no question ask for expected crispiness and Louisiana taste of Chicken, unfortunately, one of the staff was rude. Was so disappointed, is that how we called \"customer service\" I do understand if she's tired or having a bad day, but it's not acceptable how she served!"}
{"text":"Found hair in my food, returned it, asking for some without hair. Received no apologies, nothing, just biscuit handed to me. Will never return. Service was also quite slow and rude."}
{"text":"smart move on there part to bring it near the school but i miss it near hy10 all well all i can say is i missed the wicked chicken omg i love that its so pack i will always go there fck the bootleg quick chik close soon"}
{"text":"Horrible place. Never went to popeys before so I hope the othera are better. staff was unfriendly but the quality of the food was worse. I had the popcorn shrimp. It was a lot shrimp but it tasted very old and overcooked. I dont know how long ago that stuff was fried. I was already afraid to be sick later when I ate it and I didnt have to wait for 20 minutes till my stomach was hurting. I had to chancel my trip at the strip way earlier than planned because I needed badly a toilet and went back to the hotel. was at the toilet for 20 minutes. didnt feel that bad for years. Never again"}
{"text":"Came in with 1 person in front of us ordering, another 2 already ordered and were waiting for their food. It seems like they priorities the drive thru more than their customers staying inside.. We waited more than 20 mins. for our food to arrive! Quite a wait for a fast food. Unbelievable!!! Upleasant staff looking so confuse, frustrated, lazy and unattentive. They even left the garbage unattended just openly on the way of the entrance. It's been untouched since we arrived and left the place. Worst worst worst"}
{"text":"I love Popeyes. Just not this one. Came in ordered 2 kids meals my 3 pice meal and popcorn shrimp for my lady. 3 min later all but the shrimp are ready. We eat and almost done when they bring the so call shrimp. All that wait for this see the photo. Not to mention we asked for the shrimp and the cashier said its almost out. But did not check, the shrimp had been sitting in the warmer for about 2 min before he got it. And told us the shrimp is ready. He did apologize for the wait but still wifey had to eat all by herself."}
{"text":"Being from New Orleans I grew up on Popeyes and was excited to see them moving into the market. 
I recently went to the location on albamarle Rd for lunch and was very unsatisfied with my experience. I ordered red beans and rice and a biscuit. When I got home I found the bowl was only about 2/3 full and was nothing but rice. Barely enough beans to change the color of the rice , not even enough to taste the beans. 
Again , I grew up in New Orleans , the place Al Copeland started the concept , so I know this is not right. 
I called the customer service line and the lady took my info and told me it would be forwarded. A week later I called back to find out why no one had followed up with me and was told I didn't ask for contact!  

Why on Earth would I call to report the issue and give my phone number home address and  email address if I didn't want to be contacted. 

AND STILL NO CONTACT FROM POPEYES! 

$4 for a cup and a half of white rice and I'm now a former Popeyes customer. Great service skills guys."}
{"text":"Food - made fresh and hot. Never been disappointed with this chain and the food

Service - mediocre. Popeye's delivers. When we asked for a delivery at noon, they said they couldn't and that we had to pick up. Make your own opinion on this scenario.

Location: brutal. Traffic is always packed on yonge."}

{"text":"PEDOPHILES AND IMMATURE CASHIERS WORK HERE

Me and my friend used to always go here and one day the hijabi women with the nose piercing asked my friend for her name and age, then called her pretty which was sweet(I wasnt there). Another time, me and my friend went, the women said hi to my friend, we ordered then sat down in the corner away from sight. She then yelled \" ****** your food is ready\", which was weird, but i guess since the women knew my friend, she yelled my friends name.I went to pick up both orders, the women saw it was only me and quickly took the drinks off the tray. I put the drinks back on the tray but then she rudely grabbed them off and said bring your friend to grab the drinks, I was weirded out but i thought since my friend also wore a hijab and was pretty, the women thought she might be a good match for her son thats probably why she likes my friend so much (my friends thought that too). I went and told my friend and she was so uncomfortable. Today we went again with another friend and the women said Salmaaannn to a man in the back and nodded to my friend. Salman came out to stare at my friend and it was a FORTY year old balding bearded man.There was another female working there and the women told her in Urdu \"Thats the girl that salman wants\". First of all this isn't elementary school where you do these dumb things to make my friend show her face or yell Salmannn and whisper about crushes. Second of she knows my friend is 16 and thats disgusting to encourage an underage girl with a man who probably has kids older than my friend.


Another incident is the men who work their always ask how old I am, where I'm from , whats my name and stare at me in this creepy manner and once i went to buy myself something small and the man said why don't you buy the meal and i told him i only have a 5 and hes like its ok I'll pay for it and instead of calling out my order he came to my table gave me my food and said \" You should be happy I gave you this meal free\". I did not beg for the meal, I was initially gonna buy some chicken and he did a nice favour, but then saying I should be happy Go Fuck yourself"}
{"text":"I love popeyes chicken because of the Cajun spices and this is my go to restaurant as it's the closest to where I live but at times they do disappoint 
1. Agree with someone else who wrote chicken isn't as spicy or well seasoned as Popeyes is supposed to be (hand the tenders the other day and were bland)
2. Service - sometimes there is a delay as the server is confused to what u want - I wouldn't hold this against the restaurant but would help fast service and guidance when needed 
3. $0 charge for paper bag (for ur popeyes sandwich) but $0.05 cents for plastic bag to stuff 3 boxes of chicken and fries in it - doesn't make sense (it's not like I'm visiting Loblaws and have brought my own shopping bag / cart to carry out my popeyes chicken!)"}

The chicken taste a little bit better I don't know if they have better Refrigeration or what. But this Popeye's Chicken is a lot better than the one they had at the little rinky dinky gas station."}

I mean, it's a chain so I feel like you know what to expect. The employees are sometimes a little less than friendly, shall we say. But honestly, I don't go to Popeyes for the atmosphere (no offense Popeyes). I go to get some cheap, delicious fried chicken and then head the heck home so I can eat it in the privacy of my sweatpants. 

You know what I'm talking about ..."}
{"text":"Giving one star is too much when they really should be getting 0 stars. My coworker and I were just there, and we were waiting in the drive-thru for 25min. Making us late for work.

{"text":"This is the worst Popeye's EVER! It is beyond nasty on the inside. The only reason I go is because my husband likes the hit-or-miss chicken. I refuse to eat there myself.

On this visit, the soda cup and two different soda flavors dripping down the sides. I asked Corinna for a napkin to wipe it off. She proceeded to attempt to wipe it off with one hand while expecting me to continue to hold the cup out of my car window. I eventually put it on the window shelf. She continued to try to wipe it off with ONE HAND. She handed it back to me half-clean, at which point I just took it and drove off in disbelief at such laziness. I also had to repeat my order to her several times. It was a simple three-piece combo, red beans and rice, and a Coke. The chicken was not fresh when my husband opened the box at home. Pathetic."}

I wouldn't go there again."}

If you are going to go here make sure you check exactly what is in your bag before driving away. Terrible Service. Incompetent Staff. They did offer me a refund if I brought the food back which I did not have time to do and they did offer to replace my order which is good but they seem to be better at offering refunds and replacements than getting the order right in the first place."}
{"text":"This location is not typical of most Popeyes restaurants...unfortunately. We've been here about 3 times, and each time was similar in terms of the service, which is best described as underwhelming. It always takes a VERY long time to get the food, regardless of dine-in, take out or drive thru. The service is poor. Employees are not friendly and the speed is very slow. The best part is typically the food, but it should be since they appear to be making it to order. They need to work on the cleanliness, particularly the floors, which are filthy. Cleaning items were left in the open, too. YUK! Lastly, on the recent visit, the person who appeared to be the manager got into an argument with me over the price of items and a promotion. I was not happy being charged what equated to $5 for a chicken tender, and he didn't appreciate it. Oh well....there are better options for me to spend $40 for 4 people."}
{"text":"The staff at this location tonight was friendly and courteous. They smiled and laughed and chatted with us as we waited for our food. 
The location was clean and tidy and of course the food was good. But I really wanted to compliment the employees for their positive attitudes tonight. Thanks for a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Well let's see. It's now 1:24pm, and I paid for my food and was asked to \"please pull around and we'll bring you your food in just one second\" at 1:03pm. I'm still sitting here. And so are the other not one, not two, but THREE cars who were apparently told the same thing. 

UPDATE: At long last, and 34 minutes later, my food is here! I can only assume they had to lay the egg, hatch, bring up, kill, de-feather, bread, fry, and box my chicken.  Like others have said, the food is actually quite tasty. However, waiting 34 minutes in a drive through? You HAVE to be kidding me. I really hope the management reads these reviews and does something to remedy the problem. 

Again. Good FOOD.  

God awful, embarrassingly bad, comical but not in a good way, please someone fix this train wreck/dumpster fire SERVICE. 

And to top it off, no refund or mention of anything to say \"sorry\" for this ridiculously bad service. 

The good news is, whoever manages this place could do a bang up job at the DMV, if chicken doesn't work out..."}
{"text":"I ordered Spicy five piece tenders combo, yesterday on 8/20.

The first problem I ran into was when they gave me my food 3 seconds after I had just ordered. But they didn't give me the dipping sauces I asked for. So I had to stand there like an asshole and ask for my dipping sauces again. 

Order food and get it 3 seconds later? That should have tipped me off before the next thing happened.

The Tenders were Raw. RAW. They were still fucking clucking. Nice and Crispy on the outside and Blue rare on the inside. That can be okay for some steak. But never chicken. Ever.

Do you know how disgusting it is to bite into under/uncooked chicken? Absolutely revolting. I almost puked right there in the restaurant. 

I showed the manager the slimy translucent chicken and he would not admit it was raw but he did refund my money.

I have had the same experience with the Spicy tenders being under cooked at other locations as well(Jones and Sahara). Why the fuck is it so hard to cook spicy tenders?

When they are cooked correctly they are awesome. Get your shit together Popeye's."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. On every occasion, i would enter, place my order, and as if I my order consist of something funny, the cashier and the guys at the back would communicate silently and non verbally, then looked at me at chuckle. This happens so many times I stop going to that location.  Popeyes is a franchise so no matter which location u go to, the quality of food should be consistent .
Why can't they jsut serve without judging customers??"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Popeye's.  This is the very first time I had Popeye's chicken.  My uncle took me here for a quick lunch when I went to visit.  I was quite excited since there was no Popeye's at the time in my area.  Yay for Popeye's Chicken... although I don't have it anymore because it's a bit well, greasy."}
{"text":"Bought 10 pcs chicken and they run out of ketchup packet. Also cashier wasn't paying attention, he gave me wrong change.. bad experienced"}
{"text":"I'm giving this Popeyes 4 stars in hopes that it stays in business. I grew up with Popeyes and have always loved the place. I will say that this location is a bit skimpy on the sides, unfortunately. My red beans and rice were filled just halfway up the cup. I will be back for the great flavors and close proximity, I can only hope that they get better."}
{"text":"There's better quality food elsewhere. The chicken was SO greasy, like hands drenched and dripping down my arms greasy. I know this is a fast food joint and food is a hit or miss, but this was a little overwhelming.

The biscuit was the most saddest little undercooked thing I've ever seen. If it could cry, it would, and it would say 'please bake me longer'. It wasn't even a nice golden brown like it should have been. Super disappointing. The only ok thing about this Popeyes was the fries. Yeah. The fries.

The customer service was good though, the gentleman at the counter was very polite and nice, so I give him a 5 in customer service but for food, a -1. If you have low standards for your fast food; this place is for you!"}
{"text":"I have been to various popeye and this outlet did not make the cut. The chicken tasted stale and in a 12 family meal, I got very small wings. Very poor quality and value, very unlike other outlet I been too. Totally disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was horrible, catfish tasted like dirt.
Service was slow and they didn't give us forks for our Togo order."}
{"text":"Mom bro and myself digg there fish and chips; sides are alright with the corn and spicy fries. You know you can find better places for fish and chips like Red Lobster, not bad."}
{"text":"Garbage place. My chicken was undercooked. Order took to long. Asked to eat in and they gave me my food in a bag and put that on a tray. Only reason it deserves a star is because I wasn't hungry afterwards."}
{"text":"You've had the chicken I'm sure.. 

In this review I want to mention to a new item on the Popeyes Value Menu called the Chicken Biscuit - it's damn delicious, cheap and fulfils your sinful cravings. 

The sandwich is made with slices of fried chicken tenders (white meat) and sandwiched between a buttermilk biscuit,  Voila!  There you have it  the Popeye's Chicken Biscuit for $1.99! Genius, pop a couple of these back and you're good to go. 


Oh an honourable mention if you're feeling for dessert..

Popeyes is one of the few places that offers a fried apple pie.  So good if you hadn't had one before.. the apple sauce is ooey gooey but bite carefully because the hot apple sauce can burn your mouth.. it's very hot out of the frier..  the crust of the pie is crisp to perfection& tastes nothing like a baked pie. Back in the day they used to coat it with sugar and cinnamon for extra goodness. Not any more.. guess they are getting soft. 

I give props to Popeyes for sticking to their heritage of offering tasty and delicious fatty fast foods that don't give a flying f**k about your health."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best red beans and rice. Closest to homemade I have had. Airport treat!!"}
{"text":"First, I love Fried Chicken. The food is good and this new building is beautiful and clean.

I rate the score down due to the service in the restaurant itself. I have been here 5-6 times now and the employees all seem 'new'. Never has someone rung up my order without having to question someone else on how to do it. Never have we gone there when they weren't 'out' of something I wanted to order. Just last Saturday night, we went into the dining room at 8:30 at night. Half of the dining room was cleaned up already and blocked off. By the time we left at 9:00pm, the soda machines had been torn apart for cleaning and we couldn't refill our drinks. Come on, the place is OPEN until 10:00pm, be fully OPEN."}
{"text":"The food is always good but today the service reached a new low. They messed up my order by giving me chicken meals instead of chicken tender meals. Of course i had to turn around and drive all the way back to get what I ordered. The red headed girl who seemed to be a manager was completely rude. She never said she was sorry, questioned if it was me who has misordered, and had the AUDACITY to actually try to bill me for the $5 difference in overall price. After messing up my order and wasting my time and gas to drive back. I would have expected a CREDIT of some kind for the poor service. Nope! This moron's solution was to try to charge me MORE. This will be the last time my family or my business eats at this location. If i could give the service a -5 I would!!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review because their service sucks. I purchased 9 chicken wraps specifically asked for sauce. It is not rocket science to put the sauce in the bag it is what they do for a living why ask me is there anything else I need at the end of my order and I tell them and you do not put it in the bag. I was able to get a ten minute break to run across the street to purchase lunch there is no way that I can go back to get the sauce and the manager that was on duty could not help me maybe they need to send the managers to a little more training on customer service and on how to put things in the bag."}
{"text":"My family and I are from Louisiana, so I decided to take them to Popeye's to get a little 'taste of home.' We were treated very poorly while we were placing our order, and the order taker could barley even speak, yet he treated us like we were stupid. We ordered a 16 piece white meat and were told we would have to wait 20 minutes for our food, so we paid and pulled up. We were waiting in the parking lot for 45 minutes before I decided to go inside and see what was going on. Turns out they hadn't even cooked our chicken and had completely forgotten we were even there. The girl told me she had to have my receipt to prove we had paid for our food, even though there's no way she didn't remember us, since she took our payment, and we were literally the only customers there the entire time. I went back to the car, got the receipt, went back to give it to her, but she refused to even look at it and just started throwing chicken into a box and told me \"Don't worry, I got you\" in a very sarcastic voice. I decided to ignore it and just took my food home, because we were starving after waiting almost an hour for our order. We arrive back at my house only to realize that instead of our 16 piece, we were only given a 12. I decided I'd call the store in the morning to get a refund for the chicken we hadn't received. As I was eating a piece of the chicken, I tasted something that tasted like some form of chemical, so I spit out what I hadn't already swallowed. 15 minutes after this I became extremely ill and began shaking and violently threw up. After I threw up all of the food I had eaten I was instantly better, so it is very clear that something in the chicken was very wrong. Not sure what the girl did to our food, but I will never return to this store, and I strongly advise everyone to avoid this restaurant at all costs."}
{"text":"We have heard many commercial on this place so we were out and decided to try it out. The chicken was crunchy and I enjoyed the spice. The wife said the potatoes tasted like instant potatoes. The gravy they offered made it better tho. The rice and beans mix was good too. I wouldn't recommend getting any of the teas. I would more than likely return tho."}
{"text":"I have been there many times before in the drive-through each time I ordered takes 10 minutes I have to get out and go in and ask them what happened they don't speak English"}
{"text":"Iv been going here in the evenings lately and it's been consistently good which is unlike most Popeyes locations. I get the chicken sandwich which they almost always make to order so it's hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Don't go there. I hope they get a health inspection. I opened my box and there were half chicken strips that looked dried out on the ends and looked like leftovers."}
{"text":"Here's the thing. Reading through all these reviews, it sounds like people are expecting to have a great customer service experience... at a national chain fast food restaurant. I get it, everyone wants to be an important special snowflake and have their butts wiped by their waitstaff. But you know what? Get over yourselves. No decent person cares that the service isn't phenomenal. It's fast food. 

In fact, the entire point is for it to prioritize speed and efficiency and economy with \"good enough\" food and service. If someone on either side of the counter starts holding up the line - which at this location during lunch rush can be grueling - that is what constitutes bad customer service. 

You go to a Popeye's, or any fast food chain for that matter, because you want the exact same food you had at any other location, you want it hot, and you want it quickly. That is the model which the entire fast food industry is based on. So, evaluating it by appropriate standards, and rating it for what it is; this Popeye's does a pretty good job. The chicken is freshly fried, the biscuits are soft and just a little crispy, the sides are all hot and taste reasonably fresh. 

The only thing that keeps me from giving five stars is that, well, it's no exceptional. But it's fast food. It doesn't have to be exceptional. It just has to be fast and be food."}
{"text":"Really sexy chicken. Cleanest Popeyes I have been to. The staff did a great job. Super stingy with the honey! Anyway it's about time north Scottsdale. Tired of driving south to get my Popeyes."}
{"text":"Food was prepared fast. My chicken bowl was nicely cooked. The manager however did lose his cool at a rude customer. He could have handled it better as swearing was unnecessary. But apart from that bit of commotion the overall experience here was great. I would recommend this Popeyes location to other people."}
{"text":"people who work here need more training. why I cannot order 6pcs of chicken tenders? it's just 3+3."}
{"text":"Drive by Popeyes many times but never stopped in until yesterday. I was very happy I stopped in. Great tasting food and pleasant employees."}
{"text":"Located in or at least attached to a gas station (this was a bit of a new concept to us) but none the less clean and friendly. The staff greeted us right away and were super friendly and you could tell they really enjoyed their jobs and stood behind the product they were selling. 

The chicken was wonderful! I happen to have a slight chicken skin obsession, often only eating the skin off the fried chicken. OMG! The spicy chicken skin was so crunchy and flavorful. I was in love! 

The meal cost us about $13 for two adults. Much better than dining on the strip that afternoon. We will visit Popeyes again during our next Vegas vacation."}
{"text":"The ONLY POPEYES in town that doesn't have the Tuesday special. You get 1 star for being a greedy franchise."}
{"text":"Literally the worst experience I've had at a fast food establishment. Monday night we decide to stop for something quick, we pull up to the drive thru, place our order only to pull up to the window to hear the cook yelling \"are you serious?! Now I have to make 8 tenders for a family meal?!\" So my fiancé and I decide to just get our money back since we seemed to be upsetting someone so much by forcing them to do their job. When we asked for our money back the manager came to the window and handed us the money back while rolling her eyes! I've been in the service industry for years and I can promise you that myself nor would my staff ever handle such a situation with such disrespect and ignorance. The only positive out of this experience was the kid that actually took our order, super polite, respectful, and had a sense of humor about the mess. Bottom line, there's plenty of Popeyes locations, DO NOT waste your time at this one."}
{"text":"Management does not honor the survey.  This manager, believes that the fine prints should be extended to limit the free part of the survey to not include her store.  The company survey team prevents anyone from visiting more than once every 30 days.  Yet, she stated that if you redeemed a survey, and then did a survey your are not allowed to purchase from the survey.  I did one more than 30 days ago, turned it in, my computer was free to do another survey because it was over 30 days, so I returned after the block was off my computer makes sense?  Not according to this manager.  Called the 1-800-Popeyes, and decided not to tell them anything about myself, because I am not going back ever, so anything free or offered to me would be worthless to me.  She would not tell me her bosses name or number.

I have been going to this chain for years, never meet someone so one-sided. Hope your store has a major issue because of her, maybe they will close."}
{"text":"My favorite was the popcorn chicken.. Omg pretty amazing. But the service was excellent. Thanks to our waitress Raquel.. Come see her... She's got such a ppls personality.."}
{"text":"I live the boneless chicken. Here and how there is a layer of hot sauce right under the breaded part of the chicken. I still dip it in hot sauce and ranch but I like the extra Cajun flavoring! This is literally my favorite food from here. The drive through is kind of a pain to get too, but the wait isn't too bad."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.
I had a craving for fried chicken on Wed night near closing (usually not the best time to get fresh hot food at any fast food joint). But the girl at the counter was very nice and helpful, the food was fresh, hot with no wait. We had the $5 special: 3 chicken strips, 2 sides, 1 biscuit. 4 stars because I was not thrilled with the slaw or rice- but it was a taste preference not quality issue. Hubby loved the mash potato and gravy. Chicken was crispy not greasy. Only 2 other customers inside - but long line at the drive thru. My suggestion - get out of your car and go inside to get your to go order."}
{"text":"Extremely slow and disorganized. Tons of staff and even more customers standing around waiting for their orders. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Whenever I have to do a lunch run, I always have a huge complicated order. I'm used to always getting an attitude from whomever is taking my order. But to my surprise today I was greeted with a very sweet and helpful voice, he repeated my order to me 2 times to make sure they had it right and again when I was paying for it. Thank you for your kindness Miguel, it is appreciated. Maybe the next time I go over there I could ask for you directly!"}
{"text":"The chicken was good, fried, if that's what you like. I wish they would have offed a baked chicken alternative. The side of Mac and Cheese was not very good. I think they could improve it."}
{"text":"While I generally enjoy a good pice of southern fried chicken from Popeye's, on this particular visit I was a little disturbed.  At the drive thru sat a middle aged gentleman who called himself \"Diamond.\"  Diamond demanded that I roll down my window so that he could tell me about his venture into the recording arts.  He then wanted to put a CD into my stereo to listen to while I ordered my food.

I declined, then he proceeded to MF me about not supporting artists and being a cheap ass because I didn't want to give him $5 for a CD that I have never heard.  I don't even particularly enjoy rap music.  

According to \"Diamond\" he has the permission of the manager to sell his wares.  If this is in fact true, I will not be going back.

FYI; The chicken was the bomb!"}
{"text":"never again
not only did they make me wait 1/2 for my order with no apology and no they weren't busy
they also got the order wrong too which I didn't realize until I had gotten all the way home
how can people eat this over salty fatty crap
that is half an hour and $12 I will never see again
I just threw the whole thing down the garbage chute
never again"}
{"text":"I just came here and found a feather in my chicken and the ladies at the counter were in the back on their phones and eating in the kitchen when I tried to get their attention. After I told one of them the situation she said it's normal and that it's not uncommon to find feathers in the chicken."}
{"text":"Tuesday specials. Two for 99 cents!!!!!! -leg and thigh. Wow...that is a great deal for me. My weekly fix for good fried chicken comes at s bargain. Make sure you do not let it get cold because it tastes the best fresh from the fryer."}
{"text":"Popeyes fried chicken is one of the best. I love how crispy the skin gets as soon as it is scooped out of the fryer. Right amount of heat and spices. The mild flavor is a bit boring. I always go for the leg and thigh special for 99 cents. Awesome deal! Do not forget the red beans and rice, mashed with gravy and buttery biscuits. Sometimes the sides cost more than the chicken. Make sure you take your daily dose of cholesterol pills (statins). Welcome, you are in deep fried heaven."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while due to bad service we received last time.  Went tonight got home and they forgot part of our order again!!!!  So annoying called them and told them we were missing part of the order and that I was coming back to get the rest.  Asked if they could refund me due to the inconvenience and was told they could not do that.  I just wanted to laugh at how bad the customer service is here."}
{"text":"I went to this location one time before and was so dissatisfied with the service I swore I wouldn't go back. That was years ago and since I live in the area I decided to give it another shot. The general disinterest the employees have in the customers really gets me. I pulled in the drive thru to place an order and was \"greeted\" with \"Thanks for choosing popeyes.\" No personality, very monotone and rushed. I needed a moment to decide what to order and told Robert (the young man working the window) that I needed a moment and would let him know when I'm ready. No one was behind me, there was no line, even the inside of the store was slow. He gave me about 30 seconds then rushed me to place my order. The only interest I see from these workers is to get me out of the drive thru. I placed my order and just like last time was given no total just simply told to pull up. Once there he ran my card, came out to a little over $20 as expected however it would have been nice to know what I was being charged. Once the money was spent he handed me my food and shut the window. Absolute worst customer service I've dealt with at a restaurant and I will NEVER be returning to this location. They need some sort of customer service training program or atleast hire better employees who make you feel appreciated rather than an inconvenience."}
{"text":"The girls that work early saturday evenings are adorable. My order was extremely particular (as I am picky) they gave me exactly what I asked for including plenty of sauces in a timely manner and even chatted Me up with delightful banter during My short wait. Glad this is My neighborhood popeyes!"}
{"text":"I ordered a 12pc spicy chicken dinner combo, w, dirty rice and jambalaya.  Then was told that I had to wait 25 minutes because I ordered spicy chicken. I actually went through the drive through that took another 20 minutes just to get to the order window.  Food is not bad, just takes forever but atleast you get freshly made chicken unlike KFC where the food sits there."}
{"text":"This place is going down hill fast.  We have been here several times,tonight is the last time we go there.
The place looks unkept,it looks old already and it's  a brand new building.
Some of the employees need to go to food handling school again.
  I truly appreciate a good, clean fast food restaurant with friendly service  , this is  not one of those."}
{"text":"Based on my experiences here, this restaurant changes the type of chicken they give in their dinners. 2pc and 3 pc chicken dinners come with one breast and a thigh or wing, right? That depends. Depending on who serves you or who the manager is at the time, they will try to give you all dark meat chicken. I even had one person tell me that it has always been that way."}
{"text":"For a so called Fast food restaurant, this is the slowest. They take your order and get your money before they tell you that you have to wait 15 min. They just throw the chicken in the fryer. Why don't they make it when they see that people are coming in and there's a line to buy their chicken. This the reason people come to buy here because it suppose to be fast. This is why the restaurant does not stay open long. People get tired of waiting. If I have to wait this long I would go to a fancy restaurant."}
{"text":"Have to say I was disappointed.  The staff seems to be lost. Food wasn't cold but it wasn't hot either. Ladies behind the counter were more in ti their gossip then the customers. ....pity ."}
{"text":"I eat at KFC every now and then, so I was expecting the same if not better at Popeyes in Vegas, though as soon as I walked in, the menu seemed disappointing, mainly because it lacked the wide variety of options I'm used to seeing.

Anyways I went for the simple chicken and biscuits, and it tasted just as such, chicken and biscuits, neither special, or terrible, just average, and given the prices, its not worth it at all. The Popeyes I went to regularly in Chicago makes this feel more like a dump then anything else. Customer service wasn't very good either.

As the 2 star rating notes, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple times, the first couple times I went there the service was ok and orders were wrong.  But the last couple times I have been back to this location have been great.  They obviously took these previous reviews to heart and have really turned the place into a solid joint.  The staff is very nice whenever I go in to the store."}
{"text":"I never intend to go here but I often get drawn in after shopping at Giant Eagle. I don't know why. I do enjoy the Popeye's spicy chicken and the mashed potatoes. One time they gave me a free drink because I had to wait so long for my order. And I love that they offer Strawberry Fanta!"}
{"text":"Over a 45 min wait on six pieces of chicken!!  I would rather drive to Craig Rd than to come back here."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss... I paid for 8 pieces of chicken and only got 7 pieces by the time I checked at home.  Also, the server says he gave 3 white pieces when in fact there were only 2 white pieces found.  I recommend dining in at this location otherwise make sure you double check your order before leaving this location."}
{"text":"So MAD I live almost across the street at UNLV been smelling this chicken forever! 
Go in there was cool ordering becuz I'm glad high off Tree that's why I went to begin with! 
So kray kray dude walked in and started yelling at everybody and I got this"}
{"text":"Always seems like I'm inconveniencing the employees here by coming an hour before they close. Tonight I asked for mild tenders... Pretty standard stuff. 

\"Don't have any.\"

No offer to make any. I said I wasn't going to order anything then.

\"Ok cool. Have a good night.\"

They always forget something when we order here, but we come because Popeyes has good chicken. My fat butt needs to diet anyways... Guess God put these employees here to give me proper motivation to stop eating fried food. 

Seriously though, This particular location just needs to fire it's whole staff and rehire some people that might actually like working."}
{"text":"Been coming here a lot. Never had any problems. And if I have a big order I always call ahead. Today I had a pretty big order so I went ahead and called ahead. Spoke with Danilo (I think He's the Manager). Very nice Man. Took My order over the phone. I wasn't prepared with all the order but Danilo was very patient and offered quite-a-few suggestions. Overall this is the first time I'm leaving this Popeyes Branch a Feedback. And this place definitely deserves 5 Stars. Thank You Danilo!!!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible. The place is dirty and takes FOREVER to get anything. I might as well go to Shop N Save across the street to make chicken at home. It's that slow. This must be a franchise because I couldn't imagine corporate running a store this badly. 

Go to the North Versailles location instead.The staff are friendly and the food comes out fast and is always hot."}
{"text":"Luv that chicken! The service can be spotty , I always order to go in store no drive thru. I'm 1 for 4 on receiving my fruit pies. Do not order them they have to fry them fresh every time & never make it into your bag unless you remember to remind your server. Hey at least someone at the store gets to eat my pies. Ordering an extra side dish & not checking bag to see if its in there? You fool you!!! This is an adventure every time, keep your wits about you, don't get distracted by customers or employees. Stay attentive & you'll be rewarded with what you ordered.  Now if I could just remember my friggin' pies."}
{"text":"I was very insulted. At this place. I walked in and ordered a chicken  strip  combo with mashed potatoes. 
What I got was 3 strips, french fries, and no biscuit.     Something else entirely.
  I got home and had to call them. 
Can you believe that  the person on the other side of the phone Said \" what the fuck do you want?\" I felt like crying.
And it gets better. I'm not a complainer. But  i thought that they should know how  messed  up my order was. I'm embarraged to say the next personon the phone  said. And  I quote \"where closed slut\"  Wow if your a women just don't go to this popeyes they not only were rude and mean  they were disgusting human beings literally the worst place I've been ?,
 I'm was and still am so upset. 
People like that shouldn't be  able to work in the service industry. Completely disgusted."}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't be the one to complain but I feel that this one is an exception. I Ordered 2 Tuesday specials. All 4 pieces were undercooked & the wait time as always, SLOW SLOW, & SLOW! And to top it all off, waited another 15 minutes for my replacement order. Time to fire everybody!!!!"}
{"text":"So I know what you are thinking Popeyes 
Freaking Popeyes really Popeyes ... Yes Popeyes
Did he lose his mind ?!? No. Is he back on that stuff? Maybe

Ok ok you're going to have to trust your boy
On this one 

Get the spicy chicken it's their signature dish
If u can't eat spicy DON'T go to Popeyes 

The sides are the clincher 
Cajun fries
Red beans and rice 
Biscuits
That's all I can vouch for 
But I bet the other sides are great as well

This is the most IMPORTANT part
I've eaten at other Popeyes in
Vegas and Hendo and all of them
EXCEPT this one stink 

I repeat this is the only Popeyes 
Only Popeyes I recommend"}
{"text":"The place was very clean and the cashier super friendly. She greeted me with a nice big friendly smile and took my order right away. My food arrived very quick and it was super fresh. 5 stars w/o a doubt."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I like Popeye's food in general and that I've never had a problem with any other location. 

This is my local Popeyes. I've visited this place several times over the last few years. They have only given me the correct order twice ever. I'm not even sure why they ask me if I want spicy or mild, what side I want, or what dipping sauce I would like because I'm lucky if they even give me the correct protein. 

Tonight I was handed the wrong order three times in a row, then I was handed the right order without any sides, and then without any sauce. Finally, when I got the order sorted out (which took three different people for a simple combo order), I asked for a receipt. Surprise! They told me they couldn't give me one and just waved me along.

Absolutely awful service."}
{"text":"This Popeyes needs some help.  Best part of the experience was the nice drunk man out in front asking to wash your windshield. 30 mins I waited for a meal that I was told I was waiting on Biscuits. The guy who came in 25 mins after me ordered the same thing and was served before me.  I sat quietly because they were bombarded with complaints. Including a lady who waited 20 mins for 4 apple pies. Left and came back wanting her money back after not getting what she asked for.  I'm also assuming she won't be ordering the turkey she was asking about preordering for thanksgiving. Or the guy who was laughing because it took 18 mins to get a biscuit and Cajun rice. 
Seems like management issues more than employees. Needs some organization and a level of service to live up to.  Hope they organize this place. A lot of upset people."}
{"text":"Chose Popeyes over the Wendy's next door because you don't see one as often. Big mistake. Drive thru took about fifteen minutes. Drinks were out but was told they'd take $1 off the price of the combo. They didn't. Wasn't given a receipt either so even if I had another fifteen minutes to kill I can't go back anyways. Didn't offer any sauce. Drove away before I realized. 
Sucky experience."}
{"text":"I have not had fast food for some time and wanted something quick in the area. Popeyes was my choice and even though in the past this location is known for bad service and long wait times, today's stop was not the case. I was met with a friendly hello in the drive thru which was already a change and then greeted at the drive thru window by the new General Manager April who has by far the best approachable personality I have ever been greeted with by any person working in fast food. She was happy, smiling, professional, appreciative of my business and apologized for previous business experiences. This location has finally changed and going in the right direction. Thank you for bringing in a new team who actually cares about it's customers and the business and thank you for bringing along April. She is the reason why i will be back. OH! And my order was correct for once and the wait was less than a minute."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. Both times you have to ask for basic items such as condiments and utensils for your side items that require it. Good was lukewarm."}
{"text":"I stopped by for the Tuesday special and was disappointed by the service. 

It looked like the manager was on cash and he was pretty busy yelling at the staff. He also overcharged us by around 70 cents. We got our chicken pretty fast but we were annoyed that we were overcharged and not given a receipt. 

Also, the spicy chicken was too salty and wasn't spicy but it was satisfying crunchy. Oh, and they don't sell cornbread (my favourite)."}
{"text":"No service at this location. Tried to roll thru the drive thru, after a few minutes of silence at the menu board I rolled to thw window. Three employees standing around doing nothing. Two looked at me and turned around so I left. Avoid this location."}
{"text":"Love the food! However, every time I come to this Popeye's the service is horrible! Last time I came they told me I couldn't order a poeboy sandwich because their \"bread was frozen\". This time I waited over five minutes for the drive through to even speak to me. Then from there when I finally got to the window I was given my meal. Then the woman realized she forgot my drink. Then she opened the window again and told me she forgot my apple pie but it would be 7 more minutes. I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Food is great, the tuesday promo is a deal. Forget the service tho. Came to the drive thru right before closing on a Tuesday night and it felt like I was being hurried along. I placed two seperate orders and they were all dumped in the same bag and I mean dumped. then the only excuse this drive thru boy could give me was \"I didn't bag em\" then promptly closed the window forgetting to give me the rest of my orders. I had to park and walk in to get them. your service sucks and I hope u guys read this!!!!"}
{"text":"10/23/14 10:00 PM

My wife and I were up in Las Vegas doing some shopping today, about 6:00 PM  heading towards the I-215 to head home, I remembered there was a Popeye's Fried Chicken ahead, we had never eaten at a Popeye's so I pulled in for a light dinner.

We went in to eat and were greeted by a very nice and helpful young man (named Maliq) we had never been in a Popeye's before and he and a young lady (named Chelsea) were so nice, helpful and patient with us oldsters, anyway we ordered and shortly Chelsea called us up to get our order.  At this point I asked Chelsea to write down her name and Maliq's name so I could include their names in a post on YELP and at that point they had earned their company a 5 star rating and they still deserve it.  The food was extremely good and also would have earned a 5 star rating on YELP.

Now for the 1 STAR RATING that I'm giving the store...

As we left the store, I held the door for a couple entering so my wife got a couple steps ahead of me and as I turned around, I saw my wife falling off the curb and onto the concrete drive-thru lane.  The problem was the outside building lights were off even though it was about 6:30 PM and dark outside.  The only light on the sidewalk and drive-thru lane was from the inside lights which was minimal at best and we were virtually walking in our own shadows.  The walkway and drive-thru lane are both the same tone of grey concrete and in the minimal light both blended into what looked like a ramp instead of a 6\" curb, the curb wasn't painted, a total disregard for customer safety outside the building, especially with the drive-thru lane right up against the building on three sides of the building, very poor design.
 
Lights turned on at dusk, a $6.00 can of yellow paint and a $0.99 paint brush a concerned and \"on the ball\" manager could eliminate any problems like this.

I went in and asked to speak with the manager, young women came to the counter, I explained to her that none of the outside lights were on and told her about my wife falling off the curb......

Her reply was,\"OK, I'LL GO TURN ON THE LIGHTS\" 
  
WHAT.....  not one \"smidgen\" of concern for a customer, my wife's condition!!!!!

I said thanks for the concern for my wife, I guess Popeye's doesn't   #1, train there \"MANAGERS\" or   #2 the company has no concern for the health or safety of their customers.

Anyone with a lick of sense would #1 be concerned about a person that was hurt.  If anyone got hurt on my property, my #1 concern would be the persons condition and what I could do to help, and #2 eliminating what caused the accident, but I guess these days, for the most part, people are only concerned about \"self\", you see it in grocery stores, freeway, just about anywhere, people have no concern for their fellow citizens anymore, this is another example of someone with no concerns for anyone except themselves.

I was so disgusted; I vowed to never go into a Popeye's again!

==========================================================

11/6/14
Well, it's been about 2 weeks and no response from corporate at all, only response was a call from the manager who offered my wife \"a free meal\", ya like I'm going to drive 70 miles one-way for \"a free meal\" and said he would check back.  This company, local or corporate, doesn't  gives a damned about the pain that my wife is going through due to their lack of concern for their customers well being.  I can only wonder if this attitude extends into their kitchens and food quality and preparation, I'm sure their concern for health and safety stops at the front door.

11/12/14
What a looser outfit, the manager from the store said he would call back and see how my wife was doing, what a friggen lie, never heard a word back from the manager, no response from anyone in their coporate offices.  No concern for their customers at all.  I'll bet the lights still aren't turned on at dusk and I'll bet they have made no attempt to mark their curbs."}
{"text":"I'm a pescetarian so I ordered the fish sandwich as I've done many times before and I was so hungry I just bit into it and I looked at it as I pulled away and noticed it definitely was not fish... They had given me a chicken sandwich... So check your order before you just shove it in your mouth, blinded by hunger, like I did."}
{"text":"I work two jobs and eat dinner out on day I work nights. I ate at this Popeyes 2 nights and the red beans and rice is just awful. All rice with a smear of beans stuck to the bottom of cup. Also they advertise the strawberry pie and now the cheese cake cherry. Never have them when I ask for it. Kid at cash register said he doesn't know what to tell me when I commented on the pies. I will not return again.
 I will not recommend Popeyes at all.
This is not the first time I had issues with this Popeyes."}
{"text":"For a fast food chain I have to say the staff was wonderful and hey it's fried chicken!....y ou can't go too far wrong LOL. I will simply add that my doctor may disagree with me LOL."}
{"text":"this is the worse restaurant ever. it took the cashier kaitlin 4 minutes to take my order, she just stood there , in a daze.  
the manager on duty, was just standing in the back by the friers talking to the cook in the back.  
the drive thru worker was having issues with orders, giving orders from dine in customers to drive thru customers.  
i was there for 15 minutes waiting for my 16 peice chicken meal. there was customers waiting that ordered before me.
this place needs help, needs a manger that will do something besides stand around and talk to other employees and on her cell phone.  
everyone there was running around like a chicken with its head cut off, not doing anything."}
{"text":"Great value. Sure, they don't run the twoonie special like the other white and red logo'ed guy but why should they? The chicken pieces are bigger, they don't smell half the time like tacos and they really focus on doing one thing: Chicken!

This time, I got the 8 piece bonafide chicken only $14.99 and the 10 pieces spicy wings for $7.99. I absolutely appreciate the fact I had to wait 10 minutes for the wings. When I got home, the wings were still pippin hot, my son truly enjoyed it and my wife gave it the thumbs up. 

Haven't been to red and white for two year! Thanks Popeyes....but...  Where is the spinach?"}
{"text":"So I figured they've been open for awhile, let me try again. Order a 5 piece tender meal.  Customer service was horrible, forgot to give me my soda, thankfully I didn't pull away.  Got home to find out I spent $8 on cold fries and chicken nuggets."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst Popeye's in town. Their employees are very rude , I have been to this location multiple times and and every time experience bad service , cold food ,flat soda and ect... Today I order the popcorn shrimp it look like they gave me the end of the basket mainly had nothing but crust from the shrimp in my box . I tried calling about 10 times no answer .I wouldn't recommend this Popeye's to any one and management will be seeing me tomorrow.."}
{"text":"Popeyes beats the pants off kfc.  We prefer their spicy chicken and have never been disappointed.  We usually have to go to the Priest/Eliott location.  Popeyes is like Whataburger in that once you've had either or both Popeyes and Whataburger, you'll throw rocks at kfc and the likes of McDonalds.  

Hey, Popeyes, why not open a location in South Chandler east of the freeway???"}
{"text":"While Popeyes is a fast food chain, not all Popeyes are created equal. I find the chicken and fries here to be fresh and not just sitting there all day, it really makes a big difference! 
Not much else to say but this is probably one of the better fast food fried chicken places in Toronto!"}
{"text":"The fried chicken and cajun poutine are both too salty and oily, made us want to drink more, but the soft drinks have a taste of bleach. Besides of all the disappointment, the price are quite high. 
There are seats outside the store, but there is construction next to the store, so keep stay inside the store or takeaway is better."}
{"text":"Okay, this is the third incident I've had here- No matter how many times we go here, something always gets missed. The first time we ignored it because it was too far to bother with going back. The second time they completely forgot a large side that was the main reason we went there. The third time, we checked before leaving and discovered they had forgotten one of our sides. Upon arriving home, we realized that they didn't give us any dip or sauce. Seriously? Never coming back to this location. I'd rather drive an extra ten minutes and know that I wouldn't have to drive back just to retrieve something that should have been in my bag to begin with."}
{"text":"Restaruant was kind of a mess. Additionally they were out of honey, ranch, cup lids, and straws. I ordered five pieces of boneless spicy chicken strips and was given pieces of chicken the size nuggets. I would not recommend eating here in the future. Lastly I was not provided with a cup for my order and to go back to the counter to get it, no attention to detail."}
{"text":"Only giving two stars because the food is decent. But wow, WORST service I have ever experienced at a drive-thru!!! While ordering, I heard two different people talking over each other like they didn't know what was going on. Then when I got to the window they made me repeat my order all over again. I asked if they could split the bill between two separate cards and they said no and were extremely rude about it. The two employees then proceeded to argue in front of me at the window with one of them saying, \"Who keeps letting all these people split their checks?\". So clearly they are capable of doing it and are refusing to do so. Ps- Raising Cane's chicken is a million times better and down the street."}
{"text":"My review is of this location. NOT Popye's in general, which IMO is normally one of the better chicken places.

I ordered the 3 piece strips combo. The chicken was ready, but they had to make fries. They were made and put in the heating tray, but the girls were busy talking, so I had to wait for them to finish, before my order was complete. I guess they cant work and talk at the same time.

The fries were hot, but the chicken not so much., After my meal I ask for a refill on my drink, to which I was told re-fills were .80. Seriously? Were charging for a pop re-fill? Everyone knows how cheap fpuntian pop is, and they are going to charge ffor a refill? A&W started that, so I added them to my list of places I won't eat at. I don't want to have to do that to popeye's. So much better then that Southern chicken place."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good chicken (got the spicy), very crisp. I was concerned about the lack of biscuit condiments, only to find it was plenty buttery. Very good airport option."}
{"text":"Worst Popeyes in town with rude yhat just don't care. I ordered their tailgating deal for the game which was around 94 dollars. Gave them a 100 bill and they said \"we're not allowed to take large bills\" and instruct me to go next door and break it. Unheard of a business that would turn away money even if it's their policy not to accept 100 bills. I hope the owner reads this and realize what that his employees are ruining the business. I will never go their ever again. Plenty of Popeyes in town."}
{"text":"I'm pretty certain you will die of a massive coronary failure after eating this chicken, but take solace in knowing that before you get cast off to the fires of hell, you will have basked for fifteen minutes in pure crispy, juicy heaven. For a sinner like me, this is my only way to see the true face of God. Now if you excuse me, the washroom awaits."}
{"text":"Am I the type of person to log on especially to taste Popeye's Chicken at 1am, yes I am. Pretty sure they put crack in the chicken cause it's addictive. Their fries are also fantastic. Only problem is portion size of the fries is small. Come on man, what are your overheads on some potatoes? I need my fix!"}
{"text":"Should of read the reviews before I went there.  First of all the drive thru speaker doesn't work.  There is so much feedback that I had to yell to be heard.  Like many other reviews I had to wait for the chicken to be cooked.  I asked for honey - got none.  Asked for mild chicken - got spicy.  Was asked to pull forward in the drive thru lane to wait for my food.  I asked where they wanted me to park,  she said to just pull ahead.  I pulled forward leaving a lot of room for other cars to go around us.  The thing that I am most upset about is the snotty drive thru girl that delivered our food.  After delivering our food she lectured us on where we should of parked.  First of all I parked where the other girl told us to park.  The two cars that came after us has PLENTY of room to leave.  Maybe you should worry more about getting orders correct than you should worry about where customers park.  Also if you EVER had food READY to serve maybe customers wouldn't have to park ALL OF THE TIME!!!  Never going back here AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"I could be a board member of the franchise. The chicken is as we say back home \" on point'! It is always a treat to get my fix at this Popeye's as it is conveniently on the way during my treks back and forth from Flag to Phoenix. 

I go through the drive thru. The people here are just doing their job, taking money and passing orders out. They don't move fast and I typically have to wait for chicken to drop and this means I pay and drive to the front of the store and wait for my food to be brought the me. This rarely happens anywhere else so I am gonna have to dock em."}
{"text":"Always slow, horribly mismanaged, servers have an attitude as if they are doing you a favor by taking your money. Avoid"}
{"text":"if i went into detail of my experience it would be a nice long story. So with that being said, save your time, money and your stomach!!! cant believe we cheated on canes! ughh.. a few of the orders were wrong, the biscuits were ok and fries were ok, everything els ... also drive thru guy forgot to give us our drinks and im already half way home when i realized... yikes wont be back!! The drive through guy was nice but forgetful with his job duties."}
{"text":"I always get really slow service and mean cashiers. I ordered 6 nuggets on Saturday which is the special of the day and the guy charged me full price because I didn't ask for the special. When I asked what the difference was he said I get a biscuit and the special doesn't include one. Just opened the package and got 6 nuggets...nothing else. Thanks Popeye's!"}
{"text":"Food is really not made or prepared right known for there fried chicken but KFC is way better and better pricing."}
{"text":"Chicken is good but if you want food fast go thru drive-thru and then come in and eat.  I went in restaurant and ordered. I watched the manager and a couple people working the drive-thru, leaving the cashier in front to take orders and eventually start filling the orders.  At one point there were 8 orders waiting to be filled. Waited over 15 minutes for my food and only got it after I made a comment to cashier. Manager never walked up front to see how many tickets were there.   Line was 4 deep when I left, and no one in drive thru.  Also no Apple Pie or Mud Pie.  :-("}
{"text":"The changes are so obvious. Customer service is better. Product is getting better. Had the boneless wings tonight. They were super good. It's just as easy to praise as it is to criticize. My granny used to say that. Good job."}
{"text":"I had my first--and last--experience with this Popeyes a few weeks ago. TBH I don't understand all the hype. The chicken breading was very greasy and the chicken itself was too dry to eat. On top of that, I had gone through the drive through so didn't look in my bag until I got into the hospital. There were no butter or honey for my dry little biscuit, no utensils, and no napkins. Although I was able to obtain napkins and utensils, it was an inconvenience to have to bother someone else for them. Their food definitely isn't worth my money."}
{"text":"Do not attempt, don't eat there
Picked up some takeout today and there was some tasteless chicken and fries plus coke slaw was bland
Also there a hair in the chicken crust!

Would not visit or try again."}
{"text":"Ok, Blame me.  I ordered Seafood at a chicken restaurant.  But, the woman in the ads says it's the best.  Hooey.  I ordered the 1/4 pound shrimp and fish combo for $8.99. A small handful of tiny lukewarm popcorn shrimp and a small fish fillet - less than 2oz, I'd guess.  Nothing like the bountiful plate of shrimp and two fish fillets in the display ad.  I asked for extra tartar and the girl said I would have to go back in line (behind 8 people) and pay $.25.  Forget it.  If you want fast food shrimp or fish, for the same price you can get a quality product at Culvers.

Crappy food aside, the place was a mess. I understand at 12:30 they probably had a lunch rush but the floors were covered with food scraps and trash and many tables had not been wiped down.  The Manager was walking around oblivious to the tables and floor and was concerned with washing fingerprints off the windows.  Really makes me wonder how dirty the kitchen is.

While leaving, I attempted to assist a woman with a disability enter by opening the door.  One half of the double doors was locked making it nearly impossible for someone in a wheel chair to enter or exit the building.  I think this violates a City Fire code.

This place is a Drive By  - not Drive Thru."}
{"text":"Best Popeyes location I've been to, I went later in the evening and they were quick and friendly. They messed up by charging me for a 3 piece instead of the 5 and they threw in 3 extra without charging the difference."}
{"text":"Part of the American Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen chain, this location doesn't seem to be on the Popeyes site, nor does it even show up on Google Maps but hot damn it's there, and it's good.

Tried it finally at the behest of a good American friend of mine--if Americans know anything, it's tasty fast food. Let's face it--you're not going to go here if you're looking for gourmet offerings or healthy choices. This is sheer deep fried indulgence, pure and simple.

The chicken pieces come in crunchy, tasty batter that puts KFC to shame; their honey biscuits are a signature item and live up to the hype--very tasty; I also tried their red bean and rice salad side and it was amazing, like deep fried beans, very good.

Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This location constantly makes errors with my order - I always end up with fewer pieces of chicken than I paid for. I would recommend always checking the order before leaving the counter."}
{"text":"I usually like Popeyes but not this one. The drive thru was slow and the chicken was so dry. I ordered the 4 piece combo and they gave me 4 breast pieces! Next time I'll go to another Popeyes location and avoid this one at all cost."}
{"text":"Very tasty food with extremely bad service! Didn't tell me I have to wait for my apple pie to be sent to the table. So when I got my order, I found there's no apple pie, so I asked and they said they would give it to me soon. After I finished my everything, they still didn't come. I got it finally when I came to them again and said where's my apple pie, they just slowly picked it outta the machine and gave it to me, without saying sorry or whatsoever. Plus, they were giving me attitudes like all time while I was being polite. I'm asian and I got a bunch of very good black friends. This is my first time to be treated racially by several black ppl."}
{"text":"0 stars 
- Customer service is non existent 
- Employees are morons and have no attention to detail 
- Management is no better and I wouldn't be surprised if this location closes within a year or two"}
{"text":"My order is not that difficult.... 3 of the same thing. One is spicy the others are mild. Then I got the excuse of the person taking the order. Black Friday and I am tired. More like get the wax out ya ears!!!"}
{"text":"Lucky to get one star because I parked by the door .
I ordered 2 #4 I ask for one to be spicy one mild they said no more mild .
Okay then 2 spicy and 2 pies done deal .
Paid and waited .
I ask for my cups for my drinks they gave me 2 I started to fill both then they said they gave me the wrong size and gave me 2 larger ones .
 Then they said my meal was done but I had to wait a other 13min for my pies .
I told her the rest of my meal getting cold now she said with a smile no it's near lights . 
I ask her what's happening today your out of chicken no pies this place is falling apart she replied we close in a hour it's like this every day . 
Wow that's the second Popeyes in Mississauga that operates very bad .
Food was not good rice was cold chicken over cooked  see picture .
 At this point I hope they all close in Mississauga again I'll  just go to the other fried chicken  guys so many in Mississauga ."}
{"text":"I will never go to this location again. 
I  would rather walk to Britana. 
Bad service. 
Management need to be trained so the can  train staff"}
{"text":"The best fried chicken at a great price. Sorry hipster . Popeyes is a great chicken at a fair price . This is new location in Mississauga . Welcome back, great staff food is super hot a fresh ."}
{"text":"I couldn't get popcorn chicken because \"the vendor ran out.\"
THE VENDOR.
Maybe I should just stick to the supermarket where I get my fried chicken. OR CHURCH'S. At least I know it's fresh and fried on site!
So I got some chicken tenders and fries. 
Measly meal for the price. Popeye's used to be a good deal!
I guess Scottsdale forced you to tack on a few extra bucks."}
{"text":"The worker was too busy laughing and not doing her job when we were ordering at the drive through so she messed our order up. When we told her we ordered larges she rolled her eyes turned around and yelled at the kitchen to fix it even though it was her mistake to begin with. Still was missing a drink and when we told her she asked \"WHAT!?\" Like we were lying to get free stuff. She over filled a bag with our food in it and when she handed it to us through the windows things fell out to the ground. She yelled \"God damn it\" right in my face. We asked for dipping sauce but did the rude worker give us any? Of course not! Most unprofessional worker I have ever dealt with. This place is a joke. Great food but not good enough to deal with the workers shitty attitudes. Don't bother coming here unless you want a heavy set Curley haired woman yelling god damn it in your face."}
{"text":"Popeyes is usually one of my favorite restaurants to go to. Tonight, I had volleyball practice and decided to drive myself to Popeyes afterwards. I checked to make sure I would have enough time before it closes, and since volleyball ends at 9, I assumed I would get there before 10. So imagine my surprise when I pull into the parking lot at 9:32, and see the chairs up on the tables. I thought something must be wrong, so I knocked on the door. The sign even said open until 10 pm! The two young workers did not even look at me. I was crushed. All I wanted was a Popeyes original 12 piece tender family meal with Mac and cheese and green beans. And I had the money to pay for it! So I got my sad self into the car and drove down the street to McDonald's, where they WERE open and happy to give me, a paying customer, what I politely asked for. I hope justice can be brought to this disgusting situation. Thank you."}
{"text":"The service here is horrible and always a long wait. The workers are always talking and being obnoxious. They're perception to a customer  is always received as an unfriendly one and they seem put out if they have to re do something. They talk more than they help, and I swear they're always getting orders wrong. I love Popeyes but this location is such a dread to order from but I go to because it's close to me. I wouldn't recommend this location, as the customer service is poor."}
{"text":"I've not eaten here in almost 10 years, but there's a reason for that - I'm now vegetarian.

However, when I did eat there I can say it was the best southern fried chicken that I've had (north of the border). Southern fried chicken is not the same a KFC - please don't try to compare.

Popeye's has lightly battered skin and the spicy option is the best (actually I have never had the non-spicy option). I'm not sure why but it's easy on the grease and you don't need wet naps to clean up - plus they don't have any.

The other pluses about Popeye's are the spicy fries and the biscuits.

If I started eating animal products again, this would be the place I go to first! All this coming from a person with a strict vegetarian (vegan) diet! 8^0"}
{"text":"Came here on my lunch break. Very friendly staff. I ordered the new spicy wing. Wings however were not that spicy and the fries were a little cool. Restaurant was very clean and was well maintained. Will come back again in the near future."}
{"text":"worst popeyes in all of las vegas, the manager and cashier was rude disrespectful and racist.. i was treated like a second class bum!!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst location, especially if you are ordering a delivery. The promised delivery time is 4:20, guess what, it's already 4:55, and still no sigh. I called in, they said \"why don't you cancel it?\".  So, I guess the driver has not even left the restaurant. WOW. Be aware! Worst deliver! Worst customer service! Can't say more."}
{"text":"Clean place. I went around 6pm and it wasn't busy at all, just a couple seated so there was no line at all. 1 register and the lady was nice and personable. Free refills for in dining. The wait time was minimal. They have $1.49 2pc thigh n leg on Tuesday.
*update! I asked for all thighs, I just now opened the box and it's combined with \"all\" I asked for what their special was and i wanted thighs only, she said there was an 11pc chicken only deal, so that's what I ordered.  I don't know if that deal was for all mix, but if I indicated thighs specifically then I should've been told otherwise."}
{"text":"Bummer that the review is solely based on the service. Totally understand that it is hard to find staff, but wow. Placed the order in the drive thru and the reply was \"4 minute wait\". Um, well, ok. I can wait. Then tons of garbled words came out and I had to ask them to repeat them selves 5 times until I got a \"pull to the window\". Wow. Total bummer.and after all that....my order was wrong."}
{"text":"Popeyes chicken 
This is the closest location to my house . All Mississauga locations closed.
Chicken is great fries are all right. 
My last visit they told me 15 mon wait fir chicken. I waited 35min 
Also note don't buy onion rings very soggy.
If this keeps up even the Toronto location will close ."}
{"text":"I ordered mild chicken did I receive mild chicken no I did not,I also asked for no gravy on my potatoes which were loaded with it.l will think twice. before  going to this one again"}
{"text":"The food was okay. Onion rings are good, but were served near room temp in this location. Shame.  They are tasty when hot. 

The experience. Ugh. Where's a no star when you need it?  First off, the floor was extremely greasy. Very dangerous. Yes, I realize they are a fried food establishment. Doesn't matter. Someone could seriously injure themselves in there. Either they aren't changing their mop bucket water often enough, they aren't using a strong enough degreaser or they flat out aren't mopping. 

The staff were all completely indifferent.  They only thing that seemed to excite them was cutting up with each other. Food was very slow. Request for ketchup was met with a scowl.  The salt and toothpick containers were empty and full of crumbs and long pieces of hair. From my seat I could see a worker  cleaning out her fingernails while standing over food.   Needless to say, I didn't finish much of my food after that. 

It's a real shame this location is so poorly managed. Popeyes, when done well, is a good dining experience with a tasty and original (for fast food) menu."}
{"text":"Xennia was outright rude to us in the drive through. She gave me the wrong order after making me wait 15 minutes in a parking spot. When I asked a question she literally shoved the bag in my window and walked away, not even acknowledging me, and stomped away. I would never come back to this location while this girl still works there. I'm not even looking for polite. Just not rude and obnoxious would be great. Ultimate fail Popeyes. Guess this is why ChickFilA or the Popeyes 5 min away gets my business."}
{"text":"What you expect. Open after midnight because it's 12:30 am and I am here. Staff are really nice. Food is from a big Trumpland chain."}
{"text":"This Popeyes is awful. I ordered 3 simple little meals to go. I waited a good amount of time and never heard my number be called. One tray sat on the counter for about 10 minutes until they put it on a shelf behind them. But it wasn't to go so I figured it wasn't mine and he had a called a number which wasn't mine. Then as I was waiting the manager was standing there wiping already clean trays not asking if I'd been helped. After about 20 more minutes a man asked why I hadn't been helped because I didn't want to seem impatient. So I told them my order number and they grabbed the tray behind them. I said I had asked for it to go. Then he handed me my bag with only 2 boxes so I asked why the third wasn't in there and the manager said , \" You must not have paid for it but we will give it to you at no extra charge .\" So I pulled out my receipt and showed him and they made it. When I got home only 1 of the 3 meals was actually right. Terrible service and an awful team. But as for the food it was fabulous."}
{"text":"This Popeyes is great! As soon as you walk in, the smell of delicious fried chicken will hit you. We ordered the 8 piece family meal with a large side. The server was friendly. They told us that our order will take 15 minutes, so he didn't charge us the extra cost of switching to all white meat. Ten minutes in, the server offers us two pieces of free chicken. The chicken was tender and juicy. The fries were crispy and flavourful. Would highly recommend this location !"}
{"text":"This is the worst experience I've ever had EVER! They successfully screwed up nine different orders at the same time we ordered and ate then we watched four different people come in from the drive through with there orders wrong. Our food was cold and absolutely tasteless. Folks don't waste your time nor your money coming here. There are to many alternative options in this area."}
{"text":"Typical fast food joint.  Nothing special about the flavor of the food.   Just a place to get fried chicken fast.  If you're in a hurry, and want mediocre chicken, come here."}
{"text":"So I went to get food for my employer the person threw the food out the window at me not asking if I needed sauce I spent 2 minutes trying to wave someone down to get it only to arrive and him tell me they forgot the order and when I tried to call they never answered. I work a block away and will never come back terrible customer service. I hope they get better I used to really like coming here"}
{"text":"Bought a 12 piece box of chicken to go last Friday night. When i got home discovered they put 6 legs and 5 thighs in the box. Not only did they short me on the chicken but they did not include even one piece of white meat in the order no breast or wing. Will never eat from this franchise again."}
{"text":"First night in Las Vegas. Decided to go with a familiar favorite from back home but not all locations are the same quality. This location seems to be struggling.  Chicken is just ok compared to the quality of Popeye's back home. Pass on the corn which was inedible"}
{"text":"What a place called Popeye's and no Spinach???

Ok just kidding. Well this place is fairly new to Macedonia, so I gave it a shot, I have been to others before

I ordered the Louisiana Chicken fingers with the Mashed Potatoes and gravy
It was OK....Chicken was cold and a strange wet taste to it not crispy at all.
I did like the Mashed Potatoes with that Cajun gravy though.

The service was very slow and it seemed non organized.
Doesn't mean I will not try it again sometime.
Was a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. They never have the monthly specials, they can never get the order correct. They never get the sauces correct. I went through the drive thru and when I departed from the window I discovered they didn't give me straws, napkins or my sauces. 

I have dined at this place 6 times since they opened and each time I had an issue with food. 

The good thing is the people who work there (@$10 per hour) seem to be nice. I guess the lack of quality is a direct reflection on the shift managers and their bosses. Unless you are starving, I suggest you go to another fast food place."}
{"text":"My new favorite location.. After being ripped off at vaughan mills location!

Oh bonus here, they give you extra tenders if they think what they're giving you is too small/unreasonable, unlike jane location which gave you tenders the size of nuggets sometimes it made more sense to get the nuggets."}
{"text":"Used to be good. Now i frequent the one by 400 n major mac.

I always order 5 pc tenders and always get 2 sauces(free), this visit i was given one and told to buy the second for 30 cents...

If the company had contact info on their site i'd call to confirm if its 1 or 2, and if its 2 i'd call them thieves... For now, just scumbags"}
{"text":"Both locations near me are bad. This one constantly gets our orders wrong. My boyfriend's chicken has been burnt while some pieces seemed like they weren't cooked enough. We always ask for spicy tenders yet half the time we are given regular or a mix of regular and spicy... when calling to complain they say to drive back to get it fixed... I'm like after I drive 15 mins there and back the first time I'm not about to drive back there a second time... 
Also the workers at this location are not friendly. They seem very short when you order and last time I went through the drive thru the lady in the window on the headset kept shaking her head and being very snippy. She did not seem happy to be working there. Almost all the workers I've been in contact with at this location do not have good attitudes. 
Also there have been times we have had to pull over and wait a long time for my boyfriends shrimp to be cooked and last time I went there they were out of all the tenders. How can a chicken fast food place be out of every tender? I've heard this has happened other times at this location as well. This location needs to be managed better."}
{"text":"I've been to numerous Popeye's locations before and was excited when I noticed this one was coming to my neighborhood. I went tonight for the first time and the drive thru moved quickly. I could tell the workers were trying to move fast. They got my order correct and the food was the same as I've had at other locations.

If you're looking for a quick chicken fix Popeye's is a good choice!"}
{"text":"Guilty pleasure every now and again, I always get the chicken tenders. Low rating does not reflect the quality of the food, but the quality of the service. The people that work here get more orders wrong than right. Can't count the times I've placed a clear and concise order, had the cashier verify it, but get something completely different."}
{"text":"Great staff and great food. There should be free refills for customers.  And also the tv is never on. But everything else is all good."}
{"text":"The workers make this place real crappy. They made me wait for a 4 piece of chicken. Half and half. We waited for about 25-30 mins. A lot of people tried to blame the manager. But it's these ghetto unprofessional black girls that make this Popeyes terrible."}
{"text":"I saw the commercial and thought i would give the $5 box a try. I went at 530pm tonight and took it to go. It was busy because obviously the $5 box is the attraction. I got the breast and drum spicy and my sides were beans and rice and mashed potato (out of cole slaw :( )...biscuit included. I will be honest in saying the drumstick was far more juicy than the breast but was crispy and zesty. The biscuit was fluffy. The beans and rice were well seasoned with a hint of smoky salted pork. You also have the option of having 3 tenders instead of 2 piece. They were very busy both drive thru and walk in. No one was rude but they were VERY busy. After my experience at the glendale location i was hesitant but i do not regret spending $5 on a meal after a full shift at work. The place was clean: floors tables windows and counters. Napkin station and tea station were stocked.

If people had a negative experience before those staff must be gone. There is a sign in the window that says now hiring for ALL locations."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst fast food meal I've ever had.  Fish and popcorn shrimp had a tasteless cardboard coating.  They were out of coleslaw.  The Jambalaya was seasoned rice with some chicken - nothing like any other jambalaya I've ever had.  The biscuit was pasty.  Never again.

{"text":"In terms of greasy fried chicken, Popeye's is the best.   Waaaaaaay better than KFC or Mary Brown's.  Their chicken is spicy, biscuits are delicious, and beans and rice can be addictive.   Just wish they had all the options available that they do in the States, they get more seafood and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is not clean. I'm actually scared to even eat the food. When I asked for a few condiments, the worker looked annoyed. I feel they don't want to work there and inturn don't care about their product or service. I'd go try out the restaurants next to popeyes here."}
{"text":"It's my guilty pleasure; I love me some Popeyes chicken.

To start off, THIS LOCATION DOES NOT HAVE THE TUESDAY SPECIAL! 
For shame. 

I got around to visiting this location and I can't find anything really positive to say other than the food is on par with what you'd find at most any other Popeyes location. 

Everything else was pretty bad. The gentleman who took my order seemed wholly disinterested and lethargic, the service was pretty damn slow, and worst of all, they completely botched my order--they gave me mild instead of Spicy, only 3 pieces of the 5 that I had ordered, and none of the sauces that I had asked for. 

Absolutely ridiculous, I'd avoid this location if you're looking for your Popeyes fix. Needless to say I won't be going back to this particular location."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in champaign! *information on Yelp is wrong that it shows \"closed\" now but I'm actually having food here."}
{"text":"Went here again tonight and while the service person was great, we didn't get utensils for our cole slaw or potatoes.  We've been here several times, but I won't go back again. How are we supposed to eat with no forks? Chicken strips dry and no butter for biscuits.  Cole slaw was room temperature.  If I could give this place zero stars I would."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Waited 20 min for food (on a 30 min dinner break) then come to find out my dinner was sitting there behind the counter...then there was no salt...then my tenders were mild not spicy. Tell your employees...if someone is in scrubs it means their time is very limited...wake up and stay on top of your orders. I ended up with not enough time to eat my chicken. I CHOSE to come here. I won't make that mistake again!!"}
{"text":"The place is terrible it was grose everytime i went in there they were rude all the time chicken was dry manager never dresses presentable always messy an the frys tasted freezer burnt"}
{"text":"got a 3 peice and a 2 piece dinner on sat. 4-2-16. the sales person was not friendly. the fries,roll and cole slaw was good. the chicken was terrible. dried out and old. the wing was unedible. threw it out. the manager isnt doing his job. if i lived close i would have returned it. wont be back."}
{"text":"Yesterday I went through the drive thru and ordered the 3 piece chicken tenders (mild) with mac and cheese. Once I opened the box and took a bite, I noticed the tenders were actually spicy, so I went back inside and told Kevin. Kevin, however, replied with, \"They're really not.\" To say that to a customer who can clearly see the spices added was really unbelievable to me. I persisted and Kevin finally gave me the mild tenders I ordered. He also said \"You can keep the other ones\" but really? Why would I want food that I didn't order? If I wanted spicy tenders I would've got those instead of mild. In addition to that, when I checked the bag, there was no spoon/fork to eat my mac and cheese with. I seriously could not be more disappointed with the service. Although the food was good, to argue with a customer like that is quite outrageous."}
{"text":"Ordered 12 hot wings at 10:40pm. Twenty minutes before they are SUPPOSED TOO CLOSE!!!! They were already cleaning everything and had attitude when I said I would wait for the wings to be cooked. I parked and waited and watched as they turned away multiple cars of people who wanted chicken so they could CLOSE EARLY.  Lazy worthless employees giving Popeyes a bad name. Then a Hispanic male who looked like a manager walks outside hands my wife our chicken wings saying have a good night. When I get home I'M SHOCKED to find overcooked wings WITHOUT BREADING FLOUR!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Complete crap to pull that kind of stunt! They were upset they couldn't chase me away so they messed up the order being LAZY. Too lazy to do Thier jobs till closing like a GOOD POPEYES. They wouldn't answer the phone also that night. I called after opening the box. The next day a nice female manager remade the order and it was perfect WITH BREADING FLOUR lazy night shift early closers!!!!!!!!!

RAISING CANES KNOWS HOW TO TREAT A CUSTOMER!!!! You lost a customer who seriously eats out almost every day. 

Get your night shift crew together!!!!! Want to close early? ???? Then don't work the closing shift jerks"}
{"text":"I paid for 3 chicken tenders + sides. $13.00!
I GOT ONE tender & three little crunchy bits that didn't have enough meat in all of them for a bite! So NO QC! 
Two apple pie boxes had writing on the inside flaps of BOTH--ew! So I tried to call the location, let the phone ring & ring & ring & ring--no answer, not even a machine. There was no receipt in bag or offered, so I can't even show that I was actually there. This was first visit to new location--and last."}
{"text":"Got the 2 piece Tuesday special and a biscuit for $2.50. Popeye's has the best hot & spicy chicken. The red beans and rice and biscuits are out of this world. Definitely recommend this place for the best fried chicken!!"}
{"text":"I have given this location 3 tries to get it right.. and all have failed miserably.  I once had a cashier that spent the entire order and serving of food with a phone to his face, another visit that the location smelled like sewage, and my last visit had fired chicken that tasted like fish.  I'm sure the last two issues had to do with a lack of cleanliness and the deepnfat frier in particular.

They aren't learning and I give up."}
{"text":"While food was considered very good in terms of quality, for a second time on a row I got my takeout order wrong again, paid to white meat bonafide and got the mix one. Don't know what to do to have my order the way l like"}
{"text":"If I could rate 0 stars, I would.  The \"rush\" was three orders.  My order wasn't even dropped, though there were 6 people behind the counter.  The lobby was a mess... Sticky shit on the floor, crumbs and other meal remnants on tables, and all the trash cans were overflowing.  The manager who took our order didn't even work at an acceptable pace.  Not even a faked smile or enthusiasm.  With having worked as a food service manager for 15 years, this place needs to hire an entirely new crew and start over.  I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone.

To add, once home, our order was incorrect."}
{"text":"Extremely fast, nice service and quality is amazing. Not greasy, not stingy with portions and very friendly!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken and huge portions. Twice the size of kfc chicken"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Had to wait 15 I minutes for tenders and place was empty. 
Place looked very dirty and the tenders were extremely small."}
{"text":"First time visit to popeyes and they would get a 3/4 on the food. The biscuits are great, chicken tenders ok. The service however leaves a lot to be desired. The young girl at the window barely said 2 words to me. She took my card, handed me a pen and the receipt to sign, gave me back the card and 2 receipts, 1 of which blew away because she didn't hand them to me with any care. Then, when the food was ready, handed me the bag and never said anything! Closed the window and walked away! I didn't know if that was my complete order or if there was more. I drove away and checked the bag just in case I had to go back. But not even a thanks, come again, nothing! Rude if you ask me!"}
{"text":"Want to eat new menu Ghost wing but it was out of it.

So I ordered three pieces of chicken strip combo. Chickens were tooooo dry and no meat to eat. It was cold too. I orderd it around dinner time so food should be fresh and hot. 

Cole slaw was disgusting to eat as well. 

But the person in drive thr was very kindly tho."}
{"text":"If anyone could believe it , I have never been to a Popeye's. I thought it was time that I checked one out. I wanted to know what I was missing.
I am sorry to say , I was not impressed. I really wanted to like it as well. I hear good things about it from other people. 
So this is a fairly new location. I came at a good time of day. Between Lunch and Dinner so they were not too busy. However, the service is a bit on the bad side. The worst thing is I was waited on by the manager.
The place looks clean ,so that is nice. I washed my hands while I was waiting for our to go order and the restroom is clean. However,I did not love it!
I got our order to go. I had to go to work that night, so I just wanted to get home before rush hour. My order was quickly prepared and ready to go.Plus the place being clean is why 3 stars. I got an order of chicken ,the dinner and a fish dinner.
I did not feel as if the chicken was cooked all the way, it sort of creeped me out. So we microwaved it a little more when we got home, after looking at it.
The fish was good,but everything was soooo greasy. I mean over the top. I got a side of mashed potatoes and gravy, they were good. I also got a side of Cole Slaw. Good but, a bit too sweet. I know they like things sweet in the south but ,no.
There is a place called Bojangles in North Carolina that is fantastic.Not greasy and the Cole slaw is great and not sweet. So maybe I am comparing. But sorry to say ,we just did not like it at all."}
{"text":"LOVE Popeyes.

Pros:
Best fried chicken there is.
The sides are AMAZING. 
Takes me back to my roots.

Cons:
Prices are a lot steeper than they used to be.

I've eaten so much Popeye's that I think a few years have already been trimmed off my life.........pretty good way to die I suppose."}
{"text":"I'm really just speechless at this point. 4th time going to this location. Every single time our order has been incorrect. Today marks another one. Ordered the new shrimp and cheddar biscuit and got home and it was not there. Ordered two spicy tenders and that was wrong and missing a mash potatoe. No straws or sauce as requested was in bag. Ordered a small extra potatoe and got a large and got charged for a large. Really have tried to give this location chances but this is it for us. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty poor customer service - we were excited to try the spicy wings after the commercial on TV, not regulars at all and won't be back. we went through the drive thru around 8pm 1/13..the girl working obviously couldn't care less and had no interest in helping us. we don't normally eat here and are not familiar with the sides, options or combos...after the way we were spoken to we will never try it again. We ask for more info at the window and was told \"I only work here\" ....what??? and because we are not familiar with this chain we were not offered any sauce for our strips and did not receive any. pretty sad"}
{"text":"I forget how much I regret coming to this one. Which sucks! I live literally 4 blocks away. And I love Popeyes! But the wait here is usually 10+ minutes . People it's just chicken biscuits and sides; come on ! all the other Popeyes get it right.  Why does it have to be the one I live next to can't?"}
{"text":"1 star for the drive thru; don't think they've gotten my order correct even once! I kept going back because the food is decent;  best mashed and gravy ever, and it was newly opened. I'm done. The employees don't know the difference between a breast and a thigh. I've gone inside twice and all was perfect. Calling the number on the receipt gets you to a corporate recording, so there's no opportunity to file a verbal complaint unless you go back to the place. I have even checked my drive thru order before leaving the window, found it to be wrong, advised them, and drove away thinking they wouldn't possibly be so careless TWICE, only to get home and find it was even worse than the first order they screwed up.  Inside dining/customer service-5 stars; drive thru- wish I could give a zero."}
{"text":"Was disappointed to get home and find out my 3 piece strips was only 1 strip. My daughters kids meal had chicken nuggets that were so old and hard they weren't edible. I love Popeyes, but I think I'll drive further to the other locations and skip this one. Kid at the window had to ask me twice what I ordered when I got to the window and didn't even give me any utensils or napkins. Luckily I was going home so I had them, but I've never had such a lousy experience at a Popeyes."}
{"text":"I think you should use real pictures of your food in your ads because that shrimp or chicken is not even close to those pictures. That's fake advertising. Also why would you not have a hook on the back of the doors in the restrooms? Do you really think women want to put there purses on the floor or hold them in there laps to use your rest rooms? Come on now hooks are very cheap to purchase, I think it's the sanitary thing to do for your customers."}
{"text":"I don't think I'll go back! The chicken was hard and very dripping oil, wife and kids did not like it, had to give left over to my dog, I would go to KFC next time."}
{"text":"I'm surprised how many good reviews there are for this location. Whenever I've gone after about 8pm, the chicken is cold and stale, and the selection is extremely limited. This isn't 10 minutes before closing, mind you. I've been there with 2 hours to go before closing on a weekend night and it's always the same."}
{"text":"Really bad service! I've used their drive thru service and have had bad experience on 2 occasions (have used them 3 times). 

First time, paid and the cashier said \"thank you, by\" so I started to drive, then I hear her yelling out for me. She forgot my drinks! So, I just stopped, thinking she will bring them out.....no cars behind me..... NOPE! Never came out, so I had to park and get out to get my drinks from inside. Meanwhile, they were all just chit chatting inside. No apology. 

Second time, just today..... I ordered, paid.... cashier tells me it will be \"3 minutes\" for my fries and to go park and wait. So I do. Waited longer than 3 minutes, it was actually 7 minutes. I go inside, and the order was just there off to the side. No one cared to bring it out. Defeats the purpose of using drive thru!!!
My food was cold, biscuits were old and we ordered a 12 piece family meal. Apparently they thought giving me 6 wings and 3 legs as part of the 12 piece was a good deal. 

I have ate inside before, like the other comments say.....it is dirty! Employees don't care and take no pride in their job. Sad. No customer service skills. Definitely, no desire to make things right!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Popeyes. This one is terrible. It's practically in walking distance and we have to travel to one of the other popeyes. Quit over cooking everything!"}
{"text":"Love Popeyes and I frequented this location as soon as they opened. From the very initial visits there's been an issue with getting the correct pie. I would order apple then get home and it would be sweet potato or something else. Silly me to keep going and ordering pie without checking box. I would always go back and they'd exchange out the correct pie. I hadn't been to this location in about a year. I went back today since I was out shopping. Ordered meals and a single apple pie(they're my fave). I get ALL THE WAY HOME and notice there's NO PIE in bag!!  I was so annoyed but I really wanted it so drove another 15 minutes back to get it. They have got to do better."}
{"text":"I've gone to this location a few times. Each time I've gone I've ordered spicy and received mild. I'm not sure why it's difficult to give someone the food they ordered. Especially when you read their order back to them. Both times it has been a monthly special. Meaning they should be cooking a certain amount to keep up with demand and speed. I also ordered double fries the last time I went, and my wife ordered fries with red beans and rice... they gave us both red beans and rice... I think I'm going to avoid this location from now on"}
{"text":"Service is terrible never have any chicken ready super rude and food was nasty! Never again will i come to this location"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times. The time before last I had to wait nearly 20 mins for the wrong order. I didn't notice until I was back at work with less than 10mins to spare in my lunch break. I called to let them know my order was wrong and the lady was not only rude, but mocked me. Said I could come back and they would replace my order with was a 3pc tender with a side. So I went in today for that replacement order and was only given half the order, yet again an incorrect order. So I called back in and yet again, the person on the phone had a bad attitude and mocked. They obviously don't appreciate their customers and don't care for quality control.

I can't see why I would go back. Maybe if I want to be disappointed and insulted."}
{"text":"I come to this Popeyes often. It's a running joke in my family as to what items they will either be out of or flat out tell you they refuse to make it unless you would like to wait 20 min. It's always a complete surprise what kind of chicken you will end up with no matter what kind you actually ordered. Today on a Sunday afternoon they were out of sweet tea. The girl at the register said we didn't bother with it today.  actually made me laugh. Oh and also. No biscuits. But  I did get some chicken. Wonder how long the manager is going to run a business this way and if employees want a higher min wage. What kind of fast food service would I get for my higher priced chicken with no biscuit and not to be bothered with sweet tea?"}
{"text":"Me and my man have tried this location numerous times and every time it has disappointed. Unfortunately with it being the only Popeyes in this part of town, there isn't another one we can just hop over to to eat. Terrible service. I get it, everyone has a rough day.. but when you're shoving our food into bags cause you can clearly see that you are upset with your other team members, or just don't speak at all and are no help when it comes to ordering there is a problem. Half the time they are ALWAYS OUT OF SPICY CHICKEN.. and one time we visited, when we asked if there was any more coming out, the girl at the window was actually very nice and said it would be about 12 minutes if we wanted to pull around and wait but as she said that, some other employee yelled at her very rudely from across the kitchen saying they aren't making any more and that was that. Good customer service? Far from it. And they can never get your order right.. even if their lives depended on it.. 4 time out of 5.. you will end up with something you didn't order, or have to go back because they forgot something, or they apparently don't know the difference between spicy and regular chicken. I'm so over it..."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars.  I walked up to the counter and the cashier tells me she isn't working yet.  Then the manager comes out and tells her she is the only cashier.  Then I waited like a fool for several minutes while the cashier fumbled around with her drawer before I walked out without ordering.

If you're even thinking of eating here, snack yourself in the face and go someplace with decent food and service."}
{"text":"They forgot to put 4 biscuits that come with the family meal.

You know sometimes you wanna have some fast food.
Well, today was that day and I ordered chicken 8 pieces family meal + corn on the cob (L) +  mashed potatoes (L) + cajun gravy (L) through Ubereats. 

At first, I was kinda hesitant to order through the app. for few reasons:
1. Most fried chickens in town especially those Western ones like KFC are greasy and just flat out terrible.
2. Ubereats delivery person might spill gravy since the person was riding a bicycle.

When I received, everything was perfect. They packaged well and the delivery person did an awesome job of not spilling anything. 

The chicken pieces were very nice. They weren't greasy and those spicy pieces were alright. I'm one of those people that seek for spicy food and my body can handle Thai chili like it's nothing so I guess I wasn't impressed with spiciness. At least, I could taste a bit of spice tho. 

For large, you get 3 corn on the cob. I wonder how much corn you'd get for small.  Anyways, those 3 corn on the cob brought on nostalgia because I used to have them a lot as a kid. It was good. Speaking of mashed potatoes, well.. how could you mess it up right?

I honestly think Popeyes' cajun gravy is one of if not the best gravy of any fast food franchise. They put various ingredients like veggie pieces and meat pieces into their gravy that it would be extremely addicting for those gravy lovers. 

Although they forgot to put 4 biscuits, it wasn't that big of a deal since I'm not a huge fan but remember, they could forget to put your biscuits! Next time, I might be just ordering chickens-only + large side instead of family meal and not get the biscuits at all. It's like a dollar cheaper.

To me, this place is like a high end version of KFC and whenever I crave for Western fried chicken, this is the pick for me at.

The chicken pieces weren't hot when arrived but as far as the fast food joint is concerned, this place gets a solid three."}
{"text":"This place seems pretty grungy at first glance and it hasn't changed much since it was first opened it seems but the food seems quality at this particular location. The chicken seems well done or at least that your not gonna get sick from it and the biscuits are fantastic as usual... I would say the only qualm I have is the cleanliness of the place which doesn't seem great. both inside and out there is always trash all over the parking lot and the tables never seem cleaned inside. all in all, they are ok and i will return for the fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Unless you're lucky enough to be flying out of somewhere like Changi Airport in Singapore, the expectations for airport food is set pretty low

Fortunately, the fiancée (then mere girlfriend) and I like fried chicken (part of our bond is a mutual weakness for KFC). A little research threw up Popeyes as an option for lunch when we flew out of McCarran

It's definitely a fast food operation but that meant the line moved quickly. I love that in the USA, customers get a choice of white or dark meat. So, we ended up with chicken, biscuits, fries and corn on the cob

I enjoyed the chicken - moist with a crispy seasoned coating. Sides were ok. It was a good meal for airport food though I think Lolos fried chicken at Phoenix airport still wins my best airport fried chicken award

Incidentally, Popeyes is in terminal C but terminals A, B, C and D all join up airside so you can still eat there if you're flying from any of those gates"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I have to give this place a negative review. I'm giving it one star because you can't give zero. I went in there yesterday evening to order a snack. I thought I'd try the popcorn shrimp to see how they were. I took one bite and almost gagged. They tasted like they had been cooked with a dirty wet dog. It's a day later so I guess I didn't catch anything but they were inedible. The rest went promptly into the trashcan. Don't these people try their own food? Never again."}
{"text":"Fast food fried chicken at it's finest!

Everyone has a bad day.
I had a bad day.
Feeling down, I returned some stupidly expensive shoes (my attempt at retail therapy) then I turned to Popeyes for some food therapy...and I wasn't disappointed!

I would have gone for a small family meal, but I didn't want four biscuits.

I ordered the 5 piece tenders (tender meals are bigger than nugget meals).
If you order your tenders spicy, they have to add hot sauce under the batter so your order takes longer to make, but they are worth the wait.

I took my food home and opened my $10.00 cardboard box of glorious calories, grease, and comfort.

The biscuit was buttery, super salty, warm and flaky.
The fries were piping hot and crispy covered with cajun spice.
The chicken tenders were lightly battered strips that hit the spot.

I don't really like the bbq sauce, a bit heavy and smokey for my taste, but I'll still eat it.

It's a fast food joint, it's not really 5 star food.
But I'll give it 5 stars because it's cheap and cheerful! :)"}
{"text":"When I eat fast food on the road I love me some Popeyes!  Always delicious.  This time did not disappoint.  Good and fresh but the ladies behind the counter chatted with each other more than they spoke with the cusotmers."}
{"text":"How do you have a 22 minute wait for chicken at 6pm??? This is the prime dinner hour. You are supposed to be prepared.  
Additionally,  why would you put a trainee on a register during the rush? I understand that he needs experience but not at the expense of the customers time!!!
Food is good but service is terrible at this location and no management in sight EVER! !!"}
{"text":"We were waiting over 30minutes in the drive thru tonight. These guys need to be better trained. If a huge order comes through the drive thru they should ask them to pull over. But what makes me really mad is my friend in the car behind us. She had ordered fish and shrimp. After waiting over 30 minutes, she gets to the window where they dare to say we didn't prepare any fish. And practically forced her to get chicken instead. What the hell kind of service is that?! They didn't seem sorry at all and forgot to give her sauce. I will never return to this location again. Also, while waiting for our food at the window we watched as one of the female workers just texted on her phone while doing nothing. Texting instead of making the fish. Someone fire these people and hire a better manager. I'm beyond disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered a 5 peice tender with ranch and a diet coke. They gave me a 3 piece(with no biscuit) coke zero and bbq sauce..."}
{"text":"The staff is amazing! I went last night when it was super busy. They were all very nice and made sure every customer was happy while you waited. Checking in on how long the chicken was going to be and letting you know after they checked. It was so nice to see the staff just fully engaged in getting the orders out as fast as possible. The most important thing was they communicated with each other. Great job to all of you and to the hiring staff for putting together a great team who functions great together. Side note; I'm so glade I bought the new cheesecake pie."}
{"text":"The worst sevice EVER! They messed up my order twice in a row and maintained a \"so what\" kind of attitude. They seems more interested in conversations amongst coworkers than paying attention to customers."}
{"text":"This is the worst Popeyes I have ever been to. The store was dirty and the staff was not helpful and has no sense of urgency. It is located in a not very safe neighborhood, there are many weird looking people. The manager has absolutely no customer service. Not a place to go!!!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTE WORST customer service!! Waited 10 minutes in a relatively empty store to order, after which the lady LAUGHED at my order. Took my money and did not give me a receipt, then left to the back of the kitchen again. Simply ordered a few 2pcs which were clearly ready in sight but still waited half an hour, after which ANOTHER man asked us about our order and informed us they did not receive the order. After a few more minutes working things out (complicated by the fact that we weren't given a receipt) the lady then came back and served my chicken with no words of apology or explanation of how she failed to key in our order. Rough handling of chicken also left it in pieces with all the skin hanging off in the box. 

Absolutely unacceptable service, not the first time either. Don't come here unless you have an hour to kill, might as well spend that time driving to a different location. The lady ahead of me in line was still waiting on her order when I left."}
{"text":"I needed chicken for a holiday party and I talked to Eddie, the manager, who was super nice and told me to call 20 minutes before I needed the chicken so it would hot and fresh.  I did, and when I got there, it was just about ready and everyone was so nice and awesome!  This is one of the BEST popeye's I've been too!  Kudos to Eddie!! Thanks again!!  :)"}
{"text":"The \"manager\" runs the drive thru window at lunch.  Here's how my experience went today.  

1) Unprofessional order taker, was rushed and patronized.
2) Lady dressed as manager said that'll be x dollars and took my card; didn't make eye contact.
3) She handed me my card and food, didn't make eye contact, said nothing else, closed window and walked away.

You can get away with poor service and still stay in business for awhile, but eventually 'word of mouth' will ensure you improve, or close your doors.  Good luck."}
{"text":"The Tuesday special chicken was great today as was the fish sandwich that you let me sample.

Now I have a dilemma the next time that I return in that I have to choose between the fish sandwich and the chicken meals..."}
{"text":"I used to think that when going to a fast food restaurant that the best and easiest way to get the meal that you want is to order according to the number on the menu, but I found out otherwise here today.  Be careful right now as their ordering system has been changed and it is not giving you the meal that you order and in my case caused me to be overcharged by a couple of dollars. I ordered a three piece spicy chicken tenders meal and they charged me for a 5 piece and even when I told them about it they at first tried to tell me that I was wrong until they finally actually took the time to listen the second time what I was saying.

In my perspective it's not so much that there was a mistake or a problem but when you immediately tell the customer that they are wrong when they pointed it out to you without looking into it this is not good customer service"}
{"text":"This is the worst service ever.  Placed my order.  Just a 3 piece strip.  They are crazy busy and not properly staffed.  Took thirty minutes.  No jambalaya but didn't tell me when I ordered.  Mashed potatoes are watery.  Chicken cold.  I still don't have my apple pie and I'm done with my food.  I listened to a man complaining to the manager it supervisor on duty.  She gave excuses and told him to call her regional that she would tell him the same thing.  Poor guest skills.  Apologize show empathy and and see what you can do to make him happy.  Most only want to be heard.  Someone needs to step in and help them before they implode"}
{"text":"These chicken pieces are puny! What a ripoff!!!! And the flies can't get off my food.... Stay away"}
{"text":"I do love the chicken! I get the mashed potatoes without the gravy, and put butter on them. Delicious!  Every time I have been there it has been really good, except the last time the piece I got was a little dry. The Raspberry Coke is great. Bring back the strawberry cream cheese pie!  It was the best!"}
{"text":"I had tried this place a time before and wasn't impressed but decided to have something different and this was on the way home.  Drive thru has the menu placed in a way that you cannot be near speaker to order and see the menu.  I placed my order, correcting the speaker several times, and repeated every response. Got to the window and she asked what I had ordered.  There was no one inside and there had been one person in front of me. Not so busy they had to sort through orders.  Had to repeat entire order, nothing was complicated or substituted. Total gives, paid.  Card returned, drink passed.  Minutes later a girl opens the window, asked if I had my drink, hand d me a bag, shut the window and leaned against the counter talking with coworkers. I had to signal to ask if this was my complete order or if I was waiting.  She nodded and closed the window and went with her conversation.  I think it's awful customer service when you feel like you have interrupted the server and are a bother.  With no customers in line or in the store maybe they should attempt to satisfy any customer they might have.  The food was decent, not worthy of the price for sure.  Won't be back to see if the third time is the charm. :("}
{"text":"What can I say? My son loves him some Popeye's Chicken. He's born & raised here & there aren't many of these in the valley anymore. But the closest one to us is this one & when he wants him some fired chicken this is his/our go to place."}
{"text":"Helen and Effie you ladies are the best!! Customer service at it best. Best po boy sandwich I had."}
{"text":"Popeyes dirty rice has been the reason I will go out of my way for then.  Their cat fish was always very good.  BUT!  In Phoenix, Az they no longer have dirty rice more the catfish.   I still like Popeyes, but now it runs neck to neck with other Chicken fast food chains."}
{"text":"Plain and simple 1 star. Went there on a Tuesday evening, about 5 pm and I wanted their new beer can chicken. Asked for that and they said they were out of it for the day. Frustrated as I was I asked for some spicy chicken wings. They had some special up I forget. Again out it. I said thanks anyways and drove away. Came back that week on a Friday at 2pm. Asked for the beer can chicken. Guess what. Out again. On a Friday at 2 pm. Isn't this place suppose to serve chicken?? Especially the one they have 3 posters up Of and are advertising on tv!! As soon as they said that I said thanks and drove away. Not going to go back to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Nice polite workers here. Very professional.  Every time we come in we are greeted with a smile. And the food of course.....YUM!!"}
{"text":"Order was not taken correctly.. I got mash potatoes instead of french fries.. They were out of biscuits and still charge me full price for the combo... Chicken was stale and dry.. Very disappointed.. I would recommend raising canes nearby if you're in the mood for chicken strips"}
{"text":"This Popeyes is the worst ever! This is my second shot and the chicken was stale asf, cole slaw has blackpieces of cabbage, the mashed potatoes had balls of whatever like it wasnt even made properly, the biscuit was dry and old!!! Never again,EVER! I would rather drive my ass to california to get Popeyes. DONT even bother, go somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"Visited this site SB during halftime - didn't check order which was a big mistake. But talk bout being ripped off. Purchased 8 piece chicken only which had old chicken in it u know it had dark brown spots, and very dry and a spicy heat surf turf dinner which suppose to contain shrimp, fish, chk strip what I received was two chk strips( supposed to b one) and one shrimp. Wasted $20 and Popeyes lost a customer."}
{"text":"This place is ok. It's close to my work and when I'm craving chicken I can satisfy my craving at Popeyes. Today I ordered the 3 piece combo with a medium strawberry soda. I would say the medium size soda  is like a large at other fast food places. I also got a large coleslaw. The drive thru is pretty fast so I would recommend not stoping inside. Overall I would come back for the food. 

On Tuesdays when they have there $1.99 deal for 2 pieces the place is super busy. But I've notice going around 8 pm you get fresh chicken and the lines are gone."}
{"text":"Horrible. Every time I go there, months apart at that, my order is ALWAYS messed up. I just went 20 mins ago & was so upset they didn't give me all of my food (I paid $33.60) I decided to not even bother going back in. The manager was so busy telling the ONLY kid actually working that he needed to do more work when she (the manager) was the one who messed up the order. Then of ALL the customers she only asked my husband for the receipt but didn't ask any of the others & just gave them the food. Spicy chicken is super bland. No cup lids. Drink fountain leaking. I never do bad reviews, but after 2 years, multiple turnovers, the place just needs to be shut down."}
{"text":"Disgusting waste of money don't EVER go here. Popeyes is usually good but this was just disappointing. Chicken tastes old and dry, biscuits are RANCID, and Mac & cheese tastes like bottom of the barrel boxed type ."}
{"text":"A nightmare! Hubs loves the biscuits so that is the one lone star.

Service is a joke. The staff acts as if they are bothered by your order or the fact you may take a moment to think. We are often rushed and greeted with a forced and lackluster greeting. Let's not forget management. The cursing and unprofessionalism is enough to make you want to come out of character.

The food is fried so what could be wrong with that right? If you happen to go on a okay day you may find they have all the items cooked and ready. If not there will be only wings and in spicy, only 2 sides and only 3 soda options. As I discuss spicy please don't expect your order to be correct. 

I think the last straw for us was a warning given by several associates that for a couple of days their chicken smelled like it went bad and the manager said \"fry it and sell it anyway\". How despicable is that?

On rare occasion you will get the nice associate and reasonable management or a correct order... But that is RARE! Just isnt worth the hassle or experience."}
{"text":"Its a lot better than KFC, and less oily. When after for a quick chicken fix. If you have a spicy chicken craving definitely come here. Ordered the 8 piece meal more than enough for 3-4 people unless your all guys than get a bigger meal.... Anyways fries were hot and fresh, mash potatoes with gravey was good, could have been a little more spicy though. As always the chicken was hot and juicey."}
{"text":"After reading some of these old reviews it is very noticeable that they have improved greatly. 10 out of 10 would recommend. They had great service and the chicken was so fresh. I also has fries and Mac and cheese which was also very well prepared. The store was very clean. I think that maybe they need to work a little bit faster however it was worth the wait. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great chicken as it was fresh. The service was great. The store was also pretty clean overall. Only didn't give enough ketchup but it's ok because the chicken was."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that this place you call a business is rated at 2 stars...

It was this last Monday night 10.3.16 at 7:30pm. I ordered through the drive through service. I ordered a meal which included the standard chicken-fries-biscuit. A normal order, so you would think. I pull up, I give payment, and I receive my order. I drive off, and 10 mins later I ask my wife for some fries, and fries are not in the bag... I head back to the restaurant. This is when everything goes to shit. I should have known this was bound to happen when you see another customer storming off the property kicking the door open. 

So I head into the restaurant and I tell the so called manager on duty that the fries were not in the bag that she handed me at the drive thru. She then replies with, it should be there, I HAD A CHECKLIST...  I replied with, are you serious? She replied with never mind... with attitude. I then go to my car, and get the bag that she handed me and she proceeds to look like in the bag... I then told her, do you think I would really drive 10 mins back to this place just so I can get an extra side of fries? This manager insists that she had a checklist... she keeps an annoyed and bothered look in her face and body language. Meanwhile there were two other associates with her working the register and the fryer... saying, this is bullshit, fuck this, fuck that... apparently this type of service has been happening all night. It seemed like they were tired of her mistakes from the night. 

At this point, I was pretty heated and I just wanted to get out of this place. What a disappointment. I've loved this brand for a while now. This one incident really put a bad impression and taste in my mouth. I'll make sure I go out of my way and go to another establishment going forward. 

STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION. really immature, untrained and unprofessional individuals working at this location. Give your patronage and your well earned money somewhere else."}
{"text":"I enjoy Popeyes often get it in large bulk for family and parties, but I won't at this one. First, the staff is friendly and the food came out alright, but very disappointing red beans and rice. But what got me is when I asked for extra gravey I want told a side of gravey cost. Keep in mind I've been to at least 10 Popeyes and never had to pay for a side of gravey (it's mostly water anyway) so I assumed it was free (shame on me)  now when I got to the window they didn't even have the gravey made so I asked for it and noticed my receipt $1.99! For a tiny, tiny, side of watery gravey (seriously thicken it up cheap o's) I wouldn't mind paying ¢25 even but $1.99 are you kidding me?! If I was told at the window that side of brown water would be that much I would of passed. The icing on the cake is I get back to work and no spoon, napkins, or dipping sauce. Busy or not there is no excuse to miss all that. If you go here check your food, check your receipt, and enjoy cheap watered down sides to make it last longer is very scrupulous! Most disappointing Popeyes I've been too and they will not be earning my large family and party orders. Hope a regional manager comes by and gets on this location."}
{"text":"Drive thru makes it not a fast food experience... them my order was wrong once i got to the window .. then when they got it right to my surprise there is no sweet heat so now i have to settle for something else... then to get home and notice i had been shorted a shrimp on one meal... n only given one spork for my two mash potatoes and once again had to ask for honey even tho i have biscuits"}
{"text":"I came here at an odd day to have some fried juicy chicken. The area is nice and plenty of seats, the staff was quick to order and served fresh off the fryer. 

The staff was good to let us know when our strips were ready. Its a good location to go and enjoy some Louisiana's Chicken!"}
{"text":"Food is as good as any Popeyes, but service was ridiculously slow. There wasn't a clean table in the whole place, floor was filthy, and waited 4 minutes just to get some BBQ sauce packets."}
{"text":"service was great, food good. management please pay attention to your website hours of operation. keep them up to date. nothing is more frustrating for the consumer than wrong hours posted  on website.      

     pre internet era management would be suing the local newspaper for printing wrong hours. post internet era management no longer cares about such mistakes.  

     however; the consumer remembers."}
{"text":"Food and service are always fantastic!! It's clean and everyone is friendly. I recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Louisiana fast!

I haven't had Popeye's in forever mostly due to all the locations in Denver being in undesirable parts of town but it was right in the middle of our terminal at the airport so why not?

Oh lord, I forgot how delicious their grub is! I got the chicken biscuit and their biscuit are flaky, fluffy and buttered to perfection, their chicken has just the right amount of crunch with a kick of spice that made it almost impossible to not scarf down in seconds. 

The employees weren't the most personable but oh well, I really wouldn't expect that much pizazz from a fast food place in the airport."}
{"text":"So far I'm pretty  impressed! I thought popeyes was just another crappy chicken place but honestly everything I've had here is delicious. Chicken is CRUNCHY moist and tender without being too greasy. Sides have tons of flavor and do no taste overly processed like KFC does. Since discovering this place  I' ll never go to a KFC again!"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times since I live down the street from it.  They have recently done a little remodel...nothing too fancy, just some new wall paper, table and chair replacements.  A nice update.  Soda machine was a lot cleaner this time as compared to last several times.  The older lady cashier was really nice, definitely could tell she enjoyed her fun little extra spending cash job.  :)  I got the promo dippin' chicken meal.  good deal, fair price, tasted good, fresh...tasty.  would recommend!"}
{"text":"The worker who took my order here via drive thru at this location came off as rude and unprofessional, i have placed a combo order and asked for a side dish, straight up the worker says \"you cant order another dish\" did not understand the reason behind that and i did not want to reason about it so i let it slide, then i have asked if i could change my drink ive ordered and the man whose taking orders says a straight up \"NO\". Management should retrain these workers through better communication. I have never received such horrible service , if tht man has had a rough day he shouldn't introject tht to anyone because he clearly was an asshole. This person worked the drive thru on rainbow popeyes southwest location on date 4/24/17 and he served me btween 1530-1600. Customers should never receive this type of treatment.  Will not come to this location anymore, i am planning to make a bigger complaint about this especially through its food preparation process, my drink i was given presented an opaque tan color when i ordered a sprite. Questionable and unprofessional!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way home from work since I was craving chicken and go the $5.00 box special with spicy chicken, double order of fries, and 2 biscuits.  Well the service was ok and pretty fast as I didn't have to wait long for my order and the food was hot.  Or course I ate the fries on the way home (I just can't help it) and at the chicken and a biscuit once I got home. 

Well the chicken very extremely puny and lacked any kind of spiciness whatsoever and tasted like their regular chicken.  I mean these pieces of chicken were really small and made me regret not going to my default chicken spot Church's Chicken. The fries were ok and didn't taste like it was cooked in old grease and fairly warm.  And the biscuits were pretty good also but I see that also getting smaller as time goes on. 

I probably will not be stopping here again and will listen to my first mind and go to Church's Chicken instead."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is slooooooow! 9 out of 10 time that I go to this stores drive thru I am told to pull up and wait 10-15 minutes. They are often out of something and there is a long wait."}
{"text":"Came here to order to go but the service is very bad, the cashier is very rude don't know I want to come back to this place anymore."}
{"text":"Yes there were some mistakes made, however the manager D'angelo, went above and beyond to correct those mistakes and ensure our meal was enjoyable and to our satisfaction.  I highly recommend this Popeyes because the customer service was excellent and that goes a long way with me.  We will definitely come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Always had good chicken and good service and the store was very clean. Normally eat at Popeyes once or twice a month and normally never had any problems with any location."}
{"text":"Stopped at this location on my way home from work. Ordered my food, which included a large coleslaw side.  Almost home, I realized I didnt get it. When I went back, the cashier had attitude,  didnt offer an apology or anything else for my trouble coming back. I was shocked at how small the large side is for the $3.89 price! !! Wow!! Always check your bags before leaving!! Won't stop here again! !"}
{"text":"Food is the same as other popeyes and the staff is friendly.  Had to wait 15 mins for my sons order which is mild wings.  Usually have to wait no matter which outlet we go to.

This outlet gets 2 stars cause it is so dirty. It looks like they do a steady business and dont need to clean the place.  The chair seats have a black grime and the walls and floors are in desperate need of a cleaning and renovation.  Parking was very hard to find in the cramped parking lot."}
{"text":"Final straw went threw drive thru ordered shrimp meal n pie came up to 7.55 get to the window pay with a ten he hands me my change says 2.45 only when i separate it there's only 1 buck  so i alert him to the situation at hand he fixes it no problem  now look in the bag no sauce for my shrimp #wtf  i ask can i get a sauce he's like u want another one  no i want the I'm owed  .... didn't ask if any condiments were needed period which i find an issue with fast food n good acceptional customer service . When he hands me my sauce i say thank u he just closed the drive thru window .

{"text":"This my friend is a new location and thank God Popeyes is back in ssauga. I wont have to go to Brampton and Oakville to have my favorite fried Louisiana Juicy chicken.
I like their weekly deal!

Lets get down to logistics:

The location: not far from Square one!

The Shop: is quite decent size and there is plenty of seat, good for groups. The place is kept clean. Didn't use the washroom so don't know how it was kept.

The staff: is friendly, nice and quick to execute. 

Parking: Plenty of parking as its in a plaza

Now the Food: Their chicken pieces are crispy and not crazy watery like KFC and not as salty as KFC. I love their burgers as the Bun is quite nice. I love the strips and usually get them on the side!
Ohhh wait for it..... THE FRIES ARE TO DIE FOR!

If you are into fried stuff you would love any location of Popeyes. The rating is based on the location or else its a 5 star for me on the food in the fried category!"}
{"text":"Portions were too small, they do daily $4 deals but only accept local debit cards, no credit.

Had the chicken bowl for $5.99 and it was tiny! I was expecting something like KFC sized bowl but this was ridiculous, never going back again! Even went to the next door Fine Asian Bowl to supplement our empty stomachs!"}
{"text":"The chicken is good, the customer service is great, BUT the long wait for food is crazy. My average wait when I go at lunch is 15 minutes, sometimes sooner. The average wait is 3-5 minutes if you go after the lunch rush. What can you do? Anyway, the food is good and everyone that works there has great customer service. They need more fry cook and help."}
{"text":"I stopped in today and the staff who was working were extremely pleasant and attentive. I places my order and a young lady let me know it would be a couple minutes for fries and then a guy rung me up. As I was sitting and waiting the guy brings my food to my table and Thanks me again for my business. Then the girl double checked with me to make sure I received everything okay. I wish I would have asked their names but thank you to your staff."}
{"text":"I have a Southern soft spot for Popeyes. I love everything about it for fried chicken, sides & a biscuit. My fave for sure. I was so excited when I saw it gong up. The service has been super quick inside. The drive thru lines have always been long so just skip it & get yourself inside. The AC is really chilly in the dining room & there is no outdoor seating so I always take it home. My only complaint is the managements food orders are consistently off.  Apparently the sauce orders aren't being made correctly. I have been a handful of times & each time they have been out of one kind of sauce asked for. Not the same sauce either. Blackened Ranch 2x, Creole Mustard & cocktail sauce 2x. Not joking. The bummer is when you order the shrimp, pay for the shrimp & nobody tells you that they are out of the cocktail sauce till you come back to ask for the sauce... One Thursday evening I ordered the chicken strip box deal & they said they were out of that chicken. I said oh ok. What are you subbing for that since you're out. They said we can't. We're just out. I said ok. No sorry, no sub, no nothing. So I just left. Too many options in the area to deal with that lack of service. I want to give 2 stars but my Popeyes soft spot won't let me."}
{"text":"I purchased a 5piece with two sides and two biscuits all of my chicken was burnt and I did not get 2 biscuits and i have tried to call and the number is busy.if you order drive thru make sure you check your food"}
{"text":"My goodness!  The first time I stopped in to dine I thought .... Man This is some greasy fried chicken!! Too greasy to enjoy. I haven't had Popeyes Chicken in years  but when a few of their coupons showed up in my mailbox I said why not?! They had some really good deals.

On my second visit with my coupons  I dined with my boyfriend and the kiddos. We ordered a mixed batch of about 11 pieces of chicken. The manager was kind enough to let us switch some of the chicken pieces out for chicken tenders. We ordered fries, cole slaw and red beans and rice. Loved the fries, next time I'll pass on the slaw and red beans and rice."}
{"text":"It's a big mistake to give one star to this store because there lazy like a turtle. I ordered 5pcs tenders drive thru and take note, I waited 45 minutes in line. Is there a way I can give negative 100 to this store? Helloooo wake up!!!!"}
{"text":"First and last time here.  I went through the drive through and ordered a fish Po'Boy with mashed potatoes and a sweet tea. They asked me to pull forward and they would bring it out to me.  Bottom line is they never brought it out.  After waiting 10 minutes and watching numerous cars get their orders I went inside to ask for my money back.  When I walked in they were putting together a 7 piece chicken for the current person in the drive through.  The noticed me and handed me the bag.  I asked them if I ordered something wrong because it took so long to get a simple fish sandwich/  They said no, they had not turned their over on?  They did offer me a pie for my trouble but I said no and left.

When I got back to the office the fish was cold!!  I didn't even get a hot sandwich. It was $8 which is totally a rip off.  I am never going back here.

Sweet Tea - way too sweet!
Fish sandwich - cold and fishy
Mashed potatoes - Pretty good."}
{"text":"Came in today to order (2) 3 piece meal took three times for her to hear me right he speaks too fast for me or she might just be in a rush stores a mess looks like it hasn't been slept in days"}
{"text":"Always liked Popeyes better than KFC, but seriously, this location is slow AF. The workers always seems to be very busy but nothing gets done. Come dinner rush, the line-up is usually out the door simply because of the slow service. While I was waiting for my order, I see a bunch of Ubereats drivers waiting for theirs too. Quite ridiculous. So if your order takes longer to arrive, it's not the driver's fault; put the blame where it really belongs. Food is good, but this lethargic service has really got to go."}
{"text":"Just walked out. Waiting in line 15 minutes . Only one employee in front. Then no cole slaw. Then no chicken. They ask us to wait 15 minutes.  They need management bad"}
{"text":"The new location is very colorful and fun. The parking lot was a little dirty with cups and trash, music is a little loud, but other then that the location is great. The food is hot and fresh, some pieces of chicken has a lot of coating and not so much chicken and the sides are a little small at least for bigger appetites. The Ice tea is good too."}
{"text":"We stopped in at this Popeyes on the strip to grab a quick bite to eat. Once we got back to our hotel which wasn't far the food was not very fresh. My husband and I got a personal order together and needless to say we still didn't finish it after sharing. The fries were so cold and disgusting. The chicken was just ok and the red beans and rice didn't have a good ratio of cold rice and beans. It was super thick. Not going back"}
{"text":"I've been going to this Popeye's for years now since I live about a 2 minute drive away from it. The food here is decent, usually pretty fresh as it is busy most of the time. You need to pay for refills here, which is weird but they have always charged people for it. I always order the tenders here as they usually always have to make it fresh and the tenders gotten a lot bigger over the years. You can always get fresh food if you know they hadn't prepared it beforehand. For example the Tenders and sandwiches are 90% going to be made fresh so give it a bit of time. Chicken will most likely be off the heat lamps so don't expect fresh chicken if on a non busy time. The chicken is usually pretty oilly too. Mash potatoes are decent not much to say, onion rings are the worst here, I tried them 10 times in the course of 2 years they always have been the same. Bland and soft, the worst for onion rings. The biscuits are pretty good here, you can tell they are fresh if their warm and slightly  crunchy. Fries here are not bad, they taste best fresh but you rarely get them real fresh unless you go in when there is nobody there or near before closing. Overall food is 3.5/5 best is tenders, sandwiches and biscuits. I also tried every thing on the menu.

The service is slow sometimes, usually around 10 minutes and longer when they have to make the food fresh for you. They also lie most times when they give you an estimate for the food, such as \"5-6 minutes for tenders\" I waited upwards of 10. When you know the staff there for some time they start to give you a little more than others, like a bit more fries or a extra tender which is a nice surprise. They are more welcoming to regulars and like it when you know what to order and order it fast, they will always ask for mild/spicy, side and drink so be prepared. They don't like it if you want to pay with credit/debit on an order smaller than $5, they say they cant accept it but I've done a couple times so they lie a bit for their own comfort.

Restaurant itself is pretty nice, they keep it clean and maintain it pretty well. It gets pretty packed on certain times so I tend to go when I know it isn't as bad so either right when they open 11-11:30, 2-4, 8-10. Food is also fresher on these times as they have to make it fresh because less people are there.

Overall its not bad but could be better so I rate it 3/5 as they can do a lot better, but as the closest fried chicken restaurant to me, I won't complain much."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is more about this particular location than Popeye's in general.  I actually like Popeye's chicken and fish, it is very good for fast food...everything in moderation.

The problem with this place is the lazy ass staff.  No one here is in a hurry to do anything.  To call this place fast food would be an oxymoron, emphasis on the moron part.

If you want to wait 30 minutes to get some chicken, by all means go to this location.  I have just given up on this place, they should provide cots to people waiting in line because it is that slow."}
{"text":"This location has the slowest performance in fast food history. I've been here 3 times and every single time I've had to wait and average of 20 minutes to get food. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the chicken was good. I'm just confused that none of it is ever ready when you order it. They always have me \"pull to the side\" and I have to wait for them to make it. I will find another location if I get this chicken again. Thank you.."}
{"text":"First time this year I went here and they messed up my order.  Went back again today and the order was messed up too.  Took about 20 minutes in the drive thru too.  The car 2 ahead of me got their order, then pulled to the exit, then pulled in front of me while I was ordering.  They had messed her order up too because I saw a small carton passed to her.  The chicken was good, but the wrong stuff.  The biscuit was blah, the coleslaw very oniony, and the cajun rice extremely dry and tasteless."}
{"text":"Great staff and the great taste of Popeye's!  So much more friendly and honest than the new S. Stephanie location. It's worth the extra ten minute drive to get great quality with actual customer service."}
{"text":"My go to are the biscuits and spicy chicken tenders. For the last two times I've been here, my order has been consistent, delicious, hot, and correct. I absolutely love the biscuits.... So crispy, buttery and so yummy."}
{"text":"Disappointed in my first visit. Young lady that took my order was very soft spoken and I could not hear or understand what she was asking me. Speak up! Had to ask for my drink cup after waiting over a minute. Three employees saw me standing there, not one of asked if they could help. After speaking up, the employee who handed me the cup seemed a bit put out. Food was mediocre, asked for a chicken thigh, got a small leg that was more pigeon than chicken."}
{"text":"One star is too generous! It's weird to look forward to writing a bad review, but here I am. I think this is ONE OF THE WORST POPEYE'S in Vegas/Henderson.

Every time my family orders the 2pc special, spicy with white meat they habitually get it wrong. The lazy, half sleep, lackadaisical zombie staff always give the exact opposite, 2pc dark meat, not spicy. If we order fries they're usually cold and God forbid you return your meal, they respond rudely and when I asked them how they got it wrong when I had 3 orders with white meat they say \"we just grabbed the chicken that was next to us\". WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?? They also took my order of apple pies, charged my card and then told me they ran out when I got to the window. Why charge me for something you know you don't have? The worst comes next. POPEYE'S should not hire anyone that doesn't know how to speak in a professional, courteous manner. I'm not asking for an articulate scholar in the drive-thru, but don't tell me \"we don't got any any apple pies you want the other one?\" Then I asked what's in it? He says, \"lemon n' shit\". WHAT?? WHO HIRED THIS PERSON?

The parking lot was designed to hold you hostage while people are in the drive-thru line. You're literally stuck until the traffic frees up to back out. So, triple check your order and make sure your chicken's hot. It seems like the person that opens the place in the morning cooks a pallet full of chicken for the entire day. COMPLETELY LAZY!!"}
{"text":"I will just say I have never had worse service, and a more rude staff then this location. I contacted the corporate office, and never got a response. I will never go to another Popeyes again.."}
{"text":"Receipt reads 1203pm....not that busy...ordered for two...had to wait until 1230 chicken...because they don't have any ready for lunch.....girl working in drivethru playing on her phone in the back....what looks to be the manager was hiding in the back...came out for a brief moment when customer was requesting a to go container, corrected her and said 'you mean you need a box'....shirt all untucked....used the public restroom had to use a key connected to a nasty piece of wood...,only two working seemed to be the cashier guy...but he never put on gloves when handing food and a lady working the line...mostly by herself"}
{"text":"You go thru drive thru and are asked to pull around and you have to wait add almost 20min to get your food. Isnt drive thru suppose to ne quicker. I could have just gone inside."}
{"text":"Finally, after the close of the last Popeyes in Heartland one opened up. I love their deep fried Louisiana Juicy chicken.

This location is quite small and does not have that many seating, so it would be more of a grab and go; considering this would be a very busy and the location is quite good.

The cashier service was great but the cooking staff was quite slow, most probably they are still training as they have opened new. Will have to try again to check it out.

The food was fried right and tasted as good as always!

On a separate note they have increased their daily special prices, so buyer beware!

See you eating some fried chicken!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for young unprofessional employees and bad customer service, please come to this Popeyes. I drove all the way to this one and received nothing but bad service. The wait was long even though I was the only one in line. Once I received my food, I drove all the way home to get home and find out that I was missing some items. I called and asked to speak to a manager and was told that she was busy. I told the lady on the phone that I would wait, and then was asked it it was urgent? I told the young lady that I was a customer and that I would wait to speak to the manger on duty. I was then thrown on the counter waiting for no one to ever come. I then drove all the way back to ask for my items and also to speak to the manager. I spoke to the manager and let he know what had happened and was just given excuses on how she is a young manager. That's not my problem!!!! I got the the point of being annoyed and just asked for my money back. The manager told me she would refund my money, but still not give me my items I paid for in the first place. I told her I think corporate needs to get involved due to more issues. Employees should not be calling each other racial names, especially in front of customers. All these issues need to be addressed. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Service horrible.  Order taker had a huge language barrier.  We were the only people in the restaurant.  Other customers were getting food before us when they arrived after us.  When our order arrived, no forks for mashed potatoes.  No drinks with food until we asked.  Chicken was really cold.  Will never return."}
{"text":"Well, it's Tuesday and you know where i'm at. Yep, you guessed it, Popeye's. 2 piece Tuesday special, 99c. I get the spicy, but the mild is just as good. I usually get whatever selling the fastest so that i know it's the freshest. (freshly fried that is). Crispy, well seasoned, juice meat, with that amazing crust. 99cents? Wow, this is as good as it gets! 

Also love to come here for the most amazing red beans and rice you can get in any restaurant. I used to work with a guy who was born and raised in New Orleans, and he told me that Popeye's has the best version of this dish in the country. One of my buddies here tried eating it and didn't like it because he was eating it separately. The trick with this dish is that you have to mix it all together before you eat it. That is how you will get the full effect of this amazing dish. Love them chicken from Popeye's... but also love the red beans and rice."}
{"text":"This location is so unorganized and a mess...I placed my order at 6:56 pm it is now 7:45 and I'm still waiting.   At 7:25 I asked the manager to check on my meal and she said they're waiting on mild chicken... granted I ordered a 16 pc family meal but I've  watched numerous small meals go out and asked if they're trying to get those orders out first, giving the mild chicken and now I'm waiting.... she shrugged. She said it will be another 10 mins for the mild chicken and asked if I wanted to wait... at this point I might as well just wait (it'll take me longer than that to go somewhere else and order. When my # was finally called, I had 2 large gravy(s) and no mash potatoes, 1/2 my biscuits were missing. I was not the only one waiting, I couldn't believe the amount of customers waiting and frustrated. I walked out at 6:49....so irritating & unacceptable. I won't return to this location"}
{"text":"Food was really good,  I've been to other Popeyes and was nOt impressed but this one just may change my mind...it will take more than one visit to determine that. I do wish there was a menu prior to the order menu in the drive thru, just because I'm not familiar with their menu and felt rushed once I was at the order menu. Also I given my box of food....no bag just my box of food which I thought was weird, would've liked a bag to carry my food from my car back to work (along with my purse, drink and other stuff).... and no straw for my drink (that's always annoying) but food wAs good so next time I'll walk in and check it out"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it 0 stars. The orders are ALWAYS incomplete! This is unacceptable, especially after the long wait"}
{"text":"Slow service and the last 2 times I've ordered takeout, the type of chicken in my order was wrong. I guess I have to open the boxes each time and make sure my order is correct in the future."}
{"text":"Great food and the service was great!  When you walk in here you are always treated like family. 

4/2018 update. Just got some fresh chicken on the Wicked good deal of chicken. Now the only problem is I have to smell this golden freshness the whole way home. (We bought it to eat tomorrow)"}
{"text":"I've only been here 3 times, I always order something I saw on one of their commercials but EVERYTIME they are out of the sauce that is supposed to come with it. WTF?! they were even out of the second choice I made. really??"}
{"text":"The chicken, biscuit and fries was fresh. Even though it is fast food, I wouldn't mind waiting for more than 15 minutes for my dine in order. The problem is that the customer service. They don't seem happy serving the customers, I don't know why. When I asked for ketchup for my 8 big pieces of spicy chicken, she only gave me 2 ketchup packets. I asked the lady if she can give me 6 more ketchup. She said 2 is more. I told her \"Okay. Please give me my money back because I don't want my order anymore if you are only going to give me 2 ketchup packets for my 8 big pieces of spicy chicken.\" She got upset and gave me 5 ketchup packets. 
Both of us weren't happy because we had a fight over ketchup packets.
Will I go back and order there again? Probably not."}
{"text":"Faheem the store manager at Popeyes is very friendly and courteous. Mostly, store is very busy time to time, good food and service but longer time to wait for your order."}
{"text":"Them 10 piece Cajun Wing combos are like nothing I've experienced before. Fingerlicking goodness all up in mouth. French fries needs work tho, every time it's been soggy or dry and tastes like it's been sitting for a long time."}
{"text":"I have never eaten at a Popeyes's before today, and I won't be going back. We decided to try it as it is a new location very close to our home. Staff was very welcoming, and that's the only positive I have about this place. For being a new store, it was filthy. We sat at a table near the window and my daughter pointed out several dead flies on the window sill. My husband had to take our son to the restroom, and he said that, too, was filthy. We waited about 10 minutes for our food, and again we were disappointed. The chicken pieces were tiny, and taking a bite, were cold. Like room temperature cold. It tasted like cold rubber. The biscuit was dry and bland. Very disappointed, will not be returning."}
{"text":"I have intermittently eaten at Popeye's for more than 20 years.  Early on, I wasn't a fan of their food; however, when I got into my 20s, I found that it was delicious and made it my go-to chicken of choice.

My husband and I recently moved to the Tempe area temporarily, just down the street from this location.  About two weeks after being here, I decided to stop to get one of their meals.  In one word:  yuck.  It was a chicken-strip meal with two sides and a drink.  The chicken was cold; the sides were cold; the biscuit was as hard as a rock; and the drink was flat.  There was nothing that redeemed the food.

I thought that they were having an off-day, so I decided to come back a few weeks later for the $5 box meal, which comes with three chicken strips and two sides and a biscuit.  Yet again, cold and flavorless.  And this time, it was delivered with extra helping of terrible customer service, at least according to my husband, who went to pick up the food.

Against all hope, I decided to give them a final try a few days ago.  And what do you know:  The food was abysmal again.  Read the above paragraphs to see the quality of the food.

In short, I won't be going back here.  Popeye's food is too expensive to be serving up drivel in a box.  Get your act together, or at least network with the other Popeye's in the valley to see what they are getting right, which is, apparently, everything compared with you."}
{"text":"Probably the worst customer service I've experienced. I went through the drive thru which had one car in front of me. I ordered a 3 piece chicken. I waited for 20 min to get my food. While I waited at the window not one person said anything to me. No \"sorry for the wait\" or anything. Never going back again"}
{"text":"I don't typically write reviews for fast food restaurants but I almost didn't go here because of the other reviews.  I was there on A Saturday afternoon around 6pm.  I went thru the drive thru.  I had to wait which I expected because it was supper time.  The cashier was friendly.  She verified my special request to ensure accuracy.  The food smelled so wonderful!  As I unpacked my order, I was impressed with the extras that were added to my bag.  There was jam, honey, hot sauce and utensils.  That doesn't seem like much but to me it was adding the finishing touches!  The chicken was so fresh and crispy!  The biscuits were divine as was the rest of my meal!!  It was comparable to the Popeye's food that I've gotten in Atlanta and Savannah!   Way to go Albemarle Rd Popeye's!"}
{"text":"It's wrong how you over work that poor staff in there. I hope you get your franchised looked into because those girls were about ready to cry. No job should have any type of sadness for as much as they were over worked!!"}
{"text":"It's always nice to find a Popeyes chicken wherever you are. For me, If I have to eat fast food let it be Popeyes."}
{"text":"Ordered a two piece chicken two weeks ago and got home missing a piece.  Was in the area for lunch today and talked to the manager telling her I want to order the same two piece but to please add the piece of chicken that wasn't in my last order per the receipt I showed her.  

Simple enough, replace a single piece of chicken that was left out.  I wasn't looking for anything else.  The manager proceeded to treat me very rudely telling me I didn't call it in when it happened, like that would make a difference.  I told her I didn't see a note on the receipt with directions for the customers to manage Popeyes screw ups. 

She continued to be very condescending and rude, in effect blaming me for her employees screw up. Then pushed some food towards me to run me off.  I insisted on paying for the meal I just wanted the missing piece of $1 chicken replaced.  She would have nothing of it, just waved me off.

Nope, I wont be back to that place again.  Why take a simple mistake and make it into a full blown issue.  Any other business would have been happy to correct the problem quickly and professionally.  

Take your chances eating there, if they screw up your order prepare to take the blame.  She is a very poor manager and probably a reflection of her management and how the company treats all customers."}
{"text":"here's an update... I went in again October 7, 2017 with a coupon from the webpage for this particular store and they refused to honor it. The manager said that they do not honor the coupons on their website. I have called the corporate offices to try to see why they won't honor their own coupons and no calls back. They just don't care about customer service I guess. I wouldn't bother going to popeyes as they put out coupons, but don't allow you to use them. So strange. Subway is right next door, Pizza hut, Roberto's and china wan wan are all in the same parking lot along with Omelet House and they at least have Louisiana catfish on the menu. But what good is it to go to popeyes  with a coupon for them to say they won't honor it and too bad for those that have printed it out. Just not good business."}
{"text":"The only place I will order any kind of chicken from. The fried and grilled are definitely meeting my standards! I haven't been in a while, but I'm hoping to return next weekend! The mashed potatoes aren't my thing, too much spice. But I'm extremely picky! Don't let my review deter you from trying them! Each their own! I love the Mac n cheese and the biscuits!! The chicken is always cooked to par and I'm never let down. The ability to buy tea in such large quantities is a big plus too! I know they have it at stores, blah blah but it's still warm and freshly made! The staff is always attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"All I can say...they need some help. Good sitting out to long drying the chicken out, no spicy chicke and a 25 minute wait..."}
{"text":"Ok... Is it really that hard to give mediocre service in an ok if done well fast food chain... If you're stumped, the answer is a resounding, yes it is... Got caught up in reading and before I realized it I've been sitting there for 29 minutes and still no food... Oh Hurray shift change... Let's get out if here and ignore my order that has been on their order screen... Had to leave becsusechave an appt... Couldn't eat couldn't take the good with me... General manager seemed quite responsive to the problem... Gave me a card to cone back... And refund my money... That was 03/02/2018... Today is 03/17/2018... 15 days later... Asked to speak to the manager to address that the money had not yet been refunded... His name was Barry and tried explaining to him what had happened and that my money had not been returned yet...  All I can say is... Atta boy Barry... Absoluetly no help... Said it can take 7 days to show in my account... Saud it's been 15... Nothing I can do... Come back and talk to the general manager... Didn't even ask me if I wanted to get anything... Once again... Atta boy Barry... I do have high standards, but I do know when and where to lower them... So low here I'll make another trip to get it settled and then this place is gone to me... What the he'll one more time... Atta boy Barry..."}
{"text":"I have to say, I love Popeyes above all other chicken joints, but this one needs help.

The place is well kept so there is no issue there.  However when I walked in, the young lady behind the counter was leaning on her elbows with face in hands...and stayed that way until after the first order.

Next, they had piles of chicken and it all looked great.  Then after sitting down I realized it must have been 15-20 minutes old.  Not warm, and starting to pull in.  Very disappointing.  Their are rules on how long it can sit.  

Of course they had to give the smallest portions humanly possible.  So heads up, 2 piece dark dinner and a 3 piece combo, almost $19.00.

The Spicy was red, no spice.  My 10 year old daughter could not tell the difference.

I will say red beans and rice and the biscuit still worth the effort.

And their new meal sucks."}
{"text":"Terrible experience here I don't know why I have to ask for some honey for this dry biscuit and repeatedly forgetting stuff I ordered. Plus they need to keep that new pie stocked."}
{"text":"If I could I would rate this place 0 stars. The customer service is bad and they don't care if they give you old food. They gave us portions that were less than half and were too lazy to make more. All the food were stale and dry, you can see the employees saving all the big chickens to take home. Don't come to this place not worth the time and money. Worst food I ever had!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to grab something to eat yesterday and got the 4 piece chicken meal got to say I was impressed the service was really good the food came out well except for the cajan fries some were hard some were fresh not sure if they just kept some of the old fries and mixed then with the fresh fries because when I ate some of the fries that's what it tasted like overall I would come back to this location as other then the fries I didn't have much problems with anything else I got to add that the chicken was delicious and it was fresh and that alone would make me want to come back."}
{"text":"Just picked up a 3 piece meal with mashed potatoes and biscuit.

Omg-- the chicken breast was totally, totally dry.  Inedible.  I have not had this experience before.  Husband wouldn't eat it and threw it out!  

Did I get an old piece of chicken???? Really upset that I paid for this."}
{"text":"I have never been to Popeyes before last night was unimpressed with the food and felt it was a bit pricey"}
{"text":"Here we were in Charlotte, on a bit of a fried chicken binge because the area seems to be littered with various locations that sell fried chicken. I had tried to go to one of the local places, but the one that I knew of on Wilkinson was closed (this was on a Sunday... I get it). So the fast-food variety would have to take its place.

Enter Popeye's, because the other big fried chicken store a bit down the street to the East was apparently closed as well. We go in and are greeted by the staff, who were in good cheer, happy to be there. This is always a nice thing to see in the harsh world of fast food, because it means that management is also taking care of their people.

We looked through the menu a couple of times and finally decided on getting an eight-piece box of chicken. The person at the counter immediately suggested that we instead order two of the four-piece specials that they had on the menu, since that would be cheaper (saved about $1.50) while giving us the same thing. In fact, we were able to order one half with original recipe and the other half with the spicy blend, which we did. So, both cheaper AND more variety!

We got our chicken and headed out, as we were planning on eating this chicken in our hotel room. We got into it there, and it was good chicken! It had a nice crispness to the coating, and the chicken itself was tasty. We weren't able to finish all of it that evening (we had had some appetizers earlier) but it kept just fine until the next day for lunch when we ate it next to a lake looking at swans swimming by. 

In a pinch we would go back here... the staff made it worth it! Normally for fast food chains I won't rate them any higher than three stars unless something exceptional happens... and this time it did with the treatment and attitude of the staff! Good job!"}
{"text":"Aight so normally I do not rate fast food cause everyone usually just rates when they had a bad time but I had to for this session, been here a couple times now and my orders have been pretty fine some hit or misses but overall nothing too severe. However this time I had an amazing time at the drive thru, the employee there had a wonderful attitude and instantly made my day with his compliment on my jacket and cheerful demeanor. Although fast food is always hit or misses he definitely made it a hit. Whoever was working today at the drive thru thanks for making my night!

As for the food its typical popeyes fair, what fast food operations do best is try to maintain consistency, they may have misses but what do you expect its fast food."}
{"text":"Always go this location and something is always wrong. 5 agents from the same job came to get food and every order was wrong. We all ordered mild and for spicy the one who ordered spicy got mild. None of the sides were right and they failed to remember the drinks! Very annoyed and I'm pregnant just wanted some chicken."}
{"text":"Seems decent enough for your average fast food place

See my picture for the poutine I ordered.... Food tasted okay... On the downside the guy didn't even offer to give me a receipt... But it seems many of these fast food places such as Tim Horton's is similar.. Service industry in Toronto sucks in general."}
{"text":"I went there on May 17th @ 12:40pm... placed my order at the Drive-Thru. I was on my lunch break. AFTER they accepted pmt at the window, I was told \"the wings are not ready...can you park, it will be a few mins.\" I sat there for TWENTY-SIX minutes. I called inside and asked for the Mgr. To the person on the phone I NICELY and CALMLY explained I had been waiting long and I was on a 30 min lunch break.\" She said \"your order is coming out now....my name is Hady, write my name on your receipt, and next time you come we'll replace the same order.\" I said \"o.k.\" Today, May 29th, It's pouring down rain,  I arrive at Drive-Thru. I nicely said \"Hi, Hady told me to bring my receipt to get my order replaced.\" The GHETTO window operator said \"we cant place no order at drive thru!! It's raining so I pull up to the window. No other cars behind me or anything.  She came to the window ANGRY...I heard her saying \"I TOLD her to come IN...SIDE!!! And aggressively opened the window like she wanted to do something to me lol. I nicely said \"I just wanted to ask since it's raining can I place my order, I have the receipt?\" She said \"no you gotta come inside and do it at the register.\" O.k...I go inside. Restaurant is EMPTY @ 8pm..one man leaving. A woman comes to counter in a Mgr uniform. She stands way off to the side to talk to me. No greeting or ANYTHING. I could tell by her body language and before I even said anything...whatever I wanted or anything would be a no lol. I said \"hi, the mgr Hady told me to bring this receipt b/c of what happened.\" Right away she said \"we dont have a Mgr named Hady.\" I said \"is it Sady then? \"No we dont have Mgr named Sady.\" I said \"is it close to that?...what are the Mgrs names?...cause on the phone that was her name...I was def told to bring my receipt for the long wait on my lunch break.\" \"I cant give out that info...we dont have a Mgr w/ that name.\" I said will you honor what I was promised on this date on this receipt?( She wouldnt even look at the receipt) She just said we dont have a Mgr named that.  I said what is your name? My name is \"Alicia.\" And your Mgrs name? His name Felix.\" I was done at that point. I nicely said \"people like YOU will be doing chicken forever! and walked out. I wasnt trying to get over...AT ALL. I dont need to lie for a $7.47 meal!!! It was the principal.  I'm a Customer Service Supervisor myself. I feel GREAT inside and it reflects outside of me. I truly enjoy making people happy. I look for reasons to make things simple and put a smile on your face. Probably some stealing going on there. These franchise owners will realize their loss when they are in the negative. That place USED to be busy a while back. The WRONG type of ppl there now. I've been buying Popeyes since New York. I will take my Amex ELSEWHERE. CERTAIN KINDS OF PEOPLE have no common sense, no business etiquette, no class and NOTHING ELSE!! It is SAD. We will see how long this one will be there if no changes are made!! It is obvious with the traffic flow...things are declining."}
{"text":"So, I'm looking for a quick meal. And I thought to myself whats inexpensive, but the quality is pretty good, so Popeye's came to mind. I went to the closest Popeye's near UNLV. I will never go there again. To begin with, one of the staff persons was mopping the floor while food is being prepared, I am no health inspector but I think its a health hazard, it provided an unsafe environment for the worker who were all just wearing tennis shoes. Second, the cashier asked me if I wanted spicy or mild chicken, i told her mild. She said that I'd have to wait 15 minutes for the mild chicken, so I said fine just give me spicy. I also ordered an apple pie, which she forgot to give me, until I asked her for it and said she didn't put on the original reciept. Anyway, I am a fan of Popeye's but not this location."}
{"text":"I been at this location twice for some fried juicy chicken. There offering is slightly different than Brampton locations as they always carry one different special. There spicy chicken also taste more spicier which is good!

Area: The area is nice and has plenty of seats. Parking is not a problem as its around Vaughan Mills.

Staff: The staff was quick to order and served fresh off the fryer. The staff was good to let us know when our strips were ready and brought it to the table.

Food:  The food was hot and spicy they way I like it. These guys are not cheap on ketchup and napkins as well. 

Its a good location to go and enjoy some Louisiana's Chicken!"}
{"text":"I love their deep fried Louisiana Juicy chicken.

This location is decent and has good seating area. There is also parking on site.

The cashier service was great and the food was ready served. The food was fried right and tasted as good as always! but seems like they have reduce the portion size, the chicken piece are smaller now.

On a separate note they have increased their daily special prices, so buyer beware! and their daily special are not that good any more.

See you eating some fried chicken!"}

The cashier service was decent and the food was ready served. The food was fried right and tasted as good! Their chicken pieces are crispy and not crazy watery like KFC and not as salty as KFC. I love their burgers as the Bun is quite nice. I also love the strips and usually get them on the side!
Ohhh wait for it..... THE FRIES ARE TO DIE FOR!

If you are into fried stuff you would like this place. I do prefer this location over the heartland currently as its bigger and for some reason the pieces have shrinked in the Heartland location. 

See you eating some fried chicken!"}
{"text":"This my friend is a smaller location and not recommend for very big groups for sit ins. I love my favorite fried Louisiana Juicy chicken.

Lets get down to logistics:

The location: In a plaza, for me it was in middle of nowhere as I was driving from Mississauga and stop but to get there strips. There were Train tracks and quite a few stores in the area.

The Shop: smaller size and there is enough to seat about 15 to 18 people. The place was kept clean. The men washroom was clean.

The staff: is friendly, nice and quick to execute. 

Parking: Plenty of parking as its in a plaza

Now the Food: Their chicken pieces were crispy and hot.Their fires were out from the fryer hot!"}
{"text":"I am not sure what is going on with Popeyes but no matter the location the quality is just not there, the service is terrible we were ordering and the lady repeated our order back and we corrected her because she got the size of the red beans and rice wrong and she said with a rude attitude that's what i said, at that point i knew we should of pulled off then. Get home the chicken is dry the orders are wrong and we didn't even feel like driving back. Oh and to add to the mistakes they made they didn't even get the right soda with my order, and they were out of almost all of the sauces to their chicken strips thank goodness we had ranch and wing sauce at the house. I just don't know what happened i use to love popeyes but they are not the same as they use to be or maybe just the midwest has better popeyes than here in vegas...."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of this Popeyes, my order is wrong more than right, non spicy when i order spicy, wrong chicken selections thn i ordered, runny mashed potatoes, old biscuits, dry chicken. I have noticed the popeye's that are in gas stations lack the quality that the stand alones have. The lady that has taken my order a few times seems like she does not understand english well which leads me to repeating my order time and time again. Also what happened to the strawberry jelly!!! I actually have started to just do an extra commute to go to the stand alone popeyes because i am that disatisfied with this location. Get it together"}
{"text":"I never in a million years thought I would ever give Popeyes a good review. It seems like no matter the location the service is bad and/or my order is wrong. Well today is the day Popeyes gets a good review from me. So on the 3rd of July we ordered at the window about 30 mins before closing we had to give our order 2x at the speaker then we get to the window and the manager tells us the girl didn't get our order and asks for it again and apologizes. She then says due to the long wait she is giving us a discount on our food. We hear her tell her crew our order se hands is our order and says sorry again. We get home the order is completely wrong we call back and speak with her on the phone she sounds just as disappointed as us that the order was not right and apologized again and took my name and advised when we come back she will make our order again. Fast forward to today July 10th we advise the people at the window. Our order was going to be replaced they asked us to pull to the window the manager (now forgive me because I am probably spelling it wrong) Klyshaun greeted us with a smile apologized again and went over our order with us again and made sure it was correct! Thank you Popeyes for finally hiring someone who has amazing customer service skills she is a keeper!"}
{"text":"I was away from my neighborhood helping a friend move but wanted for dinner what my family eats EVERY Tuesday. So while in North Las Vegas my friend directed me here. I went through the drive thru and ask for \"Two specials, mild and a pie, and I want that same order twice.\" The cashier says back to me, \"You will have to pay for them both together.\"  I responded that I understood and let him know that I didn't mean separate orders but  that I was saying it like that because my child an I will be eating in the car and I wanted us each to have our own individually wrapped order.  (Its easier to just give her a bag than to hand her some pieces while I'm driving) I added 1/2 dozen biscuits and a corn on the cob to my order and asked for lots of \"grape jelly, hot sauce and butter.\" My friend says after I completed my order that we can eat at her house.  So we drove back to her house and opened the bag to find ONLY two 2 piece orders! Also the two apple pies had been smashed open under the weight of the chicken packked into the small handle bag that my order was given to us in. I was upset at myself because I thought that maybe I wasn't clear when I ordered.  I just decided to eat and go ahead and get home. I kid you NOT today I'm doing laundry I take out the change and reciept from my jeans I had on that day and guess WTF they did charge me for 4 two piece specials!! I had to research the phone number since it is not on my receipt, but I've tried calling the store to say what happened and no one will answer the phone. I live near Henderson its not like I'm going to drive to NLV to talk! I asked  a friend if I should care anymore, you know I asked if he thought I was being dramatic over $2.58 worth of chicken and he said \"yes.\" But, the more I think about it the madder I get because if I walked into Popeye's packed up food and just walked out the door with 4 pieces of chicken they would call the police and pursue me no matter how far!"}
{"text":"I have to say the service in this place is really slow. I've been here 5 minutes now and still haven't placed an order. The crazy part is there is no one in line.  
    Ok, so I just ordered and they don't even have any sides other than mashed potatoes and fries. 
    How is service so slow in a place that is not even busy?"}
{"text":"Every time I come here they mess up the order then they blame me!  The staff hardly speak English here."}
{"text":"I went in there because I wanted some fried stuff. I looked at the window and saw that they had Garlic Peper Wicked chicken for 6 dollars! I asked them if I can have it but they said they we're out. So I went back home. Then next week I come back and ask again and still they don't have it. I did not want to waste gas so I just bought 3 piece and 5piece thigh. The outside was very crispy and the inside was juicy and flavourful. If it was just the chicken I would have given it a 5 or so but because of the wicked chicken and the bathroom there (bathroom was disgusting) I gave it a 3."}
{"text":"So I decided to stop by after a long day of work it was about 9:15pm, I ordered chicken tenders with a side of Cajun fries, oh and a small side or Cajun rice. I sat in the drive thru for approximately 5 minutes, thenI drove home (which was about 5 minutes away) only to realize my food was NOT fresh, the fries were terrible, my chicken wasn't even lukewarm. I was so upset with my order (but far too tired to drive back). This location gives Popeyes a very bad name. I still can't believe how terrible the food was. I plan on calling corporate tomorrow morning."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would went thru the drive through and drove home got there to only realize they not only didn't give me the French fries with my meal they didn't give me any sauce. Why ask if your not going to provide so ridiculous. I will never ever return to this location they really need to get there act together"}
{"text":"Good grief 0 stars is more appropriate. Every now and then fried chicken is a good thing. It should be noted that this particular Popeyes restaurant is located in a gas station. Note to self: gas station chicken served by illiterate idiots is dangerous. At any rate we ordered an 8 piece spicy chicken only meal. The clerk, in pigeon English says \"we ain't got no spicy wing\" so we say \"ok fill the box.\"

On the way home the car started to have a burned smell to the point I thought it was overheating. Well, it turns out that the chicken was so burned that it stunk up the car. When we got home, the chicken looked all withered and dark brown. One bite of breast demonstrated that it was severely burned. We had to throw the entire box of chicken in the dumpster. Cats won't come near this sludge.

The health department will be notified.

Do not go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love Popeyes so when I heard a Popeyes was being built near my area i was excited. Then a few months passed Popeyes open and I came here a few times and while the food here is good and the chicken can be hit or miss they don't have any ongoing deals that's advertised on TV like the Tuesday special or any other deals or new menu items that other Popeyes locations have while I still see this Popeyes stay in don't see it lasting or getting alot of business for much longer will still come by every now and then just disappointed that they don't have any deals."}
{"text":"This location is the absolute worst with respect to customer service. Have waited over 25 mins for a family meal on 3 separate occasions with 10-15 other orders being filled before mine even though they were people who ordered after me. I highly suggest you avoid this location at all costs. Management has no concern for customer service and highly disorganized. Would give 0 stars if possible."}
{"text":"What food we received was good for a fast food restaurant.  We ordered Popcorn Shrimp, Loaded Chicken Wrap, 3 piece Chicken dinner, fries and biscuits.  I got asked to pull around front.  I waited about 8 minutes the food was dropped off without a word.  I got home to find out our 3 piece meal wasn't in the bag.  Double check your bags before you leave."}
{"text":"Attempted to get food from here 3 times over 6 months.... First 2 times food was wrong and chicken was not breaded and cooked properly. I know procedures were not followed due to my own and family experience store managing and market managing another reputable  fried  chicken establishment.... 3rd time - I waited 8 minutes before greeted in drive thru order com... The tactfulness of the greeting was poor and also ended with me waiting another 5 minutes... They were out of strips.. I could have backed out if informed much earlier before others got in line behind me minutes later..... I then was stuck in line... 2 cars ahead a gentlemen order had been messed up so he returned through drive thru and this caused a 20 minute wait ( just for home to leave after I decided not to order.... I also could see the food handlers not following sanitary protocols via the large windows in the front... The last car in front took almost another 5 minutes to the second to receive food.... It was a very aggravating experience that lasted almost 40 minutes.... 858 to 937pm.... Never again........"}
{"text":"This was our first time ever and WOW totally unorganized. Waited over an hr total to order and get to go. After waiting in the drive through for 30 mins they said to go inside it would be faster NOT AT ALL. Mine and others food was wrong. Both pop machines were broke tea and water were only options and no discount to any customers for this and the wait and the wrong orders. We were super excited that this location opened and is right by the house. Some major things need to change or there won't be any customers. Also, the sides said large for a 12 piece meal w sides to feed a family of 4 definitely not big enough for the money spent"}
{"text":"Monday 7/30/2012, the Manager is only about 25 years old and his staff is on average 16 years old. The staff is a little lost on idea of multitasking but, they work very hard. Way harder than the manager. He does not know how to get his hands dirty or respond to customer complaints. Popeyes needs to hire an adult."}
{"text":"I have 2 other Popeye's location within a 5 km radius in my house. But this location does their chicken best. I don't know why.

You see me here almost every Tuesday. This is my default location of choice"}
{"text":"Ordered a 16 piece in drive thru and when I arrived home I found 3 breasts 3 thighs 2 legs and 6 wings. Called and asked if this was a normal occurrence shouldn't it be 4 4 4 and 4 and I was told yes but if we are low we substitute. I asked shouldn't I be offered the chance to wait until they had enough. Manager said yes but I wasn't  offered that choice. The manager did offer to make it right but I had to go back to the store. I went back with receipt and I stood to the side while the three customers in front of me were waited on while I'm waiting a young man came to the side of the counter as well who was dining in and politely waited for some sauce he stood there for 5 minutes totally ignored and they finally asked me can I help you and I said can you help this young man he's been waiting forever and I'm sure his food is cold. The only reason I'm giving a 2 is because the manager made it right but I had to go out of my way to make this happen. I think it's a staffing issue and a training issue. I for one was disappointed"}
{"text":"I am a Popeye's fan from way back. I've visited this location several times and the food has not disappointed but the service has never been great. Though my visit prior to today came with a show. The customer in front of me apparently had his order messed up, so I checked my bag before I left. They did fine that day. 
Today they were lacking in overall customer service. Aside from the pleasant guy who took my order, no one else seemed happy to have a job. I wasn't asked if I wanted any sauces with my almost 50 dollar order and they didn't give me the bisquits that should have been included. She gave me honey though. 
I attempted to call four times and the phone simply rang and then hung up each time.
After we finished eating I drove my very unhappy self back to the store. 
The manager, Corina, I belive is her name insisted the phone never rang. I offered to show her my cell phone as proof. 
She asked me what I expected her to do. 
I explained that I had driven all the way back. What did she think I  deserve since they had not given me my bisquits the first time.
She handed me my bisquits and said she would speak to the staff. 
I doubt I will ever go back. I will miss the food. But bad service, bad management and rudeness is no way to earn my money. 
Corporate will hear from me also."}
{"text":"Staff was extremely rude and do not look well groomed. I asked her if I could change my order before I even gave her any money and she rudely said \"no\" definitely won't be back"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I have came to this location and the food taste like rubber. The mashed potatoes tasted like beans. I would never recommend anybody or animal to eat at this location cause it is far the worst food in arizona. I should have had a bowl of my dogs food cause it would have tasted 100 times better than the food here."}
{"text":"Staff needs better training or at least get some workers that actually some what care about their job. Have had issues with carelessness on their behalf on a couple of occasions."}
{"text":"Chicken is good.  But the service here is damn slow.    Everyone here looks sleepy and they don't even answer your question here sometimes.   If there is a survey from Popeyes I would vote down for this one!!"}
{"text":"We needed something like this to open here. The Wendy's next door has lousy customer service and wait time for food was ridiculous . Wendy's is now paying the price and popeyes is thriving . With that said , popeyes is the bomb . Try their waffle chicken it's great ."}
{"text":"Ok. Popeyes is a fast food chain whose menu rarely changes. Someone please explain how it takes 20 mins in a drive thru. Now if i knew customers were waiting that long for pre cooked food my customer service would be stellar. Not the case at this location. A bunch of kids, and you can tell its their 1st job, so no pride or sense of well anything other than the montone welcome to popeyes. If that wasnt enough my order is never correct....thighs are not the same as breasts, no utensils to eat my sides with. Sorry to say NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a few blocks from my house and I visit it often.  In all my years going to popeyes I've never experienced the service I experienced today. I order 24 cajun wings waited 15 min for them to drop them fresh only to get home and they be undercooked. I took the wings back they advised they would drop new wings and to wait another 15 mins. Got the second batch of wings home and they were the same wings they just refried them. Long story short the 2nd batch were disgusting and no answer when I called the restaurant. Will filing a complaint with corporate and the BBB. Never purchasing from them again."}
{"text":"Guess I should have read the reviews before I decided to try out this location.  I can't comment on the food since I left without ordering.

When I arrived I noticed the place looks a bit run down on the outside.  Upon entering, I was the third in line to order.  There were also two people waiting for their food.  There was only one person waiting on customers inside and one person working the drive-thru.  When I arrived there were no cars in the drive-thru.  Yet the young lady whose was standing by the drive-thru window never attempted to help her co-worker, even though it was apparent they were busy inside.

The young lady working inside was also having a conversation with the person who was first in line to order.  After waiting about 4 minutes in line, I decided to cut my losses and leave, which I did.  So I did not place an order.

The service level at this location seemed to be disjointed at best.  There was no sense of urgency that they were running way behind.  When I left two more individuals had joined the line waiting to order.  So there were now 4 people waiting to order and 2 waiting for their food.  

From my experience and the other reviews it is apparent that this location needs to address their service level.  It does not seem to have improved at all.  Guess they don't really care about losing business."}
{"text":"I love Popeyes since I was in California.   This was the worst drive thru experience. Very unprofessional when taken order.  Customers services is the most important thing in any business.  I guess they don't take it seriously.  Train ur staffs well before letting  them run the store.  If the owner or manager is reading this. Please take this into consideration."}
{"text":"Don't even bother coming here for lunch. Only person in line was me. 6 people standing by waiting for their food. 4 people back there just looking at me not one word said for 10 minutes so I left. Say far far away. It's an urban myth to call this \"fast food\""}
{"text":"I guess this location is comparatively new, because everything here is clean and well maintained. Although, the place is not so big, it's still good for groups. 
My favourite item here is biscuits, which I prefer to have with honey on a side. Very good for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I love Popeyes. Can't expect a fast food type place to be five star. I would rate this five star but every time I come here the staff is ridiculously rude and unwelcoming. I always ignore it because HEY it's fast food. But after my last experience I really will not be returning (at least to this location)...Too many attitude issues and no customer service. There was a line of three (including me) waiting at the counter for ten minutes (not over exaggerating), not to order... But for CONDIMENTS. We tried getting the attention of workers and even the MOD. No luck. You can't expect much at places like this but even McDonald's is attentive to waiting guests who want something simple like ranch dressing. These people treated us like we were so rude to have the audacity to interrupt their texting to ask for utensils. You know, since my dine in meal was bagged to-go and not served with any plates, utensils, or condiments like honey jam or hot sauce. Love Popeyes but refuse to spend any money at this location."}
{"text":"This location is a disgrace to the Popeye's chain, I just wasted $30 on a 12 piece family meal and received no chicken breasts. The rest of the (all dark meat) chicken was so over cooked it was dry and disgusting.  I would have taken the entire order back if I lived closer.  Took forever to have my order taken at the drive through only to receive incorrect side dishes.  Apparently staff couldn't count either as I received 12 biscuits instead of 6.  They also had me pay and then tried to charge me for the next customer's order thinking they'd already given me my food. Will never go to this location again, total disappointment."}
{"text":"Great service l,  cashier he was really helpful and nice the food was hot and it tasted so good,"}
{"text":"This place is an anomaly.  It's the one place where no matter how much attitude I get from the staff the food is so awesome and fresh every time I go that I can't help but go back.   The shrimp tackle box is one reason I go besides of course some of the best biscuits in fast food and maybe food in general.  I like that they always have some new experimental product every 6-8 weeks from prawns to new chicken or side dishes.  That really keeps things interesting and fresh.  Their pop machine is always missing half the options, it's like bread but no butter, cereal and no milk.  It's a mix it yourself pop machine with all the flavors and options.  If you're around there go, but don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"This isn't great food--not even close.  But it's one of several options on the walk home after classes, and when I'm not in the mood to cook this seems to be where I end up most often.  I like fried chicken, and when I want fried chicken, this does the job."}
{"text":"This new location is much nicer than the previous one, the service is great, nice decor, excellent staff and most of all the quality of the food"}
{"text":"I've been here five times and only one time was it a bad experience. Looking back on that time, it was very busy and the counter person was overwhelmed. However overall there's been good service and good food the rest of the time. This time I ordered the 16 piece family meal, it comes with your choice of three sides (I got red beans, mash/gravy and Cajun fries) The order arrived fast, nothing was missing, and it tasted good. Pretty much everything you could hope for from a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Anywhere on Boulder Highway/Russell is normally not my first choice to eat but on this occasion I really did not have a say in the matter and I was sort of curious as I have never had Popeyes. 

I ordered up some chicken tenders and a side of mashed potatoes.  Some of the tenders looked like tenders and some of them where compressed in such a way that they resembled chicken flavored straws.  The consistency of the mashed potatoes was satisfactory but the gravy was bland.

Oh ya....The flour flake puck that comes with the meal is a joke."}
{"text":"This is a new location. All of the new locations in Las Vegas do not have the traditional 2 piece special on Tuesdays. But, this store was very clean. The food was very fresh and my order came up in less than 5 minutes.  The customer service was excellent.  The staff is friendly and patient  (the person I came with takes a moment to order)."}
{"text":"I love Popeye's. This location has never gotten my order right. Some times I get white meat when I ask for dark. Sometimes I am missing a side item. Sometimes they give me different sides than the ones I ordered. I've been here four times now and never ever gotten my order exactly as I ordered it. Very frustrating. 

The pros:
- good food
- friendly staff
- clean, nice-looking location 

If they can just get the most important part correct - giving the customer what they ask for - then this would be a five star Popeye's."}
{"text":"Always liked Popeyes Chicken and stopped by this location last week to get some chicken to go. It was a complicated order and I was sure they were going to mess it up but when we got it home and looked everything was perfect.

The young Hispanic gal running the register and preparing orders needs a raise."}
{"text":"I've always loved Popeyes and wished I lived by one. Now I do and we ate there last night. Drive through was extremely busy but the line moved quickly. Got home with a large complicated order and it was all correct. Food was fantastic.

Only negative was that they didn't have any spicy wings which are my favorite.

Happy we now have a Popeyes and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I love Poyeye's!  More spicey and much more varity than a KFC.  Chicken, fish and shrimp - it's all good."}
{"text":"The worst fast food experience of my life. 

1.  My food was going to take a few minutes I was told. They asked me to pull over. No problem. After 15 minutes I went back into the restaurant to see if my order fell through the cracks. Then I was told their screens had a glitch. No one said anything. And the order was keyed in improperly. 

2.  When I finally received my order, there were 4 mistakes out of 6. And I was there standing when she packed it. And the order was packed improperly. 

I then asked for a refund. 

3.  The manager was a nightmare. Clearly she should still be behind a register and not in a managerial position because as she was praising her workers she was dissing customers. They don't keep the doors open. Customers do. And by that I use for an example the fact that my food was sitting on the counter, she was in the midst of trying to find my chicken receipt, customers were requesting their order and was asked what the food was on the counter and she replied, \"I have no idea\", which at this point after her helping several customers more I shouted, \"it's the refund\" over the din of the crowd. 

No one should have to put up with this at a chicken joint. 

Change up your staff. And I don't need or want an apology. You'll be happy to know I won't be back. 

She chastised ME in front of customers"}
{"text":"Where do I even start? I should have read the reviews prior to going here. The lady in the commercials deceived me for sure. First, they asked us to drive up to the side so they could finish the order with no cars behind us (???). They asked us what sauces we wanted just to forget them. Gave me the wrong side so then we went in to get utensils, the correct side and the sauces. Mac and cheese was cold and/or still partially frozen because there was water in the bottom of it. The chicken was slightly warm and I ate that. Biscuit was a sodium hockey puck. I honestly don't have high expectations for fast food because yes it's fast food but come on!! Get it together."}
{"text":"Perfect popeyes. Fresh food. Quick service. The chicken sandwiches are always fresh! Wait times are short. WiFi.  Clean tables. Better then the other popeyes locations."}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss. I usually go for tenders i have got home more time then not to find them not done and very pink with batter falling off in your hands. For sure a food poisoning meal. The pop is totaly flat as no one checks carbonation.New trainees behind counter unsupervised at busy times. All in all terrible."}
{"text":"In spite of reviews, I took a chance with this Popeyes. There are no Popeyes in our town so we like to indulge in it when we can.

Reviews were accurate. Ordered through drive through, asked to pull forward and wait, WAITED, manager brought food to car, bragged about how he loaded us up with everything we could ever need for our meal, drove to our destination to eat in car, had no plastic ware for our red beans and rice! He talked all of that smack and didn't deliver. I tore a corner of the box that the chicken came in and made a make shift fork. And the food was not tasty by the way.

Will bypass this joint the next time I visit Charlotte."}
{"text":"Big fan of this location. Service was very friendly and helped us pick our meal!! Food was fantastic and the ambience brought the whole experience to another level. I had a phenomenal time and recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Every. Single. Time we come, we sit in the drive through for 10+ minutes. There is no excuse for this. We just sat in the drive through for 16 minutes, ONLY CAR IN THE DRIVE THROUGH. And we were told by the shift manager that they were \"understaffed\", but in 105° weather, sitting in our car sweating...that is INSANE. I've given this place so many chances and I'm done."}
{"text":"This location is down the street from my job & I stop in from time to time on my way to work.  It use to be my favorite place to eat in the Showcase Mall,  however, the last few visits have been very disappointing. 
In the past,  the night crew were young men who always had a smile & acted grateful for the business. The staff during my last few visits are older women ( younger than my 60 years,  but older than the young men of past  visits). The lady at the counter acts as if every order is a punishment to her . No smile, no thank you ....no customer service skills at all.  
Although the food is still good, this will be my last visit to this location.
I'm too old to pay for poor service when other choices are steps away."}
{"text":"Dude gave me a super bad attitude cause So ordered large fries and they didn't have any ready. Seemed pretty upset about me willing to wait for them."}
{"text":"Luke warm food, long wait, watery coleslaw. And does this look like 1/4 lb of shrimp to you? Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"I've stopped here to grab lunch for the fam a few times. Service has always been good. My only gripe is apparently this location doesn't participate in the Tuesday 2 PC chicken special. It's so odd because I thought every Popeyes does the same deals. Oh well. Either way, I prefer Popeyes over the other \"fried chicken\" place. Lol. Their popcorn shrimp is delish. My kids love it! And I love their mashed potatoes and Cajun rice."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and each time was a pleasant experience. Now, we've never been through the drive through which apparently catches hella flack on here lol but the service inside isn't bad. The place is clean. Bathrooms were clean. This is always a wash you're hands after type of meal. Out of all the fast food chicken joints Popeye's is the best imo especially their red beans & rice and their tea. I also like their biscuits and the fact that the food is always hot."}
{"text":"Almost 3 years in and out of Canada and I have never tried Popeyes. 

I still wish that was the case."}
{"text":"So excited to have Popeye's in Scottsdale!!! Went today and it was delicious as expected! Never going to KFC again!!!! Tuesday's you get 2 piece for under $2! And the Naked (no breeding) chicken tenders are off the charts... And a little spicy! Their mashed potatoes are better then most fancy places... I am already and fried chicken addict... But now it's close by... I am in so much trouble!!!"}
{"text":"If you want the ghettoest experience of your life , you have to visit this place... they must put these people in a social experiment and make them watch themselves later on... and this comes after we have 0 expectations from popeyes in general ... :D"}
{"text":"Popeyes overall is one of the few fast food places I'll consistently eat at. Although the food is (for the most part) the same - what sets each location apart is the service. The chicken is delicious. The spices, the blend, the crispness all perfected. The fries are probably some of the best fast food fries around (however they aren't amazing in a poutine since the flavour of the fries, cheese and gravy compete too much - though it's probably still worth trying if you're a poutine lover). Their gravy goes nicely with their mashed potatoes for that reason where the potato and the gravy aren't competing with one another. About this particular location though - they're not particularly fast at their service (depending on when you go - some employees are definitely better workers than others). If you get the few at this location that actually care about their turnaround time - you might get good service but the few weak links in the chain usually break the service. Management needs to work on keeping a more consistent experience for customers and know which workers are hurting the overall customer experience. Go here because Popeyes is awesome and hope that you get lucky with who serves you until management can figure out how to make a more consistent experience and staff appropriately for busy times."}
{"text":"We have been going there since they opened but not any more.  First they had a lady that could not figure out the machine and she turned it over to a man that was some better. We ordered mild and the manager said it would be 10 minutes and I said ok.  So we waited 20 minutes and it still was not up. The othe man said it was ready so I  picked up the box and left, my fault for not checking.  When we got home we had 3 piece spicy and cold.  We paid for 5 pieces.  They seem to be out of mild all the time. We are wiping them off."}
{"text":"Foods great was fresh and piping hot. I think they're understaffed though because the poor workers seem really overwhelmed. Its a busy place. Will be back though service was good food was great."}
{"text":"This place has definitely improved since it first opened.  But I continued coming here since i love Popeye's. I've seen marked improvement. They're good about getting orders out fast. I would like to see them continue to use numbers when calling out orders instead of names because I have experienced that confusion first hand in the past.

For local Gilbert residents, they often offer coupons in the mail... another reason I continue to return."}
{"text":"With all the wonderful commercials for this chain I assumed the food half way decent . If wal-mart had a food court in hell this would be the quality of the food . Nice , professional staff here but we threw away most of the $27 dinner . The fish , if it was fish was a sliver of a fish stick , the popcorn shrimp would need dental records to I.D. It at a murder scene . Both were horrible , tasteless , over fried , bad oily tasting and a new level of horrible \"seafood .\" If you like burned motor oil breading taste  this is perfect . The pigeon , I mean chicken was tiny , over cooked and tasteless . Get a better quality of food . You couldn't pay me to eat this crap again . Nothing here \" tastes like chicken \" . I needed to eat something after I left to get the taste out of my mouth , Damn !!!!"}
{"text":"So just left... I had a good day until.. I got a 16 piece and ended up with 15.. asked for plates and ended up with none... and a piece of chicken that was Bitten!!!!!!!!! Wtf!!!!!"}
{"text":"This location is now back open. The interior has been updated but, the chicken is still as good as ever!

Be prepared for long lines as I think this is the only open Popeye's currently in Pittsburgh. Every time I have gone by since they have reopened they have been packed."}
{"text":"Only car in drive thru I ordered my food they said hold a sec I waited 5 minutes no one got back to me as I watched 2 other cars go ahead of me in the second drive thru lane finally I pulled up they were like oh my bad what did you order so I placed it again paid then pulled to next window for them to tell me they are out of what I ordered and I could either wait 10 minutes or they can give me something else ! Then to top it off they told Me to pull around and they would bring it out to Me after 15 minutes waiting someone comes out and ask are you waiting on something? OMG I had to tell this person my order again so now this makes 3 times I had to order just to get my food!! Clear lack of Management here  last time here was just as bad so I waited several weeks before coming back and now this! Won't be visiting this location ever again."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money.  My husband wanted to try the new spicy wings and spicy ranch they were advertising and the rude employee said they were out....of both.... I asked if the kids meals included a biscuit, he said no,bso I ordered extra for my kids.  Get the kids meals and there is a biscuit in the bags.  There was not a toy in their bags, another rude employee told me that if they are out of toys they give you a biscuit (that would have been nice to know when I asked) then she said but we have toys today.  

The biscuits were the best part of the meal and they were Okay......  I was so excited to have a Popeyes close, because the food and service can be so much better.  I will definately not be back!!"}
{"text":"What a difference a few weeks make!  I was contacted by Popeye's and they apologized, even offering a free meal.  I was told that the management had changed.  A few days ago I went back to this same location and ordered a family meal.  As I was waiting I asked if the management had been changed recently, and I received a very hearty YES!  Those couple of people behind the counter were not shy about sharing their comments, not in a rude way, but grateful that the management that was in place had been replaced.

My service was definitely much improved.  I did not take them up on the free meal.  I do not share my opinions for what I can get out of it in the short term, but to see the business change so that it might become a place that I would be happy to share my hard earned money.

Good job Popeye's!!!!"}
{"text":"LOOOOOOOOOOVVVVEEEEEE Popeyes. Great service, good price for the quality of food they produce. I recommend the spicy chicken strips, red beans and rice are bomb, and the cajun fries are crunchy with just the right amount of spice. The best sauce is sweet heat (beware it is pretty hot)."}
{"text":"It took a while to get our food but EDNA was the absolute BEST! She was clearly working under pressure and was SO kind and organized and worked as fast and efficient as she could."}
{"text":"Can't rate this place. I'm from the South n this place is not even in comparison with the Popeyes at home. It has no flavor at all. I will not be having anymore Popeyes until I get back to one heading home starting in Memphis and work my way down Hwy 61."}
{"text":"So when you click on a coupon and it has the address of the store on it you would expect it to be accepted at that location right? Wrong. Not only would they not honor it at that location the manager couldn't even explain why they wouldn't accept it. The coupon is good through the 31st of August 2015, hope everyone asks them to honor it."}
{"text":"Popeye's is Popeyes, so this review is for people who work at this particular location.

I came here for lunch on a Wednesday, and I was very impressed by the shift manager.  He looked friendly and full of energy, and I love how he hustled to pull in customers and get that extra sale, in a non-intrusive manner of course.  The operation looked smooth, and the workers seemed happy.  Not only was I entertained watching these folks work while I ate for 20 minutes, I learned a thing or two about how to run a highly functional team."}
{"text":"Last friday ordered 2 pc dinner MILD, got home the chicken was SPICY. This friday go back again, get 4 pc dinner and small fry, they hand me my bag. No small fry in the bag, tell her and she hands me a bag with basically nothing in it. Small fry comes in a tiny bag and it had 10 french fries in it. I could tell when she handed me it, it felt empty. Go in and ask for potatoes instead and show them the bag of fries that cost 1.99 (10 french fries). Acts like I did something wrong, go home to finally eat. Don't get me wrong their food is good, but the pricing and portions are to small for the price. Get home and open up the chicken to eat and there is 2 breasts in there so DRY and crust was hard as if it had been sitting in the warmer since NOON. This was 4 pm, the 2 thighs were ok, we couldn't even eat the breasts, they were so DRY!! I will not be eating here again, popeyes yes, on Alma school NO."}
{"text":"The Two for Tuesday is the best deal in town. I usually get two or three orders. However, DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT even attempt to try the chicken fingers. Probably the worse Chicken fingers I've ever tried. Taste like cardboard and the price is outrageous. If it weren't for the two for Tuesday deal, I may have given them 1-star. Sorry for the harsh review but I've tried the fingers twice and they are tough and hard to enjoy."}
{"text":"Broke ass equipment in the drive through with no notification so we sit there talking to a broken speaker. Had to repeat order four times to the retarded girl running the drive through. I checked the bag by the window and the forgot my biscuits, after telling me it was everything. Had to ask for them. Get home and they stiffed me on amount of chicken tenders. Tenders were 60% hard crusty, macaroni was mediocre and gummy, fries were basic, sweet tea was lukewarm with barely any ice. I can get the same family meal at churches for half the price, this shit meal cost me 40 bucks. Don't forget it's in a ghetto ass Plaza next to a run down food city with scummy looking people in the parking lot. Please, please avoid this utter shit location. I'll never visit a popeyes again."}
{"text":"I could not remember if I had ever visited a Popeye's before in the past.  If I had it must have been a forgettable experience and could have saved me approximately $8 today.  I was out and about running errands and realized I had not eaten yet.  I was on my way home and thought I would check out this location, because I had never has Popeye's....or so I thought.

I cruised into the drive-thru and was met with a voice on the other end of the squawk box purely going though the motions.  I ordered a #7.  This consists of three fingers, a side (I chose fries), and a drink.

I was pleasantly surprised when I pulled up to the window, I thought the lad did his best.  He was polite and courteous when he told me they did not take American Express (all about the points), I gave him cash instead.  Another lad asked me if I would like some dipping sauce with my meal.  He was also polite and handed me my dipping sauce.

Off I went....When I arrived at my domicile, and opened the box, I discovered where chicken fingers and fries went to die.  Every bite was cold and tasted of a chicken finger and fry graveyard.  I felt soulless and empty as I ate my soulless and empty meal.  I even mixed up my own version of a garlic and ranch sauce trying to play Dr. Frankenstein while attempting to resurrect my meal.  Alas, nothing could save it.

Prior to writing this, I conducted a search of my previous reviews and discovered I had indeed eaten at another Popeye's location.  I did not like it.  I do not like this location either.  Based on two reviews of the franchise, I am sure I will never dine at another.  With other chicken finger locations in the valley....that are good and some great, NO MORE POPEYE'S."}
{"text":"I don't remember Popeyes chicken tenders tasting that horrible! I ordered a 5 piece spicy chicken tenders. The chicken was dry and it was mostly breading, that was stale tasting. I would skip this Popeyes and try a different one!"}
{"text":"Extreamly slow and disorganized.  Workers look like lifeless, unemotional zombies.  No communication between staff and management.  Cashier chewing gum like a cow chewing her cud."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of fine dining. That's gotta be my disclaimer before writing a Popeye's review...

But when I get an urge for crispy deep fried perfection, there is no reason to call on KFC.

Do yourself the favour and get your chitlin and grease urge satiated by Popeye's. So freakin' good.

Highlights: Spicy Chicken, biscuits, mashed taters with chicken gravy."}
{"text":"For far too long the Popeye's nearest to North Central Phoenix was located at 67th Avenue and Peoria and unfortunately I've made that drive far too many times when craving some delicious spicy fried chicken and red beans and rice. That's why I was so excited when I saw that this former KFC location was converting to a Popeye's.

I stopped in the other night to pick up dinner for the family and had a great experience. First, because I know my kids don't want spicy, you can ask them to split the pieces between spicy and mild. Second, the cost of the family meal was actually $4 less than what it said on the menu. And finally, service was very prompt and fast. 

It does still look as if the front parking lot is under construction so parking is a bit congested, but other than that this is a great new addition to the North Central / Sunnyslope area."}
{"text":"Ok, I am a fan of Popeye's but my visit today was very lacklustre.  The girl behind the counter was loud and seem to think it ok to leaan against the wall while answering customer questions.  Was not friendly or helpful at all.  I have been here before and had far better service."}
{"text":"Needs a negative star!  Drive thru slow and food greasy.  Made me pee out of my butt didnt even think that was possible. Never again I say never again"}
{"text":"If there's a negative star I'd do that,  but unfortunately,  I need to put a rating just so I could write a review, every single time that we take out food from this place they always mess it up! They always get it wrong and it's annoying,  one time we just let it go cause it's too much effort and gas just to go back and have our order replaced.  It's annoying."}
{"text":"The worst chicken I have ever had. The breast tenders had so much batter, it was hard to find the chicken. The actual piece of chicken was as thin  as a piece of paper. They were so salty I couldn't even eat them. The green beans were just as bad. They were canned and had some kind of a gravy sauce on them. Disgusting!!! It was my first visit there and will definately be my last.To top it off, they got my order completely wrong I found out when I got home. I had to drive back to get the right order and ended up with what I just described."}
{"text":"2nd visit. 1st time was very good across the board. Service and food quality was great. This visit not so much. Ordering was a journey. 3 of the cashiers were with one customer for a extended amount of time. Ordered 2 three piece meals to go. When we opened the boxes it was not similar at all. Totally different contents. Obviously disappointed. Will go back but will check contents there before leaving."}
{"text":"Pos team made me wait 20 min for a terrible meal. I inquired why it was taking so long and they ignored me. Never coming back, never recommending."}
{"text":"This place is great. Made an order. The one guy screwed up. But another guy came rushing out to call me back into the store to finish my order.

Over all I would say this place is the best pop eyes in the area. Always nice."}
{"text":"This location can be a hit or miss as with any Popeyes location (as I've experienced). But occasionally I get a craving and it's often satisfied here with chicken or a biscuit! I would say that the biggest factor of quality is time. The time of day you walk into this store will greatly affect the quality of service you receive."}
{"text":"Gst the Jambalaya... i kno it aint the real deal. But its damn good for just $5. And it fills you up as well. The chicken is great cuz they add spice to it. And on Tuesdays they have 2 pieces for less than $2. Definetly something to grab if you are close."}
{"text":"Nice staff. Very friendly and accommodating. Place is clean and food are cooked just right. Weekly deals makes it more affordable"}
{"text":"I order the family tender meal and let me tell you everything was soooo good! Spot on and they gave us more than enough condiments. For the pricee and my family will be eating the family meals from Popeye's rather than kfc"}
{"text":"This place is a breath if fresh air from what i am used to. My usual which i have refused to enter smells of oil and fat and is just too dirty, this place was so clean and the chicken tasted clean. This is a great place to go. The tenders were fresh and tasty. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Keeping everything in perspective, you should know my wife and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Cajun/Creole food and have experienced the ultimate of Louisiana cuisine at places like Chef Paul Prudhomme's K Paul's Louisiana Kitchen in New Orleans, to far more modest establishments around the country... all of which still provided very enjoyable, tasty and authentic Cajun style food.

When we visited this Popeyes on July 9th, being fast food after all, we did not expect them to rival any of those other establishments, but hoped they'd at least provide a quick Cajun fix. Unfortunately they failed miserably on a few very key points  

I will start with the positive. The staff was very friendly and took our order for Blackened Chicken tenders, Red Beans & Rice and Cajun fries promptly and accurately at 3:11pm

Unfortunately it all went downhill from there. We received our order at 3:13pm, grabbed some napkins and by the time we got to our table less than a minute after receiving our order the food was cool (beans and fries) to barely lukewarm (chicken). 

We immediately went back to the counter (now approx 3:15pm) to tell them our food was cold. Again the staff was great and said they'd take care of it IMMEDIATELY. While we were waiting for our meal replacement I noticed a manager, advised him what happened and that he might want to check food temps to see if they met Health Code standards. He immediately went behind the counter and checked the temperature of the Blackened Chicken and Red Bean & Rice containers by touch (not a thermometer) and instructed the staff to pull the Cajun chicken from under the warmers. 

No doubt this was why at 3:26pm I was still waiting for our replacement order. A few minutes later our replacement food finally came and while warm enough to eat, it was not what we would consider to be \"freshly prepared hot\". In addition the Blackened Chicken was not spicy or \"crusty\" as is the case at any real Cajun/Creole restaurant. It frankly tasted like reheated precooked chicken dusted in bargain brand store bought Cajun spice mix.

In addition, the Cajun fries were a complete joke. For 1.99 we got a total of 16 fries in varying sizes... which works out to 12.4 cents apiece. Seriously... 16 fries for 1.99. The flavor was also so unappealing that even sharing the 16 fries between us there were still 3 left when we discarded our trash. Haven't these guys ever checked out their competition? Someone at Popeye's corporate needs to walk a block to the In N Out to see what the words Value, Hot, Flavorful and Consistent Quality really mean.

No doubt there are loyal Popeyes fans everywhere that will discount our opinion and they are entitled to theirs. This Popeyes is new and is perhaps not representative of the chain in general, but our experience was so unappealing we'll never give any Popeyes location our business. There are too many better tasting and higher quality choices available.

It's nice to see companies opening new locations because it creates jobs and we hope for that reason alone they get their act together and are able to stay in business."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for a popcorn shrimp order 
I mean I get that shrimp takes longer to make
But I literally saw the guy looking around for the shrimp only to find out 10 minutes later that the shrimp was already made all along 
Will not be back for the service"}
{"text":"I passed by here on the way to Winco and noticed this place is open now.  There's a drive thru and you can take your order to go or you can dine in. The prices are reasonable. I ordered an 8 piece meal which came with 8 pieces of chicken 1 large side and four biscuits just under $15. The chicken only is $10.39.  Got the mild flavor for Mr B. I tasted one wing and my thoughts are its okay nothing special. They don't measure up to the ones I get over at Johnny Mac's that's for sure.  I like the skin though it had a nice  crunch a slight garlic taste to it. The biscuits are pretty good.  Buttery. The potatoes with gravy is good. My family likes it. I'm a fan of their sweet tea though!

Service wise, everybody is still green. There was a slight confusion with my order. I was given a receipt and the number on cash receipt is different from the number for the chicken order that the cashier never handed to me. So I waited there for a while because number I had wasn't being called until they figured  out 5 minutes later.  

Parking lot is really small. On the drive thru side there's only one way to get out. It could be a pain in the butt trying to get out of there when it's really busy.

For the price value of the meals and for the convenience it's great for families.

Note: Lobby closes  and stops taking orders at 10pm but you can still get fried chicken till 11pm when you take your car through the drive-thru window."}
{"text":"12 bucks for a 3piece chicken meal is appalling since the 3 pieces were anemic & closer to dry chewy small dwarf drummettes. Service was friendly. But g-dam what a ripoff! I think it took me a total of 5 bites to kill all 3 pieces. Those commercials by Mama Popeye sure is a ponzi scam...

Signature Biscuit was decent & the sweet tea was refreshing.

If you gotta get your fix, bring your wallet, not your appetite."}
{"text":"We have been to this location a few times when it first opened and it was ok. They were new so small mistakes were made on my order but it was a small fix, so no big deal. 

This recent time I went made me so angry. I ordered my food at the drive-thru, I go to pay with cash and card, even asking her if that was ok. She gave me such an attitude, and was giving me dirty looks. I was so mad because that was all I had. She hands me my food I ask her for some honey and sauce, she rolled her eyes again and gave me the incorrect sauce. Her attitude was so unprofessional!

I get down to get the dipping sauce that I didn't receive, the lady at the register tells me to give her a minute and walks away. She was in the back getting other orders ready and helping other customers. Now I was already mad because of the lady at the window, but she had me standing for minutes to where I look out the front door and my mom is giving me hand sings is to what is taking so long. I get the sauce go back to the car and find out they gave me the wrong order. I will not be going back to this location!"}
{"text":"Always slow... even if you're the only one in line. Never have a polite worker. And occasionally get your order correct."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Came here for their Tuesday special and there were 10+ people in front of me. I expected at least a half hour wait (because I usually wait forever even though it's not that busy), but I was in and out of there in TEN MINUTES!  Aaaaand they have a drive-thru. Definitely coming back to this location if I ever want Popeyes. As for their chicken, tastes like Popeyes chicken! And if you want to compare, I prefer Popeyes chicken and mashed potatoes over KFCs. Not to mention they also have popcorn shrimp that's not bad to munch on."}
{"text":"Went to Popeyes for the first time today and was quite impressed with their chicken tenders and sides.  The service was good, restaurant was clean, and manager came out to the lobby and asked how our food was and if we needed anything.  The Cajun music also made it fun and jazzy.  

No complaints by any means from me."}
{"text":"The worst customer service at a franchise I have ever experienced. I got there at 10:25pm when they close at 11pm. When I arrived there were 24 fresh pieces of chicken and I ordered a 3 piece. They deliberately ignored me after my order, packed up all the chicken came back and told me they sold out to an uber eats order and that there is no more chicken. They literally sent me out the door so they could fulfil an UberEATS order. Learn how to manage your kitchen don't send away customers that specifically drove to your store to eat."}
{"text":"The food was good except the poutine. the service was awe full I ordered a Diet Coke and my friend ordered a nestea and I got the nestea and she got sprite will not be returning to this location"}
{"text":"I love this location the people are awesome and the food is to die for. The chicken is hot when you get it and the very crunchy outer coating is delicious. The Cajun fries are so good a new take on French fries"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. My wife & I decided to grab our dinner here today 5/29/18. I order my usual, the shrimp po boy and was told that the PO boy is not available to buy without buying the combo or platter . My wife says go head so I did. Then I get a 1/2 pound of popcorn shrimp and all of the shrimp is extremely hard. Manager wouldn't remake the shrimp, or give me my refund so I had to deal with brick hard shrimp.

Oh, my wife ordered the $3.99 meal and had to wait 20 minutes to get her food. We will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  However, my son and I were waiting to order when in front of us were two Popeye employees talking to each other for several minutes.  After they were done, they asked us if we were ready to order.  I would have given this location five stars if we didn't have to wait and if the tables were clean."}
{"text":"Really good fried chicken. A step up from KFC in my opinion. They have reasonable prices, good spices and they're biscuits are to die for. 3.5 stars considering it's a fast food chain."}
{"text":"I love the food but not their service, very slow and lots of mistakes!!! I feel disappointed that they seems have no training at all. I would continously support this company in other location, will not come back again."}
{"text":"They don't clean up tables so when u enter there are a bunch of greasy tables. Also ice machine doesn't work, so pop with one or two pieces ice is what u get. Very few fries given along with the combo. I Heard my order of tenders referred to as the tiny tenders more than once. They shouldn't put down their own food. Yup their portion size is small. Will avoid."}
{"text":"Ventilation could be improved. when we walked in there was a strong scent of oil in the air. It was not appetizing and so we left. I wont go again."}
{"text":"This is the only Popeyes location I've ever been to, and I've only gone through drive thru. The strips are SO yummy - nice and crispy! The mashed potatoes are better than KFC I think, but they are super small. The biscuits are where it's at though. My husband loves their fried chicken, but neither of us can handle the \"hot\" pieces."}
{"text":"We order from here as a treat once in a while.  Lady week I placed a take out order 5 chicken strip combo and a 3 chicken strip combo for myself.  I've never had a problem with my order until that night.  I didn't bother to check the order but when I got home I was pulling everything out when I discovered they Gabe me three wrong order.  Do you know how frustrating that is?!?! I was so pissed off.  Moral of the story...always check your order before you leave"}
{"text":"This place has really improved. It used to suck but lately the service is good and the food is delicious. I totally recommend it."}
{"text":"Never had bad Popeyes till today don't put no white mf in a black kitchen how you fuck up Coleslaw....chicken was wack food was cold  just mad i spent 20 on bullshit ik next time if I have to pass thru TA to just keep it moving lbs"}
{"text":"I found myself taking my wife here for our anniversary dinner. Incredible ambience, we found our self spending the whole night here til 4 am weekend closing time sharing a 12 piece tenders meal. Go with half spicy half mild, it's culinary masterwork. I have come here ritually for our anniversary since, and remember always Popeyes is the lords work."}
{"text":"Zero stars for service, they are super rude and they probably don't wash their hands very well."}
{"text":"This place absolutely sucks . ordered two of there specials and they said its a 10 minute wait . now how in the hell is a place that solely sells chicken not have chicken ready seriously !!! Every time I come here its the same thing never have chicken ready u go thru drive thru and they make u park and wait for ur order . seriously people stay away from this place . worthless"}
{"text":"Popeyes always got the best fried chicken ever! I would have given a five star if the staff could be less angry? The lady who was loading my food was yelling at me across the counter to ask what my order was just because she was mad at the cashier who did not want to tell her what I've ordered? Bazaar place, and wait time is super long, cuz only one cashier is working, who is also mad and slow...can't believe this place...not coming back again"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to eat dinner here before our flight back home. I haven't had Popeyes in a while. I wanted to try to shrimp meal because I always saw it on the commercials. The shrimp meal was really good. It's fried goodness. It comes with a side so I got fries. The fries are seasoned fries, which I prefer! I ordered an extra biscuit since I know my wife would eat all of mine if I didn't. The biscuits are really tasty. It has a buttery taste to it that makes it melt in your mouth. 

This place is pretty good to help with any alcohol hangovers that you may have when leaving Vegas. I'd definitely come back here and grab a bite to eat if I'm waiting for a flight out. The service was good and the food came out pretty quick. Good meal to satisfy my hunger until I get home."}
{"text":"Ok , so of course the food itself is 5 stars . I mean come on the employees are not making the flavor they are just preparing what's already made.  So,worth that being said this review is on the employees.  I must say i will not be returning to this location. The employees are DEFINITELY NOT very warm & welcoming.  Honestly , none of them seemed to even care to be working there at all. They were very much interested with joking with each other and answering thier cell phones. The kitchen area looked so messy and the restrooms were dirty. No it was not busy at all . I guess i came from the generation where whatever job tpu had you fid it 100% .. i just cant see myself spending my hard earned money in a place where i cant even get a welcome or have a good day.... smh"}
{"text":"Went to this place for the \"Tuesday special\" that Popeyes advertises. And this place said they don't do the Tuesday specials. So they had a new special for $4 wicked good deal and they said they didn't have the chicken for that special. So.... I ordered a #2 with Cajun rice. When I got my order, the side rice was only filled halfway. ?!!  They also were out of napkins. I'm surprised this place even has chicken at this point. The guy that took my order was ok but everything else in this visit was unacceptable. This is why I'm never coming to this location ever again. This kind of stuff makes a bad name for the Popeyes franchises."}
{"text":"The food is good but it took me 25 minutes waiting in the parking lot for FRIES. I went through the drive through and was told to pull around... 25 minutes later I walked inside a little upset and my bag was sitting on the counter. The lady says \"it just came up.\". My food wasn't hot..... Not a good experience. I might go inside next time."}
{"text":"First attempt eating here. What can I say but wow. The staff couldn't be more inept. Waited over 30 minutes for chicken. No really. A chicken restaurant that is out of chicken. First they said it would be 10 minutes but that was obviously not true. While waiting, the staff was bickering about who was going to to what chores. All around a bad experience. The reason for the 3 stars is the food was good. This place has potential but would need someone to clean house. Hopeful"}
{"text":"Decided to do drive thru on a Sunday night. When I get to the window right away trouble started with them not knowing what I ordered? Umm seriously there was only one other car in front and you forgot my order? So after reiterating what I wanted the kid said they where waiting on the bone I. Chicken to cook and it should be a minute and to pull up. I waited and realized that 2 other customers have gotten food by now and I'm still waiting?!  It's sucks when you go through a drive thru but have to get out to get your order. Inside all the employees seemed lost as the manager had to deal with the delay of chicken orders. Long store short 20mins after I order I get my chicken get home and realize they messed up the sides! Really. How freaking annoying! Welp will not be coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"Worst one yet!!! The toaster for the P.O. boy was broke. I got little chicken nuggets instead of chicken strips. Waited forever. The cashier was coughing and said to us that she feels sick! I will never go here again!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to many Popeyes restaurant around the GTA, but this location is different but in a good way. First of all, the location is great and very convenient for me to go too since I'm a student. The prices are average, except for the days Popeyes usually have those daily deals so i guess that a good thing. The service is average for a fast-food resturant so no complaints there. The place is very clean and no mess what so ever.The food is better tasting than in other Popeyes restaurant in the GTA, it's less greasy so that means you actually can taste the chicken which in my opinion is a very good thing! One thing that bothers me about this particular location is that since this restaurant is located conveniently in the Downtown core of Toronto, there's a lot of homeless people coming into the restaurant and harassing you to give them your change (money). Usually when this happens the employees in the restaurant respectfully escorts them out. Other than that, taking the food for take-out is a better option."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed because when they finally added Cajun rice on the menu, which by the way is a regular side item from where I come from. But anyway it's not cajun it's bland, and white I give them a big five thumbs down. And their biscuits sometimes are hard. They spicy can be a little bit more spicy too. Long time Popeye chicken fan that's all.....sorry!!!#"}
{"text":"Ok so I just left the restaurant. They were getting ready to close for the night, the 2 young gentleman who help me were amazing, they didn't have everything to complete my order but we're more than helpful and apologetic, I've been to a different Popeyes restaurant and had the complete opposite experience. It was bad enough that I will drive 15 Miles out of my way to this other one every time..."}
{"text":"It took forever to get my order and they still got it wrong! Won't be coming back to this branch"}
{"text":"Goddamn, i knew i made a mistake when i walked through the doors

I'd never been to a popeyes before and I was starving and needed something quick on the way. 

I ordered the chicken po-boy with red rice and beans and the cashier tried to explain something to me but I couldnt understand a word she was saying and she was also taking orders from the drive thru over her headset so I just walked away after i got my receipt.

14 minutes later i finally got my food in a to-go bag even tho i said i was eating in. 

The chicken strips on the po-boy were 90% deep-fried breading and 10% the fake ass chicken i was expecting. There was also two pickles and about 7 strands of diced lettuce and a slathering of mayo. 

I.Still.Ate.It.All. Did i mention that i was starving? Still.. I'll never return."}
{"text":"Well, the food is delicious. Not exactly what I  ordered but close enough. 

So, I can't tell ya how the Cajun rice is but the beans and rice are quite good. 

The biscuits could be baked a little longer.

But I gotta say this crew was giving it their all. 

These kids cared damn it. They moved with a purpose! Maybe there is hope for this generation?? Maybe? 

I worked at Popeyes in high school for approximately 2 days-Bless their young, hard working hearts! 

And God Bless Popeyes!"}
{"text":"1st time at Popeye's. 
Staff were nice but mislead us regarding spiciness of shrimp. My son couldn't eat them - medium spicy. Also, they were super tiny, very unlike the menu photo. Chicken strips were ok but Canes is WAY better. Mash potatoes were also spicy and not good. The food is taco bell quality. Never again."}
{"text":"Been in the drive through for 20 min with just 2 cars in front of me. Didn't even want what I ordered anymore. Just drove past the window"}
{"text":"Never go there after 10pm...
They shut down the fryer an hour before closing so if you do manage to get food just know that it's been sitting there since around 9:45pm.
I asked an employee why they were always out of food and her response was \"cuz we fidd'n da close in 30\"
Not a good reason and definitely not a professional way to explain it.
If I could give less stars I would based on there awful customer service.
Foods not bad (if there not out)!"}
{"text":"Actually it is -5 stars.  Still in drive thru line after 27 mins!!  Very slow service and horrible design of the drive thru lane.  Cross traffic trying get by and people walking everywhere.  Nice employees but they are slow as hell.  Too busy to get decent service.  Please hire more people for your peak hours."}
{"text":"This is the worst Popeyes. Every time I come to Popeyes they are out of something or maybe they are just lazy and don't want to make the food, I don't know. Last time I was here I ordered a large fry and to my surprise they weren't in my bag when I got home. I called to see if I could get my money back and no one answered. I called 4 different times and it looks like no one answers the phone. I just let it go, I wasn't going to drive all the way back, I just won't be going back. They need to start ordering what they need. They are always out of spicy chicken and apple pies."}
{"text":"Most of the time, our expectations were met.  I am a convert from that other chicken place with 3 initials.  OK people it is a fast food place, not a fancy restaurant.  Sometimes things are fast, sometimes a bit slow.  We have been lucky and usually have good experience.  Over the 3 chicken places, Popeyes seems to offer the best deal and their menu is the same and doesn't change all the time like the other big one."}
{"text":"Most Popeye's are pretty good. Sometimes you run into a bad one. I just moved into the hood. My old one in Texas was absolutely horrible. I noticed the drive through line was really long and thought... must be a good one! Went in to avoid the long drive through. One cashier. Ten minutes in line to place order. I was good with that. But then it happened. The wait. As I watched all these people (many!) who ordered after me leaving with their food, I asked if they lost my order. We are going to need another 6-7 minutes. We are going to need another 6-7 minutes. We are going to need another 6-7 minutes. I finally demanded my money back. Manager was very polite. She asked me what she could do to make it right. I said just get me my food! 6-7 minutes later... I had food. My family meal and extras was bumped up with an apple pie. Oh boy! Get home, buscuits are missing.

So the food was on par with what I expect from a fast food Popeyes, but there was nothing fast about it. Foods on par, but there processes are broken."}
{"text":"This is the worst Popeyes in all of Las Vegas! The service is horrible! 
Today was the 4th time I've tried this location, 99% of the time they are out of food. Especially the Special! 
I finally decided to complain to a manager. This guy Travis tells me, if you don't like it, go to McDonalds across the street! Really? Then I get aggravated and he tells me he's no longer going to listen to me and walks away. As I'm driving off he says, \"Good Riddance.\" Really? I have every right to complain when everyone I know has had several issues at this location. 
I don't complain much, as my reviews will . Travis needs to be fired! He is the worst manager ever! 
I'll drive to Decatur, before ever going to this location ever again! Good Riddance!"}
{"text":"This place is FILTHY. They serve old, cold food. Run by total morons. A disgrace to Al Copeland's vision of fast food genius. The best thing that could happen to this place is a grease fire!"}
{"text":"Usually the customer service is bad, but the last time I went the girl at drive thru was very nice. I always check my order before I leave, usually something is missing, but I LOVE the food!"}
{"text":"Tuesday special is no joke!  I love it too! One of the best deals in town for fried chicken... be ready to wait though. ..."}
{"text":"The workers here were extremely rude and service is extremely slow. 

When I first placed my order there was only one couple ahead of me. After waiting 30 mins, I went up to ask how much longer it was going to take for the food to be ready and the worker basically yelled at me that there was no more chicken and that I had to wait. I saw this happen to another customer that asked the same question. Eventually the worker yelled that \"I can't rush the chicken, do you want this shit raw\". 

Would not recommend."}
{"text":"My goodness where do I start?!? No cajun rice, no spicy chicken (had to wait 10mins - which is fine - it's fresh), no coleslaw. I opted for jambalaya. When I came home, the rice was not fully cooked and it was room temperature. WTF kind of mickey mouse operation are you guys running?"}
{"text":"We won't be back! The chicken tenders have been raw last two orders! And,  every time we've been, our order has been missing something! The staff are very rude! Don't even ask for the condiments you've paid for! They swear they're in the bag! Horrible rude service!!! Steer clear of this Popeye's! They are the worst!! Don't even deserve one star!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service was lousy. Our first visit was close to the grand opening, we were greeted, music playing. This time we weren't greeted, they were out of supplies, no one smiled, and despite the language barrier the eye rolls and lack of customer service were bad."}
{"text":"I have loved Popeyes since I was in the army and there was one on my post. I had been craving Popeyes for months and was so excited to be in the neighborhood for this one! So I showed up and they looked behind. No issue, I've worked in fast food and I am very patient. I waited 30 minutes for my meal (I was looking on their bumb screen). After 30 minutes the girl asked if I would be ok with mild chicken instead of spicy. Did I just wait 30 minutes to not even get the right food??? You would think in 30 minutes they could have at least made the right food. And then the wrong order was stale and cold. So not sure I would come back to Popeyes anymore. So sad."}
{"text":"My wife ordered a po-boy and jambalaya for me and chicken for herself with a side of red-beans and rice. Clerk said no jambalaya yet so she took green-beans and gravy.  Green beans were out of a can, not fresh and gravy, ugh.  Po-boy shrimp overcooked.  Her side of red-beans and rice were missing when she got home.  I was warned and now know better."}
{"text":"I love Popeyes but this one is the worst I have ever been to. The service was terrible and the chicken was hard and cold like it was 2 days old. They do not even answer the phone."}
{"text":"The food at most Popeyes tastes the same, it's pretty good. This place is the same. The reason for the 5 stars is that this place had 4 people working during a really slow time (Saturday night) more over and the important part is they have a basket with ketchup unlike other stores that give you 3 tiny packs with a lot of fries, makes no sense. The soft drink dispenser was also put in the open for refills, another first at Popeyes."}
{"text":"Worst Popeyes. They always take forever, have the worst customer service, and the food is always cold. The last time I left before ordering and will never return. They had a huge line with NO one taking orders and then the manager strolls up from a break and sees the line then proceeds to check herself in the mirror and spray herself with the most aweful perfume which made the whole place smell, then takes another 5 minutes to clock in and put her purse down and still didn't start taling orders. I left once I realized she didn't give a shit plus her perfume made me lose my appetite."}
{"text":"Good food. Quick drive thru. Never disappoints. The biscuits are way better than KFC. Their shrimp baskets are great too."}
{"text":"I work at a Farmers Insurance Office near by. I love this place. Guess you can say, \"Love That Chicken From Popeyes!\" I'm here at least 3 times a week! 
One of my favorite things about Popeyes, is that the Menu is always changing! I love the traditional Menu Items. However, I like that they always have new seasonal items.
I've visited many Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen locations. It's one of my favorite Fast Food Chains to visit. This location is constantly consistent in theFood Quality! The service is always 100% perfect. The employees work very hard, always friendly, and always efficient.
I wish I could eat here 3 times a day, every day. I would definitely recommend this Popeyes location to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Just tried to eat at this Popeyes. Ordered, paid and waited and waited and waited. There were many employees but none that seemed to actually be doing anything productive. Finally had to ask for our money back after a long wait and no order filled. This is the second time I have gone to this location and it will be my last.  Too bad because I really like the product when it is made right. I think we will go to canes on the way home."}
{"text":"Ordered the eight piece spicy chicken meal with cole slaw and biscuits. We also ordered a large side of French fries to go with our meal. The French fries were to die for!! Hot and crispy!!! 
The place was hectic for it was really busy. Our meal came out correct and it everything tasted fresh. 
One thing that did bug me was that if you want any dipping sauces they will charge you 30 cents. So next time al just bring my own ranch from home. The least they can do is give you one for free."}
{"text":"It says on the sign on the front door as well as on google that the drive thru closes at 11 pm. We went at 10:43 pm and they said they were closed, this is such false advertisement."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever witnessed. Absolutely horrible. The attitude and the lack of attention is unbelievable. Really slow service as well, due to the lack of attention and organization by the manager and staff."}
{"text":"Went in today for lunch. Took a solid 4 minutes for the people who were three feet away having a conversation to acknowledge me. Food took forever and it was not busy. When the order finally came it was wrong. So disappointing because I was saving this for one of my cheat meals! :-("}
{"text":"- popeyes is better than kfc for 3 reasons
1) biscuits
2) crispier chicken
3) the fact that they deliver."}
{"text":"Not too great. You can taste the oil and it seems kind of old. The service is alright

Nothing too great about this place."}
{"text":"If i could give 0 stars for my experience tonight I would. My husband ordered 30 dollars worth of food, got home and we realized that the chicken they gave us was old, the biscuits were burnt and even the deserts were wrong. I ended up having to go all the way back there and i explained to them the issue and the \"manager\" had the audacity to not only argue with me but tell me i was wrong! First of all, since when did that become okay to argue with a customer, especially given the fact that i took my own time to come back down there just to get the order I paid for and not their old left overs! Second, i was on the phone with my husband as he ordered and got up to the window and heard this man give him the order back wrong and my husband had to correct him twice. I'm just in awe by this experience and by the fact that this \"manager\" treated me the way he did and talked to me with so much disrespect. Ironically, i worked at this exact popeyes years ago and i would have NEVER treated a customer the way he treated me."}
{"text":"Food in the trash... money in the trash. 2 stars, now I see why. Can't finish my meal. Went in at almost 5 pm. Ordered two spicy breast combo. Then, after order, before paying was told 15 minutes for chicken. WHAT??? It is DINNER time!  People are off work and don't want to cook. So, My only other choice are strips. These are 80% breading and the remainder chicken. I still feel that you know \"weird greasy\" sensation in my mouth. Also, Absolutely no flavor and they were apparently spicy.
The two pics show the amount of breading. One pic is a huge piece with no chicken. Breading seemed undercooked. Green beans were cold and the fat in them had hardened, no flavor, sickening.

This location is not going to make it if the general manager doesn't get in here and do something.
The service was great. A new kid, could tell he was nervous. After i ordered one of the managers told him what he did wrong. Newsflash, leave the kid alone and check the quality of your food!! Do YOUR job because he definitely did his.
Do you want good chicken? Visit Safeway until these people decide to get it together.
$17 for 2 small combos of absolutely disgusting food.
Forced to call corporate tomorrow."}
{"text":"We love Popeyes chicken and with this being the only one close to us we frequent it a lot. Today though we have decided we will no longer come to this location. First there is always a 5 to 10 minute wait for chicken and secondly what you get the chicken it is dry and overcooked. The people they're always seem to not understand that when we bring chicken back in it it's for a reason. When you pay good money you won't get service and good food and unfortunately this particular Popeyes has no idea how to do so."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, took forever, food was gross (I've had good Popeyes at other locations), and I didn't even get what I ordered. This place is INFAMOUSLY bad. These people are heartbreakingly apathetic."}
{"text":"We came in about 8:15pm - BIG MISTAKE . We must have gotten the chicken that was on display since the morning . They must have double dipped fried it to make it look fresh - DRY DRY DRY AND OILY !!   The woman cashier taking the order had the WORST ATTITUDE , first she took the order wrong , after correcting her and getting our food IT WAS STILL incorrect . When I pointed it out she blatantly said under her breath \"I DONT HAVE TIME FOR THIS \".  !!!!!  Well neither did I , asked for the manager and a refund ! 
WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IVE EVER experienced ."}
{"text":"This location is 5 star.  Chicken always good and fresh, order always right, punch is always on point.  Approve! They are always friendly."}
{"text":"Yo, every time the order in the drive through gets messed up.  This last time right at lunch time, we are out of legs, and the breast I got was so fuckin dryyyy!!!! Biscuits are good but they forgot one that we were charged for.  Gotta step the game up here."}
{"text":"You would like to think when you go into a large chain like Popeyes you would see consistency in flavor and portions. This store has it all wrong. I order a three-piece chicken meal with mashed potatoes and a biscuit. All I can say is I was fortunate enough not to get this order to go. What was put on the counter was two of the smallest wingettes which were smaller than any order of hot wings I have ever seen and a little itty bitty leg that wouldn't pass the mustard at Buffalo Wild Wings which I passed up to go here. 1st bad move. I looked up with amazement at the server and said this is not going to work. I need a breast and another piece of chicken the correct size. The server then put another leg in smaller than the first so I said no I want a breast and a normal sized piece. The only piece of normal size was the breast and it was very good. So I sucked it up and sat down to find my potatoes three-quarters full with a hint of gravy. Yes, we are on a roll now and it was a very fine roll. If corporate has decided to save a little money by purchasing lower weighted chickens or if they are trying to save the American people from becoming overweight then please say so. I will get my grub on elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fantastic service. Asked for a freshly made chicken sandwich and was not disappointed.
Mashed potatoes was delicious and the fries were fresh.
My go-to popeyes."}
{"text":"This location has slow service. I noticed a worker was prepping about 5 orders BEFORE calling out the numbers. Instead she should've called out EACH order as they were completed. Long unnecessary waiting. NOT GOING THERE AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Love this chicken!  Tried their new Surf and Turf and found the shrimp to be smaller than they look on TV and too much breading.  But, did I say I love this chicken?  However, the counter staff could use some refresher courses on customer service."}
{"text":"Bomb chicken every visit . lmao if you're looking for healthy choices better stick to chick fil gay"}
{"text":"I just stopped by the drive thru and as common they dont get the order right. I ended up getting a combo when I didnt order one, when I asked for the receipt they told me their machine didn't printed the receipts. I wanted the receipt to confirm what they were charging me. I asked a second time for my receipt and they told me to pull upfront and that they will print out a receipt. The lady came out with the receipt and with $1 because she got the order wrong. I just feel sorry for the bad service, something that happens in many places."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 Thursday special( 6 Bonafide chicken) + 2 fries + Cole Slaw + 2 Bonafide chicken and biscuits for free ( my coupon). They didn't accept my coupon and told me to use at the restaurant that I got it (although it was clearly stated on the coupon that I could use it at any restaurants.) Fine!. I asked them to give me lots of ketchup but they just give me 3 or 4 packets. When I got home, I couldn't find my fries---They forgot it !!! And they even gave me the old chicken-- The meat was so bad.

Although I really like Popeyes, I won't eat at this Downtown restaurant anymore"}
{"text":"Big girl at drive thru gave bad customer service! Food took long to get, she probably ate all the chicken! Lol"}
{"text":"Popeyes is a sister location of churches chicken...  so they taste pretty much the same. But it's really good!!!"}
{"text":"I've never been impressed with this place.  I go there rarely because they are so bad.  The only thing I would ever get from this store was the wrap (which they no longer offer).  It's hard to mess that up.  I only went to this store tonight because the taco bell drive thru was long.  I should have waited.  What a waste of money.  The food wasn't good, the sweet tea wasn't good, and the lady in the drive thru didn't put any sauces, honey, or forks in my bag for my chicken tenders and red beans and rice.  The only good thing about this trip was the red beans and rice.  The chicken and tea was bad and I didn't eat the biscuit without any honey so that was wasted."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to eat at this location because it is really close to my work. I had an overall great experience, the workers were nice, the atmosphere was clean and most importantly the food was good. I will definitely eat here again in the near future."}
{"text":"This location used to be the better one to go.  Of lately I cannot day it is.  I went in there on 9/26/17 at 7:00pm.  First the employee didn't great with a smile or even a warm welcome.  Ordered the 12 piece meal spicy and 8 piece meal mild to go.  After a 15 Min. wait, get home missing one of my sides and the spicy wasn't spicy.  Tried calling 3 times, never answered the phone.  So done with this location, always mess up your order."}
{"text":"Its a Popeyes at the LV airport. So I'm not expecting fresh fast food. Service was friendly. Eating area was relatively clean. Fries were ok, but had that \"under the heating lamp\" taste. Still, it was a nice $3 snack."}
{"text":"I saw on tv the new spicey wings. I have been very dissatisfied with this Popeyes in the past because of incorrect foods or not getting the food I ordered at all. Oh yeah, the food is always cold. I even sit in my car and eat to make sure its hot and its not. Since it is football playoff Sunday, I decided to try the wings. Ive heard of their popcorn shrimp, but popcorn chicken wings?  Tiny little wings. From what bird are we getting these wings from? Not chicken. If they are, why are they so small. Never saw wings this tiny before. Maybe you guys should look into the Quality over Quantity aspect. I know the public would want that. I know I would rather have less tiny crap wings and a few less bigger wings that taste good. 
My advice, spend alittle more and go to a bar. You definitely will be happier.
So disappointed again. Why do I fall for these fake tv commercials? Never again."}
{"text":"Popeye's has improved a ton since they first opened. The chicken has the signature flavor now, and you can taste it with or without the dipping sauces. The drive-through is a sticking point. When they get busy, they miss sides sometimes. Still, I have no problem recommending this location."}
{"text":"***Drive-Thru Review Only***

Perhaps I just caught them on a good day....but I was very pleased with my visit to this Popeye's! 

I arrived a little before noon and the lunch rush hadn't started. I ordered the three chicken tenders (spicy) with fries and a drink. And of course included the the buffalo sauce for dipping! 

They asked for my name after I ordered which I didn't expect but thought it was a nice touch! When I pulled up to the the window she said my name took my card and thanked me for coming in! I was through in less than 5 minutes! 

And the best part of all....everything was HOT. The chicken, fries and biscuit. I really enjoyed every bite! 

But maybe I'm a bit bias because I've been a long time fan of Poppeye's but I'm definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I am giving a two star because I love Popeyes food.After several disappointing visit to this Popeyes it's time for me to yelp for help. I'm from Louisiana where it seems like there's a Popeyes on every corner. Since it's very popular in the south it's always chaotic in a Popeyes but your food is hot delicious and your order is normally right.Last night my wife and I paid for our meal sat down for eight minutesWaiting for a meal. That's when the young man approached me and asked me if I would come back up to the counter and re-pay for my meal because their computer and did not take it he said. My first thought was why did it take eight minutes to figure it out. My second thought was why did a manager not come and do this instead of delegating it to the youngest person there.On My way up to the counter I checked my account and seen that I had been charged. I went to the counter embarrassed and somewhat upset but my composure was good considering. I showed the lady on my checking account that they hadthe amount pending from my bank. The manager said well would you please tell us what you ordered because we have no idea. Earlier today my wife called customer service and explain what happened. Reaction was somewhat normal let me check with the manager see what happen and I'll get back with you. When the regional manager called my wife back she never apologize. It's Very obvious that the problem is systemic. It starts at the top. The regional manager when my wife told her that although we love Popeyes and are from Louisiana we was considering not going back to that store her response was \"OK\". WhenThis is the type of people that is in upper management of course the store is going to have problems. A managers job is to defuse the situation. That regional manager could have told my wife I'm so sorry you had a problem ma'am I will be sure that never happens again don't quit coming to see us OK. This lady has no people skills. You can't teach managers people skills when the regional manager has no people skills. I refused to quit going to Popeyes. Would somebody please fix this mess. Oh by the way while I was having all those problems another man with returning an eight piece dinner that was wrong after he had driven all the way back to his house and come back with a meal that was totally wrong. If the regionals don't care managers and staff certainly won't. After having my wife speak with regional management we do not blame the manager for our visit. Clearly the regional should be an assistant manager and learn how to be a people person like they should have learned before they were promoted."}
{"text":"Lady in the drive thru gave me one sauce for a 5 piece tender meal. The food was not that good either."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is a loser on yelp, especially the drive-through.  I was visiting my mom in North Vegas when she said she wanted Popeye's. So I said a short prayer...oh God, get me in and out fast...and it worked! I walked in and out with no drama and little loss of time on a Sunday at 12:15 PM.  

I love their spicy fried chicken, tastewise and texture wise, too.  Very crisp on the outside with a slight amount of heat, just salty enough, and after the crunch... you get moist and tender meat on the inside. it's not health food but is sure is good once in a while. 

The nice very young female cashier behind the counter was smiling the whole time, and even made sure I got the two wings for the mixed 5 piece with two sides pack for $10.  And the chicken was not just good, but still hot when I got to my mom's house in 15 minutes. 

The tables inside were clean, and there were two parties that looked like they were having a good time.  I noticed 2 cars pulling into the drive- thru as I walked in, and they were gone by the time I walked out. Apparently, no long waits that day.  So the stars were properly aligned for the Popeye's customers...maybe it was because everyone went to church...it is Lent on the Catholic calendar!  Haha, there is hope yet.  It's a shame others didn't have as great of visit as I did.  

My main complaint was that the sides are just too small.  The green beans were excellent, but I'd want more beans and less water next time.  The coleslaw is not my favorite, too much mayo.  I should've ordered their rice which I like, but am trying to cut down on carbs  The chicken pieces were normal size except for the tiny chicken leg.  That bird must've been picked on by the other chickens...\"Hey dude, you sure got small legs\"... and easily caught by the chicken catchers.   

Here's hoping they get their act together.  Their product is just too good to let their lousy customer service skills kill their business."}
{"text":"Only get the chicken when it's super fresh. Opt for the spicy rather than the regular. It's not very spicy. Just a mild kick. 
Biscuits are heavenly. Again. Has to be fresh though. 

Pass on the onion rings. Not good. 

Clean location."}
{"text":"They updated their chicken tenders pricing, so now it really is cheaper to order more. Also added five new dipping sauce flavors."}
{"text":"I am oh so happy the fried crawfish are back , if you order them as a side for 6 dollars , you can get your fill. Other wise unless you go when the Tuesday special is on, the chicken, while very good , is a little pricey."}
{"text":"I love Popeye's chicken, period. I love the extra spicy, and I make it my dinner on Tuesday nights , when you can get a leg and a thigh for  99 cents. I wish this one was closer to me, the one on Greenway is the one I usually get stuck with, the place is filthy, and the staff is new , under trained and understaffed. But you know the chicken is always good here, and the store is clean."}
{"text":"The location is great and the food is awesome. There is nothing better than fried chicken at a gas station, the tea is amazing and the service was great. $5 meal box is the way to go."}
{"text":"This Popeyes is horrible. Everytime I go it's something. Keep trying to give it a chance but this is it. Imma have to start driving further when I want Popeyes because this location should be shut down. Everytime I go though?!"}
{"text":"The place is pretty clean.  The server was really fast, but I found it kind of rude.  The deep chicken breast in the crunchy batter with the spice was amazing though.  And the price was reasonable.  Not bad since it is close to where I like to hang out."}
{"text":"I love popeyes chicken but I am giving it a 3 coz every time I enter here a weird smell I gt and of course please clean the bathroom. ."}
{"text":"Pretty good, no issues. Food was hot and tasty. Freindly staff (a little hard to understand, but whatever). All in all, satisfied."}
{"text":"I would normally give 5 stars to this location but today was different. Since its lent I decided on fish from here for dinner (bad idea). I ordered with no issue at all although it sounded like the girl was nervous (later found out why). When I got up to the window you could see either the owner or someone high up on the food chain was watching everyone closely. There was a lot of tension in the air and nervousness from everyone due to this gentleman. Normally when we go everyone is amazing and calm and look like they're enjoying their job....not today!! Also the seafood portions are really small and don't taste very good. Just gonna stick to chicken from now on."}
{"text":"No red beans and rice at Popeyes? So disappointing!  Went through the drive through and specifically went to Popeyes (over Church's Chicken) just for the red beans and rice. I placed my order and wanted to add 2 apple pies. I was told that it would be a 7 minute wait. Passed on the pies. Get it together Popeyes!!!"}
{"text":"Typically don't review chains as most of them are mediocre at best.  I've tried this place a few times since they've opened up shop and they have the rudest people working here every time I've went.  They are rude from the manager on down.

It's hard to expect much out of fast food but to consistently be this rude is a game changer.  I'm not sure what they are so mad about.  The food can't be difficult to make.  It tastes like it was slapped together and made well before I ordered.  

Is it that hard to say hi, smile, take an order, hand out change, and say thank you?  

After looking at the other reviews I know I'm not alone here.  This area could use some good options and I look forward to the day this place closes and opens up as something else.  The rent is not cheap here and not surprisingly the place is always dead.

I will never come back."}
{"text":"Of course, I had Popeye's before, but if you look at the online menu there is nothing similar to the actual restaurant menu at this location. So, I was looking for naked tenders, but they were not around on the menu. Ended up with a few loaded chicken wraps at $1.69 each, but they are far from loaded. They are wrapped in a chipotle tortilla I think and it involves one breaded tender with some rice and beans. Loaded? I think not. Also added a biscuit, but no butter or honey was given in the bag. I thought that was automatic. Probably should stick to the regular chicken next time (next time I'm in the South) since that is what they are known for a long time, but the chain food tastes better when you eat it in the southern United States."}
{"text":"This new location is the worst ever...the workers here have no customer service skills what so ever, and they are also very ghetto. You would think they would upgrade after building this new store but it looks like all they did was keep the same rude people that they had when they were across the street at Terribles gas station"}
{"text":"Real Dissatisfaction today ... I asked 4 fresh chix .. stripping chix.. said I would wait .. they gave my order right away ... the cook came from the back .. heavy set lady .. I asked if just came up she said yes ... she know she wouldn't eat what she gave me ... u don't deserve no stars today ... BIG TIP!!! Overweight light skinned woman in the back with apron .. Go get food somewhere else ...she lazy an don't care wasn't worth 9$ ... mayb she ate my fresh chix"}

{"text":"Don't even want to give them that.  Dropped my food on the floor and tried to give it to me anyway.  Gave me the wrong order twice, and still wound up getting it wrong in the end.  Worst place and service I have ever been to and had"}
{"text":"I really like the chicken and biscuits. But it seems to be a trend in this chain to not clean tables in the lobby. I am sitting here looking at am two employee clearly o break but ever table is dirty."}
{"text":"Every Tuesday I've been here, they have those signs looking like they were just made off the printer that say \"No Tuesday Specials.\" What's going on Popeyes on Stephanie?! How can you NOT have Tuesday specials?! What a waste of gas. The location on boulder highway is my go to place on Tuesdays. They actually follow Popeyes weekly tradition."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about 6 months and always get the same thing: 6 mild drumsticks, a la carte. Half the time they try charging me $12 for the order, but then I explain there's an off-menu deal for 99 cents a piece, total $6.43. If the order taker doesn't seem to know about it, the manager always does and rings it up for me. I always get it, but tonight they tried to tell me that deal didn't exist, and when I asked for the manager, they said the same thing, so I left. It's very frustrating that they can't be consistent and I don't even know why this deal isn't on the menu. I don't want the extras, just chicken. Anyway I won't be back. I do have to say there's ONE guy there that has helped me several times and always had a great smile (he joked about how I ordered \"a la carte\"). Rest of the staff is mediocre at best. I've also had the issue with missing food in my order and and sullen, resentful attitudes when going back to get the order corrected."}
{"text":"The food was great. But the service was bad. We had to wait 30 min for our food. And when we got it, Guadalupe behind the counter wanted to charge 25 cents per sauce packet. After telling her we waited a long time for our food and we shouldn't have to pay for condiments, the manager told her just give it to them. This place was really slow and filled with waiting customers.  A 30 min wait for an 8 piece meal is not cool."}
{"text":"This is the worst fast food restaurant for customer service. They are always rude and NEVER get your order right. I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"1-12-2017 the manager (Edward) was awesome. They were getting ready to close & he stayed open for me and let me order with a smile. Get that guy a RAISE. As a business owner myself I'd be happy to have him running my team. Thanks Edward,
Sincerely Scott"}
{"text":"Zero  stars  this location  is fairly  new, however  in the 4 times I've been  there is always  a problem. Last time the chicken was undercooked. I wasn't aware there's a medium temperature for chicken. This time  my order was wrong, I  got charged for food I never got,  then when I  brought  my order back to the store after going  all the way home the manager had an attitude, little  smart mouthed bitch. Worst location in Phoenix, worst service, worst staff, horrible management. I'd rather eat out of a vending machine then ever eat here again."}
{"text":"For a fast food joint, this is stellar! The food is great, the prices are great and the service has always been Great!!!

I reccomend the spicy fried chicken, mashed potatoes and a biscuit with honey on it. YUMMMMM!!!!

I have traveled the world and found this place in New Orleans Louisiana about 20 years ago. I loved it every since! Thank goodness they brought it to Arizona!

My 8 year old wanted me to take a picture of the sink in the bathroom and post a bad review on it because it has those knobs you have to hold down in order to get the water to come out, lol...I said NO, I love this place and we won't do that to them!

To the Owner: Don't change a thing, except your faucet in the bathroom sink!"}
{"text":"A restaurant (Popeyes) agreed to give refund but has not. Still have Just Eat charge. 

Food was running 30 minutes late. Called resto, they said 5 more minutes.

30 minutes later, food still later.

Finally delivered, I was about to open bag in front of delivery boy to check food. He rushed me before I could, and told me it had everything inside of it. I believed him.

Went back to my apartment, opened bag. Wrong order. Not enough food.

At this point had to leave to catch a flight.

I call the resto and their manager. He at first argues with me and says I am wrong.  Says he wil, get back to me. Makes me wait half an hour. Finally I call back. He says that yeah, order is wrong, and he had given us the wrong order.

He agrees to refund me the money.

Believe him. Check a few days later, charge is still in place. He lies yet again. 

Worst experience on Just Eat that I have ever had. Do not order from here. They are unprepared and WILL get your order wrong and be late. There are tons of other restaurants, and other popeyes to get delivery from."}
{"text":"Prices are a bit high but, the food was decent. We received our drive thru order quickly and the cashier was friendly."}
{"text":"I had a really good experience yesterday. Regina and her c o workers were awesome from the time I came in to the time I left (I dined in). I'm from Chicago so I'm  immune to rude employees, but this great experience made me and my partners day.....Thanks guys #give them a raise pleaseeeee"}
{"text":"So I ordered my 3 wing meal and I'm really excited to try this chicken.  I get home (less than 5 mins away) and it's completely cold and dried out.  And I mean everything I ordered.  There is nothing worse than cold and dried out Chicken, Fries and Biscuits.  Come on how hard is it to make fresh food and know when it is not so fresh anymore.  I really wanted to like it too, so disappointing. 

Unacceptable Popeyes, I'm pretty sure your founder Alvin Copland would not be pleased with your store!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I were so excited to try this place. Never had Popeyes before but had seen the commercials and always hoped we'd have one in our area at some point. I feel bad saying it but we were disappointed and we really, really wanted to like it. We always support new businesses in the area and want them to be successful. Three stars for service alone. The food was not good. The chicken was dry and the batter though crispy seemed like it had set under a warmer for some time. The green beans were okay. The Mac and cheese totally reminded me of the canned mac we use to eat as kids (that's not a good thing). Mashed potatoes were palatable. Popcorn shrimp also just okay. Just lacking in the fresh dept. this location is new so we'll give it another shot. I really hope they read these reviews and make corrections before they bite the dust."}
{"text":"I used to come to this Popeyes very often because their chicken were very moist and juicy and the crust wasn't as oily as other Popeyes. Since they always had a long line up there, I decided to give them a call first to order the food so when I arrived I can just pick up the food right away. When I arrived, the staff didn't seem to know my order (I saw my order sheet was the first one on the order line), I told him that was my order. He then processed my payment and asked me everything again. I ordered a 5 pieces tender and a 3 pieces bonanfide with a biscuit. Then, I saw him put my order sheet at the back of the line, which meant I have to wait for my order again. (Originally, I was supposed to be the first one).I was very disappointed and strongly believe that there's no way you said  this chain claimed that they were doing customer pick up for phone order if they did not followed orders based on the time customer order. It was a waste of my time and they did not put the biscuit in my take out bag too. 

I won't go back given that there are way better chicken places than this Popeyes store."}
{"text":"They are so slow 
It is fast food place acting like slow food.
I ordered 3pcs combo n it make 15minites
When I order there wasn't line I would be go church's chicken.  Instead of here"}
{"text":"Came by on a Tuesday evening.

Pretty clean, nice place for a fast food joint. Not that much seating, but it wasn't too busy so it was ok.
First thing I notice are the daily specials, $3.29 for two pieces of fried chicken (leg and thigh)!! Dang what a steal!!
We ordered \"spicy\" but as expected, it wasn't spicy at all. Although it was pretty flavourful. And the breading is on point, pretty generous and very crunchy. The one thing I didn't like was how greasy the meat was. Especially the thigh, if anything choose drumsticks or chicken tenders over thigh meat.
Biscuits here are also delicious! Fluffy, buttery goodness for $0.95! A bit on the small side but they are filling.
And service was super fast, which I love. Food came to us literally right after we ordered.

Definitely beats KFC or even more trendy places like the dirty bird in Kensington."}
{"text":"There service is horrible and it just opened very sad they will give u very little of serving on sides"}
{"text":"I gave this place 5 stars because of their customer service, cleanliness of restaurant and food, which was very good.

However, whoever was MOD(manager on duty) on 8/27/2017 was extremely  unprofessional!! 

As I was waiting at the counter for my food, I saw a lady come storming into the store like a bat out of hell. I figured something horrible went wrong with her order or something, until she walked passed me and went behind the counter where the employees was working. As soon as she made it to the kitchen area, I can clearly see and hear her start to YELL OUTRAGEOUSLY at the employees,  telling them what the fuck they couldn't do with the phone system, yes she blatantly cussed at them. The employees didn't respond to her, but just continued working. Then she storms back out the store.

I applaud those poor employees, nobody deserves to be treated with such disrespect, ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Popeyes I've come to in the Markham/Scarbs area due to the high level of customer service that other Popeyes seem to lack. 
There's this one guy who seems to be the owner or manager, who is exceptionally friendly!! Always greets me and delivers excellent customer service. The other day, they even gave me free fries with my meal for the \"long wait.\""}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night after a quick workout for some protein. The restaurant was busy AF (Drive through and inside). Despite the overwhelming amount of guests the restaurant neat, presentable, and was in order. Lejhnae took my order and she was sweet, professional, and wore a smile for every guest who came in and had questions. I was quite impressed by her uplifting demeanor despite the obvious rush. The food came out in a quick and timely manner and was hot and delicious. Will definitely be returning. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Worst drive thru experience ever. Told me to pull up and wait in front of the door.m, ended up waiting 15 minutes until I decided to just go inside. They had no recollection of my order"}
{"text":"Popeye's polarizes people like no other chain. Some people find it a better option than the Colonel... while others find it greasy and gross. This location isn't terrible and it gets the job done. The chicken seems a bit more greasy than KFC which can be either a plus or a minus depending on who you ask. The Popcorn shrimp is also pretty decent. Don't get anything that takes awhile to prepare, your best bet is chicken that is already ready to go. Don't want to be waiting for 10 minues for them to dig some mac and cheese side out of the back."}
{"text":"The service has dropped. The chicken was horribly greasy and even though I told them 4 times that I wanted sides of sauces they never put them in . This has happened the last 5 times I've gone. I'm a parent who's always doing a million things at once and I do not have time for this . the last time I've gone they forgot the biscuits before that 2 sides. Today I went for their special not only did they forget the side and sauces but there was a hair in the chicken.  Never going there again. The only reason I've continued going there is because my husband likes the chicken but after today forget it . Do not go there. You will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I walked into this Popeyes last Friday the 11th at around 11:15 am and was able to get 3, 8 piece mixed orders with an online coupon.  I was expecting to have to wait for them to cook enough chicken for my order, but not the case.  I was in and out in less than 6 minutes! Not to mention the service and friendliness of the staff was excellent.  The chicken was off the charts and a huge hit at the office potluck.  Thank you Popeyes!"}
{"text":"I don't usually review Fast Food because it is what it is. 

But, this chicken is really bad. 

I got the Chicken Tender Meal. 

While the breading was tasty the chicken was tasteless. It really had no taste. Just sort of a firm fleshy feel but no taste. 

It would have been tastier if it was battered tofu. 

Don't waste the money or the calories on this place. 

It should go from the fryer straight to the trash. 

I haven't had Popeyes in years but I don't remember being this bad."}
{"text":"It was funny because the first time that I came here, the cashier was quite delightful. I felt like I stepped into Louisiana when he spoke, asking me if I wanted to add an apple pie to my order, in such a southern accent. Kinda funny. He was nice enough to let me know that there is a survey on the back of my receipt, and if I fill it out, I could get a 2 piece meal free next time. I don't really see anybody smiling behind the counter working fast food, but it was nice to see it.  Awesome.

The second time I came in, sadly, he was not working. But they were pretty fast and efficient and honored the coupon I got, even though I made it a little complicated.. So all in all, it was a good experience, just wish their chicken was a bit more spicy (when you order spicy, I feel like it's pretty mild), and spice could be evenly distributed better. A bit on the dry side as well. Someone please bring the nice gentleman back!"}
{"text":"The food is great and the employees are so nice & friendly but are slow. They always offer plenty of condiments with your food which is nice considering some fast food places are very stingy with their sauces. Always a good go to for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I love Popeyes food. At this particular location though, they always mess up my order. I go through the drive thru and mostly all the times I go, they have messed up my order. I usually order the chicken tenders and they will give me a chicken tender box, but with thighs and wings, or they will put fish fillet strips. It's a mess. It's inconvenient to be at the light going home, and have to do a u-turn at rush hour to go back & get what you've ordered."}
{"text":"Popeyes® Louisiana Kitchen we gave you so many chances to make it right and we've finally given up on you. You're customer service is so terrible. We even tried you at a completely different state and city. Ya'll still be messing up on orders every time. Tonight asked for popcorn shrimp and 3 piece tenders. Why the hell did I get calamari looking ass chicken? Ya'll even serve calamari because these got legs! No tartarsauce, no strawberry pies as ordered. You're food is good but your employees need training.  Pregnant lady here, not driving back for this."}
{"text":"I just hate these guys sometimes.
My order is never right.
My food is always cold.
Not one single smile.
How hard is it to just get a single order correct
Even when it isn't busy.
I'm over Popeyes, popeyes in Vegas that is.
Something about this town and its customer service.
But these guys will never amount to anything if they can't even take a little pride in their work. Keep to your minimum wage work...if my order isn't correct at least keep my food hot.

Thanks."}
{"text":"I can definetly say this chicken is better than KFC which IMO has gone way down in quality over the last several years.  I always get some form of the chicken strips.  Most recently I ordered some new Buffalo hot strips that are covered in buffalo hot sauce.  They were pretty good.  I wish the sauce was a bit spicier but I realize I am not the average person, I like really hot and spicy foods.  The sides are one of my favorite parts of Popeye's chicken.  I usually get the red beans and rice, but the mashed potatoes and gravy are very good as well. Price wise, I think they are hit and miss.  I usually only come here when they have some special that sounds good or is cheap.  They do seem to have a lot of additional options which look expensive to me.  BTW:  You can order your strips regular or with a spicy seasoning cooked into them."}
{"text":"The chicken was good or else I would of given this place a 1 star.  We ordered take out and it took 1/2 hour for our chicken to be ready and if we didn't step in they would of filled the other orders first.  I understand you can run low in chicken but at least acknowledge us that it is a longer than normal wait time. And when we asked why it was taking long we got sarcastic responses back and no compensation for the long wait. The good service reviews  from others must be friends or family members."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would! These idiots that work here are slow and seem too stupid to understand how to get people their orders. They take forever and a day. Never coming here again!"}
{"text":"How can you be out of all the sides at 8:30pm on a Monday, I had to drive to the location for on US 30. Bad business!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this establishment and my last. We went through the drive through and ordered an 8 piece chicken, we were told the wait would be 5 minutes which we were fine with so we parked in the parking lot and waited. We waited 20 minutes before walking in to get the food....only to walk in to the 2 employees talking shit about about us right in front of me, not realizing that I was just in the drive through. I asked for a refund and left. Horrible, will never visit this place again."}
{"text":"just like your typical popeyes. you know. sometimes the place gets really packed since getting some chicken here could be a game - (except on tuesdays where they have that special.) your order may come out quick, or comes out in about 30 minutes. place is pretty decent, although it is connected to a terribles. the only thing is that they cant clean some tables right away. napkins, crumbs, are everywhere. i love the \"popeyes radio\" too even though you can barely hear it. and id say kudos to the staff here for their patience when it comes to handling SOME ghetto customers complaining about their stuff. like come on people. these guys here, like Scott K. said in his review, need a break."}
{"text":"Anytime I go the people are nice to me, however the accuracy is pretty bad. I ordered a four piece meal with all legs and an Oreo pie. The guy at the widow was nice, handed me my order, and closer the window back up before he gave me my drink. When I got home I discovered the Oreo pie was missing and there was only one leg. Other times they have forgotten sides and spoons for the sides I do get. Food is good. But it's not good when things are missing."}
{"text":"People here need to listen properly. He got my order wrong multiple times and the place is really dirty. Not a good experience"}
{"text":"I was not expecting to get the best service at a popeyes from an airport. Most popeyes I've been to have miserable workers who can barely understand your order; however, the staff here was friendly and quick, and there were tons of seating in the area. The food quality is the same as any other popeyes, and I ordered the typical water + chicken + biscuit."}
{"text":"As I read the past reviews, I feel that I needed to post a positive review based on my very memorable experience.  First, I was greeted by the most cheerful and informative cashier.  That is why I would suggest that sometimes, you need to get out of your car and go inside, the experience can be so much more rewarding.  There was a small issue with our order and I must say the manager, Stephen came out and apologized and made it right for us.  I guess because we are so tied to our cell phones and the drive-thru, that we have forgotten what the human experience is and therefore, we rate our service based on that short interval of time instead of looking at the staff and the amount of work that is put into preparing and getting that order to you.  We need to start appreciating the demands that are put on the staff to get you your order all while doing it with a smile.  I will definitely come back to this location."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Popeyes restaurants in this part of town. It is a full service location and not part of a stinky gas station or quickie store. The inside is decorated with jars of chili peppers and other fun ingredients and there is a bigger seating area than some of the others stores. 

Usually stop in here when I'm in the area picking up some industrial parts for the shop. It is close to several vendors and a quick and easy meal when my stomach is growling for some Cajun yummies.

Normally order something off the Spicy side of the menu and get several Jalapenos to wash things down. The dark meat is a treat and I like to get a bunch of thighs and avoid the less juicy white meat. Must say that the Red Beans and Rice are also a favorite and like to save them for dessert.

Service is always super friendly and you will see some of the same people working here over the years. The orders come out pretty quick and the food is consistently very tasty.

Watch out for the bus load of school kids that walk over during their lunch break. The place can get really busy and the wait times can take longer than usual. Whatever happened to the lame brown bag lunches that we were forced to eat back in the days? 

See ya there next time and remember Tuesday they have their 2pc chicken special for super cheap. AYEE!

{"text":"Worst experience at Popeyes ever! I ordered the 16 piece spicy meal takeout and a Cajun poutine. Firstly they forgot the biscuits. Next they put in half mild and half spicy chicken without telling me. If that wasn't enough the chicken was salty as hell and the poutine hardly had any meat. When I called to complain no one would pick up and the answering machine memory was full."}
{"text":"Food was good, but seemed to be no air on as it was uncomfortably warm sitting in restaurant eating."}
{"text":"Have not been here in years, but a text message got me in the door to try the new Honey Hot chicken Tenders. So, the honey hot part comes in a container. You simply drizzle this sauce over the tenders and there you go. The tenders are quite large and crunchy as well. All the side dishes seemed fine to me as well. The fries were hot and crisp and also enjoyed an excellent biscuit. Nothing bad happened in the drive-through and the customer service was fine."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location...they never get my order right. I give my order and the girl asked me spicy or mild. I say spicy. I pulled up to pay and the girl forgets what I ordered. I get the order, drive off and pull over to eat the 2 pieces chicken  and the chicken is mild. I got ready to dig into the green beans and there are no napkins and or utensils. This Rainbow location goes through so many employees...now I know why!!! Very frustrating! I don't seem to have this problem with the other Popeye's location."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight and enjoyed it. The service was good and the young lady working the counter was friendly. The only disappointing part of the meal was them being out of Cajun rice but, it was 7:30 so I can understand. The chicken was very tasty and moist. I will be back to try more."}
{"text":"I absolutely love popeyes but I will NEVER be back to this location. My husband and I decided to go inside and eat. The lady at the register was rude and looked at me like I was stupid while I waited for her to greet me. I could hardly hear anything she was saying because she was talking so quietly. After waiting an hour the order after ours was called. I asked my husband to go ask about our order, when he asked, the manager told him that they just put his shrimp in the fryer. We, along with others asked for a refund and left with no food. I understand that even a fast food place gets backed up on orders but I wouldn't have waited an hour if 3 of the employees weren't sitting at a table cracking jokes. Very poorly managed."}
{"text":"Chicken was horrible ! I love Popeyes I swear I go but just because you are busy doesn't mean turn up the oil and cook the outside of the chicken and not the inside ... the reason why I am so upset is because when I tried to call the store they never answer the phone . After work I drove back there to explain the situation . I was not asking for a refund of money I would of been happy with a coupon or somthing . The manager Jacqueline!!! Needs to be FIRED . She sat there and had a smile on her face the whole time like it was funny . Told me she wasent going to do anything unless I have the chicken from 4 hours ago ... mind you I picked up food for a co-worker and myself on lunch . I called them while I was still on lunch 3 times and there was no answer . They when I told her what is so funny ... she started laughing . I'm going back up there tomorrow to see if there is a store manager  I can speak to . She was working at night so this might just be a shift leader manager or somthing .. I called corporate also and I'm making a follow up because she doesn't need to have a job if she wants to laugh in people's faces ... another thing !! When I went back up thereafter work there was two other people in line that had a complaint ! SAD SAD SAD ."}

{"text":"I love Popeyes Chicken. If we had one in Prescott Valley I would eat there all the time. But are you kidding me!!  This Popeyes was a serious contender for worst fast food ever!!!!  Clearly the grease was very dirty as the chicken tasted like old grease and you could not taste the seasoning. The staff...lol...who stands in the back acting like morons when you have customers up front waiting. Very very disappointed"}
{"text":"Ahhhh needed something quick because I had hangry people with me, so we decided to try this place.  HMMM chicken wasnt fully cooked and I didnt realize until my 2nd to last piece. Coleslaw not good, green beans not good.  Just not good!!!!"}
{"text":"Was there last night.  The drive thru line was extremely long,  so I thought that's a good sign. When you go to order there were no lights on so extremely hard to order. We ordered the 3 piece meal spicy with coleslaw with 2 orders of their sweet and spicy sauce. We also ordered 6 piece nuggets meal with fries and got ranch. Get home with our meal did not get the sweet and spicy sauce did not get chicken nuggets instead got spicy tenders. Was dissatisfied with coleslaw and chicken was ok.  Disappointed that order was wrong and was a waste of money.  We will not go back."}
{"text":"For being Popeyes, it's a great place. Previous stores weren't clean and the service was super slow. Took 5 days to get one meal (exaggeration). But this place great. Fast service and just plain good spicy chicken plus their fries are next level."}
{"text":"This Popeyes is near my home. I would go more often except that at least half the time they get my order wrong, and the staff apparently couldn't care less about it. Yesterday the family wanted Popeyes. I knew what was coming, and they didn't disappoint. I ordered a five piece chicken fingers dinner, plus a coupon special that came with five fingers, two sides and two biscuits - allegedly. I got the food home and found that the five finger combo had only three pieces of chicken in it (for over $9), the coupon special only had one biscuit, and there were no utensils for the sides. I drove back to the store, where I waited at the counter as employees ignored me for nearly five minutes. When one finally did approach me and I explained the problem, she asked, \"Do you want me to replace it?\" No, I drove all the way back here just to tell you this and leave. Just keep the extra money for the three pieces of chicken you gave me when I paid for five. Duh...

After all of that, the chicken tasted dry and stale after I got it home, like it had been cooked hours earlier and left to sit.

I have contacted corporate about this store before, and they apparently don't care either.  I have never gotten a response from either a store manager or anyone at the corporate office. Judging from the other comments here, the staff is costing them business and they aren't doing anything to fix it. This store has been open long enough that these problems should have been sorted long ago. If it were up to me, I would never patronize this store again, but the family likes Popeyes.

It might help if there were a visible manager on duty. I didn't see one yesterday."}
{"text":"Popeye's has always been one of my favorite chicken places in general. The lieutenant colonel and the one with the church name are somewhat on the bland side and are not my first choices for tasty chicken. 

This location has a few things to complain about. The neighborhood is not the best and it shares the same building with the Circle jerk guys next door. Usually find myself trying to get in and out rather quickly. The customers are always pretty loud and obnoxious and the place is not very clean. You might even be asked for money in the parking lot.

Service is basically poor and trying to communicate is difficult and a bit tricky. Normally have to repeat myself a few times to get the order correct. On my last visit experienced a triple sneeze by the cook right on my meal. Gesundheit!

Usually order the Spicy Chicken with a side of Beans and Rice. Can't resist getting several jalapenos to give the meal some additional kick. Sometimes I'll even go crazy and order one of the specials. Tried the Catfish on my last visit and was surprised how small it looked. Maybe they should just call it kitten fish?

Definitely recommend going to one of their full service restaurants that do not commingle with one of those fast trip places. Once had the occasion to eat in a really industrial part of Baton Rouge and enjoyed the meal so much more than this place. WHAT THE CLUCK?

2.25 STARS"}
{"text":"The chicken tenders are good but why can't you order just the tenders...you have to order a meal. WTF? I would've given 3 stars but the service was so slow and not very professional. The girl taking my order was carrying on a convo with another employee about nothing work related and it severely impeded her ability to move faster than a sloth. Not a good experience, it will be a while before I go back."}
{"text":"This place sadly doesn't participate in the Popeye's advertised Tuesday's 2 piece special...  So sad..."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch. The food was good. But my reason for yelping was there was a young man behind the counter who was absolutely an upbeat person. I walked away wishing that that kid worked for me."}
{"text":"Each time I go here, I swear I'll never go back. I guess I'm a sucker for punishment.  They NEVER get my order right.  I know I should check it each time but I hate holding up the car behind me.  The employees are young and don't understand the value of customer service. They never thank you for your order. My last order was their 'limited time only' waffle fried strips with special honey sauce. Guess what?  They were out of the sauce!  Completely ruined my meal. I won't be going back to this location. 

Well, I did go back!  It was worse this time. I bought the $5 Spicy Honey Strips. It might as well have been a cardboard box. I swear it was the worst chicken I have ever attempted to eat. I gagged!  It tasted like dried out fish. Needless to say, I didn't eat it. I went hungry that night."}
{"text":"Fast food? Took me over 12 min all the drive thru... and the said 15 min wait... this place it's the worst"}
{"text":"Our 8 piece family meal took well over 35 minutes.  The staff seemed confused and disorganized.   They were out of several things.  When the order was finally ready, they had forgot our side dish.  I'm glad I checked before I left.  There were no utensils included and they were out of butter for the biscuits.  The food was still yummy but they need to get their act together.  It is a new location and I expect that some of the employees are new.  I am willing to give them a little time to become more efficient."}
{"text":"Wow this place is gross. Maybe the food might be ok but this is the worst services. The inside was super messy and they were so uncoordinated. People have been waiting for over 30mins to get out food and the staff doesn't knw what order was next and who had what. Just horrible!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I think the food is the same as any other Popeye's. It's decent for the price fried chicken and the sauces are good, especially the blackened ranch and the mardi gras mustard. This is my boyfriend's food of choice after the bar, and the staff has always been friendly towards us. 

This location is pretty slow hough. They usually have 1 person working the register and every single time we order, they need to make more spicy tenders. Maybe we like it so much because they are always fresh and tasty. 

That said, it's fast food and not my top choice but it serves its purpose."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in over a year
I had a hankering for some chicken today and went up to Popeyes for the Saturday wing special. As stated It comes with 5 wings for $5.29 and I also ordered a biscuit just to see how they were. When I got out and checked my takeout order I was surprised to find the smallest wings I have ever seen however I was given 7 wings instead of 5. Tasty, a bit spicy and hot and crispy describes the wings. I am most pleased. By the way the biscuit was almost as good as my own made at home. I must remember to come by more often."}
{"text":"The slowest fast food drive thru. Not only do I always have to wait at least 15 minutes for my food, they usually forget something too. Something needs to be done about how slow the wait is."}
{"text":"Absolute worst franchise ran by Popeyes. Been here three times. Either received wrong order or short order. Also expect 15-25 minutes to wait for food from drive thru each time."}
{"text":"By far the very worst fast food in Silverado Ranch.  Even when busy the chicken is cold and the service beyond the worst. Poorly trained staff and a manager that is rude and clueless. Two weeks ago we stopped and grabbed food to eat at home while watching hockey. The order was all wrong and not even the correct number of pieces. 

When I took it back and showed the manager my receipt and exactly what I received he couldn't even tell me what the problem was; he had to ask the young dude working the window what the problem was. The manager then approved the young dude to \"get him what he didn't get yet\".  When the young man came over with the remaining pieces of chicken I was shorted I told him I didn't expect to have to eat cold chicken, the manager overheard me, came over to me, grabbed the bag from my hand, and slam dunk it in the trash can. Normal protocol would be to let the customer decide if he/she wanted to keep the wrong order and then get the order remade, hot and fresh.  Not at this Popeyes. Never an apology.  Never an offer for a Coke while I waited.  Never even looked me in the eye. This place is the WORST RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TO ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, And I travel extensively and eat fast food as often as anybody. STAY AWAY FROM HERE. As a matter of fact, as I was getting into my car to leave, two other gentlemen were walking in to the restaurant to get their orders corrected; each was owed food they paid for and didn't receive."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst food I have ever eaten! The coleslaw was lukewarm and too creamy, the chicken was way too crispy and there was hardly any 'meat' to the chicken, and the biscuit looked like it had been swimming face-down in a pool of butter. And then the cashier didn't give me my change; I had to tell her what my total was and the amount Of change I should get. Save your money or go to KFC! I honestly don't understand the appeal of this place. Never again!"}
{"text":"I won't be giving this particular store a review, but the chain, itself. Having visited several locations and actually lived in an apartment across the road from the Eglinton West location, I've seen it all: The good, the bad and the Biscuit.

I can't decide to give Popeye's 1 star or 5. It's not merely the inconsistencies in service, but sometimes it's just that you unapologetically WANT some greasy fried chicken! I liken the entire scenario of ordering Popeyes to watching Porn (back when you had to go to the store and rent it)--it occurs in three phases:

Craving

Mmmmm.... you know you want that greasy, crispy, hot and juicy fried chicken. You mouth waters and you think about how good it will taste. Maybe you've seen a little advertising fluffer on a billboard or TV and you can't get the need out of your head. But it's sort of dirty, you know? Like, maybe you don't want your friends to see you doing it, or anyone to see you walking in to that Popeyes's store, because it might mean a whole slew of dirty things about the person you are or your personal habits. But you're need for Chicken satisfaction overrides any embarrassment you might feel about walking in to that Popeye's store. You justify: After all, you're only human, right?

You do it. You go. And you order waaay too much chicken-- also some of those biscuits that are nothing but hydrogenated vegetable oil and white flour. You take it home, sit in front of the TV with the lights off and GORGE!

Satisfaction

You fast forward through the biscuits and go straight for that chicken. And you LOVE that freaking chicken. Like I mean, it's so hot, a little spicy and ohhh so juicy!! Oh god, this is the best chicken you've ever had... why don't you eat this EVERY DAY ALL THE TIME??? Yeah, it's dirty, but dirty-good, and so are you for eating it, really dirty, like actually FILTHY!! THE DIRTIEST FREAKING CHICKEN YOU'VE EVER EATEN IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!

Three pieces of Chicken later and now it's...


SHAME

Oh, God. I can't look at the box anymore. That orange box reminds me of how dirty I am. I'm really bad and I'm sure I gained 5 pounds in my ass alone (This part of he guilt is akin to having to return said rented porn), and everyone will see. I'm never eating that chicken again. Oh, never... I feel sick. I may even need a shower.

Thankfully, in this modern age, POPEYE'S DELIVERS so you can avoid all the embarrassment at the store, bypassing the whole process of face to face need and despair. What's next? On line chicken orders?

AND it comes in white or dark meat!"}
{"text":"If I can give this place a negative star I would but I chose not to because SOME of the employees there are very friendly. I keep coming back to this Popeyes because it is near my work hoping that maybe the \"next time\" they will have what I want.  I have been to this location an estimated 25 times this year and they have been out of spicy chicken OR white meat at least 20 times.  What's worse is that I called to share my feedback to customer service AND even shared it on their website LAST YEAR and the STILL have the same problems.  I don't call to complain and be difficult, I call because it is on my favorite chicken to have and it makes me angry that they still fail to make an effort to have enough product on hand.  I only got ONE response after multiple complaints and they have me a couple for a 2 piece chicken meal that had already expired by the time I got it in the mail.  Long story short, if you are open to constantly changing your meals because they run out of your favorite, this is the place to go.  Otherwise, don't waste your entire lunch time going here."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location. The service was bad. I had to wait 15 to 20 minutes for my order. The food was ok. Their mashed potatoes with gravy is better than church's chicken and kfc. The management team needs to work on their service.  The line was close to out of the door and there were upset customers in the dining area who have not received their food while the carryout customers received their food first.  Finally, I advise to check your orders because they forgot to give me one of my side orders. Get it together management of Popeye ' s  and staff."}
{"text":"Very unfriendly cashier.Came for the special advertised on TV.and was told this store does not honor the add I will never go back to thi store and tell as many people that I can the service I got."}
{"text":"This place was ridiculous. I went through the dive through and ordered food for my family. No one was behind me and as soon as I paid the manager told the kid at the window to ask me to pull forward. I asked why since there was no one behind me and the manager said that they were checking my order to make sure it was correct. (Total lie) I just waited there at the window and the manager came over and gave me my food and also the stink eye. Once I got home to a house full of hungry people the order was incorrect. This has happened so many times at this location I had to give them a bad review. The manager on duty was extremely rude and if he was the one checking my order then maybe they might need to look into new management."}
{"text":"They are almost always busy! I've been here a couple times and the majority of the customers seem to come in for takeout. 

The area inside isn't very large, so there ends up being lots of people standing around and crowding around, waiting for their orders. 

The chicken is as good as you'll get almost anywhere, but their mashed potatoes are definitely better than other places. 

Would come by if you want takeout chicken, but definitely wouldn't eat in store."}
{"text":"this location SUCKS!! the food is never hot, they skimp on the portions and the manager is a damn joke. i've given it a few chances but now i will never return here again! they know they messed up my order yet again and are refusing to answer the phone now... so unprofessional!! the manager clearly stated multiple times that only lettuce and pickles came on the po boy. i get one and there's mayo ALL over it. she had the nerve to give me an attitude when i drove back through the drive thru and asked them to remake it without mayo. she stayed out of sight when she clearly picked out the skimpiest driest tenders, a few shreds of lettuce on the untoasted bun and then continued to very obviously smash the sandwhich in her hand before giving it to the kid at the window. i asked the kid to have her remake it yet again but do it RIGHT this time and she told him she wouldn't do it but she would only give me another cold ass tender. i've called 9 times to find out this lady's name and they won't answer. save yourself the hassle and pass this place up"}
{"text":"Just left.....we ordered our food and was told the wait should be two minutes because we were waiting on our apple
Pies. 10 minutes later I go to the counter. I see our food sitting back there ready to be bagged, the cashier sees this also and tells the two young girls by the food to get the food ready... but these two are to busy talking. Not about work but going somewhere. Really? Great customer service and customer satisfaction goes a long way, something this place knows nothing about. Teach ur employees better"}
{"text":"Manager was helpful with recommendation of what to get as this was our first time here. She even suggested a better deal as my husband and I shared a meal. After we got out meal I mentioned to her \"I was sorry to bother her for a water cup\" and she kindly made me feel so good by replying, \"bother me? No, never, of course!\"  Super sweet!"}
{"text":"First time there I waited 15 minutes for my order of a chicken burger combo. By the time I got my meal my girlfriend was already finished her meal. I think they purposely took their time with my meal because I had a difficult time understanding the cashiers questions about the options for my chicken burger. I was not rude at all to her,  but she definitely had a resentful tone towards me because of it. The second time there after eating my meal I went to the bathroom and I ended up stepping in human feces. Worst fast food experiences I've had in any city at any franchise."}
{"text":"Took 45min just to get our food from the drivethru. I'm 100% sure they didn't even make our order and had us wait outside for 20min, and even after going in and asking why our food isn't ready, their reply of \"few more minutes\" took an additional 20-25min! POS service and will NEVER come back here."}
{"text":"I come here once in a while and I'm always satisfied. Really good management and great"}
{"text":"The worst service twenty-five min.to get order. No cocktail sauce no tarter sauce. Finally get order and its  raw.  Now can't even get money back. NEVER EVER AGAIN...  AND TO TOP IT NO ONE ELSE WAS THERE."}
{"text":"This location can be so slow at times (I went at around 5pm on a thursday). A huge line up formed and everyone was getting annoyed because of the long wait. I waited maybe 15 minutes for my thursday special.

The food is normal, which is pretty much the same one would expect everywhere else.

Quality: 7/10. Service: 5/10. Value: 6/10. Overall: 5/10 (Not an average)."}
{"text":"My food came out super fast and it was really hot! Trina at the cash register was also very pleasant. Overall great experience!!!"}
{"text":"Good simple fried chicken with lots of side choices. They just need to keep the dirty bums out! When people are waiting in line or eatin they keep coming in and asking for money. The employees don't seem to care about this but it ruins the whole dinner."}
{"text":"Great location, clean, fast service & great food! My new favorite place for fried chicken.Love the choices of sides."}
{"text":"Unhappy staff. I like Popeyes' chicken. However, our drive through experience definitely lacked luster. First, they did not correctly fill my order. I ordered chicken tenders and they gave me mixed pieces. When I walked in to get my order corrected, the manager was grumbling at their staff like a tired teacher exhausted from telling their students to write their names on their papers for the millionth time. The server nonchalantly refilled my order and chucked a bunch of random sauces in my bag, forgetting the one sauce requested: Ranch. After such welcome, our chicken tasted flat. I don't think I will be back to this location."}
{"text":"Worst Popeyes's I've ever been to I sat in the drive through for a solid ten minutes until I could place my order. Once I got to window I was informed that the fries I ordered would take an additional 5 mins or I could switch since I was on break at lunch I opted to change sides. Only to receive my food and it all be ICE COLD WAIST OF MONEY"}
{"text":"I see reviews on here that make it sound like a terrible place to eat. I must say that some people tend to overreact. I, however beg to differ. The meal was fantastic, it was ready before i even got my change back. The man who took my order was delightful, he directed me through the whole menu and was super friendly. He asked me to do the survey on the back of the reciept and told me about the free 2 piece and biscuit. The place looked great and i enjoyed my meal. When i excited i was thanked and told to have a great day. I will surely come back."}
{"text":"Absolute worst service ever. Do not come here. Flat sodas. Terrible customer service. I was given no hot sauce when I specifically asked for it. all around terrible experience."}
{"text":"I thought this was going to be one of my favorite restaurants love red beans and rice ordered dinner they're real quick fast kind of rude a little bit at the drive-thru window obviously they don't care didn't get any red beans and rice with my 8-piece family meal although I paid for it      oh my next day found beans in my car must have slipped out of bag  (Crow pie)"}
{"text":"Customers service did  not exist on our visit. Hirable!  and what a ripoff on food we had  2 pieces  of chicken  backs on a 4 piece meal. Chicken backs have very little meat and that's what you're paying for. Money not well spent! I say run!"}
{"text":"How could you not enjoy this chicken ?... Its cooked to perfection and always hot out the fryer... Thank popeyes!"}
{"text":"I buy 9 pieces of chicken you count this piece of small wing as one piece of chicken? 
 
Won't come back again.... 
When I read people wrote the review at this place say how bad it was... Now I believe it with my own expericne."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about Popeye's catering and this location specifically!  We placed a large catering order for a fundraising event for a non-profit and we could not be happier.  The food was wonderful and the presentation was great.  Our guests were so impressed!  Popeye's might not be the first thing that comes to your mind when looking for catering, but it should be!  

The district manager, Eddy was an absolute pleasure to work with.  He spent extra time with us to get the menu just right for our 300 guests.  Eddy made the whole process easy and his attention to detail is second to none."}
{"text":"Surprised this location has such a high star rating. Service is faster and more pleasant than other locations. However the food isn't of the same quality. I had onion rings and there were only two true onion rings to be found. The rest were broken bits of batter. See pic I'm not kidding. The chicken pieces are considerably smaller than I've had in the past. Don't know if it's the quality at just this location or if all Popeyes has diminished. Also it's not cheap. $1.99 for one corn on the cob!"}
{"text":"Rude staff member= nasty food
Food cold and not fresh
NASTY NASTY NASTY"}
{"text":"I go to this Popeyes a lot because it's close to my work at body heat tanning and I always seem to have a problem. I went today around 3 the girl on the speaker was very rude I said \"can I get a lot of ranch\" and she said \"blackened ranch?\" Then I said \"no just regular ranch\" I get to the front and some nice girl was the cashier I could tell by their voices that they were different. I asked for spicy tenders but she said I would have to wait which I was fine with. Then she asked if I wanted blackened ranch and I said \"no regular ranch\" and then the girl who was on the speaker comes to the window and the cashier tells her regular ranch and then the other girl responded with \"oh my god why do people have to be so dumb\" and the cashier shut the window so fast. I waited for my food and I get to work and they gave me the wrong tenders I asked for spicy and I got regular. Really wish people had more common sense in the work place."}
{"text":"Today I bought food from the location in the mall i have to say that I am very disappointed when I got home with the food there was a hair fried together with t chicken i took it back to them and the manager did care ."}
{"text":"The food is pretty typical for Popeyes, but I have been disappointed by the service here on multiple occasions...Definitely below the Popeyes average for service."}
{"text":"Yum yum. Come on Tuesdays, $1.49 for 2 pieces of fried chicken (thigh and wing), spicy or not-spicy, and in unlimited quantities! (That's actually the only day I go, hah!)

On Tuesdays, the floor can be dirty, especially with everyone flinging around pieces of fried chicken and biscuits. Inevitably, some land on the floor. :( And it can be a madhouse with each person ordering 20 pieces of fried chicken. But don't worry, just wait and the crispy, oily, cholesterol-filled goodness will overtake you."}
{"text":"Worst Popeyes Ever! Parking lot is ridiculous, service is terribly slow, had to repeat my order several times and I still had to correct the person at the window. I ordered 3 of the 5 piece chicken strip meals and 1 spicy 5 strip. Then I was told that they just had a fresh batch of chicken but only had enough chicken for 2 mild and 2 spicy? Then it wasn't ready so I had to drive around to the parking lot again, which takes an impressive act in that area if you have a big vehicle. I was told to make 2 u turns basically to get back around...the light is marked for no u turns! None of the boxes were marked, we didn't get any dipping sauces we asked for, no drink carrier. Dr Pepper and Lemonade both were also out which is the only drinks we drink other than water."}
{"text":"The chicken strips I got were burnt to death and the staff was a joke. This place used to be good I don't know is there's different management now but just awful all the way around. I will not be eatting at that popeyes ever again."}
{"text":"3/11/2018 Sunday night!
Anthony... If you aren't the manger, you will be soon. Your service was TOP NOTCH!!!! The food speaks for itself. Great chicken and awesome sides! But back to Anthony. This guy could not of been more friendly and nice. This kid will keep me coming to this Popeye's. Superb customer service kid! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Ruined me and my girlfriend 4th of July got our food got home ate about 20 minutes later diarrhea and I know it was the Popeyes because it was very spicy and I got the spicy chicken tenders I am definitely making up for it today."}
{"text":"Unlike KFC, here they know how to make fried chicken right, and cheap too, particularly on Tuesdays when they practically give it away."}
{"text":"I stopped in to get dinner and unfortunately due to a mix up, I waited a very long time. 
However, the gentlemen behind the counter were very apologetic and made the visit worth it. 

Very good, humble personnel at this location. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. But the customers I encountered were very racist towards immigrants and were ready to get physical. If you go here as an immigrant, stand up for yourself."}
{"text":"Decent place for friend chicken and biscuits. Service is sometimes a bit slow. Parking can be a pain, the complex is busy with a lot of other shops. 

When you're not waiting for your food, it's usually hot and delicious. Had a bad experience recently when the chicken strips were cold. But 9 times out of 10 it's fine. 

Inside is clean and has a tv with news/sports, would be a good place to sit down to eat.

Update: food temperature has been good since but on average it seems to take 8-10 minutes to get your food."}
{"text":"Came here to enjoy lunch with my boyfriend..... initially Cashier was extremely friendly, courteous and made recommendations.  She was great.  

But since when does it take 25 minutes to make 6 freaking chicken tenders ?! At 20 minutes I asked the cashier how long it takes to cook chicken tenders, she said 5 minutes.  5 ? So why was I still standing there waiting? It took 25 minutes.  I work in the food business so I understand when it is busy etc, but there was no one else there when we ordered. And someone who came in and ordered after us, got his food before we did.  Unacceptable. 

Speed of service is ridiculous, my boyfriend didn't even get to eat his food because he had to go back to work.  

Extremely annoyed.   I am not blaming the cashier.  I am blaming the cooks who kept yelling out \"it's burnt\".  And obviously poor management.  No one from management came to apologize or see what was going on."}
{"text":"This was the only restaurant open near eaton center on christmas eve around 8pm. It was pretty busy with consistant line ups that day and you figure the food would be very fresh but boy was i wrong.The worst customer service ever compared to all the popeyes I went to before. My order was 4 piece chicken meal and 9 piece nuggets meal.The chicken wasn't fresh, really dry and not even hot. The nuggets were cold so I went to the cashier to complain and asked if they could make me new ones, he said it's fresh and we don't make new ones only re heat it. I told him to try a piece but he wouldn't but they did re fry my nuggets. You could see the back with piles of chicken already made, who knows what time it was sitting there. I will never go back or recommend anyone to that location since they weren't willing to make me fresh nuggets."}
{"text":"The chicken is good but the service leaves a lot to be desired.  And make sure what you ordered is what you get, I ordered apple pies and got blueberry,  mashed potatoes got rice or nothing, etc. And the corn in the cob was nasty and cold. My advise; don't go through the drive- thru (takes forever) and check the bag before leaving."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why this popeyes would even take your order because they never get it right.  I think it's to many teenagers playing there because it very little work being done. If you want what you ordered go somewhere else!"}

{"text":"Do not waste your time or money. 100% shit hole. Went at noon today was told they are put of shrimp for the day!!!! ONLY been open for 2 hours, please go out of business and replace with a decent fast food option"}
{"text":"Doh! I guess I should have read the reviews.  My order was completely wrong and I didn't realize it until I arrived home.  I don't get it.  It's not that difficult to ring up an order correctly.  I've worked in a fast food place before and it's easy.  Furthermore, how difficult is it to give customers fresh fries and fresh chicken? I ordered a five dollar box of shrimp and a five dollar box of chicken tenders (both with fries).  What I received was a box with a breast, thigh, and fries and another box with chicken tenders and fries that had obviously been under the heat lamp for quite awhile.  I also requested sauce and didn't receive any.  Oh but they did put two spoons in the bag which left me a little perplexed since I didn't order anything that would require a spoon.  Come on man!"}
{"text":"Very sloooow service!  Not much customer service.  No smile or apology for the wait!  Left, did an errand and food is still not ready.  If you are in a hurry, get your food elsewhere.  Not FAST food!!"}
{"text":"Out of all the fried chicken fast food restaurants, Popeye's in my opinion tops all.
I had a layover at McCarran coming from Houston and found this Popeye's roaming around the Southwest Terminal. I probably missed seeing Popeye's before since it's a bit past the tram which I take instead of walking that long terminal.

It's pricey at this location as one expects to be at the airport. $8 for 12 piece nuggets, a side, biscut, and drink. My fav here is not the chicken, it's the red beans and rice. The nuggets were small but tasty and better than Chick Fil A. I inhaled my food. If you're really hungry, you'll want to order something bigger.This was a snack for me."}
{"text":"Very good overall, the coleslaw was a little dry maybe that is just the way the do it in Lousiana."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location in awhile but they use to have the most amazing people working here.  When I say \"amazing\" I mean people who are not afraid to tell you to off if you complain about the wait...they knew that they were the only Popeys in town...hehe.  Now that we have numerous locations Im not sure their as abrasive.

Always great fried chicken!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I both ordered combo meals with breast peices, and we ordered extra bisquits.  The chicken was crispy, hot and juicy!! The bisquits were Soooooooo good, I like them with butter and honey... the sides were ok.... they would have gotten five stars, except the cashier was rude, and we had to wait about twenty five minutes for our food, we were told they would bring our food to our table after checking on it for the third time... but they didnt bother to, so we went up and got it."}
{"text":"Stopped at the Plaza at 9:55 and ask the lady at the register if they were closed and she said YES and didn't mention the drive thru was open until 11pm.  Very rude and zero customer service.  Even said Yelp had the close time at 11pm and she didn't have a clue."}
{"text":"Worst freakin location. It never fails when I come here they get my order wrong. I keep thinking oh I'll give them one more chance surely they can't screw up again.. but NOPE. I'm done. Ridiculous. 

The drive thru- I think they try to move so fast that they don't listen. Inside doesn't have an excuse. They just suck and don't listen. Every time I've been here in the past year they've gotten my order wrong. I work right down the street so I've come at the very least once a month. So disappointing because I know how good the food CAN be."}
{"text":"Since my family and I moved at this location 2015, we visit Popeyes every other month. Out of all our visits, our orders have only been completely correct 2 times. Our orders have always been incomplete, either they forget the biscuits, kids meal, drink, mashed potatoes and instead of giving straws in the bag they give spoons. But we never bothered to go back because we're already home and when we try to call it's always answering machine. The drive thru staff have always been kind and friendly but today they had one at the drive thru that is not friendly at all. Then as always, we got home and notice he never gave us our meal drink. So for the first time I went back and inform the person at the cash register and he said what's missing, then he just gave me my cup . We as customers do need to check our orders before leaving the drive thru, but as always we choose to go buy fast food when our days have been hectic and the last thing we want is to experience long wait for our food and incomplete orders and what more is to end up complaining about the meal we're about to eat. I just hope that one day, one manager will correct all issues unhappy customers go through."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting and horrible service. The chicken is dry, the sides taste old and the people at the drive thru don't know how to do their job."}
{"text":"This is the worst location! Avoid at all costs. The employees are terrible and you have to wait 10-15 for your food."}
{"text":"The food is great, so I'm not gonna knock that, but I ordered 5 meals and 2 out of the 3 were correct! At one point in time they didn't even give me one of my meals! I had to ask for it! The fish and shrimp combo hardly had food in it! And they were missing there sides... the only reason why the 2 of the three was correct because one of them was the meals that were missing! Like really? Get your service up man!"}
{"text":"It is very clean in here.  No TVs, which I like.  Garlic and chile chicken is good.  Love the Mardi Gras mustard sauce and biscuits.  Military discount."}
{"text":"So expensive! I guess that is the price of airport food .  5 piece chicken tenders costs $9.72 plus tax."}
{"text":"Why is it that i can go to Virginia or Kentucky and get exceptional service but i live in PA and Popeyes their second try up here. Have the nastiest attitudes up here. I mean you tables aren't washed. Your counters look like a baby was changed on them and the manager oh let me tell you....makes Miss Havasham from Annie look good. I am sick of this. I say Popeyes goes bye bye from Pittsburgh and never come back. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"The cashier (Robert) was so busy trying to tell me how to save a few pennies that he couldn't get what I ordered right. Very frustrating. Just give me what I ordered. Service was really slow. They definitely need to improve in this area. I go to this Popeye's cause its close to my house, but soon I will have to find somewhere else to go, if they do not improve."}
{"text":"It's extremely disappointing to find out that your Las Vegas locations NEVER have enough mild chicken to complete an 8 piece family meal. We have been to three locations so far and each time we've tried to order an 8 piece meal and EACH TIME your stores have told us they don't have enough mild chicken and that I would need to wait 12-15 mins. It doesn't matter what time of the day I go, your stores always tell me they don't have enough chicken! 

My most recent visit was to your S. Rainbow location (store# 10732), we placed our order via drive thru with a female team member. We told her we wanted the 8 pc family meal and she gave us our total and told us to drive up. I was so relieved when she didn't say they ran out of chicken. So, we drive up and wait about 2-3 mins when a male employee came to the window to deliver the news, \"we don't have enough mild chicken to complete the 8pc but I can throw in some spicy chicken. If I wanted spicy I would have ordered spicy! I wish I had the male employee's name, but the 'Employee Name' noted on my receipt states \"Order Taker\". At this point, I'm extremely annoyed that we were not advised of this BEFORE we placed our order. We were going to cancel it, then your male employee told us he would throw in some pies and a drink while we wait. I was still hesitant because PIES doesnt change the fact you had us waiting in the drive thru just to tell us the SAME THING EVERY SINGLE TIME WE TRY TO ORDER FROM YOUR STORE.... \"WE DONT HAVE ENOUGH MILD CHICKEN!\" Why offer a drive thru when you have to park and wait for your food every time? Is this your definition of fast food? 

We agree to wait because your male employee also stated it wouldn't take the whole 15 mins. So, we wait and then he finally walks out with our order. As we're driving away... I check the bag and  Surprise, Surprise... NO PIES were found! So, now your employees are resorting to LYING in order for your customers to agree to wait? Is this the type of customer service your company allows your employees to provide....Lying? Why don't you teach your employees to provide the TRUTH? Don't offer something that you're actually not going to give. Instead of diffusing the situation, all your employee did was fuel my anger and resentment towards my overall experience with Popeyes. I definitely won't be visiting another Popeyes location any time soon and I will ensure that my family and friends do the same thing! This is the worst customer service you can provide to ANYONE. For a company that mainly sells chicken, you NEVER cook enough of it!"}
{"text":"I'm from Louisiana and as such have had a lot of Popeye's in my day. From a food quality perspective, this place is no better or worse than others. And since this is airport food you have to expect that it's going to be pricier than normal. However, the service here is really sub par, even for Popeye's, and I've never really been able to figure out quite why. Long lines but 3 employees on break, cashiers who don't know how to ring things up, etc. Come here if you're really jonseing for Popeye's, but expect a little bit of heartache."}
{"text":"We came and got dinner and the girl,who took our order does not seem to know her job. We ordered or food and she didn't take our drinks. Then we pull up and she isn't nice at all and forgot our sides and has no manners and doesn't say thank you. Every time we have came here there is always something. They told us to pull up one time to wait for our food 20 minutes later we had to go through the drive thru and they forgot about us. This place needs better management and workers."}
{"text":"You should really keep driving unless you have 20minutes to wait to order.  Yeah I am NEVER bothering with this place again.  Food has been ok, but last two times, the wait was ridiculous until they even acknowledged me.  I think they must have 2 people working this place.  Even with NO cars in front of you,  the drive thru is slow as ever.  Inside.. just as bad but a tight fit inside a gas station.   Prices are way higher than they should be.... Go a mile up to taco bell. They actually have employees that work.....whataburger is just as bad too btw, McDonald's on southern is 10x faster."}
{"text":"Honestly it's not as horrible as the past reviewers are saying; people it's a fast food restaurant not Flemings or Mortons; calm down.  Ask for the chicken to be cooked fresh and they will do it; complaining about a fast food restaurant cracks me up; and the chick that said putting peppers is the gravy was gross hello that's what Popeyes does in all their restaurants; as long as it's clean the health department gives them an A rating then you get what you purchase."}
{"text":"It's good chicken lol I'm not sure why so many two stars; people it's fast food not Mortons."}
{"text":"When it comes to fried chicken I look no further than Popeye's, and their amazing cajun seasoned masterpiece."}
{"text":"To be nice I gave it 3 stars. The food was alright, the service was really good. We didn't even have to wait. I wasn't impressed with their dining area, it was so dirty. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"To be honest this joint should be 1.5. But here, today, I don't feel to round up to 2. 

Popeyes is undoubtedly the best fried chicken a chain has to offer to its clientele. 
But at this location there are few things that are essentially important for a food joint to keep in check so that customers can plan to come back again:
- fast service: the biz falls under the category of FAST food right? Well, this one it ain't. 
- friendliness: not a very welcoming approach. 
- flavour: some of us ordered a spicy chicken (some ordered tenders some other the wings or the Cajun sandwich). It's supposed to be spicy: once again, it ain't. 

Gotta be honest though: this time the food wasn't greasy at all, it was well fried, but this is all I have to give them in favour. Anything else, unfortunately not. 
Turn to other Popeyes if you don't mind walk/drive a bit.

Or, if you feel more like for an independent joint, you might want to give it a try to a new restaurant  not far from this location that turns these little birds into a full flavour experience: \"The Dirty Bird Chicken + Waffles\" on 79 Kensington Ave."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here.  The staff is really nice, and their service is really good.

They take all my popeye's coupons, no trouble"}
{"text":"Gave them another try with their fried shrimp.  It was very tasty and flavorful.  It was moist and not overcooked. Redbeans are always good including  the cold slaw"}
{"text":"This place has ruined the Popeye's experience for me. The staff is rude, and the manager let's not even talk about her. The place is so dirty i am afraid i may catch a disease. I won't be to anymore Popeye locations after this. Very deplorable the corporation or owners should be ashamed of themselves for letting this place look and be like this."}
{"text":"I have gotten takeout and dined in at this Popeyes probably 10 times now. Every single time, the food has been hot, fresh, and perfect. The restaurant interior itself is bright and modern, and it's never been overly dirty. The employees are friendly, even if they are a little flustered and busy. And they have one of those Coke machines where you can mix your own drink! Overall, I will come back to this Popeyes time and again - it's the only fast food my snobby palate even eats anymore. The chicken (spicy), fries, and biscuits are above and beyond KFC and Bojangles, so give it a try if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"Slow service, oily chicken and burnt biscuits.I can't understand why the wait is so long when the food isn't fresh. This is the only place for fried chicken in Stouffville, so i guess they don't need to get better. Oh Ya, Parking is impossible if the Tae Kwon Do school next door is in."}
{"text":"Everybody loves popeyes but everybody hates when they forget a side 3 strikes you get a review."}
{"text":"Fan of their food, but not the store, service, or parking.  Place gets packed on Tuesdays for their 2 piece deal.  Can't go wrong at this place for crispy chicken.  Location is pretty small (only a few tables).  Their fountain drinks are shared with Terrible's gas station (actually cheaper to buy a cup from Terrible's).  It's a fast-food joint, so you can't expect good service.  Always check to see if they gave you the correct number of pieces you ordered.  They don't offer you hot sauce or napkins, so you have to ask.  

Parking here is a pain (especially on Tuesdays)."}
{"text":"There aren't too many popeyes around town.  I always love finding one on tuesdays to take advantage of their 2 piece tuesdays.  Luckily, there is one near my work place and I tend to sneak off to go get a box for me and my coworkers.  

This location is an actual popeyes unlike the others that are shared with a Terrible's gas station.  Place does get pretty busy during lunch.  

The service is fair, ordering is a bit difficult because they will not give you a few separate boxes for a few pieces.  A little difficult since I'm buying for a few people.  They do provide me with paper plates so I guess it works out.  

Environment is themed to Louisana and there are plenty of tables to sit after ordering.  Parking is a plenty and it is shared with Chevron.  

I def will come back but maybe will come before the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Good by !!! KFC you had a great run !!! Popeyes is the best the chicken was hot the mashed was awesome they didn't charge me for extra sauce the food was the best . KFC you should just shut your doors it's over"}
{"text":"I love Popeyes in general. I like the red beans, biscuits and spicy chicken. The service at this location is horrible. The wait is extremely long everytime! There have been plenty of times I wanted to stop but saw the line and drove pass. This must be a managerial issue for the service to be like this always. Sometimes I drive all the way to the  Craig location."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with this location of Popeye's. I love the chicken, but I hate the service. 

My food has always been spot on, but staff is unorganized and appear to not give a flying rats ass about what they are doing. I've seen them argue with each other, talk down to customers, and use language general reserved for the schoolyard. I personally don't care, but with coworkers who've joined me for lunch walked out feeling uncomfortable. 

At the end of the day they still make awesome fried chicken, and that's what really matters."}
{"text":"Above average for chain food. The chicken is well prepared and tasty. Somewhat longer wait than your typically fast food experience. The staff is attentive and courteous. The dining facilities are strictly functional, but get the job done. A frequent choice for take out at our house."}
{"text":"I know its fast food but any business in the service industry has standards and specifications. Occasionally I get a taste for fried chicken. I am also a fan of cajun style food. The last few times I decided to give them a chance; the staff were rude, the wait was long, and the food was blah. Even with their Tuesday special I will not be back no matter how much I crave something greasy and spicy."}
{"text":"They ruined our order twice. Bad oil / burned the first time. Then they gave us undercooked / original the second time when we had ordered spicy. I asked for fresh biscuits since we had to drive all the way back to return the food, and the food was no longer fresh. They told me they could only replace the chicken because the chicken was the only thing wrong with the order. I asked to talk to the manager and was able to get the biscuits, but they made me feel like they were doing me some huge favor. Another lady's order was ruined too (with the bad oil) and the manager was trying to argue with her. Unbelievable. Well, she got her money back and then we got our money back. Lady told us they messed up her order the last 6 times she was there. No one even said \"sorry.\" Customer is never wrong, guys. Get your process, your team and your attitudes together. Poor representation of Popeyes. If you live in Gilbert, go to the one by Pecos instead. We went there after getting our refund and they were so understanding and good to us. Dreell was the manager at the Pecos location. This location could learn a thing or two or 100 from the Pecos location."}
{"text":"If you live in Gilbert and want Popeyes, GO HERE. The Queen Creek Popeyes on Higley ruined our order TWICE and then argued with us about it so we got our money back and came here instead. Dreell, the shift manager and the crew who was working with him were so understanding and good to us. It was refreshing, to say the least. Food's bomb too! Keep it up guys"}
{"text":"Went there once drive threw ordred 2 fish dinners
Was told to park out front and they would bring it to us after 15 minutes i went inside and they forgot about us. We finaly got our fish and they were  so small i was still hungery. Rather then make a fus i got n line and told them what happened. Not a word back. I will never go back there ever. Terrible to treat people that way."}
{"text":"Terrible management. 
The drive through worker told me it would be 7min for mild. Totally fine. I pulled forward and waited. Over the next several minutes I witness several cars go through and the window worker just looking at me every once in a while. After 21min I decided to call management. First call rang a dozen times, no answer. Second, same. Third time I finally got through. Person I spoke to claimed to be the manager and sent my order out. Neither the manager nor the person who gave me my food apologized or anything. Wasn't looking for a free meal, just the courtesy of an apology for forgetting about their customer.

Food is fine, they have a screaming deal on Tuesdays. There's one young man that works the window on occasion that's really friendly."}
{"text":"Good place ftiendly service  i ask for fresh fries. The cashier was like the fries are fresh. They just took them out the fryer five min ago. But the manager over heard and gave me fresh fries and apologize for the way the cashier responded."}
{"text":"Gone here a few times and everyone is chill and hospitable and professional. One time order room longer than expected,  wasn't even worried about it knew they were going to be awhile since they just went in the fryer, just relaxing waiting when the manager comes up and informs me and gives me some extra due to the inconvenience.  They all Deserve raises, just saying,  #FeelTheBern"}
{"text":"Only uncomfortable restroom that I was not satisfied in this restaurant.  Nice cashier and smile employees made me happy in the late afternoon. Food also was good but not reasonable price."}
{"text":"Not only is this location very slow, they will give you all of one type of chicken...all thighs or all breasts. No variety whatsoever. Tonight i forgot to tell them to mix it up, which you shouldn't have to do by the way, and ended up with 12 thighs. Lucky for them I'm too tired to go back and argue, but I'll find somewhere else to go next time."}
{"text":"Food is adequate. Very slow. Receipt did not have detail information to redeem free chicken."}
{"text":"I ordered the smoky garlic and chile fingers with a side of coleslaw and it was horrible. The coleslaw could do better if they take the relish out and  the fingers had neither a garlic or chile taste to them. They were simply bad tasting.  The only good thing about this meal was the sweetened Iced Tea which I love."}
{"text":"Ok, to be clear - I love my popeyes!.  I love fried chicken.

Popeye's does Fried Chicken right.  They even make really good biscuits. 

Well, at least that has been my experience for years.

I have been to this particular location a few times now.  This was my fourth time here in the last 18 months.

One thing is consistent.  this is not a fast food joint.  They have consistently been way too slow.  each time it has taken 15 plus minutes to get my orders.  This last one on 5/8/15 took well over 20 minutes in the drive through.  It was only a 16 piece family pack.  Granted it was a Friday evening, but they should be prepared for that.

Chicken was great.  Biscuits, which I always love, were over basted with whatever the buttery sauce was.  They seemed to be swimming in it.  I know some may say that I should not complain, but they were not so good.

I think the thing that set this last visit apart was the front line manager reprimanding an employee right in front of me (granted, I was in my car in the drive up window), but I saw the whole thing.  Not cool for customers to see.  Maybe he needed the correction, but not in front of customers.

Never got any honey or offer of honey for the biscuits, which of course you don't notice until you get all the way home.

Last note - this is a very small location attached to a Circle K.  Not much room for standing in line or eating.  Seems like a need to expand it or move it."}
{"text":"First time to this location. Ordered and was out of the drive in less than 5 minutes. The four star Review is due to them being out of couple fountain drinks when I went to the drive-through"}
{"text":"Called for delivery ordered fish and shrimp combo and I got popcorn shrimp and a piece of chicken !!! Very disappointing because I don't eat chicken ! The Rice is dry and bland  what happened to you?????"}
{"text":"Huge line-up at lunch. Well, this is Dundas Square and across from Eaton Centre, so that's sort of expected.

They don't give order numbers or anything, so you're pretty much standing in a crowd of people waiting for them to call your order, so stay alert or someone else might take your order.

There are two floors at this location, and each floor has room for 20 seats, which is pretty big.
They seem to keep the lights dim on the upper-floor, which may be for the purposes of romance. Or perhaps when employees realize that people are actually going upstairs, they'll go and turns the lights on. But it gets really crowded at lunch so you can't really blame them.

Chicken was not too greasy as I have heard about fried chicken places.
Battered skin was nice and crispy. Spicy chicken wasn't all that spicy; the cajun fries were spicier. Fries were nice and crispy as well.

Judging from the looks of the kitchen, they just make a bunch of food and then leave it there until people order them. As a result, you may end up getting ones that have been sitting out for awhile, which can result in poor quality. 

For $5 ($3.29 tuesday special, plus $1.25 for a side), it's alright.
Bring your own rice and veggies"}
{"text":"This isn't the first time I've had Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. I love fried chicken, but this place isn't all the best for that. I ordered what I normally get. The 2 piece combo, mild with all white meat. The breast seemed really dry today. But the wing was good. I do not like their biscuits, so I didn't even try it. But my boys enjoyed it. I'll probably be back because my husband loves their spicy chicken fingers and fries."}
{"text":"Ok, I had to return for an updated review on Popeye's Chicken and Biscuits. Someone must had a phone call form corporate because the restaurant is a lot cleaner than it used to be the last time I came here.

My goodness, I was about to go to the dollar store and buy them some cleaning supplies but now everything looks organized and a place I want to eat.

Anyways, customer service is always been wonderful and helpful. The chicken was fresh and the sides were delicious.  They give you so much honey that I asked my boyfriend if he could be my \"biscuit\" with the left over packets.

I can't wait to order more food from this place!"}
{"text":"Terrible establishment with clueless workers. The manager had no idea what he was doing. It took them 25 minutes to cook some nuggets and they messed up the 3 orders before me in a row. Came here on my lunch break and wasted my whole break waiting for my food and didn't even get to eat it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE..."}
{"text":"I think perhaps fast food chicken places hire the most stupid of all employees available to the fast food industry.

We have stopped here a few times to pick up food and eat it at home. Not once have we gotten what we ordered. Ok I am sure now you are thinking I must be the most stupid of customer for not checking before I leave. Well yeah I agree with you. But this last time we ordered 12 pieces, I did look in the bag to see that all that we ordered was there. I did not take the chicken out to count it, we got eight pieces. Gus called to complain and all they said was, what am I supposed to do about it? So I will answer that question now, Nothing do nothing and I will wise up and just bypass your store from now on."}
{"text":"Quick takeout chicken meal deal and fussy family tastebuds demands quality tasty chicken.  Enter Popeyes halal chicken and sides such as Mac and Cheese, Mash and Gravy, Cajun Fries, Red Bean and Rice, or Coleslaw.  My son goes crazy for the Biscuits....Delicious!  Used mobile app coupon to get a free large side.  Fast service for 20 mild chicken pieces; spicy was the other option.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"The Sunday daily special is 2 Chicken Minis for $4.29 which you can make into a combo for an extra $1.29 for each item.  ALERT: the window sign from afar looks like the fries and fountain drink is $1.29 for both...NOT!!  Combo total is $6.87 plus taxes equals $7.76 for \"the deal\".

The food prep time was slow even though it was moderately busy. Large brightly lit clean seating area.  Pop music filled the air for our dining pleasure."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie..their biscuits can be pretty good.  Their chicken is ok.
A bit of a dearth for fried chicken downtown. 
This location itself is less than appetizing, but in general, when that one a year craving hits- it's convenient."}
{"text":"I enjoy Popeye's, most times.  This visit, I'd swear there were only idiots working there.  My chicken tasted and seemed old (not fresh)."}
{"text":"Less than 1 star. Costumer service sucked, the kid working was laughing for no reason at all. The restaurant was dirty and they didn't have any sauces or were not able to make French fries. The workers were sitting in the back on their phone while the trash cans were overflowing and the tables were dirty, will never go to this Popeyes again."}
{"text":"My friend ivan works here and he is incredible he always has such good manners and always gets me my food right on and on time absolutely the best service I gotten thanks to my friend Ivan and the chicken is good I well be going back awesome employee you guys have there"}
{"text":"There are not many of this chain restaurant and none near me. So when I have an errand at a nearby store to run for work I always go through the drivethru of this Popeye's. Never anything special service-wise but today was horrible. First, it smelled like sewage behind the building in the drivethru line. Then I'm literally mid-sentence ordering my food when the guy on the speaker in a very rude tone says, \"hold for a moment.\" Then nothing else. After probably 30-45 seconds, a girl gets on the speaker and says, \"So you were ordering... wait... can you start your order again.\" The guy had asked if I wanted regular or spicy popcorn shrimp. I'd never been asked that but said spicy. So I told the girl \"the popcorn shrimp combo, spicy.\" She says, \"It only comes one way.\" I said, \"ok, then however it comes is fine. Is diet Coke the only diet soda you carry?\" She says, \"Yes unless you want unsweet tea.\" I said, \"no, then diet Coke please.\" I complete my order and drive up to the window. I don't notice until I've pulled away that they've given me non sweetened tea, no Cajun dipping sauce for my shrimp, no butter & honey for my biscuit and no utensils with which to eat my mashed potatoes.  I won't be so excited next time I have to run an errand to this nearby store."}
{"text":"When Tues comes around, it's time to get my fatty on! $1.29 for a leg and thigh every Tues. Whoo hoo!

The chicken is always hot and fresh, and very juicy, plus it comes out fast. The staff never gave me attitude, and usually even smile. Want extra dipping sauce? No problem.

They even renovated recently, so it's very nice and modern looking in there."}
{"text":"Huge and utter disappointment. Food was prepared like shit and on top of that, they completely messed up our order after it was repeated 3 times... will not be going back to this Popeyes..."}
{"text":"I came to this location with my 3 boys and everyone was pleasantly pleased! I would personally like to thank Fernando for being so accommodating and pleasant. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This address is wrong and the phone number just rings busy. You guys really need to update your information so people aren't driving around looking for a store that doesn't exist."}
{"text":"First we pull up behind this gas station to get some chicken , nobody was behind us but the people inside kept rushing us. 

Later they explained that they were rushing us because they are being timed...how is that my fault??? They gave us regular chicken instead of the tenders which they offered to switch if we came inside. Wtf we were in a hurry so we said no. When we got home we realized they only gave us 3biscuits not the four which come with the 8piece. 

The guys were nice enough but the timed policy is b.s. and thas y our whole order was crapped"}
{"text":"My first and last visit to Popeye's, at least this location. Service was horrible, food was horrible, clientele was questionable, no reason at all to go back. The staff was very rude, the chicken, was skin-n-bones, no meat at all, and half my meal was missing. I question if I was served breaded bones. Luckily I dined in, so I could get the rest of my meal during the same visit. They gave me an extra Apple pie, so theres that, they actually gave me something extra for having a horrible experience, but thats too little too late."}
{"text":"Living nearby, we always see a long line in the drive thru every day! Assumed the food must be pretty good until reading the reviews...just really SLOW in the drive thru! Thank you, Yelpers, for preventing a dinner disaster!"}
{"text":"Does anybody manage these joints after they get them open?  Horrible attention to getting orders correct, or even caring about putting out a quality product, which is really sad because this could be the best fast food chicken & sides.  I hit the drive thru a couple of days ago for the surf and turf meal ($6.49)  Should come with 4 butterfly shrimp, 2 chicken tenders, biscuit, drink, and a side. 

What I received was 3 popcorn shrimp, 1 fresh, but spicy, chicken tender, one old leathery mild tender from a week ago, mashed potatoes and gravy that were put in the box on their side so the gravy leaked all over the rest of the food.  No napkin.  No spork.  When I asked the girl at the window for some cocktail sauce I got the deer in the headlights look and then she grabbed one to hand to me.  

Once I saw inside the restaurant I understood completely.  There was a tall, very good-looking young man at work.  His 2 female coworkers were staring at him like he was a side of beef.  Oh good Lord.  

Horrible experience.  I hope staring at Mr. Handsome was worth it ladies.  Who cares?  You're getting paid, right?"}
{"text":"Since about mid-October I've been totally abusing my body with sugar and grease.  This has got to stop.  I feel like a slug.  

I had those exact thoughts as I was sitting in my car yesterday after picking up some food through the Popeyes drive-thru, artfully arranging the items for photos.  Well, eating healthier starts today.  Or, maybe after the New Year's holiday.  

I had never had Popeyes up until a few months ago and now I have the dilemma of really liking it.  Their food flat out puts the colonel to shame.  No need to ever eat at KFC again.  And I would say it's better than Church's, although I do love Church's biscuits.  

Popeyes chicken can be ordered either mild or spicy and the 4 times I've had it, it has been delicious and not greasy at all.  I really dig the red beans & rice and the mac and cheese.  The only complaint I have is that 3 out of the 4 times I've been I've gotten white meat when I ordered dark.  Finally yesterday I got 2 pieces of dark meat.  Thank you.  It was excellent.  

I did manage to bring half of it home for my husband to try because he had never eaten at Popeyes either.  Now I have a partner in crime when we want to go out for fast food fried chicken.  Usually I have a bit of a drive to get to one, so that has slowed me down from eating there more often, but they are building a new one on Alma School, just north of Queen Creek Road.  That is very close.  

I don't want to be one of those clowns always talking about New Year's resolutions, so eating healthier can start in February.  I do have a vacation coming up."}
{"text":"I love fried chicken. I probably only visit Popeye's once a year, but every time I do, I order the biggest bucket and smell like fried chicken for the rest of the week. 

My brother-in-law is coming to visit us from Spain and he specifically requests Popeye's. So consider ourselves lucky, for having a fried chicken heaven on earth."}
{"text":"Was looking for a Popeye's close to home and this was it, not so close lol.  But, hey, we wanted some Popeye's Chicken.  It's not in the best neighborhood, not their fault.  We went inside to order a take-out just because I wanted to see the inside.  It was clean and immediately we were welcomed by the staff with a hearty hello and big smiles.  The cashier was very helpful.   There was nobody else there at about 2:30 PM on Thursday.  They completed our order efficiently and offered the sauces which I never even thought about.  They gave us a lot of different sauces.  My son started eating the fries on the way home and he said they were the best!  Overall a great experience and great tasting food!  We will go back just not too often cause this stuff will kill ya, lol."}
{"text":"Came to fill gas before heading back to return the rental car, this Popeyes was connected to the gas station.  I spotted their advertisement for Tuesday special - \"2 pieces of chicken for $1.29\" WHAT!  Thats so awesome!

i of course got 2 of the specials for the plane ride back!  Heck yeah 4 pieces of tasty fried chicken for less than $3 rather than a $8 tiny sandwich from the airport!  If i lived here id get a few of these deals every tuesday and have some for lunch every Wednesday too.

4 Value stars!"}
{"text":"Over a 20 min wait for Popeyes. First time here, It's not worth the wait for fast food. I ordered the spicy chicken and it was so bland. The drive through smelled like a port-o potty, Never coming back."}
{"text":"Menu selections at this location are more for lunch then for a family take away. We tried to order just tenders (not meals), mixed mild & hot, just like we do at a good many Popeye's across Ontario and the clerk/cashier said only from the menu please, so we broke down cause we were hungry got meals, and had to wait a good 25 minutes before we finally got it, we tried complaining but only got a sorry, no emotion, nothing else said. This is the last time for this location, but many other Popeye's are better and more obliging."}
{"text":"A newer Popeye's chicken location so a cleaner store is a given. Service is surprisingly quick during lunch hours and friendly for a fast food. I always think to myself that I should rate fast foods before I eat it, because by the time I'm done, I feel so gross with myself. Popeye's has been a thing for me ever since high school. They don't have Toonie Tuesdays, but they used to have Cajun rice which is now no longer on the menu hence only 3 stars. If you aren't into feeling so gross with yourself order the chicken nuggets. The chicken is nice and plumped for nuggets, and doesn't taste as over processed like McDonalds. Opt for sweet chilli heat sauce, you wont regret it (: I don't recommend the corn, its really 'soggy' and not fresh tasting at all."}
{"text":"I walked in and placed my order and when ahead and sat down & WOW this place is disgusting! The tables (IM TALKING ABOUT ALL) weren't wiped down, very sticky and dirty. The floors were cover in paper, chicken flakes, trash and it didn't take a minute to get up and ask for my money back. The manager asked me why and I said \"Would you eat at a place where it hasn't been cleaned and wiped down?\" She said \"No\". Well that is why i wont be eating here!"}
{"text":"It's fine. It's a Popeyes. A franchise fried-chicken restaurant, like KFC. 

Some people like Popeyes better than KFC, other people like KFC better. Most people like home-made fried chicken better, but most people don't get the option for home-made fried chicken very often. They have biscuits (yay!) and other side dishes.

It's not particularly healthy food, but if you like fried chicken, this place is a reasonable place to get it. It's busy at lunchtime, but the lines move reasonably well anyway. Service has been fine for me, although service at franchised fast-food restaurants isn't usually great."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worse time here all due to one person. I think she is the manager  and her name was Kly. She told me my order would take 15 mins because they ran out of mild and asked if I would be fine to wait. I told here ok I would wait, but after 20 mins I went up to the counter and asked how much longer. She says another 15 mins. I would have waited if she had just apologize but instead fave me attitude, walked away without saying a single word and made me wait another 5 mins before she came back and did the refund. I can't believe I was treated like this. Like I did something wrong. Horrible service and I will make it my mission to never come back to this place nor let anyone I know go to this place. I am blaming the staff there, but if Kly is still there I will not be giving them my money. And you bet I will contact the corporate office and let them know how they are treating their customer. 
Hhahaha and for this they want 15.00 and hour! Give me a break!"}
{"text":"Im addicted to popeyes chicken and this one is the closest to newmarket. So worth the drive. Crunchy delicious and great price. Waaaay better then KFC!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Horrible customer service quick to take your money! They said 8 min I'm waiting 15 min later I go inside to see where my food is and they said sorry another 8 min. Really?!?? My office will never get Popeyes again and to top it off gave us a hard time to refund us!! Never again"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. I was craving Popeyes today and I happened to be in Vegas visiting. We went off the strip to this location hoping for some good ol Popeyes. I was very disappointed. First of all the cashier couldn't speak english but that really wasn't the problem. The chicken was very dry. It taste like it had been cooked in week old oil. The mashed potatoes did not have enough gravy and the sandwich was sloppily put together. They didn't even give me a napkin or fork when i was clearly eating in. I went back to ask for sauce and they wanted to charge a quarter per packet! Out of all the popeyes Ive eaten at Ive never had to pay for sauce and it wasnt even like I already had sauce and wanted extra. If I could give this place a 0 i would."}
{"text":"Always fast, hot, and fresh when I come to this location. This is one of the newer Popeyes in the Phoenix Metro area. The customer service is always great and they have yet to get my order wrong. Sometimes they'll even throw in an extra strip at no additional charge. I know its fast food but I'm rating it soley based on other locations and similar establishments (i.e. KFC and Churchs). Popeyes is hands down #1 out of those three."}
{"text":"Great employees and good food!, very fresh!! Thank you to the wonderful employees here!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fast drive through place that will get your order right, put some condiments in your bag, then THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU!!!!!! Ordered spicy chicken meal and got regular chicken, ordered seafood platter and no tartar sauce or cocktail sauce for the shrimp and fish! Heck I'll even pay extra for sauce! Employees seemed lazy and inattentive, manager on duty was the one doing everything while his employees stood around doing nothing, and they want an increase on minimum wage?! I will never visit this location and will drive to the next Popeyes, or better yet never set foot in a Popeyes restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Tray was dirty.  Cleanliness isn't something they specialize in here.  Chicken pieces keep getting smaller and more expensive.  Albertsons has better chicken.  Sides are good here"}
{"text":"Literally the worst service here thanks to the General manager I'm sure,  i think her name is Faye. She gave me a 10 minute lecture in drive thru about how her food cost is more important than her customers and how the customers are not always right just because i asked for extra ranch.  All you have to do is push the ranch button a couple times or charge for it? Once i was told i could get more ranch if i ordered more chicken? Are you kidding me? The service is crappy, no one smiles and my order is wrong 9 times out of 10. This is the only Popeyes near me so i keep going back. I called corperate 3 times and no response! Who runs this company?  Today i ordered a 5 piece strips and 8 piece chicken and had to beg for 2 extra ranch and the girl gave me 10 honey and jelly? For what? I didn't even have bisquits!! Smh the cashiers don't even check whats in the bag most of the time and the cooks put your sauce in box with the chicken. That can't be policy to get nasty warm ranch with your strips? Well I'm done! Hopefully the Owner reads all these complaints and eventually does something!."}
{"text":"I've never been to a popeyes before in my life and I stopped here on the weekends for lunch, it was relatively empty which I was surprised about...the food was amazing! I loved the biscuit very different than kfc...I went through the drive thru,had no problems with sauces, in fact they were very patient and I had no problems...loved the food, loved the service. will definitely be back!
UPDATE: I went back Today and it was pretty busy and they messed up the sauces orders and I think they charge extra for the second sauce, they forgot 1 of my sides too and the manager was unapologetic thinking I was just stealing food,poor experience...so moral of the story when it's busy they mess up but when it's slow they get it right but bottomline the manager is a twat!"}
{"text":"Came in around 10:30 PM.

Ordered an 8-pc chicken-only family meal. We were told there would be a 15-min wait while they fry up a new batch and confirmed our order.

Sat around at a large table, and then our number was called.
It's basically 4 pairs of drumsticks + thighs, but the size was not too bad. Since it was just heated up, it was very crispy.

Satisfying."}
{"text":"Ordered fish sandwich was given a shrimp sandwich sides were just okay also got chicken and it was undercooked bloody al bone might try again but was disappointed hope it improves cause the KFC in the Fry's center on Bell and Reem's is awful"}
{"text":"First time here for this new location. Place was pretty busy on a Saturday night. Went in, ordered food to go. Had to wait about 10-15 minutes for my order. All I ordered was a three-piece chicken tender combo. They had no mild tenders ready. Food was mediocre but at least the tenders were cooked well, which is more than I can say for the Popeye's I ate at in Salina, KS. Tenders were kind of small too. If there were a Chester's Chicken closer than Buckeye, AZ, I would go there instead."}
{"text":"NO! No! NO!. while i LOVE popeyes and everything this fried chicken chain stands for, i DO NOT like this particular chain, which leaves me in a bind because the next closest one is all the way in North Olmsted.

The drive-thru clerk every time i get here is SLOW and screwed up my order the last two times i came. I order spicy and i get regular, not that its a big deal chicken is chicken but it pisses me off when im really craving spice.

The parking lot is full of pot holes, and the design is poor. The inside of the restaurant is dirty and dingy, keeps in with the part of cleveland this is in.

If you can avoid THIS specific popeyes do it at all costs, which is hypocritical of me based on my 5 check ins LOL. iim a sucker for some fried chicken. *facepalm*"}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely terrible. It almost makes me upset because these workers have no sense of urgency. They also keep messing up the orders and make people go back in to correct their issues. This african american kid keeps saying \"my bad or my fault\" because he cannot get his order together. Ive seen him more than once. He needs to get it together. This location has the modt unprofessional staff. They need professional people who can operate a business."}
{"text":"The place was clean and the employees were nice but incompetent . The food was very skimpy from the sides, chicken tender pieces, and even the sauces. They even forgot to give me my biscuit. Horrible place."}
{"text":"This location was visited on 4 prior occasions. The portion control was out of control. I thought it was eating pigeon. My order was for 4 pieces and an extra Mac & cheese. I left hungry! The portions shrunk so they are much smaller than my prior visits. The accountants took charge and did not consider the customer. It is only 4 pieces, Mac & cheese.  A huge chicken in Costco sells for $4.99. I will not be back. Robb461"}
{"text":"Worst Popeye's in the world i have had trouble wit this place on a number of occasions but this last time i go, the sign says drive thru closes at 11 pm I come at 10pm and they closed a hour early..this is the closest Popeye's to me and they suck just my luck!"}
{"text":"This is twice now that I've asked for spicy and got regular. The To Go box wasn't a box, it was that half carton thing put into a bag sideways then handed to me with the bag straight up causing all the food to fall out. The food seemed like it had been sitting out since it wasn't fresh hot. I love Popeye's don't get me wrong, but I'm going to have to find another venue to go to. Step it up!"}
{"text":"We came to this Popeyes location on a Thursday around 4pm. We ordered 2 chicken wraps, a side of cajun rice, and a side of macaroni and cheese. These should be common items at the restaurant. 

While ordering, we heard the drive thru person taking our order as well as another person who clearly either seemed to be training the other or simply wanted to add commentary. For example, when my boyfriend stated that we wanted a large side of macaroni and cheese, we heard the other voice say \"Of course\" in a catty, careless way. My boyfriend didn't care, but I feel that the tone was unprofessional and bordered discrimination. Is it because of the way we look? We're not sticks, but we're not severely overweight. I was personally offended by these random comments. 

When we got to the window, we were told that we had to pull up next to the trash can and wait. The trash can is still within the drive thru line and, by listening to what the employee said, we briefly held up the line.  

After waiting for 5 minutes, we moved to the other side of the building. When I went back inside, I explained what had happened to the employee, a young girl at the cashier. She said nothing to me and brought her shift lead over. I explained the issue and she said, \"Oh, so you just haven't gotten your food.\" Meanwhile, I saw 2 cars pass through the drive thru with food in hand. I noticed that our food wasn't even prepared yet. 

While I waited, the young female employee and a young male employee stood in front of me, looking at me, giggling. Completely unprofessional. 

The shift lead finally brought me the food 3 minutes later. No utensils, no napkins. I normally let these things slide, but the service we received and the lack of accountability among the employees was atrocious. It honestly appeared that the shift lead couldn't care less about her employees' work. I don't think I'll be getting food from here again any time soon."}
{"text":"Worst location , only order from the drive thru , check your order , 75% of the time they are  wrong . 10 people working and the people cooking are not qualified to put chicken in boxes ( not allowed to help ). I'm almost 60 years old -- this is the only place in my life that I requested a refund ."}
{"text":"This has to be the worse Popeyes with employee training. I have been there 4 time in 30 days to get my workers lunch and all 4 times they have got my order wrong at the drive thru. Get some Mexicans to work there bc at least they can read the print out. Not trying to be racist but your black ladies working the drive thru are dumb as a box of rocks.."}
{"text":"So my friends and I came through the drive thru and after our order was taken, it felt like we waited ten more minutes til we actually got to the window. But that's not much of a complaint, like I understand what it's like to be short staffed and busy. My complaint is mainly toward the fact that the lady who was packing everything into boxes, she wasn't wearing any gloves. Did I mention she took our money too? Before and after putting our food together. I've been through ServSafe, and you're required to wear gloves when handling food. 

We also asked if we could have barbecue sauce for dip and ketchup, she said \"yeah, no problem\" and we didn't notice until we got home that she didn't put any sauce in our bag. It's no big deal, but it's still bothersome."}
{"text":"I love fried chicken! Maybe it's just because I'm from LA but I've always preferred Popeyes over KFC. 
This particular Popeyes never gets my order right. EVER. 

I guess I didn't learn my lesson since I still stopped by to pick up a 10-piece spicy chicken for some friends coming over for lunch. The deal came with 2 sides and biscuits. I ordered fries and mac & cheese. After sitting in the drive thru for 10 minutes, I finally get my food and drive home.

I open the bag to find that the lady gave me 3 boxes of biscuits. 
THREE. 
I DON'T EVEN LIKE THEIR BISCUITS.

I just sat there staring at these boxes of hard, bland biscuits in disbelief. 

My relationship with this Popeyes is just like that one T.Swift song, 
WE ARE NEVER EVER EVER GETTING BACK TOGETHER.
(Insert broken heart emoji here)"}
{"text":"Food is always good. No question. So, when the new beer battered chicken was showcased as the feature item, I made a special trip to try it. I was very disappointed to hear that they were all out. The server told me they were really good. I asked for a rain check. Whatever happened to rain checks? The girl just laughed and said 'no'. I was serious. Why not? It's the featured item. So bummed but I got the blackened chicken which was still good but I can't help but to wonder what the beer battered tasted like. Ugh... Do I have to go back again to try it? Sad face."}
{"text":"To expensive and the chicken is always dry. I actually can not believe they get enough business to stay open. It is across from my work and we have all tried it and all agreed it is no good."}
{"text":"I was going to cook at home but my meat did not unthaw and it was already approaching dinner hours. So I told my son lets just grab some Popeyes and call it a night. Soon as we arrived and got out of the car, the smell of good chicken was in the air before even entering the restaurant. I just knew we was in for a good meal. NOT!!!! I walked in and saw the cook in the back dropping fresh chicken and thought \"Yes, just in time for the good stuff\". We ordered and waited about 15 minutes and was served. Something told me to check my food, but I did not listen to that silent voice. I trusted the food was ok and in tact because I thought I was getting freshly dropped chicken. When I got home and opened the box of 8 pieces of chicken, I immediately saw this was old chicken that has possibly been sitting on the burner for hours. It was dried up and turning a even darker shade of brown. I was soooo mad, I got back dressed and went to return this food even though I lives miles away. I was really mad that they had cooked fresh chicken in my face but put old meat in my to-go order. I guess they thought \"People ordering to go will take anything and don't check their orders\". They were right, I failed to check mine before leaving and will never do that again. 

In closing, I noticed there was a lot of new workers in there. I frequent this place every now and then. The manager was nice enough to get me what she said was fresh chicken. It looked overcooked and I have a strong feeling they are not changing out that cooking grease often."}
{"text":"I go to this location at least 2 times a week because I work in walking distance and don't always have a choice. they have great food, but the customer service on the night shift is a joke. the day shift is on point and the manager is great. At night they let you sit at the register for 10 minutes sometimes before even acknowledging you, then they are always out of everything or have to make it and you have to wait. the last time I went in they did not even for warn me of the wait and 10 minutes later I am still waiting and they tell me it will be another 2! I would have never waited that long at a fast food place if I had been for warned as they usually do.  I asked to speak to a manger and the guy said nothing to her. I asked him again and he shouted at me that she was busy?? She finally walked over and could care less."}
{"text":"Ordered an 8 piece but received no plates to eat on. It should have been a no-brainer. There was also a worker on break sitting right next to a dirty table (the only one available)...she noticed us, but couldn't be bothered to get off her phone to wipe down a table for 30 seconds.

Only redeeming thing about this place is that the service was quick & the chicken was fresh."}
{"text":"What is the point of a fast food joint having a website that does not include prices?
 Oh, I know...that way you don't realize what a rip-off it is, until it's too late.
 This chicken is perfectly fine, but they are expecting you to pay restaurant prices for fast food. I
would never, ever eat there again, unless I was in the States where the cost is not as absurd."}
{"text":"This is my local Popeye's and they satisfy my Popeye's obsession time and time again BUT, once I tried Popeye's from another franchisee my eyes were opened! This location is slow and their chicken, as mentioned by other reviewers, is terribly greasy. So greasy, in fact, that I only order tenders from this location.

They also nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING. It is extremely annoying that they can't just give you an extra sauce. And even if it is a presumably free item, you still have to ask for it. 

I will continue to go here because it is close to my place but if I ever have the opportunity to go to another location I will."}
{"text":"The food at Popeyes is always great - Thank goodness for corporate recipes. The service here is atrocious. The cashier was very disrespectful, and rude."}
{"text":"Food was fine, but we ordered a special they had posted and they charged full price. When we asked about price, they just said \"oh, we're not doing that anymore.\" Didn't apologize or offer refund."}
{"text":"worst Popeyes I've ever been to--if I wasn't a huge fan before I'd never come back because of this place.  

extremely rude workers who don't know how to manage their time and serve customers effectively. 

food is never fresh here either."}
{"text":"Always get my order wrong. Processed small strips are what they call the tenders.... Its been over 4 times my order has been wrong and have learned my lesson that this location isn't the one. Also you'd assume people want at least one butter and or honey for their biscuit"}
{"text":"Popeyes chicken is the best. And the dining room & drive -thru proves that..busy busy!! But Dijon at the register keeps a smile thru it all."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh and friendly service. Food location for the best fast food fried chicken on the planet."}
{"text":"Walked in 30 minutes after they opened and ordered chicken strips and fries.

Chicken tasted old and the fries were cold to the touch.

Everything should be fresh 30 minutes after you open.

We won't be back."}
{"text":"How can this business stay open when its workers can't even count to ten.  Ordered 5 - 2 piece chicken dinners and got 9 (nine) pieces.  There large mash potato and cold slaw cups look like the small version.  Really over charged us on our order.  Not likely to go back here anytime soon.  People stay away from this place, they will geep you to the max.  Workers sho can't count need to go back to school big time just like KFC workers.  Had the same problem there last year.  Haven't been back anytime soon.
Called them 9 times and no one answered the phone.  Bad customer service."}
{"text":"I was excited to see that they are going to open a new Popeyes but it only takes one time to ruin me from going back there ever. The reason I gave them a one star is because they have their own way of running their store. I asked if they have the TUESDAY SPECIAL and they said they don't, so I asked why not and they basically told me they just don't. I told them that if they were on the strip of Vegas I would understand that, because most most places they wouldn't have the special but they are off the strip. 

If you want to get the TUESDAY SPECIAL go to the one between Maryland Pkwy and Tropicana Ave. That Popeyes at least understand how to run their store and how it's suppose to be by the book and the rules.   Even though that other Popeyes is very busy they have good customer service not like this new place I drove by next to 99 cent store and will never go to that one. 

This Popeyes I bet don't even care. With this type of reviews his business location will not survive. Not so good luck to you so far.  I'm gonna make sure everyone in my twitters and Facebook peps will be notified."}
{"text":"Standard Popeyes fare. Slowest and worst service ever. Can they work any slower? Order of two pieces of chicken took 10 minutes and I was next in line. No sense of pride in their work. Ironically I come here when I want something fast."}
{"text":"Every person here needs to be let go. Absolutely unacceptable service. DO NOT WASTE MONEY HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Very clean and nice location! Cashier is very helpful and attentive. Will definitely go back here."}
{"text":"This is the worst..All Popeyes makes me sick..last time I got chicken tenders. It tasted bad..not real chicken..I just went to get the biscuits and apple pie..the place looked dirty. The guy told me pies will take 7 mins...the biscuits were hard and pop machine empty..please bring back Wendys..."}
{"text":"Worse service EVER!!! Who ever is running your drive thru is a horrible person and does not care about her job. It should not take 5 min to wait to order as I am in front of the speaker. And then for us to wait twenty minutes stuck in your line!!"}
{"text":"What a joke. First time visit.  No one working there had a clue. Tried to order 3 piece strip but they were out etc etc etc. guess that is what I get trying to order dinner from kids"}
{"text":"Busy location but the service is quick and they are organized.  I love their fried chicken.  It's way better than KFC, seriously!  Tried Mac and cheese side which was not so good.  Stick to their light crispy biscuits and fries.  Ever since the Popeyes on Dundas by Winston Churchill became Dave's chicken, it's not so good and I have to drive farther east to get my fried chicken fix."}
{"text":"Not bad, the spicy chicken sandwich is actually spicy. 

The wait when I went was pretty long. The place was pretty clean and service was quite friendly.

There's a TV showing CP24 which is good if you're waiting."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviews .... the chicken is delicious but my two star review is  for the restaurant itself. No honey, no hot sauce and had to wait 17 minutes for my order. 
The staff all seem frustrated as was all of us in line waiting. 
Seems like management is lacking . 
The chicken tho ..   it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here the other night for dinner and the lady was kind enough to not only give us fresh shrimp but free drinks while we waited for our fresh shrimp. Like this location"}
{"text":"Worst customer service an employee standing around thumb up his butt four people in line and can not get waited on GO SOMEWHERE ELSE"}
{"text":"Never get orders right. Check before you leave! Asked for tenders got chicken. 2nd visit ordered large frys and a combo with frys. Didn't get any frys. This place is horrible"}
{"text":"It was first visit to this location.. The drive thru clerk was very dry... So I decided to go inside to place my order. The cashier was very bland wasn't knowledgeable about the products sold barely knew what type of fish that was sold. After placing our order we noticed that the dining area was very unclean almost every table was dirty, the drink station was filthy. There was something hanging in the fixture after notifying the cashier he removed the item. He didnt wash his hands at all before returning back to work (with food). Not to mention getting back to the office noticing there was few fries in my personal box and my employee had no fries. The food was soggy and cold."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. The server at the counter sneezed into her hand and I asked if she wanted to wash her hands and she said nope I'm okay. I said really you should wash your hands and she did - with soap and water. Chicken tenders were okay but half was batter. Sides were absolutely disgusting- coleslaw that was like tapioca gone bad, and mashed potatoes that were like gravy potato soup. Revolting! Go to Nandos across the street for much higher quality and cheaper"}
{"text":"Jus had the worst experience. First of all, I left the restaurant thinking I had everything because it's there job to take people's orders. I mean you work here because you should be able to perform to the standard required like completing an order. Another thing is the guys in front(within the hour of 5pm today) \"taking care\" of the people walking in for orders were entirely, as a crew, inefficient. Tylor/Taylor talked too much in front of customers. He even asked a customer to write down what she wanted because he could understand the acronym his job uses. I mean seriously? You work here right? Milo seemed lost and was very quiet. Even when calling orders I could barely hear him, and I was literally the first person on the other counter. On top of that he got my order wrong. Missing 2 pieces of chicken from my order and a whole box of 12 biscuits which I paid for. It's honestly not the food but the incompetence of doing uiur job. Any job, no matter what you do, should be taking seriously. I can't even go on any more about how bad it was. Oh btw it took nearly 15 minutes in line, then another 345 minutes waiting for my order of 12 Tuesday specials, and 2 orders of 12 biscuits order"}
{"text":"Food is good but service is extremely slow. If you want halfway decent service then you have to go inside. Once inside I noticed that eirther there is wayyyy to much chicken sitting under the lamps or none at all. If there is none, then you should just turn around and drive to another location because you will be there forever...10min to get your order correct, 5 minutes to let cook know to fry more chicken, 5 minutes for him to actually fry it, 10 more minutes to confused your order and 5 more minutes for someone to bag it up...I did once get a free fountain drink for waiting 25 minutes...smh"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!!!  That is if you value your time.  30 minutes and they still haven't figured out how to put 8 pc of chicken in a box and hand it to me. After wasting my time looking at them fumble orders I decided to save them the brain melt of getting me 8pc of chicken and asked for a refund, but wait 5min later cashier can't count, I have to give them back my change so that I can get a refund...oh yeah, they are trying to get $15/hr, only in America..."}
{"text":"Best chicken ever. They recently remodeled, my favorite thing is the chicken tenders. Best drive through chicken hands down."}
{"text":"**in short: worst service in the history of EVER.** if you wanna know why, read on---- When we are toddlers, adults teach us how to match. (put the square in the square hole, the triangle with the triangle,circle with the circle etc.) Matching is something monkeys can do but apparently the staff at popeyes cannot. I ordered a number 5 with 2 extra biscuits. i get my food without my biscuits, no sauce and no drink. I then stood there being ignored by the manager and 4 other employees when attempting to ask for the things i had paid for and after finally being acknowledged the man tells me, 'sorry,that guys order was wrong and he was being an asshole.'' to which I though, ''wow you just told me someone was an asshole, AND YOU GOT HIS ORDER WRONG TOO?!\" but i didnt say anything, i just asked for honey and a ranch to which he gives me 1 honey for 3 biscuits and tells me the ranch is .30 EVEN THOUGH THE MENU SAYS MY 'DIPPIN CHICKEN' COMES WITH A DIP! now i am irritated and say ''may i have more honey or should i ask everyone to share 1 honey?'' and then the manager comes over and gives me 2 more, and a ranch but does not apologize for messing my order up. i sit down to eat and it is hot as hell in there, and in the 15 minutes we were there SIX PEOPLE came in with messed up orders!! (and of course the staff was RUDE!) then as i was cleaning up my things to leave, a man walks in and i say, ''if you eat here prepare to have your order butchered. apparently these people dont know how to read and put what you ask for in a bag.\" to which he responds, '' haha no, i am sure it will be fine...i am only getting a 3 piece and a drink.\" then i sit down to watch him order because by now its entertaining how stupid these people are, he gets his food, checks it, looks over at me with shame and says, ''excuse me guys...you forgot my breast...oh and i asked for 2thighs, this is 2 drums...'' YEAH. PATHETIC. and to think, people like this want 15$ an hour...they should be grateful they arent just getting tips cause they would be REALLY broke!"}
{"text":"For the life of me I can not figure out why we STILL continue giving this location the benefit of the doubt. There has not been a single time, and I'm not exaggerating at all, that we have visited this drive through and had our order correct. When we started coming here a few years back we would simply drive all the way home before opening the sack to major disappointment. We would call and sometimes go back, sometimes be told we could come back the next day. We didn't go that often, too much of a hassle, but the kids can easily be fed chicken legs without complaints and in terms of distance KFC is just as far. When you don't have the energy to cook I prefer the mashed potatoes at Popeyes or else it would never even come up. After a number of visits and complaints you expect a change to be made, perhaps training, and so personally I still didn't check the order before leaving if I was driving. I expect it to be correct! My wife began checking before leaving the parking lot but I'm usually driving. There were even times I would opt to eat in simply to save myself the frustration of dealing with it at all. Here's the thing: you check your order but you don't do it at the window because you try to be polite and get out of the way of those behind you. No matter what the order is incorrect and you HAVE TO PARK AND GO INSIDE! It makes me angry so I have said that we should just go inside anyway to save time since we'll be in there regardless. Sometimes you aren't dressed for that though and so lately we make s habit of just checking, no matter what, before leaving the parking lot. I almost lost it today! Once again there was missing food from my order. Mind you at this point I have s helmet on my head because I'm missing part of my skull which gets uncomfortably hot and I wasn't really dressed to walk inside but at least I had shoes on which my wife did not. So I got to go inside and retrieve the missing chicken. Every time! It's not as though you can even have s pleasant experience while ordering because something is wrong wth the intercom system and you find yourself repeating your order multiple times, with no visual confirmation. Sigh. Like I said, if my children, and really it is just the six year old at this point the older one is easier, weren't so damn picky we'd have more options. The worst part about today? IT WAS THE MANAGER WHO SAW ME COME INSIDE FOR MY MISSING PIECES! When I mentioned to her the frequency of the problem she simply said \"Oh yeah\" AS IF IT WERE NORMAL TO GIVE PEOPLE WRONG ORDERS! I never check my bag at chick fil a, thankfully that's open close enough that I never have to visit this Popeyes any longer. Today just happened to be Sunday, only reason I went. No more, not doing it."}
{"text":"I like popeye's but they can be a kind of hit and miss sometimes. This place can get pretty busy so go during non peak hours."}
{"text":"As a rule, don't be in a hurry when you come to this Popeyes. If they Park you in front to wait for an order in drive through, they might forget all about you- leaving you parked and waiting. 

That said, I have never received old, cold or stale food there. It's always been hot and fresh- and generally they are always friendly!"}
{"text":"I always go to this Popeye's since its fairly close to where I live and the service has always been good. The food is good, service was fast and they never messed up on my order. I've eaten inside once and it was nice, quiet and clean. I don't have an issue but I would change the time they open because 10am is far too late even if they don't offer breakfast."}
{"text":"Eating at popeyes is what happens when your cube neighbor says hey chicken would be great for dinner.  
Sigh I really should have done to one of the better chicken places within a couple miles away. 
I've eaten here a couple times and this is the first time they actually had dark meat.  While I'm not basing my review on that just giving you a warning they sometimes have issues preparing the food.  
The main reason for the low score is one of the drunksticks was nasty.  As in one bite and done.  If it was my first piece I would have thrown the entire thing in the trash.

If you want a good idea of the quality just search for popeyes and you'll see many of the resturants have a low raiting.  While people may have different reason for their low scores I think the common low scores might mean something.

I don't think I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Taylor was takin' the orders and fillin' 'em as quick as possible.  

I stopped on a Friday morning looking for a small something to eat while I traveled along the Ohio Turnpike.  A little something turned out to be a 3 piece meal of spicy chicken, with red beans and rice, and a biscuit. Whew - more than I wanted, but good to the last bite.

I recommend!"}
{"text":"5-star rating (for its particular target category and market) earned by this particular Popeyes because .....Mikeya and her colleagues were patient with me as I told them my special diet needs (I'm doing low carb)

That means a lot.  Way to go.  Pope YES CHICKEN, the official chicken of the Vatican!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice so far, and I am consistent entertained by the customers that wait in line.  I truly feel sorry for the staff that works here, as the clients here are the worst I've ever seen.

The ghetto people that hold up the line complaining about their chicken (when there shouldn't be a problem to begin with) are mind bogglingly tacky;

* Lady holds up the line of 20 people because she said she \"called and axed [sic] where the place was and the man said it was down the street, and I walked for 3 miles...\"

Then she DEMANDS A TAXI!

Like...

O____O

What??

I'll finish this review when I have more time, but I just wanted to mitigate some of the abuse that Kyle and his all-female staff have had hurled at them by the general public.

They deserve a break.  I'll add a star when I get appropriate condiments next time (read: tartar sauce)"}
{"text":"I don't expect a 5 star experience when I go to a fast food place but the last 2 times I've ordered here it's anything but fast, or accurate. The staff is pleasant but never seems to be able to handle a crowd above 2 or 3 people."}
{"text":"I am currently waiting for no over 25 minutes still without my  foodAnd i want to c how long they will keep me waiting 949 manager comes out and he did apologize and made it right"}
{"text":"Admittedly, I like Popeyes! And yes, I am a Fan!

Whether its this one, or the one in Blythe coming back from California, it's a real treat to pick up some NOLA inspired food.  Their Cajun Gravy is to die for! Really.

Stopped in today to catch up with Scott D. We have been checking into businesses on Yelp together for over four years. Long time! It's been a fun four years and nice to kick back with a friend who also loves Popeyes!

I had a Po'Boy Chicken sandwich, which wasn't bad.  But I wouldn't insult any of my NOLA friends by calling it a true Po'Boy.  I also ordered three chicken strips and asked for a Cajun Gravy chaser.  LOL  It ran me just under $8.00, not a steal but a fair price. A better deal is what Scott ordered, their Tuesday Special of 2 pieces of chicken, biscuit and Pop for $2.99.  \"Love that Chicken at Popeyes!\"

Enjoy"}
{"text":"This place is almost always poorly run. It has to be the owner because the staff is always different. I guess it is on me, since I keep coming back and expecting different results. Today I am waiting 12 minutes for chicken, because they didn't have any mild ready. At 443 pm dinner time! All I can do for any satisfaction is complain on yelp and hope management pays attention. Now i just found out they forgot to drop the chicken. It seems there is a shift change, not sure who to be pissed at. Wow."}
{"text":"DON'T USE THE DRIVE THRU!!!

I placed my order, was treated lovely by the young ladies taking the orders/money.  I was told to pull ahead and wait while they made more chicken, I happily did so, as I noticed the three cars behind me also were asked to pull ahead.  Then the waiting happened....15 minutes went by and the other 3 cars were given their food, which all included large boxes of chicken, the same basic thing I had ordered.  The funny thing was, two of those orders were brought to my car first, and when the young lady asked me my order # I told and both times she responded, \"Oh, yours is coming out next.\" So I waited another 10 minutes, no other cars had to pull ahead, they all got their chicken as they were supposed to.  So I had to take my son out of his carseat, the reason I went through the drive-thru in the first place, and asked them where my order was.  A young man took my ticket, looked at it, looked at me, looked at his screen, and shrugged his shoulders.  Now, at this time I noticed that there entire front \"Chicken Warmer/Holding Tank\" was FULL of chicken.  I asked the same young man if he could just fill my order with the chicken that was right in front of him.  Apparantly, he had to go check with a manager, when he came back he asked me if I could wait so they could make my order fresh.  I said NO WAY, why would I want to wait EVEN LONGER?!?!?  So I asked for my money back, which he gladly did, but it did take another 5 minutes to finally get out of there and I went through the Wendy's drive thru next door and was in and out in 6 minutes."}
{"text":"Quick friendly service. Great food. No issues at all. Chicken was flavorfull, juicy and good. Sides were all top notch. Service was quick, friendly, and welcoming. 

From walking in to walking out with a 12 piece family dinner was less than 2 minutes. Can't beat that for quick good food."}
{"text":"I had a problem for the last week....I have a Coworker that's comes to the property at my job and last week she sent me to get another order the credit card number was wrong so the manager told that she couldn't get me another order so I left it was only right yesterday I went up there with my property manager and this time I had the receipt from the day before she came to the window and she told me that she wouldn't listen to me because I came before and it was a lie because of the previous time she took my receipt talked ugly to me and my property manager. So when my Coworker comes to the property I told her what happened we went back up there she came out and my Coworker told her what happened she didn't even once looked at me apologized or nothing but gave my Coworker money back...and I asked her for an I'm sorry or anything..Rox..that's her name no one should be treated like that at all..she should be fired or an I'm sorry...I work in customer service..Don't ever come to Popeye's on Dobson road in mesa..I was treated very badly..and rude!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I decided to come to this Popeyes establishment after five o'clock there's NEVER any spicy tenders. This has happen on multiple occasions and it's really getting annoying. I never had this issue with the Popeyes on thunderbird and 83rd ave. I gave you guys many opportunities again and again but because this has been a constant thing that's why I decided to write this review. I'm just very disappointed and you lost me as a customer. FYI my food isn't even warm nor hot. I don't feel appreciated so I will take my money else where."}
{"text":"Sad I would one star a Popeye's, but this one deserves it. Whether it'd be the employees at the cashier with their monotone / robotic lack of personalities (how come I'm the one saying \"Hi, how's it going?\") to the possible day old cajun fries that feel like rock hard diamonds when I'm taking a crapper. This particular Popeyes is in desperate need of restructuring from the ground up. Possibly the worst of all the ones I've ever visited and will most definitely be the last for this one. Probably check in a year or two to see if the cast of P. Diddy's making the band has been replaced so that the food over here can be cooked properly. (For the record, I gave them three visits for a fair chance....and those rock hard fries hurt every time)"}
{"text":"First time at this Popeye's. Arrived at 12:30 on a Thursday and there were 12 eating, eight in line, three cars at the drive thru and four waiting for their meal. The line moved very fast. 

The restaurant was clean and fairly cold. The music was so loud tho that no one could hear their name called. I ordered a three piece combo with chicken, a side and a drink for $8.64. Not a bad deal. 

Popeye's is good for a quick bite of chicken but with the limited menu, not a lot of choices."}
{"text":"This is the latest Popeye to pop up in the hood.  Great timing with KFC just around the corner so one can satisfy their chicken craving no matter what they want.

I prefer Popeye's over KFC.  The chicken is always juicy yet crispy and those biscuits.  Those biscuits!!!  And a great range of sides to boot!

Just go for it when the mood strikes.  And then eat salad for 2 weeks to compensate for the gluttony....

Only warning with this location is that twice they lost our order because one of us ordered chicken tenders vs the fried chicken so they have to cook that up special for us and that gets lost somehow!?!"}
{"text":"Poor service! I ask for bottle for water a she give me a cup! All orden is incorrect! I never come back"}
{"text":"Best popeyes in las vegas we only get 30 min for lunch, the service is fast, freindly always accurate, restaurant always clean, food hot and fresh everytjme"}
{"text":"Omg the people here are grown adults. How hard is it to prepare food correctly? The mac and cheese container was not filled, it looks gross. The chicken strips were more breading than chicken. The cashier hands me the wrong receipt. Then my food and says have a nice day. I looked at her and said I have 2 sodas. She goes oh.  What were they... Really if you cant handle the drive thru, get someone who can.."}
{"text":"How can u have no white meat on a Monday at 7p poor management of food ordering. They didn't even make an offer of compensation wanted to charge me almost $10 for a leg combo, no Popeyes today!!!!!"}
{"text":"They have good food but they need to work on cleaning the dining area. I literally seen a number a customers cleaning the tables off.  Also they have a fly problem. I just counted nine flys on a window and thats just one window. Good but dirty"}
{"text":"Very nice people, clean restaurant and the food is excellent. I ordered he shrimp poboy and the fries. Next time I want to try the catfish poboy and the red beans and rice and I will be bringing my family along to experience the deliciousness."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, they got the order right & even cleaned my table with a smile. Order two chicken mild raps with fries and a drink. The spices are also tasty on the fries. I would come back again and this had been my only ever positive experience at a Popeye's."}
{"text":"Went in for a two piece spicy combo. I  asked that one of the pieces be a breast. The lady behind the counter said there was an up charge for the breast. I told her I go to other Popeye's and there has never been an up charge for this combo meal. She said that the only choice at this location was a leg and a thigh for a two piece combo. I pointed out that the menu board clearly does not state this. I told the lady never mind, cancel the order and I won't be back to this location. When I got home I found a recent receipt from another location. Guess what, I had a 2 piece combo with a breast and no upcharge !!  Stay away from the Surprise Arizona location. They are greedy !!"}
{"text":"We came to Popeyes on opening week two years ago and like Scott D, we left very impressed by everything and everyone here. We found this location to be clean and first rate. 

Now here we are, two years later and not much has changed, which I believe is a good thing. Today we ordered two Five Piece Combos, which comes with a Buttery Biscuit, drink and any side for $7.99.

We also ordered some Popcorn Shrimp, which also comes with a Biscuit for $3.99. The meal was huge, fresh and tasty. See photos. Recently Popeyes has added all sorts of new dipping sauces, such as Pepper Ranch, Cajun Cocktail, Buffalo and more. 

Our tab, $19.41 after a Senior Discount. Yep, Georgie's getting old. Btw, on Tuesday's they have a Special - two Legs or Thighs for $1.69. 

So yes, Five Stars for a very delicious tasty meal. Now if they could only put the MSG back into the Cajun Sparkle.  Yowzer!"}
{"text":"Got carry out from this place tonight. If you want spicy breading with very little chicken in your chicken tenders, this is the place. Chicken, what there was of it was dry. My 5 piece tender combo had 1 of 5 tenders that was actually something you could call a chicken tender. Fries, paid for a large and got a small, were not hot or even warm. Only got 1 of 2 dipping sauces. The best part was the biscuit.....which was warm and fresh. Total with tax for two 5-piece tender combos was $22+. I hope you spend that money well, because you will not get any more of my money. Disappointing!!"}
{"text":"Slow service, really slow. Slug slow service. They don't give plates or forks. We had to keep going back and fourth, kinda annoying but the food is good at least heh...."}
{"text":"It's 10:45 and they have no chicken no nothing kitchen is closed ... hmm...  what's the whole point you guys close at 11 pm"}
{"text":"In what is one of the most confusing parking lots I've seen in Mississauga, this Popeye's is located not far from the north east intersection of Dixie and Eglinton.  When I say confusing I mean confusing if you're trying to go southbound on Dixie because there's no way to do it.  You're either exiting at the gas station at the Eglinton side near Mary Brown's or you're going northbound on Dixie as there's no exit that will allow you to legally turn left.

As far as Popeye's restaurants go this is one of the nicest looking Popeye's I've ever seen as far as cleanliness, decor, space and lighting.  The customer service is friendly and polite I have to say.  This time around we went with the family dinner which is 12 pieces, 2 large sides and half a dozen biscuits.  After tax it came out to just over 40 bucks.  Yes, Popeye's is more expensive here than in the US but that's a given.  I had asked if they had Cajun Sparkle at this location and they didn't know what I was talking about.  I guess that magic dust is only available in the USA?  I did get it once here in Burlington which is the only time I've ever had it outside the US while even some locations in the US don't always have it.

For the breakdown of the 12 pieces it was as follows:  4 thighs, 3 drumsticks, 3 breasts, 2 wings.  So basically that's 7 dark to 5 white meat ratio.  12 pieces is more than a whole chicken but less than 2 and I had asked before hand what the breakdown would be like and they said it would be about half/half which is about right.  I had also asked for about half/half original and spicy too.  In addition to being a lifelong fan of Popeye's, I believe many of the Popeye's establishments here are Halal certified as well.  

There used to be a Popeye's across the street but I'm not sure if this store moved here or if it's just an outright new place.  Either way it's nicer and newer but harder to egress out of to get back on Dixie southbound or Eglinton eastbound."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst location nationwide. They routinely run out of items on the menu. The food isn't as good as other locations. Service extremely slow-- to the point where you seriously contemplate getting back there and helping them out. Still I would go by because it's so close to the house. After their refusal of honoring an offer off of the Popeye's website specifically for this location, I'm done."}
{"text":"Only Place you can still get the Fried apple pie. Service is good never had any problems."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, both times they were very slow and messed my order up both times. Even when I went back to fix it, they still forgot two things.  The food was below average. Husband loves it but I will not be returning"}
{"text":"Not too happy with this location.  Went here for lunch this week and ordered the wicked combo meal and was asked to wait in front of the restaurant as it would take 3 minutes.  Well the 3 minutes turned into 15 minutes and so I didn't have time to eat it in my car and had to go right back to work,,,,Boo!"}
{"text":"Whoever owns this location needs to drug screen all its employees.  I was told by someone who works there that they are doing drugs in the bathroom.  Food was very slow to get, both soda machines had no ice in them.  When it first opened it was decent.  Now this place is so ghetto, and I bet the owner has no clue these things are going on right under his nose."}
{"text":"Service at this location was amazing! Went at 8:30 pm.. Manager was accommodating. Very nice and pleasant. Order was perfect.
Thank you! Will be back, even if it's a little out of my way.."}
{"text":"OK. So it seems stupid to write a review for Popeyes...BUT....in the past, in other states, this has been a tremendous restaurant in terms of delicious, fried, wanna-keep-shoveling-into-your-pie-hole-bad-for-you food. Every single Popeyes location I have been to in Vegas totally and I mean TOTALLY blows. There could be nobody in line or several....food is always dry, tastes old and just plain sucks. And I've tried everything so it's not like it's just the one item I get. You seem to wait a long time as well - no matter if you're the only one or there is 4 cars in front - never fast and never fresh. 

The kicker is that once again, EVERY location I have been to in Vegas has the rudest people of every single restaurant I have tried. Sure....every once in a while, I expect that. I'm sure I am cranky sometimes too and I deal with the public. But from start to finish, all of the employees at all of the locations seem terribly angry and it's clear that you and your hunger are a burden to them.

So, I would pass. For sure."}
{"text":"Popeye's makes some of the best chicken around.  The staff at this location is courteous and efficient.  We have had quality food the many times we've been here."}
{"text":"Not every Popeyes has breakfast anymore. Do yourself a favor and stop in to get a chicken biscuit. Between the crispy chicken and the buttery biscuit, it really is what Southern breakfast dreams are made of. There's no reason in the world why you shouldn't get breakfast if you're near the terminal (other than your cholesterol and caloric intake). Staff is efficient and friendly as well."}
{"text":"It took more than 15 minutes for our food to come out and we went through the drive threw! Horrible customer service too as they wouldn't even speak to us as we went inside! Will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"For a 'fast food' place it gets 3 stars.

Cleanliness = 3* Floors were dirty.
Customer service = 3* Nothing special.
Atmosphere = N/A
Food = 3* Chicken is a bit dry, biscuit is good, and nice selection of sauces.

Certainly not the worst place, and may be acceptable for a quick/cheap lunch if you're in the area. However, I wouldn't waste a family dinner here, stick with Canes or even El Pollo Loco for your fast chicken!"}
{"text":"Went to Popeyes for the first time yesterday in about six months because the last time we went it took forever to get the food so we figured we give it another try. The problem is not the food the problem is the service and they need new management and to be professional because every time we've been there it's that the staff is arguing amongst each other , she  told me to drop spicy not mild and then you're waiting like 20 minutes or more for what you ordered and it just gets frustrating and it's not that clean in the waiting area and it's a shame because they do serve good food but you shouldn't have to go through the hassle of them giving you someone else's order or them getting your order wrong. Just some advice. As a manager you  should work and teach your employees by example. So if they see you act in a certain way then They think that they should act in a certain way so maybe as  the manager  you should step your game up so your employees can become better employees because they're only going by how they are trained and what they see. Maybe if you just fix a few small things you would have better business and more customers because people are just tired of the frustration ."}
{"text":"Came here recently, felt good. The store, and also the bathroom, were clean. Service was fast and the chicken tasted fine. Compared to some other Popeyes, this was definitely a nicer joint."}
{"text":"The people there are super nice, great service, told them about my bad experience at KFC and they gave me 10% off which was awesome, the only down side is that they don't serve mac and cheese"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE DRIVE THRU. Waited about 8 minutes at the speaker box only to be told to pull up to the window and wait another 3 minutes just for someone to tell me \"the drive thru is closed.\" No apology, no sign... No nothing. Awful display of customer service."}
{"text":"Wow...So I'm a church's chicken kinda guy, but today I decided to go to Popeyes...because? Because I haven't been since I was a youngster. And also cuz the other day I went to church's and the chicken wasn't all that good. So today I decided to cheat on church's and go to Popeyes. Popeyes you let me down, I honestly thought that it was going to be better than this \"that's what I get for cheating\" I ordered a two piece chicken with 2 sides and I thought I was ordering for my son, 2 little baby pieces of chicken which by the way it would've been perfect for my son. In a nut shell it was a kids meal at an adult price. So forgive me #churchsfriedchicken for cheating on you, I promise I will never be unfaithful to you again."}
{"text":"Second time eating here in two weeks. First time was not good. Cold fries, cole slaw drowning in mayo,  premises dirty. Complaining to management,  they offered us two free combo meals. On this visit better experience but still below my standards. Red beans and rice good, biscuits excellent chicken pieces smaller than their competitors. Albertson grocery store has the best fried chicken in town."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly but disappointed in the food. At 5pm. Chicken was not hot and tasted like it was out for several hours.  Same with the fries. They were cold.  Not too many people in store but drive thru was fairly busy. Spicy chicken was not spicy. Seemed like maybe they mixed them up because I did not taste any spice in them. Red beans and rice were also plain. Too bad because I love Cajun food."}
{"text":"Went today.the lady at counter was resting her hand on counter to hold her head up.i stood there and stated I am ready to order.   I would like to have the 10-piece dinner along with coleslaw. Moments later she said they're out of coleslaw what else would you like I said I would like to have green beans so when I got home there were no green beans I got some kind of bean and rice mixture and the chicken was dried out very very small pieces and all dark meat. Obviously I threw the chicken away it was not edible"}
{"text":"The chicken strips looked like the chickens they came from were anorexic! All batter NO MEAT! Not to mention they upset my stomach!"}
{"text":"This place is good at one thing and thats getting your order wrong. Aside from getting your order wrong, service is beyond slow!"}
{"text":"I've always had positive experience here.  We order about once a month delivery for wings and it always arrive quickly and the wings are PIPING HOT.  Their wings are so delicious, consistently good each time, excellent flavour with a good kick of spice, meat is tender and juicy.  I also have to commend the drivers for always always always being very quick and hard working on getting my orders to satisfy my cravings."}
{"text":"What has happen to Popeye's?  They use to be so good. Chicken use to be nicely seasoned and fresh.  Just ordered a combo at this location. Chicken was burnt.  Went through drive thru. Noticed it at home. No more Popeye's for me. Stay away."}
{"text":"The parking lot is quite limited & must be shared by many other stores in the complex. There are rarely any free spots & the people who parks there tend to never look around prior coming out of their parking spot. The service from popeye itself is good. They served fast when I ordered 12 pieces. It was ready in 2 mins and the amount of spicy & non-spicy was correct. Im happy."}
{"text":"I would have to say this location of Popeyes in Scarborough is one of the worst. They skimp out really hard on their ingredients and the quality compared to other locations is bad"}
{"text":"The food taste ok. I do consistently get dry chicken. My problem is the employees. They never seem to care, nor do they seem to have a sense of urgency. Asking for hot sauce or chicken strip sauce is a burden.I have never gotten a correct order from this location. the place is always dirty and the workers seem to hate being there. 

I will continue to eat at the Elliot Road Popeye's. They're a little nicer."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this location gets such bad reviews but I've been here 2x and it's been on POINT!

First off, I've never lived so close to a Popeyes before! I'd have to go out of the way or be in the area in California to enjoy some Popeyes! Now I live about 10 minutes away from one and OMG!

The food is so fresh no matter what time you come, I came last night (01/08/16) late and my food was so fresh and point! The biscuits were piping hot, my chicken was fresh and my sides were delicious! Also my orders have never been wrong, they've always gotten it right ^_^

Customer service is okay, food has been consistent both times! Also their sweet tea is delicious!! Only downfall is that they charge for sauces :/ Thank you Popeyes for being so good yet so bad for me LOL!"}
{"text":"Staff are slow and not very organized.  Cashier chewing gum like a cow chews it's cud.  Chicken was dry.  Definitely had better and will try another location."}
{"text":"This place deserves zero stars. Filed many complaints with corporate about drive thru order taking over 30 minutes. Today after wasting 50 minutes I left without food and without a receipt that a refund was actually processed because the supervisor Shelly apparently doesn't know how to reprint a receipt. Last time I had an issue Shelly was too busy texting on her phone to acknowledge my concerns. The excuse tonight was hat only 4 people were working."}
{"text":"This location has its problems. Today, I go there get a 4 piece chicken dinner, should get leg,thigh,drumstick,and breast. Wrong! Received 2 wings, breast, and thigh, what happened to my drumstick? Oh, by the way did not receive a dinner roll, and this has happened on more than one occasion, how hard is it to make sure each dinner has a roll included. Sometimes when you go there they are out of mild chicken and have to pull around in front of the store for them to bring out your chicken. I go there about 2 times a month and lets say out of 24 visits in a year, the out of mild chicken has happened about 5 times!"}
{"text":"Pros
1) tasty food

Cons
1) slow service, both wait in line to order, and for food to be cooked
2) expensive
3) the floor, tables and order area is rather filthy, oily...."}
{"text":"Great service and speed along with friendly staff. I came in at 9:30 with a bus full of hungry track athletes at 9pm and took up every seat there was (I was unaware this location was attached to a gas station and smaller than most). The service was quick (2 minutes to get an order out tops) and friendly. They took about 50 hungry athletes and coaches orders and had us all served inside 20 minutes. As we left the manager brought a bunch of hot apple pies out to us, thanked us for stopping in, and apologized for the slow service (which wasn't slow at all)."}
{"text":"Clean place, but no Tuesday special? That sucks when I feed my crew. Maybe the manager can change that policy."}
{"text":"You better ask for the things you would normally would expect from any other location,  napkins, fork,  straw, cocktail sauce."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but I probably won't be returning. I had to wait half an hour for an order of tenders when the kid at the register had told me they were ready as I was ordering. Then I got home and the order was wrong! It was one chicken tender combo, how'd they mess up so much?"}
{"text":"Service was good, but that was probably because they wanted to hide how disgusting this location is. I saw three dead cockroaches in the dining room."}
{"text":"Hassled by homeless inside the restaurant... not a single staff helped.... dont go unless you want to be hassled by crazy people.... go to bigger ones"}
{"text":"2nd and probably last time there. Good food lousy service. Order was wrong again. Sorry but i have to judge the book by the cover on this one."}
{"text":"I have a dirty secret to share y'all every now and then I get a MAD craving for Popeye's chicken. Obviously it's not the healthiest thing on the planet but they do chicken right and mostly better than the Colonel's brand. Popeye's chicken is as juicy, crispy, super crunchy and hot as you can get for franchise fried chicken. I like to get their spicy fried chicken, it has a nice tabasco spicy kick to it. Fries are a bit limpy here but not as bad as KFC's and their biscuits are like eating fluffy dough like wads of buttah-scrummy. Popeye's chicken is best enjoyed every now and then cuz I'm sure there are a gazillion grams of fat in every meal."}
{"text":"The worst service I have had in a long time, small place you think it would be better, the guy throws the food on a tray and fails to inform me soda machines  are down, does not offer me any alternative. Pathetic cashier, I would fire him. I feel sorry for the manager! 4:45 pm Friday afternoon"}
{"text":"It took Just-eat 2 hours and 15 min to make one delivery!
I live near Bayview/Sheppard and usually use Ubereat to order from Popeye, but this location of Popeyes uses just-eat.ca. 
7:05 We placed an order for 8 pieces of chicken, side order of coleslaw and cajun fries and 1 biscuit. Estimated delivery time 8pm (55 minutes!). Ok it's a Friday night, I guess they are super busy. No problem. 
8pm rolls around, and it suddenly says estimated delivery time 8:30pm! The just-eat website states to call the restaurant. So we call the restaurant, they said the order has been picked up already. Which I don't believe since the restaurant is only 10 min away. 
8:30pm Still waiting, now it says estimated delivery time 9pm. We are disappointed, furious, frustrated, we want to cancel our order and get a refund.  
We call Just-eat, and they automated message says to start a Live chat. We started a live chat, and nobody has answered our message after 15 min. We call Just eat again, and still on hold after 15 min. The driver has been changed 3 times so far. 
It's been 2 hours and our food still has not arrived. 
9:20pm 2 hours and 15 min later the food finally arrives :(

Damage - $31 (tax and tip included). 
Do not order from just-eat! Terrible delivery service."}
{"text":"First, I love their chicken, red beans & rice and biscuits. I use to go to the Rancho location because I believed it was better. But, this time I believe everything was fresh and yummy.

But, the only complaint I have is the fact that anytime I order the chicken tenders I have to wait for them to be done. My fiance doesn't mind because he says they are \"extra fresh\" but if I am in a hurry to get home I know I will be waiting at least 5 minutes. Just a FYI"}
{"text":"I love fried chicken, so, Popeyes has always been one of those restaurants on my stop list. Compared the other fast food chicken places I have found that this brands chicken less greasy than some of the others. The spicy chicken has s bit of a bite, but, makes for a quick meal. The service has always been good , the people are quick to greet you and my order had been quick. The best thing about Popeyes they have a more Southern sides menu with the beans, beans and rice and other more traditional items. As for a quick stop chicken joint they do well. No comparison to traditional Southern places such as  Gus's in Memphis, but, as a local chicken place, better than most."}
{"text":"Love the spicy chicken. Located next to the Circle K. Service was good and the wait minimal. When we got the order it was not correct. They fixed it right away and gave us another side. One if the workers heard me mention that the order was wrong and took it back immediately and for my trouble gave me two additional pieces of chicken. I was impressed with their concern and attention to detail."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I think so highly of this amazing food chain. I have never once been disappointed by what lies in that beautiful white and orange paper box. I have been eating at Popeyes for about 10 years now and will continue to do so until the day I lose all my teeth, and even then I will probably buy the chicken just to smell it. Once I even snuck onto an Air Force base just because it was the only Popeyes near by. Worth it.  

Always order a number 3 spicy with a side of mashed potatoes a side of their decadent \"sweet heat\" sauce and a sweet tea. I can taste the spicy chicken watering in my mouth right now as I write this review. I could eat this meal three times a day every day for the rest of my life. I'm on death row about to go to the chair and what do I request as my last meal? You guessed it. 

One night about 2 years ago I'd just gotten dumped and went to the only place I knew could cheer me up, a Popeyes Louisiana chicken. I was visibly upset and the amazing staff could tell. Not only did the manager take the time to personally console me, he upgraded my sweet tea to a large and gave me 3 extra biscuits! Obviously my mood did a complete 180, no therapist could have ever done that for me. 

To prove I'm not complete biased and doing this as a ad or anything like that I will give one negative review. Once I ordered my typical meal and they gave me fries instead of the taters and I didn't realize until I got home. (I love about 45 minutes from my closest Popeyes so I couldn't just turn around and get it fixed). This was obviously devastating to me, but I ate the fries and they were actually quite tasty so I'll let it slide just this once. Now I always do a quick scan before I leave, but I've yet to be disappointed again! 

Though I could go on forever I'll wrap things up. Popeyes will always have a huge spot in heart and I'm pretty cold hearted so that's really saying something. If my future husband doesn't allow Popeyes to cater our wedding AND rehearsal dinner I'm saying no when he proposes. So propel, RUN DON'T WALK to the nearest Popeyes Louisiana Chicken and be prepared to have the best darn fried chicken of your life. God bless."}
{"text":"I've been to several Popeyes, this is the first one I've visited that doesn't carry the butterfly shrimp, which is their best menu item. What does that say about this location if they don't support the menu. Not sure who to blame for that, Popeye's or this franchise owner, but either way I won't be back."}
{"text":"Seems like people only get free stuff when they leave bad reviews and the owners grow a conscience.... but this popeyes is amazing and i wish i could get some free chicken for my fandom!"}
{"text":"This place is not worth the chicken and horrible horrible management. They short ordered us twice and when we returned back to restaurant to get our food we \"PAID FOR\" the manager tells us to bring back our entire order in order for her to fill it correctly! What is wrong with this? What's wrong is why would you offer to remake our meal if we bring the entire order back after we already sat our family down to dinner (5 children and 2 adults) for you to complete our order we PAID FOR? Ridiculous!! Go back to Management 101 and take a few more lessons in customer service and how to correct an order already purchased! Reality your ripping people off and stealing their money when you don't provide the customer with the item they PURCHASED!!!!! 
I shy the other way each time I drive by your restaurant! And won't return! Your rude!"}
{"text":"I just moved back to the neighborhood  and each time I have went to this place they forgot something I ordered. I don't know if they shorting people items like pies and keeping the $$$. Needless to say I will be sitting at the window until my complete order is checked. I would advise you all to do the same."}
{"text":"Second time this happened at this Popeye's.  I will be calling Corporate tomorrow.

They don't close until midnight.  Came through drivethru at 9:35 and tried to order chicken strips and was told they're in the process of closing and don't have any chicken strips.  Who does that?  They're still open for 2-1/2 hours and they stop selling cerain items?  Second time this has happened at this Popeye's.  So disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I'm even rating this a 1 star. Spent $32 for 16 pieces of chicken tenders that were not only small, but tasted like it was a product of frozen food and undercooked. We were so excited when they opened up Popeyes by us, but after that last experience I honestly get sick thinking about going there again. While the commercials look tempting, I quickly have a very vivid flashback of those chicken tenders and price. Initially went in for the family meal, switched to chicken tenders instead of the bone in and it cost us double the price of the meal. What a rip off. Should've looked in the box before leaving to see the actual product. I think I would've complained on the spot and not pay that inflated price. I am definitely sticking to Raisin Canes, at least I know they're fresh, taste good and not frozen prior."}
{"text":"Normally I love Popeyes, but this location is the worst. I moved here from CA, and I will never go back to this restaurant. First off, the staff was not very cordial at the drive thru window. Our chicken strips had the rubbery texture of calamari. The biscuits were dry and they didn't give me cocktail sauce with my shrimp. On top of that, this location does not have Jambalaya!!! I'd give no stars if I could."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! Drive-thru is always long, service is slow and poor. I have to repeat my order numerous times and when I do staff STILL get the order wrong. I've had my order wrong so many times to where I've gotten home and had to drive all the way back (I should've checked my food before leaving) BUT it's fast food how hard is it to make sure your customer has spicy or mild chicken? or that their side orders are correct?! I used to work at Popeyes so there is no excuse as to why I am a regular customer and the same occurrences continue to happen. Very disappointed in this location!"}
{"text":"We were there on 3/18/2014 at 430 pm. Lets start at the order process, the girl at the register, was not paying attention to us, was not helpful, it was not entirely her fault she just needed more training. She also seemed to be distracted by the other people around her and joking and talking with them more than doing her job. Next the place looked clean, but the floor is sticky, and I saw how they mopped the floor, with a wet mop, instead of a dry mop. I go up to go get more soda and I slipped on the floor. So they need training on this too.  I changed tables 3 times to find one that was not as sticky not a good sign. and yes I saw how they wiped down the tables with just a rag, but no bucket to rinse the rag between wiping, and then they used the same rag to wipe the chairs again with out it being rinsed out. So make me wonder how the back of the house is maintained. So I will probably never eat here again for a while. On a positive note the food was great, tender, crunchy. So train your staff of cleaning and it should be a great place to come eat."}
{"text":"This has been consistently the worst Popeyes I've ever been to. In fact I've decided I'll no longer go here and I'm going to tell everyone I know how horrible this place is. 

I'll come back and write an actual review soon, but for now I wanted to save you time, money and frustration by telling you DO NOT EAT HERE!

Horrible service, slow service, below average food quality, and absolutely insane excuses given for incompetence!"}
{"text":"Seriously the worst Popeyes. Not for food, but the ingenious workers. no one pays attention to what you are ordering, they are always running well behind. Always behind on chicken,  etc. Takes forever to receive an order."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday! Tried to order 8pcs chicken spicy, Cashier asked the line cook how long and they said 9 minutes I told them I'm willing to wait but someone comes outside and told me if I can do Half Spicy Half Regular I said its fine I'm willing to wait but he insist and told me its bigger pieces and and I said Okay I'll take it! And when I went home 3 pcs hot and new and the remaining were OLD!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ghetto.com. 10:45am food was not prepared, registers were not opened. Was informed they were still waiting on manager. SMH....what's going on popeye's??"}
{"text":"Visiting this location on Halloween night is admittedly a rather busy time, however the staff here were repeatedly plagued by missing items in our order.  I came with two friends, both friends ordered first and were missing items from their order. Me, having ordered last, assumed that at the very least they would get MY order right. Unfortunately, upon arriving back at our residence (we ordered take-out) I realized that several components of my order were missing (an order of fries and biscuits as well as side sauces).
This is not the first time that such oversights have occurred to me personally at this location.  The manager is pleasant (he took our order) but they have a serious problem with their staff messing up orders.  As much as I love Popeye's, I am unlikely to return as a lot of money goes wasted at this location.  A shame for a much beloved franchise."}
{"text":"This location is famous for poor service even hen they are not busy. If you try to order delivery the answering machine picks up and the machine is full. If you get an actual person on the phone the person has a huge issue understanding enough English to take your order. My Family is so done with the half wits at this location!"}
{"text":"The chicken was not as hot as I like it. Also, I ordered mild and got spicy. Very friendly register person and Christian music playing overhead made up for sub-par food."}
{"text":"This week I ordered the chicken tender monday special, its funny because the only thing special about it was that it seemed like it came straight out of the microwave! The skin was as soft as pancakes and it wasn't very hot. It was served during rush hour so I don't know how they can serve old soft and room temperature fried chicken when they are serving several people during lunch time! I guess that's why the service was rather quick. I must say the fries were on point tho ;) but i wont come to this popeye's again, the quality standards are pretty low."}
{"text":"Went back to see if Popeye's had improved any. They have jacked up their prices to a ridiculous level ($18 for 12 pieces of chicken). We drove away without ordering and I really have my doubts about ever going back. Humph!"}
{"text":"The only time I would suggest to come and get fookd here is a lunch time. This guarantees your fresh fried chicken. I've been here a few times late evenijng and the chicken taste old and extremely greasy. Like they just re fried it quickly to gill the order through drive thru. But if you come at lunch during the week make sure you have a lot of time on hand. I work down the street and it takes me about 25 minutes just to get out of the drive thru line with my meal.  Just a word to the wise."}
{"text":"Slow... Slow... Slow... Slow.... Will not be back.
Love the chicken, but it is not worth my entire evening!!"}
{"text":"I'm so mad at this location. I'm grabbing lunch with my boyfriend and we pulled up to this location. We ordered 2 holiday specials both with red beans and rice but one with mashed potatoes. I pull up to the window and ask the lady if I could change my mashed potatoes to Cajun fries. She said it would be an extra few minutes I said ok and we waited. She finally handed us our food and our debit  card I asked her for hot sauce, buffalo sauce, and honey. She huffed and rolled her eyes at me. Smh I was so upset. I love their food it's great but their customer service is so horrible!!!!"}
{"text":"Pulling up, the parking lot was packed so I opted for the drive-through. There are two drive-through lanes and one was free. It took less than five minutes from the time I place my order, to the time I had my 3 boxed dinners and was driving off. Placing my order was easy as the menu is very well organized and the order taker asked specifically for the side, mild or spicy, sauce (sweat heat is to die for!) and drink.  

The food was tasty. My 6 yr old who is an extremely picky eater, even enjoyed the popcorn shrimp (she may or may not have been told it was chicken) but said it was a bit spicy (I guess for a 6 yr old it may have been). The chicken tenders and bone in chicken were both good. Had the cajun fries, mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes. 

Priced comparable to Church's but we will definitely drive out of our way to go to Popeyes (about 4
Miles from us) instead of Church's (about 1/2 mile away) since they got our order right (something Church's never can accomplish)"}
{"text":"One of the few joys in life is southern fried chicken! 

In greater Phoenix, you need to work hard to find a Popeye's, and to some extent a Churches.  So we were happy to see the Cajun folks from NOLA haven't given up on us just yet.

This Popeyes is part of a Circle K gas station and is a few blocks from the 101.  It's not necessarily easy on/easy off, but close.  The gas station and fast food folks tend to go back forth and because of the neighborhood it can get a little sketchy at night, so use the drive thru.

For those who have dined only at the Colonel's, this might be a shock to the system!  Popeyes serves both Cajun spicy and regular fried chicken, but I've found their Sides to be outstanding.  

You have red beans and rice, Cajun mash potatoes (ask for extra gravy), and if you can find it, the best onion rings in fast food-land.  

Sadly, I must report that Popeyes no longer has Cajun Sparkle (packets of Cajun spices) with MSG.  If you thought a double latte got your heart started, then Cajun Sparkle with MSG was a lot more fun!  LOL!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is your typical Popeye's Louisiana Kitchen gas station location, but serving up some decent chicken. 

There isn't a great many free standing Popeye's locations here in the Valley, while it's former corporate sister Church's, seem to have nothing but free standing places. 

I have a friend who use to own two franchises in the Midwest back in the day. He and everyone who ever met Popeye's founder, Al Copeland thought the world of him. Copeland had this NOLA style, Horatio Alger story. Rags to riches, back to rags... well, not quite.  But in the end, Copland had enough to leave a bunch of money to LSU.  Not bad for a high school dropout.

The secret, as most Popeye aficionados will tell you, is to come here when they are running special. Like Tuesdays, when the special is 2 pieces of chicken, biscuit and a drink for $3.99. Otherwise, it can be just as expensive as the Colonels' place. But Popeye's chicken is better!  

Oh, how I miss the MSG laced Cajun Sparkle.  It was better than coffee. LOL. Three Stars, A-Okay."}
{"text":"This location does not participate in the Tuesday deal of $1.49 leg and thigh. But the one on Maryland and Tropicana does."}
{"text":"I love Popeye's. This location had a quick drive through but the customer service could be better. The worker at the drive through didn't even look at me when handing me my food, thus, the bag of food hit me in the face and I don't even think she noticed. I was just handed my food and the window slammed immediately, before I could make any requests for sauce or anything else. I normally don't review places like this but am only doing so because this was the most bizarre drive through experience I've had so far."}
{"text":"I come to this place on a regular basis and it's pretty good for the most part.  The place is always pretty clean, and the workers are friendly.  Like most fast food, it's hit or miss, but I mostly have good food, and they're helpful whenever you have any issues with your food."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Monte Carlo and had a hankering for some spicy wings. After reading  a lot of BAD reviews of Popeyes in the Vegas area I was a bit hesitant to come to the food court where this Popeyes was located. 

This Popeyes is located on the Strip and you take an elevator to the second floor. Lots of other chain food places too. 

I ordered 3 spicy wings. I was told there were 2 spicy wings and 1 regular wing. I asked if I could wait for a new batch of spicy wings. The server, Lizette told me no problem and if I wouldn't mind waiting 12 minutes. I said sure.

This is where excellent customer service shows up. I was waiting....it had been about 5 minutes. Lizette hands me a cup for a free soda. I ask what is that for. She says its for having to wait for my order. I declined, but I sincerely appreciated her thoughtful gesture. Great job Lizette---you really know how to take care of customers!"}
{"text":"My 1st time at this place, have to say the staff, Maria & the others, super helpful & no drama or attitude!! Very pleased to see all smiling!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure if it's the Cajun but this chicken is so addictive! I tried to quit it but I keep relapsing. This location is pretty nice for a fast food restaurant. There are lots of spacey booths, free WiFi, and clean washrooms. Parking is a headache though. Try to avoid busy hours in this plaza."}
{"text":"I love Popeye's food. I ate here with my wife, we were shown good customer service. I do wish the food was a little fresher and hotter but other than that I reallly enjoyed my visit."}
{"text":"Airport food. The thought conjurs images of bad meals at high prices in rushed circumstances. That's actually not too far off from most experiences. The last several years have seen an attempt to curb that expectation. Nicer spots. Local spots. Fresher food. Popeyes is none of those things. It's the original thought: overpriced food in rushed circumstances. 

Look, I've been to Popeyes a few times before. About ten years ago I discovered it out of town and actually really liked it. It's much better than the colonel's, I thought, and with a southern flair I really appreciated. So I thought I knew what to expect. But this really missed the mark, even for marginal airport food.

I had some time. Not a ton, but enough that I could have eaten somewhere a little nicer. But hey, it's been several years since I had Popeyes and it sounded good. I arrived, and even though there was a line it moved quite quickly. I ordered a five-piece tender basket (spicy) and even though it was going to be a few extra minutes, as they let me know, I went ahead with the order while they made a new batch.

For value, I actually think you're doing okay here. It's close to 12 bucks or so for this, but it's a lot of food--you get five impressively large tenders, a biscuit, and one side. If you opt for the full combo, you get a drink for an extra couple of bucks.

Unfortunately, quantity far outpaced quality. Yes, they were piping hot when I got them, but the tenders were not good. Even though I had waited for the spicy, there was no spice like I've tasted at Popeyes before. They were long and stringy, and I actually had a hard time biting through a couple of them, as they were spongy and bouncy. Not exactly the adjectives one would want to use when describing fried chicken. Twinkies, maybe, but not tenders.

The saving grace was the biscuit, and maybe the red beans and rice. They were both standard and dependable, and helped me get through some tenders. But I made a bad decision to eat here, and I'll own it. After I was done I had a bad taste in my mouth--literally and figuratively--and went elsewhere in the airport to find a smoothie to wash it out."}
{"text":"All I see I'd fake 4 and 5 star reviews! What's the point of a drivethru if they make you pull out to the parking lot and wait...  To make matters worse a screw up my order and forget to give me some sides. when I go inside  They're all joking and playing like it's a game \"sorry sir we're in training\" is answer I got. Some management!

 6 PM picking up food after a long days of work to go home You're expecting  Fast reliable drive thru service....not this garbage

I'm writing this at a red light just around the corner from the place they better hope and my food taste good when I get home otherwise I will drive back and asked for my money back and make a stink about it"}
{"text":"This particular Popeyes is a live, hate relationship! I keep coming because I love the food, however they ALWAYS mess up my order! 

This particular visit, I was over charged by over $10 because they messed up. To make matters worse the manager in the store didn't know how to process a refund. After 15 minutes the refund still wasn't processed, and she said that she was still in training and there was no other manager???

After 15 minuets I still didn't get my food, and three employees had gotten theirs, as well as someone who ordered after us! 

I finally told the manager I wanted my card back, and that I didn't want the food. She didn't offer anything for the mistake or try to correct it whatsoever!"}
{"text":"Unimpressed. The floor of the lobby was sticky and slippery at the same time.  The staff did not seem interested in getting our order ready after it was placed and 3 cars went through the drive thru while we waited for our simple order."}
{"text":"This place is clean. Staff is nice. Food is good, but service could be better. The efficiency needs a lot of work. The manager/supervisor needs to stay inside the restaurant and supervise."}
{"text":"I thought it was $33 for a chicken tender family meal. Not a chicken nugget meal. Lots of attitude at this location as well."}
{"text":"Service was attentive, prompt and courteous. Food was hot and delicious. Don't mind high prices much nicer and cleaner than the previous establishment."}
{"text":"This was the worst meal I've had. The chicken was dry and tough, the popcorn shrimp was mostly breading, and the fish was small. I wouldn't feed this food to my dog."}
{"text":"I have been a regular eater at Popeyes but recently two things have started bothering me.one,the size of their chicken,for example a drum stick is smaller than a small wing.second,. Chicken is so over cooked and dry that i have to throw away skin and crispy part(which is anybody's favorite normally) because it's so hard and un chewable.never going to Popeyes again.atleast until they fix it."}
{"text":"For literally the millionth time we gave them a second chance and once again, they failed horribly.  After going to the drive through with a hand written sign saying \"not open truck didn't come\" to only having half the menu, tonight was my last straw.  After much advertisement of \"new management\" we decided to give it one more try.  Online stated they were open until ten, at 9:10 pulled into the drive-thru we were told they closed because they \"didn't have any fresh product\".........ummmmm make some fresh product you are a fast food restaurant, that is what you do.  I will never be back, and advise anyone to stay away, at the very best you will wait 20 to 30 minutes, and again this is best case scenario, the majority of the time they will either be closed or not have what you ordered."}
{"text":"Pretty much everything I experienced in all of these these feeds from other people,customer service stinks , employees have attitudes, cursing racist comments forgetting to turn off their microphones spewing racial slurs."}
{"text":"Slow service, waited over 30 mins to get 2 meals. I can see the drive though line pile up as they have to wait just as long. Dont recommend if you expect fast food. They also dont leave any utensils or paper napkins out and give you very little with your meal. Got 2 meals and one fork.  Have to go up and ask for more. The last guy that just walked out was pissed at the service.  Dont eat here."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review for my brother who visited this location 3x within the past month. All three times, something was always missing from the order. A coleslaw, biscuit or extra sauce for which he paid. Not only should you ask if everything is ready in the bag, but check it yourself as well.

Other than that, chicken was always crispy and haven't experienced any \"raw\" pieces like a few other yelpers had mentioned."}
{"text":"Nice and clean place, food quality is great! It looks like rhe owner himself takes order."}
{"text":"\"love that chicken at  Popeye's\" as long as the staff aren't being slouches. So I only recently discovered popeye's a year ago, so I quickly became a fan. Love the spices the biscuits the fries and the fact that it's not super salty like ye ole Mr.Sanders chicken. This place is usually running smooth, when I go. However there have been some times where it seems like they are all over the place with service. I realize a business gets busy but need, staff to be more on the ball. Little things like missing the drink lids, napkins, condiments, giving people the wrong orders and such. I know they could do better they just need the right person to keep em in check. I still have yet to try Cane's and Church's for my fried chicken needs, so for now my loyalty belongs with popeye's."}
{"text":"Been coming here every Tuesday with the family for 2 years know always drive through . Fried chicken mild just the skin will make your knees buckle. Chicken always perfection juicier then a gallon of Tampico and seasoned to make you eat till you go into a fried chicken coma.... 2 pieces of fried chicken for .99¢ can't beat it!"}
{"text":"The usual Popeye's tasty chicken. Excessive breading when compared to KFC. Great daily deals. Staff are friendly and efficient. Booths are clean and really spacey. Clean washrooms. No drive thru. No WiFi."}

{"text":"I really love it popeyes chicken spicy fries different is better than !!!...Kfc chicken more teast too salt and too Mary chicken is teast for me ok ummm well \" best  one Popeyes \" smiling"}
{"text":"Thoroughly disappointed with this restaurant! Chicken tenders looked like chicken fries, was overly breaded and tasted like cat . Took forever to get our food and staff looked and acted like they hate their jobs. I actually wanted to give the girl, who took our order, a hug. Mac and cheese was like noodle soup with no flavor. I will give one more try because maybe it was just a bad day."}
{"text":"Okay, this is more 3.5 stars.  Opened as of 4 pm at Feb 26, 2014.  

After Popeye's terminated it's relationship with a franchisee who had previously run all the Mississauga locations, a bunch of wannabe's took its place such as Dave's, Max's, Quik Chick, etc.  While these were still infinitely better than KFC, I never realized how much better Popeye's was.  

About this location:
-It's clean and has a nice big layout.  The previous one on Hurontario and and Central Pkwy was quite filthy.
-Service was fast.  Got served within 2-3 minutes.  When I previously visited other Popeye's locations in Mississauga, it always took at least 5 minutes to get served.
-The mac n cheese is awesome! 
-Chicken is spiced nicely and I like the fact that the spice is marinated with the chicken as opposed to in the breading.  
-Owner looks a bit too serious. Maybe it was just his first day and wanted to make sure everything went okay.  I'd be stressed too.  
-It's too close to my house.  

Verdict: I will visit again, but will limit it because I don't want to gain 50 lbs in one month."}
{"text":"You know I've been here several times and tried to be patient with the workers there, but they always seem to find a way to F**k up my order, either they don't got biscuits or no mild chicken, never put honey in the bag.  No one their never knows what's going on. If I could give them negative stars I would. They should close the sorry A** Popeyes down and make it wing stop or a Canes. Another things it's too many crack/meth heads in the area. SMFH"}
{"text":"We went to this location tonight 9-23-2015. We have been there a few times before and usually later in the evening. Because this is such a busy Popeye's, by this time of night there's issues, frazzled employees and customers with not too much patience. The highlight of my visit tonight was sweet Mario at the front counter. He was so patient, so sweet and didn't let any of the chaos around him stress him out. He greeted us, took our order, apologized for the wait and at each step kept us updated. Such a special person! You are very lucky to have his calm disposition at your front counter. When we left he sent us out with best wishes for a great evening....you made our evening Mario."}
{"text":"I still love the food and service at this location. This review is not about the food or the service. They do not have hand paper in the restrooms. So that means that you and their employees must wash their hands open the door by the gross handle then go and serve your food. Most people do that anyway but here there's no choice.
Do people have any idea how gross the restroom door handle is?"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time. Worst experience. Was told the wrong waiting time waited twice the amount of time, just to get order wrong. I asked for dark meat only and got mixed. Family pissed, needless to say we will not be returning. They do not answer their phones, I believe they ignore it because they know its complaints. They were not busy to where they could not answer,"}
{"text":"The food is always good here, but when I ordered inside the cashier was not customer service friendly. She was talking to other people in the back and was cold to myself and other customers that ordered while I waited."}
{"text":"worst experience ever!  this dude that took my order ignored me when he asked me what i wanted to talk to his friend. after he took my order he said it would be a 3 minute wait for the fries, i said cool. he clock out and left  and i did not receive my fries until 30 minutes later when i asked if the fries where done."}
{"text":"This place fucking sucks. The lady at the drive thru had to ask me to repeat my order three times . It wasn't a complicated order. Fried shrimp combo with fries. 5 piece tender combo spicy with fries and kids meal nuggets with fries. Easy but the lady couldn't get it right. I go to the window and the lady asks once again what order it was and what drinks. I told her again, she gave me my order pretty quick but when I got home I found out it was the wrong order. And the food wasn't even good. Mostly burnt or half assed. Bad experience for my first Popeyes visit."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmm/mmmmmmmmmy they are really good News deliisous yummmymmyymymymymmymy I can explain how good it is its so freaki g good"}
{"text":"This evening I ordered the 5 piece chicken tender combo which included a drink. I paid for my order via the  drive thru, and the woman told me that it would take \"2\" minutes for the tenders to prepare which I was okay with. Well, it took approximately 10-12 minutes while there were other customers waiting in line behind me.  The woman apologized for the wait- Not good enough because she forgot to give me my drink!  I live on the other side of town, so I was not going to drive all the way back over there for a simple drink although the woman that gladly took my card and charged me $8.00 for the order should have been more on top of the situation.  The chicken tenders were tasteless! Needless to say, I do not recommend this location,  I observed employees moving in 'slow motion' no drive, no sense of urgency, people!  If you have a craving for chicken, go to the Popeye's in Tempe on Priest & Elliott Rd as they are a whole lot better in terms of customer service and good tasty chicken.
By the way, I attempted to contact their corporate office, and it will not submit for some reason it keeps timing out-how ironic!"}
{"text":"Very poor service and the store front/ setting area is a mess. I come here only simply for its location , today I decided stop in and it took the cashier 5 mins to even come and ask for my order , there was only one other person here ( who was just waiting for is order) . I ordered 5 piece chicken tender combo and asked for a order of small gravy on the side. I got everything from a warming tray and the cashier tried give my order without my fries , when I asked her why I didnt have fries she replied ( I didn't ask for them ) . She was very argumentative and all I wanted was just my order but it literally took 2 mins of arguing with her to get her to understand I wanted everything and just extra side order of gravy . Paying more wasn't even a issue ,It was a terrible experience ."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SRRVICE EVER! Waited 15 minutes just to to tell tge lady what we wanted. Its always like this at any Popeyes we go to in AZ. They seriously need to hire more people. NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO TO ANY POPEYES AFTER THIS VISIT!. If I could give them no stars I would."}
{"text":"The worst customer service! I was in line for 15 minutes at the drive thru and when I arrived to the order area I was told that they don't have any more chicken! So I asked to order sides instead and they said they have nothing at all -_- Really? I understant they close at 11pm but by the time I arrived at the order window it was still more than 5 minutes till 11. RUDE!!! Never going back to this location."}
{"text":"I usually get my fried chicken fix at Korean restaurants and I go to Popeyes on Tuesdays and Thursdays for their daily deals.

This is actually one of the better Popeyes I have visited. The chicken was properly cooked. Service is quick and friendly. The location is new and super clean. Plenty of booths. Free WiFi. This Popeyes delivers."}
{"text":"We were so excited to have a Popeyes chicken open up in SE Gilbert. At first, when they first opened up, the chicken was hot and fresh.  But the last few times we have been back the quality has been going down FAST. Very disappointed once again. This will be our last time going to Popeyes. The chicken has been dry.  I swear the chicken has been sitting on the rack all day. The pieces are getting smaller and full of breading and hardly any meat. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Popeyes is popeyes. Fried Chicken that isn't raw -ahem KFC- They have options for spicy and mild. My family usually only come here when we run out of ideas for dinner and this location is within walking distance so it's perfect for those nights. The chicken is oily but that is a given for fried food. I came in here for the Thursday special but since i ordered 3 orders of it for the family, they had to cook some more chicken because they didn't have enough thighs. They told me it would be a 15 minute wait which was fine. Not the fastest service considering it's fast food place but I didn't mind I had to wait 30 minutes after the dentist to eat anyways. 

The girl at the cash was obviously new and had to keep asking the other employees for help which I understood. 

What kind of threw me off was that you could see into the back of their kitchen and see someone on their break eating. They had their hair down and backpack on the table. Not sure if that is a designated employee tables but it was close enough to the kitchen to make me wondering food handling procedures here.

I will continue to come here to get my chicken but we do so about once or twice a month at most."}
{"text":"The worst Popeyes EVER. They are slower than molasses, their customer service is terrible, and it's always an extremely long wait. They do not tend to their customers. They act as if they do not care about you, your order or your time. If you think the drive-through is faster then you're wrong it'll be just as long if you were to go inside. Their food is either right or wrong so I suggest flipping a coin when considering going to this SLOW fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"I love Popeyes but this location is really not good at all... Please newcomers avoid at all cost!! First let me say my cashier taking the order was very nice and courteous I had no issue.

My husband and I have been to numerous locations and this one in particular around three times. Each and every time we were very disappointed and will probably never return to this location 

We usually order the 3 piece chicken strip meal complete with biscuit, fries and drink 

The soda machine was always leaking water and out of syrup. My Dr Pepper tasted like straight carbonation with little syrup, disgusting!! My husbands sweet tea tasted old and moldy!

Our chicken was very very dry as well as our biscuits and fries! My husband instead of getting 3 piece chicken strips he got one old dry chicken with bone in with two strips

Unfortunately after eating we had some stomach issues which included diarrhea mainly from food not being held at proper temperature and or keep too long or old. We will not be returning until it had been address or fixed 

If your desperate for food eat at your own risk!"}
{"text":"I've had Popeyes so many times because my college dorm had an on campus location right next to my dorm. This one wasn't very good with the service. The employees were very rude to me when I was there and even snickered at me because they thought I said something stupid. I do love Popeyes and the food was very fresh. For the fresh food that I love, I give this 2 extra stars. Had I only been rating the service I would've given half a star."}
{"text":"This is my second visit since they have opened. Long drawn out story short, Both times here the have screwed up my order. How do you mess up chicken strips c'mon. Besides thefood tasting good, Olivia was super nice and friendly both times and she wasn't even the one who messed up my order. I will be back but have to triple check my order b4 I leave."}
{"text":"My second time at this location yesterday & I won't be going back. The staff is not even slightly friendly & makes you feel unwelcomed everytime. Went during dinner rush & I understand it takes time but 30 minutes for fast food is kind of ridiculous for them to still forget part of my order & all the manager had to say was \"Oh\"."}
{"text":"Love Popeyes and the staff at this location is fun,  friendly,  helpful and really make you feel welcome

Now we cant eat fast food often but for those times that i crave fried chicken there is nothing like popeyes"}
{"text":"SHUT THIS LOCATION DOWN NOW 5th time and cold f...ing food horrible service manager told me to wait 3 min for fresh fried I was like cool then he was like oh wait there is an order here no one wanted and it ended up being soggy and cold fucking horrible. Bunch of gang related people no one cares about there job or service JUST SHUT THIS LOCATION DOWN. ZERO STARS"}
{"text":"They don't have the Tuesday specials. I told them other Popeye's have the Tuesday special why don't you guys. They replied different franchise Manager WTF !!!. He must be a greedy SOB ! Go to the Popeye's on Tenaya & Craig they have it there $1.49 Leg & thigh Tuesday special."}
{"text":"The worst service I Ever had in my life , the dirtiest Popeyes I've ever seen  employees & manager just don't give a f about the restaurant"}
{"text":"Would never go back again, was waiting for over 15 minutes then our cashier sneezed into his hands and went back to start preparing food without washing his hands or putting gloves on. When I asked him to please wash his hands he kind of sneered at me and went to another employee and was making comments about it. Clearly lack of management and sanitation is an issue. It'll only be a matter of time before the health department shuts them down."}
{"text":"At the airport. Very slow. Lots of stuff stacked up under hot lite so not very fresh. Had 2 piece with side of jambalaya. Requested 2 thighs. Checked box to make sure I got J. But when I went to bar next door for beer at HMS HOST noted 1 leg and one thigh.  Stupid me for not checking. Thigh was better. Jam was very dry. 

Will not do this one again."}
{"text":"Extra friendly employees and manager is awesome! Had to wait for my chicken and I was offered complimentary chicken and sides which was so nice of them but I had already ordered more food than planned so I turned the offer down. I was willing to wait for my food with no problem so no worries. They value their customers time so that's Awesome customer service! It is much appreciated!  thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Well if you want some nasty consistently stale greasy no meat on bones dried out  chicken then this is the place to go"}
{"text":"If this experience is indicative of what I should expect here, this isn't the best Popeye's (even though it's pretty new). We got four small sides and all of them were half-filled. The fries had obviously been sitting around too long and weren't remotely fresh."}
{"text":"Having never been to a Popeye's before, perhaps a Tuesday at 7:00 pm visit with the hangries wasn't the time for a first shot, but nothing during this visit would cause me to visit again. 

If there is a fast food place with a bigger cluster*expletive* ordering/ retrieving area for dine-in, I have yet to visit it.  The ordering area (from any one of 3 ambivalent teens who don't want to be there), pickup area and the solitary Freestyle machine are all within about 15 feet of each other - WHAT A DAMN MESS!   To add to that, I waited and waited and waited, watching people who came in after me get their food, until I finally asked the manager to get my food for me, his overall demeanor left a lot to be desired.  I had been waiting 15 minutes by then for chicken strips, mashed potatoes and a biscuit, so I asked him to throw it in a to-go bag so I could get out of there.

The strips (I got the regular, not spicy) were decent, the mashed potatoes are served with a watery chickeny gravy that I didn't care for but the potatoes were smooth and creamy, and the biscuit was hard/dry and overly salty.  

None of the employees seemed especially jazzed about being there.  This is a pretty new business, so I would perk the eff up, lest another restaurant at this end of town be shuttered and then bulldozed.  With a Chick Fil A a couple of hundred yards away (or McDonald's), there is absolutely no reason for me to return to this Popeye's.  If I want a fried chicken experience, I will head to KFC or to DD Pecker's for some of their southern wings - this Popeye's was *GONG* a loser."}
{"text":"I was about to place an order when I noticed how dirty the cooked chicken and fry area were and walked out. No way would I order from here."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time and thought it was average.  It took too long to get served and the store was not all that clean.  When we finally got our order they were out of some of the items so we had to wait longer.  I felt like the staff was not very interested in us being there and would rather not have to wait on anyone."}
{"text":"Chicken was tasty but 20 minute wait for fast food fried chicken!? SERIOUSLY?!? Go to Lo Lo's for better chicken and friendlier service."}
{"text":"I absolutely HATE this Popeyes!! Do not go here!! They never want to give you all dark meat.  They keep saying it has to be mixed and that is absolutely not true. The customer is always right but this Popeyes doesn't know the first thing about customer service at all!! Go to the one on Bonanza! Much more friendly and value their customers"}
{"text":"This will be short & sweet!

The commercials look good but the food is not living to the standard set. The chicken was completely soaked in grease/water and the corn on the cob was way overdone. As a southerner, I'm ashamed to have this associated with southern food.

Hopefully, it's just this location."}
{"text":"The night staff were rude, the manager was huffing and puffing after each order I made. The food was very dry and after specifically stating what I wanted they didn't get my order right. Hands down the worst Popeyes Location Ever! Needs new Management."}
{"text":"Me n my daughter just witnessed a lady manager tell a lady in the drive thru \"fuck you n fuck u too\"...  Assuming it was over the food because the customer (lady in drive thru asked for her money back
 Although a tiny bit funny, yes no! Not in front of my kids though! Where is this managers professionalism?? Where does she get to leave her manners and professionalism at home to treat a customer like that? I was really shocked by her behavior as Ive never seen such gross negligence for others by a \"manager\"
Friday at 6pm"}
{"text":"I've been to other Popeye's and LOVED them so I was SUPER excited to see one opening right near where I work.  Went there and ordered the three piece spicy chicken tender.  Bit into one and it was NOT COOKED ALL THE WAY!!  O M G.  Excuse me?!  You have the word \"Chicken\" in your restaurant's name...HOW do you screw that up??!!  I will NOT be back to this location.  EVER."}
{"text":"Popeyes at Rancho & 95 has undergone quite a transformation in the last couple of years. Had I written this review two years ago I would have given it two stars tops. The remodel and subsequent upgrades have vastly improved the quality of service that you receive via the drive up window. 

Back a couple years ago, every single time I would go there via drive thru to get a Shrimp Po' Boy and side of Cajun fries I would constantly be asked to pull around and park at the side waiting for my order. I appreciate that food was made to order but the constant need to wait was frustrating to say the least. It seems with the remodel that they also upgraded their cooking equipment to allow for quicker delivery of food items. I placed a traditional shrimp order and another sandwich for the kids. It was promptly served and the employee quickly processed my charge transaction. I would like to see them accept Apple Pay in the future, but that's a minor request. 

Overall, I think they offer a nice alternative to McDonalds and their Shrimp Po' Boy and Cajun fries are still awesome. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Rude service, the dining room felt like a freezer and food was not as good as other locations. this location is not worth going to!"}
{"text":"Do not waste your time going to this location!!!
There is constant turnover of management and employees, they still have not yet been able to get it right evidently.
I went to this location right after it opened originally, they completely screwed up my order, when I went back to address it with the manager, she told me \"tough shit\" and referred me to call corporate. I called corporate, left a very detailed message about the poor service and the managers choice of foul language and lack of assistance. I never received a call back from corporate.
I decided to give this location a second chance now that it has been open for a while, ordered chicken tenders and red beans and rice. When I got home the red beans and rice was only rice, no red bean mixture at all. Upon trying to call the store to let them know, the number beeps and goes nowhere.
This will be my last visit to this location.
I wish I could give negative stars..."}
{"text":"This is the WORST place I've ever been too in my life. I've given them 3 chances to earn my business and the 1st time I went they didn't have sauce and my food was cold! 2nd time the didn't have sauce again and had the audacity to get an attitude with me because I didn't want the food. And the 3rd time I went I sat in the drive thru waiting to place my order, no one ever answered so I drove up to the window and no one still helped me. I have never hated a place so much."}
{"text":"Located next to Hero Burgers, it used to be \"Coney Island Fried Chicken\", now renovated into a Popeyes.

Driven past this small plaza hundreds of time, but never dropped in because I thought parking was limited in the back. However a few of the stores sit empty (for lease), so plenty of parking left.

Spacious interior. Somewhat limited seating, but most order take-out anyways.

Fried chicken was decent. Stingy on the ketchup packets and napkins. But it's the same as any other Popeyes chain in the Greater Toronto Area. Not really complaining.

On the plus side, self serve soda machine allows you to mix creatively and unlimited refill!"}
{"text":"I am upset and disappointed at Popeye's chicken restaurant they have ended there 2 piece chicken special for 1.49 on Tuesdays I really look forward for Tuesday nights out with my husband and would always order my usaual 2 orders of the same for 1.49 plus a side of mash potatos and a drink now I guess I'll have to take a servey to get two free pieces of chicken. 
so if you are looking for that special you better go somewhere else because Popeye's has no more special for us very up set 
I guess you need to go to Texas or Louisiana because they Still have it for .99 on Tuesday's every Tuesday still I wonder why there and not here"}
{"text":"My husband and I had the chicken from here last night. We both are suffering from stomach aches...and diarrhea"}
{"text":"Worst Popeye's anywhere.  They do not serve spicy chicken at all.  This location should be called  POOPYEYES, since they do not serve spicy chicken.  In fact if you like spicy chicken go to the Skyline casino down the street and order either there wings or chicken fingers.  I order the fingers with extra hot wing sauce on the side.  Much better than POOPEYES."}
{"text":"Awful service, won't return. We ordered a 12 piece family meal, pulled up to the window and (silly me) decided a Coke sounded good. The kid at the window says \"My manager said I can't do any add-ons at the window.\" Are you kidding me?! Never had a business turn down my money before...So we get our food and get home, no utensils, no napkins and the meal is all dark meat. 6 drumsticks, 4 thighs and 2 wings. Very sloppy, take your money somewhere it's wanted and appreciated folks."}
{"text":"Went thru drive through for their Tuesday special. Car in front of me had a question. Male Manager in blue - Robert - converses with customer for over 10 mins. Scooted his way out of the window when it was my turn and crew apologized on his behalf for the long wait. I said the wait time was unacceptable. Drove home and within minutes called to complain. Lady that answered the phone said she was the manager, I said no - the guy in blue is - and she backtracked and said she was one of them. When Robert got on the phone he put me on speaker. Called him out on his unprofessionalism and he didn't even try to pacify my concern when in the first place he said he had to deal with the customer in line because she was upset. No Robert, she wasn't upset. You guys were flirting - on my time. You don't deserve the title manager and be thankful for the crew you have as they were more of a professional than you."}
{"text":"Poor service and rude management. 
Worst Popeyes I've been to in AZ. 
Food quality not consistent."}
{"text":"To start, it took the drive thru attendant almost 5 minutes to answer the hellos we kept saying.  Then when we ordered they gave us our food and no drinks. When we got home, which was a 5 mile drive south... this is the closest one to me.  The fries were hard and felt like rubber when I tried one.  Full of grease you could see it dripping.  Then my roommate opened his mashed potatoes and they forgot to add gravy!!! THIS WAS THE LAST STRAW.  How do you forget to do your job. The side is mashed potatoes AND gravy..... I'm never going back, I'll drive the 11miles it takes to get to the one on University Dr in Tempe."}
{"text":"These guys never mess up my order and I've been to every Popeyes in the Valley, this one is by far the best."}
{"text":"I see so many bad reviews and I don't get it. Kelsey gave amazing customer service, knew what to recommend, she walked around and cleaned as well. The food itself is worth coming here. I love their mashed potatoes and their spicy chicken is really good! Now this time kind of confused me for a second. I thought it was original and had to wait a second for a little bit of spice to come in! This location is in a great area right across the street from Smiths! Everything was really clean, including the bathroom. Maybe it's just the night staff that everyone complains about, but day time is great! They are a little too over priced in my opinion. 3 pieces of chicken, a biscuit, one side, and a drink was a little more than $8. Nothing really to complain too much about. All fried chicken places are over priced to be honest. 

So anyway, I love this location; there's a long wait? It's because they're busy and people want their food. They're out of chicken? It's because they probably have a certain amount they're able to make like most fast food places."}
{"text":"I love popeyes! Maybe its the crispy coating or the mouthwatering spices (mmmmm cajun) but i can't get enough!

Popeyes is a bit pricier than most (kfc) but i think they offer so much more. Their biscuits are amazing (think red lobster minus the cheese & garlic)

And where else can you get a box of those delicious biscuits for only $3.39?!

And the sides? Mashed potatoes with cajun gravy, corn on the cob, mac n cheese, onion rings, coleslaw and cajun fries all for $1.89 (small)

Headup- no free refills!"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try a Popeyes and I finally got my chance to try one on Dixie Road in Mississauga.  Considering I had to fly accross Canada just to try one was a feat in itself but actually it was convenient that we just happened to be there at the right time.

I'm just giving it an A-OK rating because we could only compare it to the chicken places that we love in BC.  Namely Churches, KFC for larger franchised chicken places and LA Chicken, Hi Five, Juke and Zabu some popular local eateries.

How did Popeyes compare?  a bit lower than we had thought and likely the reason why it may not appear here on the western shores of Canada.

I was a bit saddened to say this, but I'm sure that it could have been better had I not strayed from the basic chicken dishes and stuck with just that. Deep fried chicken is what we wanted, but ended up comparing with out deciding on their own merits and history of the chicken recipe that they are so famous for.

It is also what we're probably used to.

On a positive note, my pieces of chicken were good and moist and juicy.  The skin very crunchy.  On the crunch scale it is tops, but my old teeth prefer something a bit softer in the crunch department.  I'm sure that most Popeye aficionado will differ in their opinion.

Just stay away from the popcorn shrimp and the shrimp basket specials.

Fries were decent and I liked the coleslaw which is a must have for this kind of food.

My instagram video of the chicken crunch!

Sorry for the closeup of my nose caves."}
{"text":"I love Popeye's, I wish they could figure out how to avoid long waits for the meals. You would think they would know that during peak lunch times, that they will need more chicken. I've never found a location that has this mastered yet. I love the chicken, I love the chicken, I love the chicken. That is all."}
{"text":"No food to complain about......did not get any. This is a TERRIBLE POPEYES!!!! No one answers the drive thru so I had to drive around. Get to the window. A kid on the deep fryer just looks at me. No one comes up to help. I figure #%*+= this place and drive off. As I pull out I look inside and see a girl cleaning dining tables, no customers in sight. Priorities, people. Never again!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Popeyes, I hate the service. It may just be this particular one but if you plan on using the drive thru be prepared to park and wait for at least 20 minutes. I've never not had to wait. The food comes out hot, but after waiting forever it should be. The chicken is delish, we always get the spicy with fries and biscuits. By far the best biscuits. The fries kind of remind me of Rallys, but better! The Cajun mashed potatoes are also fantastic. Prices are average, cheaper then KFC, if I remember correctly. I would have given then 1 star because of the crappy service but since the food is so good it makes up for it!"}
{"text":"This place was awful. First and last experience at Popeyes. I'd heard a lot of good things about Popeyes and I'm not sure if it was just this store, but my experience was terrible. The chicken was so crispy, I think I might've damaged a few teeth. The Mac N Cheese, which was what I was looking forward to most, tasted like feet. The soda was flat, the mashed potatoes were a disgrace. There were flies everywhere. The best part was the buttery biscuit and the Cajun fries. Thoroughly disappointed with the entire experience."}
{"text":"I've been a Popeyes' fan for 40 years, and I have to say this is the worst franchise (store)  I have ever encountered.  They consistently get the orders wrong, the cashiers are slow and inept (There's always a line even during slow periods), and the place is a mess.  The trash cans are always stuffed so the customers can't dispose of their trash.  Most of the times I've stopped here I've had to search around for a napkin dispenser that isn't empty.  This is not an isolated incident, as I have stopped here multiple times with the same experience.
Yesterday, I ordered my usual 8 piece box of thighs and drumbsticks (mild), and when I got home and got the dinner ready to serve, discovered breasts and wings in the box (spicy).  Nobody in my family likes white meat. We live too far away from this location to make it worth driving back so we were stuck with it. From now on I'll be sure to check before I leave the store.
Popeyes should have done a better job in vetting this franchise owner, as he is giving the product a bad name. If this location had been my first experience with Popeyes, I would never again be a customer.

P.S.  I sent this review directly to Popeyes Corporate, and shortly thereafter received a phone call from a very rude person named Carlos who identified himself as the General Manager of this location.  He offered no apology, no empathy, and kept on calling me \"Sir\" even though he knows I'm a female.  Instead of trying to solve the problem, his tact was to scold me for not bringing it up to a Manager on Duty.  Apparently he's upset that now Popeyes Corporate is aware of the inadequate management of this location."}
{"text":"First visit ever to a popeyes in my 33 years of life. Pulled into drive thru which they have 2 ordering stations. Asked if they could give me just a minute to look over the menu then a guy comes on the intercom and asks if we are almost ready like he is in some type of rush. Not to ask if we had any questions or needed help. Absolutely horrible customer service. I backed right out if drive thru and went else where for dinner. To think these little kids want $15 an hour ha yeah right."}
{"text":"They need some serious training & a new manager. Cooks don't read order for no gravy on mashed, lady taking order ignored you while taking your order talking to other employees. The chicken it's self was good but the chicken tenders were stale as were the biscuits. She made a point to ask what sauce for tenders then didn't give us any. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"If you have been to Popeye's outside of the SW and expect the same forget it. Completely Mexican style. Thw mashed potatoe gravy is a spicy jalepeno gravy. Also the chicken is super miniature, like large wingettes. It was such a weird deal, almost like a movie, like they must be joking. Don't bother unless your in the mood for a light Mexican food snack."}
{"text":"When grabbing a quick bite to eat at an airport, I usually don't really expect much. However at this Popeyes at the McCarran airport, I was pleasantly surprised and appreciative of the customer service I received.  

I was greeted well by the front cashier whom this one filipina? female called \"Junior.\" He was very patient and respectful with a family before me who had no idea what to order and what was what. I usually don't frequent Popeyes and asked how was the jambalaya slide and the female working the food told me it was good.  She then asked if I wanted a sample.  I was actually quite shocked to be offered a sample at a fast food place.  That has never happened to me.  To be honest I didn't know exactly what jambalaya was so I decided that it was good enough to order.  I also asked for two breasts for my 2 pc combo, however she said it was another $1.8 charge. I respectfully declined the extra charge and ended up getting the breast and a leg.  

When I received my order, I sat down and saw she snuck in two legs and a breast.  She probably noticed I was a starving poor student, but either way the gesture was really nice of her and a pleasant surprise to have this type of customer service at a fast food place.  I regret catching her name but if you're ever there she is most likely the filipina person (heard her singing when I first approached the place)."}
{"text":"This Popeyes has good chicken and service is usually friendly and efficient. But problem is the parking.. Since the restaurant is located in a small strip plaza and shares parking with a supermarket, 4 out of 5 times I came here there was ZERO empty parking spots. Then we just went elsewhere to grab something to eat. If that problem is resolved I will for sure frequent here more often."}
{"text":"This place was awful. There were bugs in their spice jars on display in the middle of the dining room. They had 3 managers working with like 5 people eating in the restaurant. Not making great impressions for a restaurant that's only 7 months old. Will not return."}
{"text":"Twice now, i was told my order would take 5 minutes and to park on the side of the building  to wait. Today it ended up being almost a 20 minute wait and they forgot the large fries. Another depressing thing, no mac and cheese. I got a rude \"sorry\" and thats about it. Ive never been so hungry that it made me grumpy."}
{"text":"Out of coleslaw and ketchup on a Tuesday at 7p!  Ridiculous.  I was in the mood for Popeye's when I walked in, and generally underwhelmed when I walked out. Will be a long time before I return."}
{"text":"Hard fish, hard shrimp, water corn awful, strawberry drink no out,& chicken so hard could not cut with a real pocket knife. Ugh. The worst of course was the bathrooms how disgusting. Trying again.  But worse than before. Horrible service. Can't order shrimp unless it's a meal. Ugh NEVER AGAIN !!!!!"}
{"text":"These guys know what they're doing with their Halal bird.
Very friendly people, very clean inside, food very hot and fresh.. PLEASE.. stay this way.. Because compared to the location on Yonge North of Elgin Mills it's like night and day."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd disappointment I've had at this location. I pull up to drive through and order an 8 piece all dark spicy dinner with a large red beans and rice. Every time I have been here I've been the 3rd car in line and it always takes 15-20 to get to the window. So now for the 3rd time I am told that they don't have enough dark meat and can only give me 5 dark and two white. Constantly!! This time I want what I ordered 20 minutes ago. Sabrina the manager comes to the window to tell me that they don't have enough dark and that  Ill have to wait for another 9 minutes. I ask why this happens to me all the time and she said special orders always take longer. She then thought that I had ordered all white, saying it would take longer and if I wanted to wait. I said yes, and she asked me to pull away from the takeout window to which I said no. If it costs them business because they cant ever get an order right then I am staying put until they get me my correct order. How hard can that be? While I am waiting I see the manager on her phone and all the employees looking at me as if I'm the one that caused the problem. Two other employees came to the window asking me to pay or move my car to wait. I stay put. The third time I asked for the managers name and they said they didn't know. And that I was being rude. I just smiled and said I'm here until you get me my correct order. 10 more minutes go by and the cars behind me have left and all cars now coming up to the drive through are being told it is closed as I watch 3 other cars pull up to order and then back up to come inside. So I knew then that I would never get my meal. I left. ADIOS POPEYES..... NEVER EVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Went to Popeyes tonight for the first time in FOREVER. Never have I been treated so disrespectfully at an establishment. We picked up our food, got home, only to realize that they had gotten our order completely wrong. No big deal, people make mistakes. We gave them a call, and they told us if we drove ALL THE WAY back there they'd get what we were supposed to have gotten. THEN they tell us that they are out of what we originally ordered. So my boyfriend and I then tell them we want a refund for the difference of what we got and what we were supposed to have gotten. This girl then tells us she will go get her manager. 

As we were put \"on hold\" (she literally just places the phone down as her and her employees are laughing and giggling up a storm) and 10 minutes later, no manager has gotten the phone. 

after the ten minute hold, no manager came, and we were hung up on. Tried calling again, and no answer. 

NEVER WILL I RETURN TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT. and I will be warning everyone about what has happened today."}
{"text":"I've came to this location several times always get there chicken tenders. They have always got my order right & always tasted so good. There's been times I've waited around 15 mins or more for my order though so no longer becomes fast food. But either way I'll wait for fresh food."}
{"text":"I had never eaten at Popeyes, and to be honest while I like fried chicken and the like, I've had so much bad, soggy fried chicken I tend to not get too excited about it. But, once the lines had finally died down around this new location, I decided to give it a go.

I've only gone at lunch time, when they are at their busiest. But I've been amazed at how good their food is. The staff is nice enough. Let's hope that keeps up! They moved customers through the drive thru pretty quickly, too.

But the chicken tenders I got were just amazing. Crispy, not greasy and with just the right amount of heat. I also enjoyed their Cajun fries. I drizzled honey on them as a recommended by a friend and that was a great combo. On another visit I tried their mashed potatoes with Cajun gravy and enjoyed that as well. If there is any negative, it's that with their Cajun flavors, I would have liked things to be a bit spicier, but I realize this is fast food and they spice it up to appeal to the most people.

I can't compare it with other locations, but I will say the coating on the chicken tenders (I got the spicy kind) is better than any other fried chicken joint in town from what I've had."}
{"text":"This location is a joke. The staff are incredibly young and so immature. Instead of trying to clear the food, they're making jokes and laughing while we along with 6 others are waiting for their food and have been for 20 minutes! I ordered the $5 box! It's chicken (your specialty) yet it took 20 minutes?

The young girl who took the order was so rude. A bit more training in customer service wouldn't hurt. The food was ok nothing to brag about but it's Popeyes. But to wait over 20 minutes, I would have liked to have my chicken cooked a bit longer. 

If you're on a time limit, this is not the location for you."}
{"text":"Wow is this place a mess. Doped up kid at the register. Some of their \"boys\" loitering inside with their BMX bikes and horsing around. Dirty! Multiple pieces of chicken on the floor behind the counter. Bad. Bad. Bad."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this location for dinner. I am from  New Orleans and I very familiar with Popeyes's. I ordered the 16 piece family meal (half spicy/half mild) which comes with 3 large sides. One of the side I ordered was red beans and rice. I asked for red beans with rice on the side. The person that took my order said that they don't do that and it already comes with the rice in it. Then, I asked again. Can I have the rice on the side because I have always gotten that way. She said ok, hesitantly. I went to the window, picked up the food and went home. First, the chicken was not separated between spicy/mild. They were all mixed together. I had to look for the mild one so that I could give them to my kids. Then, I open one container for the rice and one for the red beans(large).The red bean container was filled only half way and the rice container was more then half way. I got more rice then beans. Typically, when I order red beans with the rice on the side at other locations, I would get a small container of rice and a large container with 2/3 red beans. Not at this location.  Also, the white meat chicken (wing and breast) was dry. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is right next to Winco, so I will sometimes eat here for lunch before grocery shopping.

This is not a bad place to come to - the food is decent. This last time I had a bad piece of chicken. It wasn't totally raw, but it just seemed off. I was sick for a day. I should have brought it to their attention, but I did not. Because of that I will not rant about it. Crap happens.

I feel old for saying this, but the staff is generally made up of high schoolers which in of itself isn't bad. There is usually 2-3 on break when I am there, and kids will be kids, but if I were the manager I would make sure my employees have a higher level of decorum (mind the language, loudness) in front of paying customers."}
{"text":"We (used to) frequent this location because it's convenient and we really like the Popeyes chain. No more. This is it. Orders are never correct, getting charged for what you order (5 pc) only to get less (3 pc) that is rarely hot or fresh (a smattering of cold fries)... God forbid you want sauce. Don't know what the deal is. Even at lunch time the food is till somehow stale and cold. Shame too, it's in a great place for us. Hope they can get better management or training or something."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. The service is fast and the food was great!!"}
{"text":"First time trying Popeyes ... in a hurry and decided to take the lazy way out of dinner.

Good thing I was headed home anyway... no utensils... no dipping sauce... Cole slaw swimming in sauce... more like cold cabbage soup.

Chicken was moist...  would try again... but not this location."}
{"text":"Awful food and Christian the manager wasn't going to credit order unless I came back with the food. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I love POPEYES I would drive 2 hours to get it... but I don't have to now.  Enough said.... there chicken was extreamly dry and not very hot.....cook less more often..... keep it fresh and hot.... I still don't like that you took cajun rice off the menue... they only place to get it is mesa or the airforce base in goodyear.... looks like I'm driving to kingman time...."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Popeyes for over 30 years, I had high expectations for this location but once again it is just fast food! About 50% of the time the order is wrong in one way or another. Last night of course I checked the order, the wrong side, usually it's a shortage on the piece count. The Cajun rice was, basically just barely flavored white rice! No consistency what so ever, the red beans and rice is not much better and the fries are always lukewarm at best....... no wonder you have  a 2 star rating!!!!!!! I used to drive 2 hours one way just for Popeyes, this place more and more is not worth the 5 minute drive!"}
{"text":"Staff is non attentive and inaccurate it's orders. Almost seems like it an inconvenience. Chicken also not as good as any other location I have been to. 
Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Still amazing. I haven't had Popeye's in years. So good. But the cashier seems to hate her life LOL. That's why three stars. I asked for no salt on the fries (excuse the ignorance because I haven't eaten here in years!!!!) Every question i asked the cashier rolled her eyes and said something like \"they're already battered....ughhh\" etc etc.

I had to hold back...
And just laughed and said okkkay gurl. 

My friend with me even said she's always like that. I cant believe it... she needs to cheer up and relax her face. Not cool! And if you hate your life... do something about it. No one is forcing you to work there."}
{"text":"I will never go to this location again. It took them 10 minutes just to take my order even though there was no one ahead of me. On top of that, they messed up my order even tho I clarified twice and they charged me extra for dipping sauce which shouldn't have happened because what I ordered ALWAYS comes with dipping sauce. Just terrible service overall."}
{"text":"I've tried this location two times and was highly disappointed both time. The food was cold and tasted like processed frozen food. The chicken and shrimp tasted like they used the same batter. Chicken shouldn't taste like shrimp/fish. Plus they always forget something in the meals. I give it two thumbs down and refuse to go there again."}
{"text":"Better than average popeyes, and popeyes is generally pretty darn good. Fast, fresh, juicy and tasty chicken, the sides (fries, rings, mashed, poutine) are all great too."}
{"text":"Worst popeyes ever. Not remotely consistent with the brand. Disgustingly stale, lukewarm chicken, very dry and tough. Dirty location, unpleasant employees. Not at all consistent with the Popeyes brand."}
{"text":"best tasting fried chicken ever. on top of it is 100% halal. sometimes the lines can get long and the wait time may exceed 5 to 10 minutes. but that is nothing when the fresh food comes in front of you."}
{"text":"This review is actually from my husband as he would like to contribute to its ratings. Here goes. 

He listed, \"savory, crunchy, melts in your mouth, tender, not as greasy as KFC, and... Crunchy.\" Yeah, that is why I need to elaborate on this review. Yes, all these qualities all right on. It is a fast food joint, but man, sometimes, you just want those chicken pieces.

What I like about location is their no nonsense, prompt, and good customer service. You say your order and that's what you get. There are probably ten or less tables if you want to eat in. There is a bathroom if you need it, no keys needed. 

For whatever reason, if you're on your way to the cottage country, and you're aching for some chicken, this location is right off of the 404 and Wellington. There will also be an LCBO opening up soon in the same plaza. Fried chicken and beer, sounds like a scene from a Kdrama, eh?"}
{"text":"I love Popeyes but this place had me on my last nerve. how do they run out of chicken?! and cole slaw? the wait for a 4 piece was 27 minutes and there were only 3 other people in there waiting. they get 2 stars because when I did eat my chicken it was delicious."}
{"text":"The chicken is very consistent; always hot and juicy. We are never disappointed when we come here, by the food at least. But they took away the Tuesday special!!! They changed it to a $5 box that comes with a drink, biscuit, and a side with two pieces of chicken. A deal is a deal, none the less. 
But we came by on a regular day, and the ladies behind the counter were very friendly. One lady spoke with my daughter, she was so funny. I can not remember her name though, she was a manager I believe. But the food, no matter what, is always hot and juicy. 
This location is newly remodeled, with a brand new tv inside. We were able to watch some sports while we ate, and the music makes the atmosphere warm and welcoming. The tall tables are my kids favorite place to sit at."}
{"text":"We don't eat here but maybe once a year, so getting home with the wrong order is greatly disappointing. Probably should have gone across the street to KFC for our fried chicken fix. Ordered a family meal and the chosen side was Cajun fries. Got home with rice, 7 pieces (not 8 like I paid for) of chicken and no biscuits. Funny thing is I'm fairly certain they knew the order was wrong when they handed it to me. I ordered my daughter a shrimp box with a side of mashed potatoes. Watched the young boy bag a canister that I assumed was mashed potatoes and stick it in a bag. A woman seemed to be double checking the order (she did a horrible job) as she opened the lid, looked inside, shook her head and walked down a little ways like she was going to change whatever was in the container. Instead she paused and then just walked back to the bag and stuck it in. That tells me she knew it was wrong. So instead of fixing the order she just handed it to me. I tried calling when I got home but it just rang and rang. Basically the food we got was fine, but not what I paid for and it was completely disappointing. I try not to write negative reviews, but the fact that they just plain didn't care isn't ok. If they'd have answered the phone, I probably wouldn't have left this. Buyer beware: check your order before pulling away from the window."}
{"text":"10+ minute wait in drive thru. Get to window we are told we don't have the chicken legs it would be a 10 minute wait we said ok then she said no it will be 15 minutes she was rude from the start. Ok we will just take different chicken pieces. Done. Get home missing 2 parts of our order. Call assistant manager and he was rude saying if we want our money back we have to come back now at 8:30 at night with small children who need to go to bed otherwise to bad. Worst place ever."}
{"text":"I come here only they use the Halal meet here, but service is very slow always waiting for a while. If there is any other Halal Popeyes, I never come here again. I even don't want to one start to them."}
{"text":"The chicken was okay. The rice in the red beans and rice was undercooked slightly. Not good. 
Worst of all the service was slow. Waited at least 20 minutes before ordering. Seems like there wasn't any coordination between the person taking orders and the workers in the back. The one person filling the orders seemed like she was lost. She was mixing up orders. The so-called supervisor was called to make corrections to the order receipts repeatedly. At least the guy taking orders kept his cool trying to take orders from the crush of people waiting in line. 
I should have kept on going to the next service plaza."}
{"text":"Big fan of Popeyes, they're not your practical McDoanld's type fast food chaib. First time trying their food. Cajun Chicken Sandwiches are outstanding! Large sandwich, chrispy flavourful meat.

Contrary to the reviewer below, the dining room was clean, cashier wasn't rude by any means. Long wait to get our food, however everything is made to order and there was a long line of hungry customers so you're completely forgiven. I'll gladly wait 10 mins for my sandwich and have a quality bite than it being rushed. 

I want more Louisiana chicken!"}
{"text":"My roommate dies for this stuff - for me? Not so much. The chicken is better than KFC as far as there is more meat on this chicken - big juicy pieces of white meat. But I'm not a big chicken fan so I ate a leg and had their popcorn shrimp which was unacceptable. OMG it was like 1,000 little pieces that were smaller than a dime. I think I got all batter or something but my roommate says NO they are POPCORN shrimp as if they are suppose to be that small... really? Anyway, it was just ok and I won't go there again unless I have to. Just not my thing but it was fresh and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Slow ass drive-thru with miserable employees that clearly don't have any motivation to do the right thing which is their job in a timely manner. The only reason for the second star is the chicken is decent. Get it together people."}
{"text":"The store is clean this is not an issue, and staff take orders properly. The only real issue with this location is, given the noise from people talking, combined with the radio & television. It is difficult to hear when the staff call out your order. a microphone system or even the count screen this location use to have would be a great improvement towards helping people get there order."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever... order was all messed up..the gravy tasted like stale curry..been to other Popeye n had yum chicken...but this was awful..

Such great location wasted with bad bad service."}
{"text":"Best damn Popeyes I've had in awhile! Staff was super friendly and even made it a point to ask if we wanted sauce. The chicken was fresh and moist. Seriously so freaking good, can't wait to have it again!!"}
{"text":"I freaking LOVE Popeye's. 

As far as fast-food fried chicken, Popeye's wins hands down over KFC, Church's and Mr. Chicken. The breading is crisp and light and the chicken is juicy. I always get the \"spicy\" option. It has a nice little kick to it.

The sides are also pretty damn good. The biscuits are buttery and flaky, the rice n' beans have awesome smoky flavor and the mashed potatoes and gravy are excellent. The cajun gravy is spicy and yummy. 

The \"snack wrap\" is pretty good too. It contains chicken, rice n' beans and cheddar cheese. YUM!

If you have never had Popeye's, you MUST try it. I promise you will like it.

It's just too bad that you have to go to the ghetto to get it.

Although this Carnegie location is OK during the day. I wouldn't be going through here at night though."}
{"text":"For this place to be new, they sure killed their first impression with me. I ordered my favorite pie like I always do when I see a Popeye's but this particular one was very disgusting the pie taste so old that I just threw it on the ground. Never again!"}
{"text":"This is a brand new location and they are off to a great start.  We just enjoyed a great lunch here and we were very impressed.  The counter service was efficient and the food was super fresh and hot.  We were here at peak lunch hour and they seemed to handle the rush in stride.  We will definitely  return."}
{"text":"I just enjoyed another great lunch here at Popeyes.  The food couldn't  have been  any better and the service  was fine.  This place is definitely on my short list of quick and easy lunch spots."}
{"text":"Less greasy and much fresher than other Popeye's locations. They forgot the biscuit I ordered one time. Today they gave spicy rather than regular. Still pleased even if service is so super slow and generally wrong."}
{"text":"Only been here once while passing through. I absolutely love Popeye's chicken and I'm giving this location 5 stars because you can substitute 3 chicken strips for the normal leg and thigh for the Tuesday special ($1.59). No other locations that I know of do this and 3 strips are big and satisfying!  Went through the drive through and the service was fine."}
{"text":"The people working at this location leaves a lot to be desired but they were quick and nice.  Generally, I am not a Popeyes fan but for some reason I was craving them and good thing I was because the chicken was delicious and I mean ever better than KFC and Church's.  Church's chicken has gone down hill taste wise.  The chicken on this night was delicious from first bite to the last and acourse the sides green beans, rice and beans and mash potatoes were delicious as well.  We scored a 11 piece meal with two large sides and six biscuits for $19.99 except I added another large side.  I must say I wasn't before but now I am a fan !"}
{"text":"Although the chicken was fresh, the food did not have much of a flavor. The coleslaw was not great either. The restaurant is clean as always but I've been here more than once now and was not very impressed. I'm a big fan of Popeye's normally but this location for some reason is not hitting the mark. 

I usually go to the new location that opened not too long ago in South Mesa. So far and up until recently their food tasted much better. 

Not sure I will be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Well, my 12 year old saw a Popeyes advertisement  on TV, and this was where he wanted to go for his Birthday lunch. Not a fan of chains, not a fan of fried food. 
BUT DAMN.......I found my new GO TO CHEAT DAY PLACE!!!
Chicken strips were good, the french fries were the bomb, and the mashed potatoes were the freeking bomb!!!! I shop at the WINco behind it, now I'm going to be tempted to stop each week!!!!"}
{"text":"I like Popeyes in general, however this chandler location needs schooling on customer service. 

I walk in 3:30 pm Wednesday afternoon \"today\" and I see I'm the only one in the restaurant, the manager and two other people in the back make eye contact & one of the gentleman with a headset walks towards me. He has a phone in one hand talking to someone about how this person moved and no longer here, blah, blah, blah. I'm staring at him as he's 2feet from me behind the register, and he clearly has no intention of ending his personal phone call. I can assure you I will never be back to this location.  

You better learn some customer service people. !!"}
{"text":"This is the most screwed up place in town. I ordered a  large order of 8 breasts, and 8 legs, extra potatoes and extra gravy on the side. Found inside no extra potatoes, No gravy, DRIED out chicken. You cannot talk to any one that will help at Popeyes. This is like getting food from a 3rd world country. Forget it. Nobody understand how to do anything right. DISASTER PLUS!"}
{"text":"Made a mistake going back tonight. Forgot about how bad service was. Will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"First of all the chicken was sorry as fuck the look like chicken wings and chicken they wasn't spicy when it supposed to have been spicy the chicken look extra extra crispy the mashed potatoes was so nasty you couldn't even finish eating them even the biscuit was kind of off I think they need to shut this Popeyes down and just give up"}
{"text":"Today was a free meal for us provided as an apology from the manager.  About three weeks ago we were on this side of town seeking emergency food.  A long day and it was after my 9 year old's bedtime.  Probably about 9 o'clock.  The service was so horrible I parked my car and walked in to complain.  Instead of offering to make things right I was met with a blank stare.  I basically cussed as I walked out with the wrong order bc it was about 9:20 and my poor kid need to get to sleep so I let her eat the nuggets as we drove home.

Ok so let's move beyond the horrible visit of the past and talk about this visit.

I was ignored by the only person at the counter when I walked in.  The next guy acknowledged us as he was zooming off to the back of the kitchen area.  They were pleasant, not pleased about giving me free food and had to go \"check\" with someone in back.  I actually didn't call to complain so I'd get free food.  I called and complained because if they keep acting that way some hot tempered diner is gonna get belligerent in here.  (like in that one YouTube video lol)  They need to change their ways and actually practice better customer service skills.

I smiled cracked jokes and treated them all very nicely the entire time I was there, I even offered to pay a different in what we ordered and what they were told we were supposed to be given.  They turned it down but seemed to feel better about themselves since I offered to pay.  I'm not poor, I can pay for my food dang it!.

Anyway, food.  Fries and fish were piping hot.  Anything else was heat lamp temperature but still edible.  I am from Louisiana and I've seen a Popeye's funnel thousands of people through in a short amount of time.  I know things can be better than what I've seen at this location lately.  

Will I come here again?  Probably, if I am desperate and they are open.
Really?  I honestly don't seem myself visiting this particular location anytime in the next year.  I just don't have the time for slow service and mediocre food.  

The appearance of the store was mediocre.  Not dirty but definitely not clean.  Crumbs on almost every table and super slow service considering we were one of two customers ordering (drive thru and dining room).  

If i am being completely honest, the visit was kind of depressing.  I remember when Popeye's was a special occasion in my family because we were very poor and didn't go out much to eat.  It always reminds me of my mom, brother and I enjoying chicken that was too hot to even touch but we couldn't help try to eat it before it was cool.  

This Popeye's reminds me of a stripper working far past her prime.  Someone give this chick some clothes and teach her a skill because clearly this ain't working anymore."}
{"text":"Just got back from this popeyes and missing my side order (mashed potatoes)!  Kind of a boring meal with no side, not to mention having paid for potatoes.  The chicken was just OK since I've been to other Popeye's and it was great.  I don't know what it is about this location, but they need some help.  Might have to start going to the one on Broadway."}
{"text":"This is not Popeyes chicken at all. The chicken is small and dry. The original Popeyes chicken is huge with lot of juice. I used to work at churches when I was a kid so I know how it is. The chicken nugget is a joke. You would feel like you got rip off. I really don't recommend this place. You can get much tastier chicken in a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Only come here on Tuesdays! Two pieces (leg and thigh) for just 99 cents! Service is VERY slow even if they are not busy! If they are busy, then you better bring a book along with you or a full battery on your phone to pass the time! 

IF they dont mess up your order then it usually is worth the wait. But you would think the wait would be quick since you can see all of the chicken that is cooked right in front of you! 

So in conclusion, Church's Chicken (kitty corner to these guys) is slightly better servicewise. Don't get me wrong. I like both these chicken places but sometimes, good service goes a long way."}
{"text":"Bad service. Girl in the drive thru had such an attitude, she almost dropped my food on the ground since I hadn't grabbed the bag yet."}
{"text":"Slow Service=Slow Staff, girl forgot about our order, then gave us an Incorrect Order but try to make it up and also by giving us lots of incorrect chicken that we did not order!, Broken Soda Machine=No Carbonated Soft Drinks, No Air Flow, Lots of irate Customers, 45 minute wait for take-out, and last but not least, Soggy \"fresh\" fries....


that about sums it up."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. This Popeyes sucks, and is the worst part of my vacation. The employees are more concerned about closing then they are well paying customers. My mother ordered at 10:40 and they close at 11. After about thirty minutes of waiting in line AND PAYING for the order at 11pm they tell us they do not have our food because we did not order at the beginning. Why would you charge somebody \"who didn't order\". They gave the order to another person. I guess the manager Liz gave us a refund but it did not compensate for the time wasted on our vacation. They showed no empathy and did not want to even try to make our order so they didn't have to reclean and get our faster. If that's your manager not helping customers, then you're losing a plethora of revenue. This Popeyes sucks, if you want food DONT GO HERE. They handle money and touch food which is also a violation as well. They were very rude and hostile. No compensation, no sorrow just all cashiers, food prep and managers ready to get home early. You can even check cameras on how they roll there eyes and how my mom NOT ONCE give them the piece of mind they deserve. Especially after a manager saying \"I DONT CARE\" when we payed, after a lot of attitude we got refund. Check CCTV, cameras will see the way they even slam the doors closed to keep people out; minutes prior from closing. Mind you there was about seven people after my mom, and they turned them away. You guys should fix this and relate to all reviews stated here. Don't work customer service and food if you're miserable, no need to make customers be the same as you."}
{"text":"WTF, I give up on every single Popeyes! They can't get your order right and if they do......well they're probably out of something or you need to wait 20 minutes for it! I'm confused at how a franchise of this size doesn't have better systems in place?? Do yourself and anyone you know and tell them not to give these guys any of your time or money."}
{"text":"Bought 2/. 3piece chicken tender dinners today around 3:30 pm. We ate the meal around 5:00 pm.  My review is worse than negative. Chicken looked awesome and had a crunchy crust. The chicken inside was not even edible for dogs ,  dry, extremely tough and not even suitable for the garbage. Just an all around BAD!!!!!  No joke terrible.  Popeyes never again.    Store on 90th street    In Scottsdale , Az.   P.S. cole slaw great"}
{"text":"With this newly opened Popeye's location the management needs a lesson in customer service. After my first visit Saturday night the place was busy but is no excuse for incomplete orders. After I got home I realized my order was incomplete and I quickly called to let them know, I was given a code for me to get what was missing on my next visit.  Fast forward today when I returned but forgot to bring the code with me. The person who stated he was above the manager told me he could not and would not replace my item without the code. Now we're not talking about national security and the code is critical!! This manager person was argumentative and condescending and kept telling me, \"it's their policy\" and I said why isn't it \"their policy\" to guarantee orders are correct!!! So I'm out money for an order I should've received in the first place.  I'll see what kind of customer service I'll get from the higher ups who are higher than this person who is higher than the store manager as this mofo kept reiterating...."}
{"text":"We arrive at 10:15pm with 2 cars in front of us ordering food for us to get to the intercom for an automated voice to say we are closed and we can't make an order but the 2 cars in front get food and we get trapped behind the car waiting for there food for an additional 15 minutes which at this point is 10:33pm and the girl at the drive thru  laughing and talking to the person trying to get out of the line if they wouldn't let us order to only give us a rude attitude at the window. 08/17/2018"}
{"text":"First of all, the food was pretty good. The chicken was not soaked in grease, the Cole slaw was good and the biscuit was excellent. I was disappointed that they don't have sandwiches and thought almost $7 for 3 pieces of chicken (2 wings!) was high, especially for lunch. The service is SLOW  and unfriendly. Better than KFC but not much."}
{"text":"Who can say no to fried chicken!?! I know I can't! 

This location opened about a week ago and it's already very busy. 

Went in to grab take out for myself and my husband & even though it was pretty busy (inside the restaurant and in drive thru) I was in and out of there in about 5 min! I placed my order and by the time I got my drinks, they called my name. Cool, seeing I was in a hurry!

The food was super hot and fresh, everything was delicious! I am so glad they opened at this location and hope they'll open one in NE Mesa too! The more the merrier, yes?! 

Popeye's has been my favorite fried chicken restaurant for years but some of their locations have disappointed me in the past. If this location continues to serve their chicken & biscuits as hot and fresh as they did today, they will have people pouring in from everywhere so keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Me and my daughter came to this location right after it was opened. We had a big order and was excited about it. So when we got to the window they shoved the order out immediately so we took it. But the two employees were kind of laughing and lo and behold when we got home with the order it was old and stale chicken. It completely turned me off forever for the franchise because it had always been great prior. I have read a couple other posts and I kind of feel bad that people yammer because fast food isn't fast enough, but believe me! If I have to wait longer for fresh and quality...I'll wait every time! So you people that don't want to wait 5 minutes? I'd much rather have the wait time and have good chicken."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple of times but tonight was very disappointed.  I ordered a $20 holiday feast (they should rename it to snack) which I thought would feed my family of 4.  It would have if the chicken pieces were not very tiny!  I felt like instead of chicken I was eating quail.  I wasn't going to post a review but I really do feel I was ripped off and let others know do not go here if you are hungry. I will still go to Popeyes but not this location!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru at about 10:15pm. I ordered a 5 piece tenders with fries. Was told there would be a 5 minute wait for the tenders, which I was fine with. Parked in the front and the person behind me parked next to me. When the worker came out he asked, \"you had the 5 piece right?\" I said \"yes\". He handed me my food then started to walk to the other car, he suddenly turns around and says \"oops, that's the 3 piece!\". So he switches bags. I should've checked before leaving but unfortunately, I decided to wait til I got home to check. Was given a 3 piece tender with macaroni and cheese. At this point, it's already 10:40 and I'm not about to get back into my car and drive back to the store. So I decide to call and let them know, literally called 4 times and it just rang and rang with no answers."}
{"text":"Filthy chicken with loads of fat not properly cleaned. Too oily oozing out from the crispy crumb coating. FRIES are chewy and oily. Washrooms are filthy and not serviced periodically. Highly dont recommend this chain."}
{"text":"I came here the other day to try the waffle chicken. It was chicken battered in waffle batter and fried. I must say it was really good. I think it may be a limited time promotion so I recommend trying it while it's around.

This location is very busy around dinner time so be prepared for a wait."}
{"text":"Disgusting!

I like Popeye's Chicken; its a unique spin on (fast) Chicken for this area of Pittsburgh....

**I am writing a review for THIS location, however... and its not good.**

Every time we ordered something the rude kid at the counter said \"hold on, lemme see if we got any left\"

The self-serve Soda station (where the condiments, lids, straws and napkins were located) was an absolute mess.   Spills, trash, and there were no napkins in either napkin holder and they were out of lids.

The kids behind the counter were more concerned with talk of football amongst each other than waiting on my husband and myself.

The Manager on duty was nothing more than a kid, himself, and he was acting just the same as the others and made NO attempt to actually manage his staff.

We didn't get the correct order (and we were the only ones there!).
Some of my chicken was undercooked.
Most of my husband's meal was dried out (like it had been sitting for hours).
There was NO hot water in the bathroom when I went to wash my hands after eating (dang chicken residue--lol); I asked my husband about the men's room and there wasn't any hot water in there either.


PROS:  
its located, conveniently, on Rt. 22 in Monroeville (the last remaining location in our area).

CONS:
everything else"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service! Please be advised, do not go there unless you want to waste your time, money and the opportunity to eat good food. STAY AWAY!!"}
{"text":"Fucking disgusting, I just went there yesterday, their staff was so rude. They gave me my combo meal in the smallest basket they had. All other popeyes locations are better than this one where they gove you the 8$ combo in boxes. They give it to you like that so they can fill less and it looks like alot. I called them to complain and they told me I could only get 3 ounces of fries, so like 6-10 fries in total. Worst place ever, worst location in Scarborough never going back even if its the last thing open. I suggest if you actually want what your paying for go to any other location in Scarborough"}
{"text":"Sandra Chancy was the manager on duty when my husband and I went for a QUICK dinner.  He went inside to order because the drive thru was backed up to the road.  25 mins later he was told it would be just a minute!  Nope!  He would've left, but already paid and at this point was curious how much longer this was going to take for 2 of the two piece meals! 37 minutes waiting!!!!!  NOT WORTH THE WAIT!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I never knew what \"fried chicken was\" till i moved to America... I actually love it specially the crunchiness of the \"skin\" 
I like the Popeyes by Sunset and Decatur.
The staff are very pleasant and helpful! Always give me 3 mns of laugh when i go there :)
restaurant is clean, on tuesdays they are always busy busy since they offer the $1.69 for 2 pieces of chicken leg and thigh 
I can't resist their Biscuits! always freshly baked!

sometime eating simple is good.
By the way when i went to New Orleans, their Popeye wasn't has good as this location !!! so go go Popeye Vegas! you guys are the best"}
{"text":"The most disgusting experience I've ever had at any restaurant in my life. While waiting 20 minutes for French fries, the entire dining room g9t to listen to 2 employees argue over who was going to be forced to stay past their shift. The reason one employee was going to have to stay, is because the cook was in the kitchen in full view of everyone, vomiting into a garbage can while everyone he just handled and cooked food for, had the pleasure of hearing and seeing him do this. Thank God the service was so horrible and my fries took so long, because had I gotten my food sooner I would've been one of the unlucky patrons that would have ingested this disease/germ plagued food. I immediately demanded a refund, no one apologized, and I left. I couldn't help but to feel sorry for everyone in the drive thru who was now eating food made by someone who had no business handling food. I will never eat here again, the place is always dirty, tables are always a mess. The employees are awful, they act like they are doing you a favor by giving you $10 chicken nuggets. Don't eat here unless your looking for food poisoning. Totally unsafe and disgusting. Shame on you popeyes for endangering the welfare of the public because your manager is too lazy to run a fryer. Yuck, NEVER again!!!"}
{"text":"They are still my numero uno spot for delicious fast food style fried chicken! This is just an update review and am very pleased to exclaim this owner takes pride in his quality of food. Hot,crispy & fresh chicken is always good! The side items like biscuits, fries, red beans &rice, Mac n cheese, coleslaw, mashed potatoes & corn on the cob all real good. Keep up the great job!"}
{"text":"The food is great, the manager is beyond nice, but the rest of the staff is underwhelming. I've always felt bad because I see the manager working hard and not receiving much help. Hope to see an improvement soon!"}
{"text":"This location opened about 4 months ago and I've dined in twice & been through the drive through about 5 times.  Never encountered a problem dining in, wait time is on the slower side, but staff friendliness makes up for it.  Drive through 3/5 times was quick & easy. 2 times I had to wait about 10 minutes each time.  I love Popeyes. I highly recommend spicy chicken tenders w/ gravy & biscuits! It's not healthy, but it's yummy."}
{"text":"Deliciously crispy, juicy, well-seasoned fried chicken (you can choose mild or spicy) that comes out fast and hot. They marinate their chicken (you can actually see the spices under the skin when you take it off) then hand-batter and bread it in their Southern crispy coating. My favorite sides are the buttery and moist buttermilk biscuits, crunchy mayonaise based coleslaw and the mashed potatoes with cajun gravy (which has bits of smoked meat in it). 

Efficient staff, not the warmest, but they do check up on you to make sure everything is good. Clean, roomy dining area and a small parking lot."}
{"text":"Popeyes Chicken is our go to fast food fried chicken place. More flavorful than KFC, chicken is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Definitely order your chicken spicy (it's actually pretty mild in heat). I ordered their 5 wing platter with coleslaw, mashed potatoes with gravy, a buttermilk biscuit and large drink ($8.49). They were out so they had to make a fresh batch just for me. YAY! Piping hot fresh food! I ordered an extra leg ($1.99) and thigh ($2.59) and shared everything with my hubby. Sizes at this location are smaller than I'm used to hence the 3 stars instead of 4. No fast food place can beat their gravy which has little pieces of smoked meat in it, oh sooo delicious . Coleslaw is solid and biscuit is buttery. If you're on a tight budget they have daily lunch specials ($3.29-$4.99) that you can upgrade to a combo for $1.25 (see the pic). One thing missing from the Canadian franchises is their dirty rice awww."}
{"text":"Just throw the whole staff away! This is a chicken restaurant and these fools NEVER HAVE CHICKEN READY! I am too through. *sigh*"}
{"text":"You want chicken that is finger licking. Then this west coast Louisiana' s kitchen style chicken is the place to be. A piece of Louisiana in every single meal! All of our Popeye's menu items come with a special flair of Southern style preparation and cooking all their own. Bonifide Chicken that has been marinated for at least 12 hours, then hand battered with a bold of flavor. Mild or Spicy are the options to choose from. Same options with their all white meat tasty tenders. Not a fan of chicken or want to switch it up Louisiana's also has signature seafood items from popcorn shrimp, butterfly shrimp, and filets. The fun does not end there. The amazing side dishes Cole Slaw, Beans & Rice, Cajun Fries,  Corn on the Cob, Jambalaya Potatoes, Green Beans and Mighty Tasty Buttermilk Biscuits. 
If you're on a diet they have living well items that are 350 calories or less. 
My experience at this location has always been drive thru. They are fast, friendly and my food is always great. Exterior is clean and plenty of parking.  

Now if you need a sweet treat then be sure to grab an apple pie that is straight out of the oven type of taste."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this restaurant. I went at 11:45am. I went through the drive through and ordered off the menu with no special requests. There were no cars in line. I was told to pull over and wait. It took almost 10 minutes for them to bring my food. I drove to my office across the street and of course the  food was cold! Don't go here. The staff is slooooow. Go to one of the other restaurants within a block of this place."}
{"text":"The drive-thru is a gamble. I've been here 5 times now and the biggest complaint is that they never include or even offer dipping sauces. I know a lot of companies have gone to a policy of not including sauces unless you ask, but the Wild Pepper Tenderloins adverts ALL (in-store, on the drive-thru menu, and online) specifically mention that the new \"Red Hot Honey Dipping Sauce\" is a feature of the meal. Minor gripe, but it would be nice not to have to keep your own checklist of what they claim is part of the meal...
Tonight. we wanted an extra side of Mac & Cheese and we didn't get it. We always get the box meals and they usually put up to two sides inside the boxes. So, we did check in the bag but short of pulling everything out and opening each box we gave them the benefit of the doubt and saved our disappointment until we got all the way home.
Still... one real screw up out of 5 visits isn't why they get just one star from me. No, they earned one star for the way they acted when we drove all the way back and asked for what we paid for. This is where I got a real glimpse of the heart of their issues. Between the two people at the counter and the young guy that seemed to be acting like a manager, they seemed completely dumbfounded that we wanted what we paid for and watching them try to work out what was going on reminded me of a scene from the 3 Stooges.

After writing all this, I'm going to give them an extra pity-star. There rating is low enough already and I can see that their issue stems from a lack of training in management. If you're going to screw up a lot then you better be good at handling the backlash and they aren't. Lucky for them they are the only decent chicken/seafood place between Central and 51st Ave."}
{"text":"amazing gravy, one of a kind!! great customer service, food ready in less than 15 mins.  and it's Halal"}
{"text":"4 Stars only cuz I love Popeyes. Being from states you never get Halal popeyes here.  Therefore I have nothing to compare it to.  According to locals I know, say the service is really poor.  I have been here couple of times, I haven't noticed anything.  prices and portions are high.  3 pcs cost about $6-$8 with tax.  I think that's high for the size of chicken.  but it is what it is!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I drive 50 miles each way to get to this Popeye's since we love the Chicken. During the trip we try to guess just what the problem will be on that trip, (no mild Chicken, no Chicken at all, having to wait 20 minutes in a line of 3 people just to order). One would think that we would never go back since the service can be so bad, I guess we just can't wait to see what will happen next! We really do love the Chicken and most times even if we have to wait for it we enjoy it, just don't go to this location expecting world class service.

THIS LOCATION IS NOW CLOSED!"}
{"text":"Always bad service so tonight I wait about 5 -10 mins after getting to the speaker box in the drive thru after being told to give them a min to order 
I make a order an I was told there is only chicken breast left in mild so I said well are you cooking more what's the wait time an it's 15 mins so yeah 30 mins later still here an had to come park my car in front of the restaurant with 2 other cars that had to do the same thing crazy hate it not even that busy so I really don't understand"}
{"text":"ill never go back to this location ever again i asked for shirmp and chicken the drive through, which they make and they denied that they could do that. so i go inside ask for a manager and order three 2 peice chicken and 1/4 pound of shrimp. I wasnt even charged for two of the shrimps and never received them so i came back after realizing this and claimed i never ordered it like i said three of the EXACT same thing......um hello common sense is dead with this new deadbeat generation"}
{"text":"I've been here several times.  I wish they would come down a little on the menu but they never let you down.  You always get what you pay for at this and some of the other location in the area.  I usually buy the 5 piece chicken strips & 1/2 dozen biscuits for a little under 10.00.  Ask for hot sauce and butter for the biscuits, yummy."}
{"text":"I visited this location for lunch while working in the area. When I walked in I noticed that they had music Inside the restaurant but also outside which did not bother to me I enjoy that type of Cajun music because it sounds kind of like Latin music. I went up to the counter and I order the 2-piece combo because after I saw the prices I didn't want to spend more than $8 for lunch and I thought that the 2-piece combo might fill me up. I got my order promptly and the chicken leg was pretty dried out and really small, I don't know where they get their chickens but they need to feed them more. The second piece which was a thigh was very hot but extremely dried out with a lot of breading which is not an issue because I like that. But dried out chicken was not great. The side dish which was red beans and rice was tasty but how much could read beans and white rice cost to make that they give you a container that's probably a 1/4 of a cup large. The total cost of my lunch came out to $7.70 for 2 dried out pieces of chicken and a tablespoon of red beans and rice. I am a very frugal person but I will pay if the food is worth it as far as taste and quantity, but in my opinion that meal was a $2.99 meal at the most. You can get a two piece combo at Church's for much much less and the quality in my opinion is much better. I would have given it only one star but I added a star because the staff were very nice and seemingly efficient. They do greet every person that comes in with the ring of a bell and all staff in unison saying \"welcome back to Popeyes!\", unfortunately they will never welcome me back again."}
{"text":"Great to have a nearby Popeye's as for years we have been limited to the great tasting chicken. Food is always hot and fresh. Along with a meal deal for the family. The drive through moves fast as well as the pickup counter. Either way you will get in and out. The customer service is hit or miss. It seems the women who work there are always happy. The men seem to kind of hard/rude at times but I won't let them stop me from swinging by. Glad to have them in the neighboorhood."}
{"text":"Good service and the best chicken anywhere.
 The cashier was very friendly as I changed my mind a couple of times, she was friendly and supportive, no idea why the low ratings with others, for me I will come back again"}
{"text":"As soon as you enter the store u get a delicious smell of fried chicken. The food is very delicious and customer service is great. They have daily specials which I love but my favorite is Wednesday because they have there chicken burger for less then $5 and with only a $1.25 drink and frise added it's something reach over too. I do have one problem, the chicken is really gressey, I think they should have something to obsorve the oil."}
{"text":"Never like coming here. Staff is pretty rude and I have found they use cheaper quality chicken. Rather drive 5 more minutes to go to another Popeyes. Area is sketchy though too, be careful"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Fried Chicken and a major fan of Popeye's but this location is a bad representation of the brand. Fast, friendly service is not what you will receive. Last night around 7:30 pm was my first visit and officially my last. I wish I read the reviews before I walked in to check in. 

My experience was dining. I was NOT greeted. I had a cashier stand at the register starring at me. They had barely anything ready. What I mean by this is if you wanted spicy chicken they barely had any pieces left. My order consisted of 3 wings and one chicken breast. They had the three wings and a drumstick. 15 min wait for the breast. They did not even have a mild breast. They did not even have any tenders available. Basically they had NO chicken. I chose to wait. In staring at the staff there was one person cooking the staff the rest of the employees were talking among each other. This includes the manager on a personal level. 

The restaurant was clean and in order. Plenty of utensils. However, when my food was ready and dropped under the heater the employees who are assigned to package the food were too busy talking they did not notice. I had to walk up and ask for my food. I was not even given a number like most restaurants who will bring you your food."}
{"text":"Staff are the laziest bunch of losers I've ever seen. Took thirty minutes tonight for my husband to get through the drive through and there were only three cars ahead of him and then the retard working the register couldn't even be remember the sauce after my husband told him twice. And these kids think the deserve 15 dollars an hour. At this location, the dumbasses they have working here don't even deserve 8 dollars. This isn't our first problem at this location and we won't be back. Management needs to step in and do something about their lazy workers. See ya Popeyes! Your chicken isn't that good!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why so many people are complaining. The staff here is so nice. They have never messed my order up and the food is always hot. I go here often during the evening and every time my food is delicious. They keep the dining room clean and are friendly to everyone. I have witnessed customers being rude to the staff but they never broke. They are friendly each time."}
{"text":"Man this chicken is great.

This rating is not to compare this fast food to gourmet chicken, but to other fast food chicken restaurants 

The chicken is always juicy, hot, and delicious. I usually go there on Tuesdays for the great deals.

The only reason I wouldn't leave a perfect score is the fact that something is always missing. One time I went they didn't have honey for my biscuits, very disappointing. Next time, there was no spicy. 

Apart from that the chicken was very good so they deserve the stars for the taste. I can't demerit them too much for running out so close to closing."}
{"text":"ALWAYS out of different things on the menu.  Last three times I've been there they were out of Cajun fries, onion rings and then PO boy bread!  How the heck do you run out of PO Boy bread by 1 PM on a Saturday?   They open at 10 and close at 11....they still have 10 hours of business. That's a lot of time to not be able to serve one of the main things on your menu.  Will not return here again. Waste of time. My guess is if I were to go again, they'd be out of chicken by 11 am."}
{"text":"Awful food.  Dry chicken.  Rude staff.  All in all a write off.  I was looking forward to trying it.  
It even took a while to get served as the staff were talking about their lives outside work."}
{"text":"I've had Popeyes before and it was good.  I tried this particular location once and was very disappointed.  The chicken strips were so tiny!  Talk about cheap!"}
{"text":"Friendly employees, you've gotta eat  at the restaurant. Its slop bye the time you get home."}
{"text":"Bad service takes them about 1 hour just to get my food.  They should get there shit together and be prepared for the amount of people coming."}
{"text":"First off, I visited this establishment by using the drive-thru. Hence,  I expected speedy service at a FAST FOOD place, however,  it took over 30 minutes for me to get to the window to pay.  There were only 2 cars ahead of me! 
I asked the woman at the window if they were always this slow (after I got my food,  of course), and her reply was \"We're really busy.\"  What has happened to pleasing the customer?  A simple acknowledgement of the time I wasted in line by saying something along the lines of \"I'm sorry, we're very busy,\" would have made such a better impression.  Nope,  not returning."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 0 stars 
Employees and supervisors here hate their jobs and take it out on customers just left their drive through and the supervisor was so rude over the intercom. The girl at the window was stingy with the little cheap sauces. I have 4 biscuits what am I going to do with one honey ? How does that make sense? I have 9 pieces of chicken what am I going to do with 2 hot sauces ? Last time I came they gave me 2 scraps and a crumb for chicken tenders. I have the video to prove it. I decided to give them a chance again because my dad loves their chicken for dinner and yeah this is the last straw. If they weren't so rude and mean I might come back but they're horrible. The food isn't even that great"}
{"text":"Sigh. As many of you guys reading this review, we all know, popeye's food is GOOD! It's just this location never get my orders right!! 
How could you fill a box of \"surf and turf\" with just butterfly shrimps?! Where's the \"turf\" ??
How could you put a breast and a wing, when I clearly asked for Two Thighs??  WHY?!

Location on Craig is much better when it comes to dishing out correct food, and their employees care slightly more than folks at this Durango location.

Sigh.... all I wanted as some dang chicken tenders with my shrimp :S"}
{"text":"Service was kind of slow but their customer service was great. I went through the drive thru and ordered the bonafide big box for $5 and when I pulled up to the window to pay, the drive thru lady was very nice and so I waited for my meal. More cars started getting into the drive thru so the drive thru lady politely asked if I can park in the front and they'll deliver the food to me once it's ready. For a location that's new I didn't mind the slow service but the customer service was top notch. If this Popeyes can work on speeding up the service I can definitely see it being successful."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru and was told to wait in the parking lot for my ghost pepper wings. Waited 12 minutes before I went inside and asked about it. The lady said, \"Oh yeah, here...\" are you kidding me?! Now all my other food is cold because of their laziness and lack of bringing them out as promised. I was also not given any silverware to eat my sides, ranch (even though it's detailed on the receipt!) or napkins. The worker didn't seem to care at all or offer any compensation for the poor experience. I tried to call and speak to manager and no one picked up the phone. Horrible experience!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to grab a quick bite from here last night. This was the only food we ate that we ate of the same thing. My wife was sick last night. My little one woke up throwing up and so did I. Sadly I'm writing this review from the toilet as I see this is how I'm spending my day."}
{"text":"Come on man, you have three things you need to cook - chicken and fries and biscuits... I've been waiting 15 minutes for French fries, I'm glad they're fresh but it appears that they forgot about me out in the parking lot"}
{"text":"Cashier doesn't know what she is doing. Asked for 2 pieces of chicken and a drink and she couldn't even figure out the price... How hard is it just to punch some order into the register?!?!?
Also they don't have the tuesday special in this store per cashier. Why not? Every other Popeyes that I've been got the Tuesday special."}
{"text":"After screwing up my order and charging me 30 instead of 5 for the 9 tender pieces. I dont get how you thought it was a party size tray for one person. Will not be coming back. Your manager was VERY rude and was not listening to anything I said."}
{"text":"I've had Pop-Eye's before and survived, but this was downright awful.

Had the #11 Shrimp & Fish. For $7.99, the portion came with a handful of shrimp and 1 piece of fish. Not very generous.  The shrimp was good but I think they caught the carp from the lake behind my house and battered in their kitchen. It left the worst after-taste in my mouth for a good five minutes. Terrible, just terrible. Had to throw it away and head out to McDonald's to satisfy my appetite. Nice knowing you Pop-Eye's! Thanks for blocking off and kicking out the only good Thai food in the area, as well."}
{"text":"Great Chicken. The breading is tasty. The biscuits are addictive. The tea is good and I usually dont  do tea. The mashed taters great. The staff and lady manager there were very nice for a fast food place. Not what you would expect in a GOOD way"}
{"text":"I love Popeyes and is my preference over KFC and poultry chains. This is the worst and most horrible location over and over again!!! Chicken is never ready to order for a chain that is mainly for it!!! Multiple occasions were a disaster and I've made attempts to possibly have a different experience because the is the closest location to me. I went for a lunch break one day in particular and it took over 45 mins for 2 basic chicken combo orders to be given because no chicken was readily available in their warmer or no beans ready! I was the only person in line and it took them 15mins to acknowledge me and another 5 to even take my order with a employee thinking the operations herself was in disbelief but thought it was funny to laugh about. Unprofessional and bad representation to even feel sanitary to eat there with their bad inefficient work ethics. A manger was on site as well who came onto the floor and couldn't care to assist in proper work flow!!! Horrible service and inadequate service for a \"fast food chain\"! And forget about drive thru because for basic mild leg and thigh value packs almost always have a wait!!! Eliminates those employees with an attitude that is a disservice to the company and assign them somewhere they don't need to deal with customer service or get better management!!! And NO I don't expect 5star service but their chicken is in a freakin warmer for goodness sakes keep up with demand!!!!"}
{"text":"I waited 20 minutes for something simple. I thought I learned my lesson the last time I came here. It is connected to a glass station but when you go inside it kind of gives off a unclean feeling.

Its your average fast-food place. Slow service, young high school students... the food could be better but it takes training I guess."}
{"text":"I've been visiting this Popeyes Chicken for lunch ever since they opened.  It's right next to Grazie Ristorante which I've never actually been to because for lunch Popeyes is the destination.  

I've seen my co-worker eat Popeyes 5 DAYS straight because his family went on a vacation.  I had a routine for 6 months to get Popeyes every Tuesday even during snow storms.

I LOVE Popeyes because of their ability to combine a few strengths at least in my perspective.  Crispy & Spicy Chicken, Consistent Buttermilk Biscuit, Cajun Spiced Fries, Halal, Quick and Affordable Tuesday Special!

It's not the healthiest thing in the world but then if you know what I've eaten before and my diet then it's JUST another edible meal for me.  

This specific Popeyes is a bit hidden and isolated from other restaurants except Grazie and Vinnie so when you see the parking lot, then you can make an educated guess how many people will be lining up to order lunch so you can decide for a dine-in or take-out."}
{"text":"These pictures says it all and no I didn't order dark meat. This place is utter disgusting and have poor customer service. I repeat do not buy here. Old chicken and had hair in the food. The employees do not wear hair nets when preparing food"}
{"text":"I have been disappointed with these guys since they have opened.  Twice now they have run out of menu items when I have come through the drive through."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst Popeyes franchise I've ever been to. Multi-leveled incompetence all across the board from the manager to the fry cooks. Several visits to this establishment (shame on me), have shown that they either don't care about filling the order correctly or they are too incompetent to do so.  Ask for mild they give you spicy, ask for spicy chicken they give you a wrap. Not to mention the one time I used my credit card instead of cash(which I rarely do), and my card number is compromised. I'm over this place and I've expressed my concern to their corporate office. Franchise stores like this one will tarnish the image of the company."}
{"text":"Manager is rude, very condescending. Not customer friendly at all."}
{"text":"Worst fast food meal ever. I ordered a shrimp and fish with cole slaw, the shrimp was hard as a rock as was the fish. The slaw was ok as well as the bread, the rest tasted like over fried dough with a lot of cayenne pepper. I couldn't eat it, and to top all this off no sauce was given, no tarter or cocktail sauce really? Never going back, to have to wait 10 minutes for food like that is absurd. The food must have sat under the heat lamp all day."}
{"text":"Pretty bad experience 

Ordered food on a combo paid extra for poutine and after they took my money the service went downhill

They forgot my drink and when I asked rather than just check my receipt and pour it .... the girl asks 3 different people about if I ordered one 

Then they poured the wrong drink 

The order took longer than it really should and it was cold when I sat to eat directly across from it 

Poutine was the worse poutine Canada has to offer .... really bad .... cold and dreadful gravy 

Then.... no fork in the bag, go up for one and I'm given a spork instead (spoon fork) tiniest prongs so when you try get a fry it just slices it in 2"}
{"text":"I really like Popeyes. But today not so happy with service. The guy at the cash is more focus on watching the soccer game than taking my order. I asked to get 10pcs dark, when I saw my receipt, I was charged differently. He then told me they don't have any special pricing for that anymore. It would have been nice to know that! If I knew, I would have got something else. I guess, I won't be going to this location anymore!"}
{"text":"I would give zero starts if I could.  We've ordered three times in the last few months and they have messed something up EVERY time.  The first two times we blamed it on the fact that we went through the drive-thru.   This visit we went inside.  Tonight's debacle was the worst - entire order was wrong.  We live too far away to return it so we won't be back.  How difficult is it to split an 8 piece dinner between hot and mild and add two extra legs hot and two extra legs mild?  We received all 6 legs, 3 thighs hot, while all breasts and wings were mild.  Large potatoes with gravy on the side, had gravy mixed in.   Last time we ordered a large rice and received fries instead.  I understand good help is hard to find, but this location needs to find some people who take pride in their work really fast or I'm sure they won't be open long."}
{"text":"Too bad one can't award negative stars.  I took my son here for dinner and he ordered the shrimp. He said it tasted like the bottom of the fryer and it was cold.  I noticed a fowl smell and told him to stop eating it. Five minutes later he was profusely vomiting. The staff has a strange demeanor about them.  I'm not sure about that place.  I will not return there.  There are no vegan options even though google may say the fries are.  These folks cook the fries in the same oil they cook the \"shrimp\" and \"chicken\" in.  Yikes!"}
{"text":"Beware of the surrounding of the area this location of Popeyes is in, it is in a pretty sketchy area full of thugs and dangerous people and even crackheads."}
{"text":"The drive through takes longer than any other fast food restaurant in Las Vegas. Either they need more staff or a better system in place. The term \"Louisiana Fast\" does NOT apply here. I will however say that the food is good. It just takes forever to get it. They should close the drive through and take phone orders instead."}
{"text":"I,  like many other posters, had mutiple issues with this location.   I finally had been tortured enough and reached out to corporate.  I like Popeyes, I want them to succeed.   I was given a complimentary meal and the food and transaction were near flawless.  My first job was in fast food and the number one thing I was taught is that without customers, you don't have a job.  For many, this is their first job and will impact what type of employee they will be forever.  Popeyes has some responsibility to ensure they are creating good employees not indifferent, waiting for the dream job before they behave like good employees."}
{"text":"This is the Popeye's location that is just off the west side of Rainbow and Badura. It is actually attached to a gas station. It is a fairly small location, with not much in the way of in room seating. This was definitely built as a grab-and-go in mind.

I am not a huge fried chicken guy, but I did enjoy grabbing some Popeye's on occasion when I lived over by their Windmill and LV Blvd location. Unfortunately, this location is not nearly as good as that one.

For one, the service is painfully slow. I mean like molasses rolling uphill in the winter time slow. They have a pretty good special on Tuesdays where you can get a two piece combo of chicken(1 leg, 1 thigh) for $1.29! This only seems to make wait times worse. Tonight I only had 2 cars in front of me and it took almost 15 minutes to get to the window! Damn!

When we finally got to the window, the young man was nice and confirmed our order. Only thing that bugged me was I got \"dude-man-bro'ed\". I don't expect 5 star, 5 diamond service at Popeye's, but it does come across as a bit too casual. He meant well, though.

The chicken was a bit greasier than I remembered, even by fast food fried chicken standards.

Even though this was a bit of a disappointing experience, I will give Popeye's another shot again in the future. When they have their stuff together it can be a tasty product at a good price.

Just not tonight.

2 stars."}
{"text":"Tonight while ordering food for our family my husband was asked to pull to the Thank You Sign And Wait. You could not understand the lady at the drive through first of all. Laughing and joking around. To the left of us my husband notices one of the Popeyes employee spiting and having his hand in his pants. Disgusting!!! We pulled around and asked for a refund!!! Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location, the employees were nice and quick to serve me, the restaurant was always clean and organized, and there were never screw-ups with my orders. They weren't always packed, but at least you know everything is freshly made right in front of you. I'm so glad they opened a Popeyes so close to me and they also deliver! For delivery: I don't know how far their radius is where they'll deliver or not, but soon I'll try their delivery service to see if it keeps up with their in-store review."}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all costs. They were out of almost all sides, chicken was coming back from other guest raw.. run by amateurs

The manager really didn't care and the counter register person was nice but unapologetic for all the issue. We got a refund and went to browns chicken where they actually wanted our business.  Browns was out of coleslaw but promptly made a fresh batch."}
{"text":"For lunch yesterday, ordered the 8 pc family meal which came with a large side and 4 biscuits. Again, fried chicken is crispy not oily and you can have it mild, spicy, or half mild and half spicy. Staff was quick and friendly. Happy eats!"}
{"text":"Genuinely love Popeyes chicken far and above KFC but this particular location has the absolute worst customer service!!! They have yet to get my order correct, even after I have asked about items on the order. They also seem to be the only location that doesn't have mac and cheese, What The F**k?!?"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite chicken place.  I find their batter is fresher and cruncher than that of other chicken places.  The chicken tenders are the best.  Super crunchy outside, most and juicy chicken inside.  The seasoned fries are very good, and crunchy as well.  The best is the biscuits!!  Soft, flaky, butter, moist, they are absolutely delicious.  Great for a tasty quick eat."}
{"text":"Poor Management leaves a great chain looking like garbage. Came here cause I haven't had Popeyes in a long time and this is the service that they give out. Garbage on every table nothin is wiped down garbage cans are filled and spilling out. The food tasted great but who enjoyed eating around garbage. Its soo nasty I wanna clean up myself. Update manager and out and cleaned up most of the garbage and asked how I was doing. Words of advice first impressions are the most important ok move my rating up to 3 stars instead of one"}
{"text":"This place irritates me so much. I would never ever go here except my daughter loves it. Two times now have gone through drive thru. And order chicken nugget meal. Never get total at the drive thru always please pull forward. Second time was told it would be five minutes because no nuggets available. Please pull forward to parking space and we will bring it to you. Well guess what the second time they totally forgot we were out there. I even joked with the drive thru little boy that they forgot us last time, was this going to happen again. And guess what they did again! Had to send my daughter in to get her food again. Ridiculous.. This place irritates me to no end. No apologies no nothing."}
{"text":"I give this place 2 stars because the piece of chicken I ate was good. I got the 12 piece meal it came with 8 chicken wings(feathers included and 3 of the wings were dark brown), 2 chicken breast, 2 thighs. No chicken legs for the kids. The staff was horse playing, touching their hair, then their face and then delivering the food to the customers cars (no hand washing at all). Our order took 35 minutes to come out. I over heard the manager getting mad at the employees because they were not doing anything. All of the tables were dirty and the orders were taking super long. There was a couple in front of us that waited  45 minutes for their food.smh. Very disappointed with the crew and their customer care."}
{"text":"It never fails, EVERY TIME I order red beans and rice, they leave it out. I eat from this popeyes at least once a week since it's convenient to my house. No matter what combo I order if I ask for red beans and rice, they forget it or give me mashed potatoes I instead. Tonight I ordered popcorn shrimp/fish combo for me and chicken strips for a friend. 1 side comes with the fish and two with the strips. I asked for red beans and rice, jambalaya and green beans. The girl at the window, who clearly was not in the mood to be bothered with customers said I needed to park so they could drop the fish. Ok, I was fine with that. I do led checked the receipt while I waited to make sure she entered the sides I asked for and they were present. The manager brought my food out to the car and was very polite in asking if I wanted any additional sauces. I was on the phone and figured since the sides were on the receipt and it was the manager that brought out the order, surely it would be correct. I get home and what do you think was missing.....THE RED BEANS AND RICE. If this were the first time or even the second I would and have let it go. But as often as I eat here and still have yet to actually receive a red beans and rice. This is my last time going to this one. The popeyes on Durango is further but at least I get what I paid for."}
{"text":"Came in here desperate to find a loo and ordered a spicy chicken sandwich to go on impulse - all I can say is that it is way better than anything comparable fast food chains would be offering. I confess at this point I am a bit of a food snob and really hate the decor, pictures of food and almost everything else about this place BUT the spicy chicken sandwich had a good batter (light and crispy), the spicy mayo was good (although there was too much of it) and the chicken tasted freshly prepared and was well fried. Pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Came here because parsley mediterranean screwed up on my chicken and burnt it. i asked my wife to get me
popeyes and to make sure it wasn't over cooked. Needless to say i am 0-2 today:(. So sad when you spend over 20 dollars in food on one day and get the results i got. Good luck to the next family or fool that purchases their meal here. I will pass next time. I will not be back after what this place served us."}
{"text":"Same as the first review.  It's close and near my place of employment but unfortunately every time I try it out the chicken tenders are always dry as hell. The corn and potatoes can be kept on a heat lamp for the most part but when it comes to the chicken it should be cooked to order. Skip Popeye's Louisiana and head to canes."}
{"text":"Popeye's is not just for breast men or leg men or even your every day garden variety wing man. They cater to the thigh lovers out there. I ordered a 3 piece thigh combo meal with red beans and rice along with a large drink for $7.64. The meal includes one of those delicious buttery biscuits. The chicken and the red beans and rice hit the spot.

The a/c at the place is also just at the right temperature on one of those 112 degree days. I'm definitely including Popeye's in the summer lunch rotation."}
{"text":"It's really hard for me to stop laughing while reading some of these past reviews by a bunch of \"greyheads\" or other yelpers that don't know how to check their order at the drive thru.

I've been here several times without any order mix ups. The service has always been outstanding. This Popeyes always gets the right mild and spicy pieces of chicken correct on my order. For example, yesterday I ordered a 4 piece combo and one extra piece of chicken, then I upgraded to a large drink and needed a water cup as well with fries as the side. On top of that I requested 3 thighs and two wings with the wings being spicy and the thighs being mild. Not only was my order correct; I was charged correctly by being charged $1.79 for the extra piece of chicken plus an additional $.40 to upgrade the drink size. I even commented to my wife at the table how good these guys were at getting special order requests right.

I would say you get a reasonably priced filling and delicious meal at this Popeyes. And don't forget the tastiest item - the biscuits!"}
{"text":"A nice solid option. I've been at this Popeye's twice and it was all good. Last time I was there I ordered the 8 piece family pack which included 8 pieces of chicken, a side (fries) and 4 biscuits. The person at the counter got it right when I dictated 5 pieces spicy and the two thighs and one breast not spicy. That was $17.99 with tax to feed three people.

Since this is the first week that they have been opened there a few kinks to workout. The restroom has a key that you have to keep track of, I guess you can't lock the door from the inside. Plus the loudspeaker where they call your name when your order is ready is garbled and really annoying to listen to.

All the food was delicious. The biscuits were the highlight for me; they were perfect. I've been to other Popeye's that either put too much butter or some other ingredient in the biscuits so great job Popeye's, it's about time that you have come to the east valley."}
{"text":"The chicken is good, up to the standard ppl expect from this fried chicken restaurant.

But the staff is horrible. Numerous times I have returned to inform them I asked for greens not rice or mac'n cheese. My kid is allergic to milk, so I do not order cheese. If this was a once or twice occurrence, I would not mind. 
But almost every time our order is messed up. There have been several times I did not drive back to correct my order, because I have come to expect the wrong order."}
{"text":"Waste of time and money. Went through the drive thru
Got some dried up hard as a rock fries and chicken strips. Nasty to say the least. Obviously it's had been sitting out for a while. Probably won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Good food but I feel the prices are overpriced. I recommend the beans and rice and the fries and the wing combo. Delish ! Definitly one of my favorite chicken spots. The biscuits are addictive ! Don't recommend if you are on a dirt but if you are just looking for good food try it out."}
{"text":"Nice looking location but my chicken sandwich was extremely dry. I could only finish less than half of it before I threw it away. Tasted like it was sitting there for a while or something. 

As for the location itself, it's super clean, bright and modern looking. Manager was nice and even gave my boyfriend an extra chicken leg for the wait. 

I'd give this location another try as the service was good and everything was overall clean."}
{"text":"I went to this location today and ordered a 12 piece meal and it took almost 45 minutes for me to receive my order. I watched customer after customer come in, order, receive their food and leave. When 7 other people after me had come and gone I ask the cashier where my order was, it seems it was NEVER entered even though I was charged. This does NOT seem like good customer relations to me!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. They don't even have water cups for customer. They don't provide any sauce for chicken tender unless asked. They don't provide spoons for mash potatoes unless asked. They don't serve their customer. Don't ever come here again. It's a waste of time."}
{"text":"Friendly cashier but chicken was over cooked and left under lamp way too long, almost uneatable.
Biscuits dry. Cole slaw excellent. Will definitely NOT 
go back."}
{"text":"I believe Popeyes is finally listening to its customers! They have new employees and manager! I received my correct order and it was hot! Much improved from my last couple of visits to this location. I believe you will receive better service inside rather than the drive-thru. At least that has been my experience."}
{"text":"I've visited this location a few times and although I have had good customer service, the staff always seems very disorganized and the chicken is always overcooked and dry. 3 times and the same issues occur, which is enough for me not to visit this location again."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Awesome sauce (for the strips). Everyone was polite and friendly.

And that chicken, to die for... or to cluck for... or... never mind."}
{"text":"This is my guilty pleasure and I'm not kidding. They have a drive through. They serve the chicken nice and hot. I love the spicy version. Popeye's chicken isn't too salty like the others, it's seasoned just right.

Out of all fried chicken, this is my favorite because it is crispy. Now, KFC has crispy versions of their original recipe as well -- but these are not always as readily available as the original, plus their batter coating is a bit thicker, nothing wrong with this if it's your preference, but I prefer Popeye's lighter coating.

They have \"unusual\" side dishes like spicy cajun gravy, rice and beans and dirty rice, beyond the usual staples.

This location is consistent and fast. They take their chicken seriously around here and it's definitely worth crossing the road for... (drum roll)"}
{"text":"Tastey fast food Chicken in Tremont. $6 gets you 3 chicken strips, a side, biscuit and drink. Cheap and warm. About what you expect from fast food."}
{"text":"Love the chicken tenders with the sweet heat sauce. I love that the chicken is cooked to order. The service is good and the place is well kept. My sister ordered some special chicken meal they had and it was absolutely disgusted. It tasted like chemicals or something synthetic and rank. She didn't even finish it. She told the manager and he said that x amount of people ordered it this morning with no complaints. Didn't try to compensate for a crappy meal so the customer service is lacking. Free delivery in the area with a minimal $25 order."}
{"text":"I usually go to the aurora location but i was in richmond hill one night and decided to stop in at this location. I was pretty disappointed when i got home. I ordered the chicken tenders and they weren't even warm. My drive home was only about 7 minutes. Im pretty confident my order wasn't freshly made. It was ready within minutes. Usually i have to wait several minutes and i always order the same thing. The girls at the front cash seemed pretty unorganized. Ill stick to the aurora location from now on.
I've been here a few times over the past couple months and I must say the service is kind of lacking. I always order the chicken tenders and always have to ask them for sauce."}
{"text":"I had to leave a review on this fastfood chain, as this location never fails to impress me. This has to be the cleanest, most organized, and friendliest Popeye's location I have been in.

They have enough staff, and wait for food is not long at all. There's a TV, lots of seating (booths), and during our stay, I have seen staff cleaning tables every now and then, no wonder why this place is kept clean.

Review 95 of 100"}
{"text":"We went there few weeks ago, order 3 piece spicy combo and spicy chicken fingers combo and the girl who took our order was cool and all of a sudden another girl interrupted her (rudely) asked what we wanted again! Then went we got to the window to pay they were out of blacked ranch and out of spicy chicken only had original. Ugh. Not happy at all. They need to rehire employees there."}
{"text":"Great food, always hot and ready to eat. Friendly staff, always super nice. Idk why they would only have 2 stars. Everytime we would go there we would have a great experience. And its always clean inside and out. Overall, I would recommend this spot rather than the 90th st and Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Took my best friend here (both of us are pregnant) & it's not the Popeyes we know ! The spicy wasn't spicy at all & everything was cold !"}
{"text":"Usually the food is good but yesterday I had the most horrible sandwich I have ever tasted. I could tell it was old...I had to throw  it out."}
{"text":"best gotdamn spicy chicken ever (for fast food)!!!!!! it is so juicy everytime that i just can't enough of this place."}
{"text":"So I went through the drive-thru today and I ordered 24pc Cajun wings & Large red beans and rice with a soda. I gave the worker \"Kenny\" my card and some other guy gave me the food and then Kenny gave me my card back.. I ask if I can have some sauce. once he gave the sauce to me he said to me with attitude \"NEXT TIME ASK WHEN YOU ORDER.... YOUR SLOWING DOWN MY LINE \" and I responded with  \"you never asked me if I wanted any sauce I'm sorry.\"    I came to the same Popeyes 2 days ago and returned today because  the service/food was good but today's service was very disappointing. Kenny's rude attitude and tone of voice mades me not want to go back. A manager should address the way he talks to customers because it's unlikely I was the only one who has \"slowed down his line\" by asking for sauce I wasn't ever offered. Kenny should get no stars."}
{"text":"We are so grateful to Eddy and his team at Popeye's!! We used Popeye's catering for our Junior League of Phoenix Rummage Pre-Sale Party and it was delicious. Our theme was \"A Night in New Orleans\" and the food was amazing. Eddy was so wonderful to partner with. Not only did we receive exceptional service, but he also donated Mardi Gras beads for our party! We really appreciate Eddy and the team at Popeye's for their support of community programs across the Valley! Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Horrible! First off they are not busy enough at that place for them to have people pull forward in a drive through and wait 20 mins for your food. Ridiculous. First off I went through drive through ordered 1 chicken finger combo that's all  no one behind me in line no one in front of me they lady tells me to pull forward I said okay pulled forward literally 15 min later I'm still sitting there and I'm think why is it taking so long it's empty only 2 people inside the building I put my truck in park walked in and seen 2 couple in the lobby eating 1 person now in drive though and me who waited over 20 mins still no food so I'm in the restaurant and a lady tells me she will be with me in a min more mins past and I tell the lady in drive through who checked me out I been waiting in my car for over 20 mins for a chicken strip combo mean I said it is to hot I need my food. They had no fries I said I don't care I don't want fries just give me a potato's since they did have that. They where not even planning on bringing out my food they forgot about me and the place was not even busyyyyy!!!! 

Never again I'm sticking to churches right up the street."}
{"text":"Came here with a mate for our lunch break, upon entering the establishment the first thing i noticed was how the greasy the door handle was. My mate and i waited about 5 mins in line, there was one person ahead. The cashier notified me about the special of the day, but i declined. Got the 3 pcs platter. Food took about another 5 minutes to come. Got to the table and i went to the small room to remove the previous grease on me hand. But nope she was all locked up. Finally after 15 minutes some bogan came out of the restroom. I went it and it stank. Upon washing my hands i went for the dryer and she was tits up broken. Went for some tp and it was empty. Dried my hands on my pants dissappointed. Ate the meal, was pretty good tasting but hella greasy. Ordered on rings and they gave me like 6. Wtf mate. After eating i tried to be a good customer and throw my trash out, but of course the trash can was full! So i threw my garbage on the heaping pile and left. Oh yeah one piece of chicken left. Took it outside and threw it to the Maggies."}
{"text":"We love this place. So many people have so many negative things to say. The only reason for the 4 stars is due to their side sizes. A regular is so small and a large is not very large. For the price of them they could be a little better sized (especially if you are doing a family night). 
Their tenders are so yummy. I love the spicy flavor. The red beans and rice is very good too and their biscuits are pretty good. I have yet to try the tea but I'm tempted every time!!!! 
I have never had to wait in a crazy line and I have never had bad food from this location."}
{"text":"Out of chicken. And this was not the first time? This location? Trash. Popeyes really needs to get it together. They always have eye-catching deals on tv, but when you visit a store, you get teenagers with 0 customer service skills, they don't have the deal from the ad on the side of the building, and honey packets that are literally never clean. Get enough food to support the deals advertised. This is getting ridiculous. If you still plan to visit this location, call first to ensure that they have what you're expecting..even if it's just a few old chicken strips."}
{"text":"Great food and one of the cleanest bathrooms I've ever been to at a Popeyes. We are visiting family and we are making a note that this is a good place to stop."}
{"text":"I have always liked Popeye's Chicken. Was on my way to my office, decided to pick something up on the way. Seen a sign on the freeway that showed Popeye's is off the next exit. Took me awhile and a lucky turn when I gave up looking for it. But there it was,
Ordered my usual, three piece white, extra crispy and spicy with red beans and rice. 
Like always it was great, 
I went through the drive through, it was a little early so it was not busy. Got my food really quick and off I went."}
{"text":"Let me make this clear to everyone!!! People at fast foods are there for a reason! Most of them are going to school, or just there for the summer! i am not talking bad about them! Most of them, this is their first jobs!! So the service at most fast food joints are not going to be great. With that said, this location does have some issues. But that is expected. Popeyes Chicken is my favorite fast food chicken only behind Pioneer's!!! I love their spicy chicken, mashed potato's and gravy, and red beans w/rice. I like that their menu has a lot of different items! This location is the closest to my home. So when I am in the area, watch out! I'll be there!"}
{"text":"UGH......Just ate at this place and I feel sick. Heard it had changed and had good food, so I though I would give it a chance. Ordered the special, 4 pieces of chicken, fries and a biscuit. The fries were all that was edible. The chicken was in the form of a large fried piece of breaded (hard) something. The breading was not good, I removed what I could and did find some chicken, but it was as dry and tasteless as can be. I made it through almost  2 of the 4 pieces. The biscuit was a round, limp, funny tasting piece of pastry, 2 bites was all I could take. I ate all the fries. Absolutely horrible food. I would not eat this again if I was starving, dreadful and now my stomach is upset. Might be time for a purge, even though there was no binge."}
{"text":"Love this location. The people here are so nice and they got their Tuesday special back. Cheap and easy lunch"}
{"text":"Anytime someone talks about Popeyes there are nothing but good things said. My first experience with this chain was less than stellar. We ordered one of the family combos which came with one side, and we chose their macaroni and cheese and wanted to add a side of their mashed potatoes but was told they were all out. We waited about 20 minutes until someone came out and said that it was almost done. About 5 minutes later the same gal came out saying that they were out of macaroni and cheese. It would have been nice to know that from the beginning or 5 minutes ago when we were told it was almost done. We picked another side of fries since they seemed to be out of everything. Good thing they had chicken! My husband went to go get a soda at the new soda fountains where you can add flavorings and they're lots of different drinks. Everything was pretty much out besides the Dr. Pepper. Might as well have the regular sofa fountains. Our food finally arrives 30 minutes later. And we here the cooks in the back yell \"Mac and cheese up.\" And all of a sudden everyone around us gets their orders of Mac and cheese. I went to the counter to get butter and honey and the nice employee said they were out of butter but had honey. Anyway!! Super nice people but they are \"OUT\" of everything. Management needs to figure out how to do the ordering for the store. Very disappointing. If i want chicken, I'll stick to chick fil a or even KFC."}
{"text":"My family loves Popeyes chicken.  This branch is the closest to our house.  Food is always good.  The only thing I don't like about this place is the wait.  It is supposed to be a fast food place but last time I went , there must be at least 6 of us that waited 15 to 20 mins to get the food.  And the last 2 times before that was also a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"My Sister comes here every Tuesday to get her chicken fill LOL

its quite cheap, twoonie tuesday.

Service is pretty quick, lots of people come and go out of this location because its pretty small."}
{"text":"Probably the worst place I have ever been to! If I could give 0 stars I would! The manager Monique (or so she says her name was that) and employee keondranique were so rude and unprofessional! They charged my card 3 times saying it was declining. I then payed cash and thought it was weird cause I know I have money in my account.. when I checked my bank account I saw 3 transacations from Popeyes! I told the manager to give me my cash back cause I was already charged and to refund me cause at this point I was tired of the BS they were telling me! She was like we charged you correctly!! I told her \"NO YOU DIDN'T YOU CHARGED ME 3 TIMES\" she's was so stupid and had a dumb look on her face cause she's the one who charged my card..she then proceeded to tell me that she was right when she wasn't..I left there so angry telling her that she was dumb and didn't know what the hell she was doing!! And she told me to F off!! And to go F my mother.. I called corporate to complain and they said a manger higher then her would call me back! Till this day I haven't received a call back or my money back for all the transactions!! I will never ever come back to eat at this restaurant!!( and to top it off when I left my order was incorrect and missing 3 items) they seriously need to reconsider who they hire for these positions! They have the meanest most rudest people working! I mean I guess I can't expect a whole lot with fast food right!"}
{"text":"This place has fallen off a lot.  This is the oldest Popeyes in Toronto.  They even had the lightbulb sign just like in Chicago way before Popeyes was mass franchised in the 2000s.  They used to make the chicken perfectly crispy and juicy on the inside and the biscuits buttery, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  It was perfection.  However, I went there last week and caught a cold bug and the food was depressing - soggy everything.  They need to keep the kitchen standards up.  The old Indian owners from the 90s were the best, but the new people have screwed this place up."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place has fallen off completely with the new Indian workers.  They no longer make your chicken fresh to order and everything is now soggy since they just leave it under the heat lamp all day.  It was perfect when they first opened but it is now like your average ghetto Popeyes.  It is unbelievably greasy and soggy now.  When they first opened with the Filipino workers there it was perfectly dry and crispy on the outside and moist in the middle. Too bad."}
{"text":"This place is brand new really close to my house I love the food but they're never consistent , The soda machine is always out of soda .. out of coleslaw!! There still NEW  hopefully they will work out the kinks"}
{"text":"Popeyes chicken is always good, their chicken is always hot and cripsy. I usually order the 10 peices with 2 sides, mash potatoes and Cajon rice. However, recently they discontinued the cajun rice which is really disappointing. I substituted it with the beans and rice but it's not the same. They need to bring back the cajun rice! But overall, great meal for family time."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Popeyes I've ever been to I went in because I wanted to sit and eat my order was wrong the cashier I had he had me to repeat the order twice and it still was wrong tried to get something to drink and there was at least 6 drinks gone I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone  it really sucks"}
{"text":"Nice, hot and great cust svc skills!
Thx for taking care of us during our travels. 
Really appreciate it,  thx Jesse and team"}
{"text":"Do not visit this premises on tuesdays lol. Crowded."}
{"text":"Most preferred Popeye's location byfar.  Everything is always prepared fresh. No complaints ever regarding the food itself.  They charge for delivery, but its worth it."}
{"text":"This place is 50/50.  At least for the most part I have visited enough times for them to know to put the spicy mayo on my popcorn shrimp sandwich.  

Delivery I can recall was okay, they are pretty cool about ordering last minute really late. And compensated for items that werent available. It was a surprise but still I can't blame them for the time. 

Take out, sometimes I can't rely upon on a few occasions the bread didn't seem fresh and they were stingey on the shrimp. 

Last time we ordered and ate there and there was no complaints. So again, I have mixed reviews."}
{"text":"One of the more nicer and cleaner places I've been too.   Order was called in before pick up.   Everything done right just forgot napkins that's all.   

Gotta love the popcorn shrimp sandwich that one is my favourite and keeps me coming back.   There are other chicken places out there but what about that amazing popcorn shrimp..  Unbeatable!"}
{"text":"today my husband and I went to Popeyes for a. $5.00  lunch and we're more than pleased.The place was very busy and the service ran smoothly and staff was very pleasant.The food was great the chicken strips were moist on the inside and super crunchy on the outside.The slaw was nice and crispy biscuits were fabulous as well as the onion rings great.We were pleasantly full and only for $5.00 and a smile to boot."}
{"text":"The staff was out right rude on this visit.  I have been there with my family at least 6 times since they opened, but only through the drive-thru.  Tonight i Paid for a full meal and asked for one ranch and got attitude for asking, manager told clerk to get me one and clerk said she had to charge me since i did not have strips.  WTF?... I ordered a full meal.  Then i get to my table and realized i did not have a spork, went back up to counter to ask if i could have silverware and was pointed to a area to get it.  Turned my back and clerk says \"no!\" Out of sarcasm, with patrons in the place.  Real professional!  The clerk should be fired for such attitude. Left pissed off and dissatisfied.  Terrible service and i wont be back."}
{"text":"This is the strangest location I've ever been to. So I placed an order through the drive-through. They got it wrong. I got the combo, instead of just the chicken in the biscuit. So I went in and I told him they got it wrong. Everybody's coming up to me so apologetic I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. I'm like I just want a refund for this side that I didn't order. I'm starving I just want to go. Finally the manager comes out and says what's the problem. I saw the associate tell them what the problem was. So I told him I just need a refund for the side that I didn't order. He tells the associate to throw it out. I said you don't have to throw the whole order out. She throws it out. I'm shaking my head. He then gives me a refund for the whole order. Real passive aggressive-like.  I just turned around and walk out... I'm going home to eat leftovers.

UPDATE: Later on I decided to go back. They did it wrong, again.  It was like Groundhog's Day, but they corrected it this time.  I won't be back to this location until they get it right."}
{"text":"I love their food. Being from GA I love red beans and rice, corn on the cob biscuits and the way they season their food. 
This popeyes had very friendly staff. Very helpful and smiling. We always get a gallon of sweet tea when we are going to be out for the day. We got a gallon of two and two cups of tea since we were eating in. I had to ask for the sweet tea in the store to be refilled and she did it right away with a smile on her face. 
I would like to visit this location again. 

FORGOT TO ASK ABOUT MILITARY DISCOUNT :-("}
{"text":"Another Popeyes Chicken location. 

This one's quite prettily decorated. They have WiFi and they have a bunch of outlets if someone wants to use them. 

Ordered:

4 piece dinner with onion rings and a biscuit. $8 something before tax. Usually comes with a thigh, leg, wing, and breast. We wanted all thighs. They said that the thigh up charge was $1. We accepted, although I really don't understand why there would be a charge for downgrading white meat to dark meat. We ordered mild, but he told us they only had 3 mild thighs and asked if one could be spicy, because another mild would take 7-8 minutes to cook. We didn't want to wait that long, so we agreed. We asked him to put it into a separate box so we could easily identify it. He put it in with the onion rings (then told us he did). He was about to hand my order to me when he realized he neglected to put a biscuit in there, so he took the order back and put the biscuit into the box with the onion rings and the spicy thigh. 

Onion rings seem battered, not breaded. I would have preferred them a tad more thinly cut, but that's my preference. Taste-wise, they were not bad. Not mind blowing, but perfectly acceptable. I wish there were a couple more though. There were about 8 of them, I think. 8-10? Something like that. The mild chicken I can't speak for, but the spicy chicken wasn't all that spicy. I can't handle that much spice (Korean ramen spice makes me need to drink water, not because of the MSG), but this didn't bother me. Crispy, crunchy wise (Cuz this and the tenderness are the most important things), the crunch lasts. My grandmother had hers 2 hours after we bought it, after we had had a 20 minute car trip in which the chicken pretty much steamed itself in the box, and when she was eating it, it was still making crunchy noises. The chicken was tender too. Pieces are considerably bigger than KFC. 

All in all, not bad, but not as cheap as I could get for equally as good chicken and portions (I think I'll stick to 4C Broast if I can make that call)."}
{"text":"What happened? I grew up with Popeye's. This place is not the Popeye's of my youth. My first visit was amazing. I was home again. The last 3 have been like a bad dream. The first bad experience was only getting home to find the only thing correct in my order was the amount of chicken I ordered. At least I think it was chicken. It was so dry and small I can't be sure it wasn't swamp rat. One off? Maybe. The second was not as bad only shorted me 2 pieces of chicken I waited 25 minutes for. The 3rd and final visit was no less eventful. It started with one employee yelling at another employee not to \" f**k up the orders\". My 10 year old daughter was really impressed. Then I was told I couldn't have coleslaw be cause \"the coleslaw machine was broken\". I want one of those. So I took my emotionally scared daughter home for another lack luster meal from what used to be Popeye's. By the way if you fill out the survey and request a call back they don't care. I assume this because they don't call back."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I'm even in the car right now without throwing up. I spent more time trying to get the right order than I actually did eating, because they got most of my orders wrong. The food was alright though. Never coming back!!"}
{"text":"I have gone into this location several times. Each time, ALL the tables were dirty! Their chicken is the best! I witnessed a homeless man going through the trash inside the restaurant until he was asked to leave. In the future, I will only order through the drive up window. This store is ghetto."}
{"text":"the drive thru needs help!!! they need to check on their orders because it is always short/missing orders and wrong orders. I know I should have checked but I ordered 2 things and thought they wouldn't mess up but they did. i was at home when I discovered it. I called and spoke to manager Jonathan. he gave me a free meal for the meal I didn't get. Yay!!! warning: watch out and check orders before leaving whether it's drive thru or inside !!! chicken is GREAT !!! no complaints"}
{"text":"I ordered a $10 meal and got the little scraps left (small chicken pieces , few fries) so I address the situation and get looked at stupidly by the manager and get another piece of chicken ( they reluctantly give) than I sit down at a booth behind a display wall and could hear the employee and manager disrespecting me very badly.  I will never eat here again. Sorry I wanna get what I pay for"}
{"text":"Reminiscent of the old Popeye's that was in a gas station down the street from me off Thornydale in Tucson.  The sole Tucson Popeye's left now on the east side pales in comparison to this one.  This is one is hot, fast and cheap; exactly what you would want.  They are on the ball in putting together the orders and getting them into the customer's hands quickly.  The food tastes delicious.  I had the Shrimp Po-Boy and it was the bomb, just like Mister Ed's in Metairie, LA.  I could eat one every week (I used to when I lived there)!  The Red Beans and Rice was spicy good too.  They both made me long for going back to N'Awlins again just for a dining spree.

My grandson thought the mild chicken tender in his kid's meal was not spicy enough but then he eats his Taco Bell with fire sauce.  He liked the Cajun Fries too.  My wife got the mild Chicken Po-Boy.  She said the chicken was light (not greasy at all) and flavorful (not too spicy).  Her only complaint is that she could have used one more chicken strip if it was going to be served on such a large bun.  There was a lot more bread than chicken.  The fries were standard seasoned fare, she wishes she would have tried a different side.

If we lived here I would be a regular customer.   Somehow, I'll have to settle for waiting for our annual trip to Arizona Mills."}
{"text":"Yes the service might not be as fast as some people might want it to be. But the management and the staff offers amazing customer service. Great environment. Super clean and very friendly. I have never been to a Popeyes that is always in such a great mood. Food is fresh and cook just right. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"There is not even a soap dispenser in the men's bathroom! How does staff wash their hands after using the bathroom? I had the tenders they were good. Husband had chicken, sad looking chicken. Staff not very friendly and all of them act like today was their first day on the job. Soda machine was broken. I like Popeyes food, but I don't plan on coming back to this lication."}
{"text":"Just had the worst fast food experience. The staff here is horrific.  We waited in line to order, with 1 car in front of us, for 15 minutes. Once we ordered, we waited another 10 minutes for our food, only to be informed that they got our order wrong. We sat there and watched as the employees sat around. The guy working the drive thru was rude and unapologetic.

Another 10 minutes later we had our food.  The way they had packaged it, the food was all over the place. We weren't offered anything for the long wait or the mistake."}
{"text":"What happened to this location's service???? Haven't been here in about three months and what a difference. And not a good difference. The order employee had to be told several times and service very slooooow. 
The whole atmosphere in this establishment seems to have changed."}
{"text":"Food was good but I was disappointed that they boxed my orders in one box when I ordered two separate meals. They also shorted me out of an order of fries. The girl told the other girl that it was okay to box my orders in one box which I didn't want that. That's what you call night shift workers being lazy.. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Every single time I come here they are out of something and there is a 20-30 minute wait . Is this fast food or what ? Popeyes is a multi-million dollar company yet can't seem to serve or have available what they claim to offer . I used to love Popeyes but this location has turned me away for good ."}
{"text":"I love Popeyes, and I est a dofferent location quite frequently.  My wife and I had an urge and this one is close, so we went.

The food is normal Popeyes good, we had the 3 piece chicken strips, but there were a couple of differences from the others.

First it is SLOW.  From order to food was 20 minutes.
Second, the portions in this place were a lot smaller than other locations; usually we get the 2 piece and are stuffed when we leave.  Here we got the 3 piece and were still hungry.

So if we want Popeyes and don't want to drive, we will go here.  Otherwise, we'll go to one of the others."}
{"text":"I grew up on Popeyes - back in high school after tennis practice i would get a 5 piece dark for $2.99.  My first job at 16 was at a grocery store bagging groceries but I desperately wanted to work at Popeyes.  Every time I move, i dont tell anyone but Popeyes has a role in my moving process - I need to be within striking I mean driving distance to my spicy chicken.

So this is currently the closest Popeyes to my house and it is the worse Popeyes I have ever had.  I've been here about 30+ times and probably 1/3 of the time they bait and switch me.  EVERY SINGLE TIME.   i ask for spicy and they give me the mild.  And it's not fresh out of the fryer mild.  It's the mild that no one orders - that gets dried up over time.  I should report their store manager.  I think he/she tells his staff to purposefully serve the mild chicken especially if you go through the drive through.....And why do they even offer mild here?  The mild is the worse fast food chicken...it's even worse than KFC.

Anyhow despite the fact I am let down 1/3 of the time i always come back.  Popeyes is part of my life and always will be.   There's Raising Canes - far superior but I have life long memories of Popeyes.  Maybe i'll now be forced to drive a few miles further to 215/Rainbow but till then i'll return here and cross my fingers I get my spicy chicken."}
{"text":"It's very unpleasant to get home without your entire order!  The staff is in need of supervision and training.  It felt like you were in a field trip with a bunch of 5 year Olds running the restaurant! !!"}
{"text":"We just came back from Popeye's and I see how many people have complained about the service. Just like reviewer, Alicia T. we were lucky enough to be waited on by VIctoria. WOW! If I currently owned a business, I would have grabbed her, paid her twice what she is making and hired her, so sweet and helpful. Our food was good, my only complaint is too much salt, but I feel that way about most everything that isn't made at home."}
{"text":"Staff name is Blanca. Very bad customer service. I used to stop by that place couple times already. This is the last time to go that place. I asked for ten pieces of chicken drumsticks. Just say how much is that.Staff act like shit. Management need to talk with that staff. 

Very bad customer service. If she still working there I will not go again."}
{"text":"This Popeyes is located in the Northwest area of Las Vegas right off of the Craig Exit on the US95. I went here during a weekday in the late afternoon.

Atmosphere: Not too bad
The dining area is clean, all the lights work. I walked in during a busy time of the day. My wait time wasn't too long, but there were 3-4 people behind me.

Service: Generally Friendly
I was greeted by the staff upon entering and it was pleasantly surprising to see the staff recognize regular customers and establish a first-name basis with these patrons.

Food: Nothing horrible, but nothing spectacular
I ordered a spicy Poboy sandwich with a side of baked beans. The baked beans were nice but were contained in a slimy kind of broth. Nonetheless, they were still served to me hot. The Poboy was ok, but I felt like the piece of chicken they had given me was not meant to fit in the bun they served. Also, the sandwich in general was tasteless. 

Overall: Nothing special. visit if you like Popeyes
The only thing I like about this Popeyes is that they serve food hot. However, sometimes they serve food to me that's hotter than what I can handle (temperature-wise). The food is ok, but nothing I would recommend off the bat. If it's a quick, cheap meal you're looking for, look no further!"}
{"text":"Hallelujah!!!  I had about 30 minutes to get from one terminal to another, go to the restroom, and find lunch to eat.  I was so excited to find Popeyes!

I didn't know if the food would be fresh or not, and my time crunch didn't give me time to browse the Yelp app, so I had to rely on the old-fashioned \"look around\" technique. Lots of people were eating out of Popeyes boxes so I took the chance and am pleased I did.

Extra nice feature: they had wet naps at the counter. Really great! Thank you Popeyes for helping air travelers on the go keep their hands clean."}
{"text":"No words every time I come to this location they are always out of everything I don't even know why I bother, and all the employees that work there are not at all helpful  nor professional!"}
{"text":"Where do I start... It took 10 minutes for someone to take my order then the girl that said she was going to pack my order just leaves for the day without giving me my food. Finally get my order 30 minutes later after I complained when I saw people that were their before me getting their order first. When they try to give me my order I was missing stuff.

Here is the kicker while waiting for my food a lady comes in saying she called earlier due to something being wrong with her order. When she shows one of the managers what it is, you can see a giant black hair in the chicken not just on top of the chicken but it looked like when they fried the chicken their hair was in the batter already. Also right before I left someone else came in saying their order was wrong.

This is a leadership issue it's starts from the top. Better training and more attention to detail. As for me I will not be going back. If you do, good luck."}
{"text":"Whether it is catering or a regular order, there has been something wrong or forgotten every time. Different staff members have also yelled over the phone, or left me on hold for over 15 minutes before I hung up. Popeye's has a low-quality staff here, even by fast food standards. 

As for the food quality, the fried chicken is slightly better (bringing up the rating) and the sides are worse than the average cheap chicken restaurant."}
{"text":"Well it looks like everyone whose ever came to this particular Popeyes has experienced terrible, SLOW service. What is going on guys??? I've managed to come here twice, only because my first time ordering here took so long (40 mins) that they offered to give me half off on my next order, it still took quite a while for our food to come out and it wasn't even busy both times I've visited. I will not be returning back."}
{"text":"We all need a fast food guilty pleasure -- this is one of mine.  Great meal options which are yummy & generally a good value....until my order gets mixed up.  The staff is very friendly, but they always seem to be a bit clueless or on the verge of running around like chickens.  Be clear & concise when ordering -- check your order before leaving!"}
{"text":"Have ordered from this location a few times. Good food but the customer service really needs improvement. The girl running the drive up window wasn't that friendly & looked like a deer caught in the headlights. 

Order was delicious. Will return but may try going inside instead of using the drive thru."}
{"text":"This Popeye's opened a few months ago close to where I work, so on the whim of looking for something different for lunch, I went here. 

Great service, very friendly & accommodating crew members, & delicious food all made for an enjoyable dining experience. I will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I don't usually review chain restaurants, but I've never eaten eaten at a Popeye's before so this seemed worth reviewing, even if just as a reminder for my own memory later.

Conveniently located between Lee's Palace and Bathurst subway station, I stopped in after seeing a sign advertising a Saturday special of $3.99 for 5 chicken wings. I ordered those wings, and then was offered to choose from the side dishes at only $1.25 a piece. So order sides I did. Mac & Cheese, French Fries, Onion Rings, Corn on the Cob, and a couple biscuits with the wings came to less than $12 after tax!?!?!? For drunk food ordering and the amount of food I received, I was impressed.

Now that said, the mac & cheese was pretty bad, the onion rings were nothing special, and the corn on the cob was kind of weird (probably as good as you could expect for a piece of corn that tastes like it was heated in a microwave without any salt)... But the french fries had a seasoned peppery goodness to them, and the wings were what you could expect from fast food chicken wings. But those biscuits?! Like eating a fluffy piece of butter. That may sound weird, but it was fantastic.

I'm not going to be rushing back to a Popeye's any time soon, but I kinda get why this place has put KFC into the background of the fried chicken game. Although I suppose it's been many years since I've eaten at a KFC either, thus further invalidating this review. 
I'll just stop typing now, and let you choose your own fast food fried chicken adventure."}
{"text":"2 pc. chicken for $.99 on Tuesdays! I love their food fresh off the fryer. When it sits under the heat lamp for so long the meat becomes rubbery. Thats why its best to go on their busiest day - Tuesday! Chicken will be hot and yummy!"}
{"text":"Popeyes might not be raising their prices directly but they sure are getting skimpy on their portions. Where is the other half of my rice & beans order? If that isn't bad enough, how about wiping the table down do your customers have a clean table to eat on. To wrap up a not so pleasant experience, waiting 20 minutes for an order that wad overlooked left me eating in a hurry to get back to work."}
{"text":"When it comes to fast food, I'm not very picky. I know that it ain't Chez Panisse or El Bulli that I'm dining at. Therefore, my list of requirements for a good fast food meal is quite short: clean tables, hot food, fast service, and some semblance of deliciousness. Popeye's definitely delivers in this regard. My two piece chicken meal was piping hot and quite tasty. The batter, though kind of bland, was nicely crispy. Definitely try the mashed potatoes, though -- the potatoes themselves are your slightly liquidy boxed variety, but the gravy is yummy. It's not your typical Canadian brown gravy; it's an American-style chicken gravy. The biscuit is good, too: buttery with a flaky exterior and spongy interior. The guy that was at the counter was really nice, too. 

You know what's best? THEY DELIVER. 

...aaaaaand you're welcome."}
{"text":"I been to other popeye chicken before and this time was as good as usual. The wait was a bit long for fast food restaurant but that means the the chicken tenders are fried on the spot and not waiting on a heated tray."}
{"text":"I haven't had Popeyes chicken for about 5 years and I forgot what it tasted like. We decided to go there for carry out dinner. My order was quickly taken by the cashier and she was very. She was very nice and courteous! I ordered two combo spicy fried chicken meals both with cole slaw. The combos came with a drink and a biscuit. Both meals were quickly made and I didnt have to wait. The biscuit was gross it had this fake margarine taste to it. The fried chicken was breaded nicely and it was juicy. The cole slaw was tasty too. My favorite fried chicken is still Frys fried chicken. Overall, I probably would go back because the food was edible and the customer service was great!"}
{"text":"The idiot cashier couldn't understand why we questioned the total of $18 when we only ordered 2 $5 boxes!!!! After breaking down the order and price her response I only do what the computer says......so you are telling me you can not count!!!!"}
{"text":"There's no way this company can NOT know this location does so bad. 25 minute wait at the drive thru with only 4 cars served.

I am taking the time to post this that corporate managers can hopefully do something. 

All we want is our chicken. This is the only Popeyes in this this particular neighborhood. That's the ONLY reason we come here."}
{"text":"Lol the workers here look so depressed

i ordered the three chicken tenders combo. It was my first time going here so i wasnt used to it but i wish they had normal sauces like ketchup and hot sauce. Their chicken tenders were really soft and delicious. I really liked their fries as well. 

I ordered one combo but they accidentally gave me two orders but charged me for one so not complaining."}
{"text":"I was cave'n Popeyes, since I seen it this morning . Well now it's dinner time, so I walked from MGM to Popeyes to grab some food to go. The ladies/employees were soooo nice. The manager looked like a girl I worked with, so immediately started talking to her as if she was her. I enjoyed my encounter and had a friendly experience with these employees. The chicken was hot, crispy and crunchy just like it's supposed to be. The taters and gravy, red beans and rice, fries and popcorn shrimp was spot on. I will definitely be back to this location next time I'm in Vegas. Keep up the good work and hope to see ya soon."}
{"text":"No chicken because it wasn't defrosted the night before? Rude people working, will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We just waited 20 minutes for two simple combo meals. There were probably 10 employees on property but apparently they needed 20. Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"Just arrived 10:15pm on a Friday.... they decided to close an hour early... reason, they were completely out of food."}
{"text":"Showed up at the Popeyes 10miles away because I was crazy Popeyes... Leon is hands down the best Popeyes employee I have ever encountered. I was not in a good mood after the alma school and queen creek location closed an hour early claiming to be out of good.... Leon changed my attitude from upset into genuinely happy. Popeyes you need to have Leon train all future hires. He should be the standard for all Popeyes employees."}
{"text":"Yuck!  Been here a few times over a year and never that good by was hoping for improvement.  Usually have been there during the week and daytime hours.  In this case, a rare Saturday 8 pm stop and a mistake.  Ordered regular chicken but they only have spicy and clearly didn't want to make more regular.  Had to order the spicy or not get anything.  Everything else was cold and gross as if they haven't made anything in an hour or two so stuff just sitting around.  Biscuits, Cajun rice etc gross.  Cold and didn't even taste right. Not going back."}
{"text":"Coming home, tired, and hungry.  A little spicy fried chicken and biscuits hits the spot.  It's what you would expect, it's fast food.  The order taker was friendly and the order was correct.  Most importantly, it tasted good.  Go there."}
{"text":"I like Popeye's.  I note some reviewers have problems with their orders.  Maybe I'm just lucky, but the few times I've been to this location, and the times I've been to others also, I've never had an issue.  Well, there was the time we got a family deal and they gave us more wings than we were supposed to get.  But that only happened once, and not at this location.

This location seems comparable to others I've been too.  The staff perhaps isn't quite as attentive (the one in Gilbert they all greet everyone who walks through the door).  But they took our order in a timely manner, and the food came out reasonably quickly.

As for the food, I like their spicy chicken and cajun fries.  Also, their beans and rice is a nice combination.  Flavorful, properly cooked, and good.  I do wish they would offer the jambalaya (some locations do, but none of the ones in the East Valley)."}
{"text":"Allow me to preface by saying that I'm rating this as a fast-food chicken joint.  Comparables are places like KFC and Louisiana Fried Chicken and Churches (etc).  I'm not comparing to Pappadeaux's or anyplace like that.

We were coming from a work out.  Didn't eat much before (hard to work out on a full stomach...sometimes get to feeling really sick when we do that).  So we were HUNGRY!  A craving for chicken was in the air, and especially Louisiana Fried Chicken.  But there was a notice on their door that the landlord had locked them out.  Consulting YELP we spotted \"Popeye's\".  So off we go!

The place didn't look special at all.  Routine fast-food look with a drive-thru.  Menu was similar to other fast food chicken places, except the \"Cajun rice\", \"Cajun fries\", \"red beans and rice\", and \"Jambalaya\".  You can get the chicken \"regular\" or \"Cajun\".

The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I went with a deal they had painted on their window, and then ordered some extras (Jambalaya and two sides).  Then realized maybe there was a deal that would include that and cost less.  The guy looked at the total, checked his board quickly, and said that was the best way to get what I wanted.

The food took about as long as expected for a fast food chicken joint.

The fries were like most seasoned fries I've had.  Maybe a little more kick, but not much more.  They were very good, but didn't jump up and say \"Cajun\" to me.

The Cajun rice was similar to a dirty rice (Cajun), and was good.  Not spicy (hot), but very tasty.

The Jambalaya was also good.  Again, not spicy.  Not comparable to Pappadeaux's.  But good.

We ordered half/half for the chicken so we could try the regular and the spicy.  The regular was like KFC used to be long ago (when KFC was \"Kentucky Fried Chicken\", and was good).  It was your basic good fried chicken.  The spicy was a bit inconsistent.  Some pieces were \"I feel the burn\" while others were more mild.  I preferred the spicy anyway.  Good fried chicken with a bit more flavor.

Frankly, I prefer the food at Louisiana Fried Chicken, but that doesn't do much good since they are evidently out of business (unless they can pay-off the landlord and get un-locked-out).  Popeye's was very good for what it is.

I foresee Popeye's being our new Cajun chicken joint for now.  If LFC comes back I may have to re-evaluate.  But we were very happy with the food we got here.  In fact, we even had the leftovers for lunch today!  :-)"}
{"text":"We were happy to see Popeye's show up.  We've been to others when we could, but none were close.  This one is close!

So we show up, order a spicy 12 piece plus sides, and dig in.  The chicken wasn't as good as I remember, but it was pretty good.  The sides left much to be desired.  The cajun rice seemed mostly to be liver spread.  I don't remember it being like that at the other Popeye's.  The fries were better...a bit of seasoning, and cooked properly.  A bit more seasoning would have been nice.  More than a bit of salt and I think it was paprika.  Give them a real Cajun flavor, ya know?  And I didn't see the jambalaya on the menu!!  It's at other Popeye's, why not this one?!

Anyway, it was fine but not as good as I expected.  I will try again, and next time get the rice and beans side dish instead.  And I will inquire about the jambalaya.  That was always a good accompaniment to their spicy chicken."}
{"text":"It's Popeye's.  A Cajun-style fried chicken chain.  This location was fine.  They all yelled \"welcome to Popeye's\" when we walked in (not necessary, but at least they noticed us!).  Service was prompt.  No problems experienced.

Food was good as it usually is at Popeye's.  No complaints.  I do wish they offered jambalaya or gumbo for sides.  I believe some locations do.  This one (and another in San Tan) don't.

if you want fast-food fried chicken, they're \"A-OK\"."}
{"text":"Longest wait ever. The workers come out to smoke while there is long line. I really need to report them.

EDIT: I called to get the owners name and number. I was hung up on. I called back and got no answer. 

I will call corporate in the morning to get this information."}
{"text":"Went today for the first time through the drive-through and ordered 
2 orders of the 3 pc combo with mashed potatoes and coleslaw and sprite for each meal. 
Paid $17,68
When I got home and unpacked everything I noticed that one order only had mashed potatoes and coleslaw. The other had only the chicken & biscuit. 
Very disappointing!!!! One of us got cheated on their 3 pc meal combo. 
This was definitely my last time ordering food from here. I do not have the time to drive back and get the rest of my meal. 
Also now looking at the receipt I see that they put in the order really weird. One with mashed potatoes and coleslaw and the other only with coleslaw., which was non-existent. Very bizarre! 
Too bad I wasted my money this way today!"}
{"text":"Only giving one start because 0 isn't an option. When I walked in the entire staff was eating and just looked at us when we came in. The guy at the register had hickeys all over his neck and had no customer service skills whatsoever. The location was extremely dirty... And when we were eating in the lobby they turned the lights off on us, even though the drive through was still open they continued to rush us out of the door. Other then taking our order, there was no form of customer service ever put in to place."}

Craving Popeyes chicken since I haven't had it in a month since we used to drive to Durango & Warm Springs just to get it!  This location has been open a week.

I was disappointed at first when people who ordered after us were getting their food and eating.  There was a extra large cook to order in front of us and when it was ready the guy wasn't even paying attention to his number being called so I politely repeated the number in the dining area.  

Then some of our food was being assembled and this other person with large order wanted her second mash potato and they removed it from our order. Finally after 20 minutes of waiting we were next.  I checked our food before leaving and it seemed only like warm but did not want to wait again. 

Opened the bag and took a bite of my tenders they were cold!  Ugh, put everything back in the bag, grab our coats and head back there.  We explained the chicken is ice cold.  A really nice woman helped us her name started with the letter \"V\", I cant seem to remember her name.  

She replaced all the chicken and sides for us, hot out the oven while now it's a quarter past eight PM and we head home the chicken smells amazing in the bag.  The chicken was piping hot, and my jambalaya is hot too.  She gave us a leg and a thigh for the trouble and she was a sweetheart and very understanding person.  She's a curvy woman with a big heart.  She made it all worth the second trip.

I just finished my leftovers from last night and if you debone the chicken it heats up fast in the microwave while still tasting flavorful.  Can't thank Popeyes enough for impressing us as customers.  Happy New Year to y'all."}
{"text":"We just had our takeout from this Popeye's location. We went around 4 PM and it took awhile for freshly made mild tenders but it was very good!  I especially love their large jambalaya as a side.  It clears my sinuses and has chunks of chicken, and sausage. Yum!  Basically why better than competitors! They have a leg and thigh Tuesday special but it no longer comes with the biscuit. Sad face.  Make sure you order biscuits in their buttery goodness with grape jelly.  I like mine with local honey.  The flavor you get is way worth the long wait time when it's fresh.  They hired two new people while we were there hopefully the service stays top notch and moves a little quicker.

A new location is opening near Flamingo & 215, we won't be driving 6 miles out of the way.

FYI: Our previous visit before this trip was not glamorous, the General Manager is actually a nice guy. He adds your name to a list in the office to keep track of who needs compensation. We had no trouble redeeming our two free meals and ordered additional sides. This is why I gave them a good rating they made the food right."}
{"text":"Oh My! Popeye's Louisiana Kitchen's are popping up literally everywhere around Las Vegas now and I am NOT complaining hehe! So if you follow my most recent reviews on Popeye's you already know that I have been on the hunt for the best location that can offer great customer services coupled with the best quality food. 

This newly opened location is right off Flamingo and 215 attached to the Chevron gas station. Since my mom loves Popeye's just as much as I do we headed over last week with our meal deal coupon for a 10PC chicken with the choice of tenders or mixed (legs,thighs,breast,wings). Tenders it was for this visit and with a fresh to order request we were parked right out front and had our food brought to us in a reasonable amount of time. 

Everything from the wait time all the way down to customer service we felt put this location in the top spot. The question now though is are they better than the Warm Spring & Rainbow location.. I believe they are tied but distance wise I can get to the Warm Springs & Rainbow location faster from home. I can now say that my search is over I have found not one but two great locations!"}
{"text":"Loooooveee that chicken from Popeye's.. Yes.. I sing that jingle from the commercial every time I pull up to the drive through. Now see I had absolutely NO business even eating from Popeye's however you have to treat yourself to some unhealthy greasy food every now and then geeezee. I seriously wouldn't have came if they hadn't sent me a coupon booklet that had a deal for my popcorn shrimp that I just couldn't pass up! 

Whenever you order the shrimp I love that it's always made to order(or should be) because what doesn't taste good fresh?! This location like many others is attached to a gas station with a drive thru that's around the back. My most recent trip to New Orleans is the one to blame for me rating this location a solid 3 stars. The same exact shrimp box tasted so much different and better that I just felt like mine was meh! Service was good but they forgot my sauce when parking me to wait for my order. Other than that no complaints. Usually Popeye's locations are going to be a hit or miss and this time it was a slight hit!"}
{"text":"I am seriously on the hunt for the best Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen in town and one that is consistently good! Is that too much to ask for because it's a fast food place? It's always a hit or miss situation with this place but I decided to try out this location one day on my way home. The popcorn shrimp item is one of my favorites and also too when usually I order the shrimp, they drop a fresh batch. On this visit though, they ended up giving me like half fresh and half ones that have been sitting around. I'm not a fool now, I know what the operation of this order was lol dump the fresh ones on top of the old one's... No sir! I kicked it right into reverse and handed it right back to them to fix my stuff properly. For these instances I always suggest to go inside and WATCH them in case somebody has some type of feelings and want to get to playing tricks with your food. This one was a miss....."}
{"text":"Yikes! I am glad my first experience here was great because based on these reviews from my fellow Yelpers they didn't luck out like I did! All I can say is TUESDAY SPECIALS ARE LEGIT!! I don't come very often but when I do you better believe it's on Tuesday and for that yummy special! I didn't even know this location existed until I went in this area of town for some quotes on a car repair. When I pulled up this last Tuesday there was NO WAIT, and this is definitely unlikely at most locations especially on the Tuesday Special day! When I pulled up to the drive thru person who took my order was friendly and easy to understand! Repeated my order correctly and had me pull forward! THIS is the kind of service that they need to send some lesson's to the one up on Durango/215 because that one is ran by a bunch of ignorant young teenagers! So glad I know where to come now so I don't have to be bothered with the ratchet one no more :-)"}
{"text":"Disclaimer, I was raised in New Orleans, and miss good Poor Boys, Crawfish, Boiled shrimp, Jambalaya  etc.... yadda yadda yadda, hear me whine...
 I try to be lenient when I go somplace because it's unreasonable to expect to find the food here that I would at the Magazine St. Po Boy shop. 
I was also raised on popeyes, every once in awhile I would hop off the Streetcar on the way to school and get a Chicken Biscuit w/cheese. 
And frequrntly I would get a 4 piece spicy, and even though it was a chain, it was a local chain with massive quality control. 
(and yes, odds are those years are most likely why over the past 3 years I've lost 250 pounds!.... Moderation kids!)

Over the years, the chain was sold off, the original owner died, and Popeye's became more hit and miss, especially the further you got away from the south.

Heck, you get your hopes up just to see a Popeye's!
usually the stand alone's are better, and the ones attached to Gas stations are hideous.

  
I've tried a few in the Phoenix area, And have been generally unimpressed. Not horrible, but just... a very thin flavorless crust.

So it was with trepedation that I went into this location, a drive through, attatched to a gas station.
I went for a box of chichen w/biscuits. and I can say it was the best I've had in the city so far.
The man at the window was friendly, the chicken was fresh, good, solid breading. With enough heat to give a nice depth of flavor, cutting a bit deeper than other chains would dare... which is what Popyes is all about. (I'm used to some blazing hot chicken... not stupid mind you, just HOT.. this is not that, but a good flavor. With good moist flesh, and thick crunchy skin. And the meal made the travel home well.
One downside? I'm just not a fan of these biscuits, they werent old... but they were dry... and lack the lush, buttery flavor and texture that I love. These were more dense and hockypuckish than I prefer.

If your craving some Popeye's chicken... well, lets put it this way,,, I'll be driving 20 minutes out of my way to go here.
This is my first time... so Your Milage May Vary..

 
Sidenote, I'n no Church's Chicken fan, but I went to the one on Arizona Avenue... and I've got to say, thats some fine spicy chicken! And cheap! And a big box of fried okra makes The Bride very pleased indeed!"}
{"text":"Chicken on $.99 leg and thigh Tuesdays! So frustrating but I don't go to this one anymore its a bit ghetto and out of my way to travel to just for some chicken the last time I went here the person in the drive thru taking orders didn't acknowledge me for almost 7 mins because they were texting on their phone. Terrible service then for me to only find out they were out of spicy chicken.. O_o supposedly... Never again!"}
{"text":"Looks like I am getting closer and closer to finding a good Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen in town because my last trip to this location wasn't bad at all! Close to the Warm Springs/Rainbow intersection you will find these guys attached to 7-Eleven...Not no 5 stars worthy but surely earned 4! The customer service here was great and I was acknowledged right away! I love when I can go to a place and they can move people around to make sure that the wait time isn't impacted. When I first got in line there was only one register open and shortly after another one opened. Waited less than 10 minutes which was good! They thanked us for our patience and kept the train moving along! I can definitely appreciate that. The chicken was as fresh as it could possibly get on this order! I had a few meal deal coupons from the sunday spam mail so I decided to use it for a 10PC spicy for me and my mom. Can't go wrong with a deal right?!"}
{"text":"I'm beginning to think that Popeyes doesn't teach the proper etiquette of customer service to its employees because I tell you what out of all the locations I've ever visited I've not once was pleased with any of the employees. So with this particular location I was only here by default because it was the closest one to the strip and I had a room down there at the time. I pull in in the drive thru and had to wait about 6 minutes before even being greeted and having my order taken. So once I got to the window the girl just out right says the total no smile just basically like i need your money and that's that. I asked for some hot sauce for the chicken and she looked at me like I was asking for something foreign... Ugh anyways yeah I can't do Popeyes no more man or else I'll be forced to cuss the next person out and I can't be brought out of my element for no damn fried chicken.."}
{"text":"I am giving this 2 stars because the biscuits were good. I don't normally eat fast food and chicken at that, but I had noticed that this place was super busy all the time so I thought we would give it a go.

My wife went out to get the food. She waited 25 min in line which is understandable since they where busy. We ordered for for 5 people and spent roughly $55 dollars on food which isn't all that bad. 

When she got home she noticed they didn't  put her food in the bag everyone else's was in the bag but hers. So she tried to call 2 times to see what they could do or there policy and what not. No answer. So she drove back to the place and told them the situation.

The manager said she had to bring all the food back so she could check the bags which we had eaten most of it by this point. My wife was furious and just asked for the money back on her meal and they insisted they needed to check the bags.

My wife went home crammed all the food eaten in the bag and took it to the store. The manager then dumped it on the floor and sifted through it. She then refunded her meal. This was pretty much the worst experience from a fast food place we have ever had period."}
{"text":"Nice location, always clean when I've gone. I like that they have a huge tv in the back to watch while you're eating. Sometimes they've got CNN on or NBA games, I'm sure you can ask to change the channel as well. I only go for the fresh biscuits and ask for honey packets and their mashed potatoes side, so I can't vouch for how good or crispy the chicken is. Good customer service and they have 100+ drink selections in their fancy new drink machine."}
{"text":"This location is terrible. Something is either wrong with my order every time or I'm asked to wait out front in the parking lot for extended periods of time. Today I had to repeat my very simple order multiple times and then upon checking my food before driving away, it was missing two of my sides as well as the sauces I asked for. They also had the drink order incorrect, which I unfortunately didn't realize until getting home. I was also the only car in the drive thru, so them being too busy was not even a factor. So disappointing. Will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"I used to go to the Popeyes location at Yonge and Dundas, and I can tell that this Danforth location is WAY BETTER than the other location I've been to. They provide good service, listen to your order, give you the RECEIPT, serve you the food in a reasonable amount of time, and actually get your order RIGHT. 

We ordered the 3 tenders meal (side of slaw) and 4 pieces of dark chicken. Food was yummy and we really appreciated it. 

If it wasn't because of the distance, we would go back again. 

Food: 4.5/5
Service: 4.5/5
Price: 3.75/5 - same as all Popeyes"}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely LOVE this place! The food is always fresh and great, the associates are ALWAYS friendly and it's very centrally located to shopping and other locations to which we frequently go. 

What else can you ask for than good food and friendly service?"}
{"text":"Went here after KFC at 1318 Craig road screwed up royally they helped me feel better made my food quick friendly service and nice employees good food made right what more can you ask for"}
{"text":"The employee Vanessa light skin black girl... gave me a horrible attitude also charged me double for sauce after waiting Xtra long for my food .. I'll never return to this location"}
{"text":"It's Popeyes...we received what we ordered and it was hot.  My wife and I each ordered a 2-piece combo meal that came with a biscuit and side.  My wife ordered the rice and I ordered the mashed potatoes side.  It was located in a service area on the toll road so prices were a little more expensive.  There were plenty of seats and tables in an open area and the facility was clean.  Parking wasn't an issue given the service area and there were other restaurants and stores to browse if desired."}
{"text":"I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't for the exuberant yelling of \"Hi! Welcome back to Popeye's!\" by the entire crew every time someone walks in the door. It's annoying and distracting. I've been here for 10 minutes and it's happened about 15 times... the last time a kid at a table next to me was holding his ears because it was so loud. Seriously, it's like a circus."}
{"text":"Very poor service and attitude - more than once. Asked about a featured item that was on a video promo displayed next to the menu. \"We don't have that today\" What about tomorrow? \"No, I don't think so\". Will you ever have the item \"Don't know\" It was some kind of banana pudding desert. Manager very stressed and showing it to customers. Have nearly 100 employees where I work. Word is spreading fast not to go here for lunch."}
{"text":"I usually love Popeyes, being in the military you usually always see them on posts. The customer service here is extremely unprofessional. The few times I went to this location I would order fries with my meal, and they were always cold. I once sat in the drive thru for 10 minutes, with only 3 cars ahead of me. Then the girl who was working the drive thru gave me attitude when I was being polite to her. I would not recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"Stopped in here recently for lunch. I love Popeyes Po Boy Sandwiches. 

Typical fast food establishment. Staff was young, but got the job done in a reasonable amount of time. Sandwich was good and the establishment was clean.

I'd stop in here again if I was in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"very poor service. The staff is racist, they laugh at all the white customers and try to make them feel inferior. The inside is somewhat clean, but very unsanitary at the drink dispenser. The fries and biscuits taste like something bought from the grocery store, but the chicken and shrimp..... Fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"Out all the restaraunts along Memorial Dr that give terrible slow and rude service on a regular basis without a doubt Popeyes has taken the crown for the absolute worst. I first ate there a few months ago and had a mediocre experience after a long wait for the food. last night however is another story. After a long hard day of work I was hungry and I saw cars in the Popeyes drive thru so I googled their hours and saw they close at midnight. This was on Sunday April 8th, 2018. I only had 4 dollars of cash on me and 5 in my bank account so I went to kroger and did cash back to get 8 bucks. So I pulled into the drive thru at 11 03 PM. I have worked in the restaraunt industry most of my life and I always try not to come to a place within 30 minutes of close, but I think an hour is pretty reasonable. So I pulled up to the speaker and began to wait. A couple minutes went by and I pulled forward to see what was going on. I saw a customer at the drive thru window so I figured they were busy with him and pulled back to the speaker. I continued to wait. After 5 minutes another car pulled behind me. They waited about 10 minutes before finally leaving. Then 15 minutes in another car pulled behind me. I honked. so waited a couple more minutes and honked 3 
times, the other car still waiting too. After 20 minutes I finally pulled forward to the window to see a black man and woman. The woman shouted \"closed!!!\" and then quickly got out of view. I get it I work in restaraunts and though I have never done it myself I understand the desire to close early and that's cool. But to let customers sit and wait for over 20 minutes when they could simply come on the speaker and say they are closed is absolutely disrespectful and the worst customer service I have seen in my entire life."}
{"text":"Never been to Popeye's before.  Newbie.  Ordered 3-piece combo with mashed spuds and my coworker ordered the same.  I paid and was served and off to the table I went.  Over five minutes later my coworker finally was served the exact same order I did and paid for on my bill.  Not good service!  Food itself was non memorable at best.  Dry and not flavorful.  Potatoes weren't that hot. I am in the same Winco parking lot every week to shop and admittedly the Winco deli chicken is more flavorful and moist.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Dis place sux. They refused to give me da Cajun shrimp and dat rlly ticked me off. my popEYES will never see this place again."}
{"text":"Don't like negativity but this is the 2nd bad experience at this location. Was the only person that was in there, waited 10mins for them to put the 12pc Family Meal together. I noticed there was plenty of chicken under the warmer along with biscuits. Not sure what took so long. Get home, kids are hungry and I open the cole slaw to it being less then half full. WTF!!! I'm done with this place!"}
{"text":"Popeyes is a good fast food chain. That's not what I'm reviewing here. In fact, I won't even comment on the food. This review is all about the service.

This location is only a couple minutes away from my house so I've been here more than a handful of times. Each time, the service just isn't up to par. For a fast food restaurant, I'm expecting my food in 5 minutes tops. That's what I've come to expect having been to many other locations in the past. 

For whatever reason though, this location is much slower. I've waited upwards of 20 minutes at this location for an order of chicken tenders. They try to be accommodating and apologetic by throwing in a couple of chicken tenders, but let's be honest, our time is worth more than a dollar to them. 

It just doesn't make sense how a fast food franchise can be so slow. It's not like their food is any better than other locations."}
{"text":"Wow, service sucked and one of the employees brought her kids too work and let them run around like this is a daycare!"}
{"text":"I love Popeyes, and I frequently visit various locations throughout the Valley. This particular location is super stingy on how much chicken they give you. I always get tenders and they have given me two strips in my 3 piece box, on more than one occasion. I'll definitely check before leaving the drive thru next time. Fool me once!"}
{"text":"For starters, this shithole  was dirty as all HELL. Secondly, when I go to place my order (in the drive-thru) the woman takes 3 try's to get my order correctly, and as you can tell, I was not a happy camper. When I finally pull up to the window to pay, the woman gives me a whole lot of attitude that I really was not in to. After waiting for god damned ever for my food to come out, I asked for honey mustard and BBQ sauce and they gave me ONE for a BIG BOX COMBO and 10 pc nugget. I was beyond furious. All around, would not visit this steaming pile of horse excrement if I had a gun held to my fucking head."}
{"text":"Brand new location with the worst customer service.. And their fryers are broken and down already! Not to mention dude in the drive through laughs at me for being angry.. This business needs to be ran properly.."}
{"text":"I love Popeyes but this particular establishment has cured me of my fried chicken craving... The restaurant is not clean and the cashiers are not friendly... Watch your bank account for debit card purchases because I was charged double while going through the drive thru... I asked was everything okay because it took longer than usual but was reassured everything was okay with the purchase. The chicken and sides were no where near worth paying $52.00 for... I will not be going back... Owners stop being lazy and visit your establishment... Make sure your managers and other workers are doing their jobs and serving the best interest of your company..."}
{"text":"Man, this place is a disaster now. Disgusting bathrooms, disheveled employees, sticky floors. 
But the chicken keeps me a'commin' back."}
{"text":"Spicy chicken please
Two large sides biscuits to go
Eat you with a spork"}
{"text":"$ 4 rip off the fish is small I had to go back and get the bisect and they charge for extra things like mustard and ketchup. And the fish dose not taste like real fish"}
{"text":"Love that this location is in my neighborhood.  I have been here several times, and the food is always accurate, hot, and delicious every single time.  In addition, everyone is super nice.  I have never had a single problem.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"****3.5 stars****  I've always ordered through the drive-thru and I haven't been disappointed. Their chicken is always crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I usually love their buttermilk biscuits but it's been super dry that past few times I've been there. Not sure if it's a new recipe or not but if they did change it, they need to bring the old recipe back! Regardless of the dry biscuits, I'm still coming back!"}
{"text":"Multiple visits, same experience... never again!  Missing food, long waits for items that they always seem to be \"out of at the moment\".  At least the staff wasn't as rude as they were last time.  As far as fast food goes I really like Popeyes, sad that for whatever reason this location seems to be missing the mark consistently. I would highly recommend saving your cash for other venues."}
{"text":"This is only my second time EVER at Popeye's. First time was in Guelph, and it was horrible. So much so I vowed never to eat at Popeye's ever again.

The boyfriend was craving Popeye's one day, so we went. I actually thoroughly enjoyed my meal! I ordered chicken tenders, and chicken wings for him. My tender was delicious, especially with their killer blackened ranch sauce. It was juicy, extremely tender, and perfectly seasoned. Fries looked just like KFC (only with cajun seasoning), which was actually the only part of the meal I didn't enjoy.

All in all, this Popeye's completely changed my opinion and has made me a believer. :)"}
{"text":"This location is horrible when it comes to service. Ask for an extra biscuit get charged for it then get none. Ask for spicy the guy asks again to double check and still got mild! They don't listen or follow directions for crap! Maybe it's because it's a bunch of teenagers? Who's knows but it's getting frustrating."}
{"text":"No-goodniks like to frequent this location. Unfortunately there are no-goodniks working behind the counter as well. There was one female ignoramus who refused to acknowledge me and my sister at the cash register.  First she was in the back doing stuff and then she came out and shuffled some boxes, and then returned to the back with her tom foolery.  She didn't say \"hi\" or \"just a sec,\" she said nothing to us.  She didn't even raise her unibrow to acknowledge us.  When she did that I said forget it and left.  

It doesn't even really matter anyway, this store's kind of a dump. I'll be impressed on the day that they stop showcasing their pile of giant bags of trash in the window.   They're located next to the deal of the day sign.  Isn't that ridiculous? This is a company that relies on the franchise name to bring in customers cuz otherwise, they don't give a fudge. And guess what, neither do I cuz KFC is just around the corner.

Two stars!"}
{"text":"The worst order ever. Food arrived 1 hour and 15 minutes after I ordered it. The food was cold, over cooked and oily. I used to like Popeyes Chicken, no longer. Left a bad taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet at 50.00 bucks."}
{"text":"This spot is #1.. from the bottom! They excel in all of the worse categories. Like actually having food that's on the menu, getting your order right, forgetting to bring your order out to you after being asked to pull up. If there were a Top 10 worse Popeyes restaurant contest, they would be ranked #1 for the 12 years straight. 

Avoid at all cost!! Unless you enjoy underwhelming Popeyes experiences.. 
I was forced to actually give this place a star. They should have the poop emoji.. I would've given them 5 of those."}
{"text":"It's sad. Between the commercials and friends I expected more. The flavor wasn't terrible but the 3 piece chicken was more like 3 piece Pigeon. I didn't realize chickens were so small. For the price, go anywhere else including Winco next door and buy their fried chicken. 
Truly sad."}
{"text":"I went to Popeye's almost four years ago and I had good service.

Last Saturday...no! I had to repeat my order three times, I wanted the dinner (which included pop), but I got the combo, so I had to get a pop from a hot dog vendor!

Keep this up and there'll be a new business there!"}
{"text":"Tuesday $.99 special is what it's about!!! I'm pretty sure this is where we are going for lunch today!! Their red beans and rice, dirty rice, and mashed potatoes n gravy are killer sides!!! Biscuit is ok, I think church's is better. I order my chicken spicy. Deeeeeeeeelicious!!! I can't wait to go to lunch!!"}
{"text":"Consistently worse every time ....hardest, old rubber chicken sitting under bright lights. Weird burnt, skin and hard cold biscuits. They just don't care or don't give a damn. 3pm today the beans & rice was also old and congealed and the rice wasn't cooked , hard rice.  But the employees are always nice & polite , good people but bad food...."}
{"text":"Ok let me start of saying that I love Popeyes and was super excited that one was opening close by my house. I've been here 3 times and each thine the wait was loooonnnggg. The first time I came was through drive thru. Not too bad except for the wait time. Second time I went to the counter and order the chicken meal. After waiting almost 15 minutes my number is called. I looked down at my tray and realized they gave me tenders. Immediately I bring it to their attention and they lady said hold on I need to get a a manager. Really??? I have my receipt in front of you and you can see the order is wrong. They ended up fixing the order after I had to wait another 5 minutes. As I'm sitting there looking around I realize there are 6 employees on their break eating. Don't get me wrong everyone is entitled to their break but when there is a long line of people then perhaps that many people shouldn't be able to go at once. The third time I came was in drive thru again. Omg. The girl couldn't get my order right even after repeating it 3 times. I ordered 3 separate items with the third one being a chicken strip meal. At no time did she ask me what side item I wanted or my drink. I sat there waiting to see if she would ask. She hands me the bag and tries to send me off. I ask her what about my side and drink?? Don't you want to know what I want? She said oh I rang it up as ala carte.  I looked at her and explained the whole conversation and said I wanted mash potatoes. Can she please give it to me and I'll pay for it. She ended up giving it to us for free but it still doesn't make up for the bad customer service. 

When I brought the chicken home it was a bit undercooked. 


If you want chicken and don't mind canes then go there. If you have your heart set on Popeyes then drive a little further to the one on Craig road. Trust me it will be worth the drive. This place is so new and so disorganized and the people have no clue on what they are doing. I will not be back at this location."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about Popeyes that I love so much but their chicken strips is just the right amount of crispy, flavorable and juicy. I can't even begin to describe why I think it's the best chicken strip ever! And oh my....the red beans rice....yummo. The best thing on the menu is their snack wrap because it has a chicken strip and red beans and rice wrapped in a tortilla. Perfect everything in one bite."}
{"text":"Way overpriced!!! Bought a 3 piece Spicy Chicken no flavor!!!! 

Bunch of crooks, they don't even offer refills on their sodas !!! 

Go to Wendy's next door free refills on their sodas!!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the first time i have had a mixed review about a restaurant. I decided to pull up about 20 minutes before close. ( not an unreasonable time ) and i ordered a simple 6 piece tender, with a fry and apple pie. (lol that rhymed) and they told me that they didn't have any pies or French fries left since they were too close to closin time. I was upset about it but the manager decided to hook us up with about 12 extra chicken tenders and i was stoked!! I get home, open the box to take my first bite and they were all cold. And i mean hardly warm. This whole adventure was an emotional roller coaster, although I'll be generous since i appreciate the kindness."}
{"text":"OMG!!  So SLOW!  I went through the drive through to get the 3 chicken tenders meal.  Ten minutes later, I ended up walking inside (almost totally empty) to see where lunch was.  Twelve minutes after ordering, I finally got my (NOT fresh) chicken tenders (no biscuit, although there was supposed to be one) and iced tea.  So much for a quick lunch, and it was awfully expensive for stale chicken and NO biscuit.  DO NOT go here.  WAIT . . . UPDATE . . . I DIDN'T GET MY ICED TEA EITHER!!  IT WAS DIET SODA!!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten there before but like others have said the parking is terrible.  However the staff is friendly and the chicken is always hot, tender and delicious.   We ordered delivery last night, and it came in time and again was hot, tender and delicious.  There were 6 or 7 huge pieces of chicken (we ordered spicy and regular), tonnes of french fries, I think enough for everyone on our floor, and 4 biscuits.   The chicken was perfect, tender and not over cooked.  The fries were great too but the biscuits,  well they would make great door stops.  Lots of french fries left over, so I put them into a freezer bag and threw them into the freezer.   The left over chicken, into a glass sealable container.  ( I don't like storing food in plastic containers).  Today we spent a few hours putting together a dresser bought from Ikea, so we decided to reheat the left overs.  I took part of the french fries out of the freezer, heated them up in the micro and also the chicken.  I had some rolls from Bun King Bakery in Scarborough and made some garlic bread with some cheese. Also I heated up a package of Swiss Chalet sauce and the left overs from Popeyes was delicious.  Combo of Swiss Chalet sauce and Popeyes chicken.  Yummy."}
{"text":"If I could give them negative stars I would.

I first asked for 10 pieces of chicken tenders with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy...the ignorant girl at the drive-thru said they didn't have a 10 piece combo so she couldn't serve me 10 pieces....I reiterated my question and said \"do you guys sell your chicken tenders individually?\" She said yes...I then said \"ok, so could you ring me up for an individual chicken tender 10 times on your computer?\" 
She answered \"no, because it will be more expensive this way.\" 
I asked for 10 pieces of chicken in every single way possible and I NEVER got my ten pieces of chicken. 

On top of that, the gravy was literally just gravy flavored, brown water. I didn't notice until
I got home and opened up the order...I called the store and asked them if they had changed their gravy recipe and the drive-thru attendant said to me \"no, it's just like that cause of the delivery truck...all of the Popeyes are the same right now.\" 
Which was a complete lie!! I had to finally go get my mashed potatoes and gravy at a different store and they had the original Popeyes gravy (which I find to be delicious). I simply can not believe this store was just simply watering their gravy down and then lying to customers saying all Popeyes were like that. As a franchise, they are supposed to stand behind their product and not WATER DOWN their gravy!! I would have much rather them tell me they had no gravy left than give me that nasty brown water as gravy. I am EXTREMELY disappointed. I will never be going back to ANY Popeyes. It's always something with these people."}
{"text":"I can't emphasize enough how TERRIBLE the service is here. I arrived and all employees, manager included looked like they HATED being there. 
Didn't greet me at the counter, order was wrong...simply terrible. Tables were dirty...employee looked at me and acted like it was MY fault that my order was wrong. A bunch of stuck up little Mexican girls. I am usually very please with Popeyes and spend thousands of dollars a year here. I will never come back.  
I think every job is respectable but these ladies work at Popeyes because they simply don't have the capacity to do anything else. Bunch of dumb good for nothing girls. Not even serving food. If the owner reads this...PLEASE consider hiring better staff or knocking some sense into your lazy staff sir/madam. 

Really might work for the type of people in the area but for someone who expects good customer service...this was simply a horrible experience."}
{"text":"Hot, fresh and still the champ of fast-food, fried chicken."}
{"text":"I've waited shorter amounts of time at restaurants ordering proper food than I did at this place waiting for fried chicken. Super slow customer service and food that is most of the time not ready. The chicken itself is a hit or miss - sometimes you get it properly done, other times it's cold, overly-breaded and tastes old."}
{"text":"These days Popeyes seems to spend more on advertising than they do anything else, with their ridiculous \"my fried chicken\" commercials. I remember coming here and getting really good flavorful food back in the day. Now I feel like a giant holding their  premature drumsticks! Maybe I was much younger then with smaller hands and the drumstick only appeared larger? I really don't know. Either way the price you pay for the combo meals are ridiculous, (around $7 bucks and upward)when you see the portion size. The food isn't horrible but it hasn't really progressed. I'm pretty sure I'll come back when I'm in the mood to eat a little and spend a lot."}
{"text":"The food was great as usual BUT $12 for a one piece breast meal? The airport (southwest) terminal is dirty and has never been upgraded in decades. Sad"}
{"text":"This is possibly the worst popeyes I have ever been to. Despite the bad reviews i decided to take a chance. Customer service sucked and my biscuit was cold on the inside like it wasnt cooked all the way. Nothing but kids working there. Horrible service. Then the manager hands me my box of food with no bag. What the heck?"}
{"text":"Service here is horrible.  Came in at 8pm and asked for spicy breast and the manager tells me that there are none.  The whole spicy side racks were filled with thighs and wings.  When I asked how long, I was told that they weren't making any because of all the chicken that was still up there!!  3 hrs to go and no spicy breast!  I get out of line amazed at the response and allow my friend to order.   

After a while I get back in line to order a Po'boy and I'm standing behind a guy who asks for a spicy breast meal only to be turned away with the same response I received.  He was just as amazed as I was a few minutes earlier.  2 hrs and 45 minutes to go and a cook in the back yells up to the front \"Whatever's up there!\"

Piss poor planning on their part shouldn't determine what we can order.  Sad part is they felt that it was totally fine to dictate what could be ordered and looked back at us like, \"What now?\"  

I live several miles away but there aren't any Popeye's nearby, but I'll go without before I give my money to this establishment!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over  8 yrs..  almost every Tuesday  and most weeks a second visit on Thursday to get my survival bucket of chicken for the weekend. They always have a new monthly special food product offering. Right now it is spicy packed wings. They are delicious, yummy and oh so good. The drive thru is usually quick in and out within a minute or two depending on how many cars in front of you and the staff is always friendly, courteous and expeditious. Never any complaints and if I had one it was always taken care of immediately."}
{"text":"Definitely not the best Popeye's that I've been to. Service was slower than usual and customer service was lacking. Chicken tasted as though it was a little undercooked, but seemed fine on the inside. Sad to give this location a 2 star rating as Popeye's is one of my favorite quick stops when I'm feeling a little homesick."}
{"text":"****CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE                                     THE WINDOW OR GO TO ANOTHER FRIED CHICKEN RESTAURANT THEY NEVER GET YOUR ORDER RIGHT******
Back again at the drive thru for some more chicken and again my order was incorrect. The first time and even the second time I was okay with it  but a 3rd time Really! This time we ordered 3 piece mild chicken combo with mashed potatoes and a drink. But we got the spicy chicken instead of mild. I ordered 3 piece mild chicken combo with mashed potatoes and a drink PLUS I  added a small order of beans and rice. The beans and rice were paid for and clearly on the receipt but there were no beans and rice in my order. And the kid taking our order repeated everything correctly and the receipt had everything on it exactly how we ordered it!  I didn't have time to do the baby work this time of checking my order and drove 30 minutes home before realizing they got it wrong AGAIN!.  Wonder if someone is trying to sabotage the company. It's the worse run business in town. NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"By far the worst Popeyes I've ever had in my life. This place gives a stain to the Popeyes name. The people working there should be fired and the building demolished. The food was stale and lukewarm like it had been sitting there all day. The employees were children joking and playing around.  Popeyes was my favorite chicken restaurant. I will never eat at any Popeyes again ever because of such a horrible experience. DISGUSTING!"}
{"text":"Been waiting here since around 12:15. It is now 12:50. Nevermind being told to park in the parking lot because I guess 15 minutes waiting in line after placing my order wasn't enough time to drop any chicken. Not to mention the crappy attitude I'm always given when simply ordering as if the employees hate their job. You don't want to be here, don't. Find another place that makes you happy. Don't put a damper in my day because you have an issue."}
{"text":"First time eating Popeye's. Very clean. I ordered the $5 meal they've been advertising, with one spicy and one regular, and slaw, and comes with a drink and biscuit. They brought it to me which was nice. Food wise - it was good. I still feel KFC has better flavors in the chicken. The mild had no real flavor other than the fried taste and the spicy had a bite to it. Biscuits are good, have kind of a salty top, although I had to go ask for butter. The slaw was good, creamy and sweet. Overall it was good, not sure I would eat here again though."}
{"text":"Spicy

Popeye's Rules!"}
{"text":"They have good chicken and bomb biscuits when fresh. I just hate the service and paying for sauce. I mean I just bought a 12 pc bucket can I have atleast one sauce? I understand if I didn't buy chicken but whatever lol end rant."}
{"text":"Gross. Dry. Cold. Cheap tasting meat and sides.  Literally was hard to chew the chicken.  More like jerky."}
{"text":"AMAZING SERVICE. Me and my family came in real late but they welcomed us and served us regardless. Honestly thanks so much!"}
{"text":"First time checking in, been here a few times though. This location is good. Friendly associates and the Asian manager is awesome and accommodating. Used to go to the location over on LV Blvd but I will come to this one from now one on. Food and service is much better at this Henderson location."}
{"text":"Who manages this place? There's always at least 20 people working. It's always dirty. It's always slow service. If you're white you will be treated badly. The chicken sits out for long periods of time. This place is an absolute mess."}
{"text":"Don't really enjoy popeyes that much but overall experience was awesome. My boyfriend had a craving for it so I got it for him. The girl that took my order was patience, happy, genuine, and professional. Love the interior design of the location. Again I'm not a fan of popeyes but I can always give an opinion to awesome service. Great job."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from here a few times as well as picked up food in store. The last two times the food hasn't been very good. Fries are soggy, onion rings are cold and the chicken upset my stomach. Won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"This Popeye chicken got my order wrong twice the food was cold on the last order the service was terrible I am so upset I can't believe I paid nine dollars for what I got. I would not go there again.  I wouldn't feed my dogs their food. Stay away from this one maybe they're all getting this bad I haven't been to him in a long time and I won't goback again."}
{"text":"Fuck Popeyes  they fucked up my order and had to go back twice to fix it and in the end it still wasn't right. Manager was rude AF and the lemonade tasted like water wtf I didn't pay $15 to get this kind of service. Fuck that fat white bitch. Never again!"}
{"text":"Worse place you can ever go to honestly worst customer service. I've never had this bad experience until now. Forgot to offer sauce and wrong drink plus no straw !"}
{"text":"Worst Popeyes location. The staff need their attitudes checked. Plus they overcharged me, and argued with me despite the signage clearly stating otherwise. Definitely won't be back to this particular location again."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location now for about as long as they've been open which is been like maybe a few months. The service is always been very good. No complaints in that department. But I will say that tonight July 2nd 2017 was the best night and best experience I've had at this location.

I'm ordering food for my family for dinner tonight because nobody felt like cooking. They were upfront and honest with me about how long it would take because I had a special request. Rosie the assistant manager on duty tonight not only brought out my food for me, but also thank me for my patience and was very very personable with me and made me feel like a valued customer. Her staff was very very nice and very very courteous as well.

Thank you Rosie and the Popeyes staff tonight for making my dinner for me and my family and like you said Rosie, you treat people how you want to be treated. You did exactly just that. Cheers to you all"}
{"text":"Good ol' popeyes! 

The location here was pretty good. I ordered the 12 piece meal with fries and mashed potatoes. 

The chicken was good as usual and they were the perfect size. Loved that it wasn't too oily. The cajun fries here were a bit soggy and not quite to my liking. Mashed potatoes were bomb. 

Overall experience was good and I will be coming back again for my fried chicken fix."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. They have the worst customer service and dont know a thigh from a breast. We waited 20 mins for our orders to be told they forgot and that drive thru is priority. We finally received old chicken and cold stale fries. Asked for fresh food and was given more cold food with no apologizes. Finally asked for money back and the manager threw that at us. BE WARNED FIND SOME PLACE ELSE TO EAT!!"}
{"text":"This place has had 3 times to redeem itself. Everytime Ive ordered food and gotten home and the chicken is not fully cooked. The management is beyond rude when you call to tell them.  Hell I'm sure if mine wasn't done someone else got half cooked chicken too. Raw chicken equals salmonella."}
{"text":"My dirt button is crying mere ten minutes after ingesting your \"food\". I feel like I was worn as a hand puppet. Eating from a trash bin is a safer bet. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Have this love-hate relationship with Popeyes. I love the taste. Love the chicken. Good service. Hate the fact I feel ripped off everytime I go. 10 piece special, mixed pieces but NO breasts. Legs and thighs. White meat consisted of 2 wings and 2 ribs. Cole slaw wasn't even a full container."}
{"text":"I love their food, it's really good it's better than church's or kfc in my opinion. I would give this location 4 stars but the customer service sucks! I give 2 stars because of how their policy works. 

It was Easter Sunday and I had to get some food to go to bring at my friends house all the way to Gilbert. I ordered 8pcs chicken, NO BISCUITS, a side of cajun fries and 3 pcs chicken tender. I find it very convenient to just go through the drive thru because I was in a hurry. So I don't have time to check the bag/box if my order was right, I believe as a customer it's the employees responsibility to check if they gave me the right food. Anyway to make the story short I got to my friends house to find out I was given 4 biscuits and no chicken tenders. I was upset because the chicken tenders was supposed to be for the kids and they weren't able to eat and just had fries because they messed up on my order. 

Just like the other reviews I went back and spoke with the manager the next day because I wasn't able to go back and corrected them as I went all the way to Gilbert and came home late that Sunday. The manager told me I had to return the food that was purchased so they can give me a refund plus the item that was missing. Go figure! I don't understand their policy at all! It was very inconvenient. If the food here wasn't good I won't come back!"}
{"text":"Don't go to this location... always out of something..7:30pm and out of cajun rice lazy workers and managers don't care at all.. order a 10pcs.. and all i got was wings and a few breast.. no dark meat.. unreal this location go to other location they have all.. this location sucks management should get fired unreal and unacceptable.. lazy period.."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about this popeye's. They don't let you substitute your side dishes. Unlike the regular popeye's \"if you don't want your biscuit you can substitute for more mashed potatoes.\" Food is greasy you know how it is with fry food. While \"Till next time my food lover.. till next time.\""}
{"text":"Decided to have Popeyes after seeing the facebook offer for a free large side with purchase of a family meal. Went in thinking there would be no issues... I was wrong. I ordered the 12 piece family meal and showed the man at the counter the email offer which states right at the top of the email \"To use this offer show this email\", then he refused and said they don't accept it and then said I needed a physical coupon... I went along with it and ordered anyways, asked for half spicy half mild...no spicy pieces found. Also no ketchup/hot sauce was provided... cheap location bad service... never go here."}
{"text":"this is the closest Popeyes from where I live for a while now and I always come back here, service is relatively quick. they forgot our biscuits once on a takeout order so we called in and the manager told us to let them know next time we visit, we went back like a month later and we still got our free biscuits."}
{"text":"Yo. This was good af, OR SO I THOGHUT. Yeah, the inside is pretty, okay sure. The food good then I feel a rumbly in my somavh! I went to the bath room right away and had a very watery poop, I was certainly CONTAMINATED from the chicken!"}
{"text":"BAAAAAAAD customer service EVERY time I end up @ this joint!  It's not my fault that you hate your job or your life or both, so I don't need all of your stank attitude projected on me!  All a sista wanted was a 3 piece! don't mean the good Michael Jackson type of bad, I'm talkin' 'bout the what's that funky smell bad!  The red beans & rice are a joke now, and only the skin is seasoned.  I recommend Harold's over Popeye's ANY day."}
{"text":"While I am a fan of this location, I usually stop on my way to work to buy some dinner. Lately it seems they cannot get an order right to save their lives. For example today, I ordered a 3 piece with mild, all dark meat and green beans. What I got was the chicken and red beans and rice. My previous stop I asked for a 4 piece dinner, mild, all dark meat, what I received was a 4 piece dinner with a leg, thigh, breast and wing. Since wings and breast are white meat and I do not eat white meat chicken because of the dryness of the meat, I had to toss out 2 of the 4 pieces. I also called the Manager Siah, that day and she said to bring back the receipt and tell them to give me two additional pieces, I guess to make things right. But I have not been back until today and could not locate my receipt any longer. I wonder how many others get the wrong items?"}
{"text":"This place is just messed up. Maybe you'll get your food eventually.  Probably not. If the drunks don't kill you first. Why am I still here waiting for my food 30 minutes after ordering?  I see trays upon trays of chicken back there. What are they doing?"}
{"text":"Combination chicken fast food joint and gas station? Yessss! It's so convenient when I need to fill my car and my stomach! Joking aside this Popeye's isn't bad. Pretty much what you expect if you like their chicken. All of the workers seem really nice here too, they normally let you know if they have any specials but I would be sure to ask them just in case. And while you're waiting for your food you can just pop in the gas station store (they're connected). If not, they also have a drive-thru."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE!!! Where do I start....

The ghetto girl on the register with the tattoo on her neck and all over her arms is SO rude!!! I asked her a question about the shrimp and she flat out IGNORED me. She was standing in front of the register so it's not like she didn't hear me. I asked her again and said HELLLLOOO she never even looked at my face she was looking off to the side. She was literally the rudest person I've ever encountered in fast food... 

The spicy chicken tenders I ordered were so HARD and DRY I could not eat them! The drink machine was FILTHY so I opted against even using my cup.

OMG The restroom made me want to vomit it was SOOOOO GROSS, DISGUSTING, NASTY, FILTHY!!! I should have taken a picture to post here but I ran out so fast I was nauseated!!

I left this place so disgusted i didn't even want to go ask for a refund! So...rude cashier, hard dry chicken, nasty drink machine, filthy restroom! These are all things you can expect here."}
{"text":"Slow. Almost all drink options were out in the machine and cashier knew about it.  Have to get napkins from counter, waited five minutes after going back for napkins and restaurant was not very busy."}
{"text":"Popeye's chicken, no matter where you purchase it, is as addictive as the crack you can buy just  a few blocks away.  This restaurant only sells chicken and yet they are always out of tenders, wraps, and pieces when I arrive.  How is this possible?   Answers range from late delivery, the product is still frozen to we just don't have it.  Really, you only have to do one thing.  Don't get me wrong.  I love the chicken I just think they could use new management."}
{"text":"I was excited to find a Popeyes here is AZ. The ones I used to go to in Louisiana were good. They had etouffee and mardi gras cheesecake that were great. This one is awful. The chicken was old and not fresh. The red beans and rice were runny. It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign."}
{"text":"I agree with the majority of the reviews about this location. The chicken is absolutely delicious! And if you prefer dark meat, the \"Tuesday Special\" can't be beat (leg & thigh for $1.69!). The problem with this restaurant is the lackadaisical staff and the lack of management. My visit last night was the rule, not the exception: Inattentive staff, slow response time to even be recognized that you are standing at the counter waiting to order, long waits for food, and more \"play time\" among the staff then time spent serving the customers. This restaurant presents the ultimate quandary - do you subject yourself to terrible service and \"attitude\" from the employees, in order to reward yourself with the best chicken in town?"}
{"text":"Honestly this is the most disgusting Popeyes location I've ever been too. The entire staff is full of 16 year olds who could care less about their jobs. You can't get a meal without something being wrong in the order and more often than not the food tastes stale. I've had times where my chicken actually tasted like bleach. I would not recommend this Popeyes to anybody. 

Update they still suck"}
{"text":"If I could give zero starts I would. So I'm on the website for this location and it has a section where you can look at the coupons well I pull the 5 tenders 2 sides and 2 biscuits for 6.99. And then as I tell them I have a coupon they guy at the window disappears comes back and notifies me that I need to have it printed off. No where on the coupon does it say that it needs to be printed off. Then Joshua the manage proceeds to tell me that only that location needs a print out cause that's what the owners require. Then when I ask for corporates number I get an email cause they don't have a phone number. So I get a corp name Guy and a gm name Rachel. And a email of mgr12145@ameriancompany.com. I'm sorry but this was a huge waste of my time driving out of my way. If they need it printed out then it should be clarified. The customer is right motto does not apply here they rather lose a customer then accommodate. Never will I be back here again and this is my fault for not staying on my side of town where this hasn't and never would have happened to me."}
{"text":"The best location I've been to. Great service, fast too (as fast as they cook it fresh, often to order!). No complaints even once, we are regulars. 
+++ place is clean"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of fried chicken so probably why I rate this place so low. The biscuit and fries were really good, but found the chicken way to greasy for me.I loved the skin which was really really crispy but just couldn't finish the three pieces the grease was too much, felt a little ill. I'm sure anybody who enjoys fried chicken will love popeyes just not for me."}
{"text":"Great for fried chicken fix. Food was fresh staff is friendly.  Dining room super clean."}
{"text":"Smokes McD's.  I tried the new Tabasco Chicken Tenders, with an extremely flaky, crunchy coating.  Just the right amount of spice, and the tenders were ultra juicy and, well, tender!  Seeing as I stopped in just after the lunch hour, they were extra generous and slipped me an extra piece of chicken.

For a side, the Red Beans and Rice was a nice treat, and the biscuits are as good as Red Lobster's.  That's great, because there is no Red Lobster anywhere nearby, so I can suppress my biscuit craving more easily.

For desert, I tried the Apple Pie.  Similar to McD's, it is a pocket pastry, but much flakier, and coated in brown sugar and cinnamon.  As with any take out place, check your order.  They forgot to put my dipping sauce in the bag, but truthfully, the tenders tasted great without!"}
{"text":"The chicken was hot and spicy but they do not take American Express.  I will not ever return to Popeye's as this is the second one that does not take it.  They always spout some stuff about AmX charging too much but if customers don't return how much do they lose?  I use it for business and they take care of me with great services and I will not frequent an establishment that will not take care of it's customers.  Bye, Popeye!"}
{"text":"Busy place. Nice big portions. But one thing...Please clean your floor...You feel the stickiness and ickiness at your feet."}
{"text":"This is my local favourite fried chicken stop! Been here several times this year. Love their chicken, fries, and mash! Always excellent service with a smile! You can't go wrong with POPEYES in Stouffville!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst place I have eaten. I have given this place 6 attempts to get it together. The staff is unmotivated and clueless. The manager is clueless, hides when there is a complaint, he bounces around with his \"man bun\" trying to be every employee's buddy while the let the ship sink. 
They are always out of food. After waiting 20 min, they tell me it will be a 20 min wait for spicy, but they have mild. 20 min ago it was a 20 min wait for mild. Out is sweet tea at the self serve, ask an employee if they are making some, she states \" I don't know \" and just stands there.  Finally get some dry cold chicken, that I waited 30 min for (never did get spicy), they give me a breast even tho I ordered all dark meat. I take the breast back and she takes it out of the box and puts it back on the rack to resale. 
Place was dirty and every time the restroom stinks and is filthy."}
{"text":"Like every other review has mentioned, this location will never (and I truly mean never) get your order correct. ? the food is tasty, it would just be nice to actually receive what I pay for."}
{"text":"I almost never give one star, but this location completely deserves that! I have been here on multiple occasions and the staff and service is usually f****** s***** today was the last straw I'm never going back to this pathetic excuse for a restaurant. The guy who does the drive thru, acts like he's doing you a big f****** favor just for taking your order. Half the time he doesn't even listen and  you have to repeat the order three or four times. Most the time they forget the sauce and or other items like a drink or biscuit or something. Whenever you ask them to repeat something or for their help, you can tell from their tone of voice that they have a f*** you type of attitude. Obviously they hate their job, and I hate their service, so I'm never going back, the other Popeye restaurants are nice, this one in particular f****** sucks"}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood around lunch time and had a craving for chicken. With two chicken chains in such close proximity, it was basically a coin toss. Aside from some confusion at the window regarding the beverages, the service was ok. I opted for spicy chicken tenders, and added a little hot sauce. The tenders were good, but didn't travel really well. I am sure they would have been much better had we dined in. The red beans and rice was tasty and I was kind of impressed with the cole slaw. I wouldn't make a special trip from home, as it's just too far away. However, I would not hesitate to return if ever I am in the neighborhood again."}
{"text":"This is a second home for my kids, everything we have to dine out, this is their favourite spot. Awesome food, friendly crew, neat and delicious servings. We also take away a lot from this location so their usual order ready time is 40 minutes which might seem long sometimes but we can live with that as long as the food is right as ordered and fresh! Their spicy sandwiches are our family favourite- must try."}
{"text":"My family loves Popeyes! Once in awhile we stop in and order take out! We were visiting the S. Durango location but it was always a nightmare! Orders are always wrong and they tell you to come back and get the right \"whatever\"! Sometimes we do sometimes we just want them to know that our orders are always wrong. Anyway went to S. Rainbow location tonight, placed our order and drove home. Of course my mashed potatoes are red beans and rice. I call the store and they tell me to come back! I don't want to....get my order right, just once....please? So anyway we have them many opportunities to get it right. We will miss our splurge but we are done."}
{"text":"I love Popeyes, being a driver I eat at them all over the country at this location I got the chicken strips and cajun fries.... dear sweet Jesus I have never shit so much in my life I might as well have eaten a box of ex-lax, 30 minutes after eating I had cramps so bad I thought I might be going into labor"}
{"text":"I was asked to pull over and wait on my chicken with the other half of my food getting cold! Not happy!"}
{"text":"The food was good per usual at Popeyes however the service was lackluster. They were very slow to help, I stood at the counter for about 5 minutes trying to get some ranch before anyone acknowledged me, they even made eye contact with me several times, they were all to busy conversing with each other, which in turn made my food cold by the time I got back to eat it. The cashier had a hard time putting our order in, and there was another lady complaining about the shrimp they gave her. Overall not impressed."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of spice, you'll like Popeyes. I always get spicy tenders, green beans and sometimes red beans and rice. All are flavorful and spicier than Bojangles. I love the blackened ranch dipping sauce which I also put on my biscuit. They also have a Coke Freestyle machine which gives you lots of drink options. 

Service at this location is hit or miss. The last time I went, staff was friendly,  it was clean and service was fast. Another time I visited it was the opposite. Staff was rude, service was slow, the Coke machine hardly had any flavors and tables were messy. So the two star is because I never know what kind of service to expect.

It's a place I only go if I have a once in a while craving for chicken tenders."}
{"text":"the chicken was delicious. service was very friendly and the girl who I dealt with gave me a ton of great sauces when I asked her to surprise me. usually the surprise is a disappointing low number of sauces if I ask the same question. great job popeyes"}
{"text":"For the second time this week they did not have any chicken ready that didn't require a 15 minute wait. I mean your business is chicken how do you not have any available especially during lunch and dinner times??
Fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me there won't be a third time"}
{"text":"I've only been inside once but been through the drive-thru a few times. Food is consistent. Staff is friendly. Reasonably fast."}
{"text":"So I have always been a fan of Popeyes Chicken strips.  I ended up getting their chicken for the family.  I got a mixture of the Spicy and regular.  Chicken was dry, seemed very old.  Limited types of side.  Their biscuits do come with honey, but even the biscuits seemed dry.  The quality of chicken was not what I expected at all.  The price also seemed very high.  For fried chicken,  I will be going back to Church's or El Pollo Loco for grilled."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch after the gym, the best time for high caloric intake :) Popeye's is consistently the best fried chicken and this location did not disappoint. So fresh, juicy and hot and I love the mashed potatoes with the spicy cajun gravy!! I was told by an employee that the owner of this location is building 40 more around The Valley and a couple that will be close to me near Tatum and Greenway. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, excellent spicy chicken, used an entertainment coupon for bogo free meal.  Restaurant could use a deep cleaning as its quite aged. But love their spicy chicken tenders with extra Louisiana hot sauce."}
{"text":"A newly opened franchise in Surprise. I have been wanting to visit the chain and finally got a chance to do it. Disappointingly, they don't have collard greens, but the green beans were pretty tasty. Also ordered thee spicy fried chickens and they were good also (although they were in a smaller size compared to KFC). Will try fish or shrimp for the next visit."}
{"text":"It's Tuesday, you'd expect it to be busy and everyone coming to get chicken. How you have a 25 minute wait for chicken? Should've been on top of things from the jump. The guy at the window was super nice but I ain't trynna wait 25 minutes bruh!"}
{"text":"Bad service. They were backed up on orders when i came in and the lobby wasn't even full. Had 3-4 employees just standing in there. Lobby and restrooms looked like they hadn't been cleaned all day. With the amount of staff youd think one of them could check on the cleanliness of their establishment. Out of sauce and out of sweet tea. You'll probably get better service with another location."}
{"text":"This place is awful awful. They don't have the Tuesday special. I've seen customers who waited for there order for over 30mins. I sat there eatting my meal wondering what the heck did these customers order that's taking so long while I'm done eatting my meal. I been here once and that will be my last time because there's no Tuesday special."}
{"text":"Ive heard so much good stuff about Popeyes, and I must say they were not lies. The chicken served here is great for it to be a fast food place. I would say its much better than KFC hands down. I had the chicken sandwich, with a side order of fries and I was not disappointed. The price was also reasonable. The area was also clean and welcoming inside. The staff are pretty nice as well, they had smiles on their faces and we're happy to serve. I would come here often if only I lived Toronto. I guess every time I come, I will have to make a stop here. Well, until next time."}
{"text":"Second time I tried here, the order was wrong and more fried skin on the chicken than meat , would go elsewhere, definitely exclamation point"}
{"text":"Yes I am writing a review for Popeye's, don't judge me. 

For the first 26 years of my life I had no real care for fried chicken, but then I moved to the big old city and my world was forever changed. 

Um HELLO you delicious-juicy-hot-spicy-artery-clogging piece of fried chicken! Ohhh and those buttery biscuits! 

Sooooo bad for you, but ooooohh so good!"}
{"text":"I love popeyes chicken , but this location just doesnt stand up to the same type of service and food i have always recieved.  First off the employees were too busy sitting around and chitt chatting with each other , than worrying about their customers.  On top of that we ordered a BASIC meal 3 chicken strips fries and a drink.  However the 6 orders behind us were filled first , then ours....  how is this possible ?  Then once we recieved the food , it just did not taste good.   Luckily i do not live near this place and will not have to go again."}
{"text":"Horrible service and slow to boot. The only reason they get 2 stars is that they're close to my house and the food is delicious. But I won't be coming back just because they let the lines get too full too easy. And they don't want to smile or pretend like they care. Plus the area it's in brings in the less-than-comfortable crowd."}
{"text":"Mediocre. The spicy chicken simply isn't. It's normal, nothing to write (Yelp) about. Soft drink size inadequate and typically over-priced. 

The pricing is not cheap but a little more than it should be. For only two, it was $24.61. 

But today, after I spoke to the person at the initial drive thru and ordered at 6:04 pm, I pulled up, paid, and then she says, \"It'll be 5 minutes.\" Hmm, okay, no stock on hand during the dinner hour. Definitely not fast. Could you have informed me as I first ordered?"}
{"text":"During lunch, and it wasn't crowded, I ordered a 2 piece spicy dark combo with Cajun rice. What I got was 2 piece spicy white with Cajun fries. I informed the server and got my meal corrected. They gave me the fries. Overall a great way to fix a problem"}
{"text":"Fun Fact - This particular Popeyes is right across to the Lamps Plus which I procured some light bulbs and lamps. That Lamps Plus was pretty awesome, not awesome-sauce because they sell lamps and lighting accessories and not Barbecue sauce. Perhaps awesomely-bright.

Anyhow, let's talk about Popeyes.

Have you ever been to a Popeyes? It's just like that.  Spicy chicken all the way!!  It did not disappoint.  I can't frequent Popeyes too often because it hits me pretty hard later, not because they don't make quality food, but simply because my fragile intestinal track converts all the grease, fried stuff, and deliciousness into waste that's in liquid form.  

Other than that the food is delicious.

But really that Lamps Plus is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Really strange, but when they first opened the food was excellent and the crew was upbeat and professional.
The chicken strips were huge and delicious, I mean 2 pieces would fill me up and it was great!
Then it happend, nose dive! the service is poor, they've given me the wrong order twice in one month.
I would order chicken strips and get fried chicken instead. I would have to go back to get my order right.
The worst is the chicken strips are truly some kind of strip, thin and greasy. Why were they so good when they first opened?
The friendly bayou music is gone, the smiling faces are gone, the quality of food is gone and I am gone too."}
{"text":"Why is this location even open? The worst customer service ever. Ordering seemed like a huge inconvenience for the lazy cashier. Get on food stamps instead of working you worthless bum."}
{"text":"Whoever is working the window right now, 6:45 pm on 7|29 is a peach! Receipt says Ambri? Thanks for being a doll! Nicest person I've met at this location."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed coming to this particular location just because of the portion size. If you are dining in these workers will always be generous when dropping fries on your meal. I always get the 2 piece meal with a biscuit and fries and try my best to get something other than a thigh or leg. I don't know why it is always such a hassle at KFC or popeyes to just get a chicken breast and a wing. It's a damn wing..do your job and pop one with my meal please. The biscuit at popeyes is great and makes for a salty doughy side to your chicken. The chicken is always tender and tasty and has enough spice for a spicy meal. By the end of your combo you are usually feeling like unbuckling your pants and taking a nap as it is carb loaded and very filling however when you are craving some fried chicken and biscuits you can not go wrong with Popeyes!"}
{"text":"Only 4 stars cause it's a chicken place. But it was  a great representation of Popeyes experience"}
{"text":"Got a craving for fried chicken at 9:50PM. Every place I looked at said they closed at 10PM. Then I found this place was open until 11PM. It was a 20 minutes drive but that craving was a strong one. I arrived about 10:30PM, drove up to the menu and.... nothing. No one said anything. Not even to say sorry, they're closed... Waste of gas and time."}
{"text":"So, I've been to one other Popeye's before in my life and it was a good experience. Fast service, great customer service, and very helpful. I walked out of WinCo the other day and smelled fresh biscuits (a major weakness of mine) so headed on over to the drive thru. Three minutes, nothing. I say, \"I guess not\" to which I hear a female voice say \"Hang on\". There was no one else in the drive thru and only maybe 3 cars in the parking lot. I reversed out of the drive thru and headed inside. Two people with headsets were no where near a register, the girl on her phone. The guy in the back on the food line was busy stuffing his mouth and chuggin his drink while preparing food which seems unsanitary and possibly against food prep code, especially since he wasn't wearing gloves (yes there's a quickly snapped photo). Eventually, I was ui acknowledged (again, no one in the drive thru and the one other person at the counter was only waiting on food) and ordered my food, Watching this dude in the back the entire time just eating and prepping food. When I got my food, it was all room temperature and how can you call it spicy when it doesn't even burn your mouth with the spices? I can look past the spicy part because I love chicken regardless but the temperature of the food, the customer service, and the balatant disregard for food handler's rules and regulations.... Yeah, I'm definitely never going back to this location.

Maybe one day I'll hit up a Popeyes again because it's a hit and a miss, it's just this one is definitely not giving the chain a good rep."}
{"text":"I love me done chicken! After watching undercover boss I had a hankering to get some yummy grub. Sad to say tho this place is not the cleanest I would have hoped for. The bathroom smelled horrible. The food was good, but not overly exiting. Will return but hope it is a little cleaner in the future"}
{"text":"Thought the service was nice and fast, but I'm pretty sure my chicken tenders were raw. This happened to me before at another location.  Not a pleasant experience if you know what I mean...

They were also hot and super hard on the inside, but cold in the middle. Like fridge cold in the middle. I don't believe I will be returning to any Popeyes."}
{"text":"We went there around lunch time and ordered the 20$ meal. The chicken was tasted very stale, old and awful. I will NEVER eat here again. I would also advise anyone that goes there to check your food prior to driving off."}
{"text":"This place is amazing....keep up the wonderful work....great speedy customer  service...excellent quality of food....im here at least 2 times a week....see you soon!!!!"}
{"text":"They're open. Dropped by today after work and had the deluxe chicken sandwich. The service was prompt and polite. Not too busy. The sandwich was a mixed bag. The chicken was flavourful and tender, but the bun, Lettie and tomatoes were ice cold. The bun was also dry and stale.

Please fix the sandwich! It has potential but the bread just needs to be heated and fresher. Will try again in a few weeks to see if there's any improvement."}
{"text":"This Popeyes had no urgency. One employee took the rest of the fries and never let the cook know. Then my order was being bagged and she needed fries. I watched this whole thing. Thru all are walking around like they have all the time in the world. I came on my lunch break and I'm waiting 15-20 min for 2 pieces of chicken, corn and fries unexceptionable! Don't come if your in a rush."}
{"text":"I was wanting Popeyes for a long time and decided to finally go.  I got a 3 piece spicy and 1 side.  The chicken was a little dry and the crust was ok.  Coleslaw, ok.  I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"I usually wouldn't write a review about fried chicken chain restaurants, but they're ROTD worthy so maybe this is relevant. I'm usually under the impression that this is better than the other two large chains, but this particular location leaves me inclined to change my mind. Maybe their heat lamps are busted or something, because my food was not far beyond room temperature as well as dried out, with seasoning dumped on indiscriminately. 

I don't even have high expectations for a place like this, but it manages to give me the impression that no one there really gives a shit, and they coast on the franchise name alone. I will eat literally anything on this intersection except for this particular restaurant."}
{"text":"it seems like there is always something missing from my order, I have went there about 3 times since they opened for work. I should of checked the boxes I know but they took longer than I have to get the food out to me. Also asked for sauce they told me it was in to box, got back to work there was no sauce! Also went in during a busy time and the manager was sitting there eating ( yes I know that everyone needs a break and should get one) but you would think that they would plan their break at a different time then lunch time.
The chicken I got this time was rubber! it wouldn't even break apart!!
will not be going back to try again after the 3 time of something always being wrong I won't try again."}
{"text":"We had never been to Popeye's before this location opened but have had awful experiences at KFC so thought we would try it.  We have gone multiple times and have never had a bad experience.  We have done the drive through a couple of times and went inside the others.  Our order has never been wrong and on all but one occasion everyone has  been friendly and polite.  On that one occasion the store was packed and they were trying to get orders out so I can't blame them for that one.  Food is always hot and good.  Yes, it is greasy but it is fried chicken, I expect a little greasy.  Biscuits are really good as well.  We will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"I used to get Popeyes all the time when I lived in the south, but the ones here were always disappointing. I decided to try this newish location near me because I was craving spicy fried chicken. I was hopeful they had gotten better this month since most bad reviews were in July when they first opened. The chicken was hot and cooked correctly, but pieces were on the small side especially the drumsticks. Taste was better than it used to be here, but not as spicy as would get in South because they seem to bland it down for here. Biscuits were way salty but good texture. Dirty rice was nice to see again since last time I tried they said they didn't sell it anymore, this was years ago. It tasted pretty good of what it should be, just suggest to fluff it out of container and reheat for minute to work out the excess moisture. 

Would try again and hopefully get bigger pieces when chicken crisis is over."}
{"text":"Really liking this new location. I thought it was funny that they opened up right across the parking lot from a huge fitness center.  :) 

It's a chain. If you like Popeyes, then you know what you're getting. Sometimes I crave the stuff. Their fast food fried chicken is leaps and bounds above that other popular chicken chain. Even their sides and biscuits are superior. This location is nice and clean. Service is good. There are a few minor kinks. Just make sure you get any sauces you ask for. In the drive through, they forgot our straws once. Had to ask for them, but not a big deal. Overall, good place for fast food fried chicken."}
{"text":"Absolutely crap! drenched in heavy amount of oil, very expensive, not worth it, as for the rest of the menu no different still crap! highly not recommend."}
{"text":"This Popeyes was a hot-mess. First time trying Popeyes and it was just not made with love. You could hear the staff talking about how the batter was messed up so things were not cooking right.  We ordered the fish and popcorn shrimp, chicken nuggets, chicken strips and a regular order of fried chicken. The fish was this rubbery yellowish orange-ish stick and the batter was not cooked on the inside. The chicken strips came as this long strand of sickly chicken blops stuck together that made up this web of funky mystery meat. The regular chicken had more bones than meat and looked dehydrated. The nuggets were great because we told staff we would wait the six min. for them to make more. Biscuits were dense and salty, and the mac and cheese side was forgettable. On top of everything they got our order wrong, it was comical at that point.
Yes! This Popeyes was hooked on to a Circle K! And expectations were low going in, but if they take your money, and call themselves an eating establishment, then they should at least be able to pull it together in some sense. Over all I wish I could give this joint a half star because an entire one is too generous. PS. Bring Tums!"}
{"text":"For Popeyes, this place is very nice. The restaurant was clean, the spicy chicken was actually spicy, customer service was friendly. They gave my dad  a senior discount and discounted the total. Missing sweet potato pies. I don't know why so many people have ranked this place so low. Maybe I lucked out."}
{"text":"I like Popeye 's Chicken. I'd like it a whole lot better if the prices were more in
line with what you receive. Spendy for what you get,  in essence. If I drop $10
for a quick lunch, I shouldn't still be hungry after I eat it, just sayin '. Got something
to say to Popeye 's - Pollo Mobile 2 - because That's  where I'm going next time
I have a chicken craving. Popeye 's is a big fat burn."}
{"text":"Popeyes yes that's right Popeyes, after recently relocating from Chicago to Phoenix I wanted some fried chicken and Popeye's is what I like. Now Fried chicken competition is pretty stiff in the Chi you have Harold's, Uncle Remus, and Mac Arthur's but here in Phoenix I am not so sure of the local spots. There are not many Popeyes locations near my current residences but ahhh.... one is near my work location. Score and this one has the \"Tuesday Special\" 2 pieces - leg and thigh for only .99 cents. Talk about an awesome deal, especially if you like dark meat which I do.  I did the drive thru cause I wanted to get home on the 51 before the traffic got bad and the window person was very nice and efficient. This is now my chicken spot here in AZ unless you know of another one that can get me tasty and spicy chicken I can't be persuade differently."}
{"text":"Today (08/22/16) was the grand opening for Popeyes Chicken by my home in Goodyear and I had to give it a try. If you can believe it, this guy has never been to a Popeyes and was pretty stoked to try it.  Popeyes has my two favorites: chicken tenders and Coke and I thought for sure I would give them five stars. Now before I give my thoughts, I need to state that I am a Chickfila fanatic. I live at Chickfila, I sell others on Chickfila, and I could literally eat there for every meal of the day. So my standards are high when it comes to the chicken fast food experience. With all that said, I really enjoyed the Popeyes food but the customer service was average at best. With today being day one, I expected employees with enthusiasm and that they would be on top of things. That was not the case. The young lady handling the drive thru lacked much personality and kept wanting me to finish my order after each item I selected. So after arriving home with the families grub I was very frustrated to see we were shorted on the chicken tender dipping sauces. Like we literally were missing half our requested sauces. To me, chicken tender sauce is vital and I can not stand eating without it.  Now for the food, it did not disappoint. The tenders were tender, juicy and very flavorful. We tried both, regular and spicy and enjoyed both.  The sauces (1 sweet heat and 1 mardi gras mustard) I did have were great. The sweet heat was the winner and one of the better dipping sauces I have had. For sides, we had the green beans and mashed potatoes and liked them both. The order also came with a biscuit and I did enjoy the one bite I had.  This yelper is trying to watch calories and I had to draw the line somewhere.  I did want to scarf the whole thing though after that one bite.  Overall, I will try them again and if the service is good, I have no problem giving them the four stars they are capable of having. I will continue to leave my 5 stars for Chickfila but Popeyes is a good backup. JUST DON'T FORGET MY SAUCE!!!!! :)"}
{"text":"This is Louisiana cooking?  This is NOT recommended to any family who is health conscious, as you could probably say about 99% of the fast food out there.  However, of those out there, this ranks in the bottom 20% for nutrition.  Please don't take an elderly person here, they my have a heart attack right there at the pick-up counter.  My experience at the picki-up window was an odyssey of floundering, in a hot hot kitchen, run by overlords.  You could not pay me to eat here again, do not even try, but if you do, do so at your own risk."}
{"text":"No star because they tried to put a small wing drumstick shaped in replacement for a full size drumstick.  We purchased the 2 legs and a biscuit meal.  They gave us 1 leg , a small chicken wing shaped like a small leg and no biscuit. Paid 4.31.  We returned it got our money back.  I talk to manager about what they were trying to pull she just acted like oh I will talk to them.  Bad service and bad food. Cost to much. Yelp is making me put a star bit they do not deserve any stars."}
{"text":"This popeyes location is located in the middle of no where. If you didn't know you were looking for it, you would missing it for sure.The service is usually pretty quick and they seem to making the chicken fresh, so far I haven't had a dry piece yet. Even though its out of my way, I would drive to this location because its better quality."}
{"text":"Yes 5 stars for a fast food fried chicken joint. Why?

DISCLAIMER: not all branches of Popeyes are created equal. If you have not been impressed with the quality at other branches then try out this location before you discount Popeyes completely.

Fresh, flavorful, hot out of the fryer crispy tender chicken AND lightening fast service AND open late every day of the week. We were there one hour before closing on a Wednesday and it was packed. Good thing the majority of people were ordering theirs to go. After we placed our order and I sat down at a table and got comfortable, our order was ready! Another thing that makes this branch stand out from the others is that they have menu items that are not available at other stores (see pic). If they use the same gravy for the poutine that they use in their mashed potatoes, I know what my favorite side is gonna be!"}
{"text":"I have not had any bad experience from this place indeed I've seen the manager or the owner said some really sexist thing to my boyfriend but that doesn't change the quality of their fried chicken comparing to other franchise locations. 
Everytime I order fried chicken they're fresh, hot and crispy, and large! Their mash potatoes are never too watery but sometimes a little dry. Today i had the sandwich special, as good as usual, crispy chicken and everything was in proportion."}
{"text":"Hands down better than KFC! lol...not because its close to my house, but its a lot less grease, better grade of batter used, and the quality is up to my standards!  Though fried chicken isn't a cuisine, or anything special, they have a lot of promotions and sides to include with your meals...... we ordered their family special which included their ALWAYS-DELICIOUS biscuits! mmmm ..."}
{"text":"BE CAUTIOUS... My husband and I took our kids to eat here yesterday and the girl at the register charged my husband's card twice!!!! She said it didn't go through the first time. So my husband had to take my son to the restroom and I grabbed our food. He asked if I got the receipt back on the tray I told him no. He checked our account and saw 2 pending charges of over $50 worth of food. He told the supervisor on duty if he could check how much they charged his card and he asked my husband for his receipt. My husband said he never received one... The girl at the register overheard their conversation and said oh yeah I did charge you twice but didn't see you afterwards...?! Wth?!!! Who charges someone twice and notices it but doesn't even check if they are eating at a table?! Dumb girl!!!! We will never eat there again!!!! Check your account if you eat here bc you might get charged more than once!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Popeyes but this meal was not the greatest. The chicken had a frozen or refried taste, generally not fresh tasting. Maybe the oil was old. I don't know but it wasn't the best. 

The sweet tea was also extremely watery. I'm sure this is a one off, but if I'm reviewing based on my experience (which is of course how you do it) it could have been much better."}
{"text":"One of Brampton's first Popeye's locations. The food is good but I've had to wait now and again even when the restaurant wasn't very busy. The food has always been good leaving me nothing to complain about although criticisms of the service aren't beyond believing."}
{"text":"I'll never understand \"fast\" food restaurants that don't have enough food prepared at a rush time like dinner time. Why as a customer should I have to wait 15 minutes or accept alternates like smaller pieces or spicy when I want mild unless being encouraged to do so by way of a discount. 

Managers should have a better handle of the flow and be ready. Rant over. Going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Good, thoughtful, and polite service. Fresh and delicious chicken even late at night near closing time. They were out of gravy for the mashed but that's not terrible."}
{"text":"A fairly average Popeye's experience. Food was fresh and prepared quickly. Service was quick and friendly. The bathroom was a touch dirty but not disgusting."}
{"text":"Horrible! When 3 chicken strips fit in the palm of your hand, they are nuggets! My $25 meal was so not worth it. This was my first Popeyes experience and will be my last. I took pictures so I hope this review will let me post them. I also wrote to their corporate headquarters because this is seriously a complete rip off."}
{"text":"It felt like I waited far too long at 4 in the afternoon to have my order taken and get my food. About 15 minutes, most just to make the order. The food was fresh though although not as flavorful as I've had with other Popeye's locations. I won't be in a rush to return to this location."}
{"text":"It's Popeyes.....and I didn't get rude service, the daily special was nice...today was 3 pieces of chicken for 4.99, and you know what?  It was fresh and crispy and still tastes way better then KFC.   

I prefer spicy recipe but that's up to you.   If you don't mind the calories....their biscuits are quite addictive.  :-)  

It would be a dangerous thing if there was a Popeyes close to my house, I would be eating a lot more fried chicken.  I'm kind of glad there isn't one anywhere near me.  :-P"}
{"text":"Just left the establishment right now and I'm very upset. As my family and I were getting ready to leave, my nephew started to vomit on the floor. My husband and father told the cashier about the mess which I was already starting to clean up & one of the employees went to check out the mess and as I'm starting to apologize she makes the ugliest face and mutters something in Spanish as she's walking away. Well I'm sorry, lady, SH*T happens and if you don't like your job then find something else to do. I'm disgusted with her reaction in front of my nephews & daughter and lack of compassion she has towards kids."}
{"text":"Chicken  was delicious,  unfortunately service was horrible. We got delivery, the driver forgot our Gravy and part of our order. We called the store to inform them. We're told the driver would be right back. Took over an hour for the driver to return. Making the Gravy not needed unless we waited for the chicken to cool. We had order the 8 piece chicken family meal.  For you know familys. They we kind enough to provide one set of utensils.  Will likely not get delivery in the future. Will stick to take out."}
{"text":"First time eating here and I am sad to say I am disappointed. Not because of the quality of the food but because I paid for two mac and cheeses and did not receive them. Yes, I should have checked the bag before I drove off that was part my fault but my first impression of this place isn't good."}
{"text":"They don't even let your order a drink size, you just get the big ass cup. That's how they roll here at Popeye's. On a busy Saturday night shortly after the grand opening, this team is slaying it. Everything was perfect. Order your chicken hot, don't be a foo! Also save yourself some time and just order a whole box of extra biscuits."}
{"text":"What can I say, I love some Popeyes! I've had some problems going through the drive thru here, always seems to be backed up real bad. I've also dined in here on many occasions. The biscuits are laden in some kind of fake butter that is better than the memories of the first kiss you ever had. Be careful ordering the spicy but make sure you get extra biscuits. I prefer the newer North Olmsted location now."}
{"text":"Ahh kiki was my savior! She had good customer service and was hella efficient! I appreciate her attention to detail! I'd come here only because of her!!! Good job girl! You saved them!!!"}
{"text":"They weren't busy at all and in such a rush. My pivot was broken and half made. They did smile tho :) ... if they did care just a little it would make me want to come back. I ordered to go so I am not coming back but I am pretty frustrated."}
{"text":"I own stock in PLKI and wanted to check out this location.

As I walked up to the front door one of the employees on duty was outside the front door texting on her phone.  I though that was a little strange.

I ordered the 3 piece combo.  The chicken was pretty good if maybe slightly greasy.  The biscuit and green beans were OK as well.

As I was leaving the same employee was back outside the front door talking on the phone to a friend.  She was talking fairly loud and I could hear her clearly.  Believe it or not, she dropped the \"N\" word very loudly during the conversation.  I was appalled.

In reading the other reviews it's obvious that there is a serious management problem at this store."}
{"text":"I just went through the drive thru at this location. I got 3 big boxes.. I get home to see that I am missing 3 sides of fries, a biscuit and all my sauces.. I usually like Popeyes but that's ridiculous that I am missing that many items. Missing one is understandable, 2 a little irritated but it's fine but 5 things?? Very dissatisfied with this visit."}
{"text":"I like this place, the chicken tenders and fries are delicious! I have never gone in, only through the drive through and so far they have not forgotten anything like the other fast food joints around here.. I will go back!"}
{"text":"We showed up and ordered a total of 54 pieces of chicken and all the sides.  Service was very quick and friendly.  All food was perfect.  Great Popeyes location.  Wish there were more Popeyes in the valley."}
{"text":"Appalling wait times, absolutely no idea what takes them so long but a half hour wait is not unusual. Monumentally slow."}
{"text":"They are probably short staffed which causes them to be real slow. That's understandable. What sucks is when they tell you to wait 4 minutes that turn into 15. Whatever. 
What really, REALLY sucks, is when they short change you. I told the guy who brought our drive thru order to our car (after waiting), that the cashier didn't give me my change. He returned and said that \"she said she gave everyone their change.\" I didn't even have a receipt and I felt bad for this guy who was walking to every car giving the orders, and definitely didn't feel like waiting more time there. 
I'll take the full blame for this one; I shouldn't have driven away from the window without making sure I had my change. Hopefully, the register is up $5.02 and they can feel bad about it after (for like 5 secs) for not giving me my change. But - if the cashier pocketed it, I hope the $5.02 takes you far in life.

P.S. They didn't give me sauce for my tenders either!! Wait, maybe because they didn't give me the tenders I ordered (#5) they gave me the 3 piece! Now this is why you get one star..."}
{"text":"FIRST time trying popeye's chicken ! Chicken was good, i order a side of cole slaw. IT was disgusting and served HOT !( if i have to say so myself.. i believe that's is against HEALTH code !) No,one wants hot cole slaw on a hot day !"}
{"text":"Please do not go here. Food is unsanitary as they serve nor even warm, but cold/old chicken. I worked at popeyes before and they are supposed to discard chicken that are not to standards anymore but they still serve the food. I have given them far too many chances but every single time they still do it. Love popeyes but this place is def on my not to go list. Customer service is yet another horror story!"}
{"text":"I love it how you order 8 biscuits and and you ask for extra honey....so we get 3 total honey packets. Seriously?

We decided to go here pretty late because we had family over and forgot to eat and this location was one of the few places open that we haven't eaten in awhile.  So we go through drive thru and get the 16 piece chicken meal with 8 biscuits.  I specifically asked for more honey because I know how these fast food restaurants skimp on the condiments.  So the cashier asked us to pull foward and she'd bring the meal to us.  My Spidey senses began to tingle a little bit  but it wasn't too alarming.  I'm always skeptical when they ask you to pull foward when there are no cars behind you.  Im like ok Ill pull foward because of the potential customers that are not coming so you can keep a clear lane.  

Honeslty I should have checked but the cashier had a reassuring answer for us like she was gonna load us up on honey like it was a bank robbery.  Not the case!  Get home and we got all this delicious chicken and all these biscuits and basically no honey.  Bee's work overtime to provide the masses with their honey.  I tried to eat a biscuit after the honey was gone and the dry biscuit sucked all the moisture out of my mouth.  Immediate cotton mouth was the diagnosis.  Trust your tingles and check your order before you leave is the moral of the review."}
{"text":"I never wrote a review because i was super mad at the time.. but 2 years ago, i got food poisoning here. I normally ordered regular crispy chicken. I decided to get spicy breaded to change it up. The skin near the bone had a pink tint, but to be honest, i thought it was hot sauce or marinade so i thought nothing of it. They fed me under cooked chicken! I was sick for 2 days--- which may not seem like alot, but when you have food poisoning, 48 hours of constantly being nauseous and vomiting is hell. 

The worst part is how it was handled. I called the manager later to inform him of this and to avoid it happening to someone else. They told me it was \"impossible\" to be given undercooked chicken. I was appalled. I emailed corporate and had no response. Terrible.

I used to LOVEEEE Popeyes, now sadly the smell of it makes me nauseous and reminds me of the time i was deathly sick.. i literally hold me nose going into the south side giant eagle bc the smell of the popeyes next to it makes me sick. so sad. :\ I miss the red beans and rice but i cant handle the smell. dont trust their food."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Part of my opinion is due to the small portion sizes.

I must admit, I've been a little disappointed with Popeyes lately. I just went again and have finally confirmed:

Their chicken tastes way too floury (I do not order tenders, so can't speak for those). When I think Cajun I expect a burst of flavor...

Granted this is budget friendly food, but still, if you are going to claim Cajun as your fame, I think there should be more flavor.

Their mac n cheese is generic, HOWEVER..

Their rice and beans is to die for!!! BUT, you do not get a lot, very disappointing.

I doubt I will ever want Popeye's again over other options, but would go again - expecting to overpay for a small amount of subpar food.

POPEYES HAS LEFT THE DOOR OPEN FOR LEGITIMATE CHICKEN SHACKS TO BEAT THEM OUT EVERY TIME!!! 

In my opinion, there is even room for another cajun chicken fast food chain, Popeyes is not doing it right"}
{"text":"exsperiance was bad i wait for what seemed like a half hour i would never go back popeyes is gross food i would stay away from there"}
{"text":"Worst of the worst customer service ever to the guy that takes order at the drive thru window!!! I'm not there to get that special 2 for $1.69 I was there to order from the menu and if you can't understand that KICK ROCKS YOU OLD HAG!!"}
{"text":"I was craving fried chicken after I saw one of their commercials last Saturday night and decided why not! I haven't had their chicken since I was probably around 12 years old or so and my boyfriend kept telling me he loved their chicken as well, so we drove over there. I got a little meal deal with a drink, drove through the drive thru. My boyfriend, who was driving was handed my sprite, but the cup was covered in sprite, so he asked the guy if he could wipe it off so the drink holder in the new truck doesn't get all sticky and dirty. He gave us attitude and snatched the soda from my boyfriends hand then handed it back to us(we said thank you, eventhough he was being rude), along with my meal box. I opened up the box with excitement to eat their Cajun fries! I was super disappointed, not only were the fries COLD they were old and stale like... so I went to take a bite of my chicken instead,  but before I did I poked all of them and they were all COLD besides one drum...WTF!? Hasn't this place heard of a heating lamp, or making food fresh or some sort of food rotation?! So with that being said I was super disappointed, and had to heat up my food in the toaster oven when I got home and threw out the fries,  what a waste of time and my money..."}
{"text":"Most ridiculous place ever. They always manage to ruin your dinner 100 different ways...EVERYTIME. If it's not forgetting your sauce, it's no napkins or utensils. Not having spicy or mild, no tenders available....I mean is it not enough that your employees customer service level is at a 2, but now you \"refry\" the chicken to heat it up...I give up. I won't come anymore. I actually liked it the 2 times you got my order correct."}
{"text":"I always hated the service here; especially one of the lady manager in the green shirt, she hated her job and she always yells at her employees in front of us. She is extremely rude in the drive through, we asked for a bag for our box of chicken, she gives us attitude and gave our chicken bag upside down. And the employees needs a lot more training in customer service; they are rude they either don't give me the correct order and gives me attitude when I asks for a bag or anything, it's like they have zero to no training.


-beside that we were greeting my a man named \"rhymth\" yesterday and he said that he was a Popeyes embassador, he the best part about this place -beside for the food; the food is always good..."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. First, the cashier guy was so rude and impatient. I've never experienced customer service this bad. In addition, we came home with the order ALL wrong. EVERYTHING was mixed up.  I was given blackened chicken when I asked for mild. I cannot stand the blackened chicken so dinner for me was pretty much ruined. Not to mention the wrong sauce was given. Also, the cashier was the one serving the food!!! He went STRAIGHT from the cash register, handling dirty cash, to getting the food from behind, NO HAND WASHING, NO GLOVES.  Gross!  I'm pretty sure that's a HUGE health violation. Also, no butter and no honey was included with the biscuits. Don't go to this one. Don't let them ruin your meal too. It's not worth the aggravation and absolutely 100% not worth the money.  Wish I could've gotten the cashier's name, but he wasn't wearing a name tag. Go figure."}
{"text":"I'm originally from the south. Popeye's is one of my favorite fast food restaurants. Imagine my delight to see that they put a new location in this area. I've been to this new location 3 times so far. We have only used the drive thru. The service is polite. The wait times are normal for a Popeye's (maybe even a little faster). The food has been hot and fresh each time with the exception of some french fries that were lukewarm. Most recently we ordered the $20 box of chicken with 2 large sides and 5 biscuits. It was delicious and a good value. My only complaint is that the large mash potatoes had about 2 tablespoons of gravy. 

This location is a welcome addition. They will hopefully be more consistent with corporate standards as time goes on. For a new location they're doing surprising well."}
{"text":"I work across the street and was super excited for this place to open, totally thought the bad reviews couldn't be right. Well I was definitely wrong!

I ordered the Number 11 which is Fish and shrimp, 1 side and 1 biscuit. Not hard? I also asked for their ranch sauce. The lady in the drive thru window was so into talking to her co workers she completely tuned me out. She gave me my food I asked her about the sauce she said yeah it's in there. So i said ok and when I got home, I had a box full of shrimp, NO fish AND NO biscuit. I might also add NO sauce. I can't even begin to say how upset I was, but seriously how do these people still have their jobs at this point?! Do not go here, waste of money and time."}
{"text":"This location isn't closed. I've ate at Popeyes plenty of times but this location was by far the worst. It was during the peak lunch rush and all together probably waited 15-20 minutes for my food. When people that ordered after me we're getting their food before me I asked one of the girls and instead of caring she just told me that the food wasn't ready. My order was incorrect when all I got was simply 3 tenders and green beans.  I was pissed off and just took the food and left. 

You can tell the employees hate working there.

Probably won't come back to this location again.      :("}
{"text":"Cuz I ain't no hater or nothin but this shit straight trash. Idk who they got back there cooking this unseasoned ass chicken but they need to be fired. My taste buds are mad at me for even putting that shit in my mouth. This chicken make a nigga wanna go vegan smh I wish I can give em negative stars"}
{"text":"Worst location ever! I ordered quite a large order from here for my partner's birthday. They took over two hours to deliver and we were supposed to surprise him!! 

We endlessly called after an hour and NOBODY picked up the phone and the voicemail was a cell phone because it said, \"we're sorry, but the wireless customer is unavailable right now...\". It was so frustrating. 

Then we ended up calling the location at Dufferin and Bloor and told them our issue and they said they have over taken orders from the Popeyes at St. Claire more times than they could count. We ordered again from them and our original order eventually showed up. I complained to the driver and I felt bad after because it seemed as though he has suffered from these complaints before and immediately gave me a discount. 

I then had to call the other Popeye's location and cancel the order. They were so super chill and said no problem and suggested we call them from now on. Which we will do. 

Who the heck takes over 2 hours to deliver food which is legit a five minute drive away. 

So wrong!"}
{"text":"Best Popeyes! Food is served super hot (heat not spice) fresh and juicy. Brand new location the interior is clean and inviting the service is quick. And quality is what you would expect. Enough said, if you want fried chicken look no further."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service not so much. I've been there a few times and the past two occasions I've found the people who take your order to be rude and unfriendly. In one instance they forgot to give me half my order and when I went back for it, the girl very rudely threw the bag in my hands without an apology or any acknowledgement of the error. The second time, another girl rolled her eyes at me when I changed my order. Very poor customer service. I gave it a 3 only because the food was good."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times the food was very good (fresh and fast)!! Also it's very clean inside and out!! My only concern is an employee (Kenya) who is a very rude, unkind and impatient employee!! She never waited on me but her interactions with other customers is garbage!  I've worked in fast food and I can say it's not that bad!! This place can get 5 stars if they get rid of that person!! That's not good for business!! If she doesn't want to work there then fire her and hire a more friendly person!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here tonight but did the drive thru. This was my first time eating Popeye's. I ordered the chicken po boy combo and my husband got the 4 piece chicken combo. When we got home to eat, I noticed that my chicken was really dry and not very fresh. The coleslaw was OK and my husbands meal was fresher than mine but 2 of his pieces of chicken were tiny!! 

If the chicken was fresh, I think this would taste a lot better."}
{"text":"Had an issue with my order, night manager Frank got it taken care of in a fast and professional manner. Thanks Frank"}
{"text":"It would be good if they had chicken. Ten minute wait for chicken or tenders. Who has that time? Not the first time either."}
{"text":"This Popeyes hires the most incompetent workers avalible. Had to correct my order 3 times (once after ordering Twice at the window) and they Still gave me the wrong kind of chicken tenders (mild instead of Spicey) and forgot one of my sides. They're stingy af with their sauce like it comes out of their paycheck. When they first opened they were great and I never had any issues but they've really gone down hill since then."}
{"text":"I love Popeyes chicken so I was very unhappy to get home with my order of cold and greasy chicken. I only leave 4 minutes away which means that my chicken should still have been fairly fresh when I arrive. I opened that box to see the crust falling off the chicken and very greasy as if it had been dumped in oil twice. I wanted to go back that same day to complain but my kids were hungry and frankly I did not feel like it. Next time I will drive to Santan location if I am craving Popeyes."}
{"text":"I ordered the #11 combo (popcorn shrimp), and 2 kids meals. The cashier charged me for the chicken tender combo. When I got my order,  I told her I ordered the popcorn shrimp, she took out the receipt and said I ordered the chicken tender combo. I said, no, I ordered the #11 which is the popcorn shrimp, the cashier kept pointing at then receipt stating that I ordered the chicken tenders... then annoyed, she said I'll change it for you and gave me the popcorn shrimp as if she was giving in. The food is not good and the service is horrible. 2 stars because my daughter liked her chicken leg kids meal."}
{"text":"Fresh, hot chicken. Sides are no different than the others but here, never dried out or stale. I drive by two other Popeye's to get here. Good service. 
If only I could buy their hot sauce in a small bottle."}
{"text":"Stopped in via the drive thru around 10pm on a weeknight.  Service was prompt considering that they relayed that they were cooking my tenders.  Unfortunately, the guy boxing my food couldn't count and gave me a less than my order AND most annoying was that one of them was tiny!  I addressed the (very young late teens/barely 21 yr old) manager, who immediately retrieved more tenders... added several more to make up for their error and apologized.  Who then can complain :o)"}
{"text":"This is the worst Popeye ever ppl that work here are slow always under staff never have chicken ready"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Popeyes Chicken and it was very good. Lots of choices and the employees were very friendly, had a 3 piece combo with fries and their fantastic melt in your mouth biscuits!! (Probably the best just after Red Lobster) My wife had chicken fingers and we both left full. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Yeah I know fried foods aint good for you yeah I know those buttery biscuits and all those carbs aren't good for you either but when you bite into some Popeyes fried chicken and eat those biscuits and that red beans and rice will most definitely smack your mama and don't ever forget the $0.99 Tuesday special I love me some Popeyes and there's not a leaf of spinach insight.....  The 99 cent special on Tuesdays is two pieces of chicken and a biscuit"}
{"text":"Second time I've been told we don't have any chicken. What you serving then ? Sides and fries?  Stupid lazy ass fools be workin here . You're job is to cook chicken then cook chicken.  Don't like it get a different job plenty other people out there willing to do it."}
{"text":"I love how at Popeye's you have to wait for your meal...that means it isn't pre cooked just sitting at the back being warmed up.  It's being fried right there.

I usually get the same - 3 tenders and the cajun fries.  After I ordered I did see the special for the ghost pepper wings and wanted to try that but my order was already being cooked, but next time I will try that and see how it tastes.

I love the spicy tenders - not my mouth is on fire and I can't taste anything else hot..but just a nice tingle.  The cajun fries are nice with the hint of spice, plus they are the thin fries...I love those kind over those chunky ass fries (yeah I know they taste the same but still...this is for me where size matters!)

The staff are always friendly and I love have they have a variety of different sides - something different from the typical fried chicken places."}
{"text":"I love me some Popeyes Chicken, and tonight was the night that my husband wanted them so I quickly obliged.

Service was terrible, however.  I wasn't greeted or acknowledged to place my order.  I have to make eye contact and asked if the cashier was ready for me.  After I placed my order, I realized there was a current deal that the cashier didn't bother to share.  C'mon now, the deal on the side board changes frequently so how the heck am I to see it right away?  

Anyways, thought that was the end of the bad service...NOPE.  The  person that put together my order was cold and stingy.  I have to ask for every bit of sauces and condiments for my order.  She didn't look happy at all handing me the sauces.

The chicken tasted good as usual, but I hope these not so happy employee find another job that they will be happy doing...cuz this aint it for them."}
{"text":"Maybe it was a fluke but we had a big order and everything came out perfect. The girl behind the counter was helpful in assisting us to decide on what to get. The chickens delicious. Best fast food fried chicken around. A tad expensive but then again we were feeding nine people. We had enough and a little left over. Id definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"There's nothing negative to say about this establishment. It's fried chicken that's crispy, spicy and incredibly flavorful. The biscuits are buttery soft and always served piping hot. The contrast of the coleslaw with the incredibly moist chicken is phenomenal. The fries have a nice kick to it, but I will admit it's the weakest part of the meal for me. I do enjoy the corn on the cob and it's my boyfriend's favorite side. I've honestly never had a bad meal from them. I can order in person and it's fresh and piping hot, I can order from skip the dishes and it's still delivered fresh and piping hot. Their food quality is consistently good and you can tell that they take pride in what they serve you. 
I will admit that sometimes the oil level is a bit much... but that's very rare."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken tenders 45 minutes before close, they said 6-7 minutes, it was busy, so 20 minutes later im like WTF, then she asked the cook, and he says, I'm dropping them NOW, are you kidding me?, bloody muslims are all retards, not sure why so many of them work and go to popeyes, but if you like super heartburn and idiots serving you, then go here, if not then don't, I don't, anymore"}
{"text":"This just opened on a Queen East a short while ago.  I like to think they are still working through some kinks.  The food took a while considering it's fast food, but they made it when I ordered, so it was really hot and as fresh as fast food gets.  I used to go to one in Vaughan, this location was much better.  It's very clean, and there's a fair amount of seating.  If you're in the mood for fried chicken and you are in the area, this is probably a good place to stop."}
{"text":"Don't go here!
I got ripped off!

I ordered a family meal and the man at the counter said it came with 10 fingers, but when I got home, there were only 8!  And then he asked me which 3 sauces I wanted, and when I got home there were only 2!  To top it all off, it was $4 more than buying 2 individual meals that would have included all the same things, plus my 2 missing chicken fingers and 2 drinks!

They didn't provide me with the items I ordered, and I don't want that to happen to you.
I strongly advise avoiding this place."}
{"text":"I normally never have an issue when I come to this location & I love the food. However tonight I'm extremely disappointed with the lack of customer service I received for the inconvenience & time wasted that occurred as a result of the restaurant messing up my order. The employee who took the order, go it correct. The employees who packed it didn't. When I realized my order was incorrect, I called the restaurant, but didn't get an answer. When I came back to get my order fixed, I was told I could keep the sides. I asked for fresh chicken because of the time lapse (order taken at 9:06pm, left restaurant after coming back at 9:44pm). I was told that I couldn't get fresh chicken because they were closing & that if I wanted to get a replacement meal I would have to come back on Friday. The lack of customer service extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"Just got back home from this place.  I was extremely disappointed in my visit.  This place was definitely way under staffed.  We waited forever to get our meals.  There was always a line while we were waiting to order, waiting and waiting for our meals to come, and also while we were eating, the line continued.   The employees seemed to be stressed and with the amount of staff and customers ratio, I can fully see.  The dining room was not kept up.  I had to clean two of the tables that we were using.  All the unoccupied tables were messy and needed to be wiped sown as well as the condiments stand and drink fountain area.  I ordered a small drink and took the last lid.  The food was good.  However in all we had six meals that were ordered.  My friend asked for another sauce.  I did not get one.  They were going to charge her.  Now I don't know if this is a corporate thing or franchise."}
{"text":"I'm just going to say that the customer service I'm used to back south is totally different at any Popeyes I've been to in the valley and I expected too much on my first time here today around 2pm. 
I should have known better when I tried to go through the drive thru that I had to avoid someone hitting me because an employee was returning from break and his friend in his truck blocked the drive thru. Ok whatever. Get into the drive and speak with Dejuan I believe. Placed my order and everything seemed fine. I had to wait a few minutes because I order an 8 piece of ghost pepper wing and a number 10 shrimp box with Cajun rice. 
I was told to pull up and wait. I did. A young guy brought my food out and asked if I had the ghost pepper wings. I said yes. Exchange happened. Cool. 
Here's where it goes left without my knowledge. Ive driven home with my pets with me. So I'm not thinking to start rambling through the bag to see if my order is correct. Get home and open the bag and I have 2 3 piece spicy chicken strip boxes with Cajun fries and even the sauces are wrong too. So clearly they mistaken the orders because all the boxes look the same for promotion. That's trash. Now I'm given some doubt to marketing but more to the employees as they should double check as they bag. I get it. I've worked fast food but I'm also mad that I spent damn near $20 bucks and the only thing that came out right was my large ice tea. 
Y'all have to pay a little bit closer attention to detail."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the other reviews that the customer service here needs a tune up.

Been here three times and I've been a bit let down each time.

First time was the first Saturday they were open.  Order and get for food.  Go to wash my hands and the sink doesn't work.  Manager acknowledged that the sink wasn't working.  Did the manager offer to let me use the ladies room sink?  No.  How about the hand sink behind the counter?  No.  Had my lunch using napkins to hold the food.

New Year's Day 2018.....they open at 11.  I pull on the door at 11:02.  Still locked.  No big deal. A few moments later I see an employee cleaning the glass on the door I just attempted to open.  Pull the door - locked and she keeps washing the glass.

I try the side door a few moments later and it's open.  There's my friend now, cleaning the glass of the side door....does she open the door?  Greet me?  No.  Honestly, she's flat out grumpy.  Cmon just try a little more Popeyes."}
{"text":"rude employees, even the managers. shitty place. There's one weird guy always coming and asking for money, even if u politely telling them \"sorry, I don't have\" he won't go."}
{"text":"I think that with fast food places, most people don't leave reviews unless they have a bad experience, so I feel like it's my duty to report the great experience I had there!  I haven't been to a Popeye's since the 1980s when I was living in Atlanta, but I loved it there!  

The Good:  
*  From the drive-thru window, you can see most of the kitchen, and it's clean and well organized.  Even condiments and things like that are neatly arranged in bins for the employees.  
*  Food is excellent.  Everything tastes fresh and not greasy.  
*  I'm glad they now have chicken strips, and their strips are crisp and tasty, just as they should be.  I got the mild version, but if you like spice, they offer a spicy version as well.  
*  Green beans are awesome!  They are in a sauce that's almost like gravy, and I like that they use turkey bacon to flavor the green beans.  
*  Mashed potatoes are really good.  They are obviously real potatoes--not reconstituted (like KFC sells).  
*  The young lady at the window was very friendly and kind.  She handled my change and delivered the food promptly.  She's exactly who should be serving the public, and her supervisors should be proud of the great impression she leaves with customers.

The Not-So-Good:
*  The biscuits are a little too heavy, and they have an \"off\" taste like they used too much baking soda or baking powder.  Even so, they're not bad enough to make me throw them away!  They would probably be great if you use them to make chicken biscuits, though, because they won't fall apart as easily.  

This store knows how to make chicken and comfort food that's healthy and yummy, and we will be back!"}
{"text":"My partner seems to LOVE Popeye's.  I like it, but don't really get his near obsession with it.  Anyways, we've visited a few Popeye's in Toronto and I say this one is his favorite location.

The restaurant itself is very brightly lit.  The restaurant is accessible and the bathrooms are gendered.  This place is BARELY vegetarian friendly so vegans, avert your eyes.  

Everyone who I've interacted with at this restaurant seems to have the patience of a saint.  I've seen employees and managers deal with ALL sorts of non-sense and not only did they handle it well, they did so with a smile.  

I've never had an issue with this location providing cold food, inaccurate orders or forget condiments.  And the employees are super nice, so that's why I keep going back!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Popeyes!! They are so ghetto and rude. I seriously will not go there. I'll go the extra 10 minutes to Macedonia. I had a really bad experience recently--horrible customer service. They were talking, not knowing that the drive thru microphone was on, and swearing and talking about horrible things to do to the customers food. I pulled out of line so fast. Seriously. I want the owner of this franchise to turn this around!!! We have been going to Popeyes for years... it's just so sad to see what's happened. I wish they would hire some people that actually cared. We will not be eating at Popeyes for a while...but oh my gosh, stay away from this one, for sure."}
{"text":"This location is ridiculous.  They leave out the biscuits every time, even when you ask if they have included them.  This visit they shorted us chicken & biscuits.  This location is close to home but we won't be going again.  The drive through is consistently slow & the line is long.  The least they could do is make sure the order is right."}
{"text":"First of all the manger there Travis is awesome he greeted us when we came in, we've been there about 4 times and we never had a problem with anything, the employees where very friendly. The place is clean and l saw Travis working along with his crew. I will definitely be back there again l Love the crispy chicken  And the cleanliness of this Popeyes"}
{"text":"Been waiting for 50 plus minutes...... this better be good. This place is struggling bad bad bad. Still haven't received food it's now 55+ minutes."}
{"text":"Now I have been to many Popeyes in my lifetime.  I do not order dark meat ever.  There is ALWAYS white meat in every location I have been to.    Now every time I go to THIS specific popeyes they never seem to have white meat.  There is 8 parts to a chicken.  4 pieces of them are dark meat the other 4 pieces is white.  I am not Stephen Hawkings but that is 50% of your chicken that you sell.  For some reason this Popeyes NEVER EVER has white meat.  I see under their heat lamps at least 50 pieces of chicken and you  are telling me that not one is white???  This is racism towards the white meat lovers.  I have a feeling the owners of this place keep the white meat for themselves and feed their community with it.  
White meat matters!"}
{"text":"Knew of Popeye's from living in Florida, were it was always very yummy.  Here, not so great.  The service was very nice and helpful, even though they did mix up my order slightly and I did go inside.  The chicken tenders were bland and over cooked.  The rice and beans, didn't taste like much.  The biscuits were dry.  Not sure if I will go again??"}
{"text":"Bathroom in this place is disgusting. I went at 6 pm and they appeared to have not been cleaned for the day nor was there any toilet paper. Why would you ever buy food with a place with such a disgusting bathroom!!"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait for this location to open up near me and boy was this a let down.  Too many kids working there and bouncing around like a playgound.  The cashier couldn't even hear me because of the chaos and noise, and  I was inside standing at the register. I felt like it was an airport restaurant.  No specials and cost me a fortune.  If the food had not been ICE COLD I probably would have given them another chance before reviewing.  I just took the loss and will drive to the other locations from now on.  Very dissapointing."}
{"text":"Waited in the drive thru for over 40 minutes. Meal wasn't even put in (per the receipt) until almost 20 minutes after I ordered. So after 40 minutes and no food I ask for a refund. The manager Jaronda didn't care at all how long I had been waiting and didn't even offer me as much as an apology for the wait. This location needs to be closed down permanently. Brooklyn was my cashier. This visit was 11.13.16"}
{"text":"I love Popeyes chicken, so I was excited when the Monroeville location reopened.  I've gotten food here several times and every time the food was good but the service was exceptionally bad.  I've had the wrong items in my order, items missing from my order, been charged incorrectly for items and perhaps the worst, there is ALWAYS a wait.

During my most recent visit, there was a special advertised for $5.99 so I ordered that.  When I got to the window, my order total was around $8.  When I asked the cashier what the issue was, she said \"oh, you wanted the special?\"  When in fact I had ordered the special.  No thanks, I'd prefer to pay $2 more for the exact same meal.  I ordered spicey chicken which was also an apparent issue.  At first I was told it would be another 5-7 minutes for spicey.  I said that was fine and they said they would be right back.  Then they came back and asked what I had ordered.  She said they were out of spicey.  I said you told me a 5-7 minute wait and that was fine.  A few minutes later she came back with my order saying they had spicey all along.  When I pulled away, I realized that they had not given me a fork.  Thankfully I had one or I wouldn't have been able to eat my meal.

Overall, the chicken is good and I enjoy their sides (especially the rice and beans) but when you go, expect delays and poor service."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars.  The chicken was mediocre, the dark meat tasted like white meat.  I order dark meat for a reason, so it doesn't taste like dry white meat.  

This already being disappointing, I open my mashed potatoes with \"gravy\"... What is this?  There's almost no gravy!  We ask for more, saying there's hardly any.  A female manager, short with dark hair, responds without seeming to care at all and in a really rude and dismissing tone that an SMALL cup of extra gravy is $1.99 and they only put a small scoop into their mashed potatoes... 

I'm sorry, $2 for gravy when my potatoes were supposed to already have it?  That small scoop wasn't much of anything, it looked like they spit some gravy into my potatoes.  

I tried to make up for the lack of gravy by using a biscuit to eat it with, but that was worse than on its own.  The biscuit was dry and flavorless.  

I will never come back to this disgusting place again, especially with disrespectful, disinterested employees."}

{"text":"The crew and I decided to go and grab a few pieces of that yard bird and when in the market for yard bird, where else would you go? So we  stepped into the Louisiana kitchen where there were biscuits being buttered, wings being waved and sugar being dumped relentlessly into now bags (convenient but different). We had a coupon so the price was more than fair. The gentlemen at the register was very helpful and polite. The food came out quickly and there wasn't anything we asked for that they didn't answer with \"no problem, got you covered\". The atmosphere was light we were one of two families dining in. Unlike the chicken breast the music was terrible, but we had more than one person come and check on us to make sure we had everything we needed. It was pretty cool all and all we enjoyed both the meal and dining out in a peaceful environment. We'd give it another go."}
{"text":"Was greeted upon entering. I always order a 12-piece spicy family meal with red beans & rice and mashed potatos. Didn't have butter or hot sauce. The chicken was hot and juicy. The rice in my red beans was undercooked so luckily I was able to finish cooking it in hotel microwave. The staff was friendly. Plenty of parking in shared lot."}
{"text":"I've been here maybe three times. 2/3 times I've received the completely wrong order. Made a complaint online for the first time (never heard back). Went back in the second time with my order and receipt, had to point out everything that was wrong because apparently they couldn't tell by looking at it compared to my receipt. No refund, coupons, or anything offered for my time wasted. Will not go back here and warn everyone that unless they want to spend their entire lunch break dealing with them, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Popeye's always has those nice looking commercials that lure you in.  I like Cajun food.  It looks like you will have a good meal.  First of all, they often don't have the special items they advertise.  Don't ask me why.  Also, they are notoriously SLOW in getting the food cooked and ready to go.  Don't let the commercials lure you in."}
{"text":"By far the worst service ive had in any drive thru ever. Worker was not responsive when i was trying to order food, bearly repeated anything i said back. It was like i was talking to a wall. Actually wait, i was practically talking to a wall. Got to the window and got my food and took only a few seconds to double check if she got everything right on my order due to her not repeating the order back and noticed i had no ranch dressing(was specified when ordering through the window). The lady peeked back out of the window and said, \"excuse me, but your taking up my drive thru time!\". I told her she forgot my ranch that I specifically said on my order multiple times and that if shes trying to rush me, at least get my order right. Look i know this might sound like a obnoxious post but ive worked for a drive thru for many many years and ive been to a few bad drive thrus but i stand my ground when i say this is the worst one. I have never felt so disrespected at a drive thru ever. I also was trying to settle my differences with this location by calling their location to talk to a manager to see if theres any way they could fix the bad service that they have provided but they werent picking up the phone and after the 4th call, it seemed as if they disconnected their line like they knew they messed up and didn't want to confront their problems like a reasonable person. I understand this is not a 5 star resturant or anything but theres no need to treat people lowly. A one star on this resturant is a little too much for the people who served there and deserve much less. Didnt even get to eat the food when i got home due to how upset i truly was. Thank you for taking the time to read this review, it has been a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Had food delivered to the office earlier today.     They forgot one of the side orders.   Food was as expected otherwise.   Get us everything we order next time and you'll get a better rating!"}
{"text":"I love Popeye's. I can't help it. I like fried chicken and this is good fried chicken. Sometimes tables aren't clean immediately during busy times but other than that, I like this branch. Customer service is always good. The parking lot is just a bit busy at times and it's at the corner of Decatur and Sunset, so it's a pain to turn into, but overall it's a good place to get good fried chicken."}
{"text":"This place is terrible, this is the second time I've come here to order chicken and they are out of chicken.... what!? The girl at the drive through was rude and offered no solution. Don't waste your time going there."}
{"text":"Popeye's has great chicken tenders. I come here for weekday lunch and the tenders are, crispy, hot and juicy.  

I love the mashed potatoes and gravy, neither taste like they were squeezed out of a bag (cough cough KFC).  The biscuits are awesome too.

My most recent trip I tried the blackened tenders which are not fried or battered, but seasoned chicken tenders. They were tasty and slightly more healthy.

I also looked around and there was probably 20 other people there all eating tenders... a good sign.

Come for a great chicken tender meal, especially on weekdays during lunch."}
{"text":"NEVER going to this Popeyes again! Went a few days ago  only to open my box and see green spots on my chicken. Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Great customer service (polite and courteous) and delicious meal for an awesome price. On their website, they have coupons. Today I printed out a coupon to get a free 2 piece dinner with purchase of a 3 piece dinner. That was 2 combos for just over $7, including one drink. At the window, I ordered a 3 pc white meat meal w/ Cajun rice and a 2 pc white meat meal w/ mashed potatoes & gravy. I wanted spicy for both meals, but the attendant said after my 3 pc spicy, the only white meat left was in mild, so I went with the 2 pc mild and figured I'd mix and match the meals myself. I am so happy I got to try the mild (I always order spicy stuff). TBH, I think the mild was much more flavorful, moist, HOT and deliciously fresh. This is my 3rd time visiting this location since they opened at the end of last year. My first experience was 2-3 star (chicken seemed bland, but perhaps it was opening night jitters), 2nd experience was a solid 3 star (tried the shrimp instead of chicken) and today was 4 stars for sure. They even remembered to ask me if I wanted any sauces/honey/butter (awesome because I always forget to ask). Couldn't dole out 5 stars because the Cajun rice could use some more oomph."}
{"text":"So clean!
FAST!
 Beautifully decorated!
Polite and Professional staff!

And the food...what can I say..love me some POPEYES"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst airport food ever.. Grabbed a quick breakfast while waiting to board our flight .. I had the sausage biscuit and it was beyond dry.. There wasn't enough ketchup on hand to give this thing they call food any flavor , and for what they charge vs a regular Popeyes its disturbing . What a waste of money, as for the customer service, the cashier was just plain rude with absolutely ZERO customer service skills, I walked up to her said \"good morning \" and she totally blew me off and just said , \"what do you want to order?\" No response as to my greeting, the gal that handed the food to us was a lot friendlier and even said \" have a great day\" if one is so miserable about the their job, then quit and go somewhere else.. Preferably where you don't deal with the public. Granted airport food courts aren't the best but for what they charge, they should try to improve the quality of food they serve and have better customer service !! IMO.."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I got $0.99 problems but the Tuesday deal from Popeyes ain't one. 99 cents for two pieces of chicken hits the spot once in a while and Popeyes always come through. I don't come here often but it's hard not to take advantage of this deal. I always add some biscuits, they are delicious. Their chicken seems to be consistent  and  service is average for a drive thru place."}
{"text":"This location used to be really good. I don't work far from here so I have eaten lunch at this location probably a lot more often than my cholesterol would like, but up until recently, it was always a great experience even if it wasn't a healthy option. Then they changed management or something. 
This afternoon it took 15 minutes to get lunch in the drivethrough. No apology was given for the wait or any explanation, but I remained polite because I understand that sometimes it's busy and things get backed up. 15 minutes later we finally got our food and as we were now in a rush to get back before our lunch ended we completely didn't realize that the drinks we had ordered had not been given to us and that our order didn't have napkins or utensils of any kind and the chicken was tough and tasted old and the biscuit was overbaked and hard. 

Like I said, up until about 2 months ago (about the time that Burger King bought them) this place was good. Now, I guess I'll be looking for another quick lunch destination."}
{"text":"Do not go here at all, ever, under any circumstances, just no!

I never understood why people would bother to review chain restaurants.  Well, now I understand, if you have one location of a chain you need to AVOID.

First of all, their prices are DOUBLE the other Popeyes in town.  I expected them to be more, being in a truck stop, but double?!  We paid $6 for 2 piece w/ biscuit, $10 for 5 tenders.  Our entire order, a non excessive amount of food for 2 people, and no drinks, came to well over $20.

I watched them charge the customer in front of me $0.70 to go from a medium to a large soda.  On the printed menu right in front of us, the upcharge was $0.10.  He argued for a while, then gave up.

I asked for dark meat for my 2 piece, they gave me two tiny legs.  No thighs.  There ended up being only 4 tenders in the 5 piece tender.  We also ordered a large fry, they gave us a small.  We asked for sweet heat sauce, hot sauce, and honey.  They only gave us two of the sauces, no hot sauce, no honey.  When I asked them to correct the order they threw a few packets of hot sauce in our bag, and waived us away.

I might have stayed to fight but we were already running late, and there was a long line.  Never again."}
{"text":"We all know Popeye's is the best fast food chicken chain, so why cant they be consistent and have good customer service?

I've eaten Popeyes all over the country, including in New Orleans (yes it's better in New Orleans and it's cafeteria style there).

The Madison location is indicative of the problems all Popeyes locations have.  Sometimes the food is amazing, other times it's dismal.  Sometimes your order is correct, and sometimes it's not.  Sometimes they will fix your order when it's incorrect, sometimes they wont.  EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY WILL CHARGE YOU FOR SAUCE.  10 tenders?  Want more than 2 sauces?  Get your wallet ready.

I would swear off Popeye's entirely based on the bad experiences but it's my wife's favorite guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Thankfully I ordered something that had to be cooked to order. I don't like that with certain dishes, they don't allow you to substitute something else for the fries. I don't want fries, I want Cajun rice. They're the same price, so why can't I substitute? I would even be ok with a slight up charge. However, I was told that I would have to order an additional side at full price, even though I wouldn't be eating the fries. How is that good customer service? I had forgotten why it has been a few years since my last visit to Popeyes. Now I remember. I won't be back again for awhile, despite the food being rather yummy.  I guess to have it my way, I should have gone to Burger King. :-/ My mistake."}
{"text":"This Popeyes USED to be one of my favorite places to grab a quick bite.  The chicken was dry.  I ordered red beans and rice and got mashed potatoes.  My iced tea tasted old and oh, they didn't even bother to give me a spoon for the potatoes.  The girl at the drive thru window was rude and practically tossed the bag to me.  Never again.  There are newer Popeyes in better areas that still serve the chicken, biscuits and red beans and rice I love!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and disorganized

Frier issue so had to wait for 10 plus minutes before chicken was available 

Chicken tasted funny, definitely lower quality than other locations 

The location is tired, definitely needs a remodel. It doesn't even seem that clean"}
{"text":"Halal Meat is served here.  Owner's are known Muslims. Stopped in here after shopping at Yorkdale Mall. Tried the spicy chicken sandwich with the mash potato and drink meal combo. Also tried the chicken tenders. Everything was very tasty. Plenty of seating inside."}
{"text":"Today I went to Popeye's for lunch. I got one of their lunch deals, which consisted of 2 pieces of chicken and the potatoes with gravy. The chicken was fresh and the side was hot. The food was great and the drive thru was quick. 

Have not been disappointed with this place yet, great food and great staff. Perfect place for a quick, quality meal. Especially if you like chicken as much as I do!"}
{"text":"Out and about on a Saturday afternoon with my kiddo and ran across this establishment in the sunnyslope neighborhood. This location is on the southwest corner next to sunnyslope high school. Decided to dine in and had the tastiest and spiciest fast food chicken meals."}
{"text":"Almost every time we come here they either mess up the order or they take forever. 

Case in point: Today, I came through the drive-thru. Ordered 3 tackle boxes and a 4 pc combo. I paid and was asked to pull up front because the shrimp took a little longer. I was told 4 mins. 

I waited 20 mins and finally sent my daughter in. The girl who was cooking said she was just getting to it. My daughter came out and told me the dining room had about 5 tables occupied. I called twice to speak to a manager. No answer. 

Pulled back around to the drive-thru window (no line). Spoke to a kid dressed as the manager but who claimed to only be training. Another employee came running to the window with my order and an attitude saying that it was done. My receipt was timestamped for 3:13pm and they weren't even busy. Clock in my car is reading 3:43. I'm getting my order exactly 30 mins later. 

I tell them a discount needs to be applied. \"Manager in training\" can't do this and runs back to ask permission from someone named Bianca who tells him no, all he can offer is a large drink or a free side. I don't want more food, i want this inconvenience corrected!! 

I ask for the district manager's name and number. He writes it down for me and i leave. I call. The number is disconnected. I call the store back and someone picks up and immediately hangs up without saying a word. 

This location is ran by a bunch of rude little kids that dont know what theyre doing. BTW when i got home...our order was wrong. Smdh absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Chicken is good   BUT SERVICE HERE SUCKS .... Employees are RUDE THATS INCLUDE THE MANAGER . Attention Corporate you guys need to take a look at this location most of the employees here are RUDE"}
{"text":"This is the worst chicken I ever eat. The meal was cold and fries sooooo hard. We ask for fresh they said take another 20 min for fresh!! They give the wrong order to us and unfortunately it takes 10 min to fix it!! Just say because she is a new employee!!.
All the 5 pieces wings we order have 4 pieces!!
The worst cold chicken we ever eat and slowest employee I ever seen"}
{"text":"food and service were trash. everything was super dry"}
{"text":"Staff was awesome , food was very very good - first time here and let me tell you if you like spicy this is the place to be . Please don't read the bad reviews the staff is super friendly and the place is supper clean . Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Searching far and wide for a better than average lunch and I sure didn't find it here.  My family, mostly now residing towards the South East, assured me Popeyes would blow the socks off both KFC and Churches so I made the 8 mile drive to the nearest location.

The chicken was about the same as Churches, and dry.  The mac and cheese wasn't near as good as KFC.  They were out of fries, and several items I heard others request.  I could not find the label for root beer.  Almost half the tables were still dirty from the last user.

OK, we need some pluses here.  The lunch was like $6.  The biscuit was good.  There was no up charge for white meat.

Conclusion: If I was in the mood for inexpensive fried chicken and a Popeyes was the closest I would probably go there but I would not drive past one of their competitors to get to one."}
{"text":"I enjoy Popeyes. I came to this location to pick up dinner for me and my friend and they were very friendly and the food was really good. We had enough chicken to last us for 2 days  which was good. I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Improvements made to service.Had issues around wait times,communication and overall service but noticeable changes for tge better thus far.Food standard is good and generally no complaints there."}

{"text":"I ordered the Popcorn Shrimp at around 11:45 AM.While I appreciated getting my order within a minute or two,I would have gladly waited another 5 to get a hot and quality product.Many of the shrimp were dried out and as hard as a rock.Not a one of them was hot or succulent.They should not have been served to a customer!"}
{"text":"We rarely eat at fast food places but when we do it is only at places that prove themselves to do a good job.  Popeye's may make it into that category.  
KFC is no longer on our list due to a nasty aftertaste and unpredictable service.
The people at Popeye's were laid back but nice and helpful.  The menu looks pretty good and the fact that you can get a po boy or catfish is super nice.   But for this being our first time we got chicken.
Ordering was easy, the board was clean, new and easy to read.
Everything was done excellently.   Moist inside, good flavor, not a greasy breading and no yucky aftertaste.
The blackened ranch isn't anything spectacular.  
The rice was nothing spectacular.
Good prices.  I paid two dollars less for my chicken meal than I recently paid at a different restaurant for half the amount of food.
It gets 4 stars for our first time and we will be back to try again.

update... stopped by again and ordered a bucket of the spicy chicken.   Delicious.   Really great Louisiana flavor.  biscuits, mashed potatoes, beans with rice just average to good.  But the chicken is great.  Nice staff.

Update...just read the ingredients for their chicken and it has MSG high on the list.  They also use a lot of artificial colorings.  Why?  Anyway, though the food is very good we can no longer purchase their chicken until they change their recipe to something more healthy."}
{"text":"First off, the staff was rude and unprofessional. My food was cold and the pie I purchased for $2 was tiny/a waste of money. I suggest you visit another location if possible."}
{"text":"I ordered from this Popeyes at the drive-through. It took 15 minutes to get my order for eight pieces of spicy chicken.By the time the food came and was hot and crispy.  Turned out when in the store and they never got our order from the drive-through. So we sat outside for 15 minutes for nothing. But went into check on the order no one said hello or anything very unorganized"}
{"text":"OMG Horrible, I mean I have come to expect to have to check every order that I order at any Popeyes, they are notorious for giving away other people's orders or screwing yours up completely. Forgetting fries, gravy, endless.

Well this time the gravy was literally ice cold, nobody bothered to turn the machine on. The chicken was truly greasy and awful, tasted like it had been sitting there for days."}
{"text":"This location should close their doors.  A chicken place with no chicken! I requested a meal to be told it would be a 15 minutes wait. I asked if I would receive anything complimentary for my wait.  The inexperienced young minimum wage worker asked through her headset if they would comp me.  Another very young chicken-head incompetent worker shows up and they begin to say are you telling her, or should I. I was like HELLO! I CAN HEAR YOU! I drove away and shook my head.  I hope you go out of business.  Maybe sell peanut butter, and jelly sandwiches.  Oh yeah...hire older than teens to run your business too!"}
{"text":"I went through the drive-thru. Ordered my family meal of 8 pieces of mild chicken. Got the corn and mashed potatoes with gravy for sides. Got my order very quickly through the drive-thru.  Got home and my chicken was still crispy and hot!"}
{"text":"Living in Yuma, a 3-hour trip either to San Diego or Phoenix to eat Popeye's. And it's worth it; my wife doesn't get sick afterward like she does after eating other chicken places.

 This one was nice enough but some jerk parked like a crazy person in front, blocking 2 spots. 

 Anyways we got the $10 5 pcs / 2 sides and a drink. Results:

- The biscuits get 5 stars
- The sides (Mac 'n cheese / mashed potatoes) fared okay
- Chicken: 4 stars

 So... \"When in Rome, do as the Romans do...grab some Popeyes!\"

P.S. When using the male bathroom, this particular urinal has \"splashback.\" You've been warned!!"}
{"text":"I come here at least twice a week since they opened for business, and never fails I am waiting 10 to 15 minutes for a drive thru order. But Today takes the cake, waiting 25 minutes and they bought my order out to another lady waiting who took it back in and bought out another order which was still not hers but mines and they were not even gracious enough to say do want a drink for waiting 25 minutes and we gave your food to someone else and that we still gave you the food that they went through. This is horrible and the last time I give my business."}
{"text":"hate hate hate havn to leave bad reviews, buuuuut sometimes u just gotta... i had a long ass day today. was tired, dirty and starving. def in no mood to either cook or eat at a sit down restaurant. so on my way home saw a popeyes n decided to go w/that... didnt look busy, a few cars in the drive thru so i decided to go in.  ughhh... 20 minutes standing in line just waiting to place my order. the other customers waiting were very angry losing their cool, but i could see that the one guy at the register was tryin his best and im not a jerk so i was patient... idk what the heck was goin on - if the entire staff was brand new and had no knowledge of anything, but it was kind of ridiculous!! everyone except the guy at the register were moving in slow motion!!! from the time i walked in til the time i walked out it was 33minutes!!! wana hear somethin funny?? the company's slogan is \"Louisiana Fast\"  lolol"}
{"text":"Do you like chicken? I do!! Popeyes offers different flavors for their fried chicken. Mild to spicy. Think Cajun style. They offer many different sides too. The mashed potatoes are good but the gravy is a little spicy. I really like their fries because they are seasoned. Yes fried chicken with fries is actually good. The staff was nice and my food came out hot."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Popeyes. I will say the chicken was pretty good. It is a little spicy compared to other chicken places. So if you like the Cajun style I would check this place out. They offer many different sides to go along with your chicken. I did the mash potatoes and gravy. The gravy is also spicy but I actually liked that. It was different. This location is pretty busy. Lunch time is backed up inside and drive-thru so make sure you have plenty of time and not in a rush. Service was okay. The guy behind the counter kept making \"for here\" orders as \"to go\" orders. It kept messing people up. It wasn't a typo because my receipt said \"dine in\". Let's hope this issue gets fixed."}
{"text":"I just want to give a shout out to Nacia. (Hope i spelled that right, the ink was coming of the receipt) thank you for being so friendly and patient! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Surprised there are not more reviews for this place, Popeye's in the airport? I had to... and it was SO good. I don't even remember the last time I had Popeye's, but that was so worth it. $7.99 for 2 piece chicken combo w/ one side, a biscuit and a drink. Chicken was tasted freshly cooked, not like it had been sitting out all day in grease. The mashed potatoes came with gravy and were really tasty. I got BBQ sauce also, which was an extra $.64 cents? 

Anyways, this place is perfect if you're on your way home, possibly hungover and want something savory and hearty."}
{"text":"I would rate better but the service is poor at this location. I just went through drive through and not only did the girl with freckles refuse to take multiple orders from my car, she became indignant about it. She said \"we can only take one oder per car!\". I had several people in my car and we wanted individual orders.  When i said I've never heard of such policy, she said \"WELL YOU HAVE NOW\"

Needless to say, ive initiated a customer service report at their corporate headquarters (877-767-3937). 

I will await to hear back from them."}
{"text":"Seriously, avoid this location like the plague that it is.  Popeyes is amazing... it's fried chicken so it, by definition, cant be bad. But if you're in the mood, go to a different location or a nearby KFC.  

The place has no management.  The workers are very inefficient, very off-putting, and incredibly incompetent.  Let's discuss why.

Very inefficient.  They have a small menu and don't even have half the items to order.  Everyone at the drive through had to pull into the parking lot and wait ~15 minutes minimum.  This was at 5:00pm on Sunday, which I would imagine is a pretty hot time to have your ducks in a row to increase throughput and sales.

Very off-putting.  The staff was very rude.  They had an unfriendly tone when they mentioned they were out of an item, they showed distaste and rolled their eyes when they had to walk to the car to give you your drive through order (which could be avoided by increasing efficiency).  

Incredibly incompetent.  They are willing to give you 100 napkins (wasting money for the owner) but they will not give you your full order the first time (I guess saving money for the owner).  Make sure to check your order is all there...but in reality you shouldn't even go here to have this problem.  They missed half of it.  The fried chicken was fine, but don't expect spicy even if you order it; that would require additional work the employees are not willing to perform.  

My opinion, all employees need to get canned and management needs to figure out how a business should run or this place needs to shut down.  It gives Popeyes a bad reputation and ultimately is a waste of money for me, the customer."}
{"text":"This is the worst location I've been to. Everything takes 30 minutes to make and the staff are always extremely confused. The complete opposite of fast food."}
{"text":"Let me start off saying that I loved Popeyes, till today. I went into this location to get me some lunch and everything was normal till I saw that one of the cooks dropped a entire batch of freshly cooked bone in chicken and then she picked it up and put it in the warmer for customers. So at this point I was kind of sketchy on if I should even buy my lunch from here or not but my stomach was growling so I went ahead and ordered a 3 piece chicken strip meal. Once I sat down to eat it I noticed that it had a strange Greece film on the chicken which didn't seem normal to me but like I said I was starving so I ate it. It's been about a hour or so and now I'm running back and forth to the rest room. I'm throwing up and crapping it all out. ILL NEVER BE BACK POPEYES"}
{"text":"When to get food from this location a couple weeks ago. The girl doing drive thru was just not liking her job or was just plain rude. She asked me to order when I was ready, I said ok, couple seconds later she was like, ok what can I get for you. I told her give me a min, then I asked a question about the meals. She gave me a smart remark back like don't you see the menu... I asked for three different sauces for my chicken fingers and she said you only get one. I said ok can I get three please and she doesn't say anything. I got my food and thank goodness I checked before leaving. My boyfriends shrimp had 5 little small shrimp in this big box. I parked and went in and asked if this is what I get for the money I paid. Guy looked in box and was like \"o wow, no let me get you the right amount of shrimp. I looked in box it was a half a box, good amount. I was like wow who ever fix that box really tried to get me. I really think it was the girl in drive thru since she was looking at me crazy when I came in. After this I said never again will I come here again. I gave one star because not everyone was rude. But food could have been better as far as freshness."}
{"text":"hours are not consistent with what's showing online. Says they close at 11, they close at 10. On Wednesdays only. Who's closed on a Wednesday at that time like wth that's so random like Wednesday the middle of the week!"}
{"text":"You need to watch there guys. They will charge you wrong. 

I have also had my order come cold a few times. 

All things said, I am not sure that there are good locations in town, however this one seems considerably  worse than others I been too. 

Either way I usually order fingers with a mix of spicy and regular, I really prefer the spicy, but to much of the spicy effects my stomach the next day. 

I really love their mash potatoes and gravy. 

2 stars because consistency and screw ups."}
{"text":"Hello to all be alert that Albemarle Road Popeyes Chicken is the worst I have ever tasted the service on 5/25/18 I purchase 11 piece box of chicken for $12.99 six biscuits would 3.49 if fish platter for $8.89 my total was $28 the food was overcooked couldn't identify the 2 Little fish was like cardboard need to be five dollars better yet they should give it away free terrible management service tried to make me repurchase would not refund attitude all the way. Manager on duty is a tall African-American with a Ball head very ghetto\". I dislike when some people think that everybody is out to get over putting you in the category of everybody that is in the neighborhood.(RR)"}
{"text":"Service is fast, friendly, and refreshing.  Manager was so upbeat that it quickly set the tone for the consumers she was serving and made for a pleasant experience.

Food is what one might expect from a fried food operation, but with a little more flair.  Decently priced individual and family chicken, fish, and shrimp meals and sides.  

I usually crave places like this or Long John Silvers about once a year but found my recent meal to be too salty.  Not sure if this was due to the hands of the preparer or not.

The restaurant is dimly lit, not in an unappealing way, but more so than any fast food restaurant I have seen.  It almost made me wonder if this design helps disguise the not -so- clean dining area.  Couldn't help but notice that my shoes stuck to the floor as I walked, and the restroom conditions were on the dirty side.  My visit did come at the end of the day, but the restroom still needed some tidying up for their patrons."}
{"text":"I ordered their 5 piece chicken wings and three of the pieces still had hair attached to it.... there were sooo many it was disgusting. This place needs to clean their chicken. I am so disturbed, DO NOT ORDER THEIR WINGS! THEY DONT REMOVE THE CHICKEN HAIR! Yuck"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst service on the planet!!!!!!!!! The staff is completely incompetent! It's fine that I had to wait 15 minutes  for my food but I had to go to the counter 4 times to get what we needed to eat. Whoever is the owner of this restaurant  you need to retrain your staff fast!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly great. The service was fast. The spicy three piece was juicy and delicious. The biscuit was buttery and tasty. Don't tell my dr but I took pieces of the crispy skin and put them in my beans and rice. Fantastic. This is great airport food. 5 airport stars."}
{"text":"When you're all burgered out and for the unbearable interregnum between releases of the Double Down or the McRib, Popeyes is a nice alternative. I hear what reviewer Kevin is saying about delivery. As eat in, I was not subject to the vagaries of a minimum wage bag packer. 

Popeyes reminds me a bit of Jack in the Box state-side, although not quite the kitchen sink approach of Jack in the Box (burgers plus tacos plus fried chicken plus teriyaki plus samosas plus pad thai plus bundaegi...okay I make some of that up).  I do like they have biscuits. That's so American. An almost \"chicken and waffles\" level of American authenticity. I nearly wet myself (more about that later). I quite enjoyed the biscuits and they're a nice break from fries.

Besides the biscuits you want to try the \"dirty rice\" which was renamed \"Cajun rice\" because while everyone knows what \"dirty rice\" means exactly in the dirty south, people in other places don't want to eat dirty stuff. It's much like how they renamed Harry Potter and the Philosopher Stone for American kids who don't want to be seen reading philosophy. Or they renamed \"Nanaimo Bars\" to \"Freedom Fingers Now with Plant Sterols\" because all the vowels made the food item seem too Eastern European.

I had the chicken wraps which come with rice and were pretty tasty.

The only issue I had is the first table I sat at, there was the noticeable scent of urine. This is Yonge street, just west of hooker town. I had to quickly pick up and move my stuff to a table that smelled less of urine."}
{"text":"Count you chicken if you're ordering more than 2 pieces, they give you less than you've ordered"}
{"text":"We got 5 orders of their Tuesday Two Piece Special which comes with a Thigh and Drumstick. They asked if we wanted it to be separate which was nice because at other locations they would just put them all into one box, which results in soggy chicken. 

They advised us it would be a 15 min wait which was fine. 30 mins later back home, the chicken was super hot and juicy, dripping with chicken goodness (not oil) with each bite. The parking is still a nightmare, however this is one of the better locations with good service and fresh chicken."}
{"text":"Yelp thinks this place is closed.   That is probably just wishful thinking.   The place is open, but it shouldn't be.   Absolutely horrible service!   I ordered what I wanted, they served me something different.   I complained.  They still got it wrong.   I complained again.   The lady got pissed at me.   I called the number to complain, I was told the manager was too busy and I should call back later."}
{"text":"Some people get a haircut when they want to change their life or signal to themselves they're ready to move on. Some people buy a sports car. I go to Popeyes. 

I'm not sure why. I guess I enjoy the different menu. And I like to order biscuits in Canada. But I have to say this is the second Popeyes I've been to on Yonge street that smells like a bathroom. The one farther north had the distinct smell of urine. This one smelled like a freshly mopped bathroom that was mopped by a less than fresh mop. Well. No urine smell. So that's something.

The inside is a bit dark and dingy. Don't expect to walk out of here full for less than $9. Mashed potatoes? Mac 'n' cheese? On a menu? That's something. I also tried the shrimp sandwich, hoping beyond hope I'd find something in Canada similar to Lotteria Korea's shrimp burger (sae oo bugah). Sadly, it was a kind of popcorn shrimp on a bun. The shrimp kind of rolls off. Maybe more sticky sauce? I could have pressed down on the bun, maybe. I dunno. I don't like to press things.

The mashed potatoes were quite nice. $2 tho? Mmmm. Maybe next time I'm ready to move on."}
{"text":"I'm so torn about this review. The food is always delicious but it takes forever to fill a simple order. I went through the drive thru today and ordered 2 meals. The woman at the window told me that my chicken tenders would be 2 or 3 minutes and asked me to park, and they would bring my food out to my car. I parked and waited, and waited, and waited.... 18 minutes later, she brought my food out! How does 2 to 3 minutes turn into 18 minutes? It's really unacceptable for a drive thru to take that long, considering it's considered \"fast food\"."}
{"text":"My love for fried chicken is unimaginable and I'm so glad this Popeyes is so darn close to my place. Their chicken, fries and mashed potatoes are to die for. I've tried their Mac and cheese and it was a meh. 

I've been going to this location for years and the food has always been consistent unlike kfc (I also love kfc). I also love their daily specials hola Tuesday and Thursday!

So today (Friday) I've decided to be adventurous and try their poutine. I was actually surprised at how good they are considering I've never had good poutine from a fast food chain before. Lots of cheese curds yum! And they're squeaking as we speak. Some burger chains also can't produce such decent poutine. Sigh. 

However, the service is a hit or miss. 

Overall good job guys!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and the best food hands down Imran and team job well done well definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I hadn't read on the reviews of this store before, but I till you what. I see how low this one is stared and I can't believe that #Popeyes allows this franchise to still be here. Called corporate last time and they never did return the call.  So it is obvious they don't care. This isn't the first experience of them having orders wrong, earlier in the year we had two wrong in a row! 

I usually go through the drive through here, but I won't ever again, nor will I visit ever again. When we got home after ordering an eight piece meal and only seven were included and they weren't even right as there was 1 spicy and the rest mild rather than 1 mild and the rest spicy. The fries and jambalaya were cold as well. 

When we called them, and asked for the Manager we got David. He was like so what mistakes happen, drive the twenty minutes back to get your one piece. It was explained to him that we were in for the night because I had taken my pain meds(just blew my ankle apart and having surgery the next morning) and could drive. Why don't they have a delivery service send it over and apologize, or pay for us an Uber he refused and only said if I am on duty next time I will give you your chicken and that was all he would do. I wanted to return all the food but couldn't because after the pain meds I can't drive. 

Over all I like spicy chicken and #Popeyes in general, but I will not return to this one, and more than likely any of them any time soon. For this evening, I didn't want it but ordered pizza because they deliver. I am waiting on that now."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a 5 piece tenders for 25 minutes. Still waiting for my food. I've been through 2 32 oz sodas. Why? Not sure. There has been food on the warmers the whole time."}
{"text":"So I went by to order the 10 for 10 deal... mistake I made was ordering a large mashed potatoes... got home no potatoes... Another 12 mile trip to end up with warm potatoes and cold chicken for dinner... I guess they're only good at one thing... The chicken... by the way ... they barely said  they were sorry when I went to pick up the potatoes... they didn't even offer free apple pie... guess I'm going to try the Colonels hot chicken next time... bye-bye Popeyes"}
{"text":"Quick and delicious popeye store, really nice staff . Plenty of parking. I love their cajun chicken sandwich and chicken nuggets.rip n chicken is good too. Another of my favorite place for fast food lovers."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Popeyes. 

The service here is much better than their Yonge-Dundas location.
I also find the chicken here is less greasy and hot/freshly made. 
There's a decent amount of seating and even a TV! 

I've been here at various hours of the day (12, 7pm, 3am) and will certainly miss this place when the condos come up."}
{"text":"They are very bad and so rude. Filled my order wrong with spicy I called as I was home and found out then. They said sorry and that they would replace it. When I went back they said no they don't do that and needed to bring it back that day and the food not what was said on phone. And the young boy maybe son wanted to even get into a fist fight. So no a good way to do business. This must be a franchise as all others have been great so I will just go to a different one. Greenway  and 35th Ave much better"}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Great food!!! Added bonus today... we got to enjoy the pre-opening!  Met the top management, new staff and some corporate members, every single person there wad top notch, friendly & helpful!!!"}
{"text":"Location has gone downhill... Too many kids working here now.. Biscuits are dry and stale as hell. I rarely eat here anymore and now it will be even less"}
{"text":"Can you say PISSED... So me and boyfriend were up thinking hmmmmm. Lets go here to get lunch and since they were just opening we ASSUMED all the food would be fresh. WRONG!!!! To the Tune of $30.00 my boyfriend comes home with food that must have been left from closing the night before. We were hungover but NOT desperate! I politely called and explained our plight. The Manager said bring it back with your receipt. We took Everything even the Apple pies (Which were actually fresh) but since I wasted Time,Gas,And delayed my family from eating we didn't want ANY of it at this point. The Manager NEVER looked at the food, NEVER apologized, and Heck she NEVER even looked at me.. So we drove an hour to Monroe NC to eat Quincys and all the items were FRESH and $4.75 cheaper... lol I guess we won. My advise for this Popeyes!!!  Stay Away At The Top Of The Day!! LoL"}
{"text":"Growing up in New Orleans and being a frequent visitor to Atlanta, I've definitely had more Popeyes than most. When they started \"popping\" up in Charlotte I was very excited. One thing to know is, the service is pretty much the same no matter which one you visit. I know this isn't the other chicken place that is frighteningly scary with everyone there smiling, but I go to Popeyes for the food. 

I normally get the shrimp po' boy or the chicken strips. On this day, they had a sign out for Rip n Chicken, which I tried to get before but they were sold out. I placed an order for them and then the devastating news was broken to me that the Rip n Chicken special was over. I could feel my chest sink in and eyes starting to water.

Never the less, I ordered the chicken strips with a side of red beans and rice instead. It was prepared fast and the ladies that took my order were both nice. When I ate my food, it was exactly as I expected. Until it wasn't. For the first time ever, I was served a pretty large piece of thick skin. And it also looked to be the part near the rear end, if you catch what I'm throwing. It almost made my stomach turn it was so disgusting to look at. 

Even though this happened, I don't blame the people there as they would have not known it was there. I blame the people at Popeyes that are over the quality control of the meats. I'm not sure how I feel about this, as I love Popeyes and have had a pretty consistent run of eating there, but this will stop me going for awhile, until I at least forget all about it."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give this Popeyes one star but I have to in order to leave a review. It's always a nightmare coming to this place you have to be a customer and an employee when you come here because you ask for something and then they say is that it? Like ask me what kind of sauce would I like or what kind of side would I like. I have to ask so aren't you going to ask me what side or sauce I want then they ask. I have to always remind my self to ask for honey for my biscuit because their stingy with the sauce and really don't seem to care. Make sure you check your bag before you drive off even though you tell them what sauce you want they will always get it wrong. Service seems to be better during the day at night it's literally a nightmare. They need to hire or train their employees and get a new manager or something this place is literally a nightmare you've been WARNED"}
{"text":"Not sure why there's so many complaints. Yall expect 5 star service at a fast food joint? These people do their best to serve some bitchy customers who are hungry. I give them 5 stars for dealing with all of them. 

I came here on a Tuesday with my wife and kid. We all know what the deal is on Tuesday. The place is packed and so is drive thru and all the customers here want to complain about how slow the service is. I ask if the people are waiting in line and all they can say is that they've been waiting x amount of time. Did I ask how long you were waiting? Just tell me if you're in line. Anyway the people working were calm with all the complaints they hear. More power to the workers. 

Oh as far as the food, you can't go wrong with Popeyes! I'm not a fan but my son loves it here."}
{"text":"Never fails... Terrible service and more than likely they mess up my order. Last time I went I was literally in the drive thru for about 15 min and with only 2 cars in front of me..."}
{"text":"I give it two stars for the poor customer service in the drive thru from in guessing some shift leader or manager. I ordered two 5 piece chicken tenders and when I got to the window ordered a drink and she scoffed and said really and got rude like I the customer was such a burden ... don't worry I won't be back"}
{"text":"I went to this location 12229 after work to pick up food for my pregnant wife and my self. Not only did it take me over 8 minutes to get my food as I sat at the window my order was completely incorrect. Normaly I don't do these surveys but it caused a major issue and we could not eat the food.
 From what I orders for my wife mild 2pc big box upgraded to breast with mash potatoes and coleslaw ( this is what she's craving).
For my self I ordered the 3 pc spicy tenders with Cajun fries for both sides and a extra side of red beans and rice.

From looking at the boxes I received all chicken no tenders. 
No red beabs and rice instead they give mash potatoes.
The fries where cold and old.
My wife couldn't eat her chicken cuz they gave spicy not mild for both.
Lucky she was Abel to eat both sides of mash potatoes and the Cole slaw while the rest of the food went into the garbage. I called the store before and told them the situation and the lady who answered the phone \" Popeyes can i help you\" I explained the situation and she stated \"well if you want you can bring it back\" I live in vegas and at this time it's rush hour me going to that store would take about 40 minutes there and back. No other solution was given i felt as if i was rushed off the phone as just another piece of trash thrown away as if it is not her problem. I would like this fixed  $14.58 was spent I don't want my money back i just want it made right!"}
{"text":"Shut the place down. Does not honor Tuesday or any other specials. Save a buck and loss a million. Hey, ur business to run into the ground. Customer svc is a joke . The staff act as if they did you a favor by coming to work. Worst, popeyes on the planet. Would not go back if the food was free."}
{"text":"I will start by saying if I could give a negative 10 stars then I would. I waited for 30 mins inside to be told there was no shrimp. Then they were out of red beans. They gave me no drink cup, napkins or fork . So I finally sit down to eat and then they messed up my order. The only thing they got right was the spicy chicken tenders and for the price they were only as big as my finger and I do not have big hands. I had ordered a cherry pie and of course they gave me apple. The line was so long that you couldn't go up front to try to get your order fixed. I threw half of my dinner in the trash since it wasn't what I ordered . Also they did not even give me a biscuit. How can they mess up that bad? This has got to be the worst service of all restaurants in Las Vegas. If you have a day or week to wait for your food and you like being surprised at what you actually get then have at it here. If not stay away from this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Bad salty greasy chicken... But the staff is nice!"}
{"text":"Hard to find good fried chicken!

First time ever at a Popeye's and walking in the food smelled good and the place was clean, but that's about all.
Women working the counter did not want to be there. Being at Popeye's for the first time I had a lot of questions but it seemed like I was bothering her. 
So I decided on the 10 piece deal for $20 with half spicy crispy and half regular with \"gumbo\" and mash potato, also an order of fried shrimp.
Got home (5 mins away) and was disappointed with the shrimp it was super dry. 
A few pieces of chicken were pretty ok, I did like the spicy ones. And a few pieces were very dry!
The so-called gumbo was dry just red rice!?
The mash potato was pre-mixed with gravy which is dumb in my opinion so there is nothing to dip the biscuit in.

The Bottom line is realisticly I will probably never go Popeye's again... I wish I could get my $25 dollars back."}
{"text":"The service was horrible today. They gave me a drumstick that looked like it came from a wing! I asked for a different piece and the guy working gave me a smaller piece and threw the other piece out. I told him to just give it to me because he's going to throw it out anyway. 2 pieces would make one piece."}
{"text":"Says they close at 10pm tonight.... drove by at 9:45 and all the lights are off. Open sign is off and not a single person. Seriously?"}
{"text":"Employees are fun. Good spirits. Helpful. Great food. Clean and great background music. Will be back."}
{"text":"Very good service.  Very friendly staff. I have tried many different Popeyes. This one had perfect chicken not too oily , crisp and done just perfect. It's a clean very nice place to sit. I always go here even though I have another branch near my house just because of the great food and even better service."}
{"text":"I recommend trying Popeyes! 

Positives:
We tried the new Popeyes on Pebble Creek Parkway and we weren't sorry.  I've never had it before and I was not let down.  I wasn't sure I'd be able to order anything at a fried chicken joint that would fit in my daily calories.. Shockingly it wasn't bad!! I was able to order chicken tenders, green beans and mashed potatoes with gravy.  The regular portions are not very large and I am assuming this is why.  You can always order the large though!  

They have regular or spicy tenders and both were good! Next time I'd do the spicy I tried the hubby's and they were good. Their sauces were also good! I am a sauce snob I can't lie but was still impressed. The green beans had wonderful flavor and I would say I much prefer their mashed potatoes and gravy to kfc.  But they are along the same lines I would say.

Negatives:
Hmm.. I don't think I have any complaints? I enjoyed the food, for what it was."}
{"text":"One star for this location has nothing to do with the food. I've been to this location twice and both times they forgot my honey for my biscuits! Idk about you but I can out eat their biscuits without honey. Even when I specifically asked for it! But that's not why I'm writing my review. Was gonna go there today but it just so happened I only had a $50 bill on me. I know some fast food joints won't accept bills larger than $20 so I called to make sure so for one my time isn't wasted driving there ordering food and two the food itself won't be wasted. A guy with a strong Filipino accent (don't come for me I'm Filipino myself lol) answered and confirmed they do accept bills larger than $20 IF ITS REAL... Am I wrong to feel offended by this comment?! I told him why wouldn't it be real the hell? Hung up and went to Canes instead will not come back to this location. I know y'all are new but whoever the manager is please speak to this employee to choose his words wisely when speaking to customers."}

{"text":"I'm not sure why the rating of this restaurant is 2 Star. I've been here 8 times never have problems, and I ask a lot of condiments and request such as forks and honey, they always obliged, without problems, and they have the best chicken and to die for sweet and sour sauce ."}
{"text":"We were greeted with a warm welcome back. I guess they thought they remembered me..... I know that's how they great everyone but I figured they recognized me from the tele. Chicken was decent-most of my 1/2 regular & 1/2 spicy order was moist. Skin was crispy. Spicy wasn't too spicy. They have sweet tea plus the new Coke dispensers so you have a million drink options. They are definitely sauce nazi's though, you only get 2 per large meal & 1 for little meals. I tried a couple of their new ranch dipping sauces and wasn't too impressed. It's fast food chicken so I can't see getting to excited but if your craving, you've got to fill the void."}
{"text":"The chicken was good----as expected. Crispy eight piece family meal with delicious biscuits and tasty Cajun fries. With spicy gravy on the side. The staff in charge of bussing were a bit lax on the  job, in which some empty tables were  dirty-----otherwise would come back again if in need of a fried chicken fix."}
{"text":"First of all WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE? The staff is horrible they are clueless and I'm sure they are high on something illegal. The place is unattended and very dirty the wait time for chicken is 30 mins, The manager is definitely not in his right mind! I was over charged because they didn't know how to ring up a coupon and got my order wrong!! However the chicken was not awful it actually tasted good considering the pigsty it was made in. Someone please clean up the crew and the place it's sad to see a good place sink to filthy levels  re-train the staff or hire sane humans! Calling all health inspectors!!!!"}
{"text":"The worst dining experience I have had in over 20 years. The manager had no control over the staff or the experience to manage anyone! Her answer to everything was, just a second even after letting them know I had not received my food and people after me were already taken care of and gone. She had no idea how to manage staff let alone manage a business. I finally got my money back after waiting 45 minutes for chicken, popcorn shrimp and chicken fingers, simple food that was already prepared but with their ineptness they could not even figure out to complete. If you go, get a good look at the kid at the counter who walked from side to side but went unnoticed by the manager and he stood there with a blank stare on his face and could not even manage to put chicken in a box, whoever hired this manager and the inept, useless individual behind the counter, you should be fired!"}
{"text":"The worst customer service from the managers and the empoyees. They never get the orders right. Something as simple as a #4 . It's sad when they can't put chicken in a box. I'm sure they cost this company a lot of money. Where is undercover Boss when you need them."}
{"text":"TLDR: better service; busy Tuesdays; connected to Chevron; limited seating; drive-thru available

I'm really surprised at most of the Yelp Reviews. I expected more stars, but maybe there's a tough crowd. 

I frequent this facility on Tuesdays due to our schedule and the specials. I purchase an 8-piece chicken mixed and 8 chicken strips. I usually get in the drive-thru line to expect a 15-20 min wait, so expect that. You would think that they're gonna constantly make chicken so it would be ready-to-go, so I decided to order inside to paint a picture on my head. 

So imagine waiting in the drive thru-there's 5 cars ahead of you. At the same time, there's a line of 8 waiting to order and several couples and singles standing around waiting for their order. There's like 7 employees working and busting their butt, but the amount of chicken is plentiful in the warmer, but it's only breast pieces. So for everyone ordering the mixed box which contains 1-2 breast pieces and chicken strips, and the variety between spicy vs. not, there's gonna be a wait. For me, I don't mind the wait, I would rather you fully cook the chicken. I don't want no salmonella poisoning. Ain't nobody got time for that! 

I had an issue once in terms of being incorrectly charged, the manager came over amidst the craziness and calmly resolved the issue and refunded me the difference. It was the best resolution I could have asked for in this situation. I'm also happy that like 4 people are ServSafe certified at the manager's level. This makes me feel safe eating there. 

There's always room for improvement so I give 4.5 stars, but I always round up :)"}
{"text":"This place not only has amazing chicken, but also a great manager named Tyler. He fixed an order that was messed up the night before by replacing all the food without any hassle. We will definitely continue to go there especially for the amazing Tuesday deal."}
{"text":"Thanks for the old dirty rice you gave me that I didn't ask for (I ordered red beans and rice) after you rushed me while ordering. The one star is for the biscuit even though yelp keeps changing it to two stars."}
{"text":"Mehhhh...It was Popeyes...Nothing exciting...No matter where ya go they're all the same. I prefer Churchs over Popeyes"}
{"text":"Food was ok but I like legs and thighs.  Ordered 16 piece and manager chicken and gave me 4 breast.  This after repeating order back to me.  Gave them a 2nd chance asked for 11 piece leg and thigh and was told no.  KFC is on baaeline .....they get my business now."}
{"text":"stopped at the popeyes next to applebees on elliott to pick up lunch. greeted when we entered. ordered the eight piece family meal including mashed potatoes and gravy w/ 4 biscuits along w/ an additional side of cole slaw. the legs and wings plus the thighs were less than average size. had to select breasts of the spicy variety as they were out of original mild type flavoring. they were exceptable size. cost us over $21 for the meal to take out.when we began eating the pieces i immediately noticed that they apparently had been using the cooking oil too long as it tasted old and had an off taste to it. all in all, if you want to eat this type meal, go to churches for a much better meal w/ larger pieces and better tasting chicken. meal was too expensive, small pieces, off taste. i guess i will just marinate and grill my own chicken in the future and pay around 99 cents/lb for grocery store purchase."}
{"text":"I experienced horrible delivery service so you don't have to.

I'm an 8-minute drive away from this location but was feeling extremely lazy so chose to order in. Huge mistake. I was initially told the order would take 45 minutes to an hour. After an hour and 15 minutes, I called the store to check in. Guy says oh yeah, the driver is on his way. Thirty minutes later (!!) I call again. He says the guy is on his way. I said, you told me that 30 minutes ago...also, the food will be super cold by now, right? He said no, the driver has warming bags.

Nearly two hours after I placed the order, the food finally arrives, and whaddayaknow, everything is ice cold. And adding insult to injury, they forgot dipping sauce for the chicken tenders. Brutal!

Moral: if you're craving a fried chicken grease bomb and you want it delivered midtown, just call KFC. The chicken isn't the same as Popeyes but at least you'll get it promptly."}
{"text":"I usually get good, hot chicken when I visit at lunch time.  Evenings are a different matter.
The drink dispenser has major issues.  They have a good product, but quality and wait time are inconsistent."}
{"text":"Let me just say I am so glad I decided to go inside this n popeyes instead of the drive thru. The experience we got with our cashier was incredible. Not sure what her name was but she was probably in charge because she was the only one wearing a green shirt. We asked about their wicked chicken and she let us try two full strips before buying it. Of course it was delicious because popeyes is definitely the best of all the chicken places out there. She let us try all the dipping sauces with no dirty looks or extra charges like some other places do when you ask for extra ketchup. We will for sure be going back there regularly. If I could give this 7 stars it would have them."}
{"text":"Sheesh! I feel like I spent an hour in line waiting. But there's no way to get out the drive-thru! Red beans were super thin and order was wrong. To top it all off...food poisoning! Yay!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a franchised company so you can't really complain too much about the quality of food it's going to be the same regardless which Popeyes you go to. What makes the differences between one Popeyes and the other this one surely does lack. If you manage to get your food within 20 minutes its a slow night if it's a busy night be prepared to be waiting for about 40 to 45 minutes to get your food. When I go to order food that's deep-fried I'm expecting a little more than two napkins that they give you, then when I do go to the cashier to ask for more napkins I am headed one napkin, when I asked if I could have like 5 or 6 I got a look of disgust the napkins were basically thrown at me and I was then ignored. I figured that I would give them a try by ordering a delivery order to see if they would succeed better in that section of their business. I called the store no one answered the phone for about 15 minutes when I did finally get to talk to somebody they told me that it would be at least 90 minutes before I would be receiving my food, the restaurant happens to be a five minute walk down the street from my house. While the restaurant floors and counters and tables do appear to be clean. The excessively long wait times and the exceedingly overflowing garbages that seem to have not been emptied for the last several hours make this stop one that you will sure want to skip over."}
{"text":"Not very good.  The chicken was dried out and they screwed up my order.  I was charged extra to get 5 breasts.  My order was a to-go.  When I got home; I find two boxes of chicken.  One with 2 pieces and the other with 3.  Each box had a thigh instead of a breast.  I would not have minded too much except my wife and I don't like thighs and because each thigh was in a different box; it appears that this was intentional.  I'm sure they've handed out enough chicken to be able to tell the difference between a thigh and a breast."}
{"text":"No greeting or thank you, order incorrect, menu board price incorrect was told\" that's wrong\" then closed window. Out of product. Poor customer service, food at best ok, total lack of any quality control...not old until it's sold seems to be this stores motto. Given my ongoing experiences with this location piss poor management!!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever seen in a fast food restaurant . It looked like they had enough employees but most were walking around looking confused. I ordered an 11 piece chicken, no sides, no drinks. They had plenty of chicken in the pans to process my order. It would appear they take each order as it comes, so if they are waiting on sides it backs up orders they could fill promptly. It took 36 minutes to process my order. I don't blame the workers, it looks like a management problem. They also were telling people that they ran out of lids for the sides, really ! I won't be back."}
{"text":"So it's like any other Popeyes's but I really think they should put a sign up that you need to pay additional for sauces. In the US we get one per meal but here it's different. Not that I would have minded to pay but we had no Canadian currency and didn't want to charge the card for $.30
Any ways fried chicken was good."}
{"text":"Worst ever. I ordered a 12 pc meal, mild, legs and thighs. I was told \"you can't have only mild...you have to have mild and spicy\" wtf really? \"Also, you can't just have legs and thighs....you have to have all the different pieces\" seriously???"}
{"text":"I had to contact head office on these guys.  Bad service sucks but it happens .... not answering the phone because you know of complaints?  This is a franchise, so I know other locations may be better, but my bad experience here means I will never have anything to do with Popeyes again."}
{"text":"New location, lines at the drive-thru wrapped around the building, but moved fairly quickly.  The staff was courteous and efficient.  Ordered the shrimp po-boy, which was cold, but the onion rings were hot and delish!  This is a chicken place so maybe that's what I should have ordered.

Not bad for fast food!"}
{"text":"First time in the drive through. Pretty slow service, over 2 minute wait at the speaker before anyone even said anything acknowledging me. After I ordered I was told would be a 4 minute wait for the tenders I ordered, to which I obliged. However, after being told to pull forward and wait, it was approximately 15 additional minutes before my food was brought to me. Unacceptable for a \"fast food\" establishment."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this chain, decided to go today because we had a coupon. This location was most convenient but after reading the reviews my expectations were pretty low.
I was never so happy to be wrong. Our meal was great. It was hot and fresh, the chicken was crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. The fries were great, and the biscuits were amazing. 
The service was a little crazy, they were out of some sauces and the woman in line in front of me ordered fish and they were out of that.
But the staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean. I was impressed overall and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is twice now. You either fail to hire a capable staff or you are understaffed.  No exaggeration twenty minute wait just to order. 

Big mistake asking me to fill out the survey."}
{"text":"I pulled up Two weeks ago to order at the drive thru but the line was crazy. So I got out to order inside. As I was walking in a couple of ladies walking out saying the wait was just as bad inside so I got right back into the car and left. I thought I'd give them a try tonight and had four cars ahead of me. It took 33 minutes. Smh. Thank God my wife was in the car because I pulled out and the biscuits weren't in the bag . Had to get out and go in. They were so busy I couldn't even complain. Food was cold by the time I got home. Something needs to change. If no stars was an option that's what I'd be posting."}
{"text":"5$ box 4 shrimp 3 small tenders..RIP OFF CHRCHES from now on! Got 2 and both the same..come on! Nothing  like commercials or pics on websites"}
{"text":"I was very excited about this Popeye's opening up and have been to this location three times since its opening. The other negative reviews are accurate and reflect my experiences as well.

First, the staff members, including the managers in the green shirts, are very unprofessional. The staff is always standing and joking around and not paying attention to the restaurant. The hot sauce openings are crusty, as another reviewer mentioned, and the tables are left unwiped and dirty. It is difficult to find a clean table or seats, as they ALL have oil streaks or fried chicken crumbs on them.

Second, the food is always lukewarm. Don't count on getting a hot meal here; they serve their chicken and mashed potatoes at room temperature.

Third, they REALLY DO get your order wrong. If you decide to come here, do yourself a favor and check your order. In one of my visits, I waited for a long time and the tall male manager told me that they were waiting for the \"fries to cook.\" I didn't even order fries!!! After he finally put my meal together, he left out my mashed potatoes! It was frustrating.

In my most recent visit, I overheard the female manager having an extended conversation with a customer on the phone (in front of everybody!!), saying that she was unable to offer a refund unless they bring the food back in. It was obvious they got someone's order wrong. A few minutes into the conversation, she said in a rude voice \"I AM the manager!\" and soon hung up. She then proceeded by yelling into the kitchen requesting for some help up front."}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely terrible. The staff and managers are rude, slow and impersonal. The food is good though."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. When I was forgot about in the drive thru and had to go in after 15 minute wait (was told two minutes) and when I asked to speak to manager he was more interested in stiring the beans than addressing a customer service complaint by poor choices from HIS employee. I will drive out of my way before going back here again."}
{"text":"We went here last night (3/27) and was told the dark meat wouldn't be available for 20 minutes and they wouldn't make a substitution without upcharging us. Another customer asked the manager on duty about it, she threw her hands up and with utter indifference, exclaimed that there was nothing she could do. 

We ended up going to KFC."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I took down two stars due to a very persistent issue I've been having at this branch; The chicken tenders are cold. Every. Single. Time. This is the only Popeye's that continues to serve me cold chicken tenders every time and I have to send them back to get reheated every single time. The last straw was when the owner/manager of the branch literally picked up a chicken tender from his tray and THREW it into my box, insisting that both what I was offered and the fresh tenders were the same temperature. I was left speechless at how rude and impolite that was when I was just asking nicely to reheat them, not even make me new ones. After arguing with him (I actually had to argue for my COLD tenders), he finally made me a fresh batch of tenders, ones that were actually hot and fresh. The service is absolutely horrendous, and after being a loyal customer for 3+ years, I'm finally giving up on this branch. 

Learn how to respect your costumers first and then we'll talk. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This Popeyes is located just off highway 7 in between Leslie and Bayview. It's extremely busy around there, just being off highway 7... and across from it is a Timmies, so parking is really full, be careful if you're driving.

What can I say about Popeyes... I always love Popeyes, but who doesn't love fried chicken? I usually get a two piece or a three piece but now they have specials everyday! Their biscuits are to die for and their mashed potatoes are . The thing that really gets me into Popeyes is the chicken though, it's like no other. KFC doesn't even come CLOSE to Popeyes!

I usually go in there on a Tuesday or a Thursday because they have the best deals and I save a buck or two! Why not?! The manager took my order and was extremely quick and polite.

I would definitely recommend this place!

A happy customer.

4/5"}
{"text":"i'll include pics of a half-filled container of a family-sized mashed potatoes.  half-filled, really Popeye's?"}
{"text":"GREAT Popcorn Shrimp Basket! Haven't tried anything else yet because this is just so dang good that I can't resist not getting it when I go there! Get it!"}
{"text":"Man! I was hoping for the chicken I remember from here years and years ago. I ordered the spicy chicken tenders with fries and biscuit. I like crunchy chicken on the outside. But it was like scraping the top of my mouth and almost to that dry chicken point. Absolutely no sauce offered, not even ketchup! Be sure to ask for it! 

The fries! Now those were yummy. It was season fries and nice crunch with soft inside.  The biscuit was good, fluffy.... But some honey would have put it over the edge into awesome.

There was confusion going on in this place, considering it fairly new (well I noticed it a month or so ago) I didn't think too much about it. The main drive thru girl was getting annoyed by the others though. They kept getting in her way and she tried telling a shift leader what I had but she wouldn't listen and asked me herself. I shook my head no and the main girl had to tell her again what I ordered.

SHE knew what she was doing lol. I also saw the Mgr standing around observing but looking more like he was confused. 

Some improvements needed but it was good."}
{"text":"I just ordered a 16 piece family meal with additional items spent nearly 50.00 had to wait for my order that's cool but when I got it I asked if the extras were there they guy said yes and I got home and both orders of frys weren't in the bag. I called and told them they forgot part of my food and the girl hung up on me! I don't really care for Popeyes food but my family likes it so I gave them another chance and it seems that every time u order from any location my order is always messed up this will be my final time eating at Popeyes!!"}
{"text":"Unhappy staff.  Could be (a lot) cleaner. 
How about fixing the leaks so that the ceiling tiles don't look like crap?"}
{"text":"I normally find the food at Popeyes pretty tasty. This one was no exception. First time I'd taken my family of 5. My wife 3small boys & I. For $31.00 not only were we full but had pieces to spare. My 12yr old said , \" Dad, this is way better than even KFC!\" Not just the food but GREAT customer service. Something you just don't find much of in a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Judging from the past reviews all I can say is , \"They must be listening!\" Service was fast & friendly. They recommended the $5 box & it was what I expected from Popeyes.... Mmm good!"}
{"text":"Avoid this location at all costs. They are impatient, mess up orders, and are downright rude and unapologetic.  While it is the only Popeyes in within a walking distance from home - so I have given it plenty of chances - there are other junk food options around!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered an entire catering 
Order for 50 guys from this location .. Nora was excellent working with us and assuring both quality and price .  Our food was hot and delicious and we would certainly order from this wonderful establishment again"}
{"text":"I am a fan of fried chicken, I have to admit; however, Popeyes fried chicken is definitely not my go to when it comes to fried chicken. In a bind, I would definitely have some, but if I had to choose between this place and several other fried chickens, I wouldn't choose Popeyes. That being said, this location is ok in a sea of less than premium fast food shops. They have some good daily specials, but I definitely don't make it a habit to come here. This place is definitely one of the busier restaurants around, so if you are coming here, most likely it will be 'to go'."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE LOCATION AVOID AT ALL COSTS, the food is terrible it tastes either over salty or wayyy overcooked. Not to mention the service that is provided here is horrendous. Worst service i have ever received in my life. I understand its a fast food restaurant but it is still a restaurant and it isnt to much to ask for to ask for employees that dont show their clear annoyness when you just ask for some extra ketchup packs."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review on the odd hope that someone from Popeye's actually reads it but I doubt they will. This is the worse Popeye's in the history of bad fast food. We went here this week and absolutely nothing about the food was right. My Fried Chicken was actually soggy and had zero crisp. But the biscuit however had plenty enough crisp. It was dry and hard and had probably been sitting out all week. My wife ordered their chicken tenders and I have no idea how this was possible but they tasted like fried onion rings. Here's the real kicker: Popeye's doesn't have fried onions. 

I'm a huge fan of the chain but this store was just awful."}
{"text":"Did not like the customer service had to go back to the store because they did not get my order correct. When I went back the Manager looked at me like I was wrong for bringing it back."}
{"text":"One star as being the following reason:
Rude staff, slow service, and being cheap on the portion. 

I live in this neighbourhood and so many times I walked into the store thinking to myself: it's going to be better than the last time! And I been wrong every single time. 

Seriously, one of the worst Popeye's I've been."}
{"text":"Airport location. Airport prices. We ordered a 3 piece chicken with 1 large side - $15 bucks.. What. What! That's basically a family 8 piece meal at a location NOT at the airport.. 

3 piece chicken + 1 side (cajun fries) and an apple pie ~ $18

The prices here are ridiculous. They at least cooked the chicken right as it was nice and crisp, but it was not spicy as requested. Cajun fries were whatever. Nothing special. They weren't even hot. They forgot to give me my apple pie. When I went back to get it, the guy ended up giving me two. Didn't even bother checking my receipt.

Overall.. not a lot of places to pick from the airport. Had to resort to here. Next time I'm making sure to eat before I go or pick up food in Vegas before coming. It's at least more valuable for me to get food off the strip than the airport..

Save your money and eat before hand!"}
{"text":"This is the closest Popeyes to my house and I couldn't be more dissatisfied with the food. I love Popeyes, but this one location makes me not like it so much. The drive thru is really quick, but I always leave with something wrong with my order. Last time, they didn't give me a biscuit with my combo. The time before that, the chicken was spicy even though I asked for mild. This time, I asked for Tartar sauce with my popcorn shrimp and got Cocktail sauce instead. I HATE cocktail sauce! The employees are always laughing and playing around when I get to the window, so maybe if they spent less time focusing on flirting and goofing off and more time doing their job, this wouldn't be an issue. Save your time and money...go to another location"}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep coming back to this location to be let down every time. The staff is not knowledgeable about what items are on the menu,the wait time is outrageous and you give me cruddy chicken."}
{"text":"So I went here with my family about five minutes ago. When I ordered an eight piece mild they said it would take 15 to 20 minutes. Cool, I thought it shouldn't take that long considering I used to work at a Popeyes and I was the assistant manager for a store, I know how it works. Well, 40 minutes later...still no chicken...and my kids and I were sitting in the parking lot the whole time. So here we are sitting in very very hot temperature waiting for chicken and I had enough!  I decided to drive up to the drive-through and ask them where is our food and the guy at the window said we were looking for you but we couldn't find you. I said that's impossible I was literally 15 feet away from your drive-through window if you could clearly see me and I was next to the bus stop...stop lying! They said that they sent somebody out to come look for us but I highly doubt that. Because, again, 15 feet in front of your window if you could see me I could see you and I did not see anybody looking for us. Pathetic. I asked if they could hook it up with some free food for a consolation because if you wait 40 minutes at least give us something for it. Am I wrong in this? The guy said no and then closed the window on me. Very unprofessional and I am completely embarrassed my kids were hungry and had to let them know that we had to wait 40 minutes for something that I could've easily made myself. If this is the case I am never coming back to this location if this is how they treat customers. Never mind that I used to work at a Popeyes but the fact of the matter is that they want to say how much customers are always right is bogus now and that this franchise has changed since I used to work for it!"}
{"text":"When I placed my order, I asked to have it in a take out box so when I'm done I'll take it home in a box. The man that was serving me said he'll put it in a box when I'm ready to go so I left it as that. When I was done, I still had 4 piece left and went to ask for a take out box, they put it in a paper bag and said here, in a box. When I ask for a box, the said it's inside the paper bag, I was extremely annoyed and didn't want to be bothered by it and just decided to leave. A few reasons why I gave 1 star. 1. They lied to me about offering a replacement of the old chicken they gave me, half my order the chicken was old and dry. 2. They definitely weren't cheap in giving me ketchup packages but wouldn't even provide me with a take out box with my order of 8 piece chicken. 3. Terrible service especially for a place that ask for a tip when you order and did nothing to earn it, thank goodness I did not tip on my order otherwise I'd be freaking out about the level of service when I ask for the box they didn't give me when I had left overs as they promise they would give me. 4. The washroom was pretty disgusting, I  can barely breath down there, it seems like they don't have any ventilation for the basement washroom or something. When down to wash my hands with my kids before we ate and man, my kids were complaining more than me. I wouldn't recommend this place base on this experience."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a long distance trip across the country. What a mistake! The whole store is filthy. The employees move at a snail's pace, and have screwed up almost every order I have watched them take. Mine was wrong, as well. The board says a combo comes with a drink, but the cashier didn't give me a cup. When I asked about it, she said I would have to pay an extra $2 for the drink. With the excessive wait time for my food, it put me behind schedule for my trip. Find somewhere else for a fast meal, because you won't get it here."}
{"text":"Worst costumer service ever... u can always tell the people don't want to be there.... always closing early... always have the kitchen mostly cleaned up by ten when they close at 11 and u can see the attitude when u pull up like they are mad you're there.... and it shows in the food at this location. Like u can tell it's not made with care...lady gave me attitude in the drive through and I drove right off... went to Wendy's. Horrible service"}
{"text":"On 12/27/15 at 5.30pm I wanted  the MVP special , staff said the special is over !! It's not in their register anymore! It ends tonight-per staff! And I said on the display it says only the date 12/27/15 but not the time... If it ends tonight it should be at midnight,not whenever and all the MVP advertising should be remove if specials are over!!! And a new day always start at midnight..... Not whenever"}
{"text":"This is the only fast food place I go to, and this location finally opened by my house!  Beyond excited! I will be a regular here forever.  Don't even try to compare popeye's to KFC or anything else.  Popeye's is 10000000x better and doesn't taste like chemicals like KFC.  I hope this location has deep fried cajun turkey's for thanksgiving like I've heard other locations have."}
{"text":"No wonder overall this Popeyes has two ... the employees tonight were rude and uncaring... one guy had been waiting 35 minutes and demanded a refund and left. My husband waited 15 minutes and when we got home there was mainly dark meat instead of the 3 breasts we ordered ... and only 1 wing... AND no biscuits! (8 PC meal).   Stay away from this Popeyes... next time Will go back to the one on Craig... they are busy as hell but prepared ! And give you a free Soda  if you are waiting more than 5 minutes!  The one on Vegas Blvd sucks all around !"}
{"text":"Ordered mild chicken... waited 20 minutes and then asked counter person what the hold up was ... she said o h... another 12 minutes before chicken ready ... what the heck? My husband vows not to come here again... obviously these people don't know what's going on in the kitchen... I think the manager needs to look into the poor service at this location... or answer this complaint!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. They had all dirty tables and at 8:15 pm they started cleaning them and putting all the chairs on top the tables like they were closing. Never greeted us when we came in. A worker was back talking another worker. Tons of workers, but none wanted to help you, it was like you were bothering them. No napkins in the dining area, Never asked if I wanted butter and when I asked for honey she had a pissed off face. The mashed potatoes had a teaspoon of gravy, which is why I went there in the 1st place!!! This is the worst Popeyes I have ever been to. The guy behind me ordered one meal, he waited at least 15 minutes for it, to dine in on dirty tables!!! Unbelievable!!!"}
{"text":"I've only been there twice and they have yet to get the order right. The second time I really wanted the Cajun fries but they gave me some nasty looking rice. I live too far away to go back and have them fix it, but they should be able to READ THEIR OWN ORDER BOARD. They ask US if it's correct, but can't manage to give the right product. The (mild) chicken is okay, but the breading was so hard it hurt my teeth biting into it. Needless to say...I'M NOT GOING BACK THERE....I like the CRISPY CHICKEN A FEW BLOCKS AWAY on Bradley much MUCH better anyway."}
{"text":"First off I should mention it's WAY overpriced. Seriously it's like $7 for like a two piece. Second I got a po boy if you want to call it that it was bread slapped with Many ions  and some lettuce that tasted really gross and they slapped on 3 pickles and 2 chicken tenders they weren't even warm or even so what hot ordered a kids meal for my daughter came with 1 chicken tender what three year old is going to eat just one chicken tender. The chicken not very even good at all I choose canes 100% more than Popeyes. I'm sorry Popeyes but it just wasn't up to my expectations. I won't be going back"}
{"text":"Horrible visit.  The overriding bad thing was that  the drive-trough apparently has an alarm (that is well over 80 Decibels) that goes off if a car is in drive through longer than about 90 seconds...it went off for over TEN MINUTES of our visit, and manager said they can't do anything to silence it.  What a HORRIBLE way to punish your employees and customers!!!

Now, on to the visit...we drove 15.6 miles to this place, in a part of town I won't go without my gun...because Janet remembered Popeye's being great in her hometown.
Took them 5 minutes to take our order...there was a mini-rush and only 4 people working.  The entire 5 minutes to order and 10 to get our food was spent listening to the LOUD DRIVE THROUGH ALARM...which thankfully shut off as we sat down.

food took 10 min to get because they were \"waiting on biscuits.\"

price seemed a little cheaper than KFC
Staff (other than older red-shirted manager?) were courteous and friendly. Manager seemed indifferent.

Sides weren't as good as KFC. My nuggets were ok but puny, they look bigger in the sign photo's. Janet's chicken was on the cold side and not spicy like she ordered.....  Red beans and rice was actually CRUSTY the rice was so dry and it had been sitting so long.   It was luke warm and utterly flavorless (which is sad, because them HAVING red beans and rice was the only reason I agreed to go 15.6 miles vice the KFC nearby:(
Macaroni and cheese was, on the reverse side, NUCLEAR hot with a  dry crusty layer on top....Its flavor wasn't KFC rich, but it was runnier and not mushy like KFC,and I like that style better... .it seemed microwave-type HOT (you know, like when you forget and bite into a pop-tart that just got microwaved???)  But I know they didn't microwave it...
the bathroom showed extreme neglect including......{this is the point where you skip to the end if you don't want to read about bathrooms  in a restaurant review}   

Not a scrap of toilet paper anywhere...empty rolls in DOUBLE COMMERCIAL REEL type holder and ANOTHER empty roll on the ground.....guess this fried-chicken place goes through the inventory pretty quick...? Filthy floor, toilet, sink, etc.  badly in need of cleaning..I'll stop there."}
{"text":"We stopped by for chicken and shrimp.  The shrimp wasn't deveined.  Not a huge issue, but the big problem was that THE CHICKEN WAS RAW. It went straight into the trash.  I was excited when I saw them opening up, but it looks like I'll get my fix at KFC."}
{"text":"Went there a few days ago for lunch. I was greeted right away and informed of deals going on. Thomas was the friendliest person in customer service I've ever met. He was so helpful and definitely made the experience awesome. Good food and great service!"}
{"text":"I love Popeyes! My favorite fried chicken chain. This Popeyes specifically can be suuuuuuuper busy especially on a Tuesday (great deal). 

I love to order their spicy chicken family size buckets with Cajun rice. Their blacken ranch sauce is delicious. Crispy and juicy! Always returning for more  I often go here to bring some over to my parents place.. they really enjoy it as well."}
{"text":"I came in to purchase an 8-piece family meal and the person at the cash register said they did not have any chicken. I found it ridiculous that I could walk into a Popeyes mid-day & be told such foolish information. She even stated that it would take too long to make the chicken I requested, forcing me to go elsewhere to eat. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"The fries were good  I don't think they're healthy but they're good  but it smelled kind of weird but I just ordered, got my food and went to Starbucks"}
{"text":"Very good food but they didn't mark spicy or not I might not come back to this place don't come here they don't know how to mark spicy not spicy"}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru and the employee was very rude. He thought we couldn't hear him but the intercom was still on. The chicken was not very good either--felt a little queasy after eating it. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"The quality has gone WAY down. I gave 1 star but it should have been negative 3. The sides were only 3/4 full. There was very little shrimp in the popcorn shrimp and so over cooked it was like jerky. The only good thing was the biscuits. But no butter or honey was provided. They always used to give condiments and utensils. Really not worth the higher cost."}
{"text":"We have ordered lunch at this location 3 separate times for our office business meetings. Each time the staff and management were excellent, efficient and had our order accurate, packed ahead of schedule.   Its obvious that the manager of this store knows how to run a team and sets the right example."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad but the service was so bad I won't be back! I walked in there wasn't anyone in line but the guy at the register just looked at me waiting for me to order.  Then I had issues with my card. I used American expressed the day before today he said we don't take it what other card are you using besides that. Very rude. So I proceeded to use my MasterCard it was asking for a pin I explained there wasn't a pin it was a credit card. He shrugged his shoulders like he didn't care so the lady behind him told me to try swiping it again same thing, so I can tell this kid just wanted me out his line so I used my debit card ironically this time it didn't ask for a pin. So he handed my my receipt again no commend & proceeded to look at the next person for the order. Horrible service, and they say Americans are bad!"}
{"text":"Poor example of an experience I've had at Popeyes before. Besides the ridiculous prices, the food was not very good. Quite a wait, and the sweet tea was TERRIBLE.   The cashier however was very pleasant. Traveling for my sons birthday and he begged to go to Popeyes when we saw it in the airport. As the birthday boy, I let him have his way. Regret the decision and will not visit another airport Popeyes again."}
{"text":"Quite an improvement since my last few visits here. Always a warm welcome upon entering. Food was ready extra fast today. Will definitely be coming back soon. I hope the service and food stay excellent for years to come. #RhythmPopeyesAmbassador"}
{"text":"I always pass this location and it looks great on the outside - red bricks and all. We ordered takeout from here on a lazy night & got food poisoning. I called to let them know, but definitely won't risk it by eating here ever again."}
{"text":"Ordered two 5-piece tender combos and one extra biscuit. Got one 3-piece combo, one kids meal, and no extra biscuit... I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service! Long wait while in the drive thru. Was told by the cashier to wait \"a few seconds\" after I already waited 6mins. He asked me for my order but then proceeds to tell me, \"it'll take a second for your chicken\" I went OFF! Told him I had already been waiting on his slow behind and now he needs me to wait MORE!?!?!? No thanks Popeye's. This location shouldn't be open."}
{"text":"I came here on my lunch break 2/28. Used the drive-thru and was asked to pull ahead. Was not informed that my food would take longer or the meal my co-worker had ordered takes longer then normal. We sat in the parking lot for the greater part of 20mins before we called and asked what the deal was.  We were then informed that the food is taking a longer and that we would just have to wait a little longer ... i used my entire 30min break plus being 10mins late to get back work and no time to eat.... this could have been avoided if at the time of ordering they would have told us that the food takes 25min minutes to make... im pissed and have wasted my time for nothing... will never go back here"}
{"text":"The best Popeyes in the Phoenix area. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I have never had any food or service issues at this location. My advice to anyone with complaints is to ask for the Manager on duty or the Owner. The Owner is actively involved and does care about his customers and will make it right."}
{"text":"Well after a pretty good start when they first opened this place is now gone downhill. I was there for dinner this week around 5:30 and it was empty. Now I know why. The chicken tasted like it had been cooked 2 hours ago. As a long time Popeye's customer I am so disappointed. I will probably never return."}
{"text":"My husband loves Popeyes chicken I keep telling him that there are other places to get fried chicken but he insists we come here. This is the third time I've ordered and got the wrong things given to me and it's hard to check the entire bag holding up the drive-through. It seems that the people inside a more focused on their conversations then the customer orders and they forget condiments or items that were requested even when reminded that they were requested at the window. The chicken is always good that's A positive however your sides are always dry and seem to have been sitting for a while. I will be taking him to experience other chicken places so we don't have to keep going through this loss of money and poor experience."}
{"text":"We ate here today and were greeted at the door by a really friendly guy named Rhythm. He was awesome! Our order came out instantly and the staff was friendly. We got a 4 piece meal and the chicken was juicy, well cooked and just right. We got a free apple pie! I would for sure come back and would recommend this place over KFC any day."}
{"text":"The staff seemed dazed and confused. Louisiana Fast? No!!! we were told to pull around to the front and waited 15 minutes to get 75% of our order. The employees were rude. They acted as if 2 #7s with beans and rice was a unusual order. A #7 has 5 chicken strips we got 5 total for 2 orders. The Pop was warm with no ice at all. I like Popeye's normally but I won't go back to this location."}
{"text":"Tiny Chicken meet wrapped with thick flour--not enough quantity;-(
Service was minimal and staff did not smile or care to answer questions"}
{"text":"Many of the team members lack interest, are rude, and their replies are short. Many menu items are not available, and other items are not suggested. 
One example of our frustration with  this location is that when we asked for their advertised rasberry pies, we were told it would be 7 minutes.  We said that would be alright, to which the employee relied \"okay......, so you want to wait 7 minutes?!\" They were out of several of the things we wanted to order as well. 
The food tasted great, but this location really needs to work on their customer service skills.

Update- I have spoken with Amanda, the store Manager. She is very understanding, and seems to really want to rectify the customer service issues. Thus I have increased the rating and hope to see positive changes."}
{"text":"I made the unfortunate mistake of coming here at around noon. There's a couple of schools nearby so the line was to the door and the place was loud and full of swearing teenagers. Though the kids were ignorant of any sort of manners toward the staff I was amazed at the level of professionalism the staff maintained towards the customers.

I went with a chicken fingers order. Due to the large volume of people the cashier told me it would be a slight wait. No problem, there was lots going on to keep me entertained while I sipped on my Coke. Before I knew it they were calling my number and I was on my way."}
{"text":"The people are so friendly here. I guess I came on a good day! I got the ghost wings, delicious and piping hot! Also got the five piece chicken tenders delicious as well and fresh! My only concern was the coleslaw it was less than fresh, other than that everything else was spectacular."}
{"text":"Service at this location is the biggest joke. I live right around the corner from this location, and go out of my way to visit another location so I am sure my order is correct. I don't know if this is one of the so called \"training restaurants\" or what, but this location can't seem to get their crap together. I see reviews that state that we should see how bad other locations are, before we complain about service here....really? First,That sounds like a major internal issue with corporate, and second, why should I have to go to a different location when I would have to drive past this location to get there? Hopefully they can get their management issues under control. I really think they have a great product."}
{"text":"Watched Nip Tuck last night and Dr. Troy, in a moment of weakness, was scarfing down KFC...frankly if you are going to have a moment of weakness, take a flyer on KFC and go straight to a Popeyes. This one is pretty good. The manager/owner spends way too much time staring at the kids working here...kind of creepy/intimidating, but, two weeks ago, at a Tim Horton's in Waterford, a manager would have made the place much more orderly. The kids here certainly hop to it under his watchful eye, and the place is clean as a whistle."}
{"text":"Popeye's chicken is yummy. While I like to be a food snob at times, I also like my Popeye's. It is greasy, but good.  However, three stars might be generous considering my experiences here. Let's say two and a half.

The problems with this Popeye's (and this may be the case with others are)..

1. The place feels very sterile. It has no drive thru, so when you come in, you want to at least feel comfortable eating there. Not here.
2. The service can be very good, or very not good. Sometimes employees do not get orders right or listen carefully to what you say. On the last visit, while being refused an extra sauce (I did not have the 28 cents cash, see next point), I decided not to mention that they forgot the biscuit on my order.
3. There are petty up charges for everything, like a quarter plus tax for an extra sauce (one is not really enough) and 50 cents plus tax for a refill on a fountain drink that was already not cheap. If you have no cash, it is a frustrating use of a charge card. Good grief, just charge everyone a few cents more up front and give them all the sauces they want.  In most cases it will be two, not a hundred.
4. Everything that is not an extra charge is behind the counter. I'm sure it is a corporate policy, but to worry that the customers are going to bankrupt you by running off with too many napkins sends a negative signal. Maybe demographic research has shown that a typical Popeyes customer comes to the restaurant primarily to have straw popping fights or steal napkins to line their bird cage for a year. Not quite sure.
4. Again, the place feels like a franchise that someone in Los Angeles or New York owns who has never actually set foot in the place. The management does do an ok job, but you don't get the sense that anyone cares you ate here. At least Tim Horton's sometimes pretends like it."}
{"text":"Popeyes has good fried chicken. It is greasy, but kind of like most fried chicken is greasy. I am always surprised at the reviews that suggest this is (or should be) anything but the unhealthiest place to eat on earth. The chicken and the tenders are simply greasy goodness.

The problem here is that both Popeyes inc. and this location are a customer service train wreck.

There are extra charges for everything (sauces, refills, etc.) Good luck trying to get an extra napkin.

When they don't have what you've ordered prepared, you will wait and wait. Instead of offering an extra sauce or fry, they tell you to move because you are in the way of others trying to order."}
{"text":"I can't believe I ate chicken from this place. You could tell the employees hated their jobs. The worst customer service."}
{"text":"The chicken crisp fell apart when you took a bite. On the other hand it tasted pretty good. The sodas had refills. The staff was kind. They had many chicken choices. And worst of all it was super dirty."}
{"text":"This chicken is worse than dog poop I literally can't eat it if I was starving to death. A fly wouldn't even land on anything coming from here"}
{"text":"I do not know why the reviews here are so bad.  The chicken was great.  Please go to the Popeyes in Los Angeles and all before you complain about this food.  If I compare this Popeyes to what I have experienced in the Midwest, this one is like those and when I come here I want an AT HOME vibe.  I got that here.  The biscuits were soft like they should be.  The ones in Los Angeles compared to these were hard and did not have this grand presentation.  The chicken is hot and juicy and it is 9:32PM.  I did not fee rushed or like an inconvenience.  I will be back."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. $6.00 for a 2 piece combo that was a dry as the desert. 
Take a bite take a drink, take a bite take a drink...so sad. Was so looking forward to a good piece of chicken. 
The bisket and dirty rice was the only saving grace
The service was fast and ask they handed me my to go box getting in the car thinking CHECK THE BOX. .if you get to go please put some utensils in the box.
That was the first strike I hope I don't have a strike 2"}
{"text":"Upset! I went through drive thru... They don't do separate orders. Fine. I tried to add on to the order when I got to the window. She said no you have to go back around there are other cars. Wtf! I tried to call her back and she never came. Then she had an attitude. I will never come back to this location because of the drive through associate. I ended up parking and walking in. The lady at the front was great."}
{"text":"I visited this Popeyes location on 10/20/16 at approximately 10 pm. I have been to Popeyes a zillion times over my lifetime. Seriously, countless times. It is sad to say that I have drastically lowered my expectations with fast food chains. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food and service at this location. The staff was friendly without attitude and the chicken was hot and fresh. If you're looking for a quick bite to while on the strip, please check out Popeyes."}
{"text":"This Popeye's is a brand new location! So everything is nice and clean! Unfortunately, the service was mediocre, it took someone a while to finally take my order and the register the cashier used looked as if the receipt paper had run out, so it took a little while to finally get my receipt. But before I finished fixing my drink the food was ready to pick up! Now, that was fast and let's all praise the lawd, because a sista' was hungry! And I love some Popeye's Spicy Chicken.  I ordered the two piece spicy fried chicken, side of french fries and one delicious biscuit. Those biscuits are the devil, its like you can't just have one. And that's exactly one I ordered an extra one smh. Trust me, you have to try those biscuits!!! They are the best biscuits at a fast food restaurant! The chicken wasn't fried to my liking (it could have been fried a little longer) but it was still good. I will be back and tell others to try out this location, especially since it is new!"}
{"text":"Clean and fast service. Good food at good prices"}
{"text":"Initially I would have given this joint 5 stars due to the incredible service we received on our first time in. A lovely girl named Victoria helped us figure out just what we wanted and even brought our food out to us and asked us later how everything was, we were very stunned by her service. 

The next time we came back and every time after was not as good. When going through drive through it seems like they always forget something and when going inside the service just doesn't exist. The food is ALWAYS good. In fact its my husbands favorite chicken joint. He's in love with the blackened ranch sauce and I prefer the mardi gras mustard. It's superb. Bump up the service a little and this place will be perfect."}
{"text":"I went through the drive through and ordered a meal deal for a quick family dinner. We barely eat out so I was very specific on what we wanted just to get a balanced fast food experience. When I arrived home I saw that my order was completely incorrect. They forgot sides that I ordered (specifically for myself considering I didn't want the chicken), they have is the wrong sides that we did order, only half the biscuits, and a tub full of very small wing pieces.  I was very disappointed but didn't want to drive all of the way back. I fed my family and made more food at home (even though I ordered take out to not have to cook), and I even emailed them to inform them of their mistake. So far no one has contacted me. Therefore I am writing this review. Will never go back, especially considering that I gave them a chance to rectify the situation by emailing."}
{"text":"Chicken were anorexic compared to other Popeye's. Mashed potatoes were soupy. Cashier was not friendly. Worst location ever. Should have just gone to kfc."}
{"text":"I've lived in Charlotte since April 2011. I've been waiting for this day! As a man that was born and raised in Brooklyn, Popeyes was a staple for me growing up!
NO more wack BoJangles undercooked chicken and horrible biscuits! Even though I had to drive all the way to the West side to eat, it was well worth it! I LOVE POPEYES!

Wooohooo! We got a Popeyes...yeah, yeah, yeah!"}
{"text":"HORRENDOUS SERVICE. I always order from this location because it's the closest to my home. Delivery usually takes about 45 minutes, but the last time I ordered, it took OVER AN HOUR. When we called to complain, they said \"they were busy.\" And my house is a 10 minute drive from the Popeyes location. I don't think it takes an hour to drive five minutes. They did not compensate is in any way. So we stopped ordering for a while, and today I called 12-15 times to place an order. Did they answer? No. 12-15 times! No answer! Not from my home phone or my cell phone. Moreover, they always give us bad pieces of chicken, no flavour, no juice. 
Horrendous location, horrendous staff and service. If you're really craving Popeyes, there's one at Finch. Do yourself a favour and go there instead. That's what we're going to do from now on. Never ordering from this location anymore."}
{"text":"I have no idea why the place has received so many bad reviews, but I've been a loyal customer for this location for almost 3 years, and they consistently provide high quality deep fried chicken -- well-seasoned, crispy, tender, juicy, and, most importantly, not greasy!

I would definitely say that this location is probably the best Popeyes in the downtown area."}
{"text":"No stars!!!! Worst Popeyes in Las Vegas. No type of customer service. Employees sucks! I ordered my food and I was told the wait time was 15 minute. I was fine with that. 20 minutes later, I had to asked for my order and was told I had to wait for another 10 minute. Nope!!! Give me back my money. I will not be coming back to this location. This is not the first!"}
{"text":"Brandon working drive thru 9/29 was the friendliest guy and by far the best customer service I've experienced here."}
{"text":"Wow, the worst ever. Chicken was old, close slaw tasted like some dam bullshit, straight mayo and plastic tasting. Did I mention the chicken was old and now an upset stomach, JERKS."}
{"text":"Well, this die-hard Bojangles fan might just become a Popeye's girl. The chicken was flavorful and crispy, the fries were seasoned perfectly. The biscuit might be the only thing that Bojangles has them beat on, but even that wasn't bad. The drive-through employees were friendly and full of personality. I was really excited to try their dipping sauces, but they weren't offered and I forgot to ask. Oh well, just another reason to go back! I only wish it were closer.

I do wish this location was easier to get into though- that lane that looks like an entrance? Yeah, it's an exit-only lane. And that other lane that looks like you can get in that way? Yeah, no, you can't. I had to go out onto South Boulevard and back in twice before I found the entrance."}
{"text":"Tonight was the third time i have ordered food to be told they were either out of bread or lettuce. It was bread again this time. Also, at least every other time the person prepping the order can not count out the correct number of chicken pieces ordered or they simply leave out portions of your order. If that all wasn't enough this location has one of the slowest drive-thru lines i have ever been to.  You have been warned."}
{"text":"I love Popeyes but the service at this location is very inconsistent. The chicken was overdone this time"}
{"text":"THIS place should be closed down asap,got chicken and it was dry as can be,must have been sitting there for many hours, dont bother going to this place,they dont care about thier chicken!! its the worst of the worst!!"}
{"text":"I saw the Employees were not wearing gloves while prepping my food through the drive thru. Couple hours later and I'm puking my guts out. FOOD POISONING at its finest. First time I threw up without alcohol involved in over 10 years. I'm still sick and now I have to miss work tonite. And they took forever"}
{"text":"Seems to be a newer location, but they do have a dinning room host that is a welcome change for fast food. Melanie was a great host, interacting with people, making herself available, and helping with what seemed to be a very busy lunch hour. Kudos."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went in today for lunch. We ordered something that was about 18 dollars and my husband asked for some sauce. Manager said it is going to be $5 for sauce. ARE YOU KIDDING? We paid for $18 worth of food and you can't get us some sauce with no charge? there was no ketchup either! What kind of customer service is that? Plus, dining room was very messy, I looked other customers had to clean their tables before they seat. I saw a woman who got so mad that she just walked out the door without filling her to-go drink. Probably same thing that I was unpleasant about like our experience. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. REHIRE THE MANAGER!!"}
{"text":"The worst Popeyes on the planet. I waited over 30 mins in the drive thru for my order. The customer service is very poor and they have no respect for people's time nor do they no how to run a business"}
{"text":"Very very poor customer service.
Chicken is good
I would prefer this over kfc. 
I would only return of the chicken but not the service
Maybe try the hwy7 and mccowen location"}
{"text":"Only good thing was their customer greeter at the front door. Ordered cajun fish and inly got one. Went to drive through i said i had a question. Took 5 min to reply. I got t fixed i said ty. And the guy said nothing and looked grumpy. Don't go here."}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout from this place many times. It's always delicious and fresh food. The service has been consistently friendly and prompt. I wouldn't hesitate to return!"}
{"text":"I was initially so happy that Popeyes came to South Charlotte.  Popeyes brings back good memories from my childhood in Mississippi. However, THIS PARTICULAR Popeyes is a tremendous disappointment. I have visited this location many times and each time I'm confronted with attitude from the workers and there's ALWAYS something missing from my order. I just visited recently and instead of red beans and rice and Cajun rice I was given greasy French fries. This even after I was asked if I wanted fries and I clearly and specifically stated I did not. When I got all the way back home and discovered that they completely screwed up my order, I was treated with indifference by Darwin the manager. He magnanimously offered to give me what I had already paid for if I drove the hour back to them (thirty minutes each way). He was not at all concerned about my inconvenience and never offered any other fix than replacing the food once I drove back."}
{"text":"I came in wanting to use the coupon I got from a previous visit during the day. The manger looked at the cashier, told him in Spanish \"she didn't like that black girl\" then walked off. Now, I've not ever seen this woman a day in my life. I then asked the young man why she didn't like me in Spanish, and then told him I'm not black or mixed, I'm Hispanic and understood EVERY word. He got  apologetic and proceeded with my order. I waited a long time for it to come and didn't get my two piece chicken meal. I went back to the counter and asked for them to please give it to me, she rolled her eyes and told him to hurry and get me from the desk again in Spanish. I then got her attention and in Spanish educated her that she shouldn't be talking about ANYONE because she doesn't know who understands her and who doesn't. I told her she was a poor example of leadership and I wouldn't ever visit this location again. P.S. the food is GREAT"}
{"text":"This place is horrible.  The staff is NOT friendly and acted life we were really putting them out by ordering.  When we got to the window, we were not greeted, no smile, only a frown.  I really felt that my business was not wanted at ALL.  My son wanted this and it will be the LAST time that I take him here."}
{"text":"I hate to give a bad review but this is one of the worst Popeyes I've been too. I ordered my food, and they told me to pull up because it would take a few minutes. I had no issues with this at all. 20 min later they bring me a bag full of food, they gave me extras for the wait. When I get home, I realize they gave me all of this food, and none of it was anything I ordered. Waited 20 min for a bunch of food I didn't want. What makes this even worse, a lady that worked here came out to my car and asked me what I ordered!!! And still got it wrong!!"}
{"text":"Second visit after they said I couldn't  make 2 separate orders when they were dead the first time. Second visit chicken was dry, they messed up my simple order. Place was extremely filthy. Had to wipe down our own table. Wish this place was cleaner and more attentive staff since we work down the street. Guess next time we just go back to Canes down the street."}
{"text":"I love the chicken here but this staff is out of control. This management needs restructuring. To the gentleman that took my order thank you for being amazing for the other gentleman that called out my number 4 times... try having the food ready instead of calling the number out several times while you are still preparing it. For the young staff its not ok to say dont bother me I'm going to go count something while turning your back to a counter full of people needing something simple. SMH its always a circus act in here."}
{"text":"I was standing there for 10 minutes and nobody ever took my order. All the employees behind the counter, including the manager saw me and didn't even acknowledge me. As I was walking out I said I'd take my business some place else and didn't  even try to stop me, the manager sarcastically yelled \"thanks!!\" Worst customer service experience ever!!"}
{"text":"A great fan of Popeyes crunchy spicy fried chicken,  today was my second visit to this location and I was disappointed again. I doubt I will ever visit this Popeyes location again. 

My reviews on Yelp would confirm my spicy palate.  The chicken served here is bland, it is missing the Popeyes zing. Today's meal was also under seasoned.  

The first time I visited this location, I thought they accidentally gave me regular chicken instead of spicy, but the manager confirmed that this was from the spicy chicken batch just removed from the frier.  Same story today. 

I love Popeyes chicken and eat it regularly at various locations.  Somehow, the taste of the chicken is not right at this particular restaurant.  

If someone from the franchise development team is reading this,  I request you to please investigate this matter.  The chicken was hot and fresh, but it was missing the signature Popeyes spicy chicken taste I am accustomed to."}
{"text":"The antithesis of fast food. Spent 20 minutes in a drive thru line only 4 cars long. Spent another 10 minutes waiting at the window for my extremely complicated order of chicken tenders and a side of mac, only to be told to drive around to the front because it was going to take longer. Another 10 minutes spent squatting in parking lot purgatory with the other poor souls whose stomachs were undoubtedly grumbling loudly like mine. And when my food finally comes out?? Not even a simple thanks or apology for the excruciating and completely avoidable 40+ minute wait. I was thrilled when I first found out popeyes was opening in my neighborhood, but this will be the second and last time I go there. Serves me right for straying away from Raising Canes and Chick-fil-a. This place is goin down the crapper faster than my tenders will in the morning."}
{"text":"So I rarely go here, but every once in awhile I get a craving. I like the batter on the chicken (thick and crunchy) and you get a choice of spicy or mild (beware, the spicy is just that). I like having options for side dishes (cajun rice w beans - okay, but not terribly flavourful, biscuits - bland and doughy, their fries are usually tasty, coleslaw is pretty good - it's with a mayo dressing though, not vinegar). I also had the popcorn shrimp, but they were kind of blah. Frankly my preference would have been to have them grilled, not deep fried. My combo came with a large piece of chicken, a side dish, a biscuit and a drink. I did burn my mouth with the hot oil that burst out between the skin of the chicken and the meat (the chicken wasn't that hot to the touch, either). That's never happened before, but I worry about a child biting into the chicken and having it happen. Having said all of that, it's a fast food place, and you can have an artery clogging meal for $10 or less. I'd give this 2.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Never went into popeyes at this location,  I've only stopped to get gas until last night. Great young lady at the cashier counter, very helpful not only to me but when a customer had to come back and return a messed up order she didn't question the lady she just fixed the problem and it only took 2 seconds to do so. The lady was happy and the cashier always had a smile on her face. Super polite and patient cashier, I give her a 5 star for handling customers with awesome customer service skills. Plus, she was quick with my order and she knew that I was in a hurry. 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever! Ordered 11 piece got 8 ordered NOT spices got SPICEY. Don't go to this location if you want to get your order correct. This is attached to a circle K that I stopped and got a drink yesterday, I watched a person come in the Popeyes door mad that he went through the drive thru and didn't get his order right so not just a once in awhile occurrence. I want to not give a star but have to since they owe me money for chicken I didn't get and wrong kind to boot!"}
{"text":"Wow I wish I could give this place 0 stars! The chicken was COLD! Not warm, not hot but barely edible  I ate it only because we were in a hurry and I didnt have time to turn around or eat anywhere else. I couldnt even eat the whole thing. I immediately got sick and am still sick. Its also very overpriced for what you get! I wasnt expecting a 5 star meal but now I am missing work bc of the food they serve here. Please avoid this place and dont end up like me.

*update*

Manager did give me my money back however the whole attitude of alll the staff that works there is so rude unprofessional unaccomdating and not sympathetic at all! Not even one \"Im sorry\""}
{"text":"On the way home the twins wanted something to eat so , of course I asked what they wanted? This was the answer, and the first time I've ever had Popeyes. It was not bad, the potatoes are excellent and so are there fries. The biscuits that we ordered were fresh, (lucky us); and were so soft with honey baked into it.

We opted for the drive thru which wraps around a convenient store thru the back of the building which was cute and quaint. The speaker and cashier were loud and took our order and fulfilled it without any drama. I needed something to wash the chicken down so we parked and ventured in their store is very welcoming and bright. The cashier was very friendly and had something and out him, Chris was his name so friendly and bright. Their lobby was clean and tidy so all around great little chicken joint."}
{"text":"Just as good as the one that I used to frequently go to when I lived in the DMV. I ordered The 3 piece wings with red beans and rice with a biscuit, a side of onion rings, sweet potatoe pie, and a apple pie for later. The chicken was hot, crunchy, and tasty. The red beans and rice were warm and good. The onion rings were hot, they are only made when you order them. They biscuit was warm, moist and good. Nice Staff too!"}
{"text":"Would give a zero if I could. Stale, overpriced chicken. $18 for the equivalent of a quarter of a chickens worth of meat. Lesson learned...never again."}
{"text":"This is the slowest Popeyes. The wait was too long. People were standing around talking instead of working. Never again will I go to that location again."}
{"text":"Very clean place!  Mary is extremely sweet and provides amazing customer service!!!!!  Thank you Mary!  If your in the area it's a good, fast service place for a meal!"}
{"text":"The manager, M. Islam ran out of cups.  All he had left was 32oz Styrofoam.  While I saw him give away these cups to four other patrons, he CHARGES me!  When all I wanted was a small.  Unbelievable.  It's not the charge I even care about, it's how sneakily he charges me, while handing out cups to everyone else.  He was quite rude, and had no customer service skills at all, and was talking to other team members while taking my order.   I have been frequenting this Popeyes a lot lately, I need some kind of gesture my service is cared about to return.  They also had no ranch in stock for my chicken tenders and the Blackberry/Cream Cheese pie I ordered was a hollow shell with no cream cheese and barely any blackberry.   I actually saw other customers complaining about screwed up orders and about the cup situation too. The manager then leaves the counter, and next thing I see is him elbow deep in the dishes leaving his employees to handle the complaints.   Worst visit to a Popeyes bar none!"}
{"text":"Service sucks every time. Orders are always wrong. They don't give a fuck either! Only reason they got 1 star is because i had to select one to got forward"}
{"text":"I always buy the chicken sandwich combo with fries and a drink. It's always fulfilling. A few times I tried to order other things but it's always been a disappointment. Stick with the chicken sandwich combo. Not the most courteous of staff. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"If I could give them a zero I would - DO NOT ever go to the Popeyes on Lake Mead in LV - it could have not been a more terrible experience"}
{"text":"For some reason I never get a chance to eat before my flight home.   Thank goodness for Popeye's chicken inside the airport.  The food is always fresh and tasty.   The price is high as I don't know what..however so is everything else at the airport!"}
{"text":"Came in for a Tuesday special.  They don't have a Tuesday special at this location.  I was really disappointed.  The staff was nice though so I gave them an extra star for that."}
{"text":"Fresh chicken.  Clean location.  Fast service.  They honor the Tuesday special.  Not all locations do."}
{"text":"I'm a church's chicken when it come to fried chicken. Was in the area and though why not try it. Food was not bad. However the person at drive thru did forget my sauce and she was very rude."}
{"text":"The best Popeyes at an airport in the country!!  Lightening fast service with a smile almost everytime. Always ready for you no matter what time you arrive! I love it when my connection is thru Vegas!! I have eaten here dozens of times. Great management."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times over multi month period. Food is good, prices are fair, but the wait time can be incredibly long. I waited over 40 minutes during my last visit."}
{"text":"Always get the receipt so you can do the survey so you can get free 1 piece chicken and biscuit with purchase of medium pop !

Overall the service has been pretty consistent here, they're efficient in getting the food out quite fast even right before closing time. Chicken is always hot and fresh and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Stop at Popeyes on Dysart in Glendale. I have eaten here several times. It's usually good but not as good as the Popeye on thunderbird/83rd ave. Now back to Popeyes on dysart. It starts with walking in and restaurant is warmer inside than outside in july. Ordering process goes well. On to the bad part. We get our cups head over to drink machine and no ice in machine and no tea in the container. We go back to counter to get sweet tea and when we got the tea it was bitter and not very sweet. My wife and I really like there tea except this time. Now onto the food. I ordered the popcorn shrimp and they where over cooked to the point where the breading was a dark brown. The shrimp inside was like rubber. The biscuits where very dry and did not taste good. Will not be going back to this Popeyes."}
{"text":"One year ago i would eat here 2 - 3 times a week. I decided to stop in on Oct. 12th 2016.
I don't know what changed in the last year but the service is not good and the shrimp meal i recieved was pathetic. I got 10 popcorn shrimp. Will not eat here again."}
{"text":"i have been there three times and never again. first two times the wait for spicy strips was more than five minutes. last  i got a food borne illness from the strips. i know it was the strips because i only eat once a day and that was it."}
{"text":"They forgot our sauces, and I wouldn't mind if it had just happened to us, but I've heard from other people that they forget things in their orders."}
{"text":"This employee had the drive thru line backed up cause she was outside talking to a guy then decided to go back in & as I'm at the window waiting she comes to the window to re-ask me what I ordered. Then the guy she was outside talking to walks up to the window in between my car & she gives him free drinks!!! While the drive thru was backed out she was being beyond unprofessional & basically stealing company products giving them to I'm guessing her boyfriend for free!! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER"}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of Popeyes and the first time in this location. It was nicely decorated and filled with people. Despite the long line up, the service was fast and had a good assembly line up.

The menu orders are still a little overprice, just like any food chains. Wish they make it affordable. But the quality of chicken are still bigger and tastier than most chicken place. The biscuit and gravy is a great side order and goes well with the crispy chicken.

The next time I'm here, we will try the fries and possibly the shrimp popcorn. It looked really tasty from the window advertisement and seemed like a must taste kinda thing.

If anyone wants a quick chicken, this a place to go. It's not a dine and date but take the chicken and put it in a basket. You've got the perfect picnic meal. But don't forget the biscuit :)"}
{"text":"One Star bc zero isn't an option. Someone shoot this place and put everyone out of their misery. Food is NOT Popeyes standard. The employees are seriously the worst. I'm pretty sure she just rushed us through the drive-thru so we wouldn't catch her giving us 6 wings in a 10 piece special. After telling us we could not have all dark. When that is a thing!! The worst."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Popeyes, the first was a good experience. This visit, however wasn't so good. I ordered the Shrimp Tackle Box, which is advertised to have 8 Butterfly Shrimp. What I got was a dozen or so Shrimp Bits, that were mostly breading and had absolutely no flavor. 

The biscuit was uncooked dough in the middle, threw that away. 

The fries were good, the only thing that was good. 

I know this is fast food, but c'mon, sell what you advertise.

I took a photo and wish I could upload it here."}
{"text":"even after seeing all the bad reviews I decided to try this Popeyes. TERRIBLE! I ordered a family meal of chicken only and spicy and the chicken was no where near spicy :( the service was terrible he cut me off while in the drive through, very disappointing for one of my favorite food chains"}
{"text":"When you need greasy (in a good way), spicy (in a great way), fattening (ok.... two out of three ain't bad) fried chicken this is where to go. The biscuits are good and the sides are too."}
{"text":"This just wasn't my thing.  I thought it was overpriced, didn't really like the chicken, fish or shrimp. The service was super slow. I don't know, I usually give pretty good reviews, but I have no desire to return to Popeyes."}
{"text":"Since they moved from across the street the management seem to have changed and sucked. Been here three times since and all three a big disappointment.  Very poor service and never chicken ready. The manager had yo tell cook to drop thighs three or more times. Way too much playing around."}
{"text":"This shit is awful. I feel bad that this company represents Louisiana in any culinary form. 

The employees at this particular location must be part of the $15/hr  movement. 

Someone needs to teach the counter people to keep their goddamn fingers out of the inside of the cups.

Also, learn to fucking count. 3 is not 2, even in ass-backwards Arizona."}
{"text":"I have to say that the staff here are very nice and friendly. Props to the owner to make it a great working environment for the staff."}
{"text":"Love the $0.99 two piece leg and thigh special on Tuesdays. I've been going here for several weeks now and I haven't had any service or food quality issues. In fact, I've even gotten extra pieces sometimes.

Go here on Tuesdays and get yourself a bunch of cheap fried chicken. Not much else to say."}
{"text":"I wish I couldn't give any stars at all! I have going to this new location 4 times and 4 times they have messed up my order. I sent a email to their corporate office and I have still not received a response. I told them they need to either train their employees better and/or hire people who know how to follow simple directions.How stupid can you be to mess up something as simple as a number #3 with a Coke. I guess I'm the stupid one because I keep going there hoping that they will one day give me exactly what I ordered."}
{"text":"OK, We read and write reviews for good reasons but if  only I would have listened to them before I went there tonight, could I have saved myself some money and grief. I gave in to my daughter who \"needed biscuits\"  and bought food at Popeye's. The place was filthy which I would have normally turned around and walked out but since I promised her food, I decided to go ahead and try it. The guy goofing around behind the counter took a good 5 minutes before he took my order, He said something slurred under his breath and I asked \"Oh, are you ready to   take my order?\" , He just nodded. He seemed to be more interested in what the others in the back were talking and laughing about... Very unproffesional and his hair was unkept and dirty and too long IMO not to be in a cap. So I order, get my food home and it was bad. OK, The biscuits were fair as was the micro size of beans and rice but my daughters mac n cheese was so dry and unedible as was the chicken tenders.. using the word loosely here. They seemed like they had been sitting around for days. They were so cold and dry and were more like chicken jerky... Glad I bought a few extra biscuits.... NEVER AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"The employees just horses around in the back. A group of underage kids come in the restaurant and just take up seats and play around. I have been to others and they are nothing close to this."}
{"text":"I went to this Popeyes about 3 weeks ago around 9:30 pm. Went to the drive thru. When I got to the kiosk to order, a young lady asked me to wait. I said no problem. No exaggeration, 10 minutes went by. I finally said hello?? And was asked to wait one more minute. I finally placed my order. 4 meals with 4 drinks. I had to repeat it a couple of times but that didn't bother me. When I drove up to the window to pay, I was handed 3 drinks. She took my payment and I told her I should have 4 drinks. I noticed my food in a bag sitting next to the register. The A/C was blowing the bag. When I asked her for the 4th drink, she picked up my receipt, looked at me and said. \"This is to much\" and she walked away WITHOUT giving me the food. I was shocked. I wasn't rude at all I just simply said \" shouldn't I have 4 drinks?\"  She NEVER came back. Another employee walked by, looked at the food, smiled and kept walking. I couldn't believe it. I waited a few more minutes (6 total) and no one came to give us our food. My husband got out of the car and brought the drinks inside and spoke to a manager. The manager said \" what do you want me to do?\" My husband, not to happy now, said he wanted a refund. The manager started the refund and in he middle walked away to take a customers order. In the mean time, 2 other cars at the drive thru drove off without paying and without their food too! We finally got our refund and I took the survey in the receipt. I was honest and when asked if I wanted to be contacted I said yes to explain it in more detail. Still haven't heard from them. I will NEVER go to his Popeyes again. It's a shame because it's brand new and we were excited to see it so close to home. Anyway. Wanted to make sure my review was seen and used as a training tool. That Popeyes needs to retrain it's employees and managers. Horrible!"}
{"text":"Matthew took our order, he greeted us as we walked in and had a smile on his face. I haven't been to a Popeyes in a very long time. I tried the maple flavored chicken with BBQ sauce. Was very good :) :)"}
{"text":"Good chicken and shrimp. We did go right around closing so I can't complain. Food was hot and fresh. The $5 shrimp box was great, strips are always good. Restaurant itself seemed dirty but it was close to closing and the employees seemed to be getting ready to clean up. I'd recommend it if your in a hurry or just craving some quick fried goodness."}
{"text":"They got both my meal and my wife's meal wrong the first time weighted then when they brought it back out mine was right my wife's was wrong again we waited my chicken was totally overcooked and my wife's chicken was on the burnt side after the weight we were completely discouraged and just said we will never come back here again the service was extremely poor and they acted like they didn't know their own menu while I was ordering I literally had to coach the order-taker through the whole thing it was horrible no wonder is wrong butt then the manager took over and couldn't even get it right what a total mess the store is in like I said we will not return it's horrible tables and chairs were dirty as well I do not recommend anybody going in there unless they want to get sick"}
{"text":"First time at the Flamingo/Decatur Popeyes. I went into the store to order. Ordered Mac n Cheese as a side. They don't have any. The cashier tells me nobody in Vegas has it. Well it's on their website! The mashed are too spicy and the biscuits taste salty. Not planning on going back ever again."}
{"text":"Avoid please avoid this Popeyes !! I tried it 5 times now and the chicken is always cold due to bad management and slow business because the location sucks. The chicken tenders are not tender strips they are small 3- 4  inches in size  nuggets. I called the manager after opening the box of so called tenders that I bought at the drive thru, never again will I give them a penny of my money for dried up so called 3- 4 inch tenders that the manager Kamani would not even correct THE ISSUE. KAMANI THE MANAGER  is a very RUDE HELPLESS  manager with No customer service skills at all.AVOID this Popeyes at all cost . Plus the cajun rice is not Popeyes quality always different tasting never can get it the seasoning  right taste burnt, They serve cold biscuits  that is not right to charge  high dollars for this gross fast food."}
{"text":"Courtney and Marielle are ridiculously awesome! First, shout out to the Las Vegas airport for having a Popeyes! I used to live in Atlanta, and that's one of THE BEST parts of flying via Atlanta (aside from my friend Dawn's Flat Out of Heels rollable ballet flat shoes vending machine- it's in concourse E ladies- thank me later ). I LOVE POPEYES! Wish I was Beyonce and was able to get a \"free Popeyes for life card\" (that's the word in the blogosphere). Any who, until then, if suggest coming to this very Popeyes! I've lived  in 4 cities, and no (please excuse my language- my taste buds are currently salivating and my taste buds are jumping for joy), but NO BULLSHIT, this is the best freaking chicken I've ever had from a Popeyes. Both Marielle and Courtney made this possible. I eat healthy, but when I go hard, I go hard- so I asked for the chicken with the most skin ( don't judge lol). I WILL BE BACK GUYS! They are also super patient very helpful and able to get every single thing right including sides condiments and wet naps #WINNING"}
{"text":"This place has been opened and closed many times over the past year.  My cousin and I went inside to order two 3 piece meals it took 25 mins for us to get our food. The manager asked for out receipt to confirm what we ordered but said nothing else. No one told us to expect a wait until the cook came out and said something. The restaurant did not acknowledge how long we waited. Always a bad experience here."}
{"text":"I am from the East coast and have loved Popeyes since I was a kid (It was are Friday night tradition growing up) but this location is horrible. I have tried it on a few occasions hoping it would get better (a girl can dream), but it hasn't. Not only has the chicken been dried out or shriveled up, but the sides don't have much flavor or they give you 8 fries (no joke, look at the picture). The service is no better, they are not out right rude but there is an attitude of not caring which is just as bad, and they have trouble getting my order right every time. The first time I had to drive back after realizing they gave me tenders instead of chicken (receipt clearly said chicken) and they forgot one of our sides. The last time I checked while pulling away and they had forgotten one of our sides again, so I turned around and went back. What a waste of time, just like this location, the order they gave us was pitiful. I am sad to say I will not return!"}
{"text":"I hardly ever review fast food restaurants, in fact I think if I'm not mistaken this is my first fast food restaurant. I have never had Popeyes so I thought I'd try and boy I was happy I did. Got the spicy chicken po'boy and I was a happy boy. 

Service was what is expected from a fast food chain. Average, robotic and in general everyone was respectful. Now I don't know how fast it is here but surely it wasn't fast food. It took them time and I was okay with that as I was not in a hurry. My po'boy sandwich came out with 2 strips of chicken, I opted to get the Mardi Gras mustard as a side dip, and mashed potatoes. The sandwich was confusing. While the chicken was delicious and crispy on the outside and spicy juicy from the inside, the bread was very elasticity (again I went in with the lowest expectations). The mashed potatoes with each however was HEAVENLY. In conclusion, I know I'll go back there but plan to wait for food as i think they cook to order."}
{"text":"Don't know what it is about this particular Popeye's but I have been three times since they opened. And the staff has always been really good. The food however is subpar compared to there other restaurants. Today our food was shriveled like it had been sitting there for days. The only reason this place gets a two star is because of the staff and it was clean. But the food not so much. Will not go back."}
{"text":"I enjoy good fried chicken once in a while and I was in the neighborhood and saw this Popeye's.  I ordered the 3 pcs mix meal with side of red beans & rice,  drink and a cinnamon pie.  The chicken was hot but the breast was overcooked and dry so I exchanged it for another thigh. I prefer dark meat BC it's usually more tender. The cinnamon pie was tasty due to it's DEEP FRIED! After my meal I felt a little nauseated due to the heaviness of the food - but it was worth it!

The service here was friendly and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Awww, my favorite fried chicken place EVER.  I love the food and always will, especially since I grew up in New Orleans, so it is in my DNA.  The service is ok, the restaurant is ok, and the speed is ok.  All of the OKs are why  gave it a 4 instead of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Trying the beer can Rippin chicken. You get chicken, a side and a biscuit for $3.99 ! Can't beat the price and the chicken is fantastic .. On our first trip here I had the catfish .. It was disappointing at best . So glad I gave it a 2nd chance chance because the chicken is fantastic and the mashed potatoes and gravy are the prefect side ."}
{"text":"I'm just so torn on if I really like Popeye's Chicken or not. I do like their biscuits and their Bold BBQ Sauce is pretty great. The chicken stips are good took. They are always super crunchy and thats nice. I like the idea of the sides they offer like red beans and rice or jambalaya but it is the idea I like only. Not so much the execution. The red beans and rice I got tonight was perhaps lacking in beans. There was rice and what was most like refried beans, sort of saucey and thick. I only found a few whole beans. Overall, the food is not bad its just not that great either. And service can be hit and miss. The lady who took my order had a pleasent demeaner but the lady who called out when my order was ready did not. She asked me what kind of sauce I wanted. I asked what my options were and she told me in a rude kind if way that they were listed on the menu. Fine, I didn't read that part of the menu but good customer service dictates that she should have answered my question rather than get snarky and basically tell to figure it out."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile. I had a coupon for buy a 3 piece dinner, get a 2 piece dinner free.  And it was really good!! The chicken was crunchy outside & juicy on the inside. The sides were yummy too! Will def try to go more often. =)"}
{"text":"These mexicans shady as hell. I ordered an 8 piece spicy, they put two spicy pieces on top, the rest white meat. Maybe if i was white they wouldve gotten my order right, you know who theyre master is."}
{"text":"There are thousands of dining options in LV. When you end up at a Popeyes, you know something has run amok.  
Yelp check in offer if the cashier can figure out how to process it .  
Cheap place to grab a snack. 
Chicken and fries were pretty fresh. 
Not the worst Popeyes I've been to."}
{"text":"Really tasty chicken and biscuits! I love their seasonings. Plus the different sauce options are fantastic. I love them all. I probably should eat here more often! Service is always friendly and quickish. They have a drivethru too. Who doesn't love chicken fast? Come try them you'll love it!"}
{"text":"First off this place definitely is not $$$ as it states it is. But then again I only dine here on a Tuesday as that's when they have the Popeye's Special: $1 for a leg and breast. Can't beat that so I usually order $5 worth. Who can beat 10 pieces of chicken for $5!!!! Greasy-you bet it is; why would anyone expect anything different. 

I used to frequent this place about 7 years ago, the one by Sahara and Jones I believe, but back then I think it was to soak up all the liquor consumed or cure the next day's hangover. Nevertheless, I still will frequent Pope-Yes as I like to call this joint. I feel it's better than KFC."}
{"text":"I've been to this location probably about 5 times in total. All of my previous experiences have been good. A majority of my visits have just been through the drive-thru. After receiving a coupon in the mail, I decided it was best to go inside to use my coupon. The cashier had no idea how to ring up my coupon so I had to wait for the manager to assist. This part I didn't mind because I know coupon usage at fast food restaurants isn't very common. I ordered an Oreo pie and of course they were sold out. Again, this isn't the part that bothered me. I got my food in a timely manner and when I got home, my side of macaroni and cheese was a joke. The container wasn't even 1/4 of the way filled up! I was so angry I almost called the restaurant to tell them but decided to just let it go. Needless to say, make sure you check your entire order (inside containers included) to ensure it is correct."}
{"text":"I've gone twice and they messed up my order both times. This last time I ordered a 5 piece tender meal and they gave me a 3 piece leg meal. My fries were cold and it took a long time to even get my food. I would drive an extra five minutes to a different Popeyes's or go to Raising Canes."}
{"text":"Came to this location thinking it's closer and more convenient but They didn't have no promotions. And they we're really slow! I was stuck in drive thru for a good 20 minutes!"}
{"text":"Every single time we go here they mess up our order and we don't see until we get home. The first time they gave us the wrong amount of chicken, second time we got no dip and the mac & cheese side was so small, and then this time we bought two apple pie slices and didn't get them. The chicken is always mediocre when at other locations it's been great. We usually love Popeyes but don't go nearly as much as we used to because they always mess up our order and we end up paying for it. If you really want Popeyes then go here but triple check your order because they will somehow mess something up."}
{"text":"**This is Just for this Popeye's Location**

Small Location, Not Too Much Seating, The Chicken Tenders were Fine, the Cajun Fries were Cold & They didn't give alot, it was more like SCATTERED all over My Tray! Customer Service was Just OK!

To use the Restroom, you'd have to use the Gas Station which is Adjoined to this Popeye's! 

They do have Specials Every Tuesday, I believe it was 1.29 for a 2 Pc. Meal & a Biscuit! 

Parking can be Tricky as it is part of a Strip Mall, There is a Drive Thru...which at times can get busy!"}
{"text":"We've been to several Popeye's in years past, but not in recent years and based on this visit, we will not return to one!  Dirty, sticky floor, dirty tables, booth seat not bolted down and things even worse when we ate our mediocre meals!  The chicken was over cooked and must have been sitting under lights for a while. Sides were ok, but not as good as we've had before. There were many staff members there (visiting with each other), but none working in the front area which needed cleaning so badly. Bleh!!"}
{"text":"Holy ballz!!! Is exactly how I want to start this review because I just ate the freshest most tastiest Popeyes ever.

I feel like this could be a fluke because never have I tasted it like this before. I will update my review in a few weeks as I will definitely be back, especially if they are spitting out food like this.

Let's start with the fried chicken.. it definitely had just came out of the fryer because it was so fresh. I got it spicy and it was seasoned to perfection. Crust was nice and crispy. Inside the meat was tender and juicy. Uh.. tasted like a dream.

The fries were very fresh as well. Even when we got home which was a ten minute drive they were still decent. 

Don't even get me started on the biscuits.. They were so fluffy!. Seasoned well and nice and hot. 

I have mention as well that the inside of the place was very clean. They do a good job of keeping up on the cleanliness.
 
People working there were very friendly. Like I said, I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"these people do not know how to make chicken, every time i have gotten chicken from them the meat is tuff and i always ask for spicy and there is absolutely no spice, if you want good popeyes in las vegas go to the maryland location 4910 s maryland pkwy"}
{"text":"Food was fine. My husband had to keep going back to the counter for things missing out of our order. But the customer service was decent, didn't like the fact that the closing manger threw some of my sauces on the counter but I guess that's acceptable out west."}
{"text":"1st visit @ this location, ordered a 12 piece inside the store to go. I got home, I was only given 8 pieces called to speak to a manager, phone busied out. Took a drive back explained to the manager what happened, he had an attitude about it, told one of the food handlers to go ahead and get 4 more pieces and added \"I don't know whatever\" to one of them. Didn't appreciate that I was being treated like I did something wrong by asking for the 4 pcs that were not given to me, not 1 apology from management or staff behind the counter. Not very good customer service, definitely going to take this one up chain."}
{"text":"I got bad news and I got bad new. Here' the bad news: I ordered one chicken breast, brought it home to add to chicken soup. While I don't generally eat the skin/breeding, as the soup heated I paused to taste the skin/breading. Tasteless. All that work, 66 spices or whatever Popeye's says, TOTALLY TASTELESS. 

Here's the other bad news: the chicken itself was equally tasteless. Not bland, not underwhelming, tasteless. In a blind taste test, it failed as airline food. 

Then, add in the fact he drive-thru speaker sucked, couldn't be heard. And, though It was 9:52 and these children were yelling at each other about closing. Do it WHEN you close. 

I really don't like Popeye's."}
{"text":"Well aware I'm sure you are of what caliber of fried chicken we have here. Same weight class as the often disappointing and always greasy, KFC. It's better, mind you. Much better. 

Spicy or Mild. Vaguely cajun. Crispy like you wouldn't believe. Biscuits are a must.

But don't confuse the best of the rest for the best of the best. This is good chicken, it's not great and its rarely memorable. Head over to Stockyards for the good stuff. Or Patois, I've heard too.

*The Ghost Pepper wings are a joke. They're as hot as the hot wings have always been."}
{"text":"Fail... pissed me off lst night. They were lazy and tried not to mke more chicken at the end of the night! Which just ended up putting them in the weeds when they got a rush. The 6 of purchasing chicken ended up waiting 20 mins or more for some damn chicken. They even got some of the others people order wrong. And tell your staff to not hang out when you clock out and chit chat with the others who are still on the clock and trade cookies and crap!"}
{"text":"This relatively new location of Popeye's franchise had me thrilled at first.  Only 5 min drive from home, it was going to be our go-to place for fried chicken goodness.  

We've visited this location 3 times so far and other than the first time, the other 2 visits were quite disappointing.  Maybe the first visit was good because the location was still new and the freshness of the ingredients, especially their frying oil, did not have enough time to sour over time.  

Our second visit for take out left all of us guzzling water the whole evening because the batter was super salty.  We are used to eating popeyes and this was definitely beyond their norm.  

Our third visit, we ordered wings (5 wings for $4.99 on Fridays) and 4 pc combo (spicy).  The wings were for my toddler and I was upset to see that they had packed spicy wings.  Poor thing had to eat just the meat near the bones to avoid the spice.  Their spicy chicken combo was over-fried and dried out.  It looked like they had fried it more than once and all the pieces had that distinctively stringy look.  

It looks to me like that this new location is already starting to cut corners with ingredients (not changing frying oils frequently enough, using pieces that barely have any meat on it...etc) and quality of the food they serve.  

I may give them another chance to redeem themselves and if they serve up the same sad fare, I'll drive the extra miles to go to the Pickering location for chicken."}
{"text":"I've always thought, \"why review a fast food joint?\" since they all seem to follow the same orders from their headquarters.  I never thought that I would feel compelled to write a review for one until tonight.  

While waiting some 20+ minutes for what was supposed to be a quick dinner stop turned into anything but that.  The place is so crammed with other patrons waiting to get their order with more people pouring in.  You would think that they would continue to drop more chicken into the fryer until the line up is under control.  There have been people waiting before me for 30+ minutes to get their order.  I don't know about you but waiting more than 30 min at a fast food joint seems unacceptable.

After some time, they tried to pawn off the spicy chicken saying that I would need to wait another 20 minutes for my mild chicken order.  I declined and waited another 15 minutes.  When I finally got my order, it was almost 40 min after I had walked into the joint.  

I'm not sure if I love fried chicken enough to endure this type of wait again.  I might as well bring up my own deep fryer and fry my own chicken.  :p"}
{"text":"Crew very impolite!  and food is stale.

I love Popeye's Chicken, but NOT at this store, ever!"}
{"text":"It's Popeyes, what else can I say. Delicious and very affordable. Got a 7 piece all thigh spicy and mild mix for $4.99. They were extremely quick with my order (as in I barely finished paying and it was ready for me) and they were very accommodating. Kinda outta the way, but for those staying in the area, it's the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Omg this place is amazing.  This was my first time and I'll never go back to KFC or canes again!  So clean, friendly, and the chicken was over the top good!"}
{"text":"Worst service I had in my life. Literally waited over 20 minutes to get 2 different orders. If you really want chicken, might as well go travel a couple more down the road"}
{"text":"After becoming a regular at this location I have to take away a star. The staff is always in a rush even when it's slow and as a result, 90% of the time something is wrong with my order. My suggestion to management (if you all even bother to read these reviews) is to focus on customer service by having your team slow down and make sure there is quality control in place where people review the order to make sure everything is there before handing them over to customers. Otherwise you're going to continue to have a bunch of pissed of customers. The food is great here but that only goes so far if my time is wasted by having to come back (if I don't catch the mistake there) and get my order corrected. I'd rather wait a few extra minutes to ensure my order is correct than be in and out quickly with the wrong order. It always takes more time to fix a mistake than if you had just taken the time to do things right the first time. Also, I don't know if you guys do this to cut costs but I don't eat like an animal so I shouldn't have to ask for utensils EVERY time I use the drive thru, it should just be a given. Just my 2 cents..."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I wouldn't give any stars if that was an option. We came into the store at around 1:30pm today. Waited almost 20 minutes just to order. Listened to the manager trash talk the new front register employee to the customers in front of the employee. Several different customers had complained about their order being wrong... The drive thru girls were talking to eachother and laughing when customers were getting upset because they were sitting at the speaker for several minutes just waiting to order. We spent almost $50, got our food home and the order was wrong!!! We have been trying to call the store for almost  3 hours and nobody will answer the phone. This place is a complete joke. We won't be spending our money here again."}
{"text":"I feel that places that are on University campuses strong arm the students that go to them, and sadly exactly that can be said about this Popeyes location. Being located on YorkU's Campus, they are one of the few \"eatable\" food offerings on campus. Having said that the staff is quite rude and lack any sort of customer service skills. I get that they get really busy, but that isn't an excuse to be rude to your customers (the same people who keep you in business). Customer service aside, the quality of the food served here is pretty bad and not up to the subpar level I expect from other Popeyes locations. If there is a day I don't get an upset stomach after eating food from here, it has been a good day! If you ever find yourself on YorkU's campus, do yourself a BIG favour and don't go here."}
{"text":"Every single time we visit this location, they're out of at least one of the items we want to order. This isn't even near closing; it's always during regular dinner hours. Sometimes it's the spicy recipe chicken, sometimes it's tenders, this last time it was sweet tea. The staff is always super duper nice about trying to make reasonable accommodations or suggesting a similar item, but it's always a hassle. You're better off visiting the standalone location on Flamingos & Maryland if you've got a specific item in mind. Also, not that it's their fault, but we're often approached by panhandlers when we decide to go into the store (that's probably because it's part of a Terrible's Convenience Center), so if I'm alone I make a point to use to the drive through."}
{"text":"Popeyes has always been my choice for a quick and cheap meal when craving for fried chicken. The crispiness of the well seasoned batter pairs well with the juicy chicken. The service is not too bad for a fast food chain as they do it with a smile. My only complaint is that there are other customers who tend to bud in line. Especially, on Tuesdays when there's the special."}
{"text":"Great food(for fast food) and even better customer service. Ordered strips or thought we did but got pieces, went back to exchange and was told to keep the pieces. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Well the front desk cashier was trying I'll give you that. But the manager had a major attitude. The new Cajun Wings we got were hard and cold. The last two times we tried to go to this location either the poboy bread wasn't in Stock or was frozen. So hmmm....I love Popeye's but this location needs better management."}
{"text":"This Popeyes is hot Garbage I pulled up to the drive they at 10:25 pm ( they close at 11) the drive thru said we are closed. I pull up to the window and the guy comes to the window. I ask don't you guys close at 11 he said yea then says what do you want I can check to see if we have it. Comes back says there's not much tenders and no biscuits. Um aren't you supposed to be a fast food make the damn food. 40 mins left to close smh."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I have every gotten. Our entire order was wrong and we were rushed through drive thru. Ended up over paying for our food because they gave us the wrong order and was less than we ordered. Our food was thrown into our car as we were hurried away. Would never recommend anyone go here as they will most likely be rude and get your order wrong."}
{"text":"Seriously worst experience just now ever at this Popeyes. The lady who took our order in the drive through would not listen to what we were trying to order so we ended up just saying yes to the last thing she said. Then once we got up to the window, she rolled her eyes at us when we asked for some sauce in which she never even asked if we wanted any. Btw..they were out of ranch. She didn't give us to go silverware when we asked for it twice and didn't provide us with honey for pur biscuits. This kind of service should not be allowed. How rude."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go, it's the prices of large drinks $ 2.50 WHY..... plus the honey packages are basically corn syrup.. not sure but about 3-5% real honey.. other than that the place was really clean everything was new as this place just opened. Had the mild chicken (good) next time might try the spicy chicken or fish.The mash potatoes and gravy was great but again one of the smallest sides in the restaurant business.. little disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the new Popeyes located on flamingo across the street from target. 

I am glad that added another eatery because the food options are limited during a 30 minute teacher lunch break. Popeyes is a yummy fried chicken eatery with delicious biscuits and yummy fries.

1/26/2018
Today's visit was very pleasant. I was acknowledged with a smile and a welcome upon entry. My cashier was super nice and offered me a cheaper meal with the same amount of food. My food didn't take long to come up and I was able to get some fresh spicy chicken.

The inside was very clean. You can definitely tell this is a new restaurant. Everything has a place. I recommend this new location for you fried chicken needs


P.S. I just hope a month or two from now the inside is still nice and clean."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in a hurry and in need for some yummy chicken, biscuits, honey and fries, I always come to Popeyes. I love their chicken but I prefer the biscuits and fries. I like to come at a time when they are the least busiest because I ask them to cook my fries fresh. 

On this visit the cashier was a young gentleman and it was very nice and offered great suggestions. I like to ask the workers what is their favorite thing on the menu before I order, so the next time a return I have something new to try. When I asked the young man if I could have some fresh fries cooked, he had no problem doing it and did it with a smile.

My fries were delicious and they were still hot and yummy when I made it home. This location also has a Tuesday dollar deal. In this deal you receive two pieces of chicken for little to nothing."}
{"text":"I love Popeyes chicken and biscuits with honey!!!!

One Saturday night, we decided our cheat meal would be Popeyes and we tried a new location. This Popeyes is attached to a seven eleven store, so there is plenty of well lit parking. 

The inside of the restaurant was very clean. The floors, tables, drink station & behind the counter were spotless .

I order a 8 piece mid chicken meal with fresh fries and a side and 8 biscuits. When I order from any fast food place, I always ask for fresh food (fries, biscuits &chicken). I wait because the chicken is usually fries and hot but fries only take about 3 minutes to cook a fresh batch. I also check my food at the counter before I leave. If I am unhappy, then I ask the employees for something fresher. 

Lucky at this location I only had to wait about 3 minutes for my delicious fresh fries. 

The cashier and the other employees were nice and my fast. If I ever choose Popeyes chicken as my cheat meal, I will return to this location."}
{"text":"I gave them 1-star only because you cannot submit a zero-star rating. Horrible experience.  Hubby placed a simple order...3-pieces white meat spicy, 1 extra spicy breast, and 2-pieces dark meat mild. 6 pieces total.  Also wanted onion rings as a side, but this location apparently doesn't do onion rings. When he got the order home, there were two boxes of 2-piece dark meat. Went back to get the order re-done. He was asked if he wanted the original incorrect order because they would just throw it out anyway.  He said Yes, thank you. Good thing he did 'cause  when he got home we found the ONLY part of the order they replaced was the 3-piece white meat spicy.  If he hadn't brought home the original incorrect order, we would have ended up with only three pieces of spicy chicken. Of course, by the time he got back home, everything in the original incorrect order was stone-cold. OH! And they had mixed spicy dark in with the mild dark. Not worth a 3rd trip to try to get it right.  Won't be going back there, again."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I've ordered a 3 piece white meat  and they gave me a thigh, leg and wing. The 1st 2 times I just settled for but  this time I was not happy because the thigh looks like a broken off piece of chicken and it was not fresh. My fries looked like crumbs from left over fries. So I called and I didn't get no answer it sound like it was a fax machine number. Please don't patronize this location their the worst."}
{"text":"Customer service is definitely lacking. I come here often enough to know that a 20 minute wait in the drive thru needs to be a bit quicker. The last time I came here there were 2 cars ahead of me and I ended up being boxed in so I was in the drive thru for 20 minutes. I was asked for my drink order 4 different times. The quality has been slacking in their chicken fingers so I started driving to another Popeyes and it is so much better. The mashed potatoes was my favorite but lately it's been watery and since they have to put the time it \"expires\" on the bottom of the container a lot of the times it was over that time. Since their expansion they just don't have it together and I'm going to wait a few before I return back to this location. There are a few other Popeyes not too far from this one so the convenience factor isn't an issue for me."}
{"text":"It Smells! I am not a fan of gas stations attached fast food resturants.  This circl K (my grandson Avery calles it OK) gas sation proved my fears to be true. 
The level of trash and stained concrete was the first thing you see. I push through and I reach the smeared glass door. I enter the door step in ready to order my Breast and rice and beans when a horrible stench nothing remotely resembling food, hit my noise like a slap and in one motion of entering I exited."}
{"text":"Fabulous service and attentive staff.  Rhythm was such a nice greeter and they made sure to check their allergy list when I mentioned my daughter was allergic to nuts. Very friendly and made sure we took advantage of free dessert offer."}
{"text":"Two only because the people so far have been friendly and I like the biscuits. Now I ordered their catfish dinner - I was wrong it had only two pieces in it their picture shows three! And, the two pieces really only equated to one piece! Not sure how I'll handle my future eating; their very convenient but for what I got it was very pricey! Love the TV ADS - but this place isn't living up to their value advertising! Tried to call the number from the internet didn't connect , I guess it's a top secret number!"}
{"text":"Ever since we had been to New Orleans, Louisiana and tried their Popeyes' Blackened Ranch dipping sauce, we have been waiting for this to come to Toronto.

We got Popeyes coupons in the mail and I have been itching to use it.  Now is that time, Saturday afternoon!

Went over to our local Popeyes close by and it's in the same plaza as Khorak Supermarket, a Persian grocery store which can get a little busy with congested parking.

I go in and order a Spicy Chicken Sandwich combo with mashed potatoes and an iced tea.  The coupon I had was if I bought a sandwich combo, I would get a loaded chicken wrap for free.  Awesome!  Eating for 2.

The cashier did everything and I was impressed.  She cashed me out, she went to the back and made the sandwich, wrap and spooned mashed potatoes and gravy.  Although she was not smiling, she put everything neatly and in order.  You know when you're impressed when you start nodding your head and I found myself doing just that.

Get to my seat, give the wrap to Hakka Wife and start to dig in, like the Lenny Kravitz song.  The sandwich was neat and intact and tasted great.  Chicken breast was crispy and soft with fresh tomatoes and lettuce.  The spicy sauce was not spicy at all and I was okay with it.  It was even better when I dunked it in the Blackened Chicken Sauce.  Creamy flavour that I have been waiting for!

Overall, the customer service, presentation and the taste, I give it 4 outta 5.  I know it's fast food but I'll still Yelp it!"}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times and each time I've had to pull over to wait but have placed large orders. Last night we went to grab dinner for my daughter's family and my husband, daughter and myself. We ordered the 16 piece meal and the young employee at the window was very friendly! We only waited about 4 minutes in the parking stall before he RAN out with our bag. I asked about honey and he said he would go and grab some but my daughter said she had some at home. He was probably in high school but super nice & friendly. By the time we got back to my daughter's house, about 12 minutes away, the chicken and biscuits were still very hot and I could tell that the chicken had been freshly made. Everything was great! Fed 7 people for about $34."}
{"text":"CAN WE SAY I LOVE TUESDAY'S JUST FOR LEG AND THIGH FOR $1.47 MMMM HMMMM Yes As good as it giets!"}
{"text":"Omg get it together! 
Two soft drink choices were out, then the chicken wasn't made so I was quoted a 2 minutes wait at drive thru. After 5 minutes they asked me to park and when I inquired about time they said another 10 minutes. I waited 30 MINUTES. 
Finally I went in (after numerous calls went to voicemail) and they apparently had forgotten about it. The kid at the counter said \"I just got back from break\" I demanded a refund, mgr on duty chit chatted with employee about it for another 3 minutes then made me bring the receipt in from my car. 
More time wasted having to go back to my car. I've spent 40 minutes at this drive thru for one combo meal."}
{"text":"My fiance tried popeyes for the first time ever in 2018 at this location. He ordered and paid for a 3 piece chicken and returned home to find out that he only received two pieces - both of which he said was mediocre. He thinks that his relationship with popeyes probably wasn't meant to be, despite the fries being good with a nice kick to it."}
{"text":"Okay seriously. This Popeyes just opened up and they already suck. First of all the young girl at the drive through had the worst attitude and acted like we were wasting her time. Second they got the order completely wrong didn't even get my real order. Third they over charged me for the wrong order!! I mean it's chicken...not rocket science."}
{"text":"Thieves!!! Charged my card $28 for my 7.34 order.  Called right away and was told that it would clear within a few days.  The manager isn't there until Thurs.  WTF?  It's only Tuesday ... I hate when this happens please don't go here..."}
{"text":"Employees are nice and the food is good but service is VERY slow. Expect a wait for your food and don't be surprised if something is missing or wrong about the order. As the only chicken place in the area, it's tolerable, but would not recommend unless you're desperate for chicken."}
{"text":"Garbage. The people there are very rude. Teach your employees some customer service skills and hire a real manager."}
{"text":"They close at 9pm but saw me drooling so took my order and hooked me up. Love the chicken love the service. Way to go the extra mile for your customers"}
{"text":"Every once and a while I need my Popeyes fix.  This one is close to work.  Always chaotic and a tad 'hood but it adds to the Popeyes experience.  They take coupons no prob and the ladies are always nice.  9/10 they get our order right.  God, I hope those guys cooking back there get paid well because they always hustlin'!"}
{"text":"Only one word to describe this place, terrible. Chicken strip were dry and gave me the worst food poisoning I've ever had."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean, very nice and quite busy. The staff was abundant and courteous, Louis the manager was great, went above and beyond our expectations. The food was cooked perfectly and served hot to our table. That was a bonus. If all of Popeyes new stores are all like this they will have amazing success because we couldn't ask for more in a dining experience with Popeyes. We look forward to the store on 75th Avenue near us opening later this week!!!"}
{"text":"If I could avoid a star I would. Brand new location had to wait 10-15 minutes for 10 piece dinner, get home mash potatoes were in bottom of bag, chicken was barely cooked! Best of ALL no Tuesday special."}
{"text":"Every time I come through here there is always something wrong with my order. They forget to give me all items or just make something wrong. I hope they get it together."}
{"text":"Finally the best chicken in the world (in my opinion) opened!! 

We got a family meal 12 piece with red beans and rice, seasoned French fries and biscuits. Every thing was freshly made! 

Buttery biscuits, red beans and rice are always delicious! The chicken was very crispy and tender. I would definitely recommend coming here. I am sure they will stay busy for a while since they just opened recently.

Way to go Popeyes!!"}
{"text":"Place is dirty. Flat out filthy. Dirty tables. Sticky counters. I ordered the cat fish and the employee advised me to not order it bc people were getting sick off it. I'm thankful for the heads up, but why do they still serve it? There's another Popeyes down the street on flamingo and Maryland. I just go there."}
{"text":"Had to stop by this place and get some food.  It was delicious and SUPER FRESH!  Got a 12 piece meal as well as a 3 piece tender meal for the kids.  They normally charge for extra sauces but they gave me an extra bbq for my son with no cost.  I went through the drivethru and was super indecisive as it's been a long while since I've eaten there.  

Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Slowest service ever! 
Went at 12:30pm one day and the drive thru had no kidding, at least 10 cars so decided to order inside. Well, to my surprise I had 6 persons in front of me. Took 20 min just to order. People were desperate, only one cashier and it had to be the worst of all (Nisset) I believe. She worked with the slowest pace I've ever seen. A customer complained to her about the service and left. So instead of hurrying up, she goes to the back and leaves the rest of us in line just waiting. I had ordered a with a friend the same thing and instead of doing them together she did my order first did something else and then did my friend's order. The food was already cooked since we got there. OMG I was so frustrated just looking at the pace she was doing everything. 40 Min for a \"fast food\" place NEVER returning there."}
{"text":"It is extremely rare that food is so bad that I can't eat it and have to throw it out (as a matter of fact, I can only think of two times in my life I have ever done that). But this chicken was absolutely awful, and after a couple of bites, I threw the entire eight piece chicken meal in the trash. I ordered half mild and half hot spicy. The spicy chicken was cold and all dried out, and tasted terrible. The mild chicken was not cold or dried out, but had zero flavor...it's almost as if they did not use any seasoning at all. My suggestion would be, if you want some decent take out chicken, then stick with KFC or El Polo Loco, but stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"45 minutes! 

That's right! 45 minutes to dine-in and be served a sorry excuse for a fried chicken dinner.

I swear, I remember eating at a Popeye's several years ago and finding the chicken to be acceptable for the standards of fast food. But either my palette has evolved or the quality control has simply gone down the tubes. I'm not entirely sure. Has it always been bad? Or am I only now realizing that it's bad?

My girlfriend and I stopped by this Popeye's on a Friday night and ordered two fairly basic meals. She opted for a three-piece tender meal with a side of mashed potatoes, while I ordered a couple of legs with a side of mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. This should be easy, right?

Honestly, I'm not sure what went wrong. After twenty minutes, I started tracking the time with my watch. The restaurant was practically empty, although they did appear to be preparing orders for the drive-thru that presumably took first priority over us. But why that would impact our wait time is irrelevant.

45 minutes later, our food was finally given to us in to go bags, despite the receipt saying that we would be dining in. Although I think by this point, they took so long making our food that the place was ready to close. Since we didn't anticipate that this would consume almost an hour of our evening, they didn't want us sticking around.

The chicken was dry and poor quality, tasting as if it was old, despite being freshly fried. The mashed potatoes are the equivalent of the sludge served at KFC. Not surprisingly, they forgot one of my sides, as well as our drinks, so I had to stand around blankly and wait for someone to acknowledge my presence. The biscuits are standard pre-made rubbish, while the mac and cheese was the only thing that I at least found semi-edible, only because it's a guilty pleasure.

In the end, I give Popeye's a single star - and that's only because they continue to offer fried apple pies, the one item that I wish McDonald's never eliminated back in the early 90s.

Trust me, people. Good fried chicken in Phoenix does exist. I promise you! But don't rely on Popeye's to deliver, because that's just not being realistic.

Avoid them!"}
{"text":"This location has great customer service and the drive thru staff is very kind and prompt!"}
{"text":"These people need some serious help. I've been twice and both times were a complete cluster.  No offense but these are some of the most undertrained/borderline incompetent individuals I've ever encountered. The girl at the cash register was thoroughly unfamiliar with basic principles of customer service, such as smiling, eye contact, being friendly and helpful. She barely mumbled a few words and could not have been less interested in doing her job. During my 20 minute wait for 6 pieces of chicken, 3 different people came into the restaurant to complain that they got their drive-through order wrong. They also managed to lose my order despite the fact that I was standing 6 feet away from them the entire time with a look of great disbelief. Mass confusion prevailed behind the counter throughout my visit and they just had no clue what the hell they were doing. Someone from corporate needs to pay this place a visit and see for themselves why this location has such crappy Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"The staff here needs to be replaced. Came here for the first time and left very disappointed. Got my food very fast and in that moment I thought to myself that this could possibly be good or all the way bad. AND IT IS ALL BAD. I ordered 5 pc chicken tenders. My box looked full, but little did I know that my chicken tenders were too tough to even bite. It was probably left under the warmer sitting for hours, and my fries looked under cooked but also old. I noticed that the staff were all teenagers and I have no problem with that, but seriously though, they need to reevaluate why they're working there if they can't do their job. Total waste of $10 I could have spent on something else."}
{"text":"Rude manager, how do I order a dinner & you have the audacity to charge me 0.27 for some honey ? The manager was so rude that I couldn't believe it ! They need new management ASAP. Sadly I should of listened to the other reviews"}
{"text":"Don't go to this Popeyes expecting fast food. They must have a different motto as the other Popeyes. They are extremely slow and by the time you get your good you are lucky if you get what you ordered, not to mentioned of its cooked all the way. The manager doesn't even seem to be concerned, only response they know how to give is \"oops sorry\".  While waiting 30 minutes for my to go order I heard numerous other customer complain about the wait time as well. I get it has just opened but you don't have to have a masters degree to figure out how to cook and serve chicken at a responsible pace. Every other new restaurant has figured it out, why are the hires at this place special.  Would be surprise of this place stays above water, the only thing it has going for it is it's name. If you decide to go here clear your schedule."}
{"text":"Waited in line literally 21 minutes. People were honking and leaving, and it was all because of one car waiting on something in front. What ever happened to asking them to pull forward and letting the line get on? To top it off, employee who gave us our food was a dick about it."}
{"text":"This popeyes is very friendly service. One of my favourite worker at the counter is Gagondeep Brar she is very friendly and always smiling great to the customers, very hard worker i see her there all the time."}
{"text":"I love Popeye's and am glad one is on The Strip now.  The employees were very friendly, \"Ayminah\" made a recommendation and my food was hot and fresh.  

Great service!"}
{"text":"Ugh, this place!  Ordered two meals and desserts from the drive-thru window. Driving home, I realized they only gave me one bag. I thought, \"Man, I hope they didn't put my desserts in with the hot food.\" Turns out, they didn't give me my desserts at all, and I'm missing all the sauces too. So I drove back to the window and the girl gave me my other bag. I get home and I'm still missing one of the items that I ordered. Arrgh! And don't tell me to check the bags before I leave, when there are other cars behind me.  How about just getting the order right and giving me what I paid for.

Oh and also... they gave me spicy chicken and I ordered mild."}
{"text":"So bad.  Poor quality chicken, small pieces.  The 1/4 lb popcorn chicken?  About 8 tiny pieces.  Oh and the women working here are SO loud and speak in another language, very rude, and act like they hate their jobs.  I won't be back, it just so awful."}
{"text":"I want to give more not to hurt their star rating but take me with a grain of salt. 

I'm a LA native so I'm soooo over Popeye's. 
Until the day you move away and can never pick up quick home goodness. 

3 stars because they served me room temp cold onion rings. 
Child, I know it's PayDay $5.99 special day but come on. These are always made to order and today it's soooo busy that everything should be hot and piping like our
1) Biscuits; 
2) Chicken; 
3) Red Beans 

Two drive thru lines here. 
5 stars for knowing to offer Breakfast and ALLLLLLllllllllllllllll the Louisiana Legends.

What are Louisiana Legends pre tell?
Jambalaya, 
Shrimp Etoufee, 
PoBoys, 
Onion Rings 
the sides that you don't traditionally see at a fast food place outside of Cajun Country. 

They're even offering RICE Dressing. 
Ah man! I've got to give them 4.25 stars. But only within this review. 
Have fun. 
Order anything
Service is still new so they're good (for now)."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to my previous review but here's a snippet:

Service - hit or miss but in and out. 
Food Quality - I order wraps and seafood so they have to be made to order which is fine by me. Same franchise flavor. 

Cost: Popeye's has always been overpriced and I'm a hometown girl - mean Al Copeland and I share the same hometown (he invented Popeye's) so I lean towards Church's Chicken for flavor and price. Alas, no Church's here and closest is 100 miles away.  DEALS ARE MAINTAINED AT THIS LOCATION THAT WOULD NEVER EVER EXIST IN THE SOUTH. HENCE: 1/2 chicken on Tuesday and Saturday - they would close the doors at home. 

Decor: Jazzy and duplicated correctly. Makes me miss NOLA. 

Drive-Thru & Lot: pretty clean. Snow removal could be better. 

Could have been a 4 star but all in all it's a solid 3.5.

Sides are worthwhile from the flour battered onion rings to the biscuits. 

They don't serve breakfast at this location. 
Hankering for catfish but don't want to cook it .... the pieces here are sufficient but BEWARE they are cut New England style."}
{"text":"Jeez, i can see how this place only has 2 stars.    Mediocre food, and at a high price for what you get.    Fast service got them that extra star in this case.      

This is my second time visiting this location.   There won't be a third."}
{"text":"Nice,friendly staff. Clean restaurant. Popcorn shrimp, shrimp po'boy and cajun fries were good. Chicken tenders are very average. Good selection of sides."}
{"text":"Stopped into this location on a Tuesday.  Asked if they had the two for Tuesday special.  Was told that they didn't;  that the manager didn't think they needed it because they were a new location.  I guess new locations don't need customers.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"You know, there aren't many of these around. I don't know why that is. This is definitely a good change to the local McD. 

The place is clean and the staff is friendly. Although, the place just opened a couple of days ago, so, we shall see in 1 months time (that's right, I'm coming back). 

The biggest problem with this location is the parking. The spots are a lot tighter than normal. I parked and was afraid of how the guy parking next to me was going to open his door. He did a pretty good job of squeezing out of his car. 

But, I will be back in 1 month and I will update this post ... if needed."}
{"text":"We've tried this Popeyes twice and won't be trying a third. How can a chicken place run out of chicken with 3 customers in the place all waiting for orders. After 15 min we were told it'd be another 8. We asked for refund and left. From now on we'll just keep going to the one in San Tan"}
{"text":"The first time we went to this particular location. They sold me a promotional item. So, I paid the extra charge and the team member even confirmed the order on the speaker and at the booth. I thought \"wow, they really want to be accurate.\" Well, we got home and the item they sold me on was NOT there. I went back and got it and just thought \"it happens.\" Now, we went a second time, and this time they also did NOT put the items we ordered in the bag. Once, okay. Twice on two totally different days and weeks apart? That says something about the business."}
{"text":"I've had an issue every time that I have gone. They forgot my order the first time. The second time they did not put the sides I requested. The third time, they did not have condiments available."}
{"text":"One star was only awarded to write this review. I really try to be understanding when service companies are struggling - I don't complain, and rarely write review. But my experience tonight was the worst service I've ever experienced. It took the very rude drive cashier nearly 10 minutes to take our order as our car sat at the speaker. We were only the second car total in the line so we weren't sure why it took so long. When she did respond, her tone was bored, disengaged, even rude. She rushed us \"is that all?\" several times. We would have ordered dessert if she'd allowed us to before reporting our total. Further, when we pulled around the corner the only other car in line WAS STILL THERE! (remember we waited 10 minutes for our order to be taken). Her tone seeing us in person did not change. She told us \"foods coming shortly\" and closed the window without looking at us. We waited another 10 minutes. I'm appalled places like this get to be in business and take money from people for a \"service\" that doesn't feel like a service at all. This is only our 2nd time to Popeyes and I'm sure after today that we won't go back. Stay away! 

Oh! Let's not forget how hard it was to even get this feedback heard! Local number at the bottom of the receipt was the stores phone that an employee none-the-wiser answered. \"I'm calling to offer customer feedback.\" \"I'm not sure what to do with that, is this the number you meant to call?\" Then the 1-800 number on the back of the receipt \"Please note the call line has been discontinued.\" This was literally the only way I could let anyone know this service is THE WORST."}
{"text":"Decided to try out this Popeyes when it first opened since I work nearby. My buddy and I went and the building is very nice and clean. The front service at the register were not the most friendly and did not seem to know what he was doing and was very short with me. There was also a lot of employees just sitting around at the tables. Other than that the cleanliness and look of the place was good."}
{"text":"Made my first (and last) visit yesterday after work to get dinner for the family. I went through the drive-thru and the first tick was when the ordertaker was rushing me through my order. I am by no means a procrastinator and I only ordered 3 simple meals. The second tick was at the window the cashier and her 'boyfriend' were fawning over each other and looked annoyed when I rolled up.

When she returned my card to me, she looked me dead in the eye with either contempt or braggadoccio; I couldn't tell. When I drove off, my initial thought was I hope they didn't tamper with my food and I will not be revisiting this store. 

When I got home to eat the food, I was disappointed in the size of the chicken. My drumstick looked like a jumbo buffalo wing. the thigh had more fried coating than meat. the beans and rice were good. Sadly this is a new location. if I were the owner/franchisee, I'd be cleaning house, based on these reviews alone and maybe going to corporate for a better product."}
{"text":"First time trying Popeyes ever and not very impressed. Sat in the drive thru for about 20 minutes to get my food. The staff was really friendly and great.  The food was terrible, very little chicken on the two pieces I got and the fries were cold.  Was excited to try this place but definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"As a former restaurant manager I've had a few observations. The food is consistently good. The store is always clean and organized when Paige is managing."}
{"text":"Okay so it started off in the drive-through as I rolled my window down I'm greeted by the cigarette smoke of the three hoodlum looking employees were taking a smoke break right next to where you order. One of them was a loudly screaming profanities and talking about his baby mama and how she did him wrong. Real classy! Then after staring at the menu for three minutes someone finally comes over the intercom. What I expected to hear was hi good afternoon thank you for choosing Popeye's chicken how may I help you but instead I get a rude \"what?\" I ignore it, I place my order, I drive around to the window, there's a woman who looks like she's doing everything by herself while three male employees are leaning on the counter, talking one of them with his finger picking his teeth. Like I understand that maybe Popeyes doesn't pay their employees really well but what is the application process to actually work at this place? Show up with a heartbeat? Be able to blink? To say The least, it's unsettling when you're trying to patronize a business, and you feel like you're visiting the Social Security office. It's a real shame because every other restaurant in Peoria seems to have it together. If you're going to continue to hire animals then you can expect reviews like this to continue...."}
{"text":"Poorly prepared chicken. Our order of a 3 piece chicken order was dry and tasteless. My wife's chicken strips looked like they had been sitting under the warmer for a few weeks. Disappointing since other Popeye's locations have served much tastier meals."}
{"text":"On 12/26 around 9:20 pm Drive through customer service was horrible. The girl had a bad attitude not one bit of friendliness.
It's so upsetting when you are a paying customer and you get a crappy attitude no thank you no nothing... not to mention they took about 15 to through drive through with no cars in front of me. I'll go spend my money else where."}
{"text":"For my first time .... I was a little sad the it took so long to order when not one person was in the drive through. Then my food took way to long and it wasn't so good . 

The young kids were talking and cursing and I heard the whole convo waiting for my food . I give 4 stars because 1. I was once a kid and your just a teen who needs money for shoes and clothes lol you don't care about your job. Let's be real!  2. the food saved the day!!!! LMBO  and 3. because the chicken is bomb lol
I think that's good enough ! Ok bye !!!!"}
{"text":"Sent the hubby to grab some Naked Tenders. He came back with the most salty and greasy tenders ever! I didn't even finish eating them. I'm only giving them two stars for the biscuit and my husband seemed to be satisfied with his shrimp meal. This is why I hardly ever eat fast food."}
{"text":"Your standard Popeye's.

Wait times can get long because there are two people working usually, but stagger your schedule a bit and you can avoid nasty lines.

The food is exactly what you expect it to be. This place tends to overfry their chicken, so there where be extra crispy breading. So if you're into that...Go for it. It does get a little overwhelmingly greasy after a few bites though.

Ghost pepper wings aren't that spicy, so bad job on the marketing team for that. They should have regular small wings imo...Nobody eats whole wings.

If you're craving the crispy chicken of Popeye's, stop by."}
{"text":"The employee women with the green shirt and lighten ends has a horrible attitude. She yells at customers and gets upset if you don't hurry up with ordering. She gives dirty looks and looks you up and down. She got my order wrong, I order with no tomatoes but I got tomatoes."}
{"text":"I usually love Popeye's!! But this location ruined it for me!!!!! They deserve a negative star rating! Im Mad i had to give them 1 star!! Got basic 5 piece chicken strip meal with red beans an rice ( which was dry & nasty ) an wasnt even half of the cup filled. The chicken after only 1 bite tasted like it sat under the warming light for days it was hard. Portions were horriable!! My wife's meal was fish an shrimp. Her shrimp was like rubber an she couldn't bite thru her fish. Truly one of my worst experiences with food. And thats saying alot, Been around the world twice an ate in many different countries. The only thing that was good was the strawberry fanta. An thats because they didnt have anything to do with it!!!    Dont think i'll ever eat Popeye's again."}
{"text":"Well that was enough to make me not want to finish this...
Pretty gross.
Not to mention the service seemed rushed. Wasn't told my total at any point. Had to check my bank statement to see how much I actually paid. Wrongs sides then had to wait to get that sorted as well. What can you really expect from a chain restaurant latched on to a gas station though."}
{"text":"Believe it or not I think this Popeyes is the busiest restaurant in the plaza. Much busier than Sushi Sushi, Subway, Pizza Nova, and even Tao Canteen. Or maybe because I came on a Tuesday night and Tuesday is their $2.99 2-piece special...

I don't go to Popeyes much, but the first thing I took away from this place is that service is slow. I only ordered two of the Tuesday specials, but it still took upwards of 10 minutes for everything to come out. It definitely didn't feel like fast food service, per se.

As for the food, I find the inside of the chicken better than the KFC, but KFC has better skin. Popeyes skin (at least the skin in this place) was too thick and constituted too much of the chicken. However, the chicken meat was much juicier than KFC, and was very hot as well, meaning freshly made.

I don't mind either KFC or Popeyes, especially when it comes to their Tuesday specials. Currently Popeyes is closer to home for me and has an eat-in option, so perhaps I could come back here more if I'm craving fried chicken."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. The staff wasn't very friendly. I observed at least 5 different orders in a row that were incorrect and when the customer asked about issue they received negative remarks back. No napkins stocked or spoons.  One lady even took here chicken back saying it didn't seem cooked good. My chicken strips were supposed to be Spicy but they were tasteless. I have been to Popeyes 4 different countries and had a wonderful  experience in all but this one. Based on this experience it will be a long time before I go back to Popeyes."}
{"text":"Food is always piping hot and fresh. Sides are always so good especially their gravy.  I'd agree with some other reviews that the drive through process probably needs some help and they should offer condiments like honey and hot sauce. Luckily I'm always headed home after, but usually they forget my utencils too."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from the chicken here,  and I'm all salty because I love popeyes. I've loved it since I was a wee little kid, but it has turned on me in the form of vomit and nausea.  I've always self identified as a lover of fried chicken but this food poisoning is giving me an identity crisis."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Popeye's. This particular location may not be the best, however it is very good. It is connected to a Terrible Herbst (I don't know if this a good or bad thing)  I will continue to debate with myself what is better, the red beans and rice or the cajun rice."}
{"text":"I stopped by on Saturday night and ordered their 16 piece meal for $34.99.  I paid for the food in their drive thru and went home.  When I got there the order was wrong.  I took the mistake item back to the restaurant and waited in line for 10 plus minutes to speak with the manager, Tiffany.  I explained to her about the mistake and asked for compensation for my time and gasoline.  Her answer was she would replace the item and give me a couple of pieces of chicken.  I explained to her that I had spent nearly 40 minutes driving and waited in line so I thought a little more was owed for their mistake.  She stated that was all that she was willing to do and that was the end of it.

I explained that I did not make the mistake but that I would be filing a disputed charge on my credit card.  I left the mistaken food and walked out.  This store has extremely poor customer service!  I would have been happy if she would have replaced my missing item and offered more than a couple of chicken wings.

I would recommend staying away from this store as their is another chicken special restaurant within the North Olmsted area.  I will be calling their regional and corporate offices."}
{"text":"*THIS REVIEW IS ONLY ABOUT THEIR DELIVERY*

WOW Okay. There are better locations of Popeyes, and if you want to order delivery this is not the chain to go. 

The food came in around an hour, taking way longer than expected. I live pretty close to this chain and I've had other restaurants deliver in a much shorter time. The driver had a horrible attitude towards us. He said, \"gas money isn't cheap\" and then deducted money from the change he was supposed to give us. I looked through the reviews on justeat and this driver used that exact same sentence to many other customers as well! 

The quality of food is pretty consistent with other Popeyes- oily chicken, steamy poutine and light coleslaw- and of course it gave me a stomachache right afterwards. Anyway, this Popeyes is no good. I will order from another chain if I have fried chicken cravings, thanks."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  I ordered 30 dollars of chicken for carry out and was told hot chicken would be out in 5 minutes. There were lots of folks waiting. Some at the drive-through, some by the pop machine, some by the trash cans.  I waited too but also noticed a lot of chicken on trays under the heat lamps.  I was thinking it had sat there all day. I was glad I was getting hot, fresh chicken.  Then the guys in the back says chicken is up and pours a basket of chicken on top of the chicken sitting on the trays. Everyone grabs tongs and fills orders for all those waiting ..except me.  It appeared they ran out.  Everyone leaves and there I stand .   I am still waiting as a lady comes in and ordered a $20 family meal.  She is told it will be 15 minutes until hot chicken. Then they served my box all the peices that had previously been sitting when I walked in. I left pissed. The chicken was dry and stringy. It tasted like chewey dough. We threw it all out. Rip off."}
{"text":"I been here plenty of time since they opened. I figured it was time to write a review.  After reading all these negative feedback I had to defend the chicken. 
I have never had an issue with my order when using the drive thru and I always order the same.

16 piece-chicken meal (half spicy/half original) is always a hit with my kids.  Mashed potatoes and coleslaw is on point.  Warm biscuits to the finish line with ice cold sweet tea.  Yumz.

Treat it like an ethnic restaurant and ignore the service, then your golden."}
{"text":"Y'all know I love dat chicken at Popeyes, but this time I have to kivetch a bit. I was not fortunate to land in the appropriate C terminal where this is located and had a long walk to the venue to get some long awaited Cajun yard bird! But alas ... I found it to be twice the cost of regular Popeyes anywhere else and then...it happened. I walked back to my terminal to eat my bounty only to find that the order was shorted!!! I cried for a moment until I realized that I was being forced on a diet by the fried chicken Gods. I know that's not right! The remaining piece was seasoned as I like it...spicy. The biscuit was also non greasy at second glance. I was disappointed that the famous dirty rice seems to have a new recipe and it is less desirable than previous experience. 
Y'all know I'm gonna go back again though. I just will pay more attention and review my order to ensure higher satisfaction later ."}
{"text":"Alright, I'm trying to tell myself to tone down some of the words that were used by my boyfriend during this visit, to explain the frustration and anger at the length of time this place stole from our lives. 

The amount of excuses we volleyed was the kindness in our hearts that we were trying to find for 24 min delay from our day IN THE DRIVE-THROUGH. 

Pulled into the drive through at 8:05pm and saw a couple cars and as it was dinner time, assumed this to be a given.  The order taker (young male) sounded like he kept getting side tracked and not only repeated questions between pauses, but asked us if \"that completed our order\" before telling him which drink we wanted with our combo. 

After the long wait, the change on my hair color, and accepting that I was going to be late for work, we finally get to the window and asked from some lady if we already paid and what our order was. This  place cannot be categorized as fast food. Finally drove away with one order of food (number 5 with fries, an extra biscuit, and a apple pie) at 8:29. 

Sorry, not sorry. We won't even be back. One star because the food wasn't terrible."}
{"text":"This is our first time to a Popeye's. Wonderful experience for fast food. We sampled most of the menu. Everything was tasty. I'm not a fan of fast food Mac and cheese but this is great!!! Expected the mashed potatoes to be like KFC, but the Cajun Gravy made all the difference in the world. We're trying to be health conscious, but will return when we're okay to junk out...."}
{"text":"Floor was dirty, not enough seating, kitchen was a mess, but the chicken was tasty, had the spicy wings with bland green beans and a biscuit.  The wings were a bit scrawny considering the 7 dollar price.  Not a man sized meal and no comparison to Bojangles.  I may eat here again but not sure."}
{"text":"This location has just opened, it is still very new and clean, the staff is well prepared for your visit!

Don't be fooled by the long lines, they move fast. Both drive thru windows are open, and while the lines wrap through the entire dining area you will be at the cashier within a few minutes.

The staff is very friendly, helpful and courteous. The food is hot, fresh and delicious.

Welcome to Charlotte Popeye's!"}
{"text":"More employees than customers in the dining room.  Hmm. 

Food is over priced and awful. I've had Popeye's before elsewhere ,  this is not on par.  Too many kids behind the counter not knowing what they're doing.  Chaos. 

Give it a few months,  try it out then,  if it's still open..."}
{"text":"I told my wife not to bring anything home from here. Its unhealthy grease filled chicken. Turns out Ive been running to the BR every 15 minutes all day and my wife is on her way home from work not feeling well. We both have Food Poisioning..I had a Breast last night and she had a wing. Now she agrees to never to go here ever again, even with free coupons. The worst......"}
{"text":"Kind of disgusted that none of the employees re not wearing any hair nets. Not on their head or bread. Makes me think twice about returning."}
{"text":"The service is horrible, standing in front of the counter for 25 min waiting for food with no interaction with the guest at all!!!"}
{"text":"This review won't cover the general quality of Popeye's chicken because it's simply delicious. Period. Instead I'm reviewing this specific Popeye's location relative to the rest because it's easily the best Popeye's I've ever been to. 

The staff here are friendly and polite and have never messed up my orders during my (embarrassingly) frequent visits. More importantly though, the food quality at this particular location is incredible. The chicken is always hot and cooked fresh, same with the fries and biscuits which both had delicious crispy exteriors and fluffy hot interiors. In the few times I've found my way to any other location I always get cold dry food which pales in comparison to what's served at the Eglinton store. If I could give this particular location 6 stars I would."}
{"text":"This Popeyes has a rude ass lady running the drive through very short with her words. Ordered my food to go in the drive through. The lady didn't even ask what kind of sauce I wanted, I asked what kinds they had also got a very short response. I came in because I knew something was going to be wrong while I'm still waiting over 10 Minutes so far, once I came inside they of course dropped the wrong tenders. Very displeased with the service and rudeness of the staff."}
{"text":"I get chicken tenders  shrimp ketchup ranch hot sauce BBQ ghost pepper jelly French fries"}
{"text":"Always just get chicken tenders and red beans here. Hasn't let me down yet, except for the time I got thighs instead... Just mediocre. Nothing special, like any other Popeyes."}
{"text":"Awful!

Ordered 2 surf and turf orders.. one with fries one with green beans and 12 ghost pepper wings..

1st surf and turf had 5 shrimp and 2 chicken tenders 
2nd surf and turf had 6 shrimp and 4 tenders
Wings like the shrimp were so overcooked you couldn't even tell what it was.. 
They forgot to ask what we wanted to drink.. then we told them at the window.. but had to remind them again to give them to us.. gave us one straw with the 2 drinks.. got Dr Pepper in both but they were flat.. everyone in the place seemed confused..

Green beans were ok
Ate several French fries then got mold taste.. powered through it hoping it was a small bad part of a potatoe had several more fries until I got another mouthful of mold taste second time was so bad I had to spit it out..

Biscuits were good!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience of my life. The food was good but the employees and the wait time was horrible. This location is always short staffed while the drive through line is wrapped around the restaurant. The staff have no sense of urgency and don't care about customer service. I will never be back. I would rather go to El Pollo Loco where I don't have to wait long and the chicken is bomb."}

hot & spicy chicken was good, buscuits are the bomb.(they forgot the butter) (and forgot my pies) red beans & rice is good & spicy. corn sucked-cold and undercooked. better than kfc & churchs but still fast food
chicken was good & hot but service & screwing up my order cost them"}
{"text":"I asked what the kids meal consisted of and the counter girl just stared at me like I was an alien.   She asks the manager and they mumble back and forth then stare at me.

Drove 30 minutes home drop my friend off and now I'm ready to dig into my 3 piece chicken strip combo and the strips are so small it's ridiculous. One is so thin is like a piece of bacon that's been batter-dipped and fried. I call back to explain to the store manager at David and he seem very nonchalant about it, as if it happens all the time, or nothing's wrong. Very disappointed in the service and the quality of the meal ridiculous. Now I can see why you guys have a 2 as a rating"}

{"text":"I'm going to stop ordering sweet tea at places that only have the lemon juice packets.

Other than that, it's Popeye's; love the spicy chicken and sides."}
{"text":"The only reason they got a star was because that was the lowest option. During our order the counter person mostly stopped visiting long enough to get our order wrong. Then informed us both our cards didn't work because we didn't have money. We gave her another card, she said \"that card doesn't have money either\". We informed her it was a problem with the machine and asked her to try again. She instead sent us to another register but neglected to tell the other person or give her our order.  When we asked why our order wasn't transferred between machines the new counter person she told us they don't do that she can ask the other employee or we can just order again. We ended up walking out and eating somewhere else. The manager did offer us the meal for free but when we told her what her first employee said to us she actually said \"what the f**k, oh my god I'm so sorry\" I've never been so insulted by anyone. And if I didn't have the $20 for lunch I wouldn't have gone in. We asked the manager give the free meal to someone in need and went on our way. I know it's a fast food restaurant but I'm not willing to be treated poorly just because I felt like eating out while holiday shopping."}
{"text":"Chubby girl at window was quite possibly the rudest person ever. Not sure if they trained her on how to interact with customers but she was difficult to speak to.  Didnt catch her name."}
{"text":"While eating, I saw a trail of ants crawling around the window and on the wall.  Immediately I went to get the manager on duty, Ms. Marnessa,  but was told she was busy.  She never came out to the lobby so I could show her.  Twice I went to the counter to ask Ms. Marnessa to come to the see the ants, but ...  She wasn't to busy to go outside for a period of time to talk.  Watch out for ants if you eat inside!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a typical Popeyes. Most of the time, service is good and the food comes out great. I only come on Tuesdays for the 2 for $1.29 special (formerly 99 cents). I go to this location whenever I come from I-15.

It's your typical fast food joint, except it's fried chicken. The only bad thing I can say about this place is on Tuesdays, it gets so crowded because of the special. Even the drive-thru gets backed up.

I suggest getting chicken early to mid afternoon, before 4-5 pm when people come home and pick up their dinner. The chicken tastes better (more recently cooked) and you beat having to wait due to the rush.

From what I've seen, the staff is always hard working, especially on Tuesdays. Whenever I ask for hot sauce, I get it. They're always busy so there's none of that happy greeting when you walk in stuff, but it's not like I come for that. I come for the cheap and good chicken on Tuesdays. As long as that status quo is maintained, I'll keep coming."}
{"text":"If you move to rude ass cashiers and a messy dining area that never gets clean; come on down.  Enjoy the looks of indifference on your cashier's face as you bother them with your business. But hey, at least the food is standard Popeyes fair."}
{"text":"This is such a shame, super busy new location and the service was good until the grand opening period was over. Now all orders are incorrect, sides missing, wrong items pulled...how hard can it be to fill the orders? Went in last night and the seven people in front of me as well as me, had to take their orders back to the counter to be corrected, what a waste of product and money. This is totally a management problem."}
{"text":"We were really craving some fried chicken and mac and cheese, but wanted it fast and didn't want to wait at a restaurant. Popeye's surprised me - delicious! It was so good, I went 3 times in the past two weeks. I used the drive through and my order was always correct, hot and fresh. The last round the drive thru gal tossed in a little hot sauce cup that had a puncture in it, so the sauce got everywhere, which was annoying. I actually preferred Popeye's over Raising Cane's, but then I found out it's loaded with MSG. I knew it was too good to be true :( Sadly, I won't be going back because of that, but if you don't mind MSG, all I have to say is...yuuummmm."}
{"text":"Jan 20, 2016 - Stopped by tonight for dinner for the family. Could not hear or understand the lady on the drive thru speaker. The guy at the window couldn't care less. Very poor customer service. And when we got home to eat, the chicken was cold. Totally disappointed. I don;t know who owns this one, but its in pretty bad shape for a new location."}
{"text":"Felt like some chicken, so I went here for dinner. I've been to this location before but tonight it was terrible. I ordered a 3 piece combo. 5 minutes later, I was told they're out of biscuits, do I want an extra side instead ? 

My 1 star review is based on the chicken. My combo was supposed to come with a wing, drumstick, and thigh. The pieces were incredibly small. I swear the drumstick was more like a wing drumette. I really think that's what I got. The leg bone was like 2.5 inches long. And the meat on the wing was dried out. The thigh was scrawny too. The red beans and rice were good, so was the coleslaw. But the chicken sucked. I still can't believe how small the pieces were. I'm never going to Popeyes again."}
{"text":"It's rare I give fast food 5 Stars but they did it. Big fan of their food but this store gave us 5-Star customer service thru drive thru. Professional, courteous and friendly."}

Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought drive thru was suppose to be a bit quicker than walking into the store?? Smh just horrible..."}
{"text":"5 stars for this location. I always drive all the way from Mississauga to this amazing location. Always fresh and clean place."}

I sit in your drive thru for 15 minutes for a simple box.. then my order is wrong, I come inside you have employees blowing their nose then going straight to touch some food, shouldn't even be open in business still honestly!! Health department needs to check you guys out. & the manager sucks no wonder why the associates are angry"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to this location, and I come here a lot. The chicken is usually pretty fresh (still crispy and not soaked in oil) and things are ready relatively quickly. There's been a few times when my order was slightly wrong, like giving me Cajun rice instead of red beans and rice, but nothing major. The interior and the bathrooms were clean and the cashiers are friendly for the most part. I've only used the drive-through once and that was pretty quick and easy, too."}
{"text":"They are super disgusting! Served 4 hour old Cajun Rice that was green and white mold"}
{"text":"Horrible never knew customer service can be so bad. The red beans and rice was runny."}
{"text":"Great service, Fast, and oh so good. Right when we walked in we were immediately greeted by the employees with Welcome back to Popeyes. There were a few people ahead of us ordering, but it took only a few minutes for our turn. We ordered the three and five piece chicken strip meals mild spice with mashed potatoes. I also ordered a side of coleslaw. My husband tried their original chicken but hot. We were given our drink cups and a number for our table. Literally before we sat down our food was ready and brought to us. It was hot, fresh, and the coleslaw was amazing. Most places water it down so much, but it was perfect. The chicken was juicy and had an awesome flavor. Every table was full and all the employees were smiling and welcoming. We literally got one of the very last open tables. They also gave my son a balloon which made his day. The parking lot is a little difficult to manage since it is so new and not only have a ton of cars in the drive thru..there are also still work trucks everywhere.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We initially asked for an order of 6 piece chicken tenders but then decided we wanted 12 & told the cashier that we wanted an order of 12 piece chicken TENDERS. We ended up receiving an order of 12 piece wings instead. I had no idea that \"we want an order of chicken tenders\" was such a hard  phrase to comprehend because tenders and wings don't sound similar AT ALL. The receipt even says \"chicken TENDERS\" 

If you can't take the customer's order properly or at least read the order correctly, why even work at the location???"}
{"text":"This Popeyes gets busy and it's because it's a pretty good location. The biscuits are great at this location in particular. The chicken strips were fresh. However, the owner might consider adding additional staff. The current staff is friendly, however."}
{"text":"BEST fast food restaurant! Popeyes is always good and this location is one of the best I've been too. The staff were patient and accurate with a big order and everything was made fresh. The place was clean and everything tasted great. Crispy, spicy, fresh and flavourful. 
Overall a good location and a must try."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend come here often but after being \"greeted\" by the super rude employees that were there, never again will we come again. We were short like $5 because essentially we tried paying with a card but it was put on hold for theft purposes so we gathered any cash we had and they employees did not try to help us or even let us come back and pay(we live down the street), they were being rude because we weren n the phone trying to unlock it just so we could pay and rolled their eyes at us. On top of this our order was WRONG! Hopefully management can fix this issue"}
{"text":"Popeye's has always been a favorite fast food place but im used to seeing them in airports and highway reat areas. This was different. It was a free standing restaurant that was clean, well lit and (for a fast food restaurant) nicely decorated. The staff on the day we were there (Wednesday October 22) was helpful, made suggestions,  pegged us for northerners and explained Jambalaya to my wife. The menu board with rotating photos helped get us to order more than we needed.  Overall a great Popeye's."}
{"text":"I LOVE Popeye's Chicken, it is the best fast food chicken joint there is IMHO.  This location is terrible.  They have forgotten my side twice now (I keep going back cause they're the closest) and when my BF was ordering dinner the other day, there were four people ahead of him complaining about missing items or wrong orders.  If they run out of an item they will either leave it out or substitute it without telling you (they were out of breasts and gave the person a thigh).  *Always* check your order before leaving the parking lot.  The food is good, just bad service."}
{"text":"Hit or miss with this Popeyes. I live down the street from this location so I go every so often. There has been times where they have got my order wrong. They make you park in front most of the time which can be annoying. The customer service is good, they are nice people. They just can become very slow at completing orders. The food is ok, not too special. A average Popeyes at best."}
{"text":"Popeyes Chicken is not gourmet food, nor is it healthy, or even very clean. So I feel a bit guilty as I admit my craving for it and can't in honesty give it a gourmet 5 stars.

However, it has GOOD fried chicken and to die for buttery heart-attack biscuits. The chicken is crispy and juicy. The biscuits fall apart in your hands and melt in your mouth. 

And it's cheap - $4.99 gets you 3 pieces of juicy chicken and 1 biscuit. I was full after 2 pieces but managed to finish the 3rd piece. 

My name is Catherine and I'm addicted to Popeyes fried chicken."}
{"text":"Finally a Popeye's in a decent location!  Great service and clean facilities.  Food is the usual Popeye's brand no complaints whatsoever.  Staff is quick and friendly.  Ample parking in the plaza where it's located."}
{"text":"Slowest Popeyes's ever! And never fails every time I come here they always forget my sauce! Tenders without sauce really."}
{"text":"Popeyes hands down has the yummiest fried wings. It is so juicy and hot, I also get their spicy buffalo sauce :) only complaint is u feel fat and yucky after eating it as it's prob filled with preservatives and msg"}
{"text":"The one star is an over rate for this place!! We used to go here and love it, but each time we have gone the past few times it keeps deteriorating in quality, service and quantity!
This evening was the last straw, I ordered a 8 piece strips chicken, a large mashed potatoes and gravy, large macaroni and cheese and small French fry - What I got was 6 regular size strips of chicken and 2 fragment's of chicken (see photos) one large cup with about 3/4 Of it full both the potatoes and Mac n cheese and a large box of cold fries - The service girls were rude as well"}
{"text":"Just another fast food restaurant staffed by kids who don't care about thier job or customers.  Ordered the 5 piece finger meal and I received 5 nuggets that that if you put them together might equal 2 fingers. A cold lump for a biscuit and the wrong side that I ordered. Since I went to the drive-thru I didn't get any utensils or receipt and the Sprite I ordered was out of syrup. So basically a loss all the way around and for $10.05 do yourself a favor and pass on this location there are other Popeyes you actually care about what they serve"}
{"text":"I have always LOVED popeyes chicken and shrimp.  Good thing they all have the same flavor otherwise this location would be out of business already. Just based on the managers attitude I would guess the food would most likely match his personality. . . Straight BS. He is the worst. If you don't tell him right off what flavor and sides he just assumes your order for you. A 5$ mild tender box with mashed potatoes and fries will turn into spicy leg and thigh with beans and corn before you can get a receipt. Like I said the manager is a douch bag in disguise."}
{"text":"I really would like to be able to go to this location and get a fresh meal every time and correct order. But like a Las vegas casino, the odds are against you. More like 20/80."}
{"text":"Do not eat the chicken. I went with 5 people around 1:00 P.M. I had a po boy sandwich it was lukewarm and not very good. Corporate needs to get in here before this grand opening becomes a grand closing. Stay safe with the red beans and rice."}
{"text":"Look, there hasn't been a review of this Popeyes for awhile. This location was absolutely wonderful. The food was hot and fresh. The people working there were super nice, even after my 6 year old spilled her drink by the Coke machine. The restaurant is super clean and well organized. We came downtown from about 40 minutes away and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been stalking this place for a while, every time I come near this place the line is crazy so I end up eating something else.  I guess today was my day the line wasn't that bad, got through it pretty fast they seemed to be efficient with the order process by taking my name and repeating the order to me, however after getting the food they put a wrong side in the box, but the line was so long at this point I just let it go and moved on. The food I got was pretty good hotter than I expected but pretty good. Every one else enjoyed their food, so the experience was a pretty good one. Although I must say the biscuits were small I wish they were a little bigger because they were awesome."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of too many fast food restaurants, don't get me wrong I'm def not the healthiest eater as I do love to indulge but when I do fast food Popeyes is usually on the top of my list.

This location in particular is my absolute favorite though and I'm pretty sure I've been to most if not all in the GTA. It's always clean and rarely do I find a large line however it is always busy being the only Popeyes for miles. Lots of seating is available my only real complaint would be the parking lot which is located at the back of restaurant and is very small with limited space. 

The service is always on par here, they are usually fast and pleasant rarely making any mistakes I've noticed in all the time I've been going visiting.  All Popeyes do have my very FAVORITE coleslaw in the world, It's ridiculous how much I love the stuff!! It's some kind of creamy dill with carrots but I always upsize and order the large 

When it comes to fast food restaurants this place really sets the mark and as for Popeyes it is hands down my fav location so far"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my dinner here with 10 pics of chicken for 19.99. Very good deal! The staffs were pretty nice."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong.. Love the food, the food is obviously amazing, but I am not happy with the customer service. One night I went in and ordered the 8 piece family meal (to go) with 1 large side and 4 biscuits. When I arrived home, I was only given 7 pieces of chicken, instead of 8. It may not seem like a big deal, but it sucks if it's something you paid for. Let me give you an example.. It's friday night, you just had a long busy day at work, all you want to do is relax, eat some food and get the long weekend started. Now Imagine you ordered a pizza delivered to your house, you give the driver his 30 bucks including tip and hes gone. You open up the pizza, and you notice 1 slice of pizza is gone! Wouldn't that piss you off and be like wtf!? You are going to do something about that right?! So I called the place (I believe I was speaking to the manager) and let him know. He asked for my order # which would be on the receipt. He said without the receipt, their is nothing he can do for me. Well that sucks, because I was never given a receipt when I orginally made my purchase!!! I am 100% positive that I was never given a receipt. He took my order and gave me all my food right on the spot, it was really quick. Anyways, he basically did not believe me, was being totally rude, and was trying to argue with me on the phone. Why would I lie about something like this? I've worked many years in the customer service industry, and I would of handled it totally different. You know how much chicken these guys make? Just give me my damn 1 piece of chicken, and make me a happy customer! Or at least something to make sure I am satisfied with the service. Now due to this poor service, I am writing this negative review on Yelp, when it could of been a positive one instead. Obviously saving one piece of chicken is far more important than customer satisfaction. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"We went here around 9pm, i love fried chicken so i decided to have a popeyes. While we are looking at the menu (driving thru) he decided to give us a attitude, when my husband said \"ok we are ready!\" He said what do you want? With rude tone of voice. We tried to get some sweets and he said \"we dont have that\" Until we got to the window to pay and grab my chicken. He never ever say thank u or anything. He didnt Even told us how much! when i opened my box it was DRY CHICKEN WITH A SMALL DRUM STICK CHICKEN. He was wearing blue polo shirt so i assume he is the manager if im not wrong. I have never had services like this. Im from japan and i am very very disappointed in america when it comes to costomer service. i will never ever going back to that popeyes. Keep ur moody attitude rudeness to yourself when u are working costomer services."}
{"text":"I love coming here on 2 piece Tuesdays ! You get two pieces for 99 cents! I typically buy $10.00 worth for the week for every ones lunches. It comes in handy when I'm dog tired from work and don't feel like cooking. The best way to save is to make  the sides at home. I'll usually pair it with rice,  mashed potatoes, or we will bake some Pillsbury biscuits at home. It's a nice solid meal but it's best to get there early because the lines can get crazy!"}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try as it was a new location for months now.  Sorry, we did it was busy (not when we got there), chicken was overdone (dry), fry's were cold there were no condiments to be found.  We had to go up and ask for EVERYTHING nothing was handy.  There was plenty work staff, just lazyn' around.  Probably won't go here again.

TRY ANOTHER LOCATION if it's Popeye's your hungry for !!!!"}
{"text":"Well we should of payed more attention to the AWFUL reviews prior to this !! YES, we had a TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.  When we entered the restaurant there was no one except for us there, there must of been without kidding 20 plus employees having their own party among themselves, a massive amount of chicken already prepared, ready for the dinner rush and GETTING COLD as it lay.  We both ordered (my husband) wanting to try their new peppered chicken (WHAT A JOKE) his was less hot then my mild chicken tenders... He had to add louisana hot sauce to make it alittle spicey.

The restaurant was FREEZING, we both wore our jackets the whole time we were there, it was by far warmer outdoors... We mentioned it to a couple people in the back (THE ONLY ANSWER WE GOT) was that- was why they were dressed for a blizzard !! NO concern whatsoever.

My husband mentioned about the chicken with no different taste then the regular tenders (mild at that) OH well, that's how they come???????WHAT....???

My tenders were luke warm at best when I recieved them.  I just ate them, we were already.......upset that we chose this place instead of JUST ANY OTHER !!! at this point so upset.

SO TAKE MY ADVICE............LOOK AT ALL THESE 1 STAR REVIEWS BEFORE YOU ENTER........CHOOSE ANOTHER ANY OTHER I MIGHT ADD...EATING CHOICE."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money I spent 18.72 include 1.00 extra for a extra large drink.. This was a 4pcs combo... When I went to get a refill they said 86 cent... REALLY"}
{"text":"The Popeyes fried chicken is total crap but I love their Chicken Fingers!! The Buffalo Sauce that comes with it is absolutely delicious to my tastebuds! The guy behind the counter was miserable by the way! I'd do this again!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight and they didn't have spicy strips....okay I'll get mild. Pull up to the window and ask for ranch and homegirl with the bun and glasses says \"we don't have no sauce\" I said \"you don't have any sauce, how does that work? You opened two weeks ago??\". They didn't have ranch, BBQ, OR HONEY!!! How are you a fried chicken joint with no honey and you opened two weeks ago????? She gave no explanation and didn't apologize or try and accommodate the situation. The girls at the window looked clueless, were rude, and not friendly AT ALL. Had to go to McDonalds just to get some ranch and BBQ sauce. Get it together Popeyes!!!!"}
{"text":"The wings were sooo small. The jambalaya was dry and the biscuit old. Stay away from this place especially the cajun wings"}
{"text":"It's Christmas Day 2016 and this Popeyes is super busy.  I give five stars because all the workers here have the best attitudes I've ever come across.  Smiles from all.  They are wishing everyone a \"Merry Christmas\".  

We had a slight issue with our order and they apologized with no questions asked or attitude.  There is a young man named Chris that is making sure everything is clean out at the seating area.  He's asking people how their meal is and being so customer service excellent!"}
{"text":"Totes awkward. Waited in the drive thru for 15 minutes for 3 tenders. Told us $8.79 at the window. Gave her exact change. Got them, started driving away, she yelled we gave her an extra 23 cents... But we gave her exact change. So we told her to keep it. Noticed I got 3 hella dry wings instead of my 3 spicy tenders.. Instead of waiting in the drive thru again, I went inside to encounter a super awkward situation where the lady working looks like she wants to eat a gun and the lady in front of me is just standing there not ordering.. Just chillin. So I walk up and say my order was kinda wrong and apologized. And the lady gives me hella crazy eyes and says she hasn't ordered yet. Shooooooot. Eventually lady on suicide watch takes my box, dramatically drops my chicken into the trash can with half of my delicious Cajun fries, and gives me new chicken. I didn't even want to ask for ranch; I just got the heck out of there. Favorite food, least favorite location."}
{"text":"sorriest Popeye's on the planet, sorriest fast food place on the planet period.  im at the drive threw trying to order, someone left their headset on so you can hear everything going on in there.  you can hear people arguing and cursing.  when they finally ask me for my order, i ask them for the 3 peice meal and they respond back, \"we have no chicken so you jus gonna have to order our non chicken meals\".  seemed like it was a lot of unsupervised kids working  there just out of control.  a damn mess.  after getting attitude and the worst help, i asked to speak to a manager, surprise, i was talking to her all along.  a damn shame when the ghetto takes over your store and runs it into the ground."}
{"text":"Came in 10 minutes before close, Melissa and John were extremely courteous and took care of me! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not particularly impressed with the quality of service at this location 

Their menu style is a bit confusing so it took us a while to unstand how they work. When we told them all we wanted to fries & chicken , they calculated it for us but after ordering we realized they could've easily offered us a combo menu for 40cents more for the drink fries & biscuit

When we ordered spicy, they told us they didn't have it and offered us mild instead of offering to make a fresh batch.

They also forgot to provide us with sauces.

Truthfully I doubt I will be returning unless I come back on a daily special day. Ideally when they are making that item with a high turnaround."}
{"text":"This location has issues. Rolled up at 5:30, looking to purchase 12 piece family meal, mild. Couldn't fill the order. Only had 3 pieces of mild? 5:30pm at a chicken restaurant doesn't have enough chicken?  Insane. Love Popeyes, won't be back to this one."}
{"text":"First time in years we tried Popeyes. That chicken has flavor! The sides were good. 
Only thing is they didn't put sauces in bag as requested- What's a tender with no Ranch? Sadly we found out when we got home....."}
{"text":"Shitty service. Probably because they have a shitty lead. First time here. Wasn't busy at all and wasn't acknowledged by the cashier or cooks. Acted as if we weren't here. Sad business. Let's see if it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I have been to the place 2 times and each time once I leave the drive thru window my order is always have been wrong. Why is that the hardes thing for them not sure if it's the mic that they can not hear inside the store but what ever the problem is they really need to get it right. I will try again 3 strikes your out."}
{"text":"Extremely bad attitude. Just went in- no customers were there. No staff were available at the counter. There were 03 staff in the kitchen but ignored us completely. Will never try this place again"}
{"text":"Food was alright just found it ridiculous that they charge you a buck for a refill.  Especially after I done spent $27 on lunch for two.  That is pretty weak."}
{"text":"Very polite workers.  They asked if I wanted to buy an apple pie, I told them no cause they forgot to give them to me last time.  I left work my food and they threw in three pies for free.  Nice to see employees who care.  (Biscuits seem to be overbaked)"}
{"text":"Experience:  NEEDED some chicken....specifically Popeyes. There are no better Popeyes the the ones in Louisiana, but sometimes a girl's gotta take what she can get. 
I hit the drive thru, but was nervous the food and service would be bad when I drove up, because it was empty, and there were so many bad reviews about this spot. 
But I had the opposite experience. The staff were very friendly and polite. The Food came out quick. I ordered a 2 piece with red beans and rice and mashed potatoes and coleslaw. They did mess up my order and gave me 2 red beans instead of mash potatoes, but I wasn't upset because I love the red beans and rice the most of their sides. Although, it was a bit watery this time. Other than that, the chicken was hot and fresh, the biscuit was the same!  The sides were yummy and no complaints here. 
Not as good as back home, but still good fast food."}
{"text":"I visit this location once a week, on my way to school. Usually, around 4pm. I order the same thing each time (chicken strips, biscuit), so I cant comment on the quality of all of their menu items, but their chicken strips are amazing. The biscuit is a little dry but most biscuits are so no complaints there. The food is always super fresh. Ive never had a stale biscuit or a cold piece of chicken here!

I have also tried their fries and they are pretty good. The staff - I have interacted with several of them - are always very friendly and professional. Hopefully Im not jinxing myself haha but every visit has been perfect so far!"}
{"text":"Hopelessly disappointed in the South Boulevard location.  Just as soon as Popeye's runs an ad for a \"limited time special\" I run over to this location to take part.  Most recently (this has happened three times) I asked for the $4 wicked chicken combo.  Admittedly it's a pretty good deal.  A bunch of chicken strips, fries and a biscuit for $4.  I went there yesterday (4/24/18).  As soon as I walked in, I ordered my $4 wicked chicken (which was plastered all over their HDTV menu boards) and I was told, \"we don't have that.\"  I said, \"but it's all over your menu board and I saw the commercial TODAY.  So how could it possibly be unavailable?  She said, \"it was a limited time promotion,\"  Clearly it was a limited time promotion.  Like it was cancelled within the 30 minutes it took them to broadcast it and then let me arrive so I could buy something else.  GFY Popeyes.  There is a term for this and it's called BAIT and SWITCH and I left with nothing.  And I won't be back.  I am sure you don't care but Chic-Fil-A didn't become the chicken success story it is by treating customers poorly.  Krispy Krunchy Chicken is WAY better anyway.  Make sure you visit those locations off WT Harris Blvd and Monroe Road in Charlotte.  They are much friendlier and don't cancel your special while on your way there.  I won't be back Popeyes.  You lost a customer for life."}
{"text":"Much longer drive through time than I've ever had to endure here before, but they were extremely polite and added some extra sides to my order for my wait.  Food was very freshly made (very very hot) and was excellent."}
{"text":"Mistake of my life!!! I'm in the drive thru now and have been so for the past 42 minutes! Stuck between cars and can't get out of line to go home!!!!!!!! Don't come to this location, I'd rather sleep hungry than buy food here!!!!!"}
{"text":"1) Stale fries
2) Watery gravy
3) Ketchup packs were all nasty because i guess sauce spilled all over it

i've been to wayyyyy better popeyes!"}
{"text":"I dont frequent Popeyes because Im vegetarian and the menu is very limited. Today I went through their drive thru before I hit the highway. I ordered red beans & rice with a side of fries. They didnt even have any ketchup for my fries. Now, lets be honest: some people couldnt care less about ketchup. That is a very small margin of people. The majority of french fry loving Americans prefer ketchup as a chaser. How do you run out of ketchup? That's like taking a road trip & running put of gas."}
{"text":"Got the Tuesday special,the chicken is crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside,line moved quickly, got my food even faster.   Overall great experience"}
{"text":"Don't expect this crappy location to have honey in stock. If they do, the employees are too lazy to look for it when you ask anyway."}
{"text":"guy was a smart ass this time. i tried ordering two different things and they ran out of them so when i asked well what do you have? he replied with ..... \"chicken.\" ?!%#%^ don't expect them to make anything fresh if they run out seems like once it's gone it's gone"}
{"text":"Red beans and rice and Cajun fries were wonderful! Got the po'boy sandwich which was different. Not bad different, just different. Employees were very nice. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Seriously if I could give negative stars I would. The only reasons I come to this shit hole is because the food is great! How is it that the week is not ended and it is dinner time and you dont have refills for your beverages and you ALAWYS RUN OUT OF CHICKEN!!! This is popeyes Louisiana Kitchen and all you sell is chicken. Every lunch or dinner rush you run out of the ONLY DAMN THING YOU SELL! Then you tell them what you want in the drive through and they are laughing with their DUMB ASS FRIENDS! it is so annoying that this is the only Popeys that is close to my house. Most of the time I drive an extra 10 miles just to avoid the shitty customer service at this one. I can go on for days about how terrible the service is here. I think you understand where I am coming from. 1 more thing why do they ALWAYS SCREW UP YOUR ORDER! YOU HAVE ONE JOB!"}
{"text":"Worst ever!  My mom and I went for lunch and ended up with food poisoning. I'd say that sums it up. *eat at your own risk*  They don't even deserve 1 star.  The serve was good."}
{"text":"Bought chicken today for dinner waited 15-20 mins to get our order. Kids are hungry When we get home just found out that the chickhen is not cook properly call the store and tell the guy who answer the phone about it and he was like maybe just veins and i told him i'm a cook so i know if its cook or not. The guy is like did you guys eat it we put it on timer so it will cook the way it should be so i answer him yes the small pieces but the big pieces are the ones thats not cook properly  and he answer me i can't do anything about it but my manager can but he's not here you can call tomorrow. 

Won't buy there again.... very disappointed"}
{"text":"Customer service is horrible. Every time I visit I have to repeat myself repeatedly about my order...someone either is short with me in drive thru or does not prepare my order the right way. Tonight topped the cake a manager took my order and placed what sides they thought I should have without any options. I will visit and leave a review every time I visit and if this continue I will report next to corporate about this establishment and their service."}
{"text":"This is the coldest restaurant ever. Fix your thermostat.  Bring a jacket, or go through the drive thru."}
{"text":"The staff wasn't friendly.There were big garbage bags left in the middle of the restaurant. The washrooms sent clean. The employees were very loud . 
How ever the food was good . Served warm  and fast"}
{"text":"Food was great but the employees were incredibly rude; one was even a manager. They were extremely condescending as I was asking questions about an item on the menu. 
This isn't my first time at Popeyes, it's one of my favorite places to eat, but it's definitely been my least pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This place has gotten better since my last review. The quality of the chicken is great, and the spicy chicken is quite addictive. They always have specials and different limited flavors. The service is standard for fast food."}
{"text":"Popeye's really is the best fast food restaurant in Madison. They are surely better than 3 stars but I don't give those out very easily. 

Their chicken is typically served hot. While there have been times I've gotten take out from them and was given dry pieces of chicken, I have always been able to call of the GM (who's been here since they first opened years ago), tell him my problem with my meal and would be ask to return to get a fresh batch without charge. They would even throw in extra biscuits for our troubles, however, I do not want to say that is the norm. This has only been a problem 2-3 times in my years of experiences dining with them. 

Recently, they redecorated the interior. It looks fantastic. Very modern day feel that is inviting. Plenty of seating area, very clean including the bathrooms, and good young staff ( from what I can tell). Because I am a very picky eater, I only order their chicken strips. I don't like chicken with the skin and bone still attached. My strips are 100% white meat ( bonus, don't eat dark meat) and are extremely crispy. When you bite into them, you can hear the crunch! Whatever batter they use is excellent! Unlike their competitor who's chicken is often very greasy and fatty, you can tell Popeye's uses quality chicken and batter. 

You're offered a variety of side dishes such as their signature red beans and rice ( be warned, it contains pork), mash potatoes and gravy ( also has pork in the gravy), mac n cheese, cole slaw and seasoned fries. You also served a fresh warm biscuit. My goodness, their biscuits are so addicting! I have to contain myself whenever I dine at Popeyes because I could at a good 2-3 biscuits. There is not questions that they use a  buttermilk dough. It makes the biscuits soft. They add butter on top of the biscuits once taken out of the oven. Perfection.


They stay busy which means, you're going to get freshly made food since they must keep up with demand. I love this place. Also, Tuesday's is half price chicken! Dark meat only ( bummer)."}
{"text":"Really bad service, food doesn't taste like chicken at all. I saw new Indian workers has no clue what they were doing. I think cheap Franchise Indian running the show. Get away from this place and find really food somewhere else. Not recommend to spend your valuable hungry money."}
{"text":"I really like Popeye's, just not this location. Food was served cold. The fries were hard. Could crack them in half. Ordered the shrimp basket. Should have known better. It was horrible. Thick breaded fried shrimp tastes horrible when served cold. The biscuits were hard. If you want sauce, be sure to ask for it. Also make sure your order is correct before you drive away. Did not bother calling to complain. They could probably care less about my complaint."}
{"text":"So it's 5 pm on a Tuesday night and this small Popeyes is crowded.  Why the crowd...there is no Mild Chicken and very little Spicy.  No Spicy breasts and the wait is 18 minutes for Spicy breasts and 17 minutes for any Mild.  Now how's that for planning.  I opted for all dark meat because I didn't not have time to wait.  Also ordered 2 large Cajun rice.  Takeout of course.  Most of the chicken was fine but a couple of drumsticks were so old and dried up they were probably leftover from Sunday.  Yes, that how old they looked and tasted.  As for the Cajun Rice, a large size is $3.99 so I was not happy when I opened the containers and found that they were less than 3/4 filled.  All most all of the rice could have fit in one container.  To say that I was not happy would be an understatement.  Next time I will go to Albertsons.  Their 8 piece is always fresh and very reasonable."}
{"text":"Everybody be aware the Popeyes chicken on flamingo and Maryland Parkway is doing something to customers food.  I guess I had to give them one star to post they don't deserve my dogs shit"}
{"text":"Look at all of these 1 star reviews!  That really says something.  My situation is that I went to this location and was given an incomplete and wrong order.  I order original chicken and was given spicy.  I also ordered an extra large side and was only given one.  When I go to call them there's no number listed.  I sent 2 complaints via their website and left my number for someone to call me back and both times nothing.  I did not get what I paid for and someone else got to benefit from me ordering another large side.  I haven't been back since.  They have horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. The food is very consistently good. Unfortunately the staff and service are no where close. It seems like you are inconveniencing them when you walk in. The restaurant or washrooms are usually dirty and they are slow. I will reluctantly come here again until i find another Popeyes I'm willing to drive to."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION, Franchise needs BETTER MANAGEMENT AT THIS LOCATION.    I love the Popeye's franchise and it's sad to have one so close to my house only to have inconsistent service and food quality.  Every time I tell myself I will never go back...I do and to my dismay...angered and upset.  Best advice being a FORMER avid fan...Stay Away. Drive to another location. Sad for the franchise."}
{"text":"1. My account was charged twice? tried calling the store to speak to a manger, no answer. I don't have time with work and the kids/kids school to go to the actual location. Plus they weren't very nice. $69  for popeyes? I don't think so. I also didn't get 2 items that I ordered and I paid extra? 

2. Went through the drive through. I was advise to park my car in front and wait due to they ran out of chicken. okay I understand. I waited more than 25 minutes. I was told 15 minutes. I understood they were busy. Unloaded my4  kids and a 6 month old baby who was peacefully sleeping out of the car whom woke up right after I closed my car door to find out the food was done and that \"they couldn't find my car\". Well I parked in the only parking spot available. Near the gas station door and if he actually looked at every car he would of seen that I had my window rolled down, see my face and recognized me. That's if he recognizes every customer that goes through the drive through. But I watched the entrance door the entire time to see when they would come out. No one did. So how can they see my car if no one attempted to bring my food out like they said they would. 

3. Staff is rude. Short with their words. Too busy laughing and goofing around through the drive through speaker. Couldn't understand anything 


I would give this location a Zero if I could. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"If I can rate this place 0 stars I would... Literally waited an hour in the drive through for just a 3 piece. Enough said.."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love me some fried chicken and Popeyes has always been my favorite. I think I was spoiled because I came from the South, and we take our chicken and work ethic seriously there. My hubby and I went through the drive thru yesterday.   The line was long, but that's ok because it usually is at Popeyes. The wait was a little longer than I like, but I got excited because I thought that meant the chicken would be fresh. I ordered a 3 piece all white meal and a 5 piece tenders meal. I noticed the price was a little higher than I usually pay, but like I said this is a different area. There was also an up charge for all white meat which is ok. The kid at the window was very nice and polite. I know they were busy, but when we got home the first thing I saw was no silverware. That was fine for the tenders and fries, but not for the red beans and rice. No biggie, I have forks but if I hadn't been at home it may be an issue. Next, the tenders were small!  And I had one wing, a thigh, and drumstick in my all white meal with the white meat upcharge!!!  Plus, it wasn't fresh...it hadn't turned into a rock yet but it was on its way. And this cost us $23. I will try them again because it's so close to my house and pray to Jesus it was a one time mess up. Cause like I said, I usually LOVE Popeyes. If not, I guess I will get it once every year or so when I visit family in Alabama and Florida."}
{"text":"I hate refried chicken. Everytime i go there chicken is never fresh. Gonna go across the street at KFC hopefully a better place."}
{"text":"Ok, it's a fried chicken chain and its attached to a gas station... There are so many things wrong with this... But the food is good and slightly addicting! Im in love with the spicy chicken po' boy... It calls to me at night! You must try one...

As far sa the resturant goes its surprisingly clean and the staff is really friendly. If there is anything to complain about its that the parking lot is small and can fill up quick."}
{"text":"For what it is it's expensive. Not that it's not good. Just over price. Not to mention there is a KFC right down the street. The place is clean and it's a great location to have a chicken place. The service is what you would expect from a fast food. Also I think the portion size could be a little bigger (once again overpriced). So with out being more repetitive I'm done."}
{"text":"Haven't been here before, customer service was good, the girl at the counter was friendly. Our food was hot, crispy and flavorful chicken, biscuits were a little hard, the mash potatoes were a little overwhelming I'm not to sure if I like the gravy, it's not bad... It's just different. The Mac and cheese and Cajun fries all good. I'd go back."}
{"text":"OMG I was about to bite into my food and this massive nasty mosquito or flying grasshopper flew out of the bag! wth gross im go back to get a refund & she said I had to call in the morning because the system was down at 11pm."}
{"text":"everytime we go to this location the staff seems more confused than they were the visit prior .. convenience of the location & food quality overall keeps us returning .. but we NEVER do the drive thru .. it takes way too long & our order is always incorrect .. so we go inside to at least get the order correct but the staff at that counter is confused & unprofessional .. the bathrooms always stink & the staff uses a booth in the dining room as their own personal flop house .. odd that the food is so good when everything else is so bad"}
{"text":"love coming here every tuesday. they have a special 2 pieces for 99 cents. and the fried chicken is the best, crispy and tasty. we usually get the chicken with jalapeno.................. yummy....... oh by the way the crawfish was not so good."}
{"text":"Love Popeyes, but this location is the worst one I have ever been to. Both ice machines empty, old biscuits, I tried the tea and I am sure it wasn't made today.  Only two other customers but yet tables are dirty, trash over flowing.  Its after 3:00 pm, plenty of employees (6) here to take care of the neglected dinning areas and restock, but they stand behind the counter playing grabass with each other.   I wish there was an option for zero stars.  Do not recommend this location."}
{"text":"This place has terrible service. They constantly mess up orders and don't acknowledge customers that walk in. I waited for ten minutes before walking out of the place. They have employees walking around the store on break and managers casually walking inside but no service to even take my order let alone make it. Just before I walked out I heard the cashier who didn't ring me up tell another customer that they were out of fries. This place blows. My view of this Popeye's has massively decreased and I don't recommend anyone go here. Go to Canes just around the corner and buy from employees that care to give semi-good service."}
{"text":"Horrible service! This is probably why all reviews are negative. I've been waiting 15 minutes for someone to basically put food in a box! The girl at the register is not properly trained and I highly suggest management does a sweep of getting rid of the ignorant uneducated people asap!"}
{"text":"They used to have a decent portion of chicken in their tenders, now I would like some chicken with the bread I was served. Chicken was super dry like it's been sitting under a hot lamp for hours. Last time I go to any Popeyes."}
{"text":"Did drive tru and Grace (person at the drive thru) didn't understand us. We went to the window,  repeated the order,  she said it back and still got it wrong. Forgot the BBQ sauce and didn't even offer butter for the biscuits.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"Went on sunday evening,  manager does not know how to run his crew.  Waited almost 30 food to be completed. Manager hides behind the rack of chicken by the drive thru window so he doesnt have to deal with the irate customers at the register. Slow very slow service"}
{"text":"Pretty much like most Popeye's. Friendly service and pretty good food, self-serve free soda refills. Unfortunately this place wan't air conditioned the day I went making eating in very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Popeyes is one of my favourite fried chicken chains because of its crunchiness and seasoning, and this newer location lives up to the Popeyes par. The place is pretty spacious with booths and tables along the wall, and the staff are helpful. Been here a few times and the chicken is always hot, crunchy and flavourful."}
{"text":"I was a bit wary coming here after I saw the reviews about the slow service, but I decided to come anyway because it was the closest Popeyes. I think things might have changed, because we received our meal only 10min after entering the store with 7-10 customers already waiting in line to order. The place is spacious and had seating along the wall, and we got the 10pc for $20 special. Food was up to Popeyes standards, and service was quick and considerably friendly."}
{"text":"Finally tried popeyes after 29 years of living! Unfortunately I didn't have one near me back in Jersey. For a fast food fried chicken place, it was really good (comparing it to KFC, Church's and other fast food friend chicken places). Very crispy and has a kick to it."}
{"text":"When this establishment first opened I was extremely excited AND impressed! I've been to this place a total of 7 times. 3 of which I've dined in and 4 of which were drive thru experiences. The dine in experiences were great! They never got my order wrong, they were prompt and they always seemed to have whatever I ordered (which is usually the same thing (3pc tender strips combo)). BUT out of my drive thru experiences there was only once when my order was completely right, I didn't have to wait and they weren't out of something. I understand the pies are extremely popular so I'm usually willing to wait until they make more, but when you tell me it will be 10 minutes to make more then that's what I'm expecting. The last two times it's taken 20 minutes! For 2 pies?! Also they've been getting my sides wrong. I've ordered mashed potatoes and received green beans. I've ordered red beans and received mashed potatoes. ? Being that I'm from New Orleans I gotta have my Popeyes every once in a while. The fact that this place is the nearest Popeyes is disheartening. 

A few good things is that 1) This place is very clean 2) The employees are usually very friendly AND 3) They usually move very quickly. So overall I would say with this place your best bet is to dine in when visiting."}
{"text":"Newest location in a spotty part of town, but you wouldn't know it from their customer service. Outstanding in every way. They had a very long line in the drive thru, and ran out of spicy strips, but I was given mild strips and extra wings just for the inconvenience. They were very quick and efficient with getting everyone served and when I reached the order pick up window, they girl chatted with me until my food arrived."}
{"text":"Once a year, I trek 15 miles from North Scottsdale to Popeyes for a special birthday - to go - dinner for a friend. (Don't ask).

Arriving today, there were signs up that said \"cash only\", because internet was down. 

No one was in the restaurant except employees. Even the regional manager was there trying to get things sorted out. 

I had no cash. 

Instead of sending me to a cash machine, after hearing about my long drive, for a birthday dinner, he comped the whole meal, trimmings and all. 

You'd think, perhaps, because they had to have turn away a ton of people who had no cash that the food would be less than fresh. Well, even after my journey back home, which took nearly a half hour, the chicken, mashed potatoes, rice and biscuits tasted as if they had just been put out. 

Thanks, Dave. And I'll check out the new Popeyes locations opening closer to me soon."}
{"text":"I was craving some crispy crunchy fried chicken. I hadn't eaten at a Popeye's in years so we decided to head over and get some spicy Southern style eats. 

The store is small but well decorated. We decided on the summer special: 10 pieces of fried chicken with 2 large sides and biscuits for $20. Not a bad deal! It was made in only a few short minutes and we were out the door in no time.

The chicken pieces were well battered and I loved the super crispy, crunchy spicy shell. The chicken inside, even the breast meat, was tender and juicy. We had the green beans and red beans with rice as sides. If you mix the two together it makes for a tasty combination! The biscuits were decent, nothing too special.

Service was friendly and cheerful. I'll be back for more fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Well I'm a Popeyes big fan 

This time i get 2 pice combo
With

Cajun rice and coleslaw

And dipping sauce was blackened flavor

Staff was friendly and very helpful 

Thank you everyone for the great experience"}
{"text":"Ordered a \"Ripp'n\" Chicken Platter with an iced tea, coleslaw, and mashed potatoes no gravy. Paid for everything. When I got home, in my bag I found the chicken with a biscuit, mashed potatoes with gravy and an extra thing of gravy. I don't like the gravy, which is why I order the potatoes without! And I was ripped off a whole regular sized side. The chicken was soft and not crunchy at all, and I swear the biscuit was doughy on the inside. Don't waste your money at this location, and if you do, never leave without checking your order."}
{"text":"Wasnt happy with my popcorn shrimp, fish and spicy chicken. I felt the oil was used and left a bad taste in my mouth. I will definitively stay away from this Popeye location. The staff were helpful but was not attentive coz they forgot to give us spoon, napkins, ketchup and hot sauce."}
{"text":"Okay so I've never really been a fan of Popeye's. I tried one in Vegas and another connected to a gas station. Blech! But this one changed my opinion. The spicy chicken was delicious and the mashed potatoes with gravy (with jalapeños in it!!)! So good. The Mac and cheese had no flavor, the mashed potatoes made up for it for sure. This Popeyes is a keeper!"}
{"text":"Gave both me and my husband the runs! Avoid if you have a colon! Service was rude as well, very young, undisciplined staff"}
{"text":"Just ordered a 12 piece meal from this place and when we got home, we realized what a mistake it was.  The $26 meal consisted of burnt, re-heated chicken.  The 12 pieces consisted of 6 burnt legs, 2 burnt wings, and 4 small burnt thighs.  Apparently their farmers are supplying them with modified chickens!  On the actual receipt it states 3 breasts, 3 thighs, 3 legs, and 3 wings.  Not even close.  So sad that these entry level jobs are too taxing for grown men and women to do with some sign of basic intelligence, but yet they think they deserve $15/hr!  Either that or they save the \"good stuff\" for their relatives and friends.  This was one step above going into the dumpster."}
{"text":"This location moved across the street to it own building no longer connected to the terribles.  My previous  experience here was not so great.  The staff would always forget to put spoons, condiments, and sometimes meals.  They also seemed to not care about customer service.

Now, this new location they must have changed staff cause it's night and day.  They were very prompt and assertive and most importantly got my order right and didn't forget anything."}
{"text":"This is the worst Popeyes I have ever been to. Their biscuits are hard and relatively tasteless compared to the fluffy and buttery Popeyes biscuit to which I have become accustomed. It doesn't even taste like they are using the Popeyes recipe. The staff is not well-trained and is not polite. The chicken doesn't taste quite like Popeyes chicken. I have tried this location three times since it first opened, hoping the overall experience with improved. Three strikes and you are out! No more"}
{"text":"Worst fast food I've ever had. The first time I came here, I ordered a combo. The only thing I could eat was the biscuit. My four year old, too. So, today I came back for a biscuit and the drive thru guy asks me if I want my change! Since when is that optional? Then I needed a knife to spread the butter, but he wouldn't come back to the window so I could ask for one. Never returning."}
{"text":"What I don't like here is the service. There is a young girl who is almost always working. I have seen her try and pick fights with customers. She is very sarcastic, but it isn't nearly as funny as she thinks it is. Most of the other employees are helpful, but will never give me an answer as to why they don't have the macaroni side-dish. I have been coming here for 3 years and they never have it. Just take it off the damn menu! 

I've also arrived here before to be told \"we are out of chicken\" or \"we are out of biscuits\". They rarely have both flavours of their dipping sauce, and I am almost made to feel like an idiot when I ask for that damn macaroni and cheese... sorry.. keep going back to that. 

I can't blame the staff - its poor management or inventory control. But when you are called \"Popeyes Chicken and Biscuits\", people should show up being able to expect chicken and biscuits."}
{"text":"Found a piece of hair inside my chicken then found some hard weird looking object inside my mashed potato.. disgusting please do not go here"}
{"text":"Went there and they ran out of chicken that was cooked.they said it would be 30 minutes wait.we had to get a refund.other customers were yelling and complaining as well.this location sucks"}
{"text":"The nicest, cleanest, Popeye's I've ever been to. But since opening it has seemed to drop in care, and I feel like the workers and supervisors are unorganized at times. I had to argue just to use a coupon I had won from timeplay because they were saying it doesn't exist, meanwhile I've used the exact same coupon at the exact same location before."}
{"text":"Mild and Spicy available.  Big juicy pieces!!

Seating inside, staff and service is good!!

Very tasty!! Young kids may find the mild a little spicy. Teens and adults will love it, and you can even add hot sauce to it."}
{"text":"Raw chicken at this location.  I showed the manager the thigh piece.  All he did was took it back, and gave me a new piece without explanation or apology.  Not even a single word was spoken from him.  In shock and disgust I threw out the remainder of my meal and left.  Think twice before eating here, might be your last meal."}
{"text":"Worst f***ing place ever! Went in, ordered my food, they asked me to wait for the mild tenders so I waited, came back to work but into my food and it's spicy......excuse me why the hell did I wait just to get spicy when I ordered mild?! And I have a reflux disease which does not allow me to eat any kind of spicy food what so ever otherwise I'm in pain for hours on end. And on top of that my side is wrong as well but to top it all off I've called the place a few times because this is my damn lunch break, I don't have time to go back or go anywhere else for that matter but now they took the phone off the hook and the mind remains busy sooooooo I'm super pissed and not ever going back and letting everyone at work know not to go here anymore!!!!! I'M INFURIATED!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just went here today, very good and fresh food. Amazing biscuits, and tenders. Popeyes never disappoints."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the greatest fast food restaurants I've ever visited. The food quality is always top notch, the flavour is always consistent, and the service always on point. The chicken that you see in pictures, and in commercials, is the same chicken you get at the restaurant.  Trust me when I tell you guys, you won't regret coming here."}
{"text":"Incorrect posted hours. Wasted time walking over here when their hours posted on Google and Yelp say 7am opening. It's 9am and the place is shuttered."}
{"text":"I love Popeye's chicken but my visit here has given me a bad taste now. The service was VERY slow and VERY inaccurate.It took about a half hour just to order,which they had only one cashier and a minimal line.When I received my food it was cold,halfway cooked,and not correct.The employees's uniforms were dirty (not from food) but looked like they had not washed them in days.The manager looked like he had just been released from prison and didn't know his job.

When I used the restroom there was no toilet paper,it smelled like cats,dirty walls,floor,toilet,sink and the soap dispenser was surprisingly full (which worried me that employees did not wash their hands!!) I asked the manager for toilet paper and he gave me napkins.

Not even once did I see the employees wash their hands when they were touching the register then packing food.Lobby was disgusting,soda machine was out of majority of drinks,no utensils out in lobby and the AC was on minus twenty degrees.

The only reason I stayed was because my boyfriend wanted the two piece Tuesday special and insisted we stay since we already ordered.My visit to this Popeyes's was horrible and upsetting. I will never go there again and I hope they get new management and crew because this place should of been shutdown!!"}
{"text":"I ate here when it first opened, and I got extremely sick. Needless to say, I haven't been back."}
{"text":"I've never been to any other Popeye's. I'd give this place 4 stars if it weren't such a dive. The chicken though is brilliant. Wow. So sweet and succulent and crispy. I'm a huge fan of KFC, but Popeye's is different. It seems to be juicier and more flavourful. The mashed potato with Cajun sauce is also delish. I don't eat a lot of fried chicken...but I plan to eat more!"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes! It's my nearest location! But the last two times I went were complete duds. Disgusting, in fact. The chicken tenders were tasteless pieces of cardboard. I've not had them at other locations, so I can't compare...but these were dreck. And last time I went, the spicy chicken pieces were waaaay overcooked. The drumstick tasted and smelled like burnt flesh. I threw it away. Not at all impressed."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on Saturday to take out some comfort food and this Popeyes was on our route going home. Maybe I was just emotionally and physically exhausted on Saturday and super hungry but everything we ordered here tasted great and left me wondering what their secret ingredient could have been. The setup of this Popeyes location, I found very unique because inside the store, they have a Yogurty's Froyo stand where they have the best and healthiest frozen yogurt ever (separate review on this to follow in the future). 

On Saturday night, we ordered the popcorn shrimp combo, a couple of pieces of chicken, with sides of cajun mashed potatoes, french fries, and biscuits and two giant-sized sprites (almost felt like movie theater style). Service was fast and the food tasted good as it consistently has in the past whenever we order from Popeye's. My only disappointment that I can express is the portion of popcorn shrimp they gave us was very stingy considering the total price we paid for our order. What we got was this big sized box, which is meant to feed 2 people, with small popcorn shrimp bits that barely filled half of the box and drowning in a lot of fries. Out of all our items ordered, I really enjoyed the chicken and its crispy texture and their french fries have a nice flavor without being drowned in a lot of salt. 

Popeyes will always continue to be one of our favorite places to go whenever we have a fast food craving."}
{"text":"Ordered the 16 piece dinner /with 3 sides and biscuits-to serve 2 adults and 4 small children. each person got no more than a teaspoon- and I do mean teaspoon of each side!.....Really if you advertise side at least give more than a bite for each person.   Thursday 12/17/15."}
{"text":"Wow! Popeye is taken a beaten throughout the Las Vegas valley. I will give this Popeyes the verbal spinach that it needs in the form of a three star review. In reality, the experience that I had here was a three star experience that is on par with the fast food industry. 

   Before I continue, I must say that it is hard to believe that this Popeyes is already 2 & 1/2 years old. Time flies by when your having fun yelping in Vegas. I guess time goes by so fast because you are having fun eating out in places like Popeyes. 

   What finally led me here after 2 & 1/2 years was the Popeyes $5 Big Box promotion that appeared on my Facebook page. This $5 Big Box promotion that concluded on September 27, included two pieces of chicken, a biscuit, and two sides. An additional $1.50 brought a medium Coke that was the equivalent of a medium Coke. I would order a thigh and breast. Unlike the Centennial Popeyes, another location ravaged by bad ratings, there is a $1.50 charge for two breasts. 

   This was a dining in experience. The employees were pleasant and the restaurant was clean. This was noon on a Monday afternoon. I had zero complaints about the speed of service. Moreover, I had zero complaints about the food. 

  The chicken was good. There is far better and far worse chicken in the valley. Of course I favored the chicken breast over the thigh for the simple fact that there is far more chicken meat on the breast than there is on the bony thigh. It wasn't just the chicken. In between bites of the Cajun style chicken, I savoured the Cajun rice and Cole slaw. For the record, their Cajun rice has been a Popeyes favorite of mine when we would stop at a New Jersey Popeyes in the 1980s. By the time I threw the remaining chicken bones in the garbage, I knew that I didn't throw $6.50 plus tax in the garbage. This meal was worth the money. 

  At the time I write this review, Popeye needs more than the verbal spinach of a 3 star rating. Popeye is facing a battle that makes Bluto and the Sea Hag seem like a fight against a chicken. At the time of this writing, Stephanie Street where Popeyes is located in front of Winco, is becoming ground zero in the fried chicken restaurant war. Just one block north of Winco, Raisin Cane's also from Louisiana is going up at the corner of Wigwam. Further up the street, one of if not the first Chick-fil-A in Las Vegas will open at Stephanie and Warm Springs. Recently KFC opened at Stephanie and Horizon Ridge. To make a long story short, Popeyes is going to have serious competition. My advice for Popeye is to permanently offer the $5 Big Box combo and eliminate the charge for two chicken breasts. Most of all Popeye will have to be proactive with consistent customer service and food to generate the verbal spinach that is necessary to have good ratings to bring people inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Popeye is taking a beating. It's not from Bluto or the Sea Hag. It is from Yelpers. Out of 53 Yelp reviews, this Popeye has a 1.5 star rating average. In the World of Yelp, stars instead of spinach will give Popeye strength. I am giving Popeye 3 stars which ought to boost up the rock bottom rating average. I am going to share the reason why I gave Popeye 3 stars. 

   This past Sunday evening on July 10 I had just returned from hiking up and down Cathedral Rock. Just like the Yelp ratings did to this Popeyes, the 1,000 plus elevation change gave my stamina a beating. By the time I returned to Las Vegas and exited off US 95 onto Durango Drive, my hunger had kicked in. In this hungry state I pulled into the Popeyes parking lot. 

  When I walked inside Popeye's,  there were only a couple of customers. I don't know if it is the bad Yelp ratings or just a slow Sunday evening that caused the lobby to be nearly empty. All I know was that I decided on the two piece chicken meal with a side, biscuit, and medium Coke beverage. The woman who took my order was pleasant. She was pleasant to the point that when the other customer decided she did not want the green beans, she exchanged it without a problem. However if the woman that took my order was rude or extraordinary nice, I was cognizant of the Popeyes signs and table brochures inviting me to take a brief survey by calling 1-800-682-0219 or visiting www.tellpopeyes.com. Likewise when I walked into the restaurant my first impression was Popeye's gives the perception of taking customer service seriously by posting a sign on the door with the store manager's name and a phone number. 

  Right off the bat (or in this case you could say right off the bone), I noticed that Popeye's does something different that quite a few chicken restaurants don't. This difference is that their customer can choose any two kinds of chicken from the wing, thigh, or leg. I chose the thigh and leg spicy crispy with Cajun rice. I realized that ordering the thigh was a mistake because the wing was far superior. The wing was a large size portion of white delectable chicken meat. After this mistake, I will order two chicken wings the next time I return to Popeye's. As far as the Cajun rice, I have been a fan of it going back as the 1980s when Popeye the Sailor Man was the official mascot of Popeye's Chicken. Complimenting the chicken and Cajun rice was my favorite all-time drink Fanta Strawberry soda. This post-hiking supper came out to less than $8.

  Now in my car and headed toward Durango Drive, I observed that the drive-thru business was busy. Whether or not my three stars will rejuvenate Popeye, I don't know. What I do know is that eating in this Popeye's rejuvenated Me after hiking up and down Cathedral Rock."}
{"text":"My wife and I just went through the drive thru at this location. The service was fast and friendly. And the food was fresh. Even with two cars ahead of us this was the fastest service I have had at a chicken  establishment  drive thru. Good job guys. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"No one at this establishment can read write or count money always get the wrong change back wrong order and always there I was never ever get any condiments in my bag what does it take to get people to do their job and read the screen correctly and get orders out the window right make your day easier make my day easier. Or just quit and let somebody else come there that's worthy and wants to work and Paris and right and count change handle the position the way it supposed to be handled. My vice find the next closest Popeyes ago that I don't waste your time or give yourself a headache or get into a fight"}
{"text":"Came 30 minutes before closing time and wanted an 8pc family meal all spicy. Was told they only had 3 spicy pieces  left and the rest could be mild? But also offered to satisfy the customer and told me I could wait 15 minutes and he could make all spicy. Fresh chicken right? He also offered a free drink while we waited and was very nice and gave awesome customer service the entire time. I was impressed and will coming back to this location only!"}
{"text":"Came here cuz I only had time to grab a quick bite before work. I'm pretty hungry I order the biscuit cheddar battered butterfly shrimp meal with fries and a red bean and rice on the side. As soon as I get to the window the chick didn't know my order and asks me what my order was. So I tell her my order and pay then she hands me my bag. First of all the lady's attitude was awful on top of not knowing my order. Then I finally get my food and as soon as I get to work I notice there's no fries and no biscuit...  all I got was 5 shrimp and my beans and rice. Which btw doesn't taste as it normally does. Not coming back and not finishing this gross food. 

I never expect much from fast food but this is unacceptable 

Ps the drive thru wasn't busy there's no excuse for this"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location. I went through the drive thru. The lady was a little short and rude when I tried placing my order. My son ate first and immediately screamed out that it was too salty. He couldn't even finish it. I gave it a try and it wasn't bad but you can tell there was more salt than usual. I think I'll stick to my Popeyes on my side of town since I've never had bad service and the food was always good."}
{"text":"This place is full of rude, lazy people who don't know how to do their jobs. They move slow and their attitudes suck. Nobody there, including the manager, is trying to take responsibility for anything. This Popeye's is a major fail."}
{"text":"I stopped by on my way home from picking up my 4 yr old grandson, and it was a cold day 54 was the high and I walked in and the ac was on ! Really I thought it was odd so I asked the guy at the register if he  could turn off the ac and he asked me where I was from and I said Phnx az .Then he told me it isn't bothering me  Really ? Bye  bye dine in there"}
{"text":"I have a hard time giving a fast food establishment five stars, I mean, that is ludicrous. But I must...dangit. I have had ups and downs here but the ups outweigh the downs as they have always made it right and gone above and beyond on the \"down\" occasions. I got the five buck surf and turf basket (fat kid here at heart) the order was perfect, Popeye's Chicken is the Shiznit, just let it slide down your throat (if you've watched the movie 'Little Nicky\" you know what I am talking about) well, it's true. The shrimps were good, the chicken was perfect and fresh. I received an adamant amount of the sauces I requested and also when I asked what she suggested, she said, oh, you have to add cocktail sauce, so got some of that too! The customer service was on point and friendly and my belly was full of cheaply priced, quality food, nicely prepared packaged goodness :)

Popeye's, can we please bring back the sugar cookie coated chicken...soooooo freakin' oddly good, love it!!! :)"}
{"text":"I have to say that this Popeye's location is the worst . And I love Popeye's chicken. The customers service is non-existent. When taking my order the cashier acted as if I was bothering her ordering my food. Then it took up 20-30 min of my lunch time to get my food. Also the was another customer there complaining about her order being incorrect . And the workers acted like it was her fault .. WTF. I will definitely not be returning to this location EVER again. Making sure that my friends and family don't either ."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through, was a fairly quick process and all was well until we arrived home. We both ordered chicken strips, we received no sauces after the gentleman in the window asked what kind we wanted and when we arrived home we had chicken and fish mixed together. Will never return here."}
{"text":"Okay, I know, fast food chain, but the two pieces for a $1.29 (drumstick and thigh, choose the spicy) is a good deal from a taste standpoint, though your heart will hate you in the morning from all the fat but hey, live a little. A few weeks ago I tried the little hot sauce packets they offer on the chicken and wow, so good! I am also a fan of the red beans and rice - the biscuits - blah...but overall, I do stop by once or twice a month, on a Tuesday, on the way home, so I must like it. If you have never tried it remember, spicy chicken, drizzle on some hot sauce, and dig on in to a lowbrow but delicious culinary treat. :-)"}
{"text":"This Popeye's is so ridiculous to be so new.  Every time I come here there is always something wrong with my order.  Today I stopped in to get a large red beans & rice with 2 biscuits. Well they forgot to give me my biscuits and the rice appeared to be overcooked. I called to speak with manager and needless to say they never answered the phone. If you want better service,  go some where else!"}
{"text":"Good service, fresh and crispy! Great location that's consistently good. Washrooms are decently clean as well. 

Check online for coupons before you go to get a better deal for delicious food! 

Got $14.99 for 2 people deal with 5 pieces of bonafide chicken, 2 regular sides, and 2 drinks which was more than enough for my boyfriend and I. We also tried the cherry cheesecake pie which had a yummy filling but the outer layer lacks that flaky and pastry texture.  

Overall great experience, definitely the best location compared to the Chinatown and annex one."}
{"text":"I truly hate that this is the closest Popeyes to my house. As much as I love the food, the employees are nothing more than ghetto, rude & in capable of having anything resembling manners. Let's make it clear that \"yup\" is not a response to thank you. And rolling your eyes is not a response to \"May I please have some buffalo sauce\". This restaurant should be embarrassed to employ people who think it is acceptable to work in the service industry and act like this."}
{"text":"Tuesday $1 2-piece chicken is the only reason for me to come.  Otherwise, the sides cost more than the chicken! Its fast food so can't expect much."}
{"text":"Ordered on uber eats. Got 2 tenders combos. 1 had a disgustingly tiny amount of fries, the other literally 4 onions rings. Both boxes quite empty. Chicken wasn't cooked properly. Bad experience. And from the time the food was picked up to the time it was delivered was about 5 minutes so had nothing to do with delivery"}
{"text":"If we're eating fast food for a reason, Popeye's is hard to beat.  We love the mild chicken, coleslaw and potatoes.

We stopped on our way \"home\" for some take-out.  Attendant on the voicebox was almost inaudible.  She slurred her words and talked fast.  Once at the drive thru window we still couldn't understand what she was saying very well.  We only knew the price when we got the receipt and change back.  

Food was good and hot.  Nothing much else to say.  We will probably stop back again."}
{"text":"We do like Popeyes Kitchen and stopped for lunch.  We found the location to be easy to enter and it was clean.

The cashier didn't seem to be quite there.  She had trouble getting the order right and kept asking repeat questions.  However, we did stumble through it.  Our food was hot and it was good.

There is background music at this location.  Well, not really background music as that would have been soft and simple.   It was so loud it was hard to have a conversation.  Cashier eventually turned it down.

Food was good."}
{"text":"Ordered from just eat and they forgot my fries and there was no biscuit!!! What the hell!!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the friendly staff. Been there several times and everyone has always went out of there way to provide good service and excellent food. My favorites are the sides and could make a meal out of the mash potatoes and spicy gravy. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my first experience with this place. I went through drive-thru and the woman who was taking my orders could not get it correct. I needed to go up to the window and let the guy at the window know what i wanted so he could fix it.  The manager was behind him and kept telling him to just give me the wrong order that they thought i wanted, but the staff member at the window kept telling her what our order was.  This place would get a 1 star but because of the great staff member at the window this place gets a 2 star. Management needs work here and i hope they read this"}
{"text":"By far the worst experience at a Popeyes ever, and i wasn't even the one to go out and get the food. My GF ran to popeyes to get us some food today, and she was in abit of a hurry since she had about an hour to kill before she had to go to work. 
Anyway, when she came back she started telling me how incompetent some of the workers are. When she received her order, she noticed some of the items were missing. She also asked for BBQ and Ranch, however they decided to just throw in some mustard instead. When she asked if she could get her BBQ and Ranch, one of the girls gave her a rude look like it was a huge inconvenience. She finally got the rest of her order and came home. 
When she got home, we started getting the food out of the bag and noticed they gave us 2 sides of Mac n Cheese instead of the 2 sides of Mashed Potatoes we ordered. 
The Chicken was completely inedible, it was cold, and it was old. We had a piece of chicken each and threw away the remaining (3) strips we had left. We spent over $20 in food. We could have just gone to a sit-down restaurant, gotten fresh made to order food, served to us with drinks for that price. Instead we got this. 
I will NEVER EVER drive the 4 miles from my home to get this garbage at this location. I used to live across the ST from the Elliot and Priest location. That one is MUCH better."}
{"text":"For every Popeye's I've been to...this is the WORST ONE! I used to drive an hour and a half to get Popeye's.. when they opened 30 mins away... I still made the drive... they are literally 7 mins away with traffic and I refuse to go.
Poor service, order is NEVER right, wait time is ridiculous  ( might as well fry the chicken myself), try to discuss your grievances with manager.. epic fail.
I am highly disappointed and will not be giving my business to Popeye's for awhile!
Suggesting firing the whole staff and start over!

This place needs to close! The manager is the only position that needs to be saved."}
{"text":"I have to agree that some of the best part of Popeye's is their commercials. The restaurants are clean and the staff is friendly enough, but beyond that? Not much to rave about, and I certainly don't think about New Orleans while I'm there.

While switching into my cranky old man mode, it used to be that fast food was fast - so if you go to grab a bite, you'll be in and out in no time. Then someone decided that food sitting around was a bad thing, so everything had to be made fresh. I get that fresh food is better than food that has been sitting around, but can we agree that if we're eating at a fast food joint, we've conceded that we're not getting anything particularly healthy?

Now that that discussion is over, why does it take so long to get a simple meal of a couple fried pieces of chicken and some fries? And when it does get there, why is it not particularly good? There are definitely better places to go if this is what you are after."}
{"text":"This Popeyes took like 17 minutes to screw my order up. On the evening I was there they had no idea what in the hell they were doing. My love hate relationship certainly swing to hate this time. Check your order before you leave, they may have left something out.... You have been warned..."}
{"text":"Surliness comes standard at Popeyes with every meal or drive-thru order. This is the anti-shrine to service with a smile customer service, it's Louisiana fast food with attitude. So why go there? For us it's spicy chicken strips. Since there's no Chick-Fil-A in Vegas with spicy chicken and the over hyped Raising Canes seems to not know where the spice container went this is the only place that takes care of the spicy chicken strip cravings. 

It's on Boulder Highway! Oh my gawd, you might have to go into a \"sketchy\" part of town! Puhleeze, get over it! Go. You know you want chicken! Double check your order, be prepared to overpay a bit, and when you get an attitude or have to repeat your order 4x don't gripe. You were warned. I go for the chicken strips but they have other good things too. (Their coleslaw is better than most places I've found yet in Vegas by far!)"}
{"text":"Horrible! Food smells rotten and they take forever in the drive through. All in all this place is very dirty and sucks. When I was there one of the Popeyes employees and one of the shell employees (this place is consolidated with the shell) we're talking about screwing (lesbians) and trust me, these aren't the type of lesbians you want to see. Lol never going back!"}
{"text":"Worst location ever. They don't know how to talk to customers , it took them 25 mins to get our order and the manager  Raba was very rude when I asked if they can give us the food faster because we had to open our fast . The manager needs to learn some manners before talking to customers. WORST POPEYES EVER"}
{"text":"Went to drive thru a few times without any issues. Sure, they aren't the friendliest but at least I had no problems with any of my orders. Chicken is always fresh  and I love their selection of side items."}
{"text":"Picked up dinner on the way home. Much better service this time. Shamika was friendly and professional. Fast service today.Big improvement!"}
{"text":"Come here on Tuesday no Tuesday special here  close to house but will continue to drive to Craig Rd location more friendly place. At Craig Rd location place order and get what I ordered."}
{"text":"I love Popeyes chicken. But what I don't understand is how this new Popeyes is going to stay in business. They don't have the Tuesday special. I've only been there twice. Both times I have seen people walk in and leave immediately empty-handed. This place is not off to a very good start. I'm just saying...."}
{"text":"Stopped in last week to get a quick lunch on way back to work from running errands on my lunch break. Decided to fill out the survey on the back of the receipt for a free 2 piece and drink purchase. This is what I got for filling out the survey and going through the drive thru. Like Leo Gets said \"you get f$&ked in the drive thru\" LOL. P.S.  The biscuit came like that I didn't bite it!! LOL!!!"}
{"text":"This Popeye's has some serious issues! If the owner doesn't get his staff together the poor service and crappy attitudes will close this place down faster than it was built.

As with other reviewers, the staff is unprofessional, but that's attributed to the Manager Dennis who has a terrible attitude and could care less about the customers. 

Orders are continually wrong and they don't care. The food is cold. The hot sauce bottles in the tables are crusty and nasty and they don't want to give you packets of hot sauce. They never have ranch dipping sauce. They rush you through your order, which is probably why they never get it right. They need to focus on listening to the customer and slow down. 

The staff has been heard cursing both in store and while in the drive thru. I have never experienced a place with such rude staff. 

I will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"Three stars for their cajun gravy and mashed potatos. The popcorn shrimp wasn't too bad either. 
Their bone-in chicken really sucks, like WHERE'S THE MEAT?! 
Was not impressed with the red beans & rice either, but that could just be me...
Next time I'm craving Popeye's biscuits and gravy maybe I'll try the chicken tenders?
Could just be this location too..."}
{"text":"Awful service! 
Went through drive thru. 
Girl at the window wasnt even friendly,  and took other drive thru orders the entire time she was taking our money & giving us our food. 
Drove away, then realized they forgot our drink.
Walked inside in hopes to get better service. 
Took 5 mins to even be acknowledged. 
10 mins later, the missing drink was finally obtained.  
After all of that, was given a buy one get one coupon for that exact store. 
No thanks!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Three people took our order. Still got it wrong. The manager seemed in over his head and I honestly felt bad for him. He ended up refunding my money though. Very nice gesture."}
{"text":"After visiting this Popeyes, I felt compelled to make a yelp account and let my community know what a horrible experience I encountered today. First walking into this facility, I was very excited to finally be trying the new Popeyes in town. I hadn't had Popeyes in quite a while so, I had prepared myself to enjoy the taste I had been missing for years. I took my time deciding what I'd like to eat. When I went up to the counter to place my order, I automatically felt disconnected from the lady serving me. She was very quiet and did not speak a word to me the entire time I was there. First walking up, she did not greet me the way a customer should be greeted. At that moment I felt unwelcome at the store. As I was ordering all she did was nod her head. Even when it came time for her to tell me the price of my meal she did not; instead she walked away to serve someone else. I could see the price on the screen and realized I could insert my debit to pay. However, I was still disconnected from the lack of customer service. When I went to pour my drink, there were too many people in the way waiting for their food. The placement of the drink machine is awkward therefore, I was unable to pour my drink until after I received my food 3 minutes later. As I walked away with what I believed was going to be a delicious craving satisfied, it turned out to be another horrible experience. I got to my table and sat to eat my food. As I opened everything up I noticed there was no sauce for my chicken or a spoon/fork for my mashed potatoes. On top of that, there were no napkins and no biscuit; which we all know comes with every order and is the best part of the meal. I went up to the counter, leaving my food to get cold, to collect the missing items from my order. Each staff member ignored the fact that I was waiting to yet again be served. After finally getting the items that were missing, I went to try and enjoy my now cold meal. While sitting, an employee came and disrupted my meal by sweeping underneath my feet. After almost finishing my meal, I noticed a short black hair on what was left of my food. At this point I was disgusted. Considering my hair is long and blonde it was impossible for it to have been my own. I threw out what was left of my meal and went home. I paid almost $10 for a dispiriting experience that should have been avoided. My overall thoughts on Popeyes has definitely changed for the worse. I am so disgusted with Mississauga's newest Popeyes. After an absolutely horrible time at this restaurant, I can guarantee I will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"My family loves Popeye's Chicken Family Meals. We have tried the fried catfish a few times and it is not that great. Love, love, love the mashed potatoes and gravy, dirty rice, fries and even the mac n' cheese. So happy there is now a closer location!"}
{"text":"Sometimes we get takeout from here for work lunches. It's a nice change from KFC but some prefer KFC. Sometimes they are out of honey which my coworker likes with the biscuits, one time recently they were out of coleslaw. Last time I wanted a two liter and multiple two liter cokes I picked up were literally covered in visible grease! Honestly that kind of spoiled my appetite as my hands were covered in cold grease. So though the chicken is not bad, I am not feeling the overall attentiveness of the staff to the little things."}
{"text":"First, I'll start by saying I love the food, the menu and seasoning is amazing. But my last couple experiences here have been a nightmare! 


A couple weeks back I came and ordered food for the family, the cashier to begin was friendly, very talkative. I waited in the lobby as my food was prepared. Once I was given the bag I would have pulled everything out and checked, but being the fact that the restaurant was completely empty I figured there was no rush on their end. So once I drive all the way home my son's side was missing. Normally not something I'd personally drive all the way back for, but it wasn't my side. 
So I called told them what happened and prepared them that I was coming back. 15 minutes later when I finally got back the employee handed me my side and said \"here's your coleslaw.\" They acted like it wasn't a big deal that I had to go out of my way to leave my food at home to get cold because they screwed up. So I inquired with the manager about what can be done to compensate my trouble, the agreement ended up being an extra side of coleslaw so I left with my two sides. 
This was partially my fault for not checking the bag so I didn't make any fuss as far as review or further complaint, even though I felt the manager herself didn't care and didn't really try to resolve the frustration.


Now tonight the family decided to give it another go, this time going through the drive thru. 
This time we made sure to thoroughly search the bag and it was all there. The transaction was pretty quick and we even had to ask for sauce because it was never offered. When we got home we sat down to eat, I opened my box of chicken and my wife immediately pointed out to me there were two long black hairs in my food. Pretty gross!! (I don't know if I can post pictures directly in the review, but I did post the same review with pictures on their Facebook page) 


I'm not posting this review as a deterrent for others to eat here. The food is delicious, but I'm hoping this simply brings light to the lack of care I feel like not only staff but manager shows to their customers. If there was another location near me I'd probably drive a little further for better service."}
{"text":"I have only experience this location through the drive thru. However, the staff was not very friendly. Also, the chicken strips were sub par and I would not recommend them. The chicken was almost rubbery and took a long time to hew almost as if it had been microwaved too long. The potato wedges were fantastic and better yet were the biscuits.

I was irritated as they had a small selection of drink choices. Also, they were very hesitant to give me the amount of sauces I asked for- and I love sauces!"}
{"text":"How in the hell are you a chicken place with no damn chicken!? I went through the drive thru and she told me I only have 3 pieces of chicken in the whole restaurant! Wtf!!! You are a chicken company! Why the hell don't you ever have chicken!? And it's not just this location. This is the third location I have been to in Las Vegas that said they ran out of chicken! Get your sh*t together Popeyes!"}
{"text":"Why Popeyes?  It's a little bit if comfort food for the Southern girl. I have lived longer in the North at this point in life but I still have the heart of a Southerner. When I need some comfort food I head to Popeyes for their biscuits along with Red Beans and Rice.
I like their chicken but not a fan of their shrimp. The shrimp has a smell to it that is off putting. It is caked in coating. It's just gross. Every timer I go they are out if something. Tonight it was coleslaw. 
The restaurant is usually messy-not dirty but messy. The employees seem unhappy with their jobs and are condescending. If it weren't for the biscuits I would never go in.  They would get two stars except I'm hooked in the biscuits."}
{"text":"We are a fan of Popeyes. We like their chicken, beans & rice, and biscuits. I could eat a whole tray of those biscuits. Yum!  This was our first visit to this location. It was pretty new and very clean. It took a few minutes to get our food but it was because they were cooking it fresh. Plus they told is that when we ordered it. It was worth the few minutes wait. Our food was hot and tasty!!"}
{"text":"Ok third time to visit and I do not know Popeye's but what's up with the chicken? It is always sort of warm never hot. Hmmmm fancy new digs and you no longer serve hot chicken like the old place across the street. Color me
DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"My thoughts is rate a fast food chain amongst its piers. Great clean and friendly location. Tasty chicken and great sides. Reasonably priced so yea 4 stars for the Popeye."}
{"text":"We went through the drive through and picked up chicken and biscuits. The biscuits were delicious. The chicken isn't the best. The staff was friendly . Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Waited a long time for a chicken fast food in this neighborhood. Tried it twice. Chicken over cooked
Hard; threw it out; drive thru person disinterested
Won't go back. Hope they close and a decent KFC takes"}
{"text":"Good chickens and got dam that sweet tea sweeter than my grandma I tell u what go there get up on a 3 piece and don't forget the honey in the bun I mean y'all slippin if u forgetting that honey honey UGH FAM SKIP THE MASHED POTATOES THEY NASTY"}
{"text":"Little piece of advice. Check your bag and receipt BEFORE you leave the drive thru. Ordered items for the family and only when I got home did I realize they didn't package the entire order. Called that same day and was PROMISED my name and order would be placed it a book. Went back today to be compensated, and surprise surprise they have no record. They don't know who was working that day and the manager basically accuses me of lying about the order. Says they were even open on Super Bowl Sunday. Lol sorry, I was there that day with 3 other people in my car a few hours before kickoff. Not even about the money anymore, all principle and ethics. Just awful. Contacted corporate to discuss, haven't heard anything back. I don't expect it. Avoid."}
{"text":"Great service through drive-thru. In and out in 3 minutes. It's a wonder how experiences can be different when they are not over run and the customer isn't a demanding prick who thinks they are entitled a cape and scepter when ordering a $2 meal."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. Had an urge for a chicken run. The reviews at the one closest to me, Sahara, received 1 star. So I decided to bypass that one. I went at 2pm. Lunch died down and there was just a small trickle of people inside but the drive thru seemed busy enough still. The cashier was courteous. She was helping someone in the drive thru so I patiently waited until she was ready for me. She took my order and asked her supervisor to take over the drive thru person who seemed oblivious to the myriad choices of chicken that they have, spicy or non spicy. After I ordered and paid, I could still hear the super trying to get the order correct for the drive-thru genius who was still confused about what they wanted.

The chicken was crisp but pretty bland in my opinion compared to Church's. Its cooked according to company specs, it's just not very flavorful. I'd give them 4 stars but the chicken is just meh tasting to me so I give them 3. What do you ppl see in their chicken compared to my beloved Church's?

All in all, I don't think they deserve a 2 star. I can imagine how busy this place is at meal times, with people idling away at the drive thru, impatiently waiting for their crispy, but bland chicken. It's probably a mad house at 11 and 5. I stay away during those hours. I can just imagine ppl getting cranky as heck, playing with their phones, only bothering to look up every now and then just to curse the employees. Ugh, no thanks. Non-peak for me."}
{"text":"Popeyes on Miller Rd in Flint is so bad! Just left there & instead of getting a two piece all white meat dinner we got a thigh & a tiny leg & no dipping sauce for chicken fingers that I ordered. The girl at the window just looked at me as she handed me the bag without saying a word & had a sour look on her face. Will never go back to this location!!! Tried to call but no answer & their mailbox is full so no choice but to write this review."}
{"text":"Ugh. Love Popeyes but this location needs a huge upgrade in their customer service. Employee who took my order was extremely rude when I had questions about the menu and I had to stand at the counter for at least five minutes for a take home box when one person was on break and sitting at a booth playing with his phone with another sweeping the floor, mind you, we were the only people in the store along with another couple eating."}
{"text":"This new location just opened up so I decided to check it out.  Fries were not even warm, but I was already annoyed since people at work tapped danced on my nerves throughout the day so I really didn't feel like going back inside to get fresh ones. Plus, my chicken levels were low so I was just ready to get home and eat LOL. Chicken was good. Had the right amount of spiciness.  The highlight of course, was the biscuit with honey and butter."}
{"text":"I have only had the best experience here at this location. My chicken is always amazing and fast and the service is great. Today the woman who helped me, Drelle was very friendly and had great customer service. I wish I had this experience with every place I eat. My fave Popeye's and I am so happy I live so close to it"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. No \"hello\" and no \"thank you\". Refused to give me a cup of ice or ice water even though I would pay extra. Wow!"}
{"text":"Stopped here today for lunch. We're so disappointed with the whole meal. We got it right before 12 noon expect that everything should be freshed. The chicken tenders were so dulled, and dried, it's not hot just little warm and the batter was hard instead of crispy.  Biscuit was kind of old taste and salty, we ordered coleslaw, it was soaked in the creamy sauce and the cabbage is translucent looking.  We had to clean the messy table because it was covered with the sticky honey.  Staff, don't really know what they doing, ask one thing get something else. but the lady cashier was pretty pleasant not so fast but at least she acted like she's happy working with people. Seemed like everything went wrong and it did."}
{"text":"I eat here once in a while. I love Popeyes! However, on my visit today I was served three pieces of chicken that were pretty sad! Over cooked, dry, very small and hardly any meat! Where is the quality control? They should not have served this chicken! Actually it was so small I thought it might have been pigeon! 

Everything else was good.

I'm not sure if I will go back to this location again."}
{"text":"They are not ready for anything. No straw for drink and i was getting 11 pieces of chicken and ask two dipping sauce and they trying to charge each sauce. Are you serious?? Sauce for chicken tender only? What kind chicken place is this?! They need better management or training on customer."}
{"text":"Great place for chicken!  Mild or Cajun is a delight.  Also like their potatoes and gravy as well as their Mac and cheese.  You pay a little extra for all white meat but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Came to this location at 10:30 on a Monday and waited in the drive through for 22 minutes for 3 chicken strip. ...yikes I think they close earlier then listed. They also forgot our biscuits :( cross that off the  place off the list they need some work."}
{"text":"Stay away! They serve undercooked chicken!! One bite into their chicken \"tenders\" and was RAW inside. Tried to call to let management know, but no one ever picked up the phone."}
{"text":"What can I saw about Popeyes that hasn't been said. I definitely like it way more than KFC! The chicken at this location is always perfectly cooked. It's almost always fried fresh. Most times you have to wait a bit because they are making a fresh batch. The coating is nice and crispy and the chicken is super juicy. I prefer the spicy over the mild. Honestly my favourite thing on the menu is the chicken strips. They all all white meat, super tender an nice and crispy on the outside. The spicy tenders with the Ranch Dipping sauce is my favourite meal!"}
{"text":"Disappointment waste of money don't go here I believe they're building a canes not too far from this location. Sure this place would be out of business in a few months. Chicken dry food is gross people who work there are not personable not friendly."}
{"text":"Been here three times and every time seems like the staff don't care if you stand in line for five minutes and no one even says hi .... And you're the only one here"}
{"text":"Finally a popeye in champaign. Better fried chicken than any other fast food chicken place. But super slow and not as good service"}
{"text":"EVERYTIME I come here they say they are out of po boys....maybe you should take the item of the menu. RIDICULOUS!"}
{"text":"My favorite stop for fast food fried chicken! The spicy chicken is the greatest, and so are the biscuits.. The mac and cheese also wins, but the portion sizes of the sides served with the family meals could be WAY BIGGER. C'mon  Popeye! Don't skimp on the cajun rice and beans, yo!"}
{"text":"Food and staff are good.  Management could use some work.  Little tip, not a great idea to have half the staff on break during 12:00-1:00 lunch rush."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Today the lady working the drive thru was very pushy and rude. Also for the 3rd time in a row my order was messed up. Every time they forget my fries but I made sure that they didn't today. I saw on the recipe that it was written as my chicken being mild and I asked the lady to make sure it was spicy. She told me it was so when I got back to work I was really upset that it was mild. I called the manager hoping she would mention something about talking to the crew but she never did. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"What a rude custimer service! I was in a mood for chicken and I was kinda rush so I decided to go for the drrive through. I know that I have a very strong accent, that's why the guy who took order misunderstand my order from 4pc chicken to 12 pc. I have said sorry for all the unconvinced, he said I'm good and then handed me another box WITHOUT plastic bag, no napkin and ketchup as well. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Just picked up some Popeyes today for the Super Bowl party and have to say it was surprisingly empty. They usually always have a lineup.

The chicken was cooked very well (some other locations are a bit under cooked).

The fries though were kinda tasteless, and there new wings need more of a kick of flavor."}
{"text":"Worst customer service here. I was the only one in line and there were three (3) workers at the front doing things. They all look at me as if I was just there to say hi. I waited five (5) minutes to see if anyone would at least ask me to be helped. Right (8) employees walk to the front and they all just look at me and not say a word! REALLY??? EIGHT!???? Then one worker asked \"is this your order?\" I say no, and she goes then I can help you. You looked at me twice and not a word before! For real!?? NEVER GOING BACK THERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"Ordered spicy received mild. Sides were spilling all over because they didn't place in bags correctly. Pretty much tossed bag out drive thru window. Never again! I'd rather drive further for better service!"}
{"text":"Fast Food?!?? Really, we ordered our food at 6:16 and got our food at 6:47. Beyond ridiculous, our order was \"deleted\" so that's why the food took so long. Because it took so long we missed our 7:00 appointment elsewhere.

I felt like Bon Qui Qui was working there. So not cool!"}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Po' Boy and onion rings, and they tasted very mediocre.  My chicken seemed bland and on the dry side, and the onion rings like ones you could find at any run of the mill Burger King.  These days, I normally will not eat at a place that helps line the pockets of America's Cardiologists and Thoracic Surgeons, but I remembered how incredibly tasty Popeye's was when I lived in Jersey years ago, and I just had to stop on in to relive that craving.  My food philosophy is that if I am going to imbibe scads of sodium and trans fats, it better taste really good.  I was dissapointed.  Back to Boston Market for my chicken fix from now on.  Speaking of trans fats, Popeye's should be ashamed of themselves for still having unhealthy and dangerous trans fats in their foods!"}
{"text":"This place sure knows how to make some crispy, fried chicken! My kids LOVE their popcorn chicken dipped with honey. I'm all about the biscuits and gravy they have. 

What keeps me coming back, is the excellent service I always receive from Tim. He's always made sure my order was right, I had the condiments and utensils I needed to enjoy my meal & most importantly made sure I always left happy. 

Also, don't forget about their Tuesday deal 2 pieces for $1.69. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Today we had the best & freshest fried chicken that only Popeye's knows how to do RIGHT!! My family  and I had a wonderful time grubb'n down today! Wev'e been here several times before & its a lways a pleasure to return for the amazing quality of food! Please continue to keep up the great quality of chicken and other goodies! We cant wait to come back over & over!!"}
{"text":"This location is THE SLOWEST location on the planet. I have to wait 25 minutes+ in the drive-thru to order, and when I get to the window, the order is ALWAYS wrong. Avoid Durango and go to another one if you don't want to waste 30+ minutes of your life in a drive-thru."}
{"text":"Told me I would have to wait 5-6 minutes for catfish dinner to cook. OK. 11 minutes later, I go up to inquire about my food and they look at me like I have three heads. Typical inept customer service. Restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst locations I have frequented. The minimum wage employees always have attitude and make it very well known that your very presence is irritating to them. Franchisee owner apparently couldn't care less. Also this location has the absolute tiniest portions. A losing proposition in every way."}
{"text":"This popeyes is the worst. Ordered a 12 piece only got 11. I dont know if they cant count or what but I waited for about 15 min for my order. Then the fries were gummy and tasted like fish. Ok so moving forward when i got home and finally sat down and had a piece of chicken. The inside of one of the pieces had so much coagulated blood it was disgusting. Im not talking about a small spot the whole piece of chicken. Needless to say as soon as i find the receipt i will be calling customer service because i refuse to drive back out in all that traffic. A pure waste of money."}
{"text":"This Popeyes restaurant at 75th Ave. and the 101 freeway in Peoria is the only one I know of which I cover a lot of Phoenix Glendale Peoria area the only one that doesn't offer the Tuesday two piece chicken deal it's very disappointing I don't know the reasoning therefore I rate this restaurant a big negative"}
{"text":"The service and cleanliness at this location were both atrocious.   I had to repeat my order three times because the girl at the counter didn't speak english. As I was waiting I began to notice how filthy the place was.  The floor was sticky, table was sticky and behind the counter had all kinds of food scraps on the floor. Despite the repetition of my order three times I still received the wrong order.  Between the piss poor service and floor that must not have been cleaned in a month, I just left.  Waste of time and money.  I was going to ask for a refund but that probably would have taken a month for them to decipher."}
{"text":"The chicken strips here are LEGIT BRO. Fries were very good and the biscuit was good. The only reason I deduct a star is that the mashed potatoes were mushier than Alistair overeems brain after his last knockout. But the strips were the best I had. Not sure why this place has two stars maybe I came at a good day ."}
{"text":"This is the worst Popeyes I have ever been to and rudest drive thru staff I have ever encountered. Food over cooked and horrible!! Do not go there to high priced and BAD!!!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't usually write a review on a fast food restaurant, but I felt congratulations were in order. I can honestly say that my experience with Popeye's in Vegas has not been the greatest. I vudited this location about a year ago and I was not very please. I usually go to the Popeyes at nellis afb and an never dissapointed there. They happened to be closed so we ended up at this location (Rancho/bonanza). Newly remodeled, it's clean, the staff is quick, nice and attentive. The chicken was good and we were not disappointed. Give this location a try."}
{"text":"Food tastes okay. It's Popeyes, what can I say?

The service can sometimes be slow. I updated my review after I came back a few more times and meh it's your average Popeyes. 

Also they were very apologetic when I told them there was a bug in my soda last time and gave me another one for free... no bugs this time haha."}
{"text":"Terrible service and the parking is a mess. The food is the same as any other Popeye's so you might as well go 10 minutes west on Sheppard"}
{"text":"Bad. Just bad. Just go somewhere else. You'll be a lot happier you did.
Poor service, quality and attitude. This is a management problem as the employees reflect their decisions."}
{"text":"Their delivery is super fast ! Service is also fast on site. I have been dropping by every other week or so. What I do not like is the location, as it can be busy on Yonge Street, making it at times impossible to turn out of the plaza (esp. left). The parking lot has dumb drivers who don't look.

The chicken is great and as expected. However, it does feel like they are overcharging and the size has gone down a bit."}
{"text":"Why do all the bad food have to taste so good? Love hate relationship. Anyhow, I love popeye's... you can never go wrong with fried chicken right? 

This location is alright. We haven't tried their delivery yet, but things were served somewhat quick. Will likely be back if we are in the area. 

The popcorn shrimp was so good! A must try. We were slightly disappointed that the tooney tuesday meals do not include fries anymore."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! We stopped by this place because I had a major craving for fried chicken and saw it on our way. Boy, that was a wrong decision! Not only does this place overcharge but the employees' rude attitude was what made it unbearable. We ordered the 16pc combo-spicy and was told by the guy who rang us up that the wait would be 15 mins, we were fine with it. Then about 5 mins after our first order, we went up to order another two combos because we thought there might not be enough food. There were 3 workers behind the counter and yet all of them ignored us because they were talking to this one employee from Walgreen. If my brother in law didn't call to their attention, we would have waited for a while. Nonetheless, we disregarded and went ahead to order our chicken tenders. 30 minutes later, they still didn't call our order but I saw them handing out chicken tenders to other customers who placed their order after us. My brother in law decided to come up and ask when our order would be ready and this one girl Shay snatched the receipt from him, took a look at it and raised her voice at him saying that 'we told you it would take 15 mins', then slammed the receipt on top of the counter. That obviously ticked off my sister as she told pumpkin Shay that we waited for half an hour already. She then proceeded to throw our chicken pieces into the box and wouldn't stop even when her coworker (the guy who rang us up) snudged her; she even shoved his hands away. Obviously, her mood turned sour afterward and we noticed she was being totally rude to other customers as well. So now we can't even tell whether Shay was just being racist to us because we were the only Asian group there or she was just a crazy dawg that pretty much barked at every person who came her way. Regardless, that's not how she should serve her customers. Long gone was the day she came in for an interview and was asked situational questions on how to handle certain incidents. I agree that I can't expect 5-Star service at Popeye but I am certain that we don't deserve this kind of treatment either. She paid with money to get our food, we didn't beg for it. Whoever the manager of this store is should either get fired for allowing such behaviors at their store (anyone can tell that this isn't the first time Shay throws her tantrum, she must have done it a lot of times for her not to give a crap about anyone anymore) or retrains his/her employees. Maybe we can try and post on Facebook how Shay mistreated her customers and hopefully the manager is smart enough to pinpoint what goes wrong and perhaps they can start educating Shay to stop biting every hand that feeds her and start acting like she's in the customer service industry for once."}
{"text":"I came to this location for the third time in 5 years. The first time, this location had good food but there were cockroaches & flies everywhere. The second time was last year 2014, the place was crowded, the staff was very friendly, the restaurant was cleaner but still had a couple of cockroaches around me but then again I'm also Mexican, I lived with cockroaches my entire life lol, but the food was horrible & the chicken was so dry.

Today September 13, 2015 is the third & final time I'll ever step foot in this location. It seemed as if they put out the chicken they cooked last night, the mashed potatoes were very watery. There was no ice in the ice dispenser, I was trying to get help but there was a worker busy watching tv, and another one on her phone. It seemed like I was getting on their nerves cause I wanted help getting ice for me & my kids but they were busy doing their own thing. When we sat on the table there was trash under us & plastic water bottles everywhere. Worst Popeye's experience ever"}
{"text":"Turn down the music!  I couldn't hear the person sitting across the table from me.  The so called spicy chicken tenders were blah, where's the spice.
There also was very little chicken in them, mostly crusty breading.  The best thing was the drink dispenser.  Lots of variety."}
{"text":"One of the better locations that I've normally visited with friendly staff and actual delivery (which is sparse throughout the city). The place is definitely in need of some cleaning after the lunch rush but they seem to make it work most of the time. Service here takes a bit longer than most, but the staff is friendly and attentive after a few years of poor service dragged them down a bit.

The fries recipe seems to have changed again, but all of the items are pretty much standard for franchises across the board. Glad to see these guys pick it up and do better."}
{"text":"Popeye's used to be one of those places that had better quality and flavor profiles than most fast food chains and very respectable portion sizes.

There's some debate as to whether corporate pressure from head office has decreased portion sizes and reduced the weekly sale offerings which have turned away many long time customers. So now, we're paying higher prices for roughly 1/2 of the food given before. In feeding a family of four, I shelled out over $40 without any  leftovers.

Over the years, service quality has declined as some of the employees have gotten too comfortable in their jobs. Though the food is fresh, delivery time is normally very long, and some front end staff bill for unavailable/items not received. If service quality improved a bit, I'm sure they can restore some of their customer base."}
{"text":"Food is great, now getting your order correct is a whole different story.  Went twice same day, drive thru did not get it right Went inside talked to female manager  (figured she do it right wrong) she screwed it up. The only thing I can figure you have to be bilingual to order. But food is great!!"}
{"text":"How do u ran out of chicken and ask me to wait 15 minutes!!! 

I do drive through for a reason!"}
{"text":"I've driven by it a million times but never stopped expecting the worse.  Tired of burgers I finally stopped tonight after seeing their TV ad.  What a surprise...The shrimp poorboy was good.  The biscuits were great.  Try it out."}
{"text":"Well I guess I got lucky that they were busy. My spicy chicken took a while to get but it was worth the wait. It was really tasty and so was the biscuit!"}
{"text":"Shit was so bad I was afraid to feed it to my dog. This is the second Popeyes in Arizona I've been to and they've both been TERRIBLE. 
Whoever handles the territories should be fired immediately, 

Poor quality and awful management."}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying I looooove popeyes. So the fact that my experience was ruined thanks to Autumn and/or Jazmyn (my receipt says Jazmyn but the girl who was helping me had a name tag that said Autumn). Lets start with Autumn, she was the kicker of this shiteous experience I had on April 2nd. (yes, the same date as the two posts below, expressing their exact distasteful experience from this location). I come up to the drive thru and I am compiling a large order; she greets me and I politely stated \"one second, please\". I kid you not, literally 10 seconds later, she blurts out \"did you want to try a box or something\". I answered, yes but I still need one second, thanks. She huffs and puffs (first strike on my patience). Then not even, one minute later, I let her know I am ready. Huffs and puffs (AGAIN), ok go ahead; I proceed to let her know, I have a deal for buy a three piece meal and get a two piece meal for free. I repeated, three or four times - can I please get a mild three piece meal with mashed potatoes and fries with a strawberry Fanta. WHAT? HUH? Huffs and puffs (AGAIN. 3 times already). I repeated again and FINALLY, she got it. Then we moved on to the same struggle for the two piece. I repeated that I wanted two piece spicy with red beans and rice and fries. Easy enough; she continues to huff and puff. I order two chicken strip boxes and go to order a drink and she huffs and puffs and proceeds to hit me with an OMG. At this point I am irked beyond belief; I'm trying to find it in me to woosaa but this is absolutely ridiculous. I go up to the window and as I am handing her cash and the coupon; she rolls her eyes at me and I lose it. Girl, what is your problem, you're lucky I am on the younger side. Our parent's generation would be talking to your manager right about now. I understand it's the weekend and you probably don't want to be here but you are getting paid to do a basic task. Take orders and be decently friendly. All that huffing and puffing you are doing is not only annoying, it makes you look ugly as hell. As I am letting her know about herself, she interrupts me and adds, well if you don't like it, you can talk to my manager. I laughed out loud, like a literal LOL. and simply replied with If you don't want to drop the attitude, send your manager on over; otherwise, just let me pay for my food so I can leave. I am then handed, four boxes upside down and thrown in a bag and when I asked for sauce, another woman (I imagine Jazmyn) hands them to me trying to be super polite. I pulled up front checked my food, realized that she did not ask me what pieces of meat I wanted and was far too annoyed to even go back. When I got home (which is at least 10 minutes away), the food was mediocre at best. It was old and dry and not what I am used to, even from this location. My entire craving for popeyes was ruined. I have tried to call for a formal complaint but their number mysteriously doesn't work. So $25 dollars later, my food was not worth it or the attitude I was given. Safe to say, I will not be coming here for a while. I will let my craving be satisfied by the location on Central, a little bit of a push, but worth the fact that the workers aren't trying my patience by throwing some petty teenage shade this girl was doing."}
{"text":"Long wait and all out of soda, except diet. Not a good experience for a new restaurant. Food tasted old. Not coming back to this one."}
{"text":"I come here for their Tuesday specials! Can't really beat the deal ... Two chicken pieces (a leg and thigh) for like $1.50! And I get it spicy. I haven't been disappointed yet with the chicken. It comes out crispy and juicy. I've tried the jambalaya rice a couple times but I haven't really been too impressed with it. It's pretty bland."}
{"text":"The worst Popeyes I have ever been to in my life. I went to the drive-thru at 10:20. I ordered my food and there was 1 car in front of me waiting for theirs. They ordered something else and it took an extra 15 minutes. Instead of having the car pull around, they didn't. I got up to the window and the cashier asked me what I ordered. Are you serious?? Then she magically found my order and said it wasn't ready. What a waste of time! I will never go back to this Popeyes. They have horrible customer service and are slow as shit."}
{"text":"I've been to this location since they opened and so far have had my order right just once. It's just a block from where I live so it's very convenient for me. If it's not one thing it's another with them, from forgetting my apple pie(S), waiting for the chicken to cook, my drinks, and more. It just never fails with this location, something always goes wrong. I thought it was just me but looking at past reviews I just had to give mine. Get it together Popeyes! 2 ** because I love your chicken !"}
{"text":"This placed made me wait to long to even order and while I was there waiting 3 ppl including the manager asked the lady waiting to get her order if she had already ordered and didn't even acknowledge me steer clear of this one and drive a bit farther or go down the street as I did to kfc ain't coming back to this one"}
{"text":"Crispy, crunchy, juicy, hand battered chicken marinated in Louisiana seasonings = one happy belly.

Whether you are a fan of Popeyes' mild or spicy recipe, 
It is sure to satisfy your hunger cravings.

4 Stars overall due to prompt service. I was in and out pretty quickly and the food was piping hot. Chicken was cooked perfectly- crisp on the outside and juicy, moist on the inside. Seasoning is delicious and I especially enjoy the fact that their chicken isn't as greasy as other fried chicken establishments.

I must add that the cost was a bit higher than your average Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen locations but what else would you expect from any business located in an airport."}
{"text":"Slow service, got my order wrong, was asked to go park, forgot my drink, since I was asked to park they didn't give any dipping sauces. There was no one in the drive thru before or after me. Employees act like I'm inconveniencing them. It's a shit show start to finish. At least my food was hot."}
{"text":"If you are talking about the chicken alone it deserves a 3 pretty decent for fast food fried chicken and the biscuits are decent for fast food as well. In fact when fresh they are above average...for fast food. Where it goes completely down hill after that is the customer service. I visited this location last night using the drive thru. When I arrived it was 9:25. I ordered a family meal of spicy chicken and I was told \"we are out of spicy chicken\" translation...its getting late and we don't wanna make any more. Ordered regular chicken and 6 biscuits. When I get to the drive thru window the girl at the door has her purse on her shoulder...it was confusing. She tells me it will be 7 minutes for biscuits. I say \"oh ok well since your making biscuits could they make spicy chicken since we have to wait anyway\" she says \" well we are about to close\" now its 9:30 and if I do math correct you have 30 minutes to close...but if you already have your purse on your shoulder then...there was two people in front of me and two people in drive thru behind me. As I am.waiting in parking lot for my biscuits I see her come out and jump in a car...her ride waiting I suspect...it takes 6-7 more minutes for my biscuits...the life of fast food."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Not quite the Popeyes Chicken and Biscuits from hell but close. The area behind the counter is often cluttered with stuff on the floor. You walk in and are the only customer inside and the counter person is completing a drive thru order while another employee is behind the register talking to another employee sitting in the table area obviously on break, not started or have just finished his shift. They chat while I stand, the other employee is still helping the drive through customer and no one has even acknowledge my presence. I say in disgust \"ARE YOU OPEN! Only then does the female behind the register acknowledge me and tells me that the employee doing the drive through will be with me shortly, upon which, The chatter scurried somewhere out of view. When she completed my order and gave me my receipt she tossed it on the counter and the penny change hit the floor where I left it and walked out Shaking My Head. Horrendous customer service! And just one of many bad encounters at this location, which is why I only go there about once every four months hoping to see some changes. But no, same oh same oh."}
{"text":"Love the food...but the service! According to my receipt, the server was Terry.  When I started my order, she told me that she noticed the last time I was there I didn't throw away my food before I left and I needed to do that.  When they called my number they used the word \"guest\" but this did not make me feel like a guest.  I have never known a restaurant that forces the eater to bus their own table unless they worked there.  Seeing as I don't have a Popeye's uniform and am not paid my Popeye's to bus tables...I am pretty sure I don't work there.  In college, I did work fast food and know that workers prefer the customers to do their work for them, but to tell a customer he had to is outrageous!"}
{"text":"A tiny Popeyes store tucked at the corner of a strip mall. We ordered butterfly shrimp ($5.99) and the Friday special Cajun Poutine ($3.59) The service was excellent and food portion size is reasonable. The price is slightly on the expensive side for the butterfly shrimp. I would return again"}
{"text":"I was excited to have a Popeyes in the Gilbert area but now that excitement has quickly left after receiving cold fries, cold extra dried out chicken tenders and a lost order. 

Opening day was Thursday, July 2nd, needless to say there where a lot of bodies but the bodies where not placing orders but instead where taking and preparing the orders. I counted 12 workers in the back and many seemed confused, I think the confusion came from the management team that was showing the workers what to do and how to do it which from what I could see caused a few wrong orders to be giving out such as mine. I ordered a 16pc mixed family meal and I received an 12pc non-mixed order with cold fries.

I returned on Saturday to place three orders with one of those orders being Chicken Tenders and the tenders where cold and dried and once again the fries where cold. But on a positive note the Chicken (non-tenders) that was provided on each visit was fresh, hot and great. I think they may be preparing too many tenders and fries estimating their need for the items and they are falling short in that area so they are serving cold and dry fries & tenders.

Lessons learned: Always check orders & always ask for fresh fries & tenders."}
{"text":"It's fast food so you already know it's greasy and unhealthy but it's a craving we can't avoid sometimes. The manager was sitting out in the dining area cursing up a storm. He would say the F bomb like it was a part of normal workplace vocabulary. Glad my kid wasn't with us because it was so inappropriate and uncomfortable. Probably won't make the mistake of visit this location again. Extremely unprofessional especially for that place."}
{"text":"The food was pretty gross, but somehow also delicious. Kinda unfortunate that there was more breading than chicken in the chicken tenders, but at least they made up for it by somehow giving us two pounds of sugar in a one pound drink."}
{"text":"This location does not offer daily specials, but the Maryland Parkway location does. They also don't seem very bright, but the portions seem bigger here than other locations I go to.  They do the Tuesday 99 cent deal for 2 pieces, which is a real bargain.  The regular menu is kinda pricey, so I'm stickin with the Wicked Chicken Basket for $3.99 whenever it's in season.  I miss the Popcorn Chicken special.  I always ask for spicy, and sometimes they mess up and give me regular.  Oh well.  :-P"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time ever and left hungry and disappointed. Ordered 2pc combo for me and fish and shrimp for my husband. We waited for 15-30 minutes while this guy played around with 2 boxes we discovered were ours when we asked about our food and they said they lost the ticket. Of course, it was cold already. They gave me 2 tiny pieces of chicken (mostly skin) and I was lucky. My husband got 2 even tinier pieces of fish and 1 shrimp. ONE! 

Terrible service."}
{"text":"So I think they are not a corporate store , that little old man I think he is the owner , charged me 5 cents for the bag and 25cents for using the debit card without telling me first and  I never got charged from other location btw. and very bad attitude. Also the price in this store is bit higher than the other location as well for example the biscuit. The girls who work there are much nicer than the old little man from m"}
{"text":"I had previously dismissed low ratings since I had usually favorable visits.  
Today was an exception.  I ordered a \"Family 8 Piece\" with coleslaw and greenbeans.  
When I arrived home with the food, the green beans and biscuits were cold (this is a 5 minute trip, people!)  Upon closer examination, the order contained 2 breast half; 2 drumsticks, one thigh and three wings.  Now, this technically fits the definition of 8 pieces mixed, I have never before had a wing substituted for a thigh (the norm).  
I tried to call the establishment, and was sent to voice mail:  \"Sorry this mail box is full.\"
Seriously, you need some franchise attention to this location."}
{"text":"Shoulda known... wife came here on a Tuesday evening and after ordering a family meal was told to pull up and wait. Over 15 minutes later they brought the meal out to her. Sorry, but it doesn't take that long to fry up a batch of chicken. And almost every Popeye's plays this \"pull up and wait\" game. It gets old! At least the chicken always tastes good."}
{"text":"Not the brightest bunch working here. I usually have to repeat my order enough times to where I'm looking for the Candid Camera crew to appear at any moment. Every time I visit, the food comes out hot...no better way to eat those biscuits! The chicken tenders are always crunchy, tasting better than KFC, but not as good as Chick Fila or Raising Canes. All-in-all, a tastier alternative to the usual fast food fare in the area."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I got there right at 11 AM and someone saw me from the kitchen but did not open up. When they finally opened up a few minutes later, the guy told me they \"weren't ready\" which no DUH you aren't ready because you wait for us to order before you cook the food? I let this go though. When I ordered my sandwich and asked for ketchup inside it they said they \"don't do that.\" STEP UP YOUR SERVICE OR CUSTOMERS WILL GO ELSEWHERE. RIDICULOUS STAFF. They need to be properly trained!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this popeyes chicken! I went in drive-through and ordered a three-piece all white meat meal, no drink. The person that had taken my order was very nice and pleasant and the lady at the window was also nice and pleasant. So when I received my food I gave her a $2 tip. I drove home and I opened the box and noticed that I have a breast, wing and a leg that appeared to be chicken that was refried! I called popeyes and a guy told me he will replace my leg with a wing, I said for almost $8 I should have two breast and a wing. (ALL WHITE MEAT) he said it doesn't work like that because it's a meal deal. So I said that's fine I understand how it works so I would like to return my meal for a refund. I didn't want to go into detail about how old and dry my meal looked.

Service 4
Communication 1
Quality of food -5
Waste gas & time -5

Oh yeah, I asked for my tip back!!!

Just in case, for all that may think that I was wrong ...they all knew when they gave me my meal that, my food was old & very poor looking! SMH"}
{"text":"Workers constantly forget my dipping sauce, not a one time occasion. When I remind them about the sauce, they say it's 50 cents. Isn't it supposed to come with the meal? Any other respectable restaurant gives 1-2 dipping sauces without forgetting or customers having to constantly remind them. Workers also have an attitude when you tell them they forgot something, as if you did something wrong. They should accept the mistake and correct it instead of trying to argue.

Service is exceptionally slow as well. Not many customers at one time and yet an average order will take 15-20 minutes, there's no excuse for that."}
{"text":"Wow is all i can say! If i could give them a Neg score i would!! My family and i have been going here cuz the food is great.. Now as for the Staff well thats another story. Today my husband waited for over 41mins for 5 combo meals, the staff left this young kid alone and he had no idea what to do.. Another customer was banging on the drive thru window to get someone to take her order cuz they wouldnt answer her on head-set, lobby was full of ppl wondering where their food was and NOT ONE MGR IN SIGHT to help. 
When i called the mgr on duty to complain cuz the Food was cold esp the fries, she told me there was nothing she could do except give me the email address to corp and i could ask them for a refund?! R u kidding me?? Thats what u call customer service?! Id rather drive to next location then ever come back to Durango site!!"}
{"text":"Second time in a row I've come here and they're out of wings how is that possible??? They don't close for another hour and a half! The drive thru is always extremely slow too. I'll skip this location next time"}
{"text":"-Service and order was prompt
-ordered 4 Tuesday specials 
-chicken not fully cooked
-chicken is too dark of what it normally should be, oil is not changed frequently enough to save money."}
{"text":"I waited 18 minutes for my chicken and fries. Fries were cold and p shitty.  Honesty, if I would've written this review right after I'd eaten there, I would've been p bad.  But it's been a few days and the buffalo chicken was actually v lit so fuck it 4/5!"}
{"text":"With the recent demise of Melly Mel's, I was on the prowl for a fried chicken option on Madison's south side.  Short of time, I decided to check out the Popeye's on Fish Hatchery Road after glancing over Miss Joyce's favorable review.  While it won't ever supplant Harold's as my fave fried chicken joint, Popeye's delivered a decent meal at a reasonable price.

I opted for the Blackened Chicken Box (chicken tenders, fries and a biscuit), which set me back a mere $3.99.  I received nine tenders, with six being about the size of a quarter and three normal sized pieces.  I enjoyed the seasoning, which supplied a hint of spiciness, but was not a fan of the overly chewy texture.  While not freshly made, the fries offered a terrific exterior crunch and decent seasoning.  The biscuit was small, salty and a little doughy - it could have used a condiment to spruce up the flavor.

Other observations and ramblings:
* The restaurant appears fairly well maintained with freshly painted walls.  The tabletops were generally clean, but there was some debris on the floor.  To the credit of the staff, they later came through the dining are and swept up the floors. 

* The flat screen TV in the dining area beamed NFL Network programming to the patrons at a louder than usual volume level.

* The staff efficiently handled the steady stream of lunchtime customers.  While the staff was not overly friendly, I felt they were courteous and kept wait times to a minimum.

* For completing their on-line survey, Popeye's offers a free two-piece meal with a biscuit with the purchase of a soda."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times so I don't know why I keep coming back. Because they almost never get my order correct. The people on the other hand are very nice."}
{"text":"Just waiting 20 minutes in the drive Thur because the car in front of me ordered fresh made food and would not pull to the front. Now my food was cold and the manager didn't have enough skill the explain how other customers are impacted by blocking the lane. I was pissed at the incompetence. My food was cold and the side order was wrong. I want my money back and a apology"}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would!!! We went through the drive through after a 15 hour work day and were told to go park they would bring our order out. We waited and waited and waited some more. Over 20 minutes she came out and asked if ONE sandwich was ours and we said no we had three combo meals. Mind you our drinks are completely watered down at this point. She took our receipt and never came back! Complete waste of money and will never come back here again."}
{"text":"So. Slow. Second try at the drive through, waited 45 minutes, never got to order. After all of that wasted time and gas, all we got out of it was accosted by a homeless man. There will not be a third attempt."}
{"text":"First of all the drive thru line was pretty busy and they were taking forever with each car so I thought to myself they must be preparing everything it must be fresh. When I finally got to the window the lady didn't even apologize for the wait or anything and I got my food faster than others. Well when I finally got home my shrimp po boy was spilled all over the bag. It's the most sloppy sandwich I've had. The bread is dry it's kinda hard. It just looks like they put no effort into it. Super dissapointed. 
Don't go to this Popeye's. Find one in the ghetto instead. Tastes way better than this trash"}
{"text":"I rolled by for Tuesday chicken deal.  I always loved Popeyes.  Brianna and Angel were very polite and helpful.  The food was great and served quickly.  The only thing is that lobby could have used a quick cleaning, but it was the end of the night and the doors were closing.

I will definitely come back again for the food and hospitable service...."}
{"text":"I'm currently on the Keto Diet and was stuck on Bloor St. and hungry. There's tons of options with this diet so I quickly went to yelp for some suggestions.  I then went to google and was suggested by the keto community to do Popeyes' chicken naked.

I know it sounds ridiculous because you're going for that crispy breading and spices, but since the chicken itself is heavily marinated for a long time there's lots of flavour in the chicken itself.  The community noted that it's an off menu item and unfortunately only in the US...

Anyways, when I arrived the staff were very nice and understanding and agreed to accommodate my request.  I ordered chicken wings (naked) and the blackened cream sauce for dipping 

The staff even asked once the wings were done if I wanted them soft or crispier, I chose crispier.

The final result was some EXCELLENT little wings - I myself was shocked of how much better they tasted and I even enjoyed the breading in the past.   There's definitely magic to how they marinate the chicken and I didn't feel they were too greasy or feeling heavy after. It was just a perfect snack to tie me over until I could get home.  

I'm more pleased with just how accommodating the staff was because it's clearly an unusual request but perfect for someone who is on Keto"}
{"text":"Most Popeye's are pretty good. Sometimes you run into a bad one. I just moved into the hood. My old one in Texas was absolutely horrible. I noticed the drive through line was really long and thought... must be a good one! Went in to avoid the long drive through. One cashier. Ten minutes in line to place order. I was good with that. But then it happened. The wait. As I watched all these people (many!) who ordered after me leaving with their food, I asked if they lost my order. We are going to need another 6-7 minutes. We are going to need another 6-7 minutes. We are going to need another 6-7 minutes. I finally demanded my money back. Manager was very polite. She asked me what she could do to make it right. I said just get me my food! 6-7 minutes later... I had food. My family meal and extras was bumped up with an apple pie. Oh boy! Get home, buscuits are missing.

So the food was on par with what I expect from a fast food Popeyes, but there was nothing fast about it. Foods on par, but there processes are broken."}
{"text":"The worst fast food place I've evet been to"}
{"text":"I cannot comment on how the food tastes because they left me waiting in the parking lot for 15 minutes. By the time I went inside to see what was the hold up, I heard the girl cooking ask what was my order and the window lady replied \"I don't even know\". They hadn't even started my order! I had to go back to work HANGRY and no food! The manager has the worst customer service I have ever seen!  She did not even attempt to make it right. My comment is based entirely on service. I give 1 star for the pregnant employee who seems to be the only one who seems to know what customer service really is! Horrible! Stay far away from this location!"}
{"text":"Out of wings I was asked did I want to substitute 3 legs for the same price....really.  Staff not curteous."}
{"text":"Great quick service !
Tried the busy drive thru and it was super fast.
Excited to have one near our home."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we finally got a Popeyes in the city so not have to drive so far.  This place has best fried chicken around here, but the key is to wait 11 mins and have them make it fresh for you.  Always awesome that way!!!  I will be here often."}
{"text":"I was happy to see a new Popeye's in Central Phoenix.  Always drove to 32nd Ave and Greenway to get chicken and often it was barely warm by the time I got back to 16th St and Camelback.  This seemed like a great thing, but....

I stopped in for the first time here about 4 weeks ago.  I saw a sign for the fried shrimp tackle box.  I got the item and it was pretty tasty.  Next time I was in the area about 2 1/2 weeks ago, I ordered the same.  This time they were \"sold out\".  It was around 8:30 so chalked it up to sale of a good thing and lateness of the evening.  

Next time was about 1 1/2 weeks ago.  It was about 2:30 in the afternoon.  I was having a late lunch.  Well, ordered the Shrimp Tackle box,  Again, sold out.  I thought that was odd since it was so early in the day.  I opted to try the 5 piece spicy chicken tenders.  I get to the window and was handed my order.  I noticed no sauce in bag and was not asked if I wanted any.  I asked for BBQ and Ranch.  I got one of each.  I got home and ate.  The chicken was so dry, no amount of sauce would correct that.  The outside was hard and dry too.  I ate 2 and tossed the rest.

Tonight was the 3rd time trying to get the Shrimp.  Again, sold out.  WTF.  This is a new restaurant and they have been \"sold out\" 3 times.  This time I was irritated.  I went in a spoke to the night manager - an Asian woman.  I explained my previous visits and the lack of product.  I explained the chicken tenders were so dry, one could not eat them.  I asked for number to corporate and I will call tomorrow about this.  I had tried to call before driving all the way up there, but even the number on Yelp for the store was wrong.  She did provide the store number. 

I cannot understand why the management of the store does not order proper/adequate inventory of an item that is repeatedly selling out.  Seems to me they would want to ensure inventory and make the sale.  No product, no income.  Simple economics to me.  I am not sure if I will try this store again, perhaps just continue to make it a treat and go to my regular location (even though much further) as they always had what I wanted to order available."}
{"text":"Look, I am extremely firm with customer service. Mind you, I mess with popeyes heavy. I drove the drive thru and tried to order a chicken po boy. I received nothing but attitude when the response was, \"we ain't got dem no mo\". I asked for 2 chicken wraps but really wanted 3 so I reordered 3. Pulled around to the window to have lips smacked at me. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME!?!?! If you don't want to do your job quit. Don't smack your lips at me. The chicken wrap was banging. I appreciate that. The girl with the braces and glasses with the attitude....fix that yall. I need happy employees to enjoy a happy meal."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stopped here after our grocery trip. We ordered our meal and paid, once we got the receipt we noticed the order was wrong. My fiancé asked if it was what we ordered and the guy started arguing with him! He then told my fiancé \"Maybe next time you should read the menu\" before fixing the order. Extremely childish. Plus, he didn't give us our BLACKENED RANCH."}
{"text":"This would be a 4 star review (for airport food) except for the complete and total fuck job pricing. Are you honestly telling me that a breakfast sandwich and iced tea is $12???????????   

TWELVE DOLLAS????     

Whatever, I'm expensing it but come on these are crazy prices for what is $5 elsewhere. My sandwich was fast-food tasty meaning they charged me TWELVE dollars for like $1 in food costs.

Who says the Mafia doesn't still run Vegas?"}
{"text":"I frequent this part of town about every other week and I make it a point to stop by popeyes to get my fried chicken fix. The food and only the food are worth the visit. It is poorly managed and the employees are consitently rude."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY SLOW.  Poor customer service.
At 7 PM on Friday evening, only one register open!  Nothing fancy ordered, just fried chicken to go, but had to wait 16 minutes for order to be filled, even though there was plenty of fried chicken sitting under the heat lamps behind the counter.  Employee kept filling orders coming after my order number.  When I pointed this out and asked for my order, not even an apology was offered.  Another customer next to me complained about the same thing."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my dining experience.  The staff was way to ready to close and it was only 910, they don't close til 10.  The food was pretty old and not very good.  I am usually very satisfied with this location. Not sure what happened tonight."}
{"text":"Yes, it's fast food.  But it's CHICKEN!  and it's Popeye's Chicken!  This location just opened after an interminable wait.  I mean, really, it was like a year after announcing it.  Anyway, I'm a fan of Popeye's in general and apart from the random burrito stand, this is about all the fast food I will eat.

I was out of town the day they opened, but had been driving past the previous several weeks, since there was no announcement, no signage, nothing on the website about it, I just had to wait.  Well, it was worth it.

If you like fried chicken fast, this is the place to go. Forget those other places.  This is it.  I rolled in late Sunday after returning from a weekend in the desert.  Finally, I get my Popeyes fix.  My family thinks I'm just weird, but whatever.  They were not very busy, but they were fully staffed.  I placed a large order, family style and ordered chicken, shrimp, fries and the usual sides, red beans and rice and coleslaw.  Our order was packaged up and we dragged it back to the homestead for a feast.

Damn! as soon as we unpacked the vittles, my daughter noticed the fries were missing.  NOT a good start.  I called the store, as it was too far to drive back and get them.  Somebody told me I would be \"put on a list\" and they would \"remember me\".  I'm very dubious of that happening.  Next time, I will check the order right there before leaving.

Apart from that little slip-up, everything was delicious and we quickly scarfed the meal."}
{"text":"Just left here and they're out of everything, how does Popeye's run out of chicken? thats like Subway running out of bread...find another location besides this one."}
{"text":"Well you know Popeyes. This Popeyes is new and on their game. Chicken comes out hot with all the classic spices you are familiar with. Crispy, flavorful and always a pleasure."}
{"text":"Hmm..seems the lobby is closed..no reason posted as to why.  Too early for that -c'mon 8pm on a Sat. No service"}
{"text":"horrible service!! 

slow slow slow and then lady front cashier has alot of atitude your almost scared they will do something to your order that you stand and watch them the entree time! 

if you call for pick up goodluck . they never answer calls ever there excuses is..there busy and couldn't!! yet when i was forced to come in and order seeing how slow dead place was. . i called just for the hell see if they will answer 3 employees all standing doing nothing and even having conversation not giving a damn about the phone call coming in. for this reason never coming to this location fast food suppose to be convenient that's why people phone for pick up . bad customer service. food was great can't go wrong but the customer service makes you want to boycott the location!"}
{"text":"We called in our order ahead of our arrival. We arrived much sooner than expected, when we walked in, they seemed to have misplaced our order, when it was finally found we paid and sat for at least 30 minutes, although we were told twenty minutes on the phone, five of which was spent driving there. 

They were busy at the time and really seemed ill prepared for it, there was a real lack of organization, which just added to the frustration of waiting there. 

I'll give them one thing though, the other location didn't even pick up the phone."}
{"text":"Good food, but some of the WORST service I have ever had at a fast-food restaurant!

Popeyes is a chicken franchise that has been around for several decades now. Recently, the chain opened up several more stores in the Vegas Valley. After coming to this particular store on more than a few occasions, I can safely say that probably wasn't a good thing.

What is it with fast food restaurants hiring idiotic staff? They have screwed up my order numerous times (I order a chicken nuggets kids meal and get home and find a DRUMSTICK in there instead!?) The staff are utterly clueless, and half the time they don't know the answers to the questions you ask them.

One time the person ringing my transaction had the audacity to say \"have a nice day\" as if dismissing me, BEFORE GIVING ME MY DRINKS AND CHEESECAKE. 

Expect to repeat your order several times, because they don't listen the first time. 

Go here if you like the franchise and their food, but go at your own risk, and double-check your order when you get it.

Food: B-
Service: D-"}
{"text":"This place has made me not want and dread going to Popeyes. I went today through the drive thru and first they stopped selling the family chicken meals. Like who does that. Then I complete my order , pull up to the window, and am not greeted with a smile, hello, good evening nothing!! I am a previous employee of Popeyes (las vegas) and we in orientation are told you greet every customer how you would wanted to be greeted. (If you have any self respect). Anyways, I got to the window and all that. I was given my drinks not even here is the coke and here is the blank etc. so I'm like okay, whatever. Then the girl (yes I say girl because only little girls have mannerisms like this) hands me the straws with her back turned towards me the whole time not even seeing where she is pointing the straws. Then I was given my food and I had to ask for sauces etc. I get to the park to eat with my family, don't have forks. I call the manager and tell her my complaints, she asked we'll do you know who it was. I said no it was the two black girls at the drive thru (not being racist or racial, didn't know their names) she said well there's more than one. And kept going back and forth with me. Unprofessional!! I tried to contact her before corporate but cmon why is the customer service so bad   It's not even in a bad area. It's in an ideal part of town across from the park. Like please change management or stop hiring teenagers that don't care about customer service."}
{"text":"Very very very very rude customer service. They forgot half  the order and when I went back to see a manager Alma the store manager was the rudest of them all. Even after showing her the receipt she still wanted to dispute the fact that they forgot half the order. She never said thank you. Never apologize for the inconvenience.  There are other Popeyes around Vegas. Do yourself a favor and don't go to this one. I will be calling corporate first thing in the morning. Alma customer service is not your gig maybe you need to find another job since your sooo unhappy with this one."}
{"text":"I have never eaten at a Popeyes and I was very happy with the tasty chicken 

I ordered a thigh ala cart

They gave me two small ones and a biscuit

My friend got one big thigh and a biscuit 

$2.70

Nice people work here and it was fast and fresh and hot And crispy"}
{"text":"Got the 3 piece chicken, mac and cheese, with a biscuit and sweet tea. Everything was good but I really should've just gotten the 1 piece chicken, mac and cheese, and biscuit. It was so filling and I couldn't finish it surprisingly (and I eat a lot). Not sure why there are such bad reviews here. Came here at 9pm and the cashier was so nice. She made some suggestions and brought our food out to our table. I was shocked because it was Popeyes and she didn't have to do all of that!! Such a sweet heart!"}
{"text":"This is my usual go-to place when I'm feeling hungry. I'd recommend Popeyes to anyone -- the chicken tenders are exceptional. Soft white meat, not dry, and consistently amazing. I did get overcooked tenders once, to the point where it was like chewing rubber, but that was once out of dozens of orders, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"This Popeye's is located just West of Thickson road on Dundas street and can be difficult to spot if you aren't driving down Dundas, so keep your eyes peeled. As well, the parking lot is small and often packed, so if you drive a big car, you may spend some time circling if the plaza is busy.

My boyfriend and I came here on a Friday night after driving around Whitby looking for something to eat. There was someone waiting at the counter to take our order right away and after we perused the menu for a bit, he decided on chicken tenders and I ended up with a shrimp combo. One thing I did see that I liked was that the counter staff upsold us on apple pies (which I might have been eyeing before she said anything) and when she told us the price, we were sold! We sat down while we waited for our food and a line began to form at the counter as it was dinnertime. We got our food after a surprisingly long wait (considering there was only one person ahead of us) and headed home. 

My shrimp was super tasty, great flavor, nice and spicy and the fries were really good too. I think you get quite a bit of food from Popeyes and it makes the cost worth it. I think its a tad more expensive than KFC, but then again, KFC doesn't have as many options and they certainly don't offer shrimp! The apple pie was a super nice end to the dinner as well, a splurge but well worth it.

The only comment I have about this particular location is that its ridiculously cold!! It was pretty cold outside and when we stepped in, I expected to warm up since there are deep friers and hot food behind the counter but it was SO cold in the restaurant! Probably because most of the outer walls are glass, but I didn't take my coat off and I couldn't wait to get out of there!

Otherwise, the food tasted as it usually does (another reliably good fast food chain), prompt, pleasant service, and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have never written a bad review about a place in all my life, but i could not believe the people that work here! Wowowowow....

I ordered 30 dollars worth of food and when i got home, my \"cajun rice\" was a big cup full of gravy and hair with some white rice sprinkled on top to make it look like rice!

I wrnt back and talked to everyone there but no one would fess up and a couple of them were laughing at me!

Kiss my ass!"}
{"text":"Waited at the drive-thru speaker for 15 mins with no communication. Horrible service. Ordered red stick snd and got something completely different. This place employs some of the dumbest kids I've ever seen. They have ZERO customer service skills. Quit smoking weed at work."}
{"text":"If it was possible to give a restaurant negative stars this place would get -5! The employees are always talking and make you wait 20+ minutes to take your order, and their debit/credit machine is always \"broken\" DO NOT EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe the service we received. We checked our order at the window and was missing part of it. The guy running the drive thru acted like we were insane that he didn't put in the bag. Once he had me open the boxes to show him it was missing, he grabbed the rest of our order and threw it in a bag to give us. 

No forks. No straws. No napkins. No dipping sauces. 

Rude."}
{"text":"The winner of the worst cutomer service restaurant. They don't take American Express. The casher is very rude and obnoixius. I would never eat there again."}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I had a two hour layover here and decided to get a quick bite to eat before it got too late. Popeye's wasn't busy at all, so we were able to around right away. I knew airport prices are jacked, but this is ridiculous!!
Anyway, we went with the 12-piece family meal, which included 2 large sides and 6 biscuits (or was supposed to, at least). After 10 minutes or so, our food was ready!
We got the mild chicken (breast, thighs, wings, legs) and Cajun fries and cole slaw for the sides. The chicken was solid but they completely messed up the sides. They gave us a small of each of the sides and no biscuits! I was super disappointed. I went back and complained and they finally gave us a full large fries and 3 small cole slaws (I guess that's equivalent to a large). We were supposed to get 6 biscuits, but they only gave us 5. At this point, I was over it, so I let that last biscuit go.
The meal was super heavy (as expected); the fries were kind of cold, but it still held me over for a while. However, this meal along with 2 fountain drinks cost almost $50 - so not worth it! Don't eat here unless you absolutely have to."}
{"text":"This was the most disappointing meal I have had anywhere.  It took over 40 mins to get two three chicken tender meals.  They were out of coleslaw. The floor was sticky, staff seemed like they had no clue what they were doing.  I'm not even sure if what I wound up with could be called a chicken tender.  I have never in my life seen a chicken tender that was between 1/8\" and 1/16\" thick and looked it was run over by a steamroller, flat, thin and very dry. More like chicken leather. Wish I had asked for a refund.  I will never be back and will definitely tell all my friends not to visit this location - at least I hope it is only this location."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Hey it's Popeyes... Nothing special. Food was fresh and treated good.  If you want some chicken in the strip go in here. They are open 24 hrs."}
{"text":"It was me and my wife's first time at this Popeye's location and it wasn't good. We went through the drive through. We wanted the mild chicken but were told it'll be a twenty minute wait. My wife and I went with the spicy chicken, then we went home. The mashed potatoes we ordered as an extra side was never packed. Yes my wife and I should've checked the bag but I called the restaurant and was given a code and was told I can pick up the side item another day. I was nice with my approach. After seeing all these negative reviews my wife and I will continue going to this location but we'll be aware. Next time I'll stop into the place and see how the service is. All places have their good and bad employees."}
{"text":"Usually love this place..  but they gave me the oldest driest chicken this last visit. I ended up throwing it away."}
{"text":"VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! WILL NOT BE BACK!!
ordered a 4 piece mild strip meal for my 2 kids got to pick up window was handed a box in no to go bag. I opened box and no strips it was 4 pieces of chicken. They guy at window said we dont sell 4 piece strip meal I said why didnt they tell me when I ordered he said I didnt take ur order. I said fine i asked for the 3rd time is it mild he said yes. Needless to say my kids diner was ruined and I just dumped 10.00 in the trash it was spicy not mild. My 5 & 6 year old has a burning mouth and 2 bites each of mac n cheese for diner THANK YOU VERY MUCH POPEYES for ruining my kids diner"}
{"text":"I love the service here!

Chicken here is a hit or miss... sometimes dry and sometimes great
I normally get the Cajun poutine and it is always good.

I wish the fork provided was better... it's serves as a fork/ spoon.

They have daily specials so check them out!"}
{"text":"Every single time we come here, they never get our order correct.
There is always one thing that is incorrect. 
Ordered fries and we get beans and rice. 
Our receipt even clearly states fries.
It's just frustrating always getting an incorrect order."}
{"text":"20 mins still waiting on 2 3 pieces boxes. Orders after us have been taken care of, big orders have been taken care of . This Lil order forgotten...??? Very bad experience.  Manger & a employee aruging.."}
{"text":"My husband raves about this place all the time so I figured I would try it while I was in Tempe today. I haven't been to a Popeyes since high school and wasn't expecting much. But this place was awesome. They had lots of staff on hand so the line moved quickly and the place was clean. Everyone was working and they didn't have employees hanging out talking like some places do. Everyone seemed to have a purpose and enjoy working together. Also, all of the employees were friendly!!! That doesn't always happen. I asked a couple questions about the menu and they didn't act annoyed. That shouldn't be a big deal but it is. 
Our food was perfect. Chicken was tender and crunchy. The mac n cheese was creamy and delicious. My little guy loved the mashed potatoes. The biscuits were hot and fresh. 
As I was leaving the restaurant an employee was talking the trash out. He noticed a homeless looking man on the side of the building and asked him if he would like a drink. The man said yes and the employee said he would be right back with one. I had to get home so I didn't see what happened but I thought it was a really nice thing to see an employee notice someone in need and offer them something as simple as a drink. 
Clean restaurant, delicious food, and kind employees - I will be back."}
{"text":"Say what you want about them!
Go in and get the chicken with red beans and rice!
Nuff said!

Apparently NOT nuff said! Lol. Inside joke.

The Red Beans and Rice with one chicken piece is enough for me, but they offer meals for healthier appetites too.
 The drive thru can be slightly awkward if you're trying to get back to Oakey off Jones, and parking lot is a little small. So far I haven't had a problem but I imagine at rush hour it can be a iffy thing.
 The chicken is spicy, I can't wait to try their spicy variety, while I'm eating with my mom and toddler I settle for regular.
  The chicken alone always seems a little greasier than some chicken places, the red beans and rice cut it a lot.
Place is averagely clean, everyone's polite. N vet had an issue."}
{"text":"They food is AMAZING but the service is horrible and the place is so dirty. There were bugs crawling everywhere made us loose out appetite. I love me some Popeyes chicken but not when the place is this dirty. I've worked at a Popeyes before so I know how exhausting it can get but c'mon!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Our cashier had great recommendations. We had the family chicken meal with Cajun fries and macaroni - so delicious! This store is always clean and staff go above and beyond"}
{"text":"Their sweet tea is always something nasty haha, can never get an order right. Just make sure you are on your order when you go."}
{"text":"First time in a long time ive been to a Popeyes chicken due to bad service and poor quality like the one on Baseline and Priest and the other on Broadway in Mesa, but seen this one and decided to give it a try its new. Glad i did service was good chicken was good and the greeting at the door and order taker was friendly and order was up quick. Chicken cooked right and sides also. I review exactly to what i see at time of visit and it was a good visit. I will be back again to this location for more.."}
{"text":"THIS Popeye location is more of a joke then a restaurant . Getting it wrong from what I read is there specialty. Wow it managed PRETTY bad it seems like they have somewhere else they need to be and asking and PAYING  for you should get is WELL GOOD LUCK.. I don't recommend this location I had Popeyes in California and it was real good but all the ones I eat at here just don't measure up . Greasy chicken beyond normal and the prices are also creeping into being to expensive for the experience and quality. They had a ton of people working but hard for them to get it done and it wasn't busy. Music going but no one home."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through tonight and ordered the 16 piece tenders meal... $34 for the meal. When I asked how many total dipping sauces came with a 16 tenders I was told only 4. I asked for a few extra and was told I would have to pay for them.  I explained that when I order a 5pc I get 2 sauces so how could it be logical to give only 4 for a 16 meal that more than a family of 4 would be eating. The rude manager then came to the window and told me if I wanted them I could pay and that they were just following policy. 
This was after I had previously swore off going back due to incorrect orders more than 3 times. On those occasions they told me that I didn't order correctly because I should have ordered by number instead of saying 3pc tender because they could get confused between bone in and tenders."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday for their dollar something deal. You get a wing and a thigh. The workers there are really nice and friendly. They joke around with you too. My friend introduced me to a new side, jambalaya rice with chicken and sausage. It's delicious!!! The sides are a little small but it was flavorful, spicy, warm and satisfying. Definitely try it out next time!!"}
{"text":"Yes... I went to Popeye's for dinner tonight.  I had a craving for popcorn shrimp and it was the closest thing to satisfy my hunger.  Is it just me or are their portions shrinking?  My popcorn shrimp was good and finger-lickin' greasy like I expected, but I could have eaten 3 times the amount! I guess that explains why they don't have a kid's menu and my boyfriend's son couldn't get a damn toy! They have obviously melded the two menus together and now I get to pay $6.95 for a combo that is kid-sized."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place a -5 I would!! Popeyes franchise in this location is being represented in the most unprofessional manner! There is one car in the parking lot waiting for their food and I have been here for 30 minutes waiting for 12 pieces of chicken!! It's supposed to be fast food and it's very frustrating to be waiting and I keep waiting for my food!! And it's not like the place has a lot of people waiting in line, not outside nor inside! It's sad that I'm not the first one to post this conversation and these owners are doing nothing to raise awareness of unprofessional service!! Next step, would be to send a formal complaint to corporate!! The issue is with the staff and I  sure of this because other Popeyes are way better when it comes to the service and effectiveness of their business!"}
{"text":"This has to be the WORST food place in the valley!!! We waited 45 minutes for our order. They literally screwed up every single persons order in line and the drive thru. People were not getting receipts for anything. The staff was the rudest I have ever seen. These owners are going to loose their restaurant because of their crappy employees. Good luck you won't be around long."}
{"text":"This has to be the slowest Popeyes on the planet. This is my 2nd time visiting this location but never again. As I waited for my order, one person came back and said his order was wrong. The young man preparing the orders was walking around looking confused  about the orders. There was a line inside with 1 cashier taking orders. The drive-thru cashier was complaining because cars were driving off due to the wait. I finally asked for a refund. Once I got a refund, the 2 people that ordered before me, requested a refund. On Sunday afternoon, this place need to have extra staff to handle the church flow."}
{"text":"So today my thigh tasted dry not so tasty and juicy. I order a large fry and they gave me small. This is my second time ever coming to Popeyes and it wasn't a good one knowing my 4 combo meal was expensive cause I ordered fries on the side. Thanks for the second worse experience."}
{"text":"As far as fast food places go, Popeyes is bomb-diggity.  I love, love, love the fact that they feature a Cajun theme to their food.  I love their Cajun season salt that you can add to everything.  Their \"Cajun Sparkle\" may be a more generic version of Tony Chachere's Cajun Seasoning, but once you've gotten hooked on this condiment (which is ubiquitous in Louisiana), it is heartening to find it available.

My favorite thing about Popeye's is the spicy chicken.  It usually is more flavorful and juicier than the Colonel's anyways (Oh... how the mighty have fallen!).  I also like that they offer crawfish dishes seasonally, yet I somehow always seem to time it wrong and not make it in during that window.  My current understanding is that they offer these goodies in November, including crawfish po'boys and crawfish etouffee! I must be more vigilant so that I can scrabble them mudbugs up in my chops!  Just try to find another fast food place that dares to put \"etouffee\" on their menu... I dare you, dammit!

Anyhow... little known fact for all you Cajun food fans out there.  You can buy Cajun-seasoned deep-fried turkeys at Popeyes during the holidays.  We picked up out Thanksgiving turkey at this store and were thrilled to death with it.  It is fully cooked and frozen when you get it.  And it's not terribly cheap... $50 for a 12-lb bird (or so).  But it is delicious! Still requires about two hours of cooking time... all the instructions are included.  Be aware these sell out fast. Having nearly missed the boat (last Thxgiving, I got the last bird at this store), I would look no later than two weeks before Thanksgiving to get your turkey.  And call them beforehand to be sure. Not every store carries holiday Turkeys.  I can't tell you if they offer these for Christmastime, neither.

So be forewarned, Pilgrim!"}
{"text":"Was having a hankering for comforting, fast food and I was exhausted after working for 12 hours so what better way than Popeyes!

I've visited this location via drive-thru and inside, found service to be actually good for a fast food place. In terms of the people working they have been pleasant and quick. I've been all about the $5 box which comes with either two pieces of chicken or three tenders and two sides of your choice and a biscuit. I got the Spicy Tenders with Mash, Mac & Cheese and Cajun Fries before. The Tenders are so juicy, tender and with a crispy, crunchy exterior. The mash is always my favorite, the mac tastes premade (noodles are mush) and the Cajun Fries tasted way too stale for my liking. The biscuits are so good and I was lucky enough to grab some fresh ones that were just slathered with butter. The Sweet Tea is pretty good too, though not as good as Raising Cane's or Lolo's.

The chicken here is spot on and great for the price. Definitely easy on the wallet if you're a college student like myself!"}
{"text":"Always a problem with my order when I go here.  If it's not something missing it's something not cooked well.  I wish the service was better, we may actually frequent it more.  Looks like I'm good for another 12-18 months."}
{"text":"Stop by there for lunch today. Picked up 5 strips and 2 fish strips and fries. Took it to my shop and proceeded to eat it I was surprised to see that the breading was thicker than the chicken. The fries were almost cold and not very tasty. They are supposed to be cajun fries? I asked for some dipping sauces such as sweet and sour and honey mustard and some tartar sauce to go with the fish. Upon eating the food all that I could find in there was a couple of tartar sauce and some honey mustard no sweet and sour. I think I've ate there twice today my first and my last."}
{"text":"What can I say, I'm definitely going back. The chicken was hot well seasoned and the shrimp po'boy sandwich was good. The Sweet Tea was great and I had to get a gallon for the house. The beans and rice are on point as well.  Enough said I will be back for many many more visits. This should cover eating in the dinning room and drive threw. My son loves it too. Its a winner."}
{"text":"Why do they always seem to run out of the special flavors. Their excuse always seems to be \"the delivery truck hasn't showed up yet\"."}
{"text":"I ordered a pretty standard meal, the shift lead called my number and told me it would take a few minutes to have fresh chicken, Im cool with that, he hand delivered it to my at my seat. Food good as usual, staff are eager to please. 
Good enough to compel me to write this now."}
{"text":"Horrible. They forgot my tenders... WTF..??  Maybe they should charge after we review the food."}
{"text":"I got there at 10 20pm to make drive through order to get 8 pieces of chickens. Since i saw the review and it was quite bad, i tried not to have any expectation in this place. Order has been placed at 1123 and i got it on me at 1141 which took me exactly 18 minutes after i placed order. Since the customer in front of me took pretty long to place an order, i asked employees what she ordered, since it made me wait for 18 minutes. Employee told me that order has been pushed so they had to fry chickens all freshly, so i was thinking of having fresh chicken as what she mentioned. Chicken was fine but 2, two of them had some serious hardness and was really hard to chew, on the other hand, other 6 seemed to be freshly fried, tasty.  I would give 3 stars in this location because of the waiting and 2 chickens that I had.

Food : Okay I guess
Waiting : If u are looking for the \"Fast\"food, you came to the wrong place
Service : Its a fastfood restaurant... So I dont expect a good service. But i wish that the worker won't lie again

Do I recommend this place?
If u dont mind waiting for around 20 minutes in fast food restaurant, I would, otherwise, I won't"}
{"text":"20 minutes for drive thru, literally. I ordered and parked for a full 20 minutes before they brought it to my car, with a half apology for the time. I've worked in many restaurants and I am usually patient, but 20 minutes is far too long for drive thru fast food meh-quality food. Do not recommend"}
{"text":"30 min. in the drive thru. Then they tried to charge me $18 for a two piece meal that was $7.49. Then they lost my order and I had to reorder. So THAT girl disappeared and another one took over, and again tried to charge me $16!  I ordered a THIRD time.  Fortunately they have me a second drink, because they didn't know the first girl already gave me one, and I got a free piece of pie, because I was livid!  Check your orders people!!  She said everyone was new, but apparently no one got any training yet."}
{"text":"Been here several times and the experience is more often bad than good. It's located adjacent to a gas station in a sketchy  area. The food is ok but the service is obnoxiously slow. You'll find yourself idling in their drive through for 20+mins when it's not even busy. To top it off the people working there are simply rude. They will only acknowledge you're there to give you the food and take your payment. They are curt and seems to be doing whatever they can to get rid of you, short of working faster. There are faster places, with better food, and with better prices to get a quick bite. Especially after my most recent experience I won't be returning here again."}
{"text":"I always like this location. Really near my house. Always come over get my chicken fix. Now they even sell sandwich only 5.59 with side and Drink. 
At here Service are fast too.
Chicken always taste fresh and crispy.
I don't understand why this location only have 3 star. Most of Tuesday here is really really busy, because there 2 for $1.49 deal. Dinner room is clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to a Popeye's and am pleased. For fast food, it's tops. Got the popcorn shrimp with Cajon fries and biscuit with sweet heat sauce. Tasty all around. Biscuit was soft and delish, sauce was on point. Shrimp and fries were very good. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and place is very clean , owner takes allot of pride in his this place and every one is always so nice, I eat lunch here a couple times a week"}
{"text":"Staff is very professing and the food was super fresh even when we came her one night about 9 pm ..no wait food was hot fresh and was in and out with no problems..the management here really tales care of this place and their customers and it shows..the place is super clean and I will be back for more"}
{"text":"I have been turned out on Popeye's chicken for some time now and just can't get enough of it.  I also just got offered a 2nd shift team lead position to the new Popeye's that's coming May 9th Val Vista and Pecos.. so if you are in the area, I look forward to the comments..all about improvements"}
{"text":"Fairly disappointed with this location... not once, but on two separate occasions out of three our Cajun fries were not placed in our bag. On our most recent visit both the chicken tenders and popcorn shrimp were over cooked, trying to bite into them felt like the equivalent of chewing on a rock. The coleslaw was another letdown and had a strange minty aftertaste reminiscent of toothpaste or mouthwash. Needless to say we won't be back again to this one anytime soon."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. A couple times I think they gave us regular instead of spicy chicken in the drive through. Oh well....We still love the chicken here. It is very fast as well."}
{"text":"I LOVE Popeye's chicken!  KFC used to be my favourite fried chicken, but ever since I tried Popeye's five years ago, I can't go back to loving KFC anymore.  The wait at this location could be long sometimes when they're busy.  The tables are occasionally messy.  But generally the staff is nice and efficient.  Recently I place an order of 72 pieces of drumsticks with the manager, $130 including HST and delivery, what a great deal!  Not to mention he was patient with me phoning him a few times to adjust and confirm the order.  The delivery came through with piping hot chicken, the drumsticks disappeared in no time and everyone was satisfied with the delicious chicken."}
{"text":"\"Sorry, we don't have specials here.\"
Whaaaaat!!!!

Just spent the most on popeys chicken in one stop ever... $12 for 8 pieces. Yup, it's tuesday, but no 2 for 1.25 here. Really? Ok that's fine...just go to another one next time right? Guess living in Centennial Hills means we can afford a whole meal... we like deals too.  Gas or food, gas or food... Damn V8.

It's clean in here though. Better be for a brand new spot. Customer service is good(training paid off). Let's see how long that lasts. Wait time was bleh... Drive thru lines is mad crazy... 

It's nice to have one just down the street, but I think we all should get the same deal as well... got everyone here juked."}
{"text":"2 4 1 tuesdays whaaaaaaaa!
Sorry for the quick review.
Writing this as I sit in my car before I leave the parking lot. You know, hands free law. Even though I know I'll have the wheel in one hand and a leg in the other by the time I leave. Haha..

Bought
4 orders leg and thigh spicey/mild

It has been a ritual for us every Tuesday to come out to this location to get our 2 4 1 chicken special. Worth the trip everytime. Clean inside, and the staff always greets and friendly. Fast, and D-lish-us! Mmmmhmmm!

Now to the bat cave and make some rice before I get rained on. 

Come get your chicken on!"}
{"text":"Came here today Sunday around 7pm for dinner after church. Good fast service. I ordered a 12 piece chix only and they let me do leg n thigh instead of all combo. I think they wouldn't let me do that last time or with extra charge, but this time is all good. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I love Popeyes spicy chicken and biscut w. redbeans and rice!  Its crispy, and is just freaking good!  lol"}
{"text":"This is the worst Popeyes I have ever been to. 75% of the time they get the order wrong...either mild when I order spicy or white meat when I order dark. I don't know why I keep going back. I suggest ordering the opposite of what you want and maybe you'll actually get it in the end."}
{"text":"I have been in the Drive-Thru line for almost 20 minutes and I feel bad I have to write this review but then the service is just horrible here"}
{"text":"Good location, owners and workers are really nice and kept very clean!
For this Popeye's location the chicken is always nice a crispy, hot, and fresh! 
Ive been here multiple times and it stays consistent. I even asked to change a leg to a wing on the Tuesday special and they always do!  
Always get the fries :)"}
{"text":"Although this location (since it was in the airport) had a more limited menu, I am definitely a fan of popeyes. They have very good juicy chicken, catfish, love their rice and beans. I wish they had more locations throughout the city because they put kfc to shame.  This was my first time ordering breakfast from them (because I had a morning flight) and I ordered their chicken and biscuit and added an egg. WOW it was good.  I will say that their orange juice was very small though (maybe it's an airport thing, I don't know)  but I will definitely go back to any location"}
{"text":"Wow I was disappointed here for some reason.  I love popeyes chicken and decided to order the chicken wrap that has rice and beans inside, a side of cole slaw and of course the sweet tea.  The sweet tea was definitely not as sweet and yummy as it used to be and the chicken wrap was very very small (comparable to the mini breakfast burrito you'd get a McDonalds). The wrap was hot but it was just eh on taste.  The cole slaw I didn't like at all.  I felt that for almost $5 I didn't get my money's worth including the quality.  I will give them credit for how clean the place was and she was very nice behind the counter.  

However if this was my first visit, I would not return. I am not discouraged though, I will try them again. I will just order something different."}
{"text":"Waited several minutes during a short work break, only to find out they could only take cash. There was no signs at all at their drive thru menu. Had to wait several minutes more to leave, because there's no way to get out. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Food at big chains doesn't change too much but the service does. 

These people are not the friendliest and they don't have much patience."}
{"text":"The chicken here is one of my favorites from any other fast food place in town. Crispy and super-southern! They also have an extensive menu on side choices, from mashed potatoes to a few types of beans, coleslaw, and even mac n cheese (DING DING DING winner) 

While the food here is delicious, the service sucks. I've never come in to contact with so many people that hate their lives than I have at this particular location. You just walk into the place and the cashier gives you this snooty look of HOW DARE YOU COME HERE. Like, bitch please I just want some chicken not your first born child.

Never go through the drive-thru if you can, at this location either. I've only done it about 3 times, and EVERY GODDAMN time, they fucked up my order, or didn't give me a fork or some shit. Plus the girl running the drive-thru window has a shit ton of acne, super gross face. She'll make you lose your appetite."}
{"text":"What the cluck?! Something is seriously wrong with this Popeyes. Nine out of ten times they mess up. Wrong order. Wrong sauce. I've gotten lucky one time and received a larger order by mistake. Thank you for the payback universe! 

The quality is sub par and is overpriced. I paid almost $8 for 3 tiny shriveled chicken tenders. You can get better quality, juicy, tasty tenders at Raising Canes for a better price. 

I will say if you must eat here, stick with the fried chicken (wings, thighs, breast, whatevs). At least it's better than KFC. 

Beware, you've been warned. Check your bags in drive thru before leaving."}
{"text":"This is easily one of the slooooooooooowest places I have ever seen. Filled with employees that just stand around looking. They start on an order and then stop right in the middle and walk off. Half done orders sit there for extended periods. After I finally got my order, the guy taking orders just walked off leaving nobody to handle the customers coming in the door. He never came back. Customers walked out. The trash bins were absolutely stuffed and overflowing onto the floor. The tables and floor were also filthy. Judging by the other reviews, clearly management should be replaced. IDIOTS! Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"Horrible experience from beginning to end and every place in between. Completely inappropriate conduct including loud, obnoxious, offensive, boisterous racket including profanity coming from the kitchen crew and Team Leads, WHILE you're standing at the counter observing and hearing it all. Brand-new restaurant already showing signs of neglectful cleaning. Tabletops and seats were greasy, with scattered crumbs, used, crumpled-up napkins, and trash receptacles spilling over with garbage piled high into a pyramid or leaning tower of trash just waiting to fall over onto the floor or some unsuspecting customer walking by. And NOT ONE Manager seemed to notice or to care. Makes me wonder how they are preparing my food, if they care so little about how they present and deliver the rest of the place? Already Ghetto-Fabulous. Within a month of opening. Had to be at least 12 crew members who had little more to do than engage the others in raucous behavior and standing around, getting in the way while 1 or 2 Crew Members seemed to do it all while the others watched. Outrageously poor management system here!"}
{"text":"this is a newer location...which would seem so amazing and fresh, but no...the guy at the window was being sarcastic and laughed at my car, their dark so machine wasn't working so I was limited to Fanta, or sprite. the macaroni & cheese was def. over cooked, had a burnt after taste, not even  a hint of yellow to it, not sure why but it was a pale white color. the girl who gave me the food at the window didn't even say bye or have a nice day. she just stared, and I had to ask for condiments which should also be offered. I guess I expected more. I like popeyes but this experience shows me otherwise. Always room for improvement, get it together popeyes."}
{"text":"Went there today. They were out of chicken wings, said they don't sale macaroni and cheese on this side, no corn and no green beans... Ridiculous !!"}
{"text":"I prefer this location than the one located near where i live , mostly because the bus goes by there. Great food , great prices."}
{"text":"Great food , this location is inside of a shell station (Circle K products). The popeyes employees don't care if you get a drink from the Circle K side (as long as you order chicken , duh). Great for lunch or dinner. And on tuesdays they have the $1 special."}
{"text":"So we found a dying culture ... amazing customer service !! Have not even tasted the food we purchased, but that was by far the most friendliest, knowledgeable staff that I have encountered in a long time. Will a absolutely be back ! Great job Popeyes !!"}
{"text":"Their chicken is delicious.  A little pricey unless you catch a special."}
{"text":"For fast food fried chicken this Popeye's is great. It's brand new. The food come out quick and steaming hot. Not greasy at all."}
{"text":"This is one of two close Popeyes to me. I have to say that staff is usually nice, and service is quick. Though o find that this location is usually busy, especially close to lunch time as it is situated near a high school. This location offers minimal seating, and has washrooms."}
{"text":"First of all, fried chicken is life. When I found out that there was Popeyes 10 mins from my house I lost it.. lol 

Came in for dinner around 7:30pm. It was pretty quiet for a typical dinner time. Overall, Clean restaurant and friendly cashier. What really ruined it for me was not the food or the service but the manager working at the time. So didn't really greet any of the customers and had a mean look the whole time just mad dogging you for no reason. I was a bit taken back from it. Hope you don't treat other customers the same way. Also both of the restrooms were out of order which made it very inconvenient. 

Chicken was great tho...I got two drumsticks and two thighs. FYI You get them buttermilk biscuits with your chicken. They gave me like 4 lol Ya, it was amazing. Make sure to get the spicy for the flavor not the mild. The mild flavor just taste plain, you don't get that Cajun kick with it"}
{"text":"Not busy but dirty tables at noon....but they opened at 11?? Service was okay nothing special at all. But the wings were great. Need to work on customer service and SMILE!"}
{"text":"I've been there 2 times the past 5 years and now I remember why I never returned.  I decided to get dinner there one night for my family and went through the drive thru.  \"Yeah,\" was how I was greeted both times.  I'm sorry but at a place of business, \"yeah,\" is very rude and unprofessional.  Just how I was greeted both times was the reason I didn't return.  Food isn't so bad but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call myself a regular but I've been here a few times lately bc of timing... the first time was a good experience, it was a very fast drive thru getting a decent amount of chicken, I want to say 10 pieces? But it was good, quick, hot chicken, but the fries were soggy within the 5 minutes of driving home. They seem like they were sitting for quite awhile and were the last of a not fresh serving. 
Second time was also drive thru, but I had missing items (order of fries & biscuits) and wasn't as close to home by the time I realized stuff was missing, I didn't care to call or return bc of how much of a hassle it would've been for me to get back. 
Third time around was better, I ordered the $4 meal thing (which I was calling mystery meat ) bc it was cheap and also had a coupon for some tenders. I didn't feel well after eating that $4 meal so I don't plan on getting that again. There just seems to be inconsistencies within this place that no matter when I'll go, something will always end up wrong or not tasting right."}
{"text":"Very very very good. I was pleasantly surprised since it was at a mall. Food was fresh and tasty. The staff was very kind and helpful in directing me on what to order."}
{"text":"I see all of these bad reviews and I have to disagree. I've been here a few times and haven't had any problems. Granted the food takes a little long, but it's right out the fryer when I get it. 

Customer service is very good and friendly. The manager and staff hustling the whole time, while maintaining a respectable manner. 

My food is always delicious. The fish and popcorn shrimp combo with mashed potatoes is always served straight from the fryer. Mmmmm and the apple pie good too."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. If your main focus is chicken you would think chicken would be available.  Was told the car in front of me had a 5 minute wait BEFORE I even received a greeting. Placed my order then was told it would be 15 minutes because there were no wings. On top of the 5 minute wait for the car ahead of me....

Seriously? It can't be that difficult..."}
{"text":"I'll be honest. I usually review things on the same scale. Popeyes has a special place in my heart and I love it, so it gets an extra star for that. Even though it's fast food, it's delicious. The spicy seasoning and buttery biscuits are great. Service is horrendously slow here though :("}
{"text":"Last Saturday, I decided to give Popeyes a try. This location is the closest to my work. I was doing a staycation and it was the closest one to where I was staying.

Although this parking lot gets busy, there is plenty of parking. This location has been around for roughly a year.

I walked in and ordered the Sunday special, which is five spicy wings that go for $5.29. The woman at the counter kept confirming my order with a questionable intonation in her voice. After about three exchanges and seeing her co-working come help her out, I realized that she was learning the ropes.

I was waiting for order 76 to be called. I stood there by the drink area. There isn't a ton of room to stand there, unless you want to move over to sit down and wait.

The new woman came over and wanted to get water from the fountain drink area. She didn't know how to. I was helping her out. It turns out that there is a tiny knob in front of the ice where you can get straight water. We both learned a lot. I told her that she was doing fine, which seemed to put her at ease.

I was advised that my wait time for the wings was eight minutes. The woman made sure that the guy deep-frying them was on course. Cool.

I got my order. I thanked her and she smiled back.

I went back to my hotel to eat. I had pop and some other food that would accompany the wings nicely. The wings were so good. I loved the kick. The crispiness was perfect and the wings were meaty.

I am still in my fried chicken phase. I am sure that I'll be back to try some more items.

{"text":"I go through phases when it comes to food. For years, I didn't crave fried chicken. Since we flipped over to 2018, I have been on a quest for decent fried chicken.

I frequent the closest Starbucks by my home often. I am such a regular that I might as well live there. This Popeyes is two businesses down from it. Surprisingly, it is my first time going to this Popeyes.

Yesterday, I left work early to come home and continue working. I needed lunch. I decided to pick up some food at Popeyes. I had arrived at around 13:00. I had no issues finding a parking spot. I parked and walked in.

You see the daily specials before you even open the door. I got the Tuesday special, which is two pieces of chicken. I also made it a combo, which add an extra $1.29 to your order, and gets you fries and a drink. Not shabby at all!

The woman helping me out with my order was friendly. Perhaps she knew that I was a novice at ordering anything here. I got my chicken mild. Perhaps next time, I will be daring and order spicy.

I paid with debit. The store also accepts credit cards and cash.

I got my receipt. She didn't tell me that there is a number on it. I wasn't paying attention to the number being called. I figured it out after getting my diet beverage filled.

Service was fast. I was impressed. Coincidentally, one of my regular baristas at Starbucks was placing an order next to me.

There was plenty of seating in the eatery. It looked clean. Even the drink area was clean, with a small receptacle to throw the wrapper off your drink straw.

I drove home and chowed down. I was impressed at how large the pieces of chicken were. If you were at KFC, you would need help locating them. One chicken piece here was so large that it hid the huge drumstick underneath! The chicken was tasty. It wasn't greasy. It was tender, juicy, and perfect.

The fries had a Cajun kick to it. I saw specks of black pepper, too. I normally don't like fries, but these were decent. My drink helped down everything.

If you are on a budget and want decent food that fills you up, the daily specials are for you. I will come back to try some more.

{"text":"I've gone here before love the food but the costumer service is totally horrible. I was at the drive thru placing my order after each time I said I wanted something the employee working the window constantly repeated \"anything else\" I told him yes proceeded to order and he asked again. I still wasn't done ordering. It was as though he was rushing me and I did feel very rushed. I pulled up to the window and there he was still rushing. I gave half cash and half card. I told him I have cash I want to give you and what ever is left place on the card. Tell me why he ran my card twice for both amounts. So at this point I'm pissed off. I asked for the manager she said that she could refund it back to my card and just recharge me. I said no give me my cash back and I'll take the food. So she took my card back and refunded me the money never once told me she was going to when I told her that it was okay to leave it alone. Here I am sitting in the drive thru waiting for food and she comes back and says \"Did you still want the food?\" Ugh no I'm just sitting here waiting for nothing yes I wanted to the food at that point I was super pissed off and left ! Never once did she apologize to me for his actions and never once did she apologize to me for waiting for nothing. I asked for his, her and her managers name I told her I would be calling him very next day and her response was OKAY BYE. Yeah worst service if ever have. I understand it's in a ghetto location and the staff probably doesn't even have a high school diploma and apparently don't have listening skills either but dam. Will never visit again!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I very rarely rate a restaurant poorly, and usually always give employees/food/building conditions etc. the benefit of the doubt. I also try not to write a negative review until after I've gone there 3+ times. 

This Popeyes is pretty bad. I've gone at least three times, and almost every time I've had some small issue, whether it be a long wait, messed up order, incorrect/not enough sauces, and then after my last visit, awful employees.

Long story short, this last time, a friend and I went in about 1 1/2 hours before close. I ordered a 3 piece traditional combo, and my friend ordered a 5 piece tenders combo. After about 15 minutes of waiting in the store, I got my food. While waiting another 10 minutes for my friends, I decided to check my food (based on them getting many things wrong in the past). Lo and behold, one of my pieces is missing. I made a relatively serious joke to my friend saying, \"I wouldn't be surprised if they did that on purpose, especially for how often things go wrong here.\" He laughs and we continue to wait. Now his food is finally ready, and as he goes to the counter, the two employees are putting his tenders in the box, and he overhears one of the employees say to the other, \"only put 4 tenders in.\" Remember, he ordered a 5 piece. So he looks in his box and only sees four, so he assertively tells them instantly and asks for his 5th piece. Which the scandalous employee kind of shutters and gives him an extra (he luckily ended up with 6, I wish I got an extra ). I didn't hear the exchange but when we got in the car he tells me all of this. 

We get home and I sit down, and guess what? They gave me the wrong sauces! 
Long wait, relatively poor customer service, purposely trying to give us less food than we paid for (they also over charge the crap out of getting an extra breast or thigh), and wrong sauces. It's mind blowing how hard it is for them to give correct sauces hahaha. 

The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of one, is that Popeyes is amazing and the food has always been good when I go to this location. I will be back, but I will make sure not to go through the drive thru (they mess up 100% of the time in the drive thru), and I will meticulously check my entire order before I leave. And the reason I'm writing the review is so that you do the same, and don't let this poorly run restaurant screw your over as well. 

Au revoir!"}
{"text":"This is in reference to the Casa Grande Popeyes, I went there to order their $5.00 box which I had ordered in the past when it was offered, it's either two piece chicken dinner or three piece chicken tenders, I ordered the two piece dinner when I got home and opened the box I asked my wife why they had switched to Cornish game hens as that was the size of the two pieces of chicken resembled. So I can't speak for the other locations only the Casa Grande, stay away from there and this special."}
{"text":"So had a taste for some spicey chicken 
Well after waiting 45 minutes I still didn't get my chicken . Seemed like a lot of upset people there that night. Then I ordered a couple of pies and after 10 minutes of waiting they told us that they had ran out ? 
Seriously"}
{"text":"The food was good.  I had the boneless tenders three piece, with the cajun fries.  The chicken was crispy, the fries were hot (we asked for fresh fries).  The service was deplorable. The girl who waited on us could not care less about this job or customer service.  I overheard the manager tell one of the employees to \"go ahead and feed his boys.\" I don't know if these were literally his kids, or just some friends. They looked like his kids (he was an adult, these were teens). The kids were thrilled to get the food (which I believe was free). The kids cleaned the tables, took out the trash, and swept the dining room after eating.  I have managed many restaurants, and I know employees will steal you blind, so I always supported \"breaking the rules\" and allowing employees to eat for free or give out free food to family if I knew about it.  I would rather know what's going on and have some control over it then have wholesale theft happening, so I applaud the manager for this.  The store was very clean.  The only thing that was bad at this location was the service."}
{"text":"I recently got popeyes delivery through uber. The delivery time was quick, took about 20mins which was reasonable. 
The food however, wasn't so great. I've had Popeye's chicken a couples years back (its been a while) and I remember it being way better than all the other chicken places. 
I got the Cajun chicken sandwich combo with 2 sides and a drink. I chose the Cajun fries and coleslaw. The chicken sandwich itself was spicy (I can handle spice but it was overly spicy to the point where you can't taste the chicken). The fries were okay, wasn't as crispy and was plain but I can't complain much because I got delivery. The coleslaw didn't taste like coleslaw. It was super stale.

I don't think I would be getting food at this location anymore. In my opinion, it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"I love this Popeye's. The workers are always happy and their chicken is always fresh along with their biscuits. My only complaint with this location is the placement of the sidewalk that crosses the drive through. Whoever designed this didn't like pedestrian traffic coming from the large park across the street. 

Back to the food. Fresh, hot and spicy chicken just the way I like it. Last night I even had a hot fresh biscuit. Those are always the best. I've never had a bad meal nor have I had to wait very long for my food. Husband had the popcorn shrimp and the very horseradishy cocktail sauce. The coleslaw was a bit bland but the well seasoned mashed potatoes and perfect fried chicken made up for it."}
{"text":"Sad experience.  Went to the drive in at 10pm and was told they could not fill an order of their 10 for $10.99.  They only had 3 pieces of chicken.  That's not enough to feed both people in the car so we just left.  The employee made it pretty clear he wouldn't make more."}
{"text":"Chicken from hell.  Oh my god.

I am 45 years old and I have never seen some incompetence and ignorance in my life.  I waited 20 minutes for a shrimp platter and a 4 piece fried chicken platter.  There was another couple who ordered BEFORE us who didn't get their food until over 40 minutes after they ordered.  You can KNIT a bloody chicken faster than that.

I specified a sauce substitute that was clearly notated on the receipt.  They screwed it up.  I went back to the counter to get it switched.  The \"manager\" in the blue shirt walked around for 4-5 minutes and completely ignored me conveying the attitude that he was the \"expediter\" (what a laugh) and that he didn't deal with customers.  The girl on the cash had her back to me the whole time despite the fact I was trying to subtly tap on the counter to get her attention.  The couple who waited 40 minutes for the chicken loudly admonished me to YELL at them.  I went back to my table and decided to just eat the shrimp dry because they were getting cold.  My wife took the sauce and made a second attempt.  An attempt to get PLAIN TARTAR SAUCE.  It's on the menu board.  But apparently it's not available.  She ended up getting me ranch.  I would have been happy with cobra venom after the time I waited for a bloody 5 cent package of sauce.

And the best part was... I was within earshot of the counter for the entire duration of my visit and i didn't hear a single word of apology to anyone.  The ATTITUDE on the staff was contemptible, rude, and arrogant.  One guy who waited 20 minutes for chicken voiced his concerns about the wait time when he picked up his food.  The girl at the counter stared at him like he'd offended her mother and then TURNED HER BACK TO HIM without a single word of apology.

Another lady, seeing the lineup of people around the counter waiting for food asked her \"What's the wait time for chicken.  And I mean the REAL wait time.  Not the bull---- wait times you've been telling these people...\"

I would like to personally fire the people who were working at the location I visited tonight.  Otherwise, I don't intend to visit it ever again.  People who don't know how to do simple service should not work in the restaurant industry.  PERIOD."}
{"text":"I've gone there a couple of times, and it was fine. This last time I went, it was all ran by kids. It took them about 10 min to take our order, we stood there while the kids were mopping, and they kept on going towards the back. The line was getting longer.  I had asked for the tenders combo, and I got bone one chicken."}
{"text":"Eh. Went through drive thru and ordered. Employee repeated order back and it was correct so didn't check bag. Also didn't check reviews on Yelp first either, lol, that would've helped. I was missing my fries with my combo. It is what it is. I wouldn't think anything of it bc shit happens but it looks like this location has that happen often based on other reviews/comments. Was disappointed bc it was my first time eating at a Popeyes. Besides the missing side item the biscuits seemed a tad on the salty side. Like the top was just coated in a layer of salt."}
{"text":"Dumb, dumb, dumb as rocks here. Ordered a combo and it ended up in 3 different bags separate with another meal, wasn't spicy like ordered either. Then tried to order a single item off the kids menu which I know they can do but they insisted that item didn't exist as a meal OR item and I'm staring right at it. Ordered a side, didn't get that in my bag either, also ordered a drink and they neglected to tell me they removed it from the order but we still ended up with a kids meal bag? I have no idea... We even said we'd wait and we did wait a few minutes, I'm fine with that but don't tell me you don't have items I can see,  convince me to get something else and then not even give it to me properly."}
{"text":"the best staff ever. the manager mariah made sure i got everything i needed. the chicken and sides are great. sooooo happy to finally have one in this area."}
{"text":"It's hard for me to find a reason not to like Popeyes chicken. I'm all about the batter, hot chicken, & the buttermilk biscuits!!! I was a little disappointed in the size of the wings but the staff recognized I got the 'short side of wings' and made sure to take care of me without me even saying a word!! That's why they 5 stars... The customer service at this location is great and the staff is always double checking the orders when they hand off! 

I know, it's a chain restaurant, but that means you expect them to be consistent... And they have been with good customer service."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff that will give you a good deal if you ask for one. Chicken is great. Don't bother with the poutine."}
{"text":"Good place for a Popeyes. 

Staff was okay but nothing special. Location was clean. Good was very well done and they seemed to give generous portions."}
{"text":"Good.... if you have a low quality standard for your food you eat. Food was done within seconds of ordering.... nothing was \"hot\" it was just \"food lamp warm.\" My onion rings were soggy. I didn't see any workers using gloves. I saw an associate pick up trash then continue to package meals up front without washing hands... gross. If you want good food wait for a Culver's ."}
{"text":"Very slow. Also they're always out of certain items, 3/4 of the time I come here they're out of fries!!! Disappointing because the food is good."}
{"text":"Eternal wait times, poorly trained or apathetic employees. Orders consistently  incorrect. I've visited this location several times and they're not improving."}
{"text":"Food is great. Employees needs training especially that little girl on the drive thru intercom. Don't fckng talk to people in the intercom and leave them hanging cos you are too busy on your phone. These people have no phone etiquette. So rude and unprofessional. And when I finally drove up to the window... little girl was walking around while talking to the drive thru customers on her microphone the way she was rudely talking to me. So irritated of that lil itch.

Anyways I gave the food a 3 but the employees a 0. So I put 1 to make it fair.... actually I couldn't put NO STARS that's why!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a 2pc combo and he punched in 3. This is the only Popeye's I've seen that does not allow substitutions for side and drink. Well, he'd give both if I buy them separately (gravy and water). Really?!"}
{"text":"Horrible Service Always Running Out Of Chicken In middle of day there no straws for drinks no spoons it's just horrible for customers"}
{"text":"Ok, this place is good, but not the best. Tried the number 7 meal, the 5 piece chicken tenders, and I really felt like the chicken was raw. I did get the spicy one. It was a bit hard, definably not as soft as Bojangles tender chicken pieces. 

I might come back to try the shrimp, and the fish, but I think the chicken is out of the question for me."}
{"text":"Slow Drive Through. It's about 11:00 PM and I had 1 car in front of me. I waited about 15 minutes before I got to the window. I don't know if it was the customer or restaurant, but considering I was just getting 5 piece chicken tenders and fries, that was long.

The chicken tenders were as I expected.
The fries were stale like they've been sitting around for several hours, but the seasoning was good."}
{"text":"Three stars for the weak service at this Popeyes location. I've been there a handful of times and found them out of spicy chicken on one occasion, out of red beans & rice on another. And these weren't busy or overcrowded days. These are the company's most popular dishes, how can a location be so poorly stocked that they run out of them?

Then there was the visit that they ran out of cooked chicken and locked the door until more was made. Seriously. It gave one of the employees some extra time to count biscuits as she made them. Watching her do this, it was apparent she was having trouble with it.

If you have a choice, find another Popeyes location. I no longer frequent this one at all."}
{"text":"OK I don't know what that food was. I spent 15$, I got two combos, and threw it all away. It was so bad I didn't want my money back. This is my 4x in a row getting stale fries or old chicken. I use to try to eat a biscuit as a snack but after my last visit I think I'll stay away. By the way, the employees were kind.
That's bad though, because Popeye's use to rock! Farewell Popeye's!"}
{"text":"They keep the chicken fresh and cooking. 

The staff are prompt. The place is clean. This location is a little small. There is not ample seating.

Friday and Saturday nights by 7pm forward gets busy with impatient rude angry black people so its better to go before if you dont wanna get annoyed with those personalities."}
{"text":"Okay went here again tonight and just rude rude rude people working up front. Also they where mopping the floors and cooking at the same time... the floors where just drenched in water like a huge mess where everyone was still standing and working and cooking food. I got mashed potatoes and then then my friend goes to place her order and they say they are out of mashed potatoes. And then I ask if I am getting the old ones...? She says no, but when I get home- they taste very very salty and sort of dry. They never want to give you more than one sauce and if you don't ask for any, they won't ask you if you want any- you get 0.
Nobody was paying any attention it seems like a bunch of young people hanging out and not even caring at all about their jobs. They need to fire everyone there... it was a mess tonight. I will NOT be going back ever again."}
{"text":"So you guys sell just pieces of chicken without combos but when it comes to Shrimp no one knows what to do? The cashier was so confused. I was in the drive thru and asked for just a box of shrimp. No combo, no sides, just shrimp. She was so lost like she never heard it before. Kept questioning me. Then asks what side would I like. Again, I said no sides. She said she would have a price for me at the window. I get to the window and she says \"Did you have the 10 piece combo?\" I said no... the one that just wanted Shrimp... Again, confused look. She grabs a manager and he gives me a price. He didn't hesitate. 

I am now sitting in the parking lot because the shrimp was going to take 2 minutes to cook. I've been sitting for 5 minutes now. They probably don't even remember what car I'm in... 

The manager felt bad about me waiting so long and he gave me two orders of shrimp. That was kind of him. 

Gotta train those front line employees correctly. I have much respect for that manager. He was working hard and smart. He made my trip to this location better."}
{"text":"Why do I do this to myself? I seriously should have just went and got some bubble tea. But no, I get off the 61 and I see Popeyes right there and I know that they have those \"cool\" coke machines. I was like, \"girl, get yourself some flavored fuzzy water, do it, you deserve it.\" 

I go in and was talking to the cashier about the green beans. Yeah, I know who starts a green bean conversation? The cashier said to me, \"I don't know, I don't eat vegetables.\" YOU DON'T EAT VEGETABLES?? (Again nothing to do with the actual food) How is it that a person can not eat a single vegetable in there adult life? Is that not concerning?

Anyways, back to the food. So I get my cup for water. I get to the awesome pop machine. I go and push, \"Dasani sparkling\". OH WAIT. THEY DON'T HAVE ANY FLAVORS OTHER THAN LIME. Seriously??? Qdoba down the street has all kinds of Dasani flavors and Popeyes has only one??? This is bull..... I just went and got plain. I mean I really like just regular unflavored sparkling water. But I was looking for something different. Sigh... Next time, bubble tea for sure."}
{"text":"I wish I could give his place more stars bc the chicken is actually pretty good IMO. But the service is horrible. Absolutely horrible. I don't know if it's bc of horrible training or horrible management but the customer service here is severely lacking. 

Waiting more than 10 minutes in the drive-thru is ridiculous. Ordering spicy and coming home and finding it to be not spicy is ridiculous. No napkins are ever in the bag. 

Placing your order in the drive thru is a whole other story. Be prepared to be cut off mid order by the cashier. Be prepared to have to repeat your order at least twice. 

Sadly this is the closest location to my home so I will be back...

Update: just got home and I asked 3 times for spicy 2 piece thigh and a leg....and it's 2 pieces of white. Smh"}
{"text":"Ask me a year ago to rate this place and I would give it 4 stars. But presently it's just a disappointing place. 

It's located on windmill and las vegas blvd, connected to a gas station. Interior is pretty small, you're better off ordering to go and eating at home. Sometimes the place gets really smelly.

Just your usual fast food place, order at the window and wait for them to call out your number. If you do a walk in on a tuesday you're going to end up waiting 45 minutes for some chicken -___-.  Waiting for your food is a game here, sometimes it comes out immediately and sometimes you wait forever.

As for the taste you don't come here because it's the best chicken in the world. You come here because its average and its cheap. Nothing much to say.
 
What annoys me are their prices! :( They keep raising them wtf! The sauces use to be free now they charge you for it. Also their $.50 tuesday special is no longer $.50 it's like $.80 or something. IT'S CALLED TUESDAY SPECIAL FOR A REASON.


PRO TIP! Go through the drive-thru when ordering much much more faster."}
{"text":"I've only been there once, when I was like 5. So do not recommend... ITS NASTY... it was not good and I did not like. This was a big disappointment to me and my family because I had just come from a soccer game and was hungry. We came and I almost threw up!"}
{"text":"Hot spicy crispy chicken pieces with Louisiana hot sauce. Mashed potatoes with spicy gravy. Red beans with rice.  Shrimp po'boys. Spicy fries. Warm biscuits. These are a few of my favourite things. Keep it coming, Popeye's Chicken!"}
{"text":"Order was prepared quickly and accurately and tasted fine. Could have used more dipping sauce. Fast food in Las Vegas. It is what it is."}
{"text":"This location has the worst customer service that you can ever imagine.  Manager insulted and disrespected my family members for no reason whatsoever.  Upper management should get involved in order to fix this and not have it affect current and future business.

I will never eat at this Popeyes ever again after that horrible experience."}
{"text":"This Popeyes is a stupid outlet i have ever visited. Ladies working ain't decent. Drive through is a crazy thing & needs a lot of sound improvements. One doesn't understands what the person is saying from inside the kitchen. Orders missed by the drive-through lady..
Crazy & horrible !

Please you need to be more professional & helping as well as you should listen properly to the customers & not mess with their orders."}
{"text":"On the 23rd of OCT- Went to get a \"meal\" and requested strips and made my order large. Only to get to my destination to find it was not large and the strips were practically all batter. Just pure crap. I reach out to the \"customer service side\" and sent an email explaining the issue & requesting some form of compensation and/or a refund of my money. Apparently, which is email is then forwarded to the locations \"management\" email address (which was not a Popeye's official email at all...) & the owner/manager/whomever it was that responded... of course they hit me with the scripted spew of \"making it right.\" 

Yeah ok, but the dilemma is I am not about to drive 23 miles for a $9 meal. 

So after responding and informing them of that distance issue and requesting that a gift card or something be mailed to compensate; I was told by whomever responds to the emails- because there was no professionalism involved- no name- no nothing given... I asked deliberately \"are you telling me that I need to drive 23 miles to get my refund?\" - Til this day NO response.  So I emailed corporate again and have yet to get a response. 

Unprofessional & crappy problem resolution- no wonder this place has a ton of negative reviews. So since I clearly cannot get a proper refund or my money back here is a review that can help ya'll assess the problem with your location, but your rating explains a lot of that. You just don't care.

You were given an opportunity to \"make it right\" but you did the exact opposite. Therefore, it's only right- and my DUTY to let anyone else know to stay the hell away from this location. Here's your $9.00 &  23 mile review since you refuse to respond to an official problem a customer has professionally. Fair exchange- no robbery."}
{"text":"Everything sucks about this place. Go out of your way to avoid eating here. Orders were all screwed up. Took forever to get out food. Servers didn't know what they were doing."}
{"text":"I guess I'll review it too. It's been a few months since we last got takeout from Popeye's, and for the most part, I recall being unimpressed.

Chicken-wise, Popeye's is three steps ahead of KFC's, but their sides are dismal. \"Bonafide\" my left big toe. We tried them all, and each one of them was essentially flavorless.

Oh, and for fast food, they sure were pricey! 

And we were so excited about having this franchise come here too.

Try Frisch's in Caste Village for quality fried chicken."}
{"text":"Awesome service! I called in a large order and they immediately said we can do this for you, unlike the Jones & Sahara location. 
This location is further from my company, unlike the other location that blew me off which is 2 blocks away."}
{"text":"If the owner of this location cares about his franchise he better listen to his Yelp reviews. 
I called at 10am requesting to order 40 Cajun surf & Turf's and to pick them up at 11:15am. 
The manager kind of laughed and said he can't do that and I should have called in the day before. 
I hung up and called the location on Decatur and Flamingo and the lady who answered said she could absolutely get that done for me. 
SOMETHING IS WRONG AT THIS LOCATION!"}
{"text":"Two things really bother me greed and opportunists,Popeyes to a tee. 16 oz side dish divided by 4 adults equals 4 oz of food each, excuse me did I stumble into Ethiopia by mistake.? I cant speak for you but eating satisfies another need besides nourishing my body...I like to do it ...hello. Would have a hard time doing so with just 4 oz of a side dish. Nothing new under the sun , all fast food placed are stingy with the sides. My coleslaw taste better by far anyway, plus I can make it in minutes, I means 3 minutes slaw mix $1.59., add mayo $.50, couple capfuls of vinegar $.10, add raisins sliced apple. Temper the ingredients to how you like it, I do this most of the time because its a bummer running out of slaw before chicken and potatoes. Please don't fault me this is your all's world I'm just trying to live in it, however it aint Popeye's world so remember that when you go in there. Make them do you right."}
{"text":"The crew and management here are about as useful as a ham sandwich at a Bar Mitzvah... 

Went here yesterday. Ordered a 16 piece to go (from inside the store) and was told it would be at least 15 minutes... No biggie... We go out to the car and wait the 15 minutes. We would have stayed in the restaurant and drank our drinks, but honestly, I just can't handle the constant yelling, cussing, and other BS that the crew here gets away with. So, we come back in the store 10 minutes later (remember, they said 15) and I asked if the food was read... I was informed that they gave our order to someone else who came in and ordered, because they didn't see us and assumed we left! 

Assumed we left? THEY TOLD US it would be 15 minutes, we came back in 10! The nasty ass hood rat behind the counter couldn't stop clicking her teeth long enough to even explain herself. She was a disrespectful c*nt. 

Do people typically come in and order food just to leave without picking it up? 

We finally got our food.... we asked for mashed potatoes with no gravy, we got mashed potatoes with gravy on them, and gravy on the side. We asked for regular, we got spicy. They said that they would \"hook us up with more chicken\" and when we got home, I counted 15 pieces! ONE LESS! 

Bottom line... 

Employee's suck and can't count
Orders are wrong almost always
Management, well their building a rat ship full of seagoing suckas
Food - average at best, dried out and nasty at worse
The store smells like the inside of a rats anus, and I'm pretty sure it's NEVER been mopped. 

Definitely stop in and get yourself a 2 piece, if you're interested in vomiting later in the evening."}
{"text":"Terrible service today. Went through the drive thru and order ended up being completely wrong. I had to remind the girl working the window that I had a drink and then had to drive all the way back to pick up the Po'boy I ordered and paid for because it didn't make it in the bag apparently. Then when I got home, the chicken strips I ordered for my kids were not mild, but spicy, so they couldn't eat them. Total waste."}
{"text":"Clean and uncrowded. Super fast service and well priced. The atmosphere is really nice for fast food and the food is spectacular. I got the 3 piece combo and they gave me all white meat and it's such a good spice. This is definitely for people who can't stand crowds."}
{"text":"My previous review of this place was 1 star, and if I could, it would be 0 stars. After sitting in the lobby for 14 minutes...14 damn minutes, I get told that they are out of white meat. How does this happen?? It's a chicken place. They primarily sell chicken. They should never run out of chicken!!! Then I'm told if I want to wait for white meat, it will be 13 more minutes. So, 27 minutes I have to wait. I understand it takes time to get the chicken to a safe temperature, that's not the issue. Time management is the damn issue here. Get your crap together damn it."}
{"text":"Overcooked chicken and dry could be nuggets and man the places is nice and fancy with the decor. Restrooms were dirty and layout of the drink machine and the teas-were sticky! Its been a couple times Ive came and there wasn't any HOT SAUCE !! Whats the point of eating chicken without HOT SAUCE!! The best thing was the tea and the biscuits!! Gave this place so many tries but g-dame its the same thing or worse.. anybody thats goes thru drive thru better make sure you have everything! Or at least give me some napkins"}
{"text":"Have never had such bad chicken ever. Went through drive around 5pm. Taking the order didn't seem bad. It was quick and they even repeated my order. When I received my 8 piece dark they were serious about it being dark! It seemed as if they recooked it a few times because it was old and cold. It had looked AND tasted as if it had been left from yesterday and they needed to refry and serve it. When it came to the 5 piece tender combo I ordered, I got 3.5 pieces. That being 3 were full pieces, looked to be broken in half and I was just plain missing the 5th piece. And my side of fries ended up being mashed potatoes I didn't order more want! When I called 6x back to back to try and speak with a manager, the phone just rang. Poor service, poor delivery, and definitely not worth the price I paid!"}
{"text":"Not sure how the other locations are but we had this one first charge us for the wrong order and then give us the wrong change back twice. Being our first time here it was pretty annoying! Popcorn shrimp wasn't the best but it was good but the chicken was really disappointing and basically fried to a crisp with no chicken."}
{"text":"I like Popeye's normally, but we were eating lunch there about 6 months ago and there was a employee sweeping the floors... then the tables.

Yeah Sweeping the tables.. with the same broom.

First he was doing it backwards. He should of swept the table then the floor... so he wouldn't need to resweep the floor.

Second WHY ARE YOU SWEEPING THE TABLES WITH THE FLOOR BROOM!!!

We have not been back."}
{"text":"Over staffed but always not enough chicken. Yikes! I went here twice, the first time they only have thighs left and no drumstick. Oh okay it happens. Next time same thing... Oh well it's next to my house it'll do for fam dinner no cooking needed from me. Worst part we all got the poops after eating the chicken. Scary! So 1 star for the nice newly built building. :)"}
{"text":"Recently are here and while the food was your typical fried chicken, I was somewhat surprised at how spicy everything is. Even the mashed potatoes had a kick. Just be cautious if you don't like spicy food."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town.. And this POPEYES is the BEST Popeyes by far the best one I have ever been to across the country. They have fast friendly service and greet all guests as they enter the establishment. However my food wasn't the best.. The customer service alone was a good enough reason for me to return to give them another try... The employees love their customers.. And I am sure if I brought the issue to their attention they would have dealt with it accordingly. They have that kind of vibe. I was really in a rush and didn't have time plus they were really busy.. Thank you for the hard work and dedication to your customers.."}
{"text":"I have been going to popeye's since I was in college 35 years ago in New Orleans.  The have been improving things ever since. They are not known for extremely fast service. But who cares when the food is consistently good. One thing I will say is that their employees really do care and are trying as hard as they can. So lighten up people and enjoy some spicy chicken and red beans and rice."}
{"text":"Great comfort food, always greeted warmly as soon as I walk in. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Definitely better food and service than KFC. I love that their food actually has a little kick to it!

My only complaint is that it gets pretty busy and sometimes they don't clean the tables as fast as they need to."}
{"text":"Sometimes slow on service but always fast on flavour and great taste!

Why oh why would one ever buy a mcchicken when you can get REAL chicken meat with a sandwich from here?? 

Also there newer menu has a lot of new options like butterfly and popcorn shrimp, creole flavoured sandwich, Cajun surf and turf.

To be completely transparent on my review I am referencing the Brock and Taunton location where the service and wait time is MUCH BETTER than the Dundas and thickson location. As one reviewer previously noted the service is garbage at that location.  Drive the extra 2 miles and come to Taunton and Brock."}
{"text":"You know, I used to believe that rating fast food places on Yelp was a complete waste of time.  I mean, it's fast food so it's never going to be a great experience, but it is what it is so what's the point?  Well....  I found myself in Las Vegas this weekend and I just wanted to get away from the Bellagio for a bit so I used Google Maps to find a fairly distant Popeye's and decided to go for that.  It's connected to a gas station, which isn't really a negative, but for some reason, I always feel that gas station-attached restaurants are always somewhat inferior.  In theory, it should be a feature, but for some reason, it just never is.

First off, there was a homeless guy sleeping inside the place which I guess was ok.  But, then I noticed that the soda machine was completely out of almost everything.  Other visitors commented about this and the reaction was just \"Oh ok\".  Clearly they knew but didn't care to do anything about it.  Also, from peering into the kitchen, the work areas were just filthy.  There was stuff strewn all over the floor and messy containers laid out in the open.  When I got my food, they even got my order wrong so I didn't eat the side plus somehow the chicken seemed scrawnier than usual.   That seemed odd to me because isn't this stuff all standardized and shipped from a centralized distributor?

It actually pains me to write this because to be honest, the staff was REALLY nice.   They were clearly doing their best and they tried hard to be friendly, courteous and helpful but this place is just no."}
{"text":"VEHEMENT is putting it mildly!!! I went thru the drive thru of this Popeye's while  on my lunch break on 4/17/2012. I started watching my calories for health reasons. I must say the lady @ the window assisted me, as she took my order with excellent customer service. So I decided to go back today 4/18/2012 and order the chicken wrap as I did yesterday. It is only a $1.61 nothing at all to pay, when I usually spend over 5 bucks a day for lunch.

 But like I stated, I was watching my calories. I pulled in approached the speaker and asked  to order a chicken wrap WITH OUT the WRAP ( a heavy, large, flour,  tortilla) Which makes up most of the chicken wrap, in addition to the calories. Immediately with out any thought the woman-behind the speaker said \"No! We can't do that) this was @ 12:30 noon Ironically there were no cars behind me. That should have been a red flag to me. But I was hungry and apparently oblivious too. So I said I would pull forward to the window. 

As I approached the window I repeated the order and the woman said \"I told you NO we can't do that\". My reply was: What do you mean you can do that?  
She says in her very broken English, You have to buy the chicken strip separately and it will cost you more. @ that point I requested to speak with a member of management. 

She rolled her eyes telling me I am the manager. SMH because I'm hungry, my lunch is just about over. I didn't believe Melissa, because the badge she  was wearing did not indicate manager, and her appearance defiantly  was not that of a manager over seeing an eatery.   
 So I became upset at this point. I asked her what was the problem? mentioning that my request was not rocket science. I didn't want anything free. All I wanted was my chicken strip and tablespoon of red beans and rice that come in side of the wrap.

No more no less. 
She asked me how is she to prepare that. With tears in my eyes, because I was starving and my time was limited. I said... Look lady, how difficult is it to place a chicken strip and a tablespoon of red beans and rice on the the paper you wrap the wrap in. She says:\" well it's gonna  take four minutes to cook, because you dunt tell me if you want the chicken spicy or mild\". Then she request that I park off to the side of restaurant as the chicken cooks. And some one will bring it out,Because customers were behind me.

 I asked her what the hell am I?  and I refused to move until she gave me my order. Amazingly  the chicken strip appeared before my eyes. But the saddest part about it, was after all of the drama ,I returned to work late and hungry.

 I was afraid to eat the food Concerned that It may have been tampered with. A word of advise to Corporate and Franchisee alike. I will be sure to spread the news about my Very Poor service at this establishment.  With that said, Hopefully the drive thru will continue to look like a ghost town until your business is no more. And when it happens, Just remember the service @ your establishment is POOR, POOR ,POOR : ("}
{"text":"This was literally the cleanest fast food restaurant I've ever been in. My boyfriend and I stopped here after work today, the food was fresh, chicken was juicy, we didn't have to search for a clean table. The staff was amazingly pleasant! Everyone had their hair back and, from what we saw, using proper food safety. The restrooms were clean (which is good because I do not like to use public restrooms). The decor was great, and the ambiance was in point!"}
{"text":"I am truly disappointed in the Popeyes at this location.  I found an ant in my meal !!! When I was taking my chicken out of the box an ant crawled out.  To make matters worse my niece told me another time she went that she got bit by a red ant which causes her finger to swell a complete different time !!! I'm never going here again."}
{"text":"I was excited to see Popeyes in McCaren Airport and decided it would be my Thanksgiving Dinner. I ordered the three piece combo and it was... terrible. The chicken was dried out and not the moist, crispy, mouthwatering taste that PLK are known for. Reading another Yelp from Brad G., it must have been under the heat lamp for awhile. Added to this, the service was slow. It can't be that hard to throw a wing, thigh, and drumstick into a box. Made me sad :-("}
{"text":"Holy Louisiana Style Hersey Squirts!!  This place gave me the flaming runs!

This location was a little messy, bits and pieces of food could be found at all the tables.  Service was fast, staff was friendly and efficient, and the food was tasty but greasy.  Super greasy!

I forgot what my subordinate ordered, but it came with some chicken and he enjoyed the meal, and I ordered the popcorn shrimp.  

Overall a decent location if you into the greasy kind of food and my subordinate says the chicken is the bomb!"}
{"text":"My mom and I came here for dinner. And Britanee was working the cash register and she brought a smile to both of our faces. She was so friendly and upbeat that it really made our night. She is a wonderful employee and she really made a great impression on both of us. So thank you Britanee for your hard work and your lovely smile!"}
{"text":"They have the best meals and very friendly stuff . I like the manager following and care for all customer"}
{"text":"Been here 10-15 times, usually drive-thru. 95% of time the food is good. 50% of time they forget my dipping sauce. 1 time they forgot my fries. 1 time they forgot I had pulled forward to wait for tenders. That day I got my food 30 minutes from the time on the receipt. They gave me 2 extra tenders as compensation. At this point they owe me 15 mardi gras mustards and 20 minutes of my life back."}
{"text":"This place is good but very greasy only come here to eat if working near by with my buddy Muza this guy loves the chix sandwich."}
{"text":"My mom loves the chicken at Popeye's, so i pop in every week before i head to her place nearby. Terrible customer service (if you want to even call it that) at this location. They are so rude and never willing to accommodate orders if you want to add or change a piece from their dinners. They just want to charge extra for everything. Which makes you pay more for that than the meal itself. Chicken is ALWAYS to spicy especially the kids meals, i ask for mild all the time. Just last week they refused a customer ordering 15-20 minutes before closing because they didn't want to make it. There is always a ridiculous amount of chicken left under the warmers near closing. I bet they reheat it and sell it the next day."}
{"text":"I had an early morning and I skipped breakfast. On my way home I spotted a Popeyes and I've been craving chicken lately. So I ordered a 2 pc meal with a side of mash potatoes and Mac and cheese (I know but I've always wanted to try the Mac and cheese and I've always been advised against it and now I know why).

The food was decent I like the spicy blend in the fried chicken. I just prefer less skin and batter I like a thin crispy skin but most people don't. The mashed potatoes are fake but I actually don't mind them. The Mac and cheese is absolutely disgusting. It doesn't even taste like cheese it just taste like flour and milk. The noodles were undercooked as well. 

The service was excellent super friendly people behind the counter!"}
{"text":"Ok so I love Popeys let me start by saying that  but this particular location drive me nuts. Its not the staff so much as the lack of having the type of chicken your looking for as well as condiments. I don't eat friend food that much so when I do want it its either Chick Fil- A or Popeyes . I choose Popeyes for the fact that I can get wings legs thighs you know any part of the chicken where as Chik- Fil -A only really chicken breast. So here's the problem if I'm choosing Popeyes for that reason how mad am I when I go all the way over there and can hardly ever get the pieces of chicken I want or original vs spicy. they never have wings and barely legs. Then I love the biscuit with honey but why they barley ever have honey. I mean are they not ordering enough supply do they not fry enough chicken? I hate to leave a negative review for the chain but this is really getting on my nerves."}
{"text":"It took me a total time of 30 minutes to get a meal ,horrible service. 

The staff were taking other orders as well as working on customers orders that came after me. All I had was three chicken sandwiches - if I knew it would take me 30 minutes I would've never ordered.

I asked them if they put the sauces I want into the bag, when I got into the car and drove away I realized the sauces were not there. I drove back to ask to speak to a manager and she said she was in charge. told her the wait time was ridiculous and she didn't even look at me and said \"I apologize\" quietly. Horrible horrible service!!!!"}
{"text":"Took 20 minutes to get a small red beans and rice, small gravy, and small fries since they are making everyone wait in numerical order. All of the order was items that take a minimum time to scoop into a serving container, yet was made to wait behind people getting large chicken orders.  My party was done with their food from other vendors by the time I received mine.  Not cool. The ladies behind the counter were rude to others who were waiting on them and their incompetent method of order filling. By far the worst service I've gotten in any Popeyes restaurant."}
{"text":"I love me some chicken but this place needs help. Sometimes they are out of chicken so I have to park to the side and wait. I waited about 20 mins when they cashier said my food would be ready in 10. They also forgot other items that I had ordered as well. If you are in a rush to be somewhere  but are wanting food from this place. Make sure they have it made already or expect to wait."}
{"text":"What a waste of money and zero value...for $8.29 I got a \"platter\" that probably wasn't big enough to feed my 7 year old niece....tiny pieces of fish and 5 fries included....what a rip off."}
{"text":"The food is fine but the service at this particular location is so bad I felt compelled to come here and call them out. I see by reading some other reviews here that it's not just me whose had bad luck at this location.

I go to this Popeye's mainly because it's convenient (I shop at the WinCo behind it) and I love the biscuits- addicted actually. 

In my experience at the drive-thru, about half the time (no exaggeration) they get my order wrong- wrong side item, wrong drink, forgetting the biscuit or dipping sauce. It's always something. I hate to have to do it, but I've had to get in the habit of opening everything up and checking everything before pulling away from the window. I know it pisses off those behind me, but it's necessary at this place.

The staff, as mentioned, also seems to have a real \"don't give a shit\" attitude. This is purely a fault in management. They either can't or won't motivate the workers. I was there a couple days ago and it appeared that the young man working the drive-thru window was actually on the ball but he was working along side a manager who seemed to have a deer in the headlights look to him. The kid was actually telling the manager what needed to be done and was having to correct his mistakes!"}
{"text":"My wife and I happened to check this Popeye location out as we were doing chores in the area. We were craving for some fried chicken!

The cashier was super nice and friendly with us. We went ahead and ordered the family meal. We were so hungry and asked politely how long it'll take to make our orders. The staff said about 10 to 15 mins. So my wife and I decided to walk around instead of waiting. 

When we came back our orders was ready and I can feel it was warm. We live in the Bridle Path area so it's pretty much around 25 mins drive to get home. Was surprised to find that our meal was still warm and the chicken tastes deeeeeeeeeelicious!

To conclude, will we come back to this location?  Yes!

Food:  5/5
Ambience:  4/5

Cleanliness:  3/5"}
{"text":"There are few things better than Popeye's chicken, and these guys make it well. It isn't the fastest service in the world, but it all came out super hot and fresh. So ya, if you are looking to treat yourself to some deep fried chicken come here :)"}
{"text":"Ordered three 5 pc Sweet & Crunchy combos. Got home and they were all three pc, plus one had 2 pieces of S&C and one spicy piece. The spicy piece looked really old. Before I left the drive thru, I had to ask for sauce and was only given two. Two sauce cups for what was supposed to 15 chicken fingers? Seriously?"}
{"text":"So happy to have a Popeyes close to my place. I got some crazy good coupons in the mail for their opening.  5 pieces of chicken, two sides and two biscuits for 5.99.  That's enough food for this lady for a few days. The service is good and the restaurant is clean. My only complaint was the chicken was a little salty.  Less is more.. Other than that the food was great as usual."}
{"text":"I Love Popeyes Chicken. This location sucks however. Service here is always horrible. Never coming here again. Came to the drive thru about 5:49pm ordered an 8 piece meal spicy. I was told it would be a 6 mins wait. All good with that. Pulled forwarded and waited patiently. A car behind me also ordered their food and pulled forwarded and waited. About 6 minutes later that car got their food. Hmmm I waited patiently for a few more minutes. A few more cars came through. 
It's been about 15 minutes now. I walk to he drive thru window. Manager sees me and ask what I wanted. I explained what happened. I didn't want to wait anymore. Asked for refund. Zero customer service what so ever. No apologies, no explanation, nothing. He just asked for my card that I paid with and gave me the refund. Wasn't even going to give me s receipt until I asked for it. 

I have tolerated their bad service many many times. This was the last straw."}
{"text":"Just left the restaurant everybody there was so nice. We are greeted with beads buy gentleman named rhythm. All of the staff were very helpful and on our way out Rhythm thanked us for coming and told us to come back and reminded us about the survey which my son insisted upon filling out and giving 100%. Great service today"}
{"text":"Well I guess you now have to double check your orders if you go through the drive through. I hate paying more And getting less than what I ordered and was charged for. You repeated the order back to me at the pick up window and still got it wrong. This sucks.... and it wasn't busy!!!!! Horrible. I see why they are closing down if that's the best you can do"}
{"text":"Today we stopped in the food court for a snack, late lunch?! Since the other people with me went to other places in the food court, I was on my own to order whatever I wanted. oh yeah! So what did I get? The kids meal. For $3.99 it was a great choice. I got two chicken strips (buffalo sauce), a side of beans and rice, a biscuit, and a drink (that I refilled). Whoa, that was a nice snack for the price. 

The service was quick and friendly.
My meal was packaged well.
There was ice in the machine and lemonade was a choice."}
{"text":"The red beans and rice is good. I opted for the butterfly size shrimp because the popcorn shrimp is too small. The shrimp were way over battered, you can't really taste the shrimp. Maybe I'll try the chicken strips next time or just stick with the red beans and rice.......The place wasn't very busy even though it was lunch time."}
{"text":"Ordered a family meal was told to pull up and park, so we did. 25 minutes later and multiple cars going through the drive thru and still no order. We went inside to ask if they forgotten us and the guy that took our order didnt even remember us ordering thank god for our receipt and finally got our order. Very bad service!"}
{"text":"It's Popeyes - ridiculously quick, okay food, pricing is not bad too. Not super greasy, but not super flavourful either."}
{"text":"It was great when it first opened. Unfortunately it's gone to shit now. My past 3 visits have been disappointing. I got chicken that had been fried in old grease and large sides that we're half filled. 
I've returned time and time again hoping that things would be back to being awesome but I've been let down each time. I really hate to say it, but I will never come back to this location :("}
{"text":"I spent over 20 minutes in the drive-through. There was only one car in front of me. I only ordered a large fry and gravy and they couldn't even get that right. The fries I ended up getting were cold and when I tried to ask them to make more they kept me waiting another five minutes at the window before I decided to drive away in disgust. 

DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS LOCATION!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had a craving for fried chicken on a Saturday night. The closest Popeye's to me from Gilbert happened to be this one. I knew it would it be adventure going into Mesa on a Saturday night. I drove right by it looking for a restaurant, little did I know it was located in a gas station. Wow! Classy! But I wasn't going to Popeye's for fine dining but some fried chicken. I order my food from the clerk who was not happy to serve me, never asked how I was doing or thanked me for my order. Like previous reviews stated the restaurant is very messy. There was not a clean table in the restaurant. I wish I had remembered my hand sanitizer. After wiping down a table with some napkins. I ate my chicken, even though I ordered spicy they gave me mild. I knew it wasn't worth bringing it to their attention. The staff struck me as the type that would drop my food on the floor and serve it to me. The chicken was decent but I felt dirty after sitting there for 20 minutes. I will go to Popeye's again just not this one."}
{"text":"Drive Thru is horrible !!! Went 2 times in 7 days both drive thru! First time was wrong side order but it was yummy so whatever right. 2nd time I order 3 Apple pies was told it would take 8 minutes, they are so yummy waiting was fine. Got home to 3 cherry pies! Just sloppy work ethics dang it!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to know that we were getting this newest addition to our neighborhood as the food choices have been very scarce. But in any event, we decided to try the new restaurant for dinner last night. As soon as we walked in I noticed the mayhem. It was so many people doing so many things at once and not enough people sticking to one task in order to make everything flow smoothly.  I was hesitant to order I was really craving wings .We got 16 piece family pack meal which included three sides,  8 biscuits.  I specifically asked for 8 wings, 4 breasts and rest could be mix of dark meat. We waited for about 20 minutes to get our food. We got home , and what do you know..we had a box full of old thighs, no other pieces. My biscuits were missing too. I was so pissed. I had to drive back to the restaurant. I tried to keep my composure as  as best as possible considering that we had dropped like 33 dollars on this meal, but when I told them what happened they had the nerve to tell me all we were out of chicken thats why you got what you got. What the hell???!!! This was a bad move. My response was why didn't you just tell me and give me the option to wait?! So nonetheless, I had to wait another 15 minutes for my food. I made sure i checked it before I left.  I got all my chicken fresh , three new sides... my biscuits finally and also apple pies. I don't recommend this spot at all. I was not the only customer that experienced this nightmare there was three other people that same night that had the same problem that I did."}
{"text":"popeyes can really do no wrong."}
{"text":"I ordered a 5 piece chicken strip meal and it came with like 3 strips and little fried pieces of something (maybe skin). My jambalaya was half full. For the price they charge they should be giving you what you order. Not to mention the strips are the thinnest things I've ever seen. I will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Been to this location twice now and they haven't gotten my order correct either times. They need some help with their listening skills. 

Oh and there's a hair in my mac n cheese."}
{"text":"worst ever. I asked for 3 thighs they gave me 3 breast. All of them were dry and very salty. it was leathery and tasted like it was made two days ago. they tried to pass it off in the drive thru to get rid of it.PEOPLE STAY AWAY FROM THIS POPEYES I've been throwing up for the past 4 hours . WORST EVER.IF YOU DONT BELIEVE ME THEN GO EXPERIENCE IT FOR YOURSELF."}
{"text":"Only reason they get a star is because I have to for this to post, other then that a negative rating!!!! I agree with all the complaints! This place sucks! The manager sucks! The staff sucks! And for the price, corporate is gonna here about this.... Laugh at a person who has never been to you establishment and have your staff join in for a first time guest with a \"stupid\" question....Great manager"}
{"text":"This place is pretty much a disaster all around. From service, cleanliness, food quality. I mean everything. 

I always vow that I will never return to Popeye's but once in a while I get a craving for spicy fried chicken. 

This particular visit I was greeted with a \"for here or to go\". Oh, miss, are you speaking to me? How about a \"Hi, welcome to Popeye's\"? She was really, really rude and unfriendly the entire time I was ordering. I know it's probably tough to work there, but damn don't let your anger out on the customer.  

I will say, the food was ready very quickly, which probably meant it had been sitting there for a while. 

I ordered take out because I didn't want to be in that Louisiana hell hole for another minute."}
{"text":"We ordered 20 tenders they we're overcooked and dry when I opened box at home. I'll doubt I'll ever go back there again!!"}
{"text":"Found metal shred in their fries. Told the manger lady about it. She thanked me for bringing it to her attention and proceeds to tell me it \"sometimes happens\". She did nothing else about it. I could not believe how nonchalant she was about this horrifying experience. I really like Popeyes and it's a shame places like this absolutely ruins your experience and also puts customers at a major health risk by completely disregarding health and safety codes. I really don't expect anything from fast food places but this is just the worst experience I've had. If you care for your safety do not go near this restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried it three times because kids wanted to.  Two of three times they stiffed us on sides in the take out bag.  Shame on me I guess for expecting it to be correct.  Last visit in addition to missing a side it was simply gross.  The tenders are complete rubbery and mostly cold.    Was hoping for more, we need options in surprise.  This is not one. They offer you a feedback form online but it asks for way more personal (for marketing) info than they need to solve a problem.  Terrible."}
{"text":"Not hard to mess up some tasty fried chicken but it's  ALWAYS cold from this spot. I live a mile from here but drive to the one on decatur and 215 instead for better service and food. You would think they'd all be alike."}
{"text":"The wait was long and by the time we received our order, I smelled all greasy. The flavour for the chicken was fine but very oily. We prefer the KFC more! Where they are more efficient and the staff are more nicer."}
{"text":"Took almost half an hour between getting in line and receiving my food. The spicy tenders I ordered were dry/stale. Fries and biscuit were fine."}
{"text":"1x food poisoning
2x got my order wrong
multiple times with rude service

Not sure if that's good or bad for a fast food franchise. Par for the course I suppose. Like any popeyes location, you're playing russian roulette. Was the food poisening worth it for the multiple other times I've had some very delicious chicken? Probably, I still go there. At least there's lots of parking."}
{"text":"Unfriendliest welcome from who seemed to be the Manager of this place who took my order. I walked in from an empty restaurant with no \"Hi, welcome to popeyes \" at least. To make it worst, the person (black lady wearing a different uniform and had a headphone) taking my order looked like she was gonna eat me while taking my order. Lol. I swear this girl needs to undergo customer service training extensively. After she handed to me my order, she turned her back and didnt say thank you at all. I guess some people are not grateful they have a job because she looks like she was not happy doing what she is doing.  Be thankful I was in a happy mood when I walked in otherwise your arrogant behavior will find its way being reported to your corporate management."}
{"text":"Great food as always. The red beans and rice is spot on. For fast food this place delivers some pretty amazing chicken. I always prefer Popeyes over KFC. For a while it seemed like they were closing down. Glad they have them in more places now."}
{"text":"Everyone at this location was so friendly and helpful during our visit. The sweet tea was perfect and the chicken was cooked perfectly. They even told us they were waiting on fresh fries and brought them out to our table. 

I'll definitely be back for a quick fried chicken fix when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is your typical Popeye's Chicken. The shop is very new and the employees greet you as you enter the place. In my experience, the food comes out hot and fresh (mmm... biscuits!) .. but maybe it doesn't if they have not been busy.

A general complaint I have about Popeye's in general is that their specials are on a digital display, so you have to sit there and wait until you've seen them all. Only the \"regular\" menu items are on the main menus. Read fast or you have to wait longer...

This one currently has only one Coke Freestyle machine, so there is usually a line for drinks. There are two iced tea dispensers (sweet and not), but you still have to wait to get ice. Also, no Hawaiian Punch. You can get Hi-C, but Popeye's is one of the few places that usually had Hawaiian Punch in the dispensers. In fact, I remember when you could buy it by the gallon at Popeye's. Oh, well.

They have a huge variety of dipping sauces and the chicken, biscuits and sides are good (I like red beans and rice, mac 'n' cheese, 'mashed potatoes..."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Popeye's Chicken. We went last week about an hour prior to closing. I ordered a chicken tender combo with a side of mac and cheese. The chicken was very crispy, hot, and tasty! However, the service wasn't so great. I ordered a three piece chicken basket and received a five piece. I decided to check my receipt after leaving the drive thru window and then realized that I was not given one. Also, we were not provided plastic silverware with our order so we were unable to eat our sides in the car. I will probably visit Popeye's again in the future but if so hopefully a location where the employees are trained well or I will simply just need to remind myself to triple check my order."}
{"text":"Visited this location a few weeks ago. The guy who took our order through drive through was nice. We were asked to pull around and wait because we ordered a pretty big order of chicken and some sides. When we got home the chicken did not taste very good for how much we paid for it. It seemed really dry. They didn't throw in any sauces either which was a bummer. The area is also not the nicest. I was unimpressed with this location and will not be returning."}
{"text":"If there's a Popeye's nearby we like to swing by.  We eyed this one on our way to the Cosmopolitan so we bookmarked it in our heads for maybe later as we were headed to a buffet at the Wicked Spoon for brunch.

Hours later, we made a point of coming back over.  Place not too busy.  Hubby ordered 4 pieces spicy with mashed potatoes.  He didn't declare white meat or dark meat.

Our friends ordered spicy all dark meat with fries.

We get back to our timeshare to chow down.  Our friends opened their box to find it's a combo of dark & white. With the fries.

Hubby opened his, and it's all dark.  With his mashed potatoes.

Now how can the folks at Popeye's mess up?  On top of each box, the order was marked correctly. Probable cause - too many workers standing around and not paying attention.

The worst part - the chicken was overcooked and very dry."}
{"text":"Rude and inefficient. Took forever. They couldn't even speak English to get my order. After pointing it out they got it. Food was good  that's the only reason for more than 1 star."}
{"text":"So we decided
POPEYES CHICKEN sounded good
So we drive 10 miles round trip to get hot fresh mild (6) $1.69 Tuesday specials. And the 1/2 lb popcorn shrimp meal for my wife.
Her second piece could not be harder if they left it under heat lamps for 3 hours the biscuit was brick like so such a degree butter would not obsorb.
I feel horrible that some how she always gets screwed when it comes to her food.
How hard is it to make a meal fresh.

Guess that will be the last time

Can someone fix this?"}
{"text":"I see that I'm not alone on this judging by some of the other reviews, so. . . I too was glad they built this store near us, but every trip so far has been a disappointment. The food is typical Popeye's fair, but the accuracy of the orders is terrible. I've never picked up an order (counter or drive through) that I didn't have to go back and get something fixed. They bring the food to your table, but it's always been incomplete or wrong. You have to ask for things they should provide automatically, like butter (which is real) or honey (which is not honey) for the biscuit and such. On one occasion my drive up order was only half there and they forgot the drinks entirely. I'm hoping they can get it together pretty soon or I'll be Raisin' Cane or going to Slim Chicken. KFC might benefit as well."}
{"text":"I would go to another Popeyes if I were you! After 30 years or more of eating Popeyes, a Louisiana native and a great cook I might add. I think this is the worst chicken I've had at a Popeyes, very dry and old. Also my order was wrong, but it seems they do that a lot! Steer clear, go up the road a few miles or just cook your own but DO NOT go here thinking it's authentic, it's the same recipe with poor execution!!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the WORST fast-food experiences that I've had in my life. Cleanliness was DEFINITELY not their priority. The workers all seemed in a daze and were moving extremely slow even when the line was short which ended up creating an even longer wait time. The manager did not make the situation much better when he stepped in to help his cashier along. With his bare hands, he wiped sweat from his forehead, wiped his hands on his pants, and proceeded to handle cash as well as customers' food orders. Needless to say, avoid this location at all costs!"}
{"text":"It was my friends favourite fried chicken. We live in Montreal and they don't have those there. First of ahh, the skins are amazingly good. Crunchy and flavourful. The meat is juicy and not too oily like KFC. Second, the French fried is really good. Seasoning is unique. 
But the menu is lack of options. I from Montreal an there aren't any Popeyes there. Kinda wish if they open in Montreal. I rather chose Popeyes over KFC."}
{"text":"Ordered 5 box of 3 tenders, side & biscuit, sides were fine, as I bit in the chicken tender it was hard chicken, not soft as it should of been, it's was under cooked as if it were still frozen, Yuck, so I can the restaurant & told me if I wanted refund, I had to bring the food all the way back today with my receipt to have it replaced?? First of all why I have to drive the undercooked chicken all the back in order to replace it, & it has to be today, bad customer service, you served bad chicken & all you say is sorry but you have to bring it back, yea NO, i wasted $6.50 & will never eat there again"}
{"text":"Bad service... The menu is vague ..... High prices...
The lady answered one of my questions then left , the guy who took my order seemed uninterested in helping with prices i end up paying 30$ for nothing ... Ice tea half a gallon is watered down"}
{"text":"I normally love Popeyes, but this location is terrible. The quality of service seems to depend on the color of your skin. They don't have any white employees. The manager is extremely rude and unhelpful. The last time I went there the chicken was really dry, so I asked the manager to remake it. Of course she refused, but she gladly remade it for the next customer, who was not white."}
{"text":"Love the food at Popeyes!  This review is for the drive-thru at this location.  Avoid it at all costs.  We have been through the drive-thru a handful of times and apparently we never learn.  Our order has been wrong every singel time we have gone through.  They are in such a hurry that they don't check your order and they pack it so tightly in the bags that it's hard for you to check it when they hand it out.  Save the wasted money and go inside...but still check your order before you leave."}
{"text":"This location is single handedly one of the worst places I've ever eaten. I was warned not to go here but decided to try it when in the mood for chicken and needed a quick meal. Let me save you the trouble: Do not eat at this location as the food is horrendous and service was incredibly slow. I don't know if they were severely understaffed but the wait was 15 or 20 minutes in the drive through and when we finally received our food it turned out to be undercooked and cold. I kid you not when I say the Cajun fries were probably made 6 hours before they were served. Completely inedible. Unless management changes stay away from this location."}
{"text":"Really no stars!!! 30 minutes to wait for chicken???? Popeyes need to step it up!!!! Because other chicken places will shut you down with that BS!!!!! This ain't fast food!!!!! Will never come back!!!!"}
{"text":"We've always have had good service when ordering our food and the staff is friendly the times we have been here. Tonight especially, we had left over chicken from a tailgate and we went in for extra sauces-nothing else- willing to pay for the sauces only. The worker replied that they aren't McDonalds and gave us the sauces for free. This. This is why we love Popeyes! Great food, delicious sauces, friendly service. THANK YOU!!"}
{"text":"The customer service at this Popeyes was excellent. we had ordered from a different popeyes on the west side when we got home we saw they had completely messed up our order.  I called this popeyes... long story short... This Popeyes is independent from the others BUT the manager was extremely nice. He was willing to make it right even though we didn't buy from his place. No we didn't get all our food replaced free and we didn't expect to once we realized he was independent. He did however make us feel appreciated as a customer and for the time we drove out there.  We got a couple pieces of fresh dark meat chicken for our time. Again very nice manager and a VERY clean restaurant. I would definitely go back to this  Popeyes. The chicken was good and the friendly service is worth it to us to go back if we are in the area."}
{"text":"I don't normally bother yelping fast food restaurants unless they're really bad, but this was my first visit to Popoye's in Charlotte and I was just shocked at the level of customer service considering I've never experienced that at any other location. I was greeted very promptly and friendly pulling into the drive thru, they repeated my entire order back to me while taking  my order, while paying and when being handed my order. I'm always asked to pull past the window and wait several minutes for my order, but not at this location. Food was all fresh and tasted great. Location looks new and clean from the outside."}
{"text":"They skipped my order and I told them about. They said they didn't see my order!!! I ended up waiting for 30min. This place is ridiculous. Never coming back again. They keep messing up the order."}
{"text":"The chicken is plump with a good coating. The sides are different but hit and miss - often watered down. The shrimp is terrible. Worst customer service I have had in a while. Twice I have done pick up and twice I have got home to find items missing and had to call them. The first time they told me to come back to the store if I wanted the missing items (despite the fact that they do have a delivery service). The second time I demanded they deliver the missing items. The employee actually argued with me telling us we were partially to blame for the missing items because we didn't check the TIED OFF BAG before we left. When the delivery arrived I verified with the driver that the 2 missing butterfly shrimp tackle boxes were enclosed. He said there was plus some free fries. The fries were overcooked and soggy, the shrimp was disgusting - tough and rubbery - and there was only 1 order after all of that! I tried to use the online complaint form, but it didn't recognize the location I went to (offering three other Toronto locations instead) and then  the final page where my contact info is to be added only allowed US States and ZIP codes to be entered. This was a referral from the .ca site. I called the phone line but despite the promise of speaking to someone, no one picked up - just recorded messages in a loop. I have enjoyed Popeye's greasy indulgent food at other locations but I'd be wary of using this one ever again (just above Wellesley at Yonge St)"}
{"text":"They are unable to tell a breast from a thigh, even when you pay extra for the breast.  Always check your order before you leave, because it will be wrong.  I didn't check again tonight, and ended up with 5 thighs and 3 wings.  I am done with Popeye's."}
{"text":"Sooooo the food is good. I mean you have to practically remake it when you get it because they just throw it in the bag like the food angered them in some way. The low rating is for the customer service and the quality of the food. The customer service was not great. I repeated myself 5x to the guy and was in fear my food wouldn't be right. Thankfully they got that right. I ordered the po' boy and 3 tenders. I had to remake the sandwich because he shrimp were EVERYWHERE! I pulled that sucker out and the shrimp was nonexistent. I'm like I DIDN'T ORDER THE VEGETARIAN PO BOY. Turns out it was just all in my frys. The frys were great and the tenders we great. Even if they were plain without nice sauce for them, no one even offered me them I'm the type of person that needs to be asked these questions and have them choose what flavor I want. This was my first time at a Popeyes and I can truly say this is the worst first time since my first time and I can't take either one back. So if you come for a good time and good food you may only get one YOU CANT HAVE BOTH SO DON'T BE SELFISH!"}
{"text":"My husband stopped here after a long day of work and went through the drive thru. He ordered a combo for me and one for him with an extra sand which. The wait was very long. He finally received his food and was told to have a good night. He got home to realize he never received his drinks. We looked for the receipt to find the number but he was sure he never received one. We called them several times and never got anyone to answer. Will not be stopping in to this location"}
{"text":"We went to this location as it was convenient a few weeks ago.  Popeyes in general normally has a small selection on sale (e.g. 8 pieces for $15.99 or whatever) but when we went they did not, so I picked up two orders of a 5 piece dark.  I actually didn't know I ordered dark but that is what we ended up with - rib/thigh/drum - THEN I realized it.  But this has nothing to do with the rating.  The pieces v. price was fair and before I got KFC buckets of dark for $12.99 and that is perfectly fine.  

Got it home and it looked like it was sitting for a while - and the breading was darker than normal.  Wife said \"not fresh/stale/soggy/not good\".  I said \"I agree we won't go back.\"  

Our go to is the one at Yonge and Bernard (doesn't appear to be listed on Yelp).  After YEARS of going there, I have never had any issues.  Oh well, we tried."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and thought a familiar chain would be a safe bet. By far the worst drive thru experience I have had with this chain. Employee was irritated when I pointed out that I wanted a sixteen piece meal, not just the chicken. I seemed to be a sincere annoyance when I pulled up to pay. Fast forward to arriving home to find out that they neglected to include my red beans and rice...the biggest reason I went there in the first place. Avoid it."}
{"text":"Not real pleased with my recent visit to Popeyes I ordered their manager special which is three thighs and for wings and they were the tiniest pieces of chicken I have ever had I could almost eat the entire box but I am not a pig I had three pieces and made a couple of side dishes at home and the chicken was just bland fried chicken and I ordered spicy. I think I will continue to go to Kentucky fried chicken on my side of town where you get what you pay for the same order from them I would've gotten a real sized piece of chicken and out something for a six-year-old. I generally do go to Kentucky fried chicken but today I stopped at Popeyes after my grandson's football game because it was close by and I had been craving Popeyes for a while but that craving is gone I don't see any value to spending that kind of money on something that looks like it could've been a pigeon"}
{"text":"This is one of the slowest places I've ever been to. I have been waiting over 30 minutes in drive through. I would have left but I couldn't. The service is terrible."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! It looks clean, it is well decorated, and it's larger than other popeye's places! The fried chicken is always amazing! Never go wrong ordering all dark and spicy!!"}
{"text":"POP EYE'S! SO GOOD!

I always get all dark and spicy. whenever I crave for some fried chicken, I just go there and eat a ton and let my stomach soak in all the spicy oil... yummmmmm what else am I supposed to say?! Trust me it's so crispy and it will all worth it!!!! AND it's cheap too!"}
{"text":"Don't eat here they serve moldy bread for their sandwiches I hope they call the health and safety board as the guy told my friend the bun was fine! Meanwell there is mould all over the bread!"}
{"text":"The cashier was so nice and friendly. I had tasty spicy fried chicken with some biscuits and mashed potatoes.  They have a Coke product machine so I got cherry vanilla coke and it was tasty!!!! You need a key to use the bathroom in the gas station but at least it was clean!"}
{"text":"Service was slow here, can't blame them, I wouldnt really be that happy to be working here either.  So many mistakes.  They got out order wrong. They didn't give us utensils.  They didn't us napkins.  They didn't give us cups for our drinks.  Outcome doesn't look good."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, employees seemed to be afraid to talk. Been their twice and food still terrible- chicken has no taste even the spicy chicken was very bland. Sitting area was very dirty. Only a few people inside eating. Sweet tea ha good!! 
Sorry, back to KFC..."}
{"text":"Ok, I have been eating at Popeyes for over twenty years. I was so enthusiastic to go get me some beans and rice and spicy fried chicken from the new Ppwer road location. This review is more about my service than the grub. I had to repeat my order several times at the drive thru. I felt she was not listening. Busy with a lot of other things? Maybe, no big deal. I get to the window and she hands me the bag with out my drink. No big deal, I ask for it but she did not know what I ordered or the size. Ok, I give it to her. I leave and open the bag to eat. No hot sauce. No napkins. No fork for my beans and rice. I open the container and it was less than half full. . Now I'm upset. The chicken was overly greasy, small and not as flavorful as I remember.it might have to do with it being over cooked. But, not a full container of beans and rice. Not good, not good at all. The food was still great and I will return but now I have to go through my bag before I leave. Maybe, better luck next time. Don't forget napkins for fried chicken or the hot sauce. Come on!"}
{"text":"i thought i was still drunk when i stumbled upon a popeyes. A MOTHER EFFING POPEYES IN THE AIRPORT!!!! WTF??? God is good. and i was still drunk.

after a mad March Madness weekend, i needed something fried and chicken to help me get through the corridors at McCarran. enter Popeyes. two words for you. WOW. WOW. i thought it was a mirage. and the prices were pretty reasonable. $9 for 2 pieces, a biscuit and coleslaw. 8 mins later i was smitten. i was just full of smite. you could hit quads on the river to beat my flopped nut flush and i would still be full of glee after eating here. it was soooo gewd! washed down with some diet pepsi (of course) and i was ready to sit at my gate and wait. and nap. 

POPEYES IS THE BEST FOOD OPTION IN THE AIRPORT. *ANY* AIRPORT.

take that to the bank."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by here while waiting for our flight on Southwest. This Popeyes is located in the C terminal. There is plenty of seating, however, we were here on a Saturday evening which wasn't too busy.  

We got a popcorn shrimp combo. The shrimp was freshly cooked and so crisp and yummy!  The fries didn't taste that fresh. The biscuit was good. They don't have any fountain water so if you need water, you need to buy a bottle. 

Workers were nice and making jokes. I'd eat here again if I'm at the airport."}
{"text":"I really don't do fast food that much but this is one of them that I do hit every so often. I've only ever had their fried chicken, biscuits and mashed potatoes with sausage gravy (which I love!) Not the greatest fried chicken but it's decent, pieces can be small which is a bummer but it's usually not dry or greasy. Staff is always friendly and I don't think I've ever gotten the wrong order which is usually a big problem at fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"I've never had a problem with this drive thru like others have complained about. I order mild and hot in the same box and I get the correct order and it isn't dry. I've never had to wait a long time. I've noticed signs up at the drive thru that they are out of a certain item but it's never been something I was counting on getting. I've never gone inside so I can't comment on that. I will continue to visit this Popeyes, it's convenient to home."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Clean dining room. Ordered the spicy chicken strips. Usually the spicy isn't too different from regular at other places, but this spicy has some kick. 

Just moved here from out of state and work nearby. Will be coming here again."}
{"text":"A big black Cockaroach ran across the the counter when we were placing our order. we stop the order and went to Jack in the Box down the street.  I would not go back!  Stay away!"}
{"text":"I placed an order with Erik and this server had the hardest time taking a simple order, the whole group suffers with a lack of brains!   You want to get annoyed go to this Popeyes and eat.   The owner should go on mystery dinners.   They could double their money if the place get rid of the current staff  and hired some leadership!"}
{"text":"Clean location which isn't too unusual since it's so new. The staff can be a little pushy to order if the line gets long.  I really didn't care for the cost, it was expensive for my family of 3. I didn't really think the chicken was that special, I did like the biscuits though. I would go here for biscuits and any grocery store for chicken."}
{"text":"The Chicken and Fries are pretty good... The Dining are is usually really clean.. Now for the real reason for 2 stars... 

Every time we go here, even when they aren't busy, we end up with a 30+ minute wait for food.. This is unacceptable for \"fast food\" Tough trying to entertain a couple kids while waiting on the food.. Now, the other issue, seems like always have newer employees, which to me would be an example of poor management for a high rate of turnover.. I will not be back, as the chicken is ok, but factor in a 30 minute wait, just isn't worth it.. 

I will still eat at Popeyes, just not THIS location.."}
{"text":"I enjoy having Popeyes, it is one of my favorite fast food places. My regular order is the spicy chicken sandwich. They have better biscuits than any other place I know, although you do have to have it while its warm. 

This location is fairly busy, since its on a major intersection and close to the mall. So be mindful of a longer wait time. Although its completely worth the wait, and nothing out of the ordinary. 

Its good to sit and eat there they have a larger sitting area than most locations, or great for take out also."}
{"text":"Great location and good service. It is a bit small so seating is limited but still, clean and great location. Always busy."}
{"text":"I would have given this 5 stars but...here's the good:

Skyler at the front counter is GREAT at what he does!  I have been in customer service for 35 years and KNOW a good employee when I see one.  Maliq and him made an excellent first impression.  They told me about the survey to get a free meal upon return, and went above and beyond for me.  Skyler knows his product, and did all he could, including forgoing or delaying his break to help this busy store.  He never said a word, but I know what I saw.  Popeyes is LUCKY to have him!  The restrooms, and store was clean and well lit.  

The bad is:
  The price is ridiculous!  $33 for a 16 piece combo?  I waited for more than 20 minutes.  Unfortunately, the team behind the front counter makes a lot of mistakes which poor Skyler had to constantly apologize for.  In my case, I didn't mind waiting for fresh chicken fingers, but to then have my food under a heat lamp waiting even longer for fries does not work for me.  Skyler tried to tell some little girl packing orders about my order so he could get a break to grab a bite.  He didn't get the break while I was there, because he had to return to the front counter to wait on people as the place started to fill up with customers inside the dining area.  The drive through was more than 12 deep when I left.  When I arrived home, I had NO barbecue sauce as requested.  Since I cannot count on Popeyes to give me my sauce which was part of my nearly $34 order, I just can't and won't return, even for the free meal.  The spicy chicken wasn't spicy, and 2 good people like Skyler and Maliq cannot run an entire restaurant effectively.  

My initial impression because of the front counter is that this location is much better than others.  When I saw someone in the kitchen with no gloves near food, that made me wonder.  He did use tongs for the chicken, but seeing hands with no gloves.  I would have liked to return to try their red beans and rice, and maybe take some pies home for desert.  The store has such potential,  You don't get a second chance to make a good first impression."}
{"text":"Super rude employees. Please don't go here. Whenever I visited, I feel like I'm begging for their foods. Everything here from food to service is below the standard. I wish I could give 0 star."}
{"text":"One question. Who are you hiring? Every time I have visited this location my order is missing food! Tonight was no different! I order something simple. The five piece chicken tender. I get three pieces.... seriously!!! I am done! Not more service from me at this location I'll drive to Camelback and Dysart location. Can some district manager please check this place?!?!?"}
{"text":"Fast food places are the bottom of the barrel on yelp and almost all of them have very low reviews due to the fact that no one is experiencing culinary genius at any location, however I also think that these places deserve a positive review for good experience and don't get nearly enough of those!

I've frequented this Popeyes location for lunch and am allllll about their tenders. I usually always opt for their 3 tender combo (tenders, side, biscuit, drink). I've had experience inside as well as the drive thru and I've always been helped by friendly associates. A couple of things I've always liked about Popeyes is that they have a variety of sides (Mac and cheese, rice and beans, mashed potatoes, fries, coleslaw, etc) and you have the option of getting your chicken either \"mild\" or \"spicy\".

On this particular visit I had a quick visit through the drive thru. I got three tenders, Mac n cheese, a biscuit, and lemonade. I also grabbed some honey for my biscuit as well as their best sauce: blackened ranch. The woman working the window was super nice and the service was quick. The chicken tasted delicious as always!

Give them a chance! I would rank them in my top 3 as far as chicken tenders go."}
{"text":"Not first or second time more than four times I experienced bad service from drive thru ! 
They need to give proper training for the workers !! 
Zero tolerance customer service !!"}
{"text":"I bought 15 orders of special Tuesday. When i got home and ate, found out that they mixed around 8,9 pieces of those were frozen and fried again. The meat turned dark brown and very dried because they were fried over and over again. Should check your orders before leave."}
{"text":"This place is now bigger and free standing building across the street from the old gas station site. We've been waiting on them to move for a while, just don't feel right eating at a gas station!

Anyway, we placed our order, 8 pieces, spicy, extra crispy, mash with gravy and rice and beans, the young guy at the check out askes 'for here or to go' and we say here please. They put it in a go bag anyway, just like everyone else that came after us. I guess they aren't use to customers eating 'in'. 

It seemed like 30 minutes before our food came, so many people left who had ordered after we did, but it finally came. Chicken was hot, temperature wise, but spicey it was not! Crispy it was, and the skin just fell off the chicken, leaving it bare. It was moist and good but I like chicken with the skin. 

Our sides, red beans and rice was good but a bit runny and the beans a bit smashed but the mashed potatoes were good! The biscuits were also good. 

The place is clean, looks fresh, hope service gets better!"}
{"text":"Dumb ass people working there
Just went and ordered a three piece combo
You would think  some meat would be included !
2 wings and 1 leg not legally three pieces.
I called to complain and dumb ass people must not know what that ringing sound is."}
{"text":"Whether it's America or Canada or Mexico or even Saudia Arabia, Popeyes sure knows how to make some good ole fried chicken and its seasoning has been consistent wherever I've visited them.

This location in Toronto's outskirts was no different. I was visiting my family and happened to stop here for a quick bite. I went Inside to order a 3 piece meal and was met by a very friendly cashier.  I felt so welcomed.  As I started mingling with her, she convinced me to buy an 11 piece deal when initially I had gone only for an individual meal. I figured the entire family can enjoy some great southern soul fried chicken.

As mentioned earlier, the fried chicken was seasoned to perfection. And crispy fried. The pieces were of larger scale, and went great with their hot sauce.  Our mashed potatoes were delicious too. Whipped to perfection and loaded with gravy.  Biscuits with honey, made it a complete success.

Normally I don't review fast food places, but felt compelled as the food quality and service standards were above expectations."}
{"text":"Cashier was very efficient and pleasant, zero line up was a plus...

Wait for food wasn't as long as usual when I order the Cajun chicken sandwich....

Today it wasn't made to my standard, sandwich was very soggy in Cajun sauce and just tasted way to saucy for my liking 

Nonetheless place was nice maybe some music would brighten up the atmosphere"}
{"text":"I can't believe I forgot to write this review.... The service is terrible. They have plenty of staff, not sure why it takes so long to put an order out. The staff cooking/serving needs to change their gloves more often than they do - do they forget the cooking area is wide open and people can see just about everything they do??? Touching non food items with dirty gloves (sticky from chicken batter) and touching food again. I spoke to the mgr in charge and he didn't believe a word i said. Oh, no? Review one of the many camera's on site... Love the chicken, not this location. Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Went here once to order food since my little brother really wanted it. They got my order wrong and the food came out cold. I was not impressed and I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I was there the week they opened.  They would not honor the chicken special that is at every other Popeye's in town.  Also, they only give 1 strip in a kids meal.  Even for a small child that's a little lite."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times since Popeye's opened in Champaign. My favorites are the spicy chicken and red beans and rice. However. I went there yesterday to eat at about 1 PM, and as usual the counter person was very personable. I ordered a two piece spicy/white, red beans and rice and a jalapeno, paid $7.44 with tax. I picked up my food and poured some sweet tea into my cup at the counter. Went to where you pick up napkins, and there were none...in a fried chicken place!  I asked for some at the counter and they gave me a few. Sat down at my table and had a swig of tea. It was unsweetened, even though the urn was marked \"sweet tea.\" Went back to the counter and asked for some sweetener. Back at the table I looked at the two pieces of chicken. The wing looked like it was taken from a Cornish hen. I know there are large wings to be had from wholesalers, because most Chinese restaurants serve them. So I took the two bites from the wing, and started on the breast. It was very good, as usual, and a was fair sized portion. No problem with the beans and rice, either. There is a real problem with the biscuits. Whatever type of oil or margarine they use to brush the tops and bottoms has a pronounced artificial odor and taste, making the biscuit very unappetizing. As was leaving someone was refilling the napkin dispenser. The management needs to tighten things up around there, and Popeye needs to find some chickens that don't have stunted wings. There were two Popeye places in Champaign several years ago. Maybe they closed up because of these same problems."}
{"text":"AWFUL!! AWFUL!! AWFUL!!!!!!

We have gone here several times. Everytime  we are met with unprofessional,  rude, service!!!  The order is ALWAYS wrong! The crew definitely needs customer service training!!!  Save your money or go next door to wendys! Don't waste your time here!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Constantly messing up orders, staff doesn't care. How are you out of spicy chicken an hour after you open? No Tuesdays special. Geez Corporate really should step in. This is your name that is being affected."}
{"text":"My last experience was horrible enough but I guess I didn't learn my lesson.  I figured how could fast food be effed up a second time. Last time was over a 15 minute wait which caused myself and multiple cars to leave the drive thru. This time was not that long of a wait to order. But after I ordered I was told it would be a 10 minute wait for the chicken. Whatever I already waited in line and I was too tired to go elsewhere. Got home and got a tinkle of fries. I will give them credit maybe they're concerned for my health? 

What a joke. Go to the location on Rainbow."}
{"text":"Horrible service! I have ordered from here several times and EVERY TIME something is missing or incorrect. Two weeks ago I reluctantly went there. This time the order was so messed I finally decided to call them instead of just dealing without. This particular time one of the mashed potato containers had a hole in the bottom and mashed potatoes were oozing out into the bag and all over the car, (Clearly they had to see this before they bagged the order), I was also missing the extra chicken strips I ordered to go along with the meal pack, and I was missing the biscuits.   

I spoke with the manager and he told me he was sorry and he would replace the items for me. Since I did not want to go back the same day, he said he would put my name in a book and I could come at a later time to get the order. 

When I went today I could not recall the name of the manager. The manager on duty said he could not just give me an order because I claimed there was a problem. I told him he advised it would be in \"the book\". he reluctantly looked and found that he did in fact agree to replace my order. However they still did NOT get it right. I had ordered additional food to go with my replacement food and they still did not include the biscuits! 

I was so frustrated so I decided I would call him and let him know I will not be returning again. I called and the phone rang at least 20 times but no one answered the phone. (There were at least three people working there 10 minutes before). 

With Chic Filet, Raising Caines,  KFC, Slim Chickens, Chruch's Chicken and Bush's Chicken, all within a few miles of here, there is no reason to go back. Trust me...I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"It's Popeyes. Chicken was good, service was fast, just stopped for a bite to eat before the hockey game so don't know if I'll ever be back but... It's really small and it's inside the Circle K on the corner of thunderbird and 83rd. 

Parking is scarce unless your getting gas as well."}
{"text":"Loves me some Popyes and ecstatic that there's one even remotely close to me now! The service was friendly and pretty quick too! That's why I gave them three stars. However, looka here...if you gonna work at a fried chicken joint imma need you to know, I mean really get familiar with, the parts of the chicken! Nothing upsets a two piece spicy WHITE eater more than when finishing wheting your appetite with the wing then expecting to bite into that crunchy, juicy breast only to reach into the box and pull out a thigh instead!! It was too late at night and I do live a distance to take back.  It's funny how no matter which location, and I've been to many all over the country, Popeyes is the only chicken joint that continuously gets it wrong. May need a Chicken Parts 101 with employees! But lesson has now been learned, for the umpteenth time. I will always check the box before I pull off cause yeah, it is that serious!"}
{"text":"This place got the best chicken I had in a long time everytime u come the chicken is always fresh"}
{"text":"This Popeyes cannot get past the \"new\" store curve. I have been there twice and both times it was a 15 minute wait for spicy chicken. This time they were understaffed and the three ladies were clearly annoyed about it. Food tastes good but the service is terrible."}
{"text":"The biscuits and crispy spicy fried chicken was good. I barely eat fast food but I eat this at least once or twice a year. The spicy fries were decent but a bit dey and the mashed potatoes had weird crunch in it, as if there was bones or something in it.. that's not okay, I will refrain myself from the mash potatoes.. that's what I had to do.. sucks but ah well. Restaurants should really becareful in terms of packing food because you never know.. besides that, I sort of recommend this location."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would do not go here  i  received raw chicken strips and a biscuit that was so dry and salty it was disgusting"}
{"text":"I like having a Popeyes close by and having a choice between KFC and them. The drive thru was fast with the order being complete and hot. I'm loving the bean and rice side dish."}
{"text":"I know they are knew but I am a Popeye guy since the 80's in the south. It's the fist time I ever got \"jellied\" chicken that was under done. The coating was almost burnt and hard. Not good. The one in Gilbert is new but good. The on in Tempe on Ray is the best to me in my are. Sorry Chsndler, you have a lot of work to do."}
{"text":"Probably the cleanest popyes i have ever beeen to. It is a new location so i give them that but the staff is incredibly nice and helpful. Wish all popyes were like this one."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious chicken, served nice and hot. Very tasty & satisfying meal for family of 4. This Popeye's location (Aurora) is clean and well-run, service is professional. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"This location needs to have their staff go through training again. I saw the drive thru line was pretty long so I decided to go inside thinking it would be quicker. 
There were maybe four people that was waiting for food when I ordered mine. I ordered a 4 piece meal and the shrimp tackle box? 
As I see people get their food, I noticed every single person brought their food back. Either they didn't get a biscuit or something was wrong with their side so I made a mental note to check my order before I left the place. 
Next thing I know, it was myself and another person still waiting for 30 mins! I asked him what number his order was and it was five numbers before mine. After looking around we realized it was just us waiting for our orders. 
Finally one of the guys behind the counter overheard us and asked for our receipts then \"expedited\" our orders. That took another 15 mins.  
There was a guy jumping back and forth from the drive thru window to help the guy on the line. But then wouldn't complete an order causing confusion. The guy was clearly flustered and needed help. 
Finally he prepped my order. I thought the shrimp tackle box had butterfly shrimp but I got little popcorn shrimps. Then he said he gave me a couple extra and extra biscuits and he knew I was mad. 
Well come on. I was mad because I paid $16 for cold food. It's different if I waited 30 mins for a fresh batch of chicken. But so not the case."}
{"text":"I work in customer service as a manager and I would just like to say IM NEVER COMING BACK TO THIS POPEYES!!! Their customer service is the ABSOLUTE WORST. They can't even be bothered to do two separate orders in the drive thru... the couple ahead of me and my friends pulled out and left for the same reason. When I spoke to the manager Andrew he was completely stone faced, did not seem to give A DAMN about the inconvenience or annoyance when even the people at McDonald's can do separate orders!!! Like what kind of business is this?! You're supposed to make your customers happy.. and today you lost 3 customers."}
{"text":"Without doubt the best fried chicken anywhere! Tuesday special can not be beat...a leg and thigh for $1.29! Every Tuesday.
The staff is always friendly...a real step up from your typical drive thru.
Wish we had more locations in the valley."}
{"text":"I went to eat with my home girl Moyra. 

I haven't had good Popeyes chicken in a while. The chicken skin was my favorite! It was super crunchy! I ordered two dark meat chicken combo and mash potatoes. 

The customer service was wonderful. It's a fast food joint but one of the employees actually brought out our order instead of calling our name. Super sweet!"}
{"text":"Staffed with people with a bad work ethic and bad attitudes. I have had bad experiences 3/5 times there. In one order they managed to screw up 3 times. I asked for Mild and got Spicy. Asked for BBQ got Buffalo. Ask for sweet tea got unsweetened. This was one order for just one person. Not to mention if you ask for something or point it out even the managers have attitude problems. I rather drive to the one at Broadway and Dobson."}
{"text":"I'm going to preface this with the fact that I am sick and already irritated, but this was ridiculous.

Ordered from the drive thru and it took forever. The food was wrong (spicy chicken tenders instead of mild) and didn't know it until we got home. Brought the spicy tenders back to get mild, they tried to replace again with spicy. After another wait, was given mild but told it would be another 40 minute wait if we wanted the fries. Absolutely unacceptable.

I don't expect much when I go to a place like this, but I do expect consistency and decent service time. Tonight, we had neither. The store was clearly not prepared to handle their business today."}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience about 3 weeks ago. A women with a green shirt helped me and gave me amazing customer service. She was a shorter women with short hair, beautiful brown skin and brown eyes. I can't remember her name, but she was awesome. She went above and beyond to help me and my family. She definitely deserves some praise. It has been a long time since I have experienced customer service as high quality as this."}
{"text":"This place gets busy during weekday lunch hours since a few schools are in the vicinity. Chicken here is on par with other Popeyes. Wish they would keep the place cleaner as I'm often seeing their garbage cans overfilled."}
{"text":"Popeyes in by far my favorite fast food chain... When they give me my actual order. Constantly getting spicy instead of mild. Last time I came to this location they made me pull ahead and wait 15 minutes because they were making fresh mild chicken tenders. They came out with my order and the box was wet somehow. Of course I got home only to discover they had given me some old spicy tenders instead of the mild I had to wait for."}
{"text":"I've ordered here a few different times now and it's always delicious but every single time they forget to put things in the bag. I called today to speak to the manager for the first time explaining that this is the third time and he said you're the lady that missed the large cole slaw I said yes he said I tried to flag you down I said wow I didn't see you and it wasn't in the bag he said I'm sorry about that I'll try and be faster next time. Well I guess there will not be a next time."}
{"text":"I think I am breaking down! I think I am getting weak! I don't believe I have some Popeye's Fried Chicken spicy and loved it! Tomorrow I need to go to Bikram class in order to get rid of that piece of chicken!

The Toonie Tuesday $2.69 for 2 piece of dark meat chicken is within my cheap cheap lunch budget and I love dark meat. The chicken did passed my greasy test since I ate them 15 min after I order and the paper tray still not greasy at all.. That is a good sight.

The batter here has a little spice on it not overspicy, a little crispy and the inside is still quite juicy.

I prefer this much better than KFC.

I just ate the small drum stick piece and gave the big piece to my coworker to eat and she enjoyed that too!! 

The service here is quick and efficient!"}
{"text":"Restaurant was very dirty inside. The manager taking our order got it wrong 3 times. They've got 7 people working and still can't keep chicken ready to serve. Waited 7 minutes just to place our order to find out they had none and it would be another 15 minutes to cook some more. The spicy chicken strips (while had good flavor)  were extremely dry and small (more like large chicken nuggets). The green beans were cold, the large mashed potatoes were only half full and their soda tasted like the machine had not been cleaned in a few months. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Popeyes since 1983, however, this was the WORST.  I ordered an 8 piece (i.e., 2 breast, 2 legs, 2 wings, 2 thighs), and paid $14.02.  What I received were 8 pieces of extremely small, greasy, salty chicken, 4 thighs, 2 wings and 2 legs, not what I asked for -- they obviously don't know the difference between thighs and breasts.  The chicken was barely warm and I will NEVER go back.  There are many other places that have great chicken."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews but I've had issues the last two times coming to this Popeyes. Earlier this week I went inside and ordered a 3 finger mild box to go. Upon arriving at home (did not check the box before I left), I found a wing, breast, and leg instead. I do not prefer my chicken that way, so I just left it for my boyfriend to eat. Tonight (05/18/2016) I went to the drive-thru because I was craving chicken. They had to ask my order twice, which I usually do not mind because I have worked in fast food myself. Get to the window, had a short wait for fries. Ordered a 5 finger box MILD. Pulled out and checked my order, which seemed right. When I got home I realized immediately the fingers were spicy ! I can't have spicy foods and my boyfriend's medical condition is sensitive to spice. It really isn't worth all the traffic & construction on Rainbow to drive all the way down to this place. Twice I have left this place hungry and dissatisfied. Will not be going to this location any longer."}
{"text":"Okay so Popeye's has monthly promotions which air commercials.  So after the second time I figured it was time to write a review on this restaurant.  It appears everytime there is a promotion whether it be the $5 surf and turf or the big box.  This location never seems to have it.  They claim it's not on special despite having the advertisement on the windows and in the drive thru.  This is like a bait and switch with this location and it is constant.  Let me say the food is good but be prepared to pay regular price or go to the San Tan location where you can get the advertised deal the same day that this location claims that it is no longer valid.  It's worth the trip for some honesty. This location won't even honor the price although it's on the window.  Anyway no one seems to want to make it right since it happens on multiple occasions.  Best of luck I will go to another location i recommend you forget same until they get it together."}
{"text":"I should start by saying that I am not a regular Popeyes customer. Prior to this evening I have only visited Popeyes one other time inside of 10 years. Interestingly enough that one visit was enough to warrant a return. 

The first time I visited I commented that my girlfriend had never been and that it had been some time since I was there. The gentleman at the counter proceeded to explain the menu and even made some suggestions. We were happy with our service and the food was excellent. 

UNFORTUNATELY, they have ruined a positive visit with a horrible one. Tonight we were headed home and decided to drive through and pick up dinner. When we pulled in I noticed there were hardly any cars in the parking area and there was no one in the drive through line. We looked over the menu and ordered 8 mild tenders with a side of mashed potatoes. Our order was the smallest order for two people and basically the size of two combos (minus the drinks which we had drinks available to us at home). $19.44 seemed a bit pricey but we still continued. I gave my card and paid and decided we would have a mustard sauce for the tenders. It wasn't until after I paid that I was informed there would be a 3-5 minute wait on tenders. I said that we would wait. 

The young lady at the window then proceeded to tell me to \"pull up and park\". I promptly looked in my mirror to see no one behind me or even at the ordering menu board. I responded by saying that if another car came up I would move. She told me I needed to pull forward because it helped with \"labor costs\". I responded by asking either for the opportunity to stay where I was to get my food or a full refund. She walked away from the window. 

A minute or so later another woman came to the window and says \"I heard you want a refund\". I responded by telling her there was no one behind me and that I wanted to wait for my food at the window so I wasn't staring directly into the setting sun (not that it is any of her business but I have an eye injury that causes me to be extremely sensitive to light)or to receive a refund. Without hesitation she said she would process the refund and closed the window without any offer of apology or care. 

I drove to Wendy's across the street and was greeted nicely, treated fairly and with respect, and received two meals with drinks for approx $10. 

The issue with this store seems pretty obvious from my comments as well as the others I read. The service is lacking and communication with customers is horrible. If it continues they won't last long. I will be reaching out to the General Manager of this location tomorrow to make sure he is aware the level of service needs to be improved before he finds himself standing in the unemployment line with everyone else working there."}
{"text":"I have no idea why the service is consistently bad here. Until a Popeyes opens on Golden Mile Highway (which I would totally frequent), I have to rely on this out of the way location for my Southern fried chicken fix. 

The first time I had Popeyes, it was in an airport and the chicken was seasoned, crispy, light and superb. This location of Popeyes is extra greasy and heavy. The service though, is inexcusable. The workers here don't greet you, smile or respond well to any questions. I've been here twice and my orders were wrong both times. They missed my side last time and a biscuit this time. When you tell them to correct this, I was given major attitude and no correction. Also, can people working here go through training to entering coupons? It is not very difficult and absolutely does not take 10 minutes. 

My last complaint is about their iced tea. It's hard to mess up iced tea but their version is so heavily sugared and congested with syrup, I had to choke back a gag because of the artificial sweetness."}
{"text":"With trendy chicken finger places popping up like Raising Cane's, Chicken Bonz and BFG, it's comforting to know that one of the most consistently dependable meals around is an order of spicy chicken fingers from Pope Yes, the official chicken of the Vatican.

It's legitimately spicy even for a capsaicin burnout like me - but not excessively so. It's a nice warmth. Dip them in Mardi Gras mustard, redolent of horseradish and whole mustard seeds, and you're set.

The red beans and rice are the only side you need to ever bother with here. Not that the other sides are bad. They're just unnecessary.

When I'm feeling guilt and shame the grilled naked chicken wraps are so tasty that I don't even miss the batter and oil of the traditional strips.

Yes, it's a chain fast food restaurant.

Yes, it's attached to a gas station.

No, you shouldn't care."}
{"text":"All I want to say is that this is the only open Popeyes in the Pittsburgh Area. I traveled to 2 (or was it 3?) Popeyes locations on the same day, finding out that each one was closed and growing weeds before I came to this one. 

Good: If you're really craving an alternative to KFC or just want better chicken and biscuits, this is the place to go because this one is in operation!

Bad: kinda sketchy and not very clean."}
{"text":"The service is very slow, and some locations don't truly honor the Tuesday Special. Don't wait in a long line like I did for nothing! I drove to 3 locations today! Not good!!!"}
{"text":"Was visiting the area for NYE and had a hankering for a ready made meal to toast in the New Year. Had a coupon for the 14 piece Mixed Chicken meal. Arrived at about 7:15pm. The restaurant wasn't closing until 9pm. There was already little to no chicken left. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because they honored a coupon from another location, however that's the best part of the experience. It took well over 30 minutes for the order, the cooking staff got into a screaming match complete with slamming to kitchen tools and appliances, when I got back to actually eat, I opened the box to find 2 breasts, 1 thigh, 0 legs, and the rest very small wings and even a few flats from a different type/flavor of chicken that was offered there. I felt like my order was just thrown together an if so, why did it take 30 minutes for chicken that wasn't even fresh not a true mixed meal? I know folks wanted to get out for New Year's celebrations but they should have been closed if they didn't want business."}
{"text":"I was texting with my friend Kate and she had mentioned that she was going to Popeye's for lunch.  She planted the damn seed!  I had seen a commercial recently for their Pepper Barrel Tenders, too, and they looked delicious.  I decided to come down here for lunch.  I've been to this Popeye's a handful of times (surprised I never wrote a review) and its only about 2 miles from my work.  

I placed my order for the Pepper Barrel combo which comes with 3 strips, choice of side (fries), a biscuit and a drink.  $6.49.  Not bad..not bad at all.  Here is how everything was...............

Pepper Barrel Tenders-  Popeye's chicken strips are some of the best in the land.  When I used to live in SD, we could hit up the Popeye's in El Cajon a lot!  Glad to report that their strips are pretty consistent out here in AZ!  These Pepper Barrel Tenders are marinated in a Tabasco sauce and then fried up.  You could immediately tell that they looked a little different than the normal strips.  They were nice and spicy and had great flavor.  The tenders were a bit smaller than I had remembered, but they did give me 4 of them instead of 3, maybe to compensate the skimp size?  Anyways....I got some sweet heat sauce with them and they were delicious.  I would get them again for sure.

Fries-  Popeye's fries are hit and miss.  When they are good, they are really good.  When they are bad, they are flat out nasty.  Today they were really good!  Nice and hot, crisp and full of flavor due to their seasoning/coating.  If their fries were like this all the time, I would be happy.  If you aren't a fry fan, you can never go wrong with their mashed potatoes and gravy!

Biscuit- Popeye's biscuits are fantastic!  Full of butter, fluffy but sometimes they have a bit of a crunch when you bite in.  I love them and could eat half a dozen.

Drinks- Coke products...score!

Service is always prompt.  Maybe not the friendliest, but they do get you your food really quick.  One other thing.......for whatever reason, in my fucked up, crazy mind,  this Popeye's seems like it should have a bullet proof glass window up at the counter.  This Popeye's is not in the hood or anything, and it doesn't NEED a bullet proof glass window, but if it did have one, it would seem more \"complete\". Some Feng Shui type shit.   If I was a Popeye's architect, I'd definitely install one here!   Random, I know......right?  Anyways....Popeye's is good shit!  I know I will be back soon enough!"}
{"text":"Not sure about a lot of the other reviews of this spot........I had a great experience here!

The pregnant wife (If you are reading this, and don't know, my wife and I are expecting another kid in July...let's just make this shit \"Yelp Official!\" right now ;-)  Anyways.......) was craving some Popeyes.  When a pregnant woman craves something, you get off your ass and go get her what she needs.  I love Popeyes myself, so I didn't complain at all about coming down here to pick it up.  It's actually not too far from our place in Surprise.  

This Popeyes is rather small and its attached to a gas station.  As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by 3 different people!  It wasn't one of those, \"Welcome to Popeyes\" generic greetings either.  It was strong eye contact, and a welcoming vibe into their shop!  It was much appreciated.  For food, I had a coupon for a free 2 piece meal with purchase of a 3 piece meal.  My wife always gets their spicy strips so I ordered a 5 piece for her.  All together we got 2 breasts, 3 wings, 5 strips, 3 mashed potatoes, 3 biscuits and a drink for around $15.00.  It was a ton of food!

The food was good as usual.  Popeyes makes the best fried chicken (of all the fast food chicken places) and their sides and biscuits are always great, too!  I'm sure we will be back sooner than later."}
{"text":"Popeyes a mere 5 minute drive from my house?  Yes, yes indeed!  

This Popeyes opened a little over a week ago, and I have been here 3 times already.  Both my wife and I love Popeyes!   So far we have had some popcorn chicken meals, as well as some chicken strip meals.  Everything has been delicious!  Their chicken strips are large, meaty and pack some good flavor.  Their mashed potatoes and gravy are always tasty, and their biscuits are killer, too!  

This place is FAST with the service, too!  You order, and pull up to the window and your stuff is ready!  I've been to some Popeyes where they lag, but this one does not!  Very impressed with the friendliness of the workers and the speed at which they pump out the food.  I will be back often!"}
{"text":"Came here the other day to get some chicken. Great experience with the Popeyes Near Yonge/Steeles. For some reason this location's chicken was much greasier and had a slightly different taste - maybe they haven't changed the oil in some time or they are using a different type of oil? 

Anyways, below average when rating against other locations of Popeyes."}
{"text":"Don't ask why I would rate this place.   I have been a fan of their chicken for years.  It would be due to the spicy chicken and baskets w/honey.  Who can go wrong.  Just found out they do monthly special...so make sure you check those out."}
{"text":"Nesha provided exceptional customer service! She deserves 5 stars! The food was pretty good. The tenders were a little dry but tasty. A bit on the pricey side. The Cajun fries were pretty good. We'll be back, primarily because of the friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch hoping for quick service. Well, about 20 minutes after placing our order, we went to the counter to change our order to go. After waiting there for another 10 minutes, they brought the wrong order. We waited .... about 5 min later, they brought our order to us. We rushed out because we were now late. The order was completely wrong!! The sides were wrong and even the chicken was not right! All I can say is, if you like surprises, then this is the place to go! Otherwise, it may be best to avoid this particular establishment."}
{"text":"Chicken was pretty good for fast food.  I used the Drive-Thru twice, and both times they did not give me the sauce I asked for.  Employees seem over it.  Too bad.  Mac and cheese is decent if you are craving some quick mac and cheese.  Probably will not go back unless I have an unusual craving."}
{"text":"Service is fast , but the coupons advertised in their website for this location does not work. Although they were valid till Nov 19, I could not use them. The cashier said the deals have changed . Well then the website should have been updated. Why adverse if you are not going to honour it?"}
{"text":"Good fried chicken, usually freshly cooked.  Expensive, but what isn't in Vegas and at the airport?!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. They'll mess up your order. Always tries to give u legs and wings. The workers dress code is nasty. And they keep the place freezingk"}
{"text":"2 stars is accurate, the food is ok, not great and the service while friendly was really slow.  Bojangles is hands down much better for taste and service.  Not a do-over."}
{"text":"I LOVE Popeye's!  And have since I was a little kid so its no surprise this location gets 5 stars. As long as they don't screw it up and believe me I have been to my share of messed up Popeye's. Anyways, this location is fast, clean, and the employees are always kind and helpful.  I go here all the time to bring a quick dinner home for the family."}
{"text":"So this is first time at a Popeye's. Got the surf and turf plus catfish. The catfish was great! The shrimp was okay and chicken was above average. Wouldn't go so far as to say best ever but definitely decent. Prices a bit high compared to Church's but they got good food. On Tuesdays they have 2 piece leg and thigh for $1.29 plus tax. The legs are pretty good, I am not sure if I like the legs here or church's better tho... both are great."}
{"text":"The chicken here compared to other locations is awful and staff does not know what they are doing.  Asked for some of the spicy sauce on the side they had no idea what I was talking about."}
{"text":"I was excited when I saw the Popeyes opening here in Indian Trail. I had eaten there while on vacation previously. The first two times, I ordered the fish and shrimp meal. Both times, a couple of months apart, the shrimp was bad. Smelled bad as soon as I was handed in to me in the drive through. One last shot tonight. Fish and chicken strip meal. Previously I loved the fries and fish. This time,
The fish tasted old. And my fries were cold. Chicken strip was good. But not good enough to go back."}
{"text":"Jasmine the cashier was very professional and friendly. I've been coming to this location a lot when I get good chicken and most time I'm satisfied considering I'm a difficult customer. Jasmine was awesome in getting what I wanted. Thank you Jasmine!!"}
{"text":"There seem to be only three Popeyes left in Pittsburgh - Wilkinsburg, Wilkins Twp and the South Side.  And I've never seen another Cajun restaurant in these parts, so Popeyes is it.  Red-beans-and-rice, and (sometimes) gumbo, etouffee, crawfish and jambalaya. Plus the chicken is better than KFC."}
{"text":"Utter garbage service. Can't hear or do simple math, cashier is giving me the wrong change, after I complain I was given my money, she then starts badmouthing me to the manager name Jose, in Spanish, while I'm still standing there, I speak Spanish and let them both know that I can hear them. Learn English, elementary math and just how to treat other human beings on the most basic level."}
{"text":"We go to this Popeyes fairly often as it is close to our house. The food is good and the service is generally polite although not overly enthusiastic. Once we went in just before closing and got some extra chicken in our bucket because the owner didn't want to throw them out. The last time we went though it took 18 minutes from the time we placed our small order until it was handed to us and we walked out AND the chicken got packed up and THEN the guy who took our order told the kitchen to put some fries in the oil, not exactly 'fast' food. There was also a shrill woman talking loudly in the front office the entire time we were there, but it was late and maybe staff were just joking around to pass the time? Overall it is a pretty good location as far as cleanliness and service are concerned."}
{"text":"So the site says they stay open until 11pm? But they had the doors locked at 9:30 pm! What's going on?"}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally write a review for a drive thru, but because there is so many negative reviews I felt I had to say I had a great experience yesterday!
My food came out quick, considering the line was a lunch crowd and lengthy. My food was hot, done exactly as I'd ordered and was given the extra sauces I asked for without having to remind my cashier. 
He was extremely friendly, and I think his name was Edwin? 
We prefer Popeyes to basically any chains fried chicken, and I see a Canes is being built almost across the street. We're still going to continue to go to Popeyes!

The 5 dollar box is such a great deal too!"}
{"text":"At Popeyes at 12:14 noontime and there is await of 8 mins for chicken. Lunch must of caught them by surprise."}
{"text":"I feel horrible! I wrote a previous comment on this place, but it was intended for another place...my bad. Sorry.

I went here late at night and the staff was great! I just love eating chicken!!! I wish their chicken was more spicy; I'm just looking for that kick! I'm not a big fan of sweet ice tea and I can barely swallow one sip, but their sweet ice tea is yummy! Sugar cane sugar makes things wonderful!"}
{"text":"I have to say that if you haven't tried Popeye's, you're missing out!! I mean, it's so much better than that three letter place.  Truly.  If you haven't eaten here, you need to.

I had the two pieces deal, and ordered  corn ON the COB....OMG, seriously.  Just awesome.

Seriously, I am very afraid i might end up living here...it was so good.

I loved the biscuits too.   Slathered in honey.  OMG seriously.
And I loved the coleslaw too.  It was pretty incredible.  

And the apple pie was good too.  What can I say, I loved it!

OK , so it's my guilty pleasure.  I know I shouldn't, but damn, I just can't help myself!!!"}
{"text":"The MOST amazing fried chicken on earth!  Puts KFC to shame!

Just sooooo good!  Cooked in small batches, so it's always hot and fresh!

And the biscuits with butter and honey.... Awesome!

The Mac and cheese is soooo good too.... I'm home now, and I just realized that I forgot to buy some to take home......

Apple pie is also quite good! Lots of cinnamon!

You must try!

And this location is now huge, double in size... They took over the subway that was beside them!  Excellent!

And specials every day!  Staff are always friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"I've never had a truly good experience at Popeyes. So when this new location opened up near my house, I decided to give it a try. I set the bar low because I wasn't expecting much. Glad I set it so low because it was truly awful.

1. There were flies flying around
2. They advertised a Ramadan special even though the chicken is not Halal (I'm not Muslim by the way)
3. They wouldn't honour a promotion
4. Had to wait 10 minutes for fries
5. Chicken was incredibly salty - all you could taste was salt

Will not be going again."}
{"text":"Tuesday special, two pieces for $1.29. Chicken is always piping hot and juicy. They are always so busy on Tues that the chicken is always fresh. It's never old and just sitting there.

The workers are nice. You can have as many sauces as you want and they don't charge extra.

Plus one of the few places that still serve battered fries.

The $5 box is a pretty good deal too, but if they have seafood skip. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Horrible! The worst experience ever! We will never return to this location again! We usually have a great service and food from ALL other locations like San Tan and off Crismon. First of all the drive thru girl has a very strong accent that you could barely understand and she was rude and didn't listen and would cut you off while ordering. She should not be working the drive thru or front counter. We ordered the new popcorn chicken combo with fries and drink and we received about 6 fries and 4 small I mean small popcorn size chicken! Literally the size of a piece of popcorn for $5.50! Ordered my son the 5 piece tenders meal the tenders were extremely small compared to other places. Again, there was only a few fries to pay close to $8.00 for meal you would think you would get full. After getting home we realized they had forgot to put a meal in our bag. We assumed that was the biscuit box but for some reason they put a biscuit and fries in a box but forgot the chicken! Lazy!!! The workers had to be told more than once what drinks we ordered, I assume again that you typed that into your computer screen while I was saying my order! Workers running around having not a clue of what to do ! Worst service worst food worst experience! Popeye's Corp isn't going to like to hear all the complaining from one location! If I was the owner/manager I would fire everyone and start over!"}
{"text":"How stupid can employees be?

I ordered on the condition that I would get ALL legs and thighs.

What do I get?  included are 2 wings and a rib.

And guess what?  These intellectual midgets USUALLY CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A THIGH AND A RIB - so I USUALLY get a rib OR TWO included - and I hate white meat so much that I DO NOT EAT IT.

So I call these nitwits, and I get offered ONE free piece of chicken with my next order.

NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

Oh, and don't let them talk you into trying their Raspberry crème pies - they are INEDIBLE.  Mine came glued to the inside of the package it was in, and when I tore the cardboard off it and put the two pieces back together and took a bite - YUCK.  I wished I hadn't bothered wasting my time.  But my dogs might eat it.  Maybe."}
{"text":"WATCH OUT FOR THEIR PRICES!

Don't get delivery from this place without VERY CAREFULLY checking the price before you commit to an order!  You've been warned!

One of the last time I ordered from here - I wondered why my small order was about $50.

Well, I figured it out.  I just called them - because I was thinking of ordering again - but I was a little cautious, and I asked how much it would be for 12 pieces of chicken ONLY.  Just chicken - no fries, nothing else.

OVER TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS.  Is that with tax you ask?  NO.

Does that include delivery?  NO.

Just a bit of chicken and it's almost thirty bucks!!!!!  And they still add tax and a delivery fee ON TOP OF THAT.

NOW I understand why my last delivery was SO EXPENSIVE.

Watch out for these guys.  DON'T order without getting a breakdown of the price before you order.

Unless you don't care about money."}
{"text":"I come to Popeye's Chicken for the $1.49 two piece special on Tuesday's...There's always a long line for the drive thru... I'm always too lazy to go inside to order... I like Popeye's better than KFC... It's much more crispier and tastier in my opinion...Chicken is affordable on Tuesday's and I really like the sides here like the dirty rice, red beans and rice, Cajun fries..."}
{"text":"One of those many experiences where I should have read deeper into the many ratings.
Before I start I would like to say that there were 15 employees working when I was there. Seriously? I'm just going to assume it was a training session because no fast casual restaurant needs that many employees working and bumping into each other. 
I ordered an 8 piece Mix Box ($12.99) and 2 sides; Reg Red Beans ($1.99) and a Reg Mac & Cheese ($1.99).
The chicken was fine. Nothing special at all. K thought for the money I should have just picked up 2 whole roasted chickens at Costco. The sides? Well I can only comment on the Red Beans because instead of Mac & Cheese I got Mashed Pot & Gravy. And C was really looking forward to the Mac & Cheese. The Red Beans were fine, again, nothing special. For the 2 bucks, the size was pretty small as well. K ate the Mashed Potatoes and Gravy and she said it was fine as well, but again, nothing special.
Average Chicken, employees can't read/fulfill orders, price vs size ratio a bit skewed. 2 Stars."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place at all.  The service was horrible.   The black girl who served didn't even bother to greet customer with basic greetings needless to say I was waiting for more than 20min to have my order taken.   No apology, just rude."}
{"text":"Some times you just need to lubricate your innards and this is the tastiest place to do so. 

I get cravings for their greasy fried chicken but unfortunately there are no stores near me so when I see one, I am all over it!

This and In N Out are the only fast food places where I eat.  Gotta have some vices."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken tenders at this location, and the tenders tasted a bit stale, and the fries were not the usual spicy flavour, and were bland. Also, I realized later that they also over charged me for the meal. I guess not very ethical people at this location, because why would you steal money from customers. Hmm, don't think I will be visiting this location ever again."}
{"text":"WOW is all I have to say! I feel I lost brain cells just talking to the girl in the drive thru. Everytime I go to this place it's like pulling teeth to get my order not just right but whoever is taking the orders seems to be dyslexic and can't comprehend the difference between Cajun rice and Cajun fries. How this building is even standing still is beyond belief, I wouldn't let the people who run this place operate a lemonade stand! Absolutely pathetic!"}
{"text":"$4 per chicken wing led me to head to the sea. Popcorn shrimp and catfish $15 with one side and biscuit. Unpopped popcorn kernel outsize these dried crumbs from the sea. Where's the shrimp? 

Never again!"}
{"text":"The manager here is a black lady who is really rude. I don't know how she got the position. I love poppeys so I have no choice but to go there.  Every time I see her, she never smile and have rude attitude"}
{"text":"Even when I lived within walking distance from the Popeyes, I actually didn't start checking out this place until after I moved farther away. 

Most of the times if we're craving fried chicken, we'd think of swinging by the drive through for this Popeyes's and then order either the fried chicken or sometimes the fried shrimp as well. The quality of the food is on par with other fast food establishments. Service can be decent and there might be a bit of a wait. In which case, you'd have to pull up the car and wait for a bit before the staff brings out the food. (Usually shrimp is common for having a longer wait.) 

The best day for great deals is definitely on Tuesday where the family boxes of fried chicken are a lot more affordable in comparison to any other day of the week."}
{"text":"This place is a wreck. The restaurant is filthy. No one bothers to clean up all day apparently. None of the staff know what they're doing and they have side conversations very loudly so everyone can hear that they're cussing and what not. Very unprofessional. I won't be returning to this location ever."}
{"text":"Food tasted good. I loved the chicken strips.  The price is very good for what you get. The cashier how ever was very unresponsive and looked like she wanted to kill herself the whole time. 
I asked her to repeat the number to my order and she looked at me like she was deaf and I said is this my order and she acted like it was my order but didn't care to answer. I sat there looking at her then just grabbed the tray assuming it was my order."}
{"text":"I would give this location negative stars if I could. Came at 8pm on a weekday in the drive thru. They had me order only to get to the window after ordering to reorder my entire order. Paid in cash and was given the wrong receipt. Was given a bag full of food and told they were out of biscuits and I would not be getting one. Like you couldn't have said something when I ordered twice. Drove home only to have plain potatoes even when both times I ordered I asked for gravy. No utensils in the bag, no napkins. The only food that was hot was the fries. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else. A complete waste of time and money."}
{"text":"First time at this location I was served you Devino he was my cashier !!he suggested to me what would be good!since I never been there awesome service way to go !!"}
{"text":"I've known this placed existed for a couple of years, but a bad experience in Colorado has kept me from the chain. I recently saw a commercial for their new sweet and crunchy tenders and the planet's must have been aligned because at that moment I was having a craving for chicken wings. I know these aren't chicken wings but boneless tenders, but they looked pretty good on television. So with an adventurous spirit and an incredible hunger,  I got in my car and took the trip to popeyes. The drive thru was fairly quick, from order time to the time I got my food, about less then 3 minutes. Drive thru service was friendly. I got my order and started on my way home. At the stop light on Dysart and Glendale, I opened the box and grabbed a tender. Took a bite, and oh, what a bite it was! It was soooooooo good! I quickly made a uturn and headed back to Popeyes. Remember kids, making a uturn is a no no unless otherwise posted. I went through the drive thru again and ordered 6 more sweet and crunchy tenders by themselves. While waiting for my food, I decided to try their biscuit. Man, that was a tasty and flaky biscuit. Note to self, order more biscuits too. The first order also came with fries. Those were pretty good too. So in closing, just because you had a bad experience at another location, you should give other locations a chance. Since that first visit 3 weeks ago, I have made the journey to this location 3 more times. I never got to try the sauce that came with it because the tenders were awesome by themselves. One more point to make, while the fries were good after ordering them, they became limp and not so good after about 10 minutes."}
{"text":"I don't like giving negative reviews but I have had nothing but bad experiences at this location. From frozen french friends as my side to dry chicken that has sat under a warmer.  My most recent visit only confirmed this review, old mac and cheese that was mushy and slimy, biscuits clearly under-cooked but was still served.  Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Prices are a bit high, but decent service and really good tasting chicken."}
{"text":"CHECK YOUR FOOD BEFORE YOU EAT IT.
My girlfriend and I had ordered two Po'boys, no lettuce. We started driving off, and they opened the bags. They dug out their sandwich and immediately noticed lettuce, which was just picked off. That wasn't the main issue though. The real problem started when they had gotten halfway through their sandwich and had noticed MOLD on the end of the bread. 
Both of our Po'boys had some really crumbly and loose bread. Mine barely had a top to the sandwich to begin with. It was falling all over the place, and left a mess that shouldn't have happened. 
Getting Popeye's is always a game of Russian roulette.. 9 / 10 times if you go through drive thru, there Will be something wrong with your order. From our experience, if you just go inside, 9 / 10 times your order is going to be just fine. 
Expect a wait, regardless.
And if you eat at this location, check your bread.
Check your food in general."}
{"text":"If I could give this a negative score I would but I can't this place always takes a day and a half to have some chicken ready. They never have any condiments. Horrible service, somebody shut this place down or switch management."}
{"text":"Thank you to Eddy! He did wonders for The Junior League of Phoenix. He was helpful and knowledgeable with taking our Catering order! I highly recommend him for any large catering needs. Our New Orleans themed event was fantastic because of his close attention to details and his going above and beyond attitude. The backend chicken tenders are great!!"}
{"text":"Now, I didn't walk in here expecting haute cuisine; what I wanted was sodium and grease and I got it, but this wasn't really the best. 

A Real Meal a combo is two, three or four pieces of chicken with a biscuit, a side and a drink. The entry-level combo is $7 which is pretty expensive for what you get. You can also get a family-sized eight piece meal for about 21 bucks, and there are sandwiches, chicken tenders and some unholy-looking thing called a \"bowl.\" I opted for the two-piece.

I liked that the chicken was crispy, juicy and served hot. And the 'spicy' version had discernable kick. But I found it to be WAY too greasy. I mean, it was glistening. And not only that, but it just wasn't as seasoned as I would have liked. Instead, all the salty flavour could be found in the country biscuit, which was like eating dough, wrapped in butter, tossed in salt, wrapped in butter again, and then baked: IN BUTTER. They were pretty good actually.

My side of coleslaw was so-so. Wait, why am I still writing this review? Seacrest OUT.

{"text":"They got my order incorrect I ordered smokehouse boneless wings and instead received mild chicken tenders and they were SPOILED and when I returned them I told the manager with receipt in hand and made me fresh smokehouse boneless wings.  I tasted those and they were spoiled tasting as well. 

I am going to the local health department today to file a formal complaint because of this experience due to how many other consumers had this experience or children who can become ill due to food borne illness.

I also sent a email to Popeyes corporation so the district manager is made aware of this problem, cooking spoiled food and serving it to the public is a dire problem."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Popeyes chicken. In the drive thru they told us it would be an 8 minute wait which is expected, but in reality the wait was ~25 minutes.  When they brought out our food, I asked if there was ketchup in the bag and the server assured me there was all the condiments and utensils I would need (for my mash potatoes and rice). Upon arriving to my hotel with my 16pc meal, I discover there wasn't any utensils or plates. Also side note: Idk if it's this location specific or all of Vegas but there was NO MAC N CHEESE."}
{"text":"This marks the first time I've EVER given a five-star review to any form of chain restaurant, but it's well-warranted here.  I've visited this location four times since it opened, and even at the height of the \"NEW FOOD! EVERYBODY EAT THERE!\" furor, the staff was unfailingly polite and cheerful, the chicken was fresh and well-cooked, the biscuits were perfect and the dirty rice was great.  I've even tried the Cajun tenders, and unlike most places where any form of boneless chicken has as much seasoning as the box in which it is delivered, the tenders here have some real kick.  Make sure you get the \"mild\" ones for the kiddos.

I'm taking lunch to my son at school on Friday, and pondering picking up a big box o'bird to share with the teachers ..."}
{"text":"Ordered a 3 pc combo with an extra biscuit today, sat in the drive through waiting behind ONE car for 20 minutes, when I got up to the window I had to wait another 15 minutes before someone even came to the window and then another 10 after paying for my food. I had to wait out front an extra 5 minutes because they were out of biscuits, and inside I saw the manager slacking off and eating, she was there when I first went through the drive thru.
After the extremely long wait I was not apologized to.
Never again.
I made a yelp account just to leave this rating."}
{"text":"Best one out of the bunch. The chicken is not overlooked like the other ones in Vegas. I have a Popeyes closer to me but if I'm not starving I'll come to this one. They have a lot of of the same workers for the past few years which is always a plus. They usually have enough chicken on hand to fill your order even when it's a car line of 5+. 

If you are from New Orleans this tastes the closest in my opinion"}
{"text":"This location is in the \"ghetto\" adjacent to Texaco gas station on the corner of Maryland Pkwy & Tropicana . But it doesn't bother me whatsoever. I don't eat fried chicken at all ( yes I'm Black lmao ) but they have other things I enjoy here. The sides, and biscuits are my personal favorite . Due to me working out and gaining mass during the winter months, I tend to eat starchy type foods. Rice, beans, okra, potatoes etc.etc. I typically eat healthy and lean throughout the year. But as I said before... it's  bulking season.

 So back to my review... Employees were nice. I ordered 2 biscuits and a side of rice and beans. The food was fine, nothing different from any other location. I read a few of the reviews from others, and I just think people are just going on and on about the location. Probably just scared to come here, but if you're such a sacredy cat go through the driv thru chump. I went inside myself because that's just how I roll!"}
{"text":"Actually pretty expensive for what you get. The chicken was crispy and juicy however had no flavor complete lack of seasoning. Biscuits were literally hard like a hockey puck. The mashed potatoes had such a small amount of gravy it was almost a joke. Not worth it. Go find yourself a KFC."}
{"text":"If I could rank a place zero, this place would warrant it.
Went in on a Tuesday night. Ordered a combo # 6 (3 chicken fingers), plus rice/beans and a biscuit. My friend  ordered butterfly shrimp, with coleslaw and biscuit. Order came to just over $19. Paid.
A minute later we were told they had no butterfly shrimp, but they could provide hush puppy shrimp instead. Wasn't given the price difference back, although it was $1. 
When our order arrived, I was given a 3 piece dinner, not chicken fingers. Went back up to the counter, explained I was given the wrong order. A female employee looked at the order on the register, pointed out to the staff that he rang it in incorrectly (as a more expensive meal) then gave me the correct order. Didn't give me back the price difference...which was also $1. 
Got back to my seat...noticed we weren't given forks for the sides (I had rice/beans and my friend had coleslaw). Back up to the counter again for forks.
Friend who ordered the shrimp noticed he needed more cocktail sauce...went to the counter only to be told that they had run out...but they offered him tartar sauce instead, for shrimp. 
So, I was overcharged on 2 items, they didn't have an advertised food item in stock, not given forks, then they claimed to have run out of cocktail sauce for their shrimp.
Never again will I step place in this location."}
{"text":"So, in order to counter the bad review of KFC I did - I'd like to thank Popeye's for being right down the street from the office. The staff here is ALWAYS good, even the drive thru. And it's always quick, unlike the toher chicken place up the street.

My standard order? 

Number 5 = 5 Piece strips (spicy) with biscuit and Red Beans & Rice. Root Beer to drink.

The only thing that could make it better would be Vernors in the soda machine..."}
{"text":"As far as fast food type restaurants go...Popeye's is reasonably good.

I usually order the spicy chicken fingers combo (3 pieces of \"spicy\" chicken fingers, Cajun fries, biscuit and a pop). The \"spicy\" fingers are NOT spicy...they need to be heated up by adding their hot sauce or their buffalo sauce. Cajun fries are excellent (I've also tried their rice....ugh...just awful) and the biscuit, while fresh and warm, is very salty.

A friend (who's been here on several occasions) refers to this restaurant chain as \"the colon cleanse\" place....you do the math...."}
{"text":"I was in the area and needed a fast food option, as time was right.
Popped in on a Friday afternoon at around 1:30. 
Staff were friendly and efficient. Ordered my food and was advised that the wait time would be around 7 minutes....which is standard for other Popeyes I've been to.
Food was what I expected...it's a fast food place so food standards are consistent at every location.
Restaurant was clean...no overflowing garbage cans.
I'd go back if in the area."}
{"text":"Just left got home from this location. I'm pissed off! This is my 3rd time at this location and I know its a chain restaurant  but this is absolutely the worst location. I stopped by because it's near my home and even though I ordered the food to go, I decided to not go through the drive thru because I wanted to make sure my order was good. I ordered 35 dollars worth of food and asked that my tenders were fresh as I could see a huge pile already sitting there. The gal said ig would take extra time, which i was ok with. I waited and waited which is fine if the food is fresh, after 12 minutes or so I get my stuff fries were cold which the corrected. All this was at 4:30 pm but my tenders tasted and could tell the had been sitting for what looks like the lunch rush.  Thanks for stealing 35 bucks out of my pocket becsuse the food was trash.  So here I am wasting more time from a review I as you can tell never do."}
{"text":"After reading these reviews I did not have very high hopes at all but I was curious to try it. I walked in side and all tables we're taken and the line was long (I came in around 12:45). The line took less than 5 minutes and as soon as I put the ice in my cup, my food was ready. This was one of the best fast food experiences I've ever had and a great first impression from Popeyes."}
{"text":"Unsanitary. Unprofessional. Cold food. Five piece chicken missing two pieces. Shrimp and fish meal missing the fish and the shrimp was cold. Mash potatoes were cold. Worst Popeyes ever."}
{"text":"The coleslaw tasted like it had chemicals in it, it was horrible! I love popeyes, but this experience was not a good one."}
{"text":"Great food but seriously bad employees, rude and disorganized, so many times my Order has been wrong , it does seem to be getting better."}
{"text":"This is the worst Popeye's in Vegas. Even when there is no line, it takes forever to order, then receive the food. I've complained to customer service so many times, and nothing changes. Employees are disorganized and slow. They always forget something in the order. One of them is always checking her cell phone."}
{"text":"Way too many teenagers working here. All the foul language and horsing around was so disrespectful. The fact that one manager was in back with them doing the same and one manager the filthy lobby just watching it all happen. The floors were so dirty, tables were not clean and not one person in the lobby cleaning. Pure disgusting!!!!"}
{"text":"I asked for all white after I had placed my order the young lady assured me she would pack my meal. Of course she did not. And I ended up with a one breast and all dark meat. The floor needed to be swept fries and chicken bones on the floor.  Went to the restroom the toilet was dirty snd the paper towels didnt work either.  I think this was my last time at your restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever here. For a new place that just opened you would think they would've been more organized. 

When we pulled up to the drive thru I wasn't sure what I wanted so I told the guy to give us a minute. He then must've asked me five or six times what I wanted to order. Didn't I just say to give us a minute? So here is our exact order. 2 orders of the two piece dinner meal. One order with cole slaw and an extra side of Mac and cheese. Also wanted both of them to be legs. Both of them must be mild.  

We pulled up to the window to pay and get our order. Didn't even get a thank you. When we got home the order was completely wrong. I didn't get two legs like I specified, they forgot my Mac and cheese, and our chicken was spicy. After 5-6 phone calls to the number that was on the receipt, and someone actually answering, they told us that they have new staff. They are only getting two stars from me because they would give us the same order for free. Note to staff, maybe you should check the order before actually giving it to your customer."}
{"text":"Where do I start?  

If there's any review you ACTUALLY read, let it be this one! 

ONLY reason I came here the few times I did was because it is on my way home!  This place is HORRIBLE! Never again. The PEOPLE. The food, inside the building looks dirty!  They talk to each other more than anything, do not even bother to say hello to anyone coming in, the person at drive thru talks like it is our fault they works at Popeyes, always sound so irritated. 

The food here, is always cold, old and obviously sits there for a while. They have conversations in front of customers that should not be happening at the moment. My boyfriend came in here one time and actually argued with the cashier about his food being cold and she argued back like no it wasn't. She ended up saying the cops will be called, so guess what?  My boyfriend called the cops himself and they told him they do not respond to restaurant complaints, OBVIOUSLY. 

So the manager came out and asked What's wrong, my boyfriend explained. He looked at the cashier & asked her why didn't she just give him some new fresh food? Same thing he was wondering. 

It's HORRIBLE SERVICE, FOOD & A business horribly ran. It's worth it to drive to the next nearest one because this one is not worth a cent!"}
{"text":"I love their  fried chicken.  When it's right it's juicy, crispy and full of flavor.  Everything was great.  My Cajun mashed potatoes were hot and the biscuit was still warm.  My only complaint was it did take a while to get the food through the drive thru, but she apologized for the wait and I was satisfied with that.  Other than that this location was great."}
{"text":"Since the drive thru line was long, I decided to go inside to place my order. As soon as I entered it was clear that it was not busy at all. The cashier acknowledged us and said she would be with us in a minute so I said no problem. I ended up waiting for about almost 10 minutes. I would've walked out and taken my business elsewhere, but I figured I'd give them a shot. I ordered the family meal and after placing my order, and returning home I was disappointed that their chicken was very dry and some of the pieces were very small. Ridiculous. Poor customer service, cashier didn't even apologize for the long wait and the chicken was old and too small. I'd recommend going to a different Popeyes location."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews (which is why virtually all of my reviews are 4+), but this location is quite disappointing. The last 4 times I've ordered from there over the past few months, they've given me undercooked (read: pink, with very soggy skin and a chewy texture). I had strips too and when I tried to break it in half, all that happened was the breading slid off.

I'm not going to go there just to have to spend time in line, bring it home, take a bite, throw it out and hope I'm okay over the next few hours. It's a shame because I really like Popeyes."}
{"text":"It's great chicken but a bit pricey. I think it's $12 for the 8 piece mixed box of chicken, not the meal. That would probably satisfy 1-2 hungry adults. 

I've also had the 5-piece chicken tenders and was not filled up at all. They have seafood on their menu, but I haven't tried it."}
{"text":"Orders got delayed... waited for 20 minutes and had to ask the server twice to get the food, not to mention the nasty attitudes we got.... if only the service was as good as the chicken :-/"}
{"text":"Fast service.. had a few turnovers of management/owners. Getting better. Great food! Place is clean"}
{"text":"Don't go just before they close. I ordered the surf and turf combo 30 minutes before close on a friday night. Before I pulled up to the window to pay they literally had my bag hanging outside the window for me to see.

I didn't mind and didn't expect them to cook per order so I paid them and came home. I open up the bag and I'm missing half my order. They only gave me two chicken strips, and two sides. Never going back again."}
{"text":"So mad, I came in and ordered a 3 piece combo to go, and after waiting for a REALLY long time, got home and found 3 wings for my 3 pieces. That's ridiculous"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and food was good, but items that were paid for were missing from order."}
{"text":"Popeyes website says this location is open until 11. I drove in tonight at 10:05, the store is lit up, the sign and drive thru boards are lit up, people in the store but guy at the drive-thru tells me they're only open till 11 on Friday and Saturday.  Accurate info on your company website would be very helpful!"}
{"text":"After reading the questionable body language of the two Reps at the front that took and served my order, I don't trust or feel comfortable eating or receiving food from this restaurant (this particular location)."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst run Popeyes  in NC. Just went to pick up something for lunch.  I  placed my order at exactly 12:15 pm.  Guess what time I got my food ? 12:43 !!! Almost 30 mins for 2 2pcs dinners...Unbelievable  !!!. What chicken restaurant doesn't have chicken ready at LUNCH TIME ? The manager didn't offer an apology, money back or anything.  The cashier did apologize,  but the manager should have stepped up and said something.  With all that being said. To top this saga off, they got one of the orders wrong..I refused to take back because didn't have another 30 to waste.."}
{"text":"Food is great, customer service is ALWAYS trash. Don't expect to get good customer service when you come. :)"}
{"text":"I just wanted a chicken wrap with ranch.

When I visited Popeye's tonight, my sister and I went through the drive-thru. While we were at the speaker, we asked about what was in their chicken wrap. We asked a few questions (if there was lettuce and ranch in it, how big the wrap was), but the ladies couldn't hear us and asked us to finish our order at the window. Eventually, we decided on 2 chicken wraps. While cashing up our order, one of the ladies started talking in Spanish to the cashier. Fortunately for me, my sister understood everything. They called us spoiled, complicated, and picky. Just for asking about the products you were trained to sell? So unprofessional and plain rude! Haha, and to finish it off, she put one packet of ranch in our to-go bag for two wraps. Very poor customer service.

About the food.. The chicken in the wraps were good. Flavorful like I hoped. The wrap itself was sooo plain. The ladies never told us they put rice and beans in the wrap when we clearly asked what was in it. Obviously ranch would be terrible in this kind of wrap.

I don't like writing these kinds of reviews. I love Popeye's, but I will definitely not be returning to this particular store."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!

This was my second time to have Popeyes Chicken. The first time was about 2 years ago, while they had promotion. The chicken skin was unbelievable hard. I can say it was not  chewed or it would hurt my mouth. I dump my order at the end.  I wondered why the store provide this kind of food in promotion period. No longer, that store closed. I gave myself an excuse maybe that was an exception case, the store provided under standard food.

Today, I tried this newer open store in Mississauga, I ordered from the menu say \"10 WINGS ONLY\". While took to home,  Surprisingly, it was 4 wings + 5  legs!!! Why 5 legs, but not all wings?? why ONLY 9 pieces????

None of them had good experience. I really hate dishonest business. I won't go Popeye anymore."}
{"text":"What to try?

Their fried chicken and their tea biscuit!

Personally I like their fried chicken over KFCs because of the flavor and the crispness of the chicken. I like the batter Popeyes's use too. We ordered takeout because we weren't feeling like cooking. Their chicken is slightly more expensive than KFCs but because of their batter and the tea biscuits, I chose Popeyes. 

I don't know how Popeyes compare with other chicken chains like Mary Browns, but for the convenience and the swiftness of the service, I picked Popeyes for dinner. 

We ordered 13 piece chicken combo. Comes with a 2L pop, four pies, a box of tea biscuits, mash potato and coleslaw. Boy, was this meal filling. 

I liked the pie offerings. Not only did they offer the apple pie but offer a raspberry cheese pie. I also liked how they added brown sugar on top of the pie for an extra touch of tastiness. 

Last tip?

Try the chicken with some ketchup and hot sauce mixed together. You might like that extra kick of a dip to the chicken! Biscuits taste best when it's fresh and hot. If it gets cold, heat it up in the microwave for a couple seconds or oven for a couple minutes. Always ask the shop if they have any promotions going on, even asking if  paying by cash might get you anything, might score you an extra chicken piece! Don't forget about their daily deals. Everyday is a different deal offer that's under $4!"}
{"text":"I love Popeyes but unfortunately the customer service lacks in mostly all of them. I was not even greeted coming into this location. Apparently the manager is in the back yelling at most of his employees. Maybe that's why all the employees seem upset and stressed out. 
These issues should be addressed with employees when there are no customers hearing and seeing what's going on"}
{"text":"I come in here for lunch once a week. Jennifer, the manager, always remembers my name.

Every time I go in, I'm greeted upon entering and if there's a wait for my food, they're sure to let me know."}
{"text":"Came here for our first time but was not overly impressed  had the 8 pc. Chicken tender basket ,Tenders were piping hot but the Cajun fries were almost cold. Servers seemed poorly trained and slightly confused.
What really turned us off was the number of flys buzzing around the dining area , when mentioning it to a staff member was told off handily ya' we had the back door open.
Just disappointed in a relatively new restaurant that supposedly has the best fast food chicken in town!!"}
{"text":"Chicken was good but this particular Popeye's is very dirty and seems very inefficient. Also, I was there for the first time with my two grandsons. They were taught at a young age that sugary drinks were not healthy. Popeye's has no bottled water, no orange or apple juice, no milk!! What was I supposed to have them drink? You are not helping this country with our obesity problem in children. I don't think I will take them to Popeye's again."}
{"text":"I like Popeyes. However, I've had so many negative experiences at the location on Boulder Highway that I haven't been in quite awhile.

We definitely prefer their chicken to KFC's, but the prices usually seem so much higher and our order was always screwed up (at the other location). Well, we finally decided to check out the new location, which is on Stephanie St. at the front of the Winco plaza.

The drive thru is very strange. It's not really blocked off, so when we pulled up to order, there were 2 cars that pulled up NEXT to us (I guess to look at the menu?). It was just weird.  Also, there was super loud music blaring outside the restaurant, which made it hard to hear the order taker.   Anyhow, the menu at this location seems different than others I've been to.  It seems much smaller, with less options.  Not a big deal - I always order the same thing.

What I was excited to see is that they had a current offer for something called a \"Bonafide Big Box,\" you could choose between either 3 tenders or Mixed 2 pieces of chicken, along with 2 sides and a biscuit for $5.  This is a great deal - compared to almost $7 on the menu for the 3 piece tender combo with only 1 side (and a drink).

I ordered the tender bonafide box thingy (spicy, of course) with mashed potatoes and cajun fries.  My Mom ordered the 8 piece family meal with red beans and rice for everyone else to share.

The service was super friendly and fast, and the food was delicious.  There was a short delay at the pick up window (nothing major) and they were very apologetic.  When we got home, I noticed that we got extra chicken - I had an extra tender in my meal and the 8 piece meal was more like 11 pieces.  Maybe they threw it in for our wait? Whatever it was, we appreciated it!

This is a major upgrade over the other location and it's much closer to home.  I am sure we will be back.  Although, it would be awesome if they offered some of the same specials that other locations have - I am not sure why those are unavailable."}
{"text":"It is what it is. (I hate when people use that expression, but whatever, it works)

I don't go to Popeye's drive-thru expecting 5 star service. Or 1 star service for that matter.  It's fast food, I assume the employees are paid minimum wage and aren't particularly excited to be assisting anyone.  But daaaaaamn can this place make some chicken.  It doesn't come even slightly close to the amazing chicken I just had in Memphis, but for fast food, it's the best in town.

Stop complaining about the location, people.  If you think this is a bad area, I fear for you guys.  Boulder Highway gets a bad rap in general, but you have to head another direction for any trouble.  In my opinion.  I live further South on the highway (on the way towards Boulder City), and I've never had any issues.  In fact, I love the area.

Anywho....my only gripe about this location is that they seem to ALWAYS screw up my order (oddly enough, they didn't this trip).  It is also pretty far out of the way - not exactly convenient, so I don't go here often.  It is really frustrating to get home and find out they forgot something in your order, because there is no way I'm going back, and just wasted $$.  They probably do that on purpose.

The chicken is delicious.  But in my opinion, it's the sides that set them apart from any other chicken location.  The red beans and rice are a must have.  I LOVE the spicy gravy on the mashed potatoes, and the cajun fries are absolutely amazing.  I like to order the spicy chicken fingers and dip them in the mashed taters instead of a dipping sauce (like a true fat kid).  The biscuits aren't great, but they are pretty good when smothered in red beans and rice!

The prices are a bit outrageous, definitely more than other fast food places.  It's like $14.99 for an 8 piece family meal with 1 side and biscuits.  C'MON! Really?  Pretty ridiculous, but as I said, the chicken is delicious, crispy and spicy.

Not someplace I tend to frequent, but on occasion, it's a good stop."}
{"text":"Got home after picking up food. Order is completely wrong. Waste of time go to a different location."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru and ordered 2 of the 11 piece chicken special.. Was told to please park and they would bring it to me...Did not mind because it was a large order .. Patiently waited for 22 minutes until I finally got out of my car to check on my order... There was my chicken just sitting on the counter in a bag .. The employee just looks at me and points to my food .. Of course I had to go through it and as usual, they forgot the biscuits !!!! Went back in, no apology !!! Good chicken , horrible customer service!!!"}
{"text":"It's really a shame because this Popeyes had so much potential...when it first opened their was a full energetic staff now total opposite ... we ordered mild and spicy chicken , was told 15 minutes for mild ... not sure why a store that only sells chicken would not have our ready , especially during dinner hours .. the store was empty , we were the only guest at that moment .. we sat down and waited 13 minutes for our food, and that was the chicken that was ready!!!! Within the 30 mins we were there several guests came through the drive thru and counter service and were told the same about no mild chicken .. by reading all the negative reviews it seems to be a management problem.. either a new staff needs to be hired or the current employees need major training ...this store will not last much longer if no effort is made ..."}
{"text":"Ok, this is the second time giving the infamous Popeyes Louisiana style seasoning a try and all I can sat is \"disappointing\". I am not a big spicy buff, but this has got to be the most hidden spice in the world. I ordered the blackened seasoned tenders and everywhere else the blackened seasoning is certainly a noticeable taste. I could not even taste pepper. They must want you to imagine they added it to the batter or something. 

KFC still remains in first place on my list with Chester' Chicken in second. I am seriously debating on whether Popeyes even make my top 5.  

I gave 3 stars for service, they were nice and the service fast.  

Two times disappointed,  and I will have to go with Burger King at this location.  

Popeyes, you touted Louisiana goodness and seasoning, let's actually put enough in the batter to taste."}
{"text":"Worse location I have ever been to dry overcooked chicken, biscuits hard as a rock and even my drink was bad warm with a few ice cubes. 

I arrived at this location at 10:25 they claimed they were closing soon and had a limited menu and couldn't cook any more chicken so they had to verify if they had what I wanted which they didn't had to settle for the dry overcooked chicken strips mashed potatoes we're thrown into the bag sideways and the top came off and made a mess. The location is open until 11 not 1025 and refusing to do your job and cook is just unacceptable I will never stop by here next time I'm in Las Vegas and either should anyone else reading this."}
{"text":"As ghetto as you'd expect given its location, but they are generally pretty reliable and they seem to have their shit together.  I go here a lot... too much... and so I can say the service is pretty consistent.  Yes, sometimes there are long waits, service varies, but I've never been made to wait too long.  Besides, if they get hit with a burst of customers and run out of chicken, it does take time for the next batch unless you want salmonella poisoning instead of just waiting for the food to be cooked right.  The only time this happened and I had to wait, they didn't upcharge me for the second breast for my inconvenience.  Usually they charge a dollar extra. Occasionally the lady in the drive thru window (I never eat inside here) will even be friendly... though apathetic is fine, as long as my shit is right."}
{"text":"4 PC's combo for $9.99 plus tax.  Is good deal.  The chicken is not oily and have right taste. 
The chicken just coming out from fryer."}
{"text":"This Popeyes is a shit show, plain and simple. I'm giving it three stars because I love the food and the manager Charles is a super sweetie but other than that, the service is terrible. I came in and took me at least ten minutes to be helped and I can see clear into the kitchen so I know they're not understaffed. There were people just standing around and one guy kept walking past me smiling but not helping me. I know that the drive through line is priority but all your customers deserve a certain level of attentiveness. It's pretty much the same deal as last time, they're consistently messing up orders and I can hear the customers complaining and it makes the workers that actually are workers frantic. Last time we were here (last week) and they messed up our order.  I got the wrong side snd didn't receive the pie I order in turn I ended up getting an extra side and extra pies! I actually talked to the manager Charles and told him I appreciate how hard he's working because you can see he's the hardest worker there. Today we came back and we didn't receive our dipping sauce or our extra biscuit and were charged for an extra drink we didn't order. When I asked for sauce they were so stingy, I don't mind paying but they had already charged us .20 per sauce we didn't even receive and then only tried to give me one. Annoying. There's a Popeyes by my job in Mesa and I think we'll just be going that one from now on. Hopefully they hire some new staff that actually care about their job/serving their customers correctly."}
{"text":"This location is about average. The cashiers act like they hate their job. I can see why though. I drive to another location where they are friendlier."}
{"text":"Waited over 25 minutes in the drive through. Every car would pull up to the window and wait 7-8 minutes. What they heck are they doing in there?  How long does it take to put already cooked chicken in a box?  Wow."}
{"text":"First time I ever went to this location they left out one of 3 of my large sides.  

Ok now I go the other night it's 10:15 fryers are off ... no fries.  They only have mild chicken but three spicy ones. 


First off no one, no customer should be expected to buy what you have Left Over. 
Why are these workers so lazy? 

Why are fryers cut off an hour before you close ? 

Why do you keep insisting you have great workers but they are like mediocre at best. 

I'm sick of you fast food places poppin up and giving zero customer service because you either treat your employees poorly or you're hiring crappy employees. 

Either way, if you're closed at 11 how about cutting fryers off at what 10:45. Like who the hell wants your old heat lamp chicken left out. 

You are serving people food. That has a certain standard. I'm calling the health department because you're probably serving up bad chicken

Mind you I work as an environmental consulting so I do fortè in Bacteria and temperatures of food and the relations of."}
{"text":"Popeye's is Popeye's. No matter where it is, Cali or Illinois, it will taste the same. Drive thru service is okay. Most of the time i have to make it a point to tell them to get me MORE honey AND hot sauce. If I did not emphasize on the word MORE and AND enough, i will either get 1-2 honey packets and 1 hot sauce or 1 honey n no hot sauce or nothing at all. One time i asked for both and the staff told me that it's already in there. Came home and there's not a single honey OR hot sauce. If i could rate this place based on their service, I would give them a 2. But luckily, i still love Popeye's chicken."}
{"text":"A five piece strips dinner should contain FIVE strips, not four. Sadly, today was not the first time this has happened to me. Plus the four strips I did receive were cold and tasted like they had been sitting there for a while. Yuck. Get it together, Popeye's!"}
{"text":"I need say I write this a bit upset. Last night I ordered four dinner meals. After paying and returning home, two dinners were missing. This evening I returned making a complaint with the manager. I was asked two questions. Did you call and report missing dinners last night? Do you have your receipt? No I didn't call last night, that would be about nine hours prior. No I don't have my receipt but I can show you the draw down from my back account. This was the second time my order was short. The money, 23.00 is hardly pocket change. I just don't like to be ripped off. Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"First gave me the wrong order. Came back and got undercooked chicken and maybe 10 fries."}
{"text":"Efficient service.  

But DONOT BUY WATER HERE. $4 !!!  For the smallest bottle Get it from somewhere else."}
{"text":"SSSSLLLLOOOOOOWWW Service! I have not even gotten to the food and I'm unhappy. The lobby is clean enough to be tolerable, but not serviced recently."}
{"text":"Love Popeyes which they had more in the Phoenix area ! This area seem to do pre closing which some customers would think your closed."}
{"text":"I receiver cold food and a lemonade with no Ice my fish was over cooked and I asked for rice and beans not fries. When I approved the store there was three cars waiting but by the time I got to the front everyone was gone I told the lady Wow that was fast which is nice I except fast service but not cold and nasty food! I spent my last money on this food I can't eat I never asked for fries which are stale and cold and fish wasn't cooked correctly I'll be back to get my food replace or refunded I couldn't eat the bill shit it's sitting on my table till I get off work tomorrow I have to go to bed hungry tonight cause this location chose to be LAZY ! I'm HIGHLY UPSET"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru, and service was okay. Food was COLD, ask the guy to make fresh food, took 15 minutes and he brought it to me. French fries were still cold. Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"When I go to any Popeyes I only order two items. Spicy chicken and a large red beans and rice. No matter what Popeyes I go to they are ALWAYS out of one of those items. Today this particular Popeyes is out of both spicy chicken and red beans and rice. If I was the district manager I would fire all of the Las Vegas Popeyes managers."}
{"text":"Chicken was fresh, hot & spicy.  Red beans & rice and mashed potatoes with Cajun gravy are great.  I ordered the crawfish box with horseradish sauce - very good! Drive thru service was fast, efficient & polite.  I wasn't missing anything.  Always a good experience when I come here."}
{"text":"They took over 35 minutes to give our take out order not correct and they are under under staff horrendous"}
{"text":"I love the food the breading on the chicken is absolutely perfect it's so addicting I go there about twice a week. (no joke I'm like good friends with the manager ) I order an 8 piece chicken tender meal w/ a root beer and no sauce and that's just for myself. That's how good it is! (Lol)"}
{"text":"I understand that, when large orders come in, sometimes Popeyes can run out of chicken and have to fry up more. However, I've been waiting 20+ minutes in a parking space for a Po Boy that consists of about two chicken tenders and two small sides. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Racist remarks at its finest

Bad management, waited at the window for the cashier to show up. Wait a good five minutes and was asked \"what did you order?\" I was offended when I heard through the window \"the chinks order didn't go through..\" well have a good day. Management for this company sure can't be civil like."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness if there was another Popeyes like there is McDonalds in this area I would be going to another location. This location is constantly messing up orders and takes FOREVER! Seriously as long as this place has been open they should already have their crap together but they don't!"}
{"text":"No chicken ready through the drive thru? I tried several options until I wound up getting shrimp.  Got it home and it was cold. Apparently not my day."}
{"text":"This is the worst Popeyes in Las Vegas. They ALWAYS get the order wrong. On a few occasions they have burned the chicken. I've been shorted on the amount of chicken given compared to the amount I paid for. I'm so sick of this location consistently messing up. I understand mistakes happen from time to time but their mistakes are very frequent, 90% of the time there is something wrong with my order. Stay away!!!!"}
{"text":"Finally a Popeyes in town. It's located in a small plaza right next to the Source.
We got take out a few times. Fast service and friendly staff. 
I love the Popeyes apple pies"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru last night for dinner. 
I got a 3 piece white meat meal with cole slaw, mashed potatoes, and sweet tea. 
I decided to try the spicy white meat chicken!  Apparently that means one breast and two wings :?I think next time I'll ask for dark meat...seems like you'd get more chicken that way.  Pretty darn tasty and fresh!"}
{"text":"The manager at this store her name is \"Alma\" she is very rude and does not deserve to be a manager for any business! She ia the manager/cashier. She argued with me about what I ordered when I know I was correct and even the corporate office agreed with me. She then continued to argue with me about it at the window and then she shoved the food in my car very rudely and told me to go. And guess what....after arguing with me about what I ordered she still managed to give me the wrong order lol how does that happen? She threatened to call the cops because I wouldn't leave due to her not giving me the order I asked for on top of not even giving me the order she told me I asked for lol. Her coworkers were in the back laughing like children I would not trust to eat at this location at all as the food is very underwhelming , the co-workers are like children and shouldn't be trusted with food and the location is managed by a narcissist manager/cashier ! If you come across the manager/cashier \"ALMA\" who on the receipt goes by the name \"Order Taker\" then please give her a smile as she obviously needs more love in her life and less hate and rudeness!"}
{"text":"Please take your business elsewhere. The 1 star reviews are no joke. My husband went to Popeyes to get dinner for the family, and $45 later (yes $45 for crap fast food) he gets home and there were no biscuits. The female employee who was taking his order argued with my husband on the order. Hubby asked for 6 tenders spicy and 10 regular. She kept saying that Half and Half. Um no. It's not. Finally my husband was like \"whatever, just get my food\". 

So back to no biscuits....  I decided to drive the 10min back to the store, on Rainbow in evening traffic to get some damn biscuits. I was greeted by a young man. Seemed pleasant and friendly. I told him my husband got home with no biscuits and my family is currently eating without me. He walked away. Another young man gets my biscuits and then asks \"is there anything else?\"  How about an apology? How about a credit or perhaps some extra chicken? Geez. Just get me home already. So 30min for everything I get home and the family is done eating and the food is cold. 

I immediately wrote a complaint on Popeyes website, and received a call about 20min later. I was on another call dealing with a family emergency so I ignored it. No voicemail. No attempt to call me again. Nothing. I googled the number to see that it came from Popeyes. So I called it back. I was handed off to the \"general manager\". She was very nice. She apologized profusely. Which I appreciated. She then said she would give me 2 two piece meals free. Just mention her name to whatever manager is working. Um...why not just mail me some coupons? So I would have to go speak to a manager again just to get two little meals? I could've taken my kids to Cicis for half the price or Sweet Tomatoes for $15 less than I was charged at Popeyes and they would've like the food better. 

Just avoid this place. The food isn't so good that the service can be ignored."}
{"text":"Rude service, poor language skills
She gave me attitude when I didn't want 2 drumstick 
Honey missing from biscuit 
Food was good tho
Nice coleslaw"}
{"text":"Meh!!! Out running errands so we spotted the Popeye's. Food that you haven't had in a LONG time is usually good...or not. This fine establishment is connected to Fills mini-market. We ordered a 8-pc meal. Because they didn't have enough \"spicy\" chicken, they asked if we wanted 6 pieces now and wait for another batch that would be ready in 5 minutes. We thought...5 minutes...let's get all 8 pieces fresh. WRONG!!! So many appendages in my chicken. Ew...The batter was crumbly, in a bad way and the chicken was super dry, like beef jerky. The coleslaw didn't have that freshly made look. Mushy. Didn't even wanna eat the biscuit. Blech. Feeling gross now!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why the hype for this chicken?! I decided to give it a try since I was shopping next door. Went through the drive thru and while the service was fast the price for a two piece meal was over $7. I'll admit the chicken was moist but could use a bit more flavor. I am not a fan of the gravy on the mashed potato but the biscuit...well I could've eaten a dozen of those. Sad to say that there are way too many places to eat in the area so I won't be back."}
{"text":"hubby had a craving and a coupon.  He waited over 30 minutes for his chicken at 8:30 at night!  Counter person acted and performed as if being there and doing her job was a near death experience and was very rude to my husband and no apology was made for the needless wait.  Unit was dirty too.
Shame on the manager for letting these hires stay on staff and not seeing that what is his responsibility to keep this place running is almost literally in the toilet"}
{"text":"I enjoyed going to this location. The restaurant is very clean. It looks like it was newly renovated - I only say that because the restroom signs look old. 

Even though the cashier was a bit impatient with me, I still thought service was overall good. I got my order in a timely fashion and everything was correct. I'm a little upset that the cashier was impatient because it was my first time ordering at Popeye's, so I didn't know what I wanted immediately, nor did I know the options! My bad.

The chicken was good and fried well. The mac & cheese was as good as it was gonna get. I liked the cajun fries a lot. They had a special - $5 for 3 tenders and two sides and a biscuit. I am still very full from lunch and it is dinner time."}
{"text":"Rap music made me come here: \"outside of Popeyes eating chicken and fries\". Popeyes is the best fast-food fried chicken franchise out there."}
{"text":"This chain fried chicken place is fairly new and a bit more spacious than some other area Popeyes I've seen. They have a lineup of weekly specials starting at a decent price ... I never noticed if others have them too but I took advantage of the 3 pieces of chicken for $4.29 Thursday special. 

The food is consistent with other Popeyes and the staff are efficient and friendly. Plenty of nearby parking in a new retail plaza.

Another big plus in fast food chains is cleanliness and they come out on top here, Popeyes are generally really clean restaurants and this one is no different."}
{"text":"Ok, I know you're going to ask, \"how can you give fast food 4 stars?\"  Well, I'll tell you. While obviously his isn't fine dining, consider the competition.  Churches? KFC? Chick-fil-a?  Popeyes is the best of the gang.  If you want some deep fried goodness and only want to wait 30 seconds, this is where you should go. Everything here is actually pretty tastey and made of real food.  The chicken's good and the breading's crisp, which is a clear fail of the other choices most of the time.  Also, Louisiana sides are just better than Kentucky ones.  Lastly, you can get some pretty decent fried shrimp here too.  Can you do that at the other options?

I will say though, you never need as much grease as you think you do.  Order one size smaller than you're planning.  When you have a comfort food craving, head here, just remember that the first half is always way better than the second.  Not a knock on the food, just a fact of life."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!!!!  Why can't a fast food establishment teach good customer service or fire the holes that give them a bad rep.  I will never go back to this location!!!"}
{"text":"We got our food and it was cold so we asked them to remake it. The manager Christian never even looked to see what was in our box just said okay and turned around while turned away he said four minute. We waited about ten minutes and went to the front to see if it was done. When they handed us the food the meal we paid for wasn't complete it was missing all the side. Spoke to the manager again and he said we didn't ask for the sides to made over (All of the meal was cold so why would we only ask for the chicken) then he just turned around and continue to do whatever he was doing before hand. The manager was rude and didn't seem willing to help or serve quality food. I get its just a fast food place but that doesn't mean you can serve people cold food then get an attitude with a paying customer because you served them cold food"}
{"text":"Very inviting and clean, but once you get through the door is another story. you can hear employees screaming, the manager yelling at the employees in the back to put on their prep gloves with a nasty attitude. I got tenders with a side of fries and even though they were very busy my food was cold and tenders were pink in the inside . The Msgr. Was nice to me though, but I ran out of there and eat in the car."}
{"text":"Great food but I've been to this location about 5 times now and they have NEVER gotten my order correct. My husband usually checks before bringing it home and has them fix their mistakes right then and there. Tonight, he didn't check (he really shouldn't have to) but after getting home, we found a completely incorrect order. He is now on his way back now to fix what they messed up and I'm sure by the time he gets back with the correct parts of our order, the rest of the food we have here will be cold. It's a shame because I love their shrimp but hubby says we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Ever hear of a fried chicken fast food place running out of thighs on a Saturday early evening???
Me neither. 
I've been here twice to get thigh meals for myself and my family. We love chicken thighs. 
Both times I've gone through the drive thru, once on a Friday and once on a Saturday, NO THIGHS. 
I had to wait 15 minutes (more like 20)BOTH TIMES. 
I was never even given a coupon for a free meal or given anything extra for my order.
Sorry kids, \"sorry\" doesn't cut it.
You're a busy fried chicken place - you should NEVER be running out of chicken !!!! Ever!
No other Popeyes has this issue. The manager of this location is clearly slacking."}
{"text":"Late night dinner and they made everything fresh for us.  We waited 12 mins but totally worth it when feeding a hungry family of five!  Definitely one of the best Popeyes we've been to.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Recently, I have found new love for Popeyes. The food is simply delicious, tastes fresh, and in my opinion, doesn't feel like you're eating 'fast food'. Putting the icing on top, I've never had anything but outstanding service from the employees. Today, they forgot to put a spork in my bag for the mash potatoes (simple mistake, not a big deal!) so I waited until someone came back to the window, before I left to ask for one. The kind lady who came back to the window had a big smile, apologized, and even gave me an apple pie. I'm not one to take advantage of others or businesses, but even after refusing the apple pie, she said, \"oh no! I'm giving you the apple pie for having to wait! :)\" I wish I had asked this kind lady what her name was, but I completely spaced doing so. In a world where genuine customer service is becoming more rare, this was a really refreshing experience, and I would like give all the workers at this Popeyes a huge thumps-up!"}
{"text":"I sat at the drive through menu for over 15 min before they took my order. Horrible customer service. I could have gone to Red Lobster, ordered, and eaten before Popeyes even took my order. Straight BS."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst fast food place ever. I thought that since the last few times in the drive thru I didn't get all of my order that I'd actually go inside and order my food. They were not busy but looked short staffed and it also seemed like there was a trainee at the counter as she was making mistakes the manager was catching or correcting after orders were served. That should have been my first clue. I also *Should Have* looked at the amount of prepared chicken. As far as mild, they had none. They had no nuggets,  chicken strips either. Basically no mild anything. So, I finally get to order my food and get my receipt. It said 5:27 PM. 6pm rolls around and I see a box of chicken chilling on the counter for the last 10 minuets, thankfully it wasn't mine but someone got some cold chicken. About 6:15 PM and my food is finally ready. I said the the \"manager\" behind the counter that it has been 50 minutes since I paid for my food. He gives me a blank dumbfounded look, \"well, uh we had to wait for fresh food.\" No, they had no chicken before I paid for mine. They weren't doing their jobs. And as the \"manager\" he wasn't doing his. I told him it was \"Fast Food\" 50 minuets was unacceptable. His dumbfounded look and deer in the headlights act had the same response about fresh food. Look, I can go the the store and get it myself and fry it in less than 50 minuets. They dropped the ball. They aren't doing their job. He, the \"manager\", isn't doing his. He still just stood there looking dumb when I asked \"what would you have done if I was in the drive thru line?\" He said it would have been faster. How so? They had nothing to serve. I asked for his manager, and he said, \"I am the manager.\" No kid, Your manager. He said call the number on the receipt.

The \"manager\" could have attempted to offer something for the inconvenience, but no. Nothing. 

The next step is to call corporate. They should read their reviews of this store. Corporate also needs to step in and fix this place. Reading the other reviews I don't get how they're not constantly getting complaints from corporate. They all need retraining."}
{"text":"I read in the reviews that this restaurant gets the orders wrong so I checked my bag before I left and found that my order was indeed missing items. I had to argue with the cashier to make my order complete then found that there was no sauces or utensils and had to fight to get those as well. I thought I could get around the poor service but I just don't think it is worth the aggravation no matter how much I crave the food."}
{"text":"Horrible service, rude employees and tight servings....what more can you ask for :)  Stay away from this location.  Not sure why businesses go downhill once they open up in Canada."}
{"text":"Ate ate Popeye at many states, this is not it!
The spicy chicken is NOT spicy yet it contains more grease then chicken, purely inedible. no idea how they get away with it in a corporate environment."}
{"text":"Well, we revisited Popeye's on Stephanie for lunch just a few minutes ago. I don't know if it's the difference between night shift and day shift, but the experience couldn't have been smoother!  Yay!  Our order was taken right away, the guy was courteous, the order was accurate, heck - we even had ranch dressing!  We'll venture back again before we declare this place cured, but it's a step in the right direction."}
{"text":"In a hurry? Stop by and go through the drive up window and get your fast courteous face to face quick service and your done."}
{"text":"Food tastes like regular popeyes food.
I was dining in. The staff were sweeping the place. A staff member swept under the table I was eating at, ignoring that I was there, and even poked my feet with her broom. So ignorant. She then used the same broom she was sweeping the dirty floor with, and swept the benches that people sit on with it.
If someone from Popeyes reads this, I will not be going back to this store. I can only imagine how things are run in the kitchen where people can't see.
Gross."}
{"text":"Ran by a bunch of people who have absolutely no work ethic! I waited 15 minutes for nuggets!!! I complained and I got told \" we were busy making strips\" then they gave me Cajun nuggets which were supposed to be mild. The manager then have me attitude like it was my fault! Food was hot and tasty when we finally all got to eat."}
{"text":"Let me learn you a thing about this Popeye's.
Our first impression was coming up to a broken sign advertising their current deal and whatever the bottom deal was, it was illegible.  Once we got up the counter we were met with the cashier and what I believe to be a manager bickering and scowling at each other while customers waited in line.  While placing my order the cashier mumbled, still don't know exactly what she was saying, so I made guesses and tried to place my order.  She also cut me off before completing my order so I had to finish after she already completed the transaction.  I ordered spicy chicken tenders, mac'n cheese, buffalo sauce, and a strawberry pie.  She informed me that the spicy chicken would take about 3 minutes to make.  

*15 minutes later*

My group is standing to the side while the line built up to about 10 people while the staff continued to bicker at each other.  Once they finally produce a bag of chicken, the cashier mumbled what it was so 3 people (me included) approached her.  Apparently we had all ordered spicy chicken.  At this point the manager comes over at get rather abrupt with the 3 customers.  The initial order did not fulfill anyone's order so the manager threw mac'n cheese in the bag to meet one customers order.  Then she handed me my bag, after a quick review I notice there was no pie or sauce.  By the time I turned around the 3rd customer was instructing the manager on what he had ordered, apparently she had misplaced the order slip.  So I try to get anyone's attention, eventually I was able to get the initial cashier's attention... to which she ran into the manager and grabbed me a pie off the shelf.  

At this point my group and I were tired of spending time in the midst of the chaos so going back for my sauce was a lost cause.  The biscuit was also stale, which is the reason we went there in the first place.  I know Oakland, PA does not consist of the finest of eateries but this is by far the worst experience I have had so far."}
{"text":"This Popeye's is the WORST in town. The staff are rude, thoughtless and careless & customer service sucks. The management couldn't care less about the customers. 

The only reason we've gone back is because we have guests in town for the holidays; they love Popeye's but it's not available in their area. So we've eaten Popeye's 4 times in 11 days. There has been a problem with our order EVERY single time. Wrong side orders - how do you confuse red beans & rice with coleslaw? Wrong drinks. Worst of all, we always order the 12-piece family meal. Now, there should be 3 breasts, 3 wings, 3 legs & 3 thighs; everyone knows that. We never get that in our order. Strangely, there is always only ONE BREAST. 

My husband believes that the store is cheating the customers with cheaper pieces of meat instead of providing the expensive breasts, which are being turned into the 'boneless wings' which are clearly white meat. I think the staff is improperly trained & can't tell the difference between a breast & a thigh, because we generally get 4 of those or 3 or 4 legs or wings.

We've talked to staff, we've spoken to management we've expected the problems to be remedied - an extra side, replace the missing pieces of chicken, even a simple 'We're sorry', but we've gotten nothing. 

The food is delicious & we'll continue to buy it but we'll be driving the twenty minutes each way to go to the second closest Popeye's store to us."}
{"text":"For being a fast food restaurant, I was very impressed with this Popeyes location.  When placing our order, the staff were very friendly! When placing our order, they would ask if you wanted regular or spicy, etc.  Also, if they have a special, they will let you know that you can save $ to get the best deal. Ordered the shrimp basket w/fries, 8 pc. meal w/2 side orders & 4 biscuits.  Everything was hot & fresh! Didn't even have to ask for condiments; they knew exactly what should come with the meals!  Also, their ice tea is really good too!  Definitely would go back!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous...Everytime we have come here they can't get the order right ..we ordered 3 , 3 piece ckn tender combos .. we got 2 and a box with wings..my BF ordered mash potatoes with NO gravy .. we got home and there's gravy all over it .. I really think they need to either train there staff better or hire older more mature smarter people. We always have issues and will now drive the Xtra time to the Craig and Tenaya store....beware of the dummies working at this store.."}
{"text":"Restaurant review
After living here for 2.5 years I finally got to stop by popeyes. Up north we get coupon mailers every week for promotions, but I have never seen a coupon here ever. My wife was craving fried chicken so my bucket list in Champaign of trying out every restaurant/fast food has continued. This is located right next to the motels and McDonald in this area. I was surprised by the freshness of the chicken and also friendly staff. Even though they don't have coupons, there is a long list of manager specials and also special promotions. We paid 13.99 for a 10 piece mix and also 5 dollar for the shrimp tackle box which comes with shrimp, biscuit, side, and for 1 dollar more a drink. The chicken was super hot and crispy. Great flavors and fresh. They also have a self serve fountain machine for refills. The one major negative is that the floor was super slippery like the oil could not be cleaned out. This was so bad that I saw numerous people almost slip and fall. I can only imagine what would happen if someone were to slip and fall....

Pros: fresh fried chicken, manager specials, plenty of parking, easy to get to location

Cons: greasy floor to the point where you can slip and fall

Hidden deals:
Check the manager special board before ordering

Health code rating: C. Super dangerous and greasy floors. http://il.healthinspections.us/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=2002"}
{"text":"Checkin is a lie here. Dont do it. They don't honor the 20% yelp promo they offer for yelp checkin. Sucks that yelp does not hold businesses accountable, instead allow them to offer fake promos. Popeye staff and manager looked at me like i was crazy when i showed them their promo. Don't offer it if you're not going to honor it. I have a new found disappointment for yelp and popeyes."}
{"text":"The first time I had ever been to a Popeye's was in Dallas Fort Worth airport a few years ago!!!   I had an 8 hour layover on my flight to Paris.  I knew I had to try some southern comfort food and yes, it sure it the spot, I loved my lunch that day.  I still remember it cause I pigged out on fried chicken, mashed potatoes, biscuit, gravy, corn, and who knows what else lol ...  so, when I saw this Popeye's located at McCarran, I wanted to get something to eat for good ol' times sake ;)

I had just bought my sandwich at Jersey Mike's and definitely knew I wanted to sit down in this area to eat, so I planned on getting Cajun fries as a side!  but then I couldn't make up my mind, so I got both small french fries and a small mashed potatoes gravy :)  Well, what can I say, I love comfort foods and mashed potatoes are my #1 yummy in my tummy!  There is just something calming about creamy delicious mashed potatoes and for a fast food place, I would say in my opinion, Popeye's has one of the best you can get!!!  I love the flavor of the gravy too.  Plus they have good Louisiana hot sauce packets, I love spicy anytime!

The Cajun fries were great, went well with my Chipotle Steak sandwich.  The mashed potatoes hit the spot as usual, they were soooo yummy!  I believe I spent $3 or less on these two items and it was totally worth it, super cheap and tasty!  The staff working was friendly, my order came out less than a minute, right when I paid I got it!  I liked the area I was sitting in, so it was good to enjoy eating around 9am, and the tables around me where almost full.  I am glad I walked around the terminal first before I made my decisions on what to eat/drink, made a huge difference because I was more comfortable and could take my time!"}
{"text":"Went here last Tuesday for its Tuesday special. 2 pieces of chicken for 3.29 + tax. The chicken was not bad for its pricy, very crispy and juicy. I got 2 pieces of chicken and a fries for around $5. It filled me up."}
{"text":"Been to this Popeyes a couple of times. I only get this when it becomes desperate times and you feel those horrible junk food cravings. This is just a regular Popeyes, nothing special. The location is not bad and there is a lot of parking usually. The + is that place is clean and gives a lot of seating; I've never seen the place packed so that you can't sit. It does get a little busier on Tuesdays though. ;) (that Tuesday special is gooood)

I'm only giving it a lower rating because sometimes the employees are not the nicest and customer-orientated. It's aight, but I prefer not to visit to save my health.

3/5."}
{"text":"I find that this Popeye is a lot greasier than others in town. The fat just leaks off. I would recommend going to another Popeye. This chicken here is just disgusting."}
{"text":"Not good. Service was ok, but actual food delivery was a problem ... several items were out or unavailable, soda machine had issues, etc. The food itself was stale, tough, bland, or gritty, depending on what item it was. My expectations of fast food aren't all that high, but this was honestly terrible fast food. On top of that, most of the tables were dirty, half of the sporks (fortunately sealed in plastic) were covered in sauce, and the garbages were all overflowing."}
{"text":"Evening of MARCH 6, 2015
The previous reviews for this location are CORRECT! It's dirty, so don't plan on dining in. Which makes you wonder how clean it could be where the food is being made. Service is SLOW and orders are filled out of order, so a lot of frustrated people standing around. 

Not only is the customer service horrible (the biscuit Nazi kid was super rude while taking our order and would not allow a biscuit to be considered a side dish. Other locations don't have a problem with it) our basic order was wrong (ordered chicken strips, 2 out of 3 chicken strip orders came out with fried chicken with bones instead of strips and the biscuits were hard and cold). Unfortunately, they handled it like they didn't care and we did not want to wait for chicken strips to be made. We rarely grab fast food, and won't be returning to this place ever again."}
{"text":"Brand new place! Super good chicken! Opened very recently and they are open from 10am-10pm. The staff is very friendly and precise."}
{"text":"Ok this is the second time I have tried this Popeyes. The chicken was cold the popcorn shrimp was hard as a rock!!! Terrible  it's sad I love Popeyes. Unfortunately I have to go to the one on Bonanza. That is the only good Popeyes left"}
{"text":"Poor service at this location.

I made the mistake of coming here and getting chicken tenders. Echoing what the other reviewers have said, here's why you should avoid this location:

1. The employees are disgruntled teens. Total lack of customer service skills. They don't greet you properly, they don't smile, and look like they can't wait to get off their shift.

2. Small portions and not warm... Of the 3 pieces of chicken tenders, one of them is the size of a nugget, and ALL of them are lukewarm. Kind of tasted stale and makes you feel ripped off.

3. Homeless people come in asking for money. You feel scared not giving them something.

I've had good experiences at some other locations of Popeyes, but not here."}
{"text":"I don't know who owns this Popeyes but this is the worst Popeyes I've been to Las Vegas. They don't even do the Tuesday two piece special but every other Popeyes in town does. Fail Fail Fail !!!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why every single Popeyes in Las Vegas has horrible customer service. Where do they hire these people from well why don't they train them on how to have reliable responsible courteous customer service giving people the wrong order people waiting 25 to 30 minutes for one simple order is ridiculous. And on top of that forgetting people's orders all together"}
{"text":"Once again  this Popeyes fails again ... 20 minutes to get chicken in the drive through. You got to be f*cking kidding me. And why isn't  there a sign on the door saying  the lobby  is closed at 10. But the drive through  is open till 11. I wish I  could burn this place down to the ground. Problem solved."}
{"text":"This place is a JOKE! I have called Corporate 4 times now. We show up every Tuesday for the Tuesday special (which is now changed and not worth it anymore). Every Tuesday, they never have apple pies on a TUESDAY at 4pm! We have to go to McDonalds. Well, this Tuesday, we go through the drive through as usual, discovering the Tuesday Special has changed and is not worth it. We opt for an 8 piece instead, and requested all dark meat. The guy ACTUALLY TELLS ME he doesnt have it. Yeah. POPEYES didnt have DARK MEAT on a TUESDAY at 4pm. Oh yeah, and it would be a 7 minute wait on apple pies. We left. We rolled right out the drive through. I called Corporate, AGAIN. She actually had to go and doublecheck about my previous complaints to verify what I was saying before she would do anything, and all she did was say she was sorry and she'd forward the problems. I am NEVER coming back to Popeyes! You people make me ashamed to be from Louisiana!

Update: After reading all of these horrible reviews and the obvious fact that Popeyes doesnt seem to care, I encourage each and every one of you to call corporate: (877) 767-3937."}
{"text":"I shouldn't love it as much as I do.  But Popeye's makes me happy.  SO happy!  On a cold day - nothing better than some hot fried chicken and some mashed potatoes or mac 'n cheese.  I'm a big fan of the chicken strips personally - but they have some rockin' deals on multi-piece deals.  And their cajun shrimp are pretty dang good!  Better than you'd think from a drive through location!  

Their sides are really awesome - but the best side is the biscuit - which is why it gets second billing.  They taste so yummy and buttery you just KNOW they are absolutely no good for you.  And yet.... mmmmmmm... so good."}
{"text":"Absolutely zero customer service.  I was ignored for 5 minutes. I was finally acknowledged by the guy working in the drive through. The Asian guy working the counter just pretend that I want there. He glanced at me but pretend that I wasn't there. After 5 more minutes the Asian guy came over with a smirk, giggled and said welcome to Popeys how may I help you. I tell him I wasn't the 2 piece white combo. He says do you want it to be a combo? Because it is only chicken and a biscuit. Do want to make it a combo with a side and a drink. I replied yes I wasn't a combo. He said yeah, yeah. Then he started pushing buttons on the register, never asked me what side I wanted, so I ask him if I can have rec brands and rice as my side. He replied again with yeah yeah. I cancelled my order and left. 

To the owner of this Popeys, you should get active ibn your businesses and correct the problems, if not I hope you go out of business."}
{"text":"First let me say I know it's Tuesday, so staff for business levels!  The line is wrapped around almost to the gas station area, two registers, one open, and about 5 other employees.   Here is NO sense of urgency to get guests taken care of in a timely manner.  In fact I watched as one guest was called,  he didn't hear his number, called again, nothing, so it was set aside.  The guest came to he counter, gave his number, instead of reaching back and getting his order they made him wait another few minutes, why? Just give him the order!  Never again at this location,  service sucks, even on a regular day."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible management. I asked to change my order from just the 12 piece chicken to the 12 piece family meal when I pulled up to the window. 1) the drive thru was NOT busy at that time and 2) if a customer wants to get more food and pay more money, what is the problem? Too bad the manager had a problem with that and I could clearly hear her complaining very loudly in the kitchen as I was waiting calmly for my food. If that manager can't stay professional why the hell is she in that position? I tried to ask her why she had a problem with me changing my order but she was taking another drive thru order. I let the friendly team member helping me know to tell his unprofessional manager she might want to talk shit a little quieter, as I could hear every damn word. Had I had more time, I would've gotten my money back and left the food. Instead I rely on someone higher than this piss poor manager to see my review and change that girls attitude. Never going back. 0 stars if I could"}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru here. Got home...no apple pies. Checked my receipt and I did pay for them. I wasn't going to drive all the way back there to get them, but I tried to call to let them know they made this mistake. However, the phone line is connected to a fax machine so....I can't even call to complain. After reading the other reviews, I see this is a regular occurrence at this location.  Not to mention, they didn't have any white meat spicy chicken and only put one utensil in the bag, despite my having ordered two meals. SMH."}
{"text":"Popeye's in Charlotte, I can't tell you how happy I am. Of course it was great. Chicken is fantastic, fries are good and crunchy, but whatever they use to coat the chicken gives it an unbelievable flavor once it's fried. And VERY crispy!  JUst wait a bit as the police were directing traffic in the drive through because it is so new, popular and people have been WAITING for it to finally get to Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love Popeyes on a Tuesday!!! You get a leg and a thigh for 99 cents. How awesome is that?!?! Plus the Spicy Fried Chicken is pretty darn good. Every bite is full of flavor.

I have yet to try anything else on the menu, but I'll definitely will be back. 

Weird side notes: There are like 4 or 5 chicken places in this area and I have yet to give the other places a try because Popeyes is so cheap and tasty.  Also, if you have a hard time looking for this location, it is attached to a Fills."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. Lupe at the drive-thru has to have THEE worst customer service EVER. She didn't repeat the order, she charged my card, AND got it all wrong. She even felt the need to be rude and have an attitude about it.  Learn some manners and BASIC service skills Lupe."}
{"text":"This is a franchise we don't see often in this area.  So when one is found you are lucky to try it.  This time when I went here I was unlucky.  They didn't have any of the specials your see advertised on tv.  That was a first red flag.  The disorganized front counter and the dirty dining room was our second red flag.  And lastly the dirty, no soap and no paper towel bathroom was the third and final red flag!  How can a place operate when the place is a dirty mess?!  Trash on the floor, pop and water all over the drink counter...Apparently no staff member comes out to clean or do any thing there.  No mind you, we were there for probably an hour eating.  The food was ok... just under the level of Long John Silvers.  I will never go back to this location and always remember that a dirty dining room means the whole place is dirty.  Beware."}
{"text":"Finally, we found the best POPEYE'S located in Goodyear! We are sooo very happy and here's why...First of all, the place is very clean and just cute ! The employees are nicely dressed and very friendly ! The manager was on duty and helping the front end, in providing excellent service to the customers. (Which was very nice to see ) The food was soooo very good and we are just happy to have driven by, and see this location. (after the Cincinnati Red's Ball Game in Goodyear). This location of POPEYE'S should be training Center for the other locations in Litchfield Park on how to clean and dress (clean clothes)  and prepared good quality food to the Customers ! Just saying... SHAME on the owners, of those locations !"}
{"text":"Everywhere else throughout the country where I have went to Popeyes their jalapeño are complimentary why do you all charge for jalapeños?  Has to be the worst manager ever, must be new to the job, how is it people are waiting inside literally 25 minutes to get our orders."}
{"text":"So I've never been to Popeyes before, my cousin is always going to the one on baseline and is hooked. After seeing it so many times on her snapchat, I decided to give it a try. We prefer a #3 and four #5's, the price was reasonable. The lady says it'll be a 20 minute wait, so she parks us on the side. We wait 30minutes, and the chicken was fresh but isn't it common sense if your going to make me wait for chicken you should give me fresh frys and biscuits and mac n cheese? It was all old and dry! Chicken was good but I couldn't enjoy my whole meal. My cousin tells me it's probably just the location, at baseline they always make it fresh! We're a big family so we order a lot. On top of that, the lady forgot to give us forks, napkins, dipping sauce we asked for, and we had a missing drink! The two dr peppers we had were flat, and my other cousin ate her mac n cheese with her hands. I will give Popeyes another chance but never this one! It's probably the worst one in the valley! The thing that sucks the most is im on a strict diet and that was my cheat day, cheat day wasted! I'm not happy.."}
{"text":"We love Popeyes. The food is great but the last 3 times we have come, they have completely forgotten one of our 3 orders and they forget items on our orders. Tonight the 3 of us each had a coupon for 5 tenders,  2 sides and 2 biscuits. Two of us only received 1 biscuit and the other didn't receive any biscuits. He requested bbq sauce for his tenders and they gave him ranch. My mom requested ranch and sweet heat and they didn't give her the sweet heat. We shouldn't have to go up to the counter 5 times for them to fix our orders. Not sure it is worth coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Unsanitary. This location is not clean and the service is horrible. Some staff members are good but honestly overall not worth it. Find another location."}
{"text":"Good service. Clean location. It's better than most Popeyes I've been too. Would much rather go to this one compared to the Pickering location."}
{"text":"Would NOT recommend. Don't give them the benefit of the doubt. I have visited this location multiple times, and still have not received what I ordered. Workers are not trained. On my last visit I placed my order and after paying, they all of sudden had nothing that I had order and tried to give me something else that they had. They would not give me a discount or re-ring up the order even though the food they gave us was cheaper then what we had already paid for. In the end we refunded the entire order and waisted 30 mins of our night. We will not be giving this location another chance."}
{"text":"I spent $43.90 for my family to eat, however we had to wash it down with our saliva as this place had no drinks... WORST POPEYES EVERY!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE. My mother and I ordered the chicken nuggets last night at 9:36 PM. Well we BOTH woke up this morning with food poisoning. Steer clear my friends."}
{"text":"Worse place ever , Manager says his name is Albert that  said to write his name on a biscuit because they gave out a cup of soup sauce instead of red beans and rice as ordered. I come back to the location to find that Albert left???? The lady Manager Mercedes on duty just threw rice in the soup and shoved it in a bag and handed it back to me.  Definitely no service and I worked fast food for 7years and a district manager for 3 of those. Mercedes. still didn't hand back my receipt and when I asked for a refund then gets irritated because she never gave it back. While here there is only one guy working and the front cashier but a total of 6 employees on the clock"}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep going back. They constantly have \"broken\" machines, have run outta food or get your order completely wrong."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst joint in town. They NEVER have everything their menu says they offer; one time it's no green beans, one time it's no spicy white meat. Tonight I go through & they gave me all dark meat because they had no spicy white meat. Didn't ask me, didn't say anything, I get all the way home to find out there's no white meat, which is all I eat. I call the store and ask to speak with the manager to which the woman replied \"that's me, what's wrong\" with super attitude. I said we were given no white meat, she said it's because I ordered spicy 
& they were out of spicy white meat & if I came back down & BROUGHT MY RECEIPT she would recook the order. By this time she was being extremely rude. Stressing twice I had to bring the chicken AND the receipt as if I was trying to pull a chicken scam or something. Unreal. When I get there she avoided me all together. The rest of the staff were super helpful. The guy at the counter looked at me crazy when I made sure to show him the receipt. He said \"It's all good, where would you have gotten all this chicken\"....EXACTLY. We used to eat here about twice a week because it's close and I love their spicy chicken, no more though. I can over look small inconveniences of missing items, but I'll be damned if I'm going to have my time wasted without so much as an apology & then be treated rudely like it's my fault for not just sucking it up. You've lost a customer & if that's how you act on a day to day basis, I doubt I'll be the last."}
{"text":"Horrible service. No such thing as fast food here. Sit in the drive-thru for 20 minutes. Then they do not give you utensils or condiments unless you beg. Food is skimpy and dry."}
{"text":"The WORST experience ever! This Popeyes is near my home however I will never return ever!  I decided to check it out and it was one big regretful mistake. 

I visited at 7:30 at night and it seemed that there was an issue with everything I ordered.

First, they had no wings so I was told it would be a 10 minute wait sitting in the drive thru Seriously? I was then informed they had no mashed potatoes so I had to pick a different side.

I then get to the window and the employee says they are out of sweet tea. So she gives me unsweetened and hands me sugar packets
 Um ok?

They also had no honey for my biscuit that I had requested, she replied, we never have honey but is on order and they should have in a couple of days.

It just got worse by the second, honestly I should have just said forget it and drove off.

I inquired as to why they had so little chicken prepared and why no sweet tea.

She replied \"is late and we don't make much chicken\" Hmmm 7:30 pm is late???? Wow. She also informed that the sweet tea is popular so it goes fast.
I replied well wouldn't it be a good idea to check it more often and make sure is being made rather than waiting until it is empty and not available for customers.

She just kept saying is late, so I said so basically I should not visit around 7:30 as it is too late to get what I want?

She then asked her team lead with a major attitude to explain to me why they were out of everything I wanted. She just said \"she ain't know why they out but I can call the next day and talk to somebody if I want?\"

I did call the next day just to issue my complaint and explain what happened. I was met with more attitude and rushed off the phone.

I can't believe this crew that they have serving the customers.

This Popeye's location is pathetic and a big disappointment. They just don't care."}
{"text":"Took over 20 minutes to get mild tenders. Then the kid gave me the wrong sauce. And I have to agree with Edwin D. The portions are so small now. 4 bites for $1.99 for a side. Heading the same way KFC has been heading... down hill. The staff was nice though."}
{"text":"I'm very discombobulated. I really had my heart set on some excellent Popeyes Chicken. 
I've learned over the years to ask up front for the kick-ass \"Cajun Sparkle\" that complements their chicken perfectly. Anymore it seems half of them don't even carry it anymore. 
It took me 20 minutes to get here and im too lazy to go anywhere else. 
The chicken was good. Could have been better but I've already explained why. 
There were many black people there. I liked that. I don't feel I'm at Popeyes if I'm surrounded by \"whitey\"."}
{"text":"8 pieces spicy chicken     
1 mashed potatoes & gravy (4 servings)
4 buttermilk biscuits
______
$17.34 

Seemed steep for fast food take-out.  
Might be FABULOUS. 

For us, not particularly.  When I get pulled in by a repetitive TV commercial I'm trying to avoid, I hate myself.  (But not for long.  I'm pretty lovable.)  In the case of Popeyes, countless fried chicken spots aired in just a couple of weeks.
  
Not much of a TV watcher, probably aired during my husband's favorite sports (I'm generally not glued to it for that) or maybe during those recent Sunday mini-marathons of BReaking BAd (glued like SUPER Crazy Glue Industrial Strength, to THAT).  InCRedibly ENtertaining serIEs.  DIdn't waNT it to eND. 

WHATEVER was on, whenever that familiar jingle \"Love that Chicken from Popeyes\" came on, I tried to block it out, tune it out, look away.  But---by what seemed the hundredth time---I caved in.  Okay Okay, enough already.  By then, I couldn't take it.  The standoff had ended---and Popeye had won. 

~ SPICY CHICKEN
  I love crunchy batter but this was somewhat 
  hard, and there was too much of it;  TOO spicy; 
  I don't mind some heat, but after just half a 
  thigh and a wing, my mouth and throat burned
  for hours; start with their regular if new to this 
  chain

~ MASHED POTATOES
  Surprisingly decent; if an instant form (likely), 
  the best I've ever tasted.

~ GRAVY
  Not the standard chicken or even beef-flavored 
  found up north in our neck of the woods; has  
  that unmistakable Louisiana influence, and
  more like what you'd expect with Cajun and 
  Creole dishes; didn't work for us; good enough 
  tasting, but one I'll always associate with rice---
  never potatoes.

~ BUTTERMILK BISCUITS
  Soft, small, (smaller than McD's Bacon, Egg &
  Cheese); I baked an extra 10 minutes to firm up; 
  didn't like flavor of whatever fat was used to make
  them; might be okay with butter, honey, other; 
  you might like  

Potatoes, gravy, and biscuits 6.35.  Their chicken was 10.99, and 60% higher (!) than Giant Eagle at 6.99, which are much better in preparation and flavor.
 
Maybe I'm out of the fast food chicken coop loop, but $17.34?  That's more like what I'd expect to pay at a ball field concession stand, or from a counter a five minute walk from Concourse C."}
{"text":"Just opened. Bought a 3 piece combo and a 2 piece dinner. Got home and was very disappointed.1 was missing the mashed potatoes and the other was the worst fish I have ever had. It was the size of 3 chicken nuggets put side to side. $9 for a combo is not worth it. Will never go back.
Popeye's that I ate at years ago was 10 times better. They are growing too fast."}
{"text":"Popeyes is a classic. Delicious fried spicy goodness. But come on people. We all know why this place deserves a 2 star rating. We just know."}
{"text":"Biscuits Biscuits Biscuits.  So delicious!  This is the cleanest and friendliest Popeye's location I've ever visited.  Usually busy too.  Not exactly a good choice for those with an eye on the waistline.  Plenty of parking though seating inside felt a bit limited."}
{"text":"If I could give this location 0 stars i would!!!
Worst experience ever ! They made me wait 45 minutes for my order without a reason. As I asked about my order nobody seemed to care until I started to really raise my voice. The so called manager came and was like oh it's sitting right here, enjoy. So my order has been sitting on the counter as decoration instead of them bringing it out to me, since I ordered at the drive thru window, since 45 minutes and nobody seemed to care that it was already cold by now. As I said it's cold by now i would like my order made fresh I got a snappy attitude from them so I just grabbed my order and left  I will never return to this location or recommend it to friends and family.... wouldn't even send my worst enemy there."}
{"text":"I went there the other night around 1050 and they said they were closed. I asked when they closed and they said 11. Pretty frustrating. I've heard the food is good maybe next time I'll get there before they close early."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!! I keep trying to tell myself \"place is new and so are the employees\" . . . .I'm done!! They can't get your order correct if you order it off the menu with no changes. 6 trips . . . .6 failures."}
{"text":"Who gives out coupons in their store that they don't even honor??  But advise you can use them at any other store?  Really???  Where is Robyn the manager?  They need to get her back.  Went a few times since and once order a 12 piece and it had one breast and bunches of wings and smaller parts. We quit going because it is a waste of money. I fear this restaurant will close if someone doesn't get it straightened out.  Visited Zaxbys next to it. Very crowed bit the parking lot was empty at Popeyes.   It is a shame."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week.. the staff is always courteous and polite.   It's always a positive experience.   And I love the mash potatoes with Cajun Gravy !!"}
{"text":"I placed a large to go order. It was placed into boxes and was being bagged when the drive thru/manager got an order for a single meal. She took one of my biscuits and gave it to the drive thru order thus making me wait 5+ minutes for the next batch was made?!!

She put my order on hold to keep her drive thru times down. I was ordering for a family and the drive thru was a single to go order; pray tell which one should be more important? 

My search continues for a clean store with good service!"}
{"text":"Any time you eat at Popeye's and have the spicy chicken you better have to blow your nose as soon as you're done.

This place qualified. Just wished I would have brought a mountain dew with me as they proudly serve coke products :("}
{"text":"I have always ordered from KFC but decided to try Popeye's now that they are in Goodyear. I can't give more than 2 stars. The mild chicken is tasty but my god how small the pieces are compared to KFC. I pictured tiny little chickens running around the farm. The sides were also totally ridiculous. They couldn't fill a shot glass they are so tiny compared to KFC's side dishes. 
I paid for 3 cinnamon apple pies and they were not in the bag when I got home. I'm not driving back 8 miles to get them. You only get once chance to make a first impression and I'm far from impressed. Going back to KFC. Popeye's is dead to me."}
{"text":"BEST SPICY CHICKEN TENDERS IN THE WORLD!  

Every time I go there I get the same thing-- spicy chicken tenders, blackened ranch dipping sauce, red beans & rice, biscuit.  I can't tell you about anything else on the menu, sorry.

The crew is friendly, especially the managers-- always greeting customers as they walk in.

I love that if the chicken is a little smaller than usual (and the usual is large) they will put one or two extras in the box. 

To make it better the only time I go is on a date night with my wife when we go to the movie theater there!"}
{"text":"If you like KFC or Church's, you're not going to like this place very much. Fried chicken is over cooked and flavorless. Mashed potatoes come covered in gravy, which at first might sound like a good thing, but turn out to be soupy and gross. Biscuits and coleslaw are ok, but hardly worth the trip. I was really looking forward to trying this place, but sadly disappointed. Only reason I gave 2 stars is because the servers are pleasant."}
{"text":"Doesn't do the 2 piece Tuesday special thank god kfc does up the street because I am craving some fried chicken today, you should do he deals the rest of Popeyes are as a suggestion"}
{"text":"Popeyes is the same everywhere you go (as far as I am concerned). The only thing that makes this one a little weird is that it is connected to a Gas Station. This seems to be the norm for Nevada, but it is something I just can't get use to. But, while I have a problem with that little piece, I still got a 5 piece with fries. 

I realluy do hate that I like popeys so much. Damn you delicious chicken house!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Popeyes but this location is always very slow. Seem to always be waiting for 10+mins to receive my order"}
{"text":"Man if it wasn't for Popeyes chicken being good this place sucks. Every time I come here I can except 2 things: 1. The long wait 2. Order gets messed up. Smh"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst fast food experience ever!! I went into there seeing that there were 5 people in front of me and knew it would take a bit of time but, an hour!! No exageration either. Every order had something wrong including the people that had ordered even before I got into the place. The women in front of me ordered a 2 piece meal and a 3 piece meal, after realizing that they had charged her for 2 - 3 piece meals she proceeded to go back to the front of the line to tell them about their mistake. They refunded her money and put in a new order for her. During that time a young man behind the counter filled the incorrect order and there it sat. For about 40 minutes. I stood there watching all the previous people continuing to go back for corrections when the manager asked what the order was and who the order there was for. The young man who had filled the order said I don't know who's order it is. They all stood around looking at each other for about 5 minutes before I walked up to the counter and said, I can tell you exacty who's order it is... I proceeded to explain that  it was the order that they had messed up. So they fixed her order and out  she went. When I noticed they  continued to fill orders that were after mine I asked the young man where my order was.I told him my order number and he asked to see my ticket, i pulled it oit of my wallet and finally got my order filled! 
During all this chaos another manager from another location came in to get supplies for his restaurant which took the manger away from her task. She helped him get his supplies and he asked her if he could have some chicken to eat , I guess.? They proceeded to fill his order while all the paying customers had to wait. I will never go to this location again!  I have had other bad experiences here before but never to this degree. Waiting an hour for \" fast food\" is Unacceptable!!  If you plan on going to this location, you better not be hungry . Expect to wait and wait, and wait..."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if I could. Very rude employees ; Popeyes needs to rethink the people they are hiring because these people are the face of Popeyes and quite frankly I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I've never been to a Popeyes before and didn't know what to expect. Seemed like a typical fast food joint, but the experience was made so much better because of the girl talking my order. Kara (cara? Not sure how she spells it) was sweet and attentive, and offered me recommendations. Food turned out to be good, nothing super special but still good. All in all, thanks to good service it was a really nice experience!"}
{"text":"We have been a big fan of Popeyes for many years. This location not so much chicken was very bland."}
{"text":"two trips to get an order correct.  i'm wondering how hard it is to get an order of chicken tenders and a poeboy sandwich correct.  let alone, the person who took my order in the drive through was cleaning the tables when i came in for my second trip there but inside, and had the audacity to say weren't you the one who just came through the drive through not too long ago?  and chuckled and walked away.  then the person who behind the counter looks at my receipt and asked what is she supposed to do with this when i just called 5 minutes prior.  fix my order! make it right.  
and people in the fast food industry are asking for $15 per hour wages when they can't even get a simple order correct.  
\"and what would you like to drink?\" sweet tea.  what was that? sweet tea!  \"i'm not understanding\" sweet tea.  for a place who's staple beverage is sweet tea and them not understanding what we were asking for."}
{"text":"This place has terrible customer service. I was in the drive through and wanted to add a soda to my order and they told me I couldn't get one because someone was behind me and the couldn't re-open my check?! That is so ridiculous. What kind of business is this where I can't add something to my order? They couldn't have gone to another register that was open?! I have never been to a place in my life that was not able to add something to a check. They must not want any business. They need to train their staff a lot better!!"}
{"text":"My review is going to be slightly biased as I have very fond memories of going to Popeye's and having mashed potatoes with my family as our Sunday outing.

I'm going to give props to the store manager for keeping with the Louisiana/Mardi Gras theme throughout this location.  There's a middle display with dried chilies in glass jars and beads draped over them...  It's a little break from the normal chain decor.

Employees were friendly and got my order right away.  I know it's a grind to work in a \"fast food\" establishment, but they seemed to be having fun with it the day I came in.  There was also a bachelorette party coming through (picking up food for the pre-party) so that definitely added to my experience.

Coke machine here...nice to have the oodles of options with your spicy cajun chicken.  

Other than that... prime South Blvd location here... easily visible from the road.  Easy in and out (surprising due to the parking lot design they are working with).  Just watch for those drive through folks if you are dining in."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff!  This location just opened and they are really on top of their work here.  Different set up than most Popeyes but it works out pretty well.  Small dining room,  but in a great location to grab on the go!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype of this place. There are two good things about Popeyes. In general, I enjoy their commercials. And for this restaurant in particular the order taker was super friendly and helpful. That saved this from a 1-star review.  

I ordered the shrimp and a basket of fries. It came with a biscuit. It took forever to get my meal so service is not very fast here. When I sat down to eat it, it was so unappetizing that I wondered if it was worth tasting. It wasn't.  The shrimp are tiny and the fries were the worst fries I've had at a fast food place. The biscuit was decent but doesn't campare to Bojangles or even Hardees for that matter.

Again, what saved this from the 1-star review was the order taker. She was out cleaning tables and asked if I had tried their wings yet and I said this was my first visit to a Popeye's. A few minutes later she arrived with 2 wings and their cajun rice for me to try. Wow, I wasn't expecting that.

Both the chicken and the rice were spicy and that's the best I can say about them. The rice w/ beans had an odd taste to it that was really unappetizing. The chicken had no chicken flavor, just spice.

So while the staff is great here, the food is spicy and fried with very little other flavor. Was it worth trying? Only in the aspect that I'll never return to Popeye's again."}
{"text":"Worst food ever. Chicken taste like rubber, chewy and fatty. Fries were soggy and the pop was all co2"}
{"text":"spent $39 for old chicken with little to no meat. all i wanted was my mac and cheese and they even repeated it back to me then proceeded to give me a large cole slaw when i asked for a large mac and cheese and a small cole slaw. ill never come back i wish i could bring all the food back and get a refund. on top of that they hand me a gallon of fruit punch covered in sticky fruit punch. oh and maybe you can have them add an actual phone number and not a voice mail that's not set up. complete and utter bullshit."}
{"text":"Is it possible to leave less than a star? I've been in line at the drive thru for the past 30 minutes! Still only half way through. Should have gone to Canes or Churches!"}
{"text":"Chicken tasted hot fresh
Biscuits were prefect n hot 
Butterfly shrimp were not butterflied
Gravy was watery
Mash potatoes were served 3/4 of container. 

Wait time at 4pm on sat was 20 mins. 
Asked cashier for napkins and she turned around to face kitchen n ignore customers

Manager hiding in kitchen. Was aware of customers waiting in front but didn't understand sense of urgency for speed of service."}
{"text":"Chicken and fries never taste fresh. Workers are stingy and rude. I love Popeyes chicken but I have been going to other chicken places nearby instead because this location just sucks. I hope other locations open around here."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinners tonight, and the coupon for \"Buy one 3-piece dinner and get one 2-piece combo for free\" made it especially a great deal!  Friendly staff, quick service, and non-oily chicken made for a tasty meal."}
{"text":"I'm so happy we have a Popeyes in Gilbert. We do take out from here oonce a month and always look forward to it.
Thank you #rhythmpopeyesambassador for being very friendly and welcoming! Great attitude from the staff everytime. Thank you for being FABULOUS!"}
{"text":"Just saw that they've finally opened! The place actually came up pretty fast. It's located on Decatur and Flamingo. We went through the drive thru this morning and the service was excellent. The lady on the other side of the speaker was super nice and friendly. When we approached the window, her smile was very contagious! Super sweet! On to our food...

The three piece chicken combo-
It came with a biscuit and a side (which we chose coleslaw). Pretty good sized meal with a good price. The chicken was crispy and tasty.

Mashed potatoes-
Soooooooo delicious. I don't know what's in the gravy, but it's bomb.

Biscuits-
Buttery goodness!!!!!!

Definitely a great place for some soul food!"}
{"text":"This location is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! This team and the manager tonight took customer service to the next level. I initially went to the Flamingo location to pick up dinner after school for my husband and I. My order was cold, and shabby looking. So I stopped at THIS Location, closer to my house, with my receipt to see if they could help- They looked at the time stamp, looked at my order, and Unbelievably, this team stepped up and made a fresh batch for me! They upheld the brand standards & made sure I knew that Dinner was as important to them as it is to me. I can't thank you enough! #happyhousewife"}
{"text":"Service is very slow, and employees are loud. The manager was shouting over my voice as I tried to order. The drink fountain was almost out of all products. Also out of green beans. All that aside, the food was very well prepared."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Not much time to waste when your boarding time is nearing. They make it happen quick for you. And the food was delicious. Airport prices ofcourse. But no disappointments."}
{"text":"This Popeyes was disgusting! Garbage was everywhere in the booths on the side. We came when it was not busy at all and it was still messy. My friend ordered right after me and got his good way later. A group of 10 people who showed up after us all got their food before him! Smh! Now the guy who prepared my food is the only one cleaning the eating area. Poor guy is the only one who is working."}
{"text":"This location is always clean and fast. The few times we have been, we have never experienced any problems. 

The food is always hot and fresh and that means everything when it comes to fast food right? Especially when you can go somewhere else and get the exact same food! 

Popeyes is hands down the King of Chicken for me! I love their spicy chicken. It is just what chicken should taste like - well seasoned and juicy. We always get our chicken mixed - all white meat spicy and dark meat - mild. This is the perfect mix for our house. 

And if you want extra seasoning - don't forget to ask for Cajun Sparkle. I promise you will not be disappointed. 

And let's talk biscuits. They are good. They are not greasy and don't leave your tongue with a coating of grease like Bojangles biscuits."}
{"text":"Most of my visits to this place is because it is on my way home. 

I have been inside once and it was okay. Small because it is connected to the gas station.

Most of my visits are through drive thru, on Tuesdays, catching the Tuesday special. Lines in the drive through can be long, but are mostly always fast. 

Sometimes the guy in the drive thru is not the most friendliest, I guess he is trying to be fast and efficient.

Make sure you check your order. I got spicy one time when I ordered mild. But other than that my chicken is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I think out of all the locations I have been to, this one is my favorite. And it didn't used to be this way. Trust.

Employees are definitely up to par and service is very standard. Wait times are short and food is always fresh and hot. 

I normally come on Tuesday to catch their $0.99 special and in between the hours of 11-1230 as it almost 100% guarantees that I will have super fresh chicken.

The only downside is that the tables are not cleaned fast enough when they are busy."}
{"text":"Who knew that this Popeye's is operated by progressives who hate Big Oil and obesity? I just found that out tonight.

My wife and I went here for dinner after a hard day of work--we looked forward to a nice, big dinner and some relaxation. We decided to eat in the restaurant. Big mistake. We waited for a LONG time and I watched a long stream of drivers pass through the drive-thru and get their food long before we got ours. I know we ordered first because there was absolutely nobody in the drive-thru when we arrived. Maybe I'd be more OK with it if they came out and told me that they did this because the owners of Popeye's have significant interests in alternative energy and they want to cut down usage of gas or something, but until then I'm going to strike it up to mismanagement and disorganization. 

After we finally got our food, we learned that the portions were abysmally small. My wife ordered a three piece chicken dinner, and I almost wonder if something was lost in translation because the size of the pieces of chicken were tantamount to those that come from a Cornish hen. I ordered a Shrimp Po'Boy, and evidently the word \"shrimp\" referred to the size of the sandwich in addition to the contents of the sandwich. Again, I am all for fighting obesity, but providing dollhouse-sized pieces of chicken at mansion-style prices is not the answer.

I really, really don't want to go to KFC because of the despicable way in which they treat their chickens (as well as the fact that they verbally abused PETA protesters in front of their Cleveland Heights store, and then proceeded to verbally abuse me when I told the employees to leave them alone), but at the same time I don't want to go back here again. Time to find a new place to get fried chicken around Tremont!"}
{"text":"Placed an order about 40 min an advanced. Wasn't ready. The owner was nice enough to admit to the mistake. Place seemed kind of hectic up front with the workers."}
{"text":"Ordered the Cajun chicken combo. The fries were plentiful and the chicken burger was decent, had better. Not as good as the old Popeyes days where fries were bigger and sandwich buns were softer. Clean joint. Warning: the sandwich is spicy, so prepare! At least for me it was spicy."}
{"text":"I love Popeyes spicy chicken and red beans and rice! I've been to many locations in the valley and this store is the absolute worst! Each time I've been here the wait time is 15-20 minutes, I've never had this happen at any other location. It's not like I'm ordering a huge unusual amount, just a combo meal. They also gave me plain instead of spicy chicken, I won't be back ever again."}
{"text":"Definitely not 1/4lb of shrimp. Whatever way you flip it breading or the actual shrimp! Worst experience ever. To top it off the GM was the one to help."}
{"text":"Got dinner to go! And it was delicious! It was super fast and easy. The staff was so friendly! I definitely will be returning soon."}
{"text":"If you are a Popeyes fan, This Popeyes is more than legit.  Great food and Management is on point (meaning great attention is paid to their customers).  I'd recommend this Popeyes to anyone."}
{"text":"Upon entering, I liked the interior of this location way better than all the others I've been to. All tables were to the side, and there was ample width/room for lineups. I ordered the Shrimp and Chicken combo for $7.49 - 2 tenders, 4 butterfly shrimp, a side of fries, a drink and a biscuit. I also got the daily special of 5 spicy wings for $3.99. This location lets you fill your own drinks....so I refilled my cup 3 times. 

The tenders were not as crispy as I had hoped, but the flavour was all there. The shrimps and fries were on par with the other locations I've been to. The spicy wings didn't taste spicy at all, but I still enjoyed it minus this one burnt piece of ...fat(?) that was clearly overfried. The cashier who cashed me out cleaned the tables when there was no lineup, and I'm happy that this location has designated wheelchair tables. Staff was way friendlier than all the interactions I've ever had with Rutherford Popeyes's staff. They didn't have washrooms though, so boo.

EDIT: I was informed that they do indeed have washrooms near the cashier. Guess I just missed it!"}
{"text":"\"sir your meal is going to take 10 minutes to cook, is that ok?\"
famous last words...
as a person who has had food poisoning(hospitalized) in my life, im not ever sure why this wait time would not be ok...please cook my food...
I should really go out of my way to ask if people complain about the wait time for food. 
this location is one of my favorite popeye's, the service is great, the quality and flavors taste a bit better then normal. 
I would go out of my way to come back to this location for sure. 
parking lot is massive, but can get hectic around lunch/dinner time."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in one month and its a great location. The staff is polite, the store is clean, and the food is delicious. Yes you have to wait 5 minutes but at least its delicious and doesn't taste like its frozen coming out of a freezer!"}
{"text":"Long the Tuesday special the food is always hot and the chicken is very good my favorite Popeyes beer friendly."}
{"text":"I came here with my brother, staving. We came in around noon so there was a slight lunch rush. The cashier was friendly and was able to all questions during my order. Including if I wanted mild or spicy, which generally I would have to request at other Popeyes. 

Tables were kept clean. I got the two piece combo with coleslaw. So tasty and definitely satisfied my craving. Chicken was hot and juicy, biscuit was warm and awesome. The chicken wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be though."}
{"text":"As far as Popeye's goes, this location is average. True, it's close to home. True, they serve my favorite chain fried chicken. Service was good. But the restaurant itself felt greatly disorganized, which I can understand since it's relatively new.

On the plus side, the employee who took my order was in training and made sure to point that out. I train a fair amount of new hires at my work, so I know how important it is to establish this communication and nurture it. She did an excellent job.

Something that irked me, and is in no way reflective of Popeye's, was the sheer repugnancy of my fellow patrons. However, the manager efficiently handled the angry man who cut in line in front of me. There was also a group of young people who apparently loved to hear themselves hooting, that was annoying. Good grief, I sound like my dad.

Overall, it is what it is. Like Arnold, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I hear Burger King is buying Popeye's (or at least BK's parent company). Shame, because that may mean a drop in quality. So I plan to make it up to this Popeye's more frequently in the coming weeks and months to get their delicious spicy fried chicken out of my crave zone.

Recently, I came here after work because I needed some comfort food in the form of crispy fried chicken. As Popeye's isn't really nearby, but is my favorite chicken chain, I made a special trip to get an 8 piece for that night, and a 3 piece meal for the following day's lunch. It's more frugal to do it this way. Trust me. The spicy chicken was crispy on the outside and relatively moist on the inside. Nothing a little dipping sauce didn't fix. The green beans were perfectly smoky, and the biscuit really doesn't need butter (but I recommend it anyway).

Make your way to your nearest Popeye's before BF busts the good thing Popeye's has going."}
{"text":"I came here on my break on 4/15/16. I asked for two $5 boxes, one with a two piece and the other with tenders. The girl who helped me, Blanca, was ridiculously rude! First she didn't let me know the options of what kind of chicken I wanted thigh or leg. I had to ask if I had options. Then when I pulled up to the window, she had the most unpleasant look on her face, didn't greet me just asked for my money. As she was handing me my drinks one of them almost slipped from my grip because she was so carelessly holding them. Once I got my food and I asked for hot sauce, ketchup and honey she acted as if I irritated her. She basically slapped the condiments in my hand causing like 3-4 to fall. Once I got back to work, my order was wrong. I asked for fries and green beans for my sides and got green beans and mashed potatoes instead. She also failed to give me ranch for my tenders, I guess that's my fault I forgot to ask. But all in all by far the worst customer service, and she needs to be in the back with an attitude like hers."}
{"text":"Dear Management: Please hire more employees because this restaurant is not doing that great in terms of efficiency and cleanliness.

I felt so bad for the staff here because it was obvious and apparent they were understaffed. They were doing their best too. One guy was managing the cash register and preparing orders. At one point, there was queue of about 5 parties. 

After waiting about 10 minutes to order our food, we had to wait another 20 minutes to get our meals. Apparently, they were waiting on new biscuits. Since we were in a hurry, we just got our meal orders and told them to bring us the biscuits afterwards. There were a lot of disgruntled customers too. 

Hot. Spicy. Delicious. We got the 3 pc meal each and it was delicious as hell! The fries were super crispy too. I felt like they were both super fresh and juicy. Mmmhmm. I probably gained like 10lbs+ from just eating here.

To the left of our table, there were trash from a previous party. Overall, the restaurant was in great shape and appeared clean besides this.

I'd go here again if I wasn't in a hurry. Again, I'm not blaming the workers who work at this restaurant. This message is a main complaint to management for not being able to manage and hire enough workers to staff this place."}
{"text":"I pretty much order the same thing all the time...family meal with chicken tenders, two red beans and rice and biscuits.

Chicken was good.  Red beans and rice were more rice than red beans...I like it the other way around.  Biscuits were ok.  They forgot to ask me if I wanted honey (and I forgot to ask), fortunately I had honey at home.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Since I pretty much try to eat healthy lol this is one of my favorite not so healthy indulgence.  The service has gotten much better and I  live the Cajun fish."}
{"text":"I am so happy that they got rid of the people that worked their before. Those people were horrible  plan and simple. Who ever took over is doing such a great job.  The customer service is great and the portions are better.  Ever since they changed management I have been here 5 times in less than a month , before I go maybe twice in 3 months because of how horrible the service was.  So with that being said I will be going to this location as often as I crave  Popeyes.
Happy Yelping xoxoxo"}
{"text":"Stopped by and tired as the KFC that was previously located closed. I thought that the food was good and fresh but a little overpriced, and I wasn't offered any sauce to go with my tenders."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about Popeyes, but their fried chicken is so good! I once got KFC because I was like, \"oh they're both fried chicken so it's probably going to be about the same.\" No way! I don't really know what happened to KFC but it's not as good as it used to be.

Popeyes is really good at making every location taste consistent. It always tastes fresh and crispy. The spicy option is also great. The mashed potatoes and fries are yummy but all the other sides are okay. 

Service was good here. Definitely recommend this squeaky new location."}
{"text":"This store was disgusting when I was in ages but I gave them another shot this past week.  I ordered and pulled up to the window. While sitting there with the drive thru window wide open I see a guy come out if the kitchen with a little cigarette in his mouth talking about how he dropped his phone in the fryer.  I'm pretty much done with this location entirety and this company all together. I've never been in a Popeyes and thought to myself they really take care of their locations. They seem to hire crew and managers who other restaurants deem undesirable."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and tasted good. Service was really slow and apparently their drink machine has been broken for a while and it takes several minutes of them ignoring you to get a refill. Not sure if I would come back or not."}
{"text":"Don't fall for all the Popeye commercials for best chicken. They are by far the WORST FAST FOOD CHICKEN RESTAURANT. Their chicken is all skin and no meat. I live right down the street and I would rather get in my car and go to KENTUCKY FRIED. That's worth the trip."}
{"text":"I only come here for the occasional two-for-Tuesday special. The service is standard for a chain and I never have any issues with having to wait too long for my order or them running out. Overall, I have a satisfactory experience typically."}
{"text":"I bought food from Popeyes at the stephanie location, great service by the way. And do to traffic food became cold but i didn't want to bring the cold food to ST Rose parkway Hospital it was waiting in my car for more than an hour. I thought maybe if i stop at another location on the way they might be able to help me out. So i decided to stop by the popeye's on rainbow But i walked into the worst customer service EVER!!!!! I just ask if they could remake my food i had my receipt the food was untouched and the girl who was helping me walked right behind me to a table of four Management staff and they immediately said no because they are franchise company very rudely responded. I turn around and i ask them face to face, but Jessica and Tony started to give me attitude they didn't even want to talk to me or give me any help they literally brush me off like a piece of trash. I never felt so disrespected, also keep in mind the fact that the store was not busy at all not even a fly around the cook was just standing in the back doing nothing. This so call management team definitely needs to be evaluated ASAP. Their is a reason why this locations has a bad repuation. I will for sure be spreading this all around Facebook, newsletter and more."}
{"text":"This gem is just what this area needed there isn't much in the way of southern food in the north but this change of pace blows kfc out of the water I travelled 17 miles to get a few buckets I chicken because it's so good I ate on it for days."}
{"text":"Foods really good im happy to have some southern food in the north po boys are my favorite."}
{"text":"Best food great people behind the counter great deals too if you want good southern food close to home this is it"}
{"text":"The store refused to honor an advertised special.  I don't know if the advertisement was incorrect, or the store just didn't want to honor the special.  I asked to speak to the store manager, and was told the General Manager wasn't there.  The manager's assistant first agreed to honor the advertised special, and took my order, but then the General Manager, who I was told wasn't there 2 minutes earlier, showed up and refused to honor both the advertised special, and his assistant who had said that he would make a one-time exception and honor the advertised price.  This is a classic bait and switch to get people into the drive-through with a good special, and then have them order at full price because they are trapped between cars, and need to wait anyway.  Be aware that this location might not honor the specials that Popeye's advertises, and if you ask to speak to a manager, you might get the same \"he's not here\" story that I got."}
{"text":"Food is good, staff was really friendly and helpful. It was clean and fast. It was busy when I was there but they managed the crowd well and there were no long waits.

The biscuits are my favorite and they didn't disappoint. The fries are always crispy and fresh.

I really can't think of anything I didn't like or anything I want to complain about. Which is rare with fast food experiences"}
{"text":"When this location first opened the store was always clean and the staff was eager to be of service. 
 There has been alot of staff changes and not for the better. 
 The last few times I visited this location it has been dirty, food is never ready and the staff has been less than helpful including the Manager. 
 The last time I went in the place was dirty and there was a mop bucket in the middle of the floor, they had very little food ready and there was trash on the tables. I was told they were very busy but there was no one in the dining area and no one else waiting. The food I ordered wasn't prepared so they asked if I could wait, I agreed, but I saw no ine in the kitchen cooking. After about ten minutes the back door opened and the staff came in but seemed more interested in talking than working. After a long wait my food came out and I went home, the order was incorrect, the chicken wasn't fully cooked and the order of popcorn shimp had barely any shrimp in it.
 This place needs a new crew or the business will fail."}
{"text":"This place just feels really dirty upon entry. The air is humid and greasy as the AC appears to be toned down to save on electricity. The floors have a subtle slipperiness to them possibly from the greasy particles in the air landing on it. I can live with this though as I just want my fried chicken.

On to the order. The cashier was totally absentminded and lazy.  I ordered the daily special and asked how much it would cost to add an extra piece. The girl at the cash replied with nothing then punched in my order and said that's already finalized. I'm sure if she wanted to she could have just as easily canceled the order and redid it. It's the Tuesday special for crying out loud! Nothing overly complicated. No one was even in line behind me at the time so she didn't even need serve anyone else.

I had to order another piece on a separate order wasting my time and possibly more money.

The chicken that I got was nothing like the Popeye's I've come to know and love. The chicken had grease just dripping off the skin to the point that the skin wasn't even crispy. Soggy, greasy chicken is what I have to put up with after dealing with the incompetent cashier? Absolutely disgusting and vile.

The worst part of this horrendous experience? I didn't even get a single napkin thrown in to help mop up the grease from my wet chicken.

This place was great when I came a while back but now it seems to have regressed into a depressing shell of what it once was. 

Will definitely not be eating here again."}
{"text":"I love popeyes. It's kind of a big deal in the south. This ones not quite the same and takes its sweet time pulling together your order but its still pretty good."}
{"text":"Mom has never tried Popeyes in her life.
She loved it! For me, just call me Olive Oyl because I love me some Popeye's chicken.

We waited for a bit. But the good things in life are worth waiting for and we were being entertained by another woman ordering after us. She was fussing about her string beans and gave us a good laugh."}
{"text":"Thumbs down. Few hrs before they closed - they were out of whatever the new special think beer can chicken. Ok. So ordered something else. They don't have the full menu- or what I thought was the whole menu as I've only eaten here maybe a few times, but not what was listed online. So tried some chicken tenders and jambalaya. Jambalaya was edible and better with hot sauce. Biscuit and ton of honey was tasty. Tenders were horrible. Gave them to my garbage disposal of a husband. Service was ok. Asked for a cup of water- received a cup of ice."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying popeyes and was looking forward to it. We drove up to the drive thru and boy....the line was Looooooong. I ordered a 2 pieces combo, spicy favor, with a side of claw slaw and mash potatoes. The chicken is very tender and the side dishes are delicious. I'll come back here again and try something else."}
{"text":"Got a fried tenders meal. It is pretty good quality airport food. I specially recommend the Cajun fries. I couldn't stop eating the fries. Chicken was juicy, well cooked and well seasoned. I should mention that we got the spicy chicken. Of course ,I recommend it if you like spicy food. 

I will definitely try the local Popeye joints based on this experience."}
{"text":"I came in here and ordered the 2 Cajun Poutines, one for myself and the other for my daughter. It was there special of the day, and with it ordered one spicy breast piece. The cashier said it would take 6 minutes, in which literally took 13 min and told her I'd wait. When receiving our order, we looked for a seat to sit down, which was not to difficult since we were the only patrons.... Hence the tables were not clean and had chicken crumbs    And other residue. I told the cashier in which she came by and wiped it down with a wet towel, not a Lysol wipe. My daughter took one bite of the poutine and said Ewee nasty, the fries were mushy and the cheese had a different look and texture, no cheese curds here. The cheese looked literally like toothpaste as the cheese was very white. 
What really annoyed me was the chicken burnt my mouth when I took my bite as the oil was juicing out if the chicken when I took the bite. I gave her my piece of my mind and all she said \" oh I'm sooty it was suppose to cool down. 
Believe me guys Popeyes is not normally like this, but this particular restaurant watch out and beware....."}
{"text":"I order 3 pcs and ask for white meat and there is an up charge. I then order the Tuesday special which is $2  something and they says its red meat. I ask if they can up chatge they say no. So I ask the combo 2 of 2!pc $7.99 regular and ask for white meat and they say  there is an up charge. So whats the diff on tuesday special of 2 pcs and the combo $7.99 2 pcs ? In some Popoyes they dont upcharge me if I ask for white meat."}
{"text":"I love me some Popeyes!  The food is as all Popeyes are. Good stuff, however, the red beans and rice we portions are skimpy. Containers only 3/4 full. It is pricey."}
{"text":"I like fried chicken, I perhaps would say that I'm a fried chicken fanatic.  Normally I like Popeyes any chicken that is spicy.  The chicken here wasn't spicy enough and the outside and breading wasn't crispy and crunchy enough.  Regardless, for airport for it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. The rice and beans are the best and the spicy fried chicken. Zero complaints."}
{"text":"They need to pay Brianna more because she was working really hard while everyone else was just hanging around. She seems to be the one who runs the store. If i was the owner I would have fired a bunch of people in the store today and gave her a raise since she seems to be working twice as hard for others to slack off."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to order alone in line for about 20 mins, as more people walked in. The service here is the worst I've seen at Popeye's, ever. They just keep attending the drive thru orders. They won't even say why they're not taking orders inside. They won't even look at you, let alone give an explanation. This is another level of disrespect."}
{"text":"The only thing salty in this review is me! I'm salty that I even had to select a star. 
*salty means upset/pissed*

First I went to get 3 naked chicken tenders and they told me they didn't have any which I know isn't true because they make them fresh every time (first excuse) and when I called them on that they told me to hold on and then said they didn't have the seasoning to make it... this made me think it was just a BS excuse. 

Second, I asked about the spicy tenders since I couldn't have the naked and they said they couldn't make those because they were frozen... like wahhhh!?!?? 
So I settled for the mild because that's the only thing they had, when it was time to go to the window they had us sitting there and didn't say anything until they came with our food (10 mins later). He (OBJ wanna be) came to the window and just demand the price not sorry for the wait or anything and after I paid he gave me the food and just slammed the window! Not even saying have a good night or anything ! Such abysmal service! Rude people shouldn't work costumer service! And how are you Popeyes CHICKEN but you only have one type of chicken!? I will be calling cooperate about this as well... like I said in the beginning IM SALTY !"}
{"text":"I've given this Popeyes more than just a few tries and each and every time I'm beyond disappointed. Although the food is usually good (if you can get anything you actually ordered) the service is beyond terrible/ rude. Not only do the staff mess up on every order, taking over an hour to get through the drive thru, they screw you up intentionally while laughing to the the other employees. 
The first time I came to this Popeyes I asked for extra BBQ sauce and extra honey over three times. When I looked in my bag I realized she gave me some weird spicy sauce instead of BBQ and ketchup packets instead of honey packets. She tried completely sabotaging my meal!! 
The second time I come, over an hour and a half before closing, they say they're out of chicken tenders. I had already been in line for OVER 30 MINUTES already just to be told they were out of food, then proceeded to be stuck in line FOR NOTHING for another 45 plus minutes. The entire time the kid (michael Robinson) was mocking me through the window. When I got to the window I asked \"if you can't make any more food, then what's taking 20+ minutes for each car at the window?! Makes no sense\". They're doing it on purpose! 
Third time I come to Popeyes, they only have spicy tenders (imagine that) so I try those. I see the same girl packing my food who was involved in the first incident, when I get home I realize she gave me green beans instead of mashed potatoes. Seriously on purpose again! Ruined my night once again. I should have gone back and gotten what I ordered but who wants to go out again and wait in another hour long line.?!? Oh and same day I ordered a Dr Pepper with my meal, after I already pay they tell me the Dr Pepper is gone. (Probably just too lazy to fill the machine) 
Today I go to Popeyes again but I decide to go in and make sure my order comes out correct. Out of Dr Pepper once again, when the one and only nice/ good employee there told a coworker to change the Dr Pepper, he whispered under his breath to \"shut up\". She then proceeded to tell me Dr Pepper was gone.. The same kid who was in the second incident (Michael Robinson) was taking orders in drive thru and he's laughing telling the coworkers the customer ordered half and half with blackened and mild but to give him all spicy. The girl boxing the food tells him no, stop doing that (obviously he does this often) and to stop \"fucking with the orders\". He then proceeds to tell them \"no no he ordered all spicy\" (he didn't). And I'm sure that customer was very disappointed when he got home and had all spicy chicken when he wanted mild and blackened!!! He thinks it's funny I really don't understand. SO irritating. The place was DISGUSTINGLY DIRTY as well. While eating my food there was a hair in/on my chicken. These workers are so crazy they probably put hair in people's food just for the hell of it. I'm never going to Popeyes again. These people should be fired/ sued."}
{"text":"Phones are always of tha hook . So ya can't call back and ask what's on this old piece of chicken . Why is it gray ?? I sure would like ta go back and get a explanation. But I seriously don't they will do anything about it . Tha crew was s pretty kind just not sure they know how ta make tha call on a good  piece of chicken. Oh well I just dumped it . Not much more I can really say just that I don't think I'll go back ta that Popeyes's chicken again anytime soon . So out of respect I'll give them just one star for effort .  But I sure wish I could figure out why my fried chicken was gray and bent on the outside I would just like for them to answer that question I really have nothing else to say that's about it so Popeyes I'm more than willing to give you a second chance if you reach back out at me because I paid $14.04 for crap and no one ever picks up the phone and don't try to get a hold of the Circle K next-door because they will just tell you they're different and they can't even be kind of go over and let the manager know that someone is trying to get a hold of them"}
{"text":"1 word
Ghetto

Instead of mopping up a spill, I witnessed several employees walk through it.  1/2 the staff playing around while watching how to reload the soda machine. A kitchen full of people, why in the hell sis my order take so long? Ain't nobody in the dinner room or the drive thru."}
{"text":"I love Popeyes and always order the spicy chicken. I got their 11 piece special and the chicken was tasteless. I didn't taste any flavor let alone any spice. Are they putting any seasoning into the chicken? Will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Wanted me to wait for chicken they already done. Called a 12 piece all dark special order. Took forever to make the pies. Didn't want to give me my order until I appeared rude. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"The service here is always spotty but the chicken and fixins are still top notch.  Last time I was in, the manager and the girl at the counter were playing some sort of wrestling game which its great that people want to have fun at work but probably not the most appropriate way to conduct oneself in view of the public. It didn't hinder the speed at which the food came out and the everything and the food was great.  So I guess it just goes to personal tastes to how a workplace should be run."}
{"text":"While I was happy when this location was stood up, I won't be returning after visiting the dining room. Besides the horribly awkward interaction at order time, we were disappointed to see very few patrons, yet NO clean tables.

What we witnessed next was disgusting. The same checker used a wet rag to push all the trash down in the can, and then proceeded to use that same nasty rag for the tables.

The women's bathroom had 2 stalls, yet an employee was in there for quite a long time with the door locked. My wife thought that was extremely odd."}
{"text":"I always hate coming to this location, the customer service is horrible, they treat you like someone who farts at the dinner table. 
be sure to check your food before you leave, you never know what type of mystery meat you actually have in your bag and don't be surprised if you end up waiting a long time, it's all part of the failed staff they have here....welcome to popeye's"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Popeyes I've ever been to, customer service is horrible, I've been waiting to get my order taken for about 15 minutes, it's 7:09 7/26/16 I'm leaving now because I have to get back to work and I had to go to the drive thru to get my order taken, I am gonna write to corporate office, this isn't the 1st time."}
{"text":"Don't know how one can mess up an order so bad!   Asked for mild chicken, got spicy. Asked for mashed potatoes and gravy, got red beans and rice.  Asked for ranch and buffalo sauce for my tenders, got nothing.  At least I got tenders and not fish or shrimp.  AVOID!"}
