{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem. It is so hidden that even though I come here about every other week, I still walk by its entrance because I don't notice it, then I have to turn back feeling stupid.

Nonetheless, to me, this place is one of the most Montreal-like places in all of Montreal. I always bring my visitors here and they all love it. Whether if it's for the great food, or the awesome bands, or the cool atmosphere, I can't say."}
{"text":"This was an excellent food joint! An excellent beer joint, and a wonderful venue for live music. It's definitely divey with a shabby chic sort of vibe. But the vegan food is excellent! The beer is wonderful. People, mostly of the college age (no wonder, it's near the university)  pass the time here eating, drinking and talking. It's well off the beaten tourist path and it's incredibly affordable.

I'd say it's one of the best values I've had anywhere in the world. The food was top notch, I had a wonderful hummus sandwich and my wife had the tofu pasta. It was a bit spicy and simply superb. We even had a vegan brownie for desert. Yummmm! 

I'm not sure how many more times in my life I'll be in Montreal, this was my first visit. But, I will guarantee on every visit from here on out, I will be eating and drinking at L'Escalier.

Don't let the neighborhood, the surroundings, or the decor deter you, this is an amazing restaurant. You won't be disappointed. Climb the stairs and get up there!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Great food - outstanding value for money and great live bands! Try the veggie burger ... best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here I had some pretty good beer I also had the best nachos, they were bomb! It was large enough to split with one or two people. But it took forever to come (like an hour, no joke). But they did have an awesome band playing! I decided to come here for a third time cause I had a pretty good experience the last two times. I came with about 10 other people, big mistake!! We could not find a spot to sit at cause it was packed, and there wasn't a spot for our jackets and shit so we had to go somewhere else. Overall pretty chill place,  kinda hidden and it was always packed when I went, so don't go at night with a lot of people. Oh also... When you enter it smells like cat litter."}
{"text":"Café très convivial. HIP pour les granolas chics. HOT pour les veggie lovers.  Et SUPA HOT pour les geeks en soif de Wifi illimité! Yééééé!  Mais encore mieux, c'est l'antre de choix pour tous les amoureux de petits groupes de musique Undagrrround, les Jazzeux, les reggaeman, les upcoming bands d'acid jazz, les poètes urbains, les conteurs et autres insectes de ce genre :).   Si vous vous sentez bien en jeans avec une grosse pinte et un t-shirt et que vous n'êtes pas un fan de viande ni d'articles de mode, vous vous sentirez comme chez vous. Pour un petit prix, je vous conseille les tapenades, la pizza aux quatre fromages (mon vilain péché) et le divin cidre aux canneberges!  Wahouououou! Exquis!  Grands dieux, facilement, je consomme trois bouteilles de cet elixir divin.  

Idéal pour les meetings en journée, car le WiFI y est gratuit, gracieuseté de nos chers amis d'Île Sans Fil. Visitez Ilessansfil.org et procurez-vous un mot de passe avant de vous rendre à L'Escalier sur le site d'île sans fil pour moins de trouble.  

Oreilles sensibles s'abstenir à partir de 5pm, car le soundcheck pourrait être en vigueur en vue du 5 à 7 du band de la soirée.   

Idéal aussi pour les regroupements de geeks en chef.  Bienvenue aux gros groupes! Les nachos et les pintes vous séduiront.  

Ne prenez pas l'escalier étroit, vous risquerez d'y rester pris...... Hahaha :)"}
{"text":"À moins d'une minute de la station Berri-Uqam, ce très discret restaurant végétarien au cadre de porte artistiquement coloré nous dévoile, une fois recelé, un long escalier au bout duquel se cache un univers déconnecté de l'agitation montréalaise. Un genre de paradis hippie où il fait bon s'assoupir sur des coussins confortables, déguster une cuisine consciencieuse (salades, végé-burgers, hummus, tofu mariné, pâtes aux pesto feta, etc.), boire un bon vin bio, s'immuniser avec une délicieuse décoction de kombucha, ou encore  laisser tranquillement dériver son esprit en bonne compagnie.

Biscornu, incongru, chaleureux, inutile de mentionner que l'Escalier est un important repaire artistique. L'endroit se transforme chaque soir en un concert culturel, tant musical que narratif, où des hordes de semi-attentifs avachis vous échangeront des regards complices...ou absents..."}
{"text":"They have one waitress here that is a super duper bitch.She has blond hair and dark eyebrows and speaks french. The rest of the staff I haven't had any problems with.The music is great. Don't even bother speaking English here....(you know what I mean)Some creepy patrons come in.The place looks like someones grungy home.The food is bad. It takes forever to get to you."}
{"text":"Very hip place, zen yet full of surprising energy from all the different type of crowd you see there. Loving staff, the place gives that same family feel after 2-3 visits.

Food is excellent and alcohol is satisfying.
If you're backpacking in town, be sure to stop by relax on a couch i. The back and go through the book cabinet- there is always some surprisingly great reading material."}
{"text":"Mon bar préféré à Montréal !

Le lieu est vraiment unique : on s'y sent chez soi et c'est un plaisir de venir y passer des après midi entière.

Le staff est très aimable et détendu, les coktails sans glace sont très bon, les plats végétariens sont excellent et surtout : il y a des groupes qui viennent jouer là presque chaque jour de la semaine et la qualité est toujours au rendez-vous !"}
{"text":"Totally miscagetorized as a restaurant

This is a great pub/cafe

It is several rooms in what feels like a  house.

The large front room has a stage+ bar, then there are other separated rooms with couche and small nooks.

I love the layout- you can find a little corner and talk if you want, or you can be in the fray in the front.

Cheap stuff, RIGHT across from a metro and near late night food+ gay village

What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner and drinks with a friend and was given a very small menu with hummus being the only vegan option, although it was not mentioned anywhere that they had a different menu after a certain time. The drinks were good and the food came out relatively quickly. Very inexpensive as well. The live music and casual seating was very cool. Great place to go with friends."}
{"text":"This hidden gem which you can literally miss and walk past if your not paying attention gives off the hipster like vibe within. Embodying a college feel, so to say an grown-up coffee shop that offers live music and drinks. Very relaxing if you come here in the afternoon to catch up with friends or work on assignments. The books available for read in the other room is a nice touch for atmosphere that the bar gives off. Very welcoming"}
{"text":"Such an eclectic spot! Food was delicious & fresh, ambiance was amazing and the live music was incredible!! Cash only but they have an ATM. We came on a Sunday night and it was pretty packed but still had a few open tables. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Le meilleur endroit pour découvrir de la bonne musique locale à Montréal! Des bands non-stop de 17h à minuit, toujours de belles découvertes. Bonnes bières et si vous y allez l'après-midi les bocs de bières sont à 4$! Menu végétarien, j'ai goûté aux nachos et ils sont très bons! Je recommande fortement aux adeptes de musique :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Satuday around 6:30-7pm.
Place was pretty empty.

First thing is to get a table, then a menu. Place your order at the register and wait till they bring your food. If you don't read French, read the menu beforehand with google translate (the menu will not be translated for you).

Ambience: Decor is funky meets Pirates of the Caribbean. There was a jazz band playing.

Service: The girl at the register was nice.

Food: Had the nachos with cheese and tomatoes. They could have used more cheese or a cheese that melts better. Also had the vegetarian pizza and that was quite yummy.

The food wasn't out of this world but it's a cool spot to try. Plus it's quite cheap!"}
{"text":"Les soirées salsa me rappellent l'Espagne et ses soirées enflammées! Mais il n'y a pas que la salsa, il y a plein d'autres soirées de prévues comme du slam, du jazz et j'en passe.
Ce café-bar a vraiment un cachet particulier! On dirait un appartement ouvert avec plusieurs coins et recoins.
Question bouffe, c'est végétarien et équitable!
Seul hic: il faudra être un tout petit peu patient pour s'y rendre, car ils sont fermés du 18 juin au 9 Juillet 2013 en raison de rénovations."}
{"text":"Really casual veggie resto bar hidden upstairs. Affordable menu of tasty bar type food. Eclectic comfy decor. Order at the bar first (try the nachos!) then find a table. Enjoy live music and chill vibes."}
{"text":"This is usually a bohemian live music kind of joint, but on Sundays, it's Latin night! Montreal is known as the Latin capital of the North, and spend any time there you'll see why. It's just a different way of life unfamiliar to the Anglo-Saxon world. From the fashion sense of the average resident to the unique culture that is French-derived (i.e. Latin). There are lots of  people from South America and the Caribbean in this city and they like to come out here to dance some salsa once in a while. The live music is great and the beers are cheap.  It can be a little cramped and you'll sure work up a sweat on the dance floor, but fun will be had for sure!"}
{"text":"Will be back again and again.

L'escalier is not your typical lounge or upscale trendy bar. Instead of cushiony seats and waitresses in tight skirts you'll be welcomed into a laid back bohemianesque home. Whenever we usually head into L'escalier there always seems to be an amazing band of varying genres performing on their small stage - and I'm always blown away by the talent. Choose a spot either cozy and tucked away in the back or grab a small table up front and relax while picking one or two delicious items off of their all vegetarian menu! Their specials change all the time and have yet to be disappointed. Pitchers are the usual price for downtown (on the pricier end) but the atmosphere makes up for that.

They only take cash - and there is an arm on site so that's something to take into consideration.

Have never had a bad time here and since we live only a few blocks over, will return throughout our time in Montreal."}
{"text":"A cute little place tucked away where you would least expect it. Went on a Wednesday evening and it was packed! They have live music every night and a variety of vegetarian snack and meal options reasonably priced. Nothing fancy though. You're not going there for the food but more for the music. We got a bottle of wine, pretty reasonably priced compared to what you'd pay at the SAQ."}
{"text":"Highlight of our week in Montreal! Friendly interesting People, three bands a night, yummy appetizer plater, good beer and lemonade, reasonable prices, cozy space, all around good vibes! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is such a fun place to go to for drinks and local live music. I saw The Bobby Dove Band play here on July 5th and they were great! Love the atmosphere. The decor reminds me of some of the off-campus student housing near my old university."}
{"text":"This place reminded me of the Williamsburg Hipster joint in NY. One of the Yelpers recommended this place - situated right across from Jardin Émilie- Gamelin.  After walking a steep stair case - the aluminum foiled walls, worn out chairs and pressed wooden tables  immediately caught my attention. It was amateur night! There is complimentary WiFi and charging ports at every table. Beers were cheap and if you order a sandwich they give you a plastic animal to recall your order!"}
{"text":"This is a neat little place that serves beer, some food and has live music. The atmosphere is really really chill and the people there are friendly and eclectic. You could easily miss the entrance to this bar unless you happen to notice people outside smoking or waiting for friends. The bar is upstairs and can get really warm so dress appropriately!"}
{"text":"this is my absolutely favorite place to eat and hang out in Montreal!!!

first of all it's all vegetarian and the menu is extensive! 
the prices are in medium range but there are discounts for students.

the best part about this place is the ambiance! a bit hippie and very relaxed. It has multiple rooms - each of them decorated differently. Some has couches, some have tables, some have rocking chairs, some are lit by the light from a window, some with a candle lights. 

There is also a bar stand and live music concerts. 

The staff is very friendly and mostly only french speaking. 

They also only accept cash (I always forget that)

It's hard to find them at first but if you know the exact address look for a tiny door that will lead you directly to a 2nd floor through a narrow set of stairs. 

amazing place to hangout, eact and relax!
enjoy!"}
{"text":"So glad we went here. Awesome atmosphere, even better staff & food. Live music, seems like locals come here. Super cozy and def not a trendy, touristy spot. Def not to miss!"}
{"text":"Endroit où l'on se sent presque chez-soi, sans prétention, et où il y a diverses soirées comme les Soirées poésie Solovox avec musique pour accompagner. Un autre univers carrément!"}
{"text":"Fun! Cheap! Chill! Good vibes all around. Really cool venue. The food is what you pay for. ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"Très bon petit bar de quartier avec live musique (tous les soirs? à vérifier). En tout cas, j'y suis allé un lundi soir et c'était pas mal plein!
Bonne ambiance, large choix de drinks
Service passable, les serveuses avaient l'air occupées à discuter ;)
Mais bon, c'est quand même une bonne place, que je recommande!"}
{"text":"Il faut aimer le genre. Assez hippie même beaucoup. Si vous aimez le style c'est un plus. Mais on va se rejoindre sur la nourriture, j'ai vu BEAUCOUP mieux."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place after reading the other reviews. But what is it with some alternative places. Do they not have noses? The air in this restaurant was so stale it turned me off completely. Learn to open the windows and air things out every day! 
Also, no one said hello or even looked at me when I came in and walked around a little looking for a table."}
{"text":"Really nice vegetarian place on Sainte Catherine.
Don't be scared by the door (and the stairs), there is a lovely cafe with a great vibe upstairs and very affordable and a lot of their food is made in-house... How can you not love this place!?
Sure, you need to wave your arms and do the wiggle in order to get someone's attention (even when it's not busy), but once someone has seen you, the service is great and friendly.
We had the hot chocolate, the deluxe nachos and a vegetarian paté sandwich with a carrot soup. Everything was delicious... yes everything! And all that for less than 25$ (taxes and tips included!)
As a certain Arnold might have said : \"I'll be back!\""}
{"text":"Friendly. Comfortably like a hippie student union. Various dusty couches and third hand furniture, live music, old musty wood and a lot of different rooms. Some floor-seating. 

Everyone's friendly enough. The food is dense, ethical, simple and good. Temaki pasta was huge portioned. Grilled cheese was small, sharp cheddar and crusty bread. Good beer options if you want to try local beers."}
{"text":"Grungy looking place with a grungy clientele. It's been cleaned up a bit since then, no more street people or kids coming in to just smoke pot or sleep; guess all the cops dropping in to look things over, changed that. There are now some Tiffany-styled hanging lamps, the walls have been painted, and the clientele is starting to resemble the Cagibi types. As for the food, better to eat vegan at Panthere Vert and DEFINITELY avoid their vegan baked desserts.... ewww! If you just want to have a few beers or drinks, you will have to order food though; they only have a restaurant, and not, a bar license. I have to add here, there was a mouse running around the place the evening we were here,NOT a little white pet one either, very off -putting. All in all, I think most come here for the very relaxed, laissez- faire vibe and sometimes good music, than anything else."}
{"text":"I liked the hipster/quirky vibes this place had going on. While I didn't eat or drink anything, I appreciate the fact that this place is vegetarian and really affordable. I especially liked how large the space was, with tables to fit different sized groups. Charger plug friendly - which is a huge plus! They also have live music in the evenings. Will probably return if in the area."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The vibes were great, the beer was good, and the music was awesome! Came for dinner on a Thursday night and it was great! Good vegetarian food as well."}
{"text":"Incredibly chill, hip, and good vibes all around. The beer is cheap and the ambiance is nice. You can find people chatting, dancing, and having a good time. Not sure why it took me so long to find this gem!"}
{"text":"Every Monday night at 9 they have a traditional Quebecois music jam session with lots of fine fiddlers and other assorted instruments. It was a wonderful night preceded by good pizza and salad and a very friendly staff. Bohemian in nature, full of students, warm and welcoming and across the street from the Metro."}
{"text":"Bon euh. Oui, l'Escalier, c'est bien. C'est confortable quand on réussit à s'écraser dans un sofa. C'est comme une vieille maison où les pièces sont encore divisées, chaque pièce ayant son petit caractère. Ça donne des espaces assez restreints où on respire peu. Disons qu'il faut aimer la proximité. 

Les soirées trad du lundi sont intéressantes (si vous aimez le style, bien sûr). Ce n'est pas la seule soirée thématique. L'endroit embrasse les cultures et les genres, et ça paraît dans sa programmation. Ça, c'est cool. 

Parlant de style, c'est hippie rare. Ça détend, parfois. Parfois pas. Faut être dans le mood. De temps en temps, un.e junkie du Parc Émilie-Gamelin réussit à monter l'escalier étroit (vraiment, la place porte bien son nom) et change un peu l'atmosphère. 

Correct pour la nourriture, sans plus. Si vous voulez une bière pas cher, passez le mardi, ils ont quelques pintes à 3$ (du style Boréale blonde et rousse). Et pour le café... pensez-y deux fois. Contentez-vous de la bière, pour vrai.  

Vraiment pas mon préféré, mais c'est un spot quand même pratique quand on se retrouve à Berri entre amis et qu'on a vraiment un besoin intense de bière pas chère. 
Dreads inclus."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Good local beer. Samosa that I had with hummus was amazing. Very small portion though. Highly recommend for a quick energizing stop."}
{"text":"Great jazz and nice brews! Open late and friendly folks. Really enjoyed Feel Burned and bought a CD."}
{"text":"A friend from UQAM brought me here. Great for a snack or healthy lunch with a side of beer. Pick through some of their collections of old books and board games, just don't be surprised when you're missing some peices."}
{"text":"Very fresh vegetarian food. Had a sandwich on multigrain bread that was so fresh and wholesome. Side salad also good. Menu was only in French but staff was helpful. The atmosphere was different. It is on the second floor and you could easily miss it if you don't have the address. The average age was about the same as my children but no one really took notice of us older folks. They had live music which was fun. It was like being in an old house that needed some work. The food service was very clean. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Will return to try more yummy things on the menu."}
{"text":"tellement original et génial comme endroit! ambiance décontractée et parfaite pour boire un verre entre amis. il y a même des divans si tu veux faire un petit somme. pintes à 3,50$ de 11h30 à 17h00 parfait pour ton portefeuille d'étudiant. j'adore et je vais certainement y retourner"}
{"text":"Driving down the street, we had a tough time locating this cafe. The restaurant next to it is at 550 Rue Sainte-Catherine, but the building number for L'Escalier is actually out of order, and is the number BEFORE it. Only a darkly painted doorway and a colourful sign is all you have to go on - and possibly stoned-looking youth smoking ciggies in front. 

Located on the second floor and sadly, not wheelchair accessible, L'Escalier has a tune of its own - creaky floors, laughter and the clinking of beer glasses. It's kitschy, dark and grungy, but it's alright. 

We popped in on a Saturday night, when it was busy as a beehive and made the risky decision of sticking out here when we had a schedule to keep. The small counter where drinks and food are ordered is usually served by one exclusively French-speaking attendant, who scribbles all the orders on a notepad. Yes, it's cash only. As well, the counter is approximately ONE meter away from entrance, a set of narrow and awkward pair of wooden French doors. Therefore, awkward line-ups are often formed and you may find your face in someone's hair as your tummy is growling anxiously. 

Drinks get served on the spot as you order, but the cooks here can't do the same - my boyfriend and I ended up waiting more than 30 minutes to get an apple and cheese sandwich and a pesto pasta. I was probably wearing the bitchiest look I owned and I'm sure that I stuck out like a sore thumb in a place that's pretty down-to-Earth. 

Lesson learned: don't come here if you're in a time crunch.

Even as I was fuming - smoke was practically coming out of my ears - I'll admit it was a damn good sandwich and pretty tasty pasta. Not only was the timing a turn-off, but the decor didn't impress me one bit. The furniture is old and rocky, the pillows are gritty and I'm not sure how often they run a dust cloth and broom through this place.

Great budget hang-out and reliable food, but not really my scene."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere and live music.
I loved this place. Might be one of my favorite in Montreal. 
It's a little hidden and has an awesome athmosphere. The food is good and cheap. Plus they have live music and good beers."}
{"text":"The only place in Montreal that reminds me of new Orleans, They have great early beer specials. I can always have interesting live music. There is no cover but a good pass the hat. 
the food is amazing . 
You can study, drink or flirt.
I advise you all go. Invite me to!!!"}
{"text":"Have you ever been to a vegetarian pub? Well, I have. L'Escalier on Rue Sainte-Catherine E near Berri-UQAM is one of such a kinds. It is not a fancy pub, but it is surely a hidden gem.The food and drinks are good & cheap, add fun to the fantastic atmosphere & live music. At times you would find students performing. An adorable place. 

Cons: Finding parking nearby is bit of a pain."}
{"text":"Super place si tu es un étudiant ou que tu veux déguster une bière sans te ruiner. L'espace est gigantesque, c'est un ancien appartement reconvertie en bar. Leur menu est pas très étendu mais il y a le nécessaire, bière, vin, konbucha, et quelques plat (sandwich, nachos et autres gâterie). C'est adapté aux groupe si tu trouve de la place, il y a plusieurs grandes tables. Ou bien tu peux t'installer dans un de leur salon pour étudier. J'ai jamais était déçu, il y a aussi des concerts et des \"open mike\" de temps à autre."}
{"text":"This is exactly what I'd been looking for near work. Healthy, well-made, vegetarian basics. It's shocking how hard it is to find a decent sandwhich in this town. The place is easy to miss and both the service and decor are bare bones but the people are friendly, the menu is creative and the quality to price ratio is impressive. Cash only, so come prepared."}
{"text":"My friend found this place through foursquare and we went last night, I assume because I'm vegan and they wanted to make sure is have something to eat.

Our whole group loved this place it was definitely busy but still many of us were wondering why it wasn't completely packed.  Everyone enjoyed loved their food, we were very happily surprised at the portion to price ratio and the decor and live music made it really cool.

The things most popular at our table were the pestso and the cheesey pasta (not sure what the actual name of that one was). I personally tried the vegan pate sandwich and the vegan \"pizza\". Neither of which I can rave about unfortunately, though neither was bad and I did enjoy the pate. I think it's a bit misleading to label something a pizza when it comes on a tortilla (they note this on the menu), but aside from the tomato sauce there's very little in common with pizza on the vegan option.  I think they'd do better to rename it an open tortilla or something.  It seemed to have a peanutty sauce on it in addition to the tomato and the added tofu gave it more of an Asian flavor palate than anything I think of with pizza.  

I'd still recommend it,  I just think I'll order something different next time I'm there.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"warning for anti-grévistes: this aint the place for you! stay the hell in Westmount you want something more..erm...\"traditional\".

But if your not a Jerk (and you support the Quebec Student Strike) you will LOVE this place. They always have vegan baked goods and homemade kombuchas as well as a decent selection of veg meals. but you dont come here for the food, you come here to chill. Strike slogans are written on the bathroom walls, the staff are hippies and its always filled with UQAM students. L'Escalier is one of the chillest spots to chill in MTL.

Warning for Anglophones: this joint is UBER francophone. good luck getting English service, however that adds to the charm for me, as it gives me an opportunity to améliorer mon français sans jugement."}
{"text":"Without a doubt my favourite Bohemian/hippie spot in Montreal. 

Yummy well-priced veggie food, friendly staff (the lady with the wicked tattoos has wonderful energy and smile), and very relaxed vibe. 

I recall there being free wifi when I did some work there one time. 

At first glance it would appear somebody forgot to finish the design i.e. where did the consistency go? Every room is different - a mish mash of tables and chairs in one spot, then around the corner there's couches or mats for sitting on the floor, and the beauty of it is it works. Yet, there is a consistency in flow and feel here. 

It's very easy to strike up a conversation with randoms in there. There's lots of natural lighting and candles.

There's also live bands playing every night I believe. (Check the website to be sure). 

Literally 2 mins walk from Berri-Uqam metro, if you're in Montreal you must drop by this place. In many ways it's representative of the relaxed and welcoming feel of the city and its people that I've come to love."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of unpretentious, unique places with a rustic charm of their own. L'escalier is one of them. Hidden on one of the second floors in St. Catherine, this is one place you must go to. I usually go there with my friends for beer or wine and reasonably priced food. The place takes cash only but they do have an atm machine.
The vibe of this place is infectious, filled with chitter-chatter and laughter. They have live band performances on some days of the week . A must go place for casual fun times at reasonably priced booze :)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for live music in Montreal, this is the spot to be. 
No entry charges. 
Super cheap beer. 
Amazing crowd/vibe at most times."}
{"text":"L'Escalier est un établissement assez unique et atypique à Montréal. Une fois qu'on trouve la porte d'entrée sur Sainte-Catherine (elle est relativement discrète) et qu'on gravit les fameuses marches, on a le sentiment de rejoindre un groupe d'amis dans un appartement d'étudiant. La clientèle semble justement être composée, en grande partie, d'étudiants de l'UQÀM. Le bar est divisé en quelques pièces principales, chacune avec de la décoration différente mais avec assez de chaises, divans et fauteuils pour accueillir autant des petits que des grands groupes. À chaque soir ou presque, il y a un band qui joue dans une des pièces situées près de l'entrée. Le niveau sonore reste toutefois largement correct. L'ambiance est très \"hippie\" (for lack of a better word) et laid back. Quasiment trop, au final: j'ai dû attendre un peu plus d'une heure pour que les plats commandés arrivent sur la table. La nourriture en tant que telle est OK: les prix sont bas (pour 2 entrées et 2 plats principaux, j'ai payé 30$ avec taxes et tips inclus) et vous obtenez ce pour quoi vous payez. J'apprécie toutefois que l'entièreté du menu soit végétarien et, surtout, qu'il y ait beaucoup de choix véganes. Je considère donc L'Escalier comme une bonne option pour aller prendre un verre entre amis (ou même étudier ou travailler si vous aimez l'ambiance!) et manger un petit quelque chose en plus mais, par contre, je ne le recommanderais pas si vous cherchez simplement à manger. L'Escalier me semble beaucoup plus proche d'un bar que d'un \"vrai\" restaurant.
Quelques choses à savoir cependant:
- Des pâtisseries véganes sont disponibles!
- Commande au comptoir (on vous donnera toutefois une figurine à poser sur votre table pour vous apporter la nourriture)
- Argent comptant seulement (il y a un ATM sur place)
- Essayez de garder un peu d'argent en main pour pouvoir en donner au band à la fin du set
- Attention à la marche située entre l'entrée et la pièce à votre gauche, elle est dangereuse!"}
{"text":"Voilà un super endroit pour sortir, manger, boire un verre et écouter de la musique ! Comme son nom l'indique, il faut monter un escalier pour arriver dans ce restaurant divisé en plusieurs salles dans une ambiance décontractée mais aussi chaleureuse et colorée. 
Le menu est végétariens mais il y a également des plats végétaliens, et tout est à un prix très raisonnable et très bon. On peut également n'y venir que pour boire un verre et profiter de la musique puisque plusieurs musiciens et chanteurs se relaient durant la soirée ce qui donne beaucoup de vie et de bonne humeur à l'endroit. 
Bref, j'ai été conquise par l'Escalier et je ne manquerai pas d'y retourner !"}
{"text":"This is a VERY student- friendly hub (mostly UQAM) so if you want a sophisticated, grown up spot to chill, you're out of luck here. But if friendly servers, cheap vegetarian food, wine, beer, sangria and homemade treats are up your alley, then you're in luck. Having funky decor, a laid-back vibe and the feeling that there's zero chance of running into someone you know here are all pluses as well. During the day, it's pretty quiet and a great place to read or get some work done. In the evenings, it livens up quite a bit since it is also a small performance space. 
Cash only."}
{"text":"L escalier c est un peu la place autant faite pour bouquiner dans un de leur fauteuil caché dans un petit coin, mais aussi pour partager un repas végé avec une belle gang d'amis autour d'une grande table!

L'atmosphère qui règne est la définition même de \"chill\", pas de prise de tête ici on est relax et tout le monde est le bienvenu :)"}
{"text":"It surprises that it's taken me so long to review this spot. It's totally a Montréal staple that I've taken for granted for a long time. An eclectic transformed apartment space with vegetarian and vegan noms and live music, l'escalier is a bar/venue of its own kind. Even in Montreal. While it's admittedly become increasingly dingy with the years, there's something about it's mismatched everything, hanging plants, and occasionally surly staff that warms my frosty montréalaise heart. 

One of the best and worst parts of this establishment is that it draws in literally everyone. Right at the most Western section of the village, with UQAM adjacent on every other corner, you'll find this place just as easily packed with loud and obnoxious students as you will with young professionals, professors, and punks.

Most importantly, they have a fantastic happy hour (pretty much the entirety of the afternoon) and a daily special that generally really kills it for bar food. I've definitely had some fantastic work sessions here."}
{"text":"L'Escalier est difficile à trouver tout près du resto Dagiovani.Un repas vegan à 7.95 vin bio un peu cher. Service très courtois. Un band jazz. Décor étudiant des années 70. J'aime."}
