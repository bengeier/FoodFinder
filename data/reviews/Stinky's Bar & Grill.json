{"text":"Good food, best wings in Pittsburgh, cold beer, friendly staff...what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Really a working class establishment , great selection of food , there are so many choices I try a different entry every time I come here . Believe me I'm a picky eater and this is the place to find your niche, give it a try you will love it ........"}
{"text":"It's named that for a reason! Bad food and lots of smoke and parking on the weekend is no picnic don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service, great prices. Had the calzone special, $5, really good, fresh mushrooms, tasty red sauce.  Friend had a burger, had a bite, wonderful grilled taste.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised by this place, the outer appearance and the name don't necessarily lead someone to think food here will be delicious and it will be a welcoming environment.  We sat in the side area of the bar.  Service was a bit slow, but the bar was very busy and the bartender was working our table as well.  My husband tried the sausage stuffed jalapenos and I had the fried ravioli.  The amount you get in an appetizer in my opinion was more than usual, which was very nice.  My husband liked the jalapenos but wished there was more sausage and would probably try something different next time.  The fried ravioli was delicious and their marinara sauce is good too.  We both went with burgers for dinner, he had the jalapeno cream cheeseburger and I had the real whopper.  Both burgers were very good, the flat top gives a nice crunch to the meat.  And both burgers are huge!  We look forward to coming back, might be our new go to place for good bar food."}
{"text":"The place purposely double charges it's patrons. Definitely check your receipts and credit card statements. Others warned me about it but I didn't realize until I sat down to do my taxes and looked at my credit statement. Double charged quite a few times without me knowing. I even looked at the slip when she brought it to me so I could prevent it from happening. She must do it once you leave or makes a copy of your signed receipt."}
{"text":"The fish was delicately breaded and fried just right. It's as good as Piper's Pub! The zucchini strips were handbreaded and excellent as good as Piper's too!! The rueben the bf had was really good as well!!we will definitely be back! Great place!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best bar food in the city, this is really a hidden gem with a dining area and a bar that allows smoking. If you can't find something to eat on the menu you don't belong in Pittsburgh.  The bartenders and fellow patrons are all very friendly which creates a nice enviroemnt wether you are alone or with a couple friends. An upstairs bar is also available for private parties."}
{"text":"Stinky's is magical.    Daily food specials were what drew us in, everything else is what keeps us going back every week.  This might be the best burger I've ever had, and on Tuesdays (as of 2015) they are $5!  Any burger!  not just like, a cheeseburger, or a naked burger.  ANY burger.  They are awesome, obviously not frozen, on amazing bread, with fresh veggies always.  The staff is super friendly, they always remember me (maybe I come here too much).  Food specials include Tacos and wings, on certain days.   There are 4 massive rooms, so you can go with your fam and chill in the back, or hang out at the bar and smoke and drink.  There are outlets everywhere, and free wifi.  My boyfriend and I like to finish up work here during the week while having dinner, and not feel like a bunch of weirdos.  Typing this review from Stinker's right now!"}
{"text":"We went to Stinky's last night for the first time and the 5 stars was largely for the wait staff who were the kindest, friendliest ladies we have ever experienced! The food was very good also. My husband had a burger and I had the codmother (smaller version of the codfather). We selected a side of coleslaw which was enormous for a side dish! The potato skins were also very good. We left stuffed to the gills. It was worth the ride to this local bar/restaurant!"}
{"text":"With hockey season back in full swing this thursday, the better half and I decided to hit up stinkys for some take out.  We were gearing up to get home, devour our food get drunk and listen to 90's music.  Yup. I hadn't been to eat at stinkys for a few weeks, I felt like I had abandoned my home.   We walked in and were greeted as usual by all the employees.  Some of the customers also gave a wave, a nod, or a smile.   Our food was superb, this time I opted for a change of pace and god the ribeye wrap.  (My usualy being the wings, the chicken tenders, or the buffalo wrap).  First time having it, and it was good. I was so pleased and nostalgic that I had to go back to stinkys the next day too.  Good lord. I ordered a bloody mary and a buffalo chicken sandwich.  And everything was right in the world.  I couldn't ask for a better place to watch my pens games at.  Or, for that matter, better company.  Everything there is a true fan, an excited fan, and friendly. I love the banter during hockey games, the drink specials which always leave me walking (er, stumbling) down butler street content and slightly drunk.   If you haven't been to stinkys you should try it sometime.   But don't go during hockey games unless you plan on joining in on the screaming and fighting."}
{"text":"Good food and service. It can get a little loud and crowded but it's a bar so that is to be expected."}
{"text":"After living down the street from this bar for ~2 years, I finally ventured there last night and was very impressed! My friends and I took a cue from the other Yelpers and went to Stinky's during a Pens game and had a great time.  We all got wings, (because who can pass up the Pens game special of $0.40 wings?!) and there were zero complaints.  I got the \"stinkers\" flavor, which I was informed was a garlic, hot and bbq mix.  They were delicious!!  My mouth is still salivating and I may have licked the sauce off each finger in the most un-ladylike fashion, but I couldn't let any go to waste!  Among my friends, we tried the Ranch, Hot and Cajun flavors and everyone liked what they got.  The bartenders were friendly and made sure we knew right away of the specials, like when the Pens score, you get $2 off your next beer.  Not only is this is an amazing deal, but I appreciated that the bartender informed us of this, as she probably realized it was our first time visiting.   As for the atmosphere, there are a ton of TV's, which makes watching the game convenient from wherever you're seated.  The place was pretty big too - we had a table in the main area, but noticed a side room with some games and a back room with tables and pool table, maybe?  Also, (as a girl I feel the need to proclaim this in writing,) Stinky's bathrooms were about the nicest/cleanest I've ever seen in a bar!  The only small complaint is that it was a bit smoky, but I've learned to deal, and almost expect this, at most bars so it wasn't a deal breaker for me, at least.   If you're looking for a laid-back, no-frills type of bar to relax with your friends, I absolutely recommend this bar.  Off the beaten path of Butler Street, it's like a little hidden gem in Lawrenceville.  My friends and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Customer service means a lot to me.  When you walk into a new joint and the bartender greets you, asks you what your name is as he shakes your hand, inquires about your day and treats you like family you know you're not in for an ordinary experience.  I was in the neighborhood and I stopped on by to watch a game.  The bartender here made my experience just right.    Why am I docking a star? Stinky's really isn't a misnomer.  This place reeks of stale cigarette smoke.  PA needs to get over itself and do like it's neighbor to the west by enacting an indoor smoking ban."}
{"text":"Stinky's is one of those places that if I lived close by I would probably be there a lot, most likely too much.  We watched the Pirates opener here this past Sunday.  We weren't planning on staying very long but as we settled in we decided to just watch the entire game here.  They have a separate dining and bar area.  The bar area is large and the big U shaped bar is perfect for gathering with friends.  They also have TV's that surround the bar so no matter where you are sitting you don't need to turn your head to see the TV, there is always one right in front of you.  They offer a limited selection on draft, about twelve or so. There is a nice selection of styles from IPA's to ciders, Ales, Shandys and some domestics.  They also have a cooler that offers up more variety.  The bar is clean and so are their restrooms which is definitely appreciated.  The bar is a little too dark for my liking with no natural sunlight coming in, but at night I guess that wouldn't matter much.   I didn't try their food since I had just came from eating, but I will the next time I'm here.  The menu had many options, not just your standard bar fare, and at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Stinky's is a great place to catch a Pens game and eat some delicious food. I came here with my boyfriend on a weeknight, and we took advantage of the cheap beer prices and sixty-cent wings during the game. We also each ordered burgers...don't judge! I got the southwest burger, and it was wonderful. The toppings were evenly balanced, and the whole thing was very big. It came with a pile of glorious crispy fries.   The general atmosphere was casual and the entire establishment was very clean...our table didn't have that greasy residue some bar tables can get. Our waitress was so sweet and handled everything perfectly. She was attentive but not overbearing. I also love how she used our first names. It was so friendly of her, and I really appreciated it. Overall this is a place I can really see myself becoming a regular at. Especially during playoff season!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar, unfortunately the cigarette smoke is rather obtrusive.   I like the beer selection, with lots of local craft brews on tap.   There is lots of help behind the bar and service is quite attentive."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar, love their everyday specials. I think we went there on a Monday night to meet up with some friends. It was a quite pleasant experience. They have two sections, one for smokers and the back is nonsmoking area. Love their everyday $5 twisted tea and Monday $5 appetizer,  $6 quesadilla. Be sure to ask the waitress the one you are eyeing on has special deal. I think steak quesadilla was participating in the specials.  We got the stuffed jalapeño, nachos, fried pickle and fried ravioli. They were all good, I can't complain at all for $5. They have a lot of beer selections and pretty much everything on the menu. It was a huge menu and hard to pick. But I think that is the charm of this restaurant. I would go back there for sure."}
{"text":"From the outside, it looks just to be a dive off of the main drag. Bad stereotype. The food is very good and the service is always excellent. Affordable prices. Lots of TV's. And big bar. Been here many times and always in restaurant part. No complaints. Actually have our networking group use this establishment during weekdays lunchtime."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour with some friends- one of my friends is a regular and comes here weekly. The inside was newly renovated and was pretty nice. We sat at the bar for a while and then moved to a table when our group expanded. I mainly tried all appetizers, as many of them were discounted with the happy hour special, and I was NOT disappointed.   Fried Zucchini- Delicious. Obviously homemade, lots of flavor.  Fried Pickles- Again, clearly homemade. The spicy ranch really complimented them. So tasty.  Buffalo Chicken Dip- YUM. The pita chips served with them were OUT of this world. Drooling thinking about them.  Fried mozzarella- By far the BEST I've ever had. They were incredibly juicy, fresh, and HUGE. I could not get over how delicious they were.  Mac & Cheese balls- Again, homemade. Huge. Delicious.   See a pattern here? Everything was homemade, and everything was incredible. I was really blown away and can't wait to come back here again!"}
{"text":"Last night our Girls Night Out gang ate at Stinky's for our monthly outing.  We arrived after 5 and ordered a menagerie of appetizers including fried zucchini, fried pickles, banana peppers, onion rings, fried mushrooms and a meatball appetizer with marinara sauce. Appetizers were $5.00 from 4-6 which was a great bargain, in addition to the deliciousness of all the appetizers.  The meatball appetizer was excellent and the marinara sauce was to die for!  The banana peppers were a little hot, but they came with cheese bread to counteract the hotness.  We also ordered an order of the fish and chips with cole slaw substituted for the chips.  Their fish is perfect (will go back for a fish sandwich soon) and the cole slaw was the best we all have tasted.  For dessert, we ordered the brownie special which had ice cream and whipped topping with hot chocolate syrup on top.  It was delicious. When we first got there, a lot of us thought we would be getting the burgers (the special for the evening) but we were so filled there was no room for the burgers.  Another great part of our dinner was our waitress Megan.  She was the best, attentive, yet not too bothersome.  She was there when we needed her and was very funny and personable.  She asked us our names and knew who we all were.  We even told the owner Val to put her on the schedule for the third Tuesday in January as we will be back for our next GNO and we want her to wait on us again.  We will be back as this restaurant/bar is fantastic.  You have to go there to see their extensive food and drink menu.  Loved everything about it!!!!"}
{"text":"Cool little place.  Neighborhood bar, nothing fancy.  Good place to go for a beer."}
{"text":"I was disappointed, but I will be returning.  Stinky's has an adequate beer selection.  Everyone in the party was pleased.  The beer pricing is excellent.  The place was extremely clean which is awesome.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the staff are extremely friendly.  My disappointment was that they offer pizza using a frozen crust.  Why would they do that?  Horribly disappointing.  The wings on the other hand were great.  The sandwiches looked good, as did the salads.  Don't get the pizza and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"You know my kids really loved this place! I think half of the reason was because of the name. The restaurant area was very nice and completely separate from the bar so it's very kid-friendly back there. My kids had their pizza, which was great and my husband and I both had the hamburgers. I think it is extremely hard as an establishment when a certain food item (in this case their hamburgers) have been on \"Best of\" lists and/or have won awards because you often have high hopes for these places. Our hamburgers where perfectly fine and tasted good. They just weren't a \"Wow, no wonder these burgers are on the best burgers in the US list.\" We didn't find anything extraordinary about them honestly so I was slightly let down some. Parking, of course, is ridiculous in Lawrenceville but this place had a small parking lot in the back. So get there early for dinner and you should be okay."}
{"text":"It's a dump. And I don't say that in a pejorative way. I love dumps/dive bars. Some of my favorite all time places are ones you wouldn't take your mom to. The beer selection runs to your neighborhood tavern style selections. Don't be looking for no craft beers here! But I'm ok with that - it's what you'd expect when you walk in the door and your eyes behold all that's in front of you in it's seedy, turn of the century splendor.  Food is interesting if not superb. Good menu of diverse subs and specialty sandwiches with names like Mom's favorite or the Big Skunk. Prices are good and portion size is large. We ate at the bar - seemed to be the thing to do - so I can't attest to any of the \"restaurant\" qualities of the place.   It's a little seedy and doesn't give you the feeling you're in the cleanest place in Lawrenceville. But if I'm in the neighborhood, I'd go back! Guess it's that dive lover in me. And this is a dive!"}
{"text":"I was this for dinner tonoightof the 4 dishes we ordered only one was decent. The zucchini on the appitizer platter tasted bland & greasy, everything was just ok. The burger was deffently not the best in the city, the porkchops we a cheap cut. The mashed potatoes with gravy was on best just averaage & I swear the fish was old, even the water taste was nasty. We ate there several times before and it was good, this time was horrible. Don't know what the special was because the waitress did not tell us.  Nothing we had wouldmake us come back again orreccoment your place to anyone. We will not be going back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Tried to go to stinkys tonight to meet up with some friends. We were one table short and they didn't help us reorganize our seating so our group could sit together. When we tried to, they wouldn't let us saying it was a hazard to have the tables the way we put  them. We dealt with it and sat for 15 minutes while the waitress took the order of our group minus me and my boyfriend who were the ones separated. I was hoping this place would become a new hang out spot but it's safe to say I won't be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to go to when the penguins play. Great food, great drink specials, and the staff is ok."}
{"text":"Went for a spicy theme today and it was delicious! Banana pepper app with the jalapeño cream cheese burger...unbelievable! I'll definitely come back! Sat in the bar area which does allow smoking. As a no smoker they had great ventilation! I wouldn't have known someone was smoking if I didn't see them. Service was quick and friendly!"}
{"text":"I love Stinky's...$1 beers and the best wings I've had in Pittsburgh on special during all hockey and football games.    If I have Spicy Garlic sauce from my wings left over, you will find me trying to eat it with my fingers.  It's that good."}
{"text":"Can't even get a simple take out order correct. One would think that they would be checked for accuracy before hey went out."}
{"text":"I moved here from Chicago last year and immediately went searching for a \"local\" bar. After a few tries, I stumbled into Stinkys and, well, I really haven't left. The owners, Paul, Val and their son, Bobby, made me feel welcome the first time I came in. The staff is friendly and provides great service. The menu is more extensive than most chain restaurants and is fantastic. I particularly love their wings and nachos.   Bottom line - if you want a fun, friendly bar, come to Stinkys! You'll be glad that you did!"}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago on a Friday in Lent. I got the cod father, and it was probably the best fish sandwich I've ever had. I will definitely be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This places has hands down the BEST wings in the city.  My husband is from Buffalo and he would drive half an hour once we move to the burbs to get these things.  The staff was super friendly and we really felt welcomed, even though we were just hanging out at the bar waiting for take out every time.    It is a little off the beaten path and if you blink you might miss it, but keep your eyes wide open for this one."}
{"text":"Stinky's is a cool little dive on the corner of a residential section of Lawerenceville. I wandered in on a Friday afternoon and it was pretty quiet except for a handful of people pumping money into those ubiquitious slot machines that are a staple at all Pittsburgh dives.   The girl working behind the bar was friendly and the regulars that patron the place ended up being pretty friendly also. There is the awkward moment of walking into a \"regulars\" bar during slow hours were everyone sort of looks at you with a cocked eye brow and giving the \"who the hell is this guy\" vibe. But if you can weather the initial outsider feeling a regular will eventually start chatting you up and before you know it you feel like you've known everyone at Stinky's your whole life.   I heard the food is good, but when i stopped in I'd just ate lunch so this time didn't try any."}
{"text":"Good fish sandwich and burger. Wide variety of food on the menu."}
{"text":"You can smoke and eat wings at the exact same time. Plus the staff is great and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"There's just something about Stinky's.  We have lived here over 3 years and just stumbled across Stinky's last month.  Not literally.  We drove there.  On purpose.  And yes, we have been back at least once a week every week since then.  Stinky's has that kind of allure.  Stinky's is one of those rare contradictions that seems to work out: a sports bar with a separate dining room, to please different kinds of patrons.  A smoking bar that's very clean.  A divey-feeling place that isn't a dive at all.  It's just a really great, all-around neighborhood bar.  During Pens season, you get sixty-cent wings and $1 off your drink every time the Pens score a goal.  There are weekly drink specials, too, but nothing that's blown me away.  The happy hour is on the early side (4:00-6:00), so we have not been able to check it out.  The tap selection is modest, but they always have one good IPA on tap -- and that makes this poster a happy girl.  What do I like most about Stinky's?  The Codfather.  No joke, that is one delicious fried cod sandwich.  Am I obsessed with fried fish sandwiches?  Yes I am.  And Stinky's does not disappoint.  The service has always been friendly and fairly prompt.  Lots of TVs in both rooms of the bar for watching the Bucs win.  I hear there's karaoke on Friday nights, which we just might need to check out.  A great convivial atmosphere when the game is on -- you can just jump right in and cheer your heart out, and everyone at Stinky's understands."}
{"text":"We love coming here for karaoke on Friday and Saturday nights.  I don't partake, but my friends and some other regulars do, and it's highly entertaining.  I've only had the wings, which are delicious, and they offer a variety of sauces.  Drinks are cheap, relative to the other bars in the area."}
{"text":"I used to live in Pittsburgh, and this was my absolute favorite bar.  I lived within walking distance, so it was perfect for stumbling home and not worrying about having to drive :)  The owners Paul and Val are some of the nicest people I've ever met and they're great with the patrons.  The food is excellent, the beer selection is great and reasonably priced, and I love \"Horneoke\" and \"Stinkyoke\" nights (and I miss those days dearly!).  This is definitely a \"regulars\" type of bar, but they're also very welcoming to new visitors as well.  You can find quite a mixture in this place...old, young, hipsters, yinzers...and everyone gets along :)  I visit this bar every time I make a trip back to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Great food! Terrible smell!  The buger I had was fantastic and the fries, while not fresh, were very tasty.   However, you end up smelling like you chain smoked 3 packs of cigarettes.  It's a shame really, this could be \"a FANTASTIC bar with unbelievable food,\" instead it's \"a bar with good food, but the flavor starts to diminish the longer you're there.\""}
{"text":"A co-worker raves about the food here, swearing by their fish sandwich. However we actually came here to watch a high school classmate in concert, one who sounds just like Bret Michaels.   He was delayed by the Penguins playoff game though. How can one compete?  I need to go out to watch Penguins games more often. They scored as soon as we sat down in the back, away from the madding crowd, and eventually overcame a deficit to win the series.   Man this place is a quintessential Pittsburgh neighborhood bar; crowded, rowdy, and LOUDER than a Manowar gig! The hockey game just sent the folks through the roof.  Everyone was really friendly though. I had people I didn't know patting me on the back asking me how I was and all.  \"Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your naaame, and you're always glad you caaaame..\"   I dug that.   The barmaids were pretty foxy too.  Hey, I can't help that I like curvy 30-40 something chicks in tight jeans.   I wasn't hungry at all due to the Italian food and ice cream I consumed earlier in this rainy evening, but my date's sister had eyes bigger than her teeny-tiny waist, so she asked me to eat the other half of her hot sausage sandwich.  \"Oh come on. You can eat it! It'll go to waste!\"  Me the human garbage disposal. Can't finish your dinner? Give it to Darren. He'll eat it.    I'm glad I had some room for it, as it was one of the best hot sausage sandwiches I have ever eaten. The cheese, spices, onions, peppers...oh no...  Ginger ale: My savior. It settles the stomach better than Alka Seltzer, and it was served in a gorgeous, gigantic Coca-Cola glass with a little straw with a knowing smile and nod. The menu is rather huge and includes pizza, burgers, sandwiches, salads, pasta, wings, and anything else a bar might serve.   What a Saturday night! What a well-hidden secret!   It's right across the street from that wacky Zombo Gallery also. It's too bad they were closed. At least I know where it is now in case I ever want to go.  Guy Fieri needs to come here during a Steeler game! Can you imagine what great TV what would make?  Stinky's. That's Pittsburgh. Personified."}
{"text":"I went to Stinky's for wing night and it was fantastic! Came in with 5 people and sat down immediately. The wing night special was great, only 60 cents per wing, with a ton of different sauces and not a long wait time. The service is quick and kind. Even though it calls itself a dive bar, the interior is very clean and fresh looking and smoking is limited to the front of the restaurant near the bar, which is separated from the back seating area. This place is the best-kept secret in Lawrenceville!"}
{"text":"Best bar food you'll find anywhere. Kindest and most friendly wait staff around. We LOVE Stinkys"}
{"text":"Good food...fair prices....it's nice that there are smoking areas and non smoking areas."}
{"text":"So, I walked in the door. Absolutely the most amazing corner bar feeling. The bar tenders, Val and Meagan are OUTSTANDING. If you are in this area, a must visit! So May beers to choose from, incredible menu. I did not have any food , but the couple next to me said A+."}
{"text":"Service is always friendly and prompt. The only downside to here is that I always leave smelling like an ashtray if I sit in the bar area, so plan accordingly if you don't like the smell of smoke. The regular seating area is separated completely from the bar though, so it isn't a huge deal. Drinks are cheap and there's always some sort of beer special going on.   Love coming here for the 60 cent wing deal! Their wings are some of the best that I've had in Pittsburgh. The awesome sauce is my favorite, although I've never had a sauce that I didn't like here. I also really enjoyed their codfather fish sandwich - it was gigantic! I've also heard great things about their burgers but haven't gotten around to trying them yet.   Definitely a great place to stop in for some cheap food and beer!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Stinky's last evening on a recommendation of a friend. Meh recommended the Codfather fish sandwich and  The Harp.  The harp is like a Philly Cheese Steak.   Our party ordered both of these and yes they are very good.  The Stinky chips are thin and crisp.  Very good.  Ok, here comes the BUT.  it isn't call Stinky for no reason.  The odor of disinfectant  was extremely strong.  Even after being inside for 20 minutes the smell still burned the nose.  If you can get past this the food is good."}
{"text":"Been here twice to attend advertised Karaoke only to find out, sadly, they weren't having it.  Recommend calling ahead first if anticipating a night of belting out your fav tunes!"}
