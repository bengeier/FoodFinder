{"text":"Went here for lunch spur of the moment after seeing how long the wait was at Olive and Gourmando across the street. Pleasantly surprised. The offerings are simple, healthy, and beautifully presented . I had the piri piri chicken salad. Atmosphere is typically charming of old town Montreal: exposed brick, low ceilings, and a bit dark. Great lunch option in a very busy part of town."}
{"text":"amazing place!  great decor and service and absolutely wonderful food.  hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Excellent service, good suggestions by the waiter. Food was simple, delicious and filling. Adorable restaurant ambiance too. Kids and adults enjoyed poutine, octopus, piri piri chicken and salad.  Portuguese wine was awesome! A great place on a very chilly evening."}
{"text":"Food was good. Actually the chicken was fantastic. But the customer service wasn't great. We felt like we weren't wanted, like we were a bother to the waitress."}
{"text":"I mean... okay. So the chicken thigh was cooked fine, it was juicy, delicious, and the side salad was over dressed in vinegar (as in the style of Portuguese salads to cut the taste of the fat / oil), and the fries were super salted (again, very Portuguese)... but it just that.  There was nothing WRONG per se, but it was not a place that I would be dying to come back to (unlike Helena with their $24 lunch menu that has an appetizer, meal and dessert - well worth the value)...   It just wasn't really worth it value-wise, but I also couldn't complain because they are in Old Montreal and if you went to Little Portugal, you would get FAR MORE at Rotisserie Romados for less money..... but again, not terrible. Just not a fabulous value for what you are getting in the end.  If it was half a chicken for $12, now we're talking... or if they served rice instead of fries which I will never take again (ugh salt monster..)..  I'd come here again, but only if others wanted to try it.  I'll give their other stuff a shot -- calamari, etc before really deciding."}
{"text":"NOT a great experience. I thought at first I was being nit picky, but it got worse. The waitress was very standoff-ish and not friendly. She asked for my drink order and, since it was my first time dining there, I asked what they had. She replies, \"well what do you want?\" in a way that came off snotty. I ordered and had to ask for water even though other tables were getting it upon being seated.  I ordered the poucine and it took so long to come that I considered asking for my check and leaving. It was about 2:00 in the afternoon on a weekday so it was not busy at all. Maybe 3-4 other diners were in there. The first few bites were good and I thought it was worth the long wait. But as I got more into the dish, the fries underneath were mush and so salty they were almost inedible.  My waitress never came to check on me. Not once. I hadn't seen her since I placed my order and I honestly forgot what she looked like. One girl there was setting tables and she was kind. She smiled at me as she walked by and got my check for me after I'd been sitting there for a while, clearly finished with my meal. I placed my bill down and a man came from behind and took it without saying a word. He put my change down and left. Again, maybe I'm being nit picky, but I expect staff to be at least a little friendly and engaging. I left barely more than a dollar as tip because I felt I'd received no actual service. Instead of having a great first experience, I was left feeling like I'd bothered them by choosing to eat there. Overall, mediocre food and terrible service. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch - cute place and the service was speedy and attentive. Lots of great Portuguese options, but palatable for our visiting American tastes. I had the fried chicken and it was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Hit or Miss 4 different visits - ordered the Piri Piri chicken sandwich with 50/50 fries/salad. First off - go for full on fries, they are very good - the salad is so miniscule and wilted.   As for the sandwich - there's no consistenxy on the quantity you may end up with in terms of chicken and how well it may be cooked.  At the top of my experiences the meat was big chunks, well charred and seasoned - on my last visit it was as miniscule slivers of unchared breast with little flavour - the sandwich was more mayo than anything.  Waiter was only concerned if we'd order or not drinks - perhaps because we opted not to - all went downhill from there - other client meals seemed fine (with beers or wine). The natas are amazing but overpriced at 3$ - simply go next door. Unfortunate."}
{"text":"Walking around clueless with the people I'm with... they never know where to go and come up with dopey ideas all the time.  Somehow we separated from the herd of zombie tourists on the main craphole street of old Montreal and found Teberna and we meandered in.  Glad we did!  The peri peri chicken was awesome.  Tender, tasty and crispy skin with this awesome red not-too-spicy pepper sauce.  I grill half chickens all the time at home and they never come out like this.  I would give it 5 stars but somehow the people that work there f$&ked up the beer order and they didn't have any.  Common man!  No beer!???  I would've eaten there every night but the nitwit people I'm traveling with have something against good food and like to walk around tourist traps aimlessly."}
{"text":"Euh comment dire ??? J'adorai ce restaurant mais ça c'était avant !!!   Rien à dire sur le poulet portugais qui est toujours aussi bon mais le service est déplorable, je m'explique.. nous sommes arrivé à 5 pour le lunch du midi avec des collègues et nous avons attendu énormément pour qu'on vienne nous prendre notre commande, nous avons également attendu plus d'une heure (non non ce n'est pas une blague) pour être servi et qu'au final nous ayons pas ce que nous avons commandé parce \" qu'il y a plus de cuisse de poulet \". Pourquoi ne pas nous avoir prévenu lors de la commande ? Ou en revenant de la cuisine ? Telle est la question !   Il n'y avait pourtant pas grand monde ce jour là !   Le pire reste au moment de payer et de donner les pourboires.   Avec mes collègues nous laissons un pourboire de 15% qui est le minimum car nous ne voulions pas mettre plus avec le service déplorable que nous avons eu (déjà qu'on en a mis c'est déjà bien!) et la serveuse se plaint car nous lui avons donné des pièces et nous dit de les reprendre car cela ne servait à rien (les dites pièces) !  Elle s'attendait à ce qu'on paye par carte et qu'on donne le pourboire par carte également alors je suis désolé mais d'une je suis très mécontente du service et de deux qu'on nous parle de cette manière alors qu'on lui donne un pourboire est inacceptable !   Un conseil si vous aimez ce restaurant, commandez à emportez et ne laissez pas de pourboire si vous payer en espèces car \" cela les ennuient \" apparemment..."}
{"text":"Sister restaurant to Helena, with an interesting list of Portuguese wine, this restaurants has a full menu of Portuguese comfort food in a comfy and trendy atmosphere and excellent service. Located in old port close to McGill street, we had great time in this restaurant and found the service impeccable"}
{"text":"I'd like to start by saying that I'm Portuguese... so I guess my standards were a tiny bit higher then average. people that rated this more then 3 stars for sure never had Portuguese food or are friends of the owner.. the cod fish croquettes were more like potatoes croquettes and the meat croquettes were far from being anything that a Portuguese would call a meat croquette, it was more like an over fried battered piece of steak... we ordered soup that was ok and a platter of 20$ cold cuts that was really nothing special. Also had the Prego (steak sandwich )and chicken. The sandwich was greasy and boiled. The chicken dry like no tomorrow. We asked for some kind of sauce for they called Piri piri ( supermarket quality) .. 24 hours later my stomach is still burning... the waiter was nice but service was bad and we kinda felt like we were pushed out the door . Won't go back! Sorry"}
{"text":"We walked into Taberna, a restaurant in Old Montreal, with a friend after an intense yoga class a few nights ago around 8:30 pm; we were hungry and looking for good food.   The venue, with its stone walls, mosaic tilled floors and leather seating, surely felt classy but unpretentious thanks to the warm welcome at the door and polite wait staff. We asked to be seated by the window hoping for some air as it happened to be especially warm indoors; the restaurant had few diners on a Monday night and so we had a choice of tables.   We ordered many items to share from the authentic Portuguese menu including a steak sandwich with fries, grilled sausage, crab croquettes and grilled octopus. The food was well prepared and tasty. Portions were generous and the price is just right for this area on Montreal. We were especially happy with the white selection from the list of mostly Portuguese wines, thanks to our friendly waiter.   Overall, we both enjoyed the laidback feel of the venue and affordable classic menu items; the service was not only friendly but attentive and so, we'd totally return."}
{"text":"Really kind of surprised by the negative reviews on here, because it was definitely not my experience. Great vibe and looking place when walking in the door. Definitely a Mediterranean look while walking into the establishment. Wait staff was attentive and helpful with any questions as to the menu. I had the poutine and soup while I was there. The poutine was simply out of this world fantastic and would order it again in a heartbeat. The mixture of Portuguese sausage and grilled chicken could not be beaten, especially with its added measure of gravy. Would go back in a heartbeat if I was ever in Montreal again."}
{"text":"If you're hungry, on a budget and a one hour lunch break, try Taberna!  The menu's quite simple and you can check it out online first. Make rezos for lunch cause it can get a bit busy. The noise level's somewhat high so you do have to talk a bit louder.   The chicken plates are great no brainer options for only $12. The fries are really, really nice. They're ever so slighty sweet, crisp yet soft, not oily and seasoned just right with salt & pepper. Add ketcup, spicy mayo or hot sauce and you're good to go!!   The salad is simple yet delicious. The vinaigrette is just the right amount of tang and flavor... Makes you want to eat more!   To get the best of both worlds, go for the chicken plus the 50/50 option of salad and fries.   Chicken is very flavorful and slathered in zesty sauce. Both the leg and the breast are juicy and tender so both options are good.  Service speed is quite reasonable, we got in and out in just an hour for lunch!"}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent. My guests enjoyed the poutine while my chicken was perfectly prepared Portuguese style. Very juicy and delicious!"}
{"text":"We ordered the full chicken with fries. My daughter had the steak sandwich with fries. The way they wrap their sandwiches is perfect to grab and go. The don't have outdoor dining but I noticed a lot of people in Montreal just sitting anywhere possible and enjoying their lunch. If the weather is nice, why not."}
{"text":"Taberna was great! The staff was super friendly, especially our waiter and a woman who I think was also a waitress who let me charge my phone in the restaurant. I had the poutine with ham and piri piri chicken which was fresh and delicious. My friend ordered the serrano ham, cod croquette, piri piri chicken sandwich. They have the option of fries on the side of the sandwich, or a salad, or 50/50 (half fries and half salad). However half of the fries was PLENTY so I would definitely recommend the 50/50. Everything was so flavorful and delicious and came out in a very timely manner. I'm not sure why this place has such negative reviews, I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"AVOID AT ALL COST!   I gotta say, the standards have really dropped here. We've been coming to this place since they first opened. Even before they were opened when they had a terrase on the street during F1 week. It's been steadily going down.  When it's good, it's really good. But these days, it's been getting shockingly bad. It's definitely better in the day (perhaps because the owner is around?) but at night, it's a circus. We came one night around 930. The website said it closed at 11 but they told us they were gonna close up after the guests who were already seated had finished. (I wish we could all do that in our jobs) but whatever I thought. Not the end of the world.  Came back 2 days later with a reservation. The contrast was instant. We come about 2-3 times a week for lunch. The day staff for the most part are really nice and pleasant. Not the same at night. Also, unlike in teh day where you have breads and olives/lupini appetizers, there's absolutely nothing at night. Once we ordered, our drinks never came. When I asked the waiter about it, he blamed it on me saying I changed my mind at the end of the order. (I get it, waiters do alot of things and you can get confused and forget) But please, don't start blame customers for your mistake. No big deal anyway. Just a drink.  Then the food.  It came out cold. The fries were stale and so was the meat. Cold. Obviously it got sent back by someone else. My companion's chicken and fries were warm and the usual standard but come on, why would you serve customers old dishes. At least heat it up to mask it?  Honestly, it could just be the lack of quality control at night. I'd perhaps say if you wanted to try this place, maybe go in the day - skip the night. As for me, I think I'll pass for a while. The standards are sadly not the same which is sad. This place used to be one of my favourite places."}
{"text":"It was a busy Saturday night in Old Montreal and there are so many dining choices, it's hard to decide where to go! After walking the streets for a while, we came across this place and finally choose to sit. The only table available we were told was outside on the narrow sidewalk, which was ok with me but I can see how it might be nerve wracking for others.   We were brought water glasses and menus -- limited choices, but we decided to split the whole chicken for two, which came with a side salad and French fries. The chicken was moist and flavorful with the piri piri sauce, very enjoyable. There was a good amount of fries but the salad was so tiny it wasn't shareable. Service was spotty and not exactly friendly, but maybe you're more easily forgotten outside? No dessert for us here for those reasons."}
{"text":"Loved it. Great poutine. Staff was really friendly.  Felt like I stumbled on a secret."}
{"text":"I came here on New Year's Day (observed).  Taberna was one of the few places open.  The inside reminds me of a country kitchen.  Lots of light, barely treated wood, and freshness.    To eat, I had the Piri Piri Frango with frites and a glass of the house white.  The Piri Piri Frango was a piri piri spiced chicken breast topped with spicy mayo on a bun.  The chicken was very tender and well-flavored.  The bread was fresh and chewy.  The frites were well-seasoned (though I wouldn't have minded a side of mayo or mustard with them),  While I ate my sandwich, I was given a bowl of olives in a delicious herb and oil marinade.  The wine was perfectly serviceable, if a little on the small side pour-wise.  Service was perfectly adequate.  I'm glad that the new year's holiday required me to stray from my plans and end up in this spot. Would visit again."}
{"text":"We stopped here after a long morning of site seeing. I had the steak sandwich with a side salad and my friend had chicken with a side salad. The food was delicious! My sandwich had a light but flavorful sauce and the meat was perfectly tender. The 'side salad' was huge and had the best dressing. The service needed some work but we found that was the case at every restaurant we went too in Montreal."}
{"text":"The ambiance in this restaurant is nearly perfect, but that's about it. Food was ok, nothing spectacular, and (this has nothing to do with the rating) there are no options for vegetarian meals unless you only want one of maybe two salads on the menu.  Also, this is not a place to come to drink beer. Taberna has a medium-size list of overpriced wine and average priced cocktails, but they only serve a couple of bland beers. With that being said, the real issue here is the service. As I looked around, trying to get my waiter's attention, I noticed I was not the only one sitting idly at my seat, without an order being taken or, in my case, waiting to pay my check. I think we waited perhaps 20 minutes with check in hand before I finally got the waiter to send another waiter over so I could pay. For a highly rated restaurant, this is not an acceptable level of service. Very disappointed in that respect (and no I don't care how busy you think you are)."}
{"text":"I waited for about 5 minutes and no one talked with me or served me. So i walked out."}
