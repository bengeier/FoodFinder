{"text":"Well, I would review the place had I been able to eat there. This past Sunday at about 12:30  our largish group of people went in and were refused service because church was about to let out and they MAY come there. About 5 families with kids. Took our business and dollars to Olive Garden. THEY were very happy to serve us, and did so very ably, too.  Our group will be in the area again, and we will NOT be eating at Rossini's.  No stars . . . but I had to click on one to post."}
{"text":"If you like chesse you will love his pizza!  They have the best pizza around, thin crust with bubbles and lots of cheese!  There calzone are awesome too! I have eaten there overy 20 times and never had a bad meal and the service is good too."}
{"text":"The food is average.  They have a few items that are just fine, but the pizza is really not that good.  The service is always good and the price is fine, so if you need something quick it's not a bad choice just don't expect much."}
{"text":"Sorry  This is up there with one of the worst Italian  meals I ever ate.  Marinara taste like it was out of a can .  Eggplant parm. Are you kidding??? Service was fast and efficient ! The foods needs a big improvement."}
{"text":"Wow, there are some seriously mixed reviews for Rossini's. Well, to put my two cents in...we have had their large cheese pizza, eggplant parmesan, baked ziti & lasagna. All of which have been very good. Actually, the pizza was the best we've had in years. We order the large cheese pizza with extra extra sauce & extra extra cheese. It's awesome! I don't know what happened to the people who gave this place bad reviews. I'm sorry they had a bad experience, but I've always had a good one! I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Italian food... The Stromboli is to die for."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has an average of 3 stars... it was very good food.  It must be a family owned/run Italian restaurant...that's the feel I got.  I ordered the baked ziti which I f made 1 1/2 more meals out of after dinner that night.  Apparently this is a favorite dish at this place.  My husband ordered the carbonara which was also delicious.  The next test is the marsala, my husband is super picky about his marsala so he'll have to give it a try.  I'll put my $.02 in again after we try that."}
{"text":"We usually get the small cheese pizza to go after we found out just how good it was. The type of cheese they use and the amount that works so well with the small pizza is really really good. I tried the larger pizzas and it didn't taste the same for whatever reason. The baked ziti was really good as was their lasagna but one thing we figured out here was, at least for the pasta dishes, that they all tasted the same to us. Pasta, sauce, and cheese all tasted the same. Not a bad thing except we would have like to have experienced different taste with each dish. The Cheese Cake we had was really good as well. Not to hip on their version of garlic toast either. We will go back as we have been back. It's not bad at all but could be so much better."}
{"text":"The strip of Hwy 74 between Charlotte and Indian Trail is somewhat of a wasteland as far as dining is concerned. Unless you want fast food or a big chain restaurant, there's not a lot to choose from. That's why I consider Rossini's a total oasis!!  Even though it's in a strip mall, Rossini's has a lot of personality. Could the interior use a little sprucing up? Yes. But I'm a big fan of plethora of booths, the fact that there's never a wait. Plus, the chef seems totally legit.  The servers have always been so sweet and kind. And not to mention the food: YUM-O. Last visit I had the Eggplant Parmesan sub with fries. It's probably not the #1 best Eggplant Parm I've had, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I've also had a veggie calzone: unlike some of the other crazy head reviewers... I was perfectly satisfied."}
{"text":"Went here on a tight time schedule one night for dinner.  Was by myself and needed to get a quick bite.  I read other reviews and wanted to try it out.  The place is quaint and has a family feel.  I like that type of place since customer satisfaction is what will give them an edge over trendy spots or chain restaurants.  Price point is very nice for the quality and portion size (two people can be nearly full from one ravioli serving).  The server was right on with the bread and drink refills.  Overall a very nice outing.  Will be back !"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant last night, very bad experience. The salad greens were gritty from not being washed. The waitress said it was the cook's job to wash the greens, took the uneaten salads and threw them in the bus area. My dinner mate had to ask for another salad with clean greens. Waitress brought another salad with unwashed greens full of dirt. It was disgusting. Poor service, dirty food. Will never go back."}
{"text":"The food was so absolutely atrocious that for the first time in 50 years, I could not finish an Italian meal.  When the cashier asked me, \"How was everything?\", I responded, \"I can't remember ever having a meal quite like that in my life!\"  She said, \"Thanks!\" and we both walked out the door laughing our heads off!  At least it was good for a laugh!!"}
{"text":"Maybe my standards aren't as high as Peter's but I liked the food.  I thought the place was quaint and friendly and very family oriented.  You can order a big dish for everyone in the family to share.  The cheesy bread sticks were my favorite part of the meal.  I'm always a sucker for cheesy bread sticks.  I had the pasta with sausage which was very good.  Yes it's kind of hard to mess up pasta, but hey I had a good time."}
{"text":"I would like to update my last review, if I could take all stars away from this place I would.  My wife and I figured we would try this place again since its close by home.  What a mistake, its gotta be up their with one of the worst meals I have had in years.  The lasagna had zero flavor except for the burnt red sauce. I truly think this place thinks italian is a noodle smothered in the cheap bag cheese.  I don't understand how someone can screw up lasagna, cheese ravioli, or chicken parm, but they do.  The chicken parm was like rubber with the breading coming right off which means a frozen precooked piece that was microwaved!  Diner beware, don't waste your time or money.  We both ended up throwing away our takeout after a couple of bites."}
{"text":"This place has been my favorite pizza place for years. Always had a good experience. Until today. I have very high expectations within the food and customer service business, as I've worked it for about 25 years. I moved away from the area for the last couple years and am just moving back around here. I went here with my girls tonight. They wanted a veggie pizza. I asked the waitress what consisted of the veggie pizza and she told me. We didn't like a couple of the veggies on there and asked if we could sub out any. She went and asked the owner and came back to tell us no. I completely understand there can be different prices for different vegetables. I was ok with hearing, if you sub x or y for z, it will be an extra $1.  It was just a flat no. In customer service, you have to be able to bend. You have to cater to the customer in different ways. That was enough for me to say I'll never be back. I'll never give them another $1. If saying no to a veggie sub was that important to them so be it. I got up, tipped the waitress, it wasn't her fault, and I left before ordering. And now, I'll find another favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"Marginal food.  Tables are too close together.  Be prepared to listen to others conversation if you are not fortunate enough to get a booth. Very good service."}
{"text":"Quiet, smallish place for good Italian eats. I've enjoyed their chicken, veal, and eggplant parm. Also really liked their cannolis. This isn't fancy dining, this is way more like grandmas cooking."}
{"text":"I ordered pick up tonight like I've done in several occasions in the past. My wings were burnt so bad they tasted like they were charred. I called and spoke with the manager Jim and he was VERY RUDE. He stated that the black burn came from the seasons they used to marinate them. Even once I told him that they were charred he still over talked me and said that it was seasoning. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"For an \"Italian\" place in North Carolina the food is decent. The bread is basically hamburger rolls with oil and garlic. The entrees are a little more rubbery than most but overall the food is edible and decently priced. Service is less than mediocre as being the only table we had to wait for drinks, bread etc."}
{"text":"In nine years I've never been so wanted to try. . The side of sausage is very good.  It's sweet so my favorite. It was hot in here not sure if ac was on but I sat sweating. Their marinara sauce is ok sweet which I like not salty and not over powering so not bad. I love the grated cheese they use. The eggplant was fresh not packaged but a little thicker and softer than I like but good flavor in that you could definitely taste the eggplant. I like Angeles Italian best. My mom soaks eggplant in salt water to lighten the bite taste to it. It's a little more work but good result in flavor. Slicing thin breaded in egg and bread crumbs and deep fried in olive oil. Crisp Siciliana is best lol. I wouldn't say don't go here that isn't fair but there are other places for the same cost or less with better Italian. I would try other dishes here to do a better review. I.e chicken marsala. And the pizza. You get good service and good food but Italians from up north have a different palate. So again not a bad place. The bread is toasted and light. Good in my book I don't like heavy bread. Nice snack ahead of your meal and they have beer and wine."}
{"text":"This was my worst experience I can remember. Went here 10/2010 on a Friday night. The place wasn't busy. We ordered an appetizer, a pasta plate and a small pizza. The waitress said she would put the order in for the appetizer then wait 5min on the entrees. Great. We got the appetizer very quickly. It wasn't bad. Then over the next 20min. our waitress asked us three times how everything was and that our entrees would be out shortly. They never arrived. She then apologized and asked if we wanted some bread (to hold us over?). About 5min after that my pasta dish arrived. However, no pizza. That \"would be a few minutes\". Huh? It took another 5-10min for my friends pizza. My pasta dish tasted horrible and my friends pizza was undercooked. In the end I paid $15.50 for a soda, an appetizer and bowl full of pasta that I didn't eat. At least the appetizer was OK. Not only was the service horrendous the food was terrible."}
{"text":"Great Greek chicken salad and the service is terrific. Can't wait to go back and try something else!!"}
{"text":"Rossini's Italian Restaurant is not an Italian restaurant, it's a Greek restaurant! I should have walked out immediately when I noticed that greek salad was on the menu. Although they have pictures of NY in the restaurant, no one in the restaurant is even from NY. ??? I ordered the baked ziti and took one for the team in the rear end. It was soup pasta as I remember. Melted cheese [ not even close to being baked ] with pasta and a soup of sauce, if you even call it that. God awful. Never again."}
{"text":"Upon arriving, it was pretty steady so we had a small wait. The hostess was very friendly and even kept updating on our wait time.  We got sat. Our waitress walked over and the first thing out of her mouth was \"need menus?\" Um, well let me just guess what you have to eat here. Of course we need menus. She takes our order, two large pizzas, two orders of mozzarella sticks, cheese fries, wings and two chicken Alfredo's. Over $130 in food and drinks. One chicken alfredo came out with a hair in it, other was just bland and terribly tasting. We sent both back after one bite. Other food was tasty! Got our bills and to our surprise the pasta meals were still on there at 14.95 each. We asked the server to please speak to the manager about this incident and she came back promptly with the answer that he wasn't going to take it off or do anything about it. We finally decided to go to him face to face and turns out he's the owner and not just a manager. He finally took them off. We will never be back. This place is a bad business."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" at best. The food wasn't made to order, and we could tell. It wasn't terrible, but it was pricey for what it was. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Unfortunatley our first visit here will be our last. The outside of the place had us fooled because it is well kept but inside is very dingey, with wait staff in dingy tshirts. They gave us what look like cut rolls from a deli made to look like garlic bread for the table with no plates so eat them over just the table so crumbs would be everywhere. Then as we were eating my father cutting his lasagna realized the whole piece of lasagna was still wrapped in plastic wrap from the freezer it came out of!! The whole piece was defrosted and cooked with it on and the cook just layered mozzarella and additional sauce on it. I kid you not!! I understand mistakes happen but this was just crazy. The owner apologized and waived his meal and 4 beers, but it wont be enough to bring us back in."}
{"text":"We came in here after an ice hockey game from the Extreme Ice Center right down the road.  Upon entering we noticed there was one couple in the restaurant (two people), that was it.  We came in as two people but could have had up to 30 people patronize the small uncrowded restaurant.  When asked how many people I said it could be between 2 and 20 people. I asked where we could sit and expand to in case we needed too as the kids like to sit together.  The waitress said, \"sit anywhere you want, we aren't crowded\".    The owner apparently had other ideas.  He came over and very unprofessionally stated that he needed the other seats for the Saturday night rush.  Keep in mind this was 4:30pm in the afternoon and we were taking up two tables at the time for 6 people?  Here we were trying to spend money in his place and he wanted to save seats for other people, I didn't understand.  I immediately sent out a text to the team to NOT come to Rossini's as the owner doesn't want our business.  At least 7 families went elsewhere.  His tone and the fact he kept staring at us the entire time enraged me but I kept my cool.  I felt very un-welcomed.  On the positive side the waitress was extremely nice and seemed embarrassed by the owner's actions.  The kids said the food was good.(we only stayed for the kids).  I ended up eating at Cook-Out down the street as I wasn't going to give this man anymore of my money.  Needless to say we will not be back and we will let the ice rink and the organizers of upcoming ice hockey tournaments know that the teams are not welcomed in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The supreme pizza was very soggy. We asked if that was normal and they said yes due to the veggies. Will not go back for pizza as it was also pricey for pizza we didn't like."}
{"text":"Not too far from home, and one of the few places we haven't tried, so we decided to stop in for a visit. I'm not typically a fan of eating Italian, because many of the dishes can be made with relative ease (and pretty easily on the pocketbook to boot) at home. But some nights you just have to give it a go.  In this case, the service is spot-on, though the atmosphere may be a bit lacking - nothing particularly bad about it, just nothing that really stands out that makes you want to think good thoughts.  The food is in much the same boat. Perfectly workable, but nothing monumental or that would make you think you need to go back anytime soon, however if you're in the area and don't feel like cooking, it could do in a pinch - especially if you feel like a little dash of Greek with your Italian."}
{"text":"While this is a small restaurant, I love this place. This is not a fancy restaurant, and it's laid-back and the food can be deemed mediocre by some. My kids (picky teens now), love the calamari and the option to choose their noodles and sauce. Very affordable, and the staff has always been wonderful. The outdoor eating area is really nice! Very spacious. It can get a bit loud during traffic hours, but that is minor. They offer a great selection of subs and salads as well. The owners are very sweet. The older gentleman who typically works the lunch shift is very sweet. Very good wine selection to boot. If you are looking for \"fancy,\" go elsewhere. Oh - my favorites are the baked ziti and eggplant parmigiana."}
{"text":"My first time here and was pleasantly surprised. Service was good. Dad ordered a pizza that tasted excellent.  I had white fish special and it was very tasty. I wasn't thrilled with the salad but overall was pleased. I'll go back and try again."}
{"text":"My family and I have been dining at Rossini's Restaurant from when they first opened.  We love is having a restaurant that serves fresh home-made good food rather than the fast food chains everywhere in Indian Trail. Jim uses fresh vegetables, olive oil and great selection of spices and will not over-salt.  Customers can salt as they want.  To me that's very considerate and caring being some of our family members are elderly and cannot consume a lot of salts.  Never have we had a bad meal or bad  experience with the staff. The Pizza is PHENOMENAL!!!! It bothers me that some write bad reviews only to have gone once and not give a small family owned restaurant a second chance.  You people need to stick with your McDonald's and Bojangles.  Thanks Jim for caring! Chanteau"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Everything is fresh and made to order by Danny. A great girls night, date night or dinner with friends.  Homemade everyday Greek dressing...to die for!!!  Have never ordered anything I didn't love.    Sat outside on the patio at sunset, fans overhead, twinkling lights surrounding us for 4 hours. Excellent service and we didn't feel like \"campers\", although we were!!  A great night with friends."}
{"text":"Great service from Tara, and excellent homemade tiramisu!! We will definitely come back and sit outside with a view of the beautiful sunset!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a Calzone that can feed you, and probably others, for days, you have found a prime location.  My family went bowling, and needed a place to eat afterwards.  they easily accommodated our group of 7 on the spot.  We all had either salads, or split the large Calzone or Stromboli.  The cheese is delicious, and my family takes cheese very seriously.  I also like that this place is right on the way between work and home and is easy to get to from the highway.    Overall, a great family, Italian experience!"}
{"text":"Pizza dough was the best I've had since moving down here three years ago!  The pasta and meatballs were very good also. Service was excellent...shout out to Bo for doing a great job. Oh yeah, I almost forgot about dessert. Cannoli was da bomb."}
{"text":"Tried this place out this evening and LOVED it! I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and it was so good! The pasta was cooked to perfection and the meatballs reminded me of the ones my Italian mother-in-law use to make. The sauce was yummy and I could taste that they are using fresh ingredients. For dessert, I tried the cannoli and it was delicious. We ordered a pizza to go just so we could try it and we were not disappointed! The cheese was so fresh and tasty and the crust was fantastic! Our server, Bo, was excellent. Being that this was our first visit, we asked him quite a few questions about different menu items and he explained everything perfectly! They have a charming dining patio with romantic twinkle lights around it and if it hadn't been cold and rainy, we would have dined outside."}
{"text":"Rossini's has been on my radar for a while and it's a pretty solid go-to as far as mom & pop Italian.  It's located at the end of a strip mall off of Independence on your way to Monroe (Indian Trail-Fairview Rd & 74).  Just hate that its a bit far from Charlotte, but I think it's worth the drive - also if you are in the area, I would think it as a good option for both lunch and dinner.  It has a small dining room, but I am sure they do take-out as well.  On our last particular visit, the hostess wasn't at her station, so I believe the chef actually showed us to our table and wished us a nice lunch.  The waitress/hostess was super friendly and took good care of us.  There are daily specials in addition to the menu, but everything I've had here is great, and you definitely get a ton of food.  The only thing I haven't tried are their subs, which look fairly good as well.  Probably a lot of folks will be looking for \"authentic\" Italian, but I think they have a good thing going here as far as Italian made with heart.  You may not be transported to the boot-shaped country, but you will taste it's flavors with an Indian-Trail twist."}
