{"text":"Customer service doesn't exist at this place. You stand at the front entrance not knowing if you sit yourself or will the wait staff come to you. We sat ourselves. It was a 20-30 minute wait  for the food to come and it wasn't even busy. We were there at 1pm. Of course, the edamame is an appetizer, but it was delivered with the rest of the meal. This was my second try with them and it just solidify that this place sucks all around! I ordered the Pad Thai (not soup), they threw in some boiled shrimps and a few sprig of beansprouts. The edamame had some sort of oil saturated coating. How can you mess up cooking a plane and simple vegetable. I will never, ever recommend or dine in this place again."}
{"text":"Just came home with five orders of Pho and few apps..Called in at 7 pm. Told me 15 min to get picked up. Got there and waited until 745. Didn't mind the wait, cool place.  Problem is when I got home. Who puts Noodle in the hot broth on a to go order? Noodles are so soggy and nasty that I can only eat with spoon. Gave two stars because apps were decent. Pho had good flavor but ruined because of soggy noodles."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first experience at Red Thai. My party had the potstickers, pad thai (extra spicy), yellow curryand the beef pho. All were tasty. I especially enjoyed the pho, which had a rich beef flavor and the thai iced tea martini.  The service was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and the place is really cool inside.  The prices are extremely reasonable.  I'm looking forward to trying lunch and happy hour there as well.  Bottom line, I will be back.  If after a few visits, the food is just as delicious,  I will up to 5 stars.  Check it out."}
{"text":"This place is between so and so to good-depending on the service. I enjoy the food and service is usually good. The bartender had mediocre service compared to the waiters who served me in the past. It wasn't by all means terrible, but he seemed to pay closer attention to others (they'd probably tipped him well in the past) that were sitting in the center of the bar.  Other than that, the food is really good and the atmosphere is really nice."}
{"text":"Stepping into Red Thai was a most pleasant transition to upbeat, delightfull, Fabulous food and ambience.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Pad Thai is horrible!!! It was Watery and sweet like pineapple juice and noodles slopped in a bowl. We order a dessert and asked for the strawberry purée on the side and we were told \"no\" we had to have the strawberry sauce. The waiter then asked the manager to make an exception to this rule and she refused and said if they don't put the strawberry purée on the top the \"dough\" might get hard. Hmmmm...obviously they don't know how to make the dessert. Skip this place and try Reign of Thai instead!"}
{"text":"I went last Saturday to have a late lunch in the early afternoon. The restaurant was relatively empty with only few customers. I ordered chicken pad thai and the meal did not resemble typical pad thai I usually got from other thai restaurants. It was watery and disgusting. On top of that the chicken was not thoroughly cooked and I have the proof (PICTURE). I told the server that I can't eat this because the chicken was not cooked. He then asked if I wanted to order something else and I decided to have the same meal my husband ordered beef basil. I made a bad choice, I should have sampled prior ordering! The meal was as bad as the chicken pad thai. It was salty and beef was hard to chew on.  I was utterly disappointed. I do not blame the workers but I blame the management. They do not provide enough training for the cook to ensure food quality and SAFETY are properly maintained (HELLO UNDERCOOKED CHICKEN). What really irritates me the most I was charged for UNDERCOOKED chicken pad thai (my husband should have reviewed the bill before make a payment). I disputed the bill which then the server refunded our money and made us make another payment with the correct check.The server did apologize but I did not feel like it was a genuine apology.  There were tons of 'hiccups' and 'surprises' dining in this place.  Servers are the nerve center of the business and they should be more attentive to customers' needs, be more observant and deliver a genuine care. Again this is management problem. Management should have trained its workers to meet with the standard of exceptional quality of customer service. I will not return until you fix the system in your restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wow! I was shocked by everything we ordered.  It was all way more than I expected.  My wife and I started with the truffle edamame and the spring rolls. Delicious! Very fresh! Then we got the pad Thai with shrimp and pho.  I couldn't believe how good it was! You would never know driving up. It's in kind of a crappy strip mall tucked in the back, but hey that's usually where you find the best places to eat.  Our server Taylor was great and very helpful.  I would and will recommend this place to anyone looking for some great Asian cuisine.  And by the way, 2 drinks 2 apps and 2 entrees..... Only $45!!!! We will be back!! Often!"}
{"text":"Very tasty. I was also surprised by the vibe inside. The decor was chic, modern, and fun with a tasteful dj playing a variety of music. Come check it out, we will be back for sure. Great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Eek! Me thinks not. The lady bartender was so rude....we left."}
{"text":"Red Thai in Phoenix is soooooo tasty!! The atmosphere is really unique in an impressive and fun way. Perfect place to hit the town with friends and family. The soups are addictive. The owner consistently interacts with guests for feedback. Staff is friendly and has a family meal together at the end of the evening, which somehow makes the place even better."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior, great staff, and  the owner makes you feel very welcome.  We went for happy hour, which is an awesome deal, 5.00 appetizers and drinks. We had the Ginger pork, Almond chicken, and edamame.   All were delicious and I will be going back to try the full menu. Hope this restaurant stays open a great many years."}
{"text":"This is a place where not easting at the bar would be a mistake, in my opinion. Cool bar, good drinks and a good beer selection. Happy hour is a good value too. I ate the Red Curry and it was very good. I didn't tell them how hot I wanted it (nor did they ask) and it was pleasantly spicy, which I appreciated.   I have read some reviews that claim that this restaurant does not fit in with the rest of the shopping center. In fact, one reviewer wrote that they are \"trying to be something they are not\" due to it being next to a dollar store and a (outstanding) hardware store. I say, \"Good\"! They are pulling the area up instead of sinking to its level.   I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food and service is amazing.   Sit at the bar and have Chris Heflin serve you.   Fun friendly and a great bartender,  oh yah  pretty hot too. Happy hour special is perfect.  Try the crispy noodle island wow.  Linda is by far the best.  We love her.  Thank you for having red thai in the hood"}
{"text":"While I would give this place 5 stars for food/happy hour(try a martini), the service was not the greatest. I've been a couple times for happy hour and our bartender the first time(guy) was very friendly and knowledgeable. The second time however, the bartender(girl) acted like we were an inconvenience. She took a while to take our order despite being one of the only groups in the bar area then didn't ask if we wanted to order food or another drink. She took down the happy hour menus 15 before happy hour was over...as people were walking in and sitting at the bar. The hostess should wear a little more clothing and act somewhat happy to be there...I mean, she is greating people. I look forward to trying this place again, hopefully will have a better experience..  *side note- they really need to clean the Windows!"}
{"text":"From the good music, great food, and amazing service. I will only go to red Thai when I want Thai food. The atmosphere and Katherine our waitress made it a great Friday night.  Closed the place down!!!"}
{"text":"Sad to say my first experience here was not good. Always looking for good restaurants in the area.  Ordered carry out, they forgot to put rice in bag for order.  Ordered  House Dynamite with chicken--chicken extremely dry, didn't even eat it-- it was that bad. One friend ordered 1/2 chicken appetizer--she wasn't happy either.   However, my friend who ordered soup said her soup was good, so maybe okay if you stick with the soup."}
{"text":"WORST service, snobby waiters, chef who refuses substitutions and NO brown rice. So disappointed."}
{"text":"A dining experience isn't just about the food, or drink for that matter.  Step across the threshold into Red Thai, and you are transported from the reality of life into another dimension. The colors, the lighting, the images all contribute to  the foreshadowing of a culinary experience that will bring you back time and again. This transformation is complete once the sun sets. The Asian Fushion menu gives plenty of choices for newcomers to this  genre of taste and to those who find this fare one of their favorites. Spicy? Done. Not spicy? Done.  Diners don't have to ask if they can have chicken instead of beef for example. It is covered by the \"protein choices\" as stated on the menu. Looking to go somewhere with a date for the first time, where it is soothing enough to talk but enough distractions to cover awkward moments? Done. Want a place to go with friends to enjoy good food, good background music and an interesting drink menu? Done.  When you walk back across the threshold to the real world, you leave satisfied, not just from an epicurean perspective, but with your other senses satisfied as well."}
{"text":"I like my food,especially southeast Asian food to be hot and thank goodness this is one of the few places I've been to where the dishes that say they are spicy actually have a good burn to them.  It's nothing outlandish but you do start to sweat and feel the spices in dishes like the hot and sour soup.  I can't keep track of the number of thai, vietnamese, mexican, indian, chinese, you name it restaurants where I order a \"spicy\" dish and I'm left disappointed in the heat level.  They put a unique twist on a lot of dishes which I appreciate.  The hot and sour soup was like no other hot and sour soup I've had and they sometimes even warn you when you order the Pad Thai that it isn't going to be exactly like the dozen's of pad thai you can find in any restaurant here in Phoenix.   The Anime behind the bar can definitely lead to some amusing conversations..."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place going to one of the stores in the mall area and glad we did. Wow! All I can say is wow! The food here is extremely good. My GF and I came here for the Happy Hour and we were not disappointed. Being purveyors of Thai food we wanted to see what this place had to offer and were not disappointed. We came here and you cannot find a better HH in the area. The appetizers were $5 and needless to say we ordered them all. We wanted the full Red Thai experience and it was WOW! The best item (again for $5) was the Sugar Cane Pork! Unbelievable pork wrapped around sugar canes and coated with a crispy sauce over the pork! Wow! The other dishes were just as good! You need to try the sauces mixed with them which really highlighted the appetizers. The BEST! We did come early in the day (HH is 3-6) and few customers but the staff very helpful and knowledgeable. Kudos to the bartenders Jeremy and Jillian who were very personable and professional. One final note is the bar. It is very long and the TV screen which is the back of the bar area (which is huge) shows sporting events and anime if you are into that. It's awesome! I highly recommend this business. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place smelled absolutely like pee throughout the restaurant and the music was horrible. The food took forever to get to the table and the place wasn't even busy along with the rice coming out of a can. Make your own damn food."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite restaurant. Period. The coconut shrimp is to die for. The martinis were perfect when Jeremy was the bartender. He is gone and his recepies do NOT live on. The music blaring was pounding techno. We asked to lower the volume, but the DJ only tweaked it one decible. This was at 5 PM.  Johnny Chu the chef/owner is making a big misake as this restaurant caters to an older crowd to a large extent. I will not return and am sad and hope the owner reads this review.  Loud repetive music is fine for bars and disco but not for a fine dining establishment."}
{"text":"Red Thai chicken and rice is the real deal!! Get the edamame with truffle oil. So Flippin tasty."}
{"text":"So the food here is amazing. Love the lemongrass soup and spring rolls.  Ambiance is also great.   Would give it five stars but the service always leaves something to be desired.  Staff are inflexible and not able to accommodate requests to dishes.  We brought our 3 year old and they were not willing to order any accommodations to their menu (leaving the wings naked instead of with sauce). That part is annoying.   Tonight called for take out and was put on hold for 7 mins. Hung up and called back- took my order immediately."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant and bar in Phoenix. It's a unique place and such a hidden gem. The service is always amazing and it's great for big groups. They even have a dj that plays swanky music on the weekends. Perfect place for a romantic date or to grab drinks with your friends! Also if you're a vegetarian this place has amazing options and delicious tofu."}
{"text":"Where to begin. Walking in is almost overwhelming (in a good way)- very cool! Anime playing on the wall behind bar running the length of the restaurant, a huge mural painting on the back wall, buddha statue at the entrance. Who knew such a hip restaurant could be in our neighborhood in this little strip mall?!  The food lived up to how awesome the restaurant looks. We had the egg rolls, spring rolls, chicken lollipops and the pad thai. Everything was on point. The egg rolls are mini which makes them very crisp and tasty. The shrimp spring rolls were very fresh and the pad thai was done very well without being greasy at all. My favorite, though, were the chicken lollipops. They are what I would call sophisticated chicken wings. Sweet but not too sweet, some spice, really good quality chicken, and just a little messy.  We will be back and I hope everyone in the neighborhood supports this place because it's a true gem."}
{"text":"Busy, upbeat atmosphere and good asian fusion menu. Fresh and served at the right temperature for the food being served.  Will do again!"}
{"text":"I had hoped to set my taste buds tingling with a nice spicy Thai dish.  I ordered duck with kumquat sauce.  I ordered it extra hot hoping to get a nice blend of heat and sweet.  As I've come to expect from an upscale Thai restaurant, the dish heat level ranked 0 on my heat scale.  It was still tasty despite have 0 heat.  I would probably return to try some of the other dishes.    I did see on my receipt that rice was actually an extra $1.50.  I don't recall seeing anything on the menu that mentioned this.  I'm not sure why upscale restaurants like to hit you with up a-la carte style pricing when their hole in the wall cousins make equally tasty if not tastier dishes and give you free rice.  I'm pretty sure that the $3.40 profit on the $3.50 soda more than makes up for the $.05 worth of rice.  If they wanted $1.50 for the rice, then they should bump up the price of the dish by $1.50 and provide \"free\" rice.  Be sure to have enough room on your credit card since this place isn't cheap."}
{"text":"A new favorite place!  Fresh food and reasonable prices are strong points.  We've been to RedThai twice in four days and can't wait to explore their menu further.  Dining area is open and nice, but not off-putting fancy.  Prices are in the $10-20 range, though the Pho is under $10.  We've had a variety of appetizers, entrees and drinks and each tasted very fresh and delicious.  We've had pork pot stickers, shrimp spring rolls, a ginger fish dish, a chicken basil dish, beef Pho and tofu Pad Thai.  All are recommended."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Excellent service. Pad Thai was the best I've ever had. Spring rolls were incredible. All of the soups that my group had were amazing. Fantastic dining experience."}
{"text":"You might say that we're always ready to \"Thai\" one on! You know, take a \"wok\" on the wild side! One of our favorite places that features a mélange of tempting tastes from the mystic Orient is Johnny Chu's popular Sochu House on Central Avenue and Thomas Road. He's expanded, and now you can try his newest venture, Red Thai, a clever little bistro featuring an Asian fusion menu with the emphasis on Thai and Vietnamese cuisine. You'll find Red Thai in a thriving strip mall at the southwest corner of 12th Street and Northern Avenue.   Some tried and true crowd pleasing favorites from Sochu House found their way into the menu here, like the Sugar Cane Pork with \"the other white meat\" marinated in ginger lemongrass panko with pineapple ginger sauce, skewered with a small stick of sugar cane for $7.98. A new kid on the wok, errrr, \"block,\" is the Almond Chicken, where the nut coated bird is flash fried and served with spicy sweet sour dipping sauces. Two nicely sized skewers are $7.98. The menu denotes that the Orange Puff, a crusted white meat chicken in a spicy tomato sauce ad topped with orange zest is \"spicy,\" but we didn't agree. More spice. More orange zest.   \"Salad\" territory gives you six different ones from which to choose. The Bun Bo is a spicy bowl of stir fry onion and beef, cucumber, bean sprouts with spicy nuoc cham (a delicious fish sauce) and topped with peanuts and crisp shallots for $9.98. What the menu didn't tell us is that this is on a bed of cold rice noodles. We couldn't help but wish that there were more crunchy, fresh, crispy bean sprouts (we barely found any). There's potential for this, but the cold rice noodles didn't work for us. Sorry! Please turn up the spice on this one!  A big hit was the amazing Green Papaya Salad. Choose tofu or shrimp accenting a bowl of shredded green papaya, Asian mint, peanuts with a divine sweet and sour dressing. The fresh, crunch and bite of the julienned papaya along with the breathtaking mint makes this perfect year 'round, but especially for the summer. $8.98  Entrée choices are mouthwatering. Try the Sweet Ginger Fish ($14.98). Crispy (still buttery and tender) white fish is served with snow peas, bell pepper, onion, pineapple and baby corn in a sweet ginger sauce, Kind of a traditional \"sweet & sour\" but the luscious, mild fish gives it a different kind of spin.   Tackle the delicious Crispy Noodle Island ($11.98) with baby bok choy, mushroom, carrot, snow pea, broccoli, baby corn and onions in a brown garlic sauce. You can choose either tofu, shrimp or chicken to grace this dish. The crunchy bed of the crispy noodles\" will give you plenty to work on.   Nine other entrées round out the menu. Fans of Pad Thai will enjoy this super spicy dish for $11.98. An outstanding bonus at Red Thai are the many vegetarian options along with a few gluten free choices, too. These requirements can make dining out with a few guests a challenge if they have dietary requirements or restrictions.   A highlight of the Red Thai experience is the jewel-like space, featuring a 70-foot long bar with a gold, glittering portrait of Buddha covering the 20-foot high wall. Behind the enormous bar Japanese animé is projected, creating a fantastical wallpaper that's captivating, yet unobtrusive. A night visit is when this venue shines with the modern Asian theatricality that only Johnny Chu and his wife, Linda Q can do. We look forward to Chu's Shabu Fondue opening next month, with a selection of broths simmered for hours. Think \"Melting Pot\" but without any cheese.  Speaking of the bar, don't deny yourself one (or two. Or three) of their magnificent cocktails. Let that handsome David Ugorowski create something special for you. be careful! You just might find out what one night in Bangkok feels like when you wake up the next morning, so be responsible!"}
{"text":"Great addition to Sunnyslope. Sister restaurant is Sochu House in Central Phoenix.   There are two restaurants within: Red Thai & Shabu Fondue. This review is for Red Thai.   Price: $36 (two dinners & appetizer)  Flavor: Perfection. Mild - request heat.  Seating: Plenty of options, tables, booths and bar is length of restaurant Service: Friendly & quick"}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this place. Very casual with good flavors on the menu. I'm not into anime, but the big screens are kind of cool and mesmerizing. The food is good. Nice fusion of flavors and good choices - not your standard Thai food. Nice selection of cocktails, wine and beer. Service is good."}
{"text":"My first time here and was impressed by the decor and the vibe.  You'd never guess what the place was like from the outside.  The food was good but I was a bit disappointed by how spicy it was.  I had tears flooding from eyes and a runny nose in no time.  I'll admit I'm a bit of a light weight when it comes to spicy but others in my party were not such light weights and agreed that it was HOT HOT HOT.  Every other thai place i've tried in tow will ask how spicy would you like it, but here they didn't ask.  My bad because i didn't even realize the weighted didn't ask when he took my order.  If you like hot and spicy, you'll love this fun funky place."}
{"text":"Do you want authentic Thai? Well, this is not the place. My husband and I are both very disappointed with the food after reading other reviews and seeing it had 4 stars.  There are WAY better Thai options in the valley.   If you don't care about having good Thai and just want to eat in a trendy restaurant with a cool looking bar then this is your place.  Won't be back!"}
{"text":"This place is really awesome.  Every soup is outstanding.  I love all the curry and noodle dishes. Appetizers are excellent (try the sizzling green bean!).  They have options for VEGAN and GLUTEN FREE.  They've accommodated us for other food allergies.    The decor is an open space with rotating local art, booths, tables, and a long bar.  The customers are a diverse crowd, and we love eating and hanging out here.  They do live jazz music every Sunday, they have live DJ's frequently, and otherwise play tasteful lounge dance music.  They project anime onto the walls which makes the place even more colorful and alive.  If there is an important game on they will project that, but this is not a \"sports\" bar.  They also have a live drag show on First Friday's after hours, that was a surprise but I had a good time.  I've eaten at this restaurant countless times, and can highly recommend the food and service to anyone.  Johnny Chu's other spots have been great. He supports the local music and arts scene, so lets support Red Thai... it's amazing."}
{"text":"There was no wait for me because I met a party down there and it was about 4:45 so the place was empty. Sat down, ordered a water and started talking with my friends.  Waiter comes by and I order potstickers and edamame to start with. (my usual apps in any asian restaurant) The waiter says right off the bat, \"There's a $2 sharing fee\" I'm like, \"Seriously? On appetizers?\" He shook his head and laughed, \"No just the entrees.\" This place must really have an issue with that so the staff must be trained to say that but slow your roll, I was just ordering appetizers bruh.  The potstickers weren't anything special...could have fried up some that were from the frozen bag and they would've tasted the same! Hate that they provide an odd number of potstickers. Doesn't make any sense at all and causes nothing by frustration.   The truffle edamame was pretty addicted but, in the end, a little too \"garlicky\" for my taste. It was a big hit for the table so at least none of us were embaressed about garlic breath. :)  I ended up ordering the Crispy Noodle Island. It's a cool concept having crunchy noodles with the veggies and sauce softening the noodles. The problem was that there was too much sauce! Like WAY too much. The menu also failed to mention there were bamboo shoots in them...eww (it's a texture thing) Not quite sure what my boyfriend ordered but he was thrilled about it either.  Best part was dessert! Cream cheese/goat cheese wontons with strawberry sauce! So freakin good!! Loved it!  It's was neat that they were playing anime in the background but I would've really enjoyed if they were able to play some Sailor Moon...especially because it's on Hulu now :3  The price was decent! $40 for 2 apps, 2 entrees, dessert tax and tip! I still wouldn't come back for food but probably drinks and dessert so meh..."}
{"text":"I really love Thai tea. So does my mom. So naturally, on our first and only visit so far, we told waiter-man to ring up two of those!  While we were deciding on what to eat, ONE Thai tea comes to the table.   \"Sorry, this was the last tea. We are all out.\"   Really?? And it's only lunch time? I have never heard of that in my enThaier (see the Thai pun in there?) experience at restaurants. The one saving grace was we were not charged for the single tea.   Onto to the food... My mom's red curry was really good, better than my entree which consisted of WAY too many crispy noodles! And we did share some sweet potato fries that were quite yummy.   The ambiance is interesting, but I had a roommate that was obsessed with anime so it's not really my thing.   Overall, not too bad for a new restaurant, and the vibe can be cool, but wouldn't mark it as a fav."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is worth the price of admission alone. Huge screens playing anime all the time. But if you're here purely for the Thai there are better options. 3.5"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this new restaurant so close to our house, what a complete disappointment it turned out to be! It started out fairly decent and took a very quick turn.  First , the menu they handed me was so dirty it was disgusting to touch it had dried food all over it. Their water tasted like chlorine and they don't have too many options on beverages unless you're drinking alcohol, they don't even have fresh brewed iced tea of any type there. The two female Asian managers or owners were arguing about another customers meal that was sent back because they didn't like it. they then decided to make the people eat those plates anyway... Obviously the other customers refused asked for their check and left abruptly. It was awkward that it happened in front of all of the customers in the restaurant. When ordering food it was very difficult apparently the cook in the kitchen does not like to make any substitutions or eliminate an ingredient if somebody is allergic to it so basically you get whatever he feels like making. I ordered a salad and asked for the dressing on the side because I do not like very much dressing on my salads and apparently nobody is allowed to order their salads like that in the restaurant you have to have the dressing on the salad because apparently it's the only way the salad tastes correct.  It seems the waitress was more interested in pleasing the kitchen cooks then pleasing the customers.  Our orange puff chicken appetizer was totally disgusting and had no flavor at all we did not eat it One of the dishes we ordered came out incorrectly after how strongly the waitress stood by with the cook puts in things it was still wrong. So basically we got an appetizer and two meals we did not eat any of it they did not care they did not offer to take it off of our bill or help us in any kind of way.  I got the vibe that the two Asian managers spend most of their time bad mouthing their customers. I will make sure to never eat at any of the other establishments that this man owns. A truly horrible dining out experience!!"}
{"text":"We Love the amazing food and wonderful staff! The warm truffle edamame is amazing .   We also had almond chicken and sugarcane pork. Those are all on the happy hour menu. A great deal to be had sitting at the bar"}
{"text":"Tonight was my second visit to Red Thai. The first time we were a group of four, and all in all thought our meals were rather good.  The first time I went, I had four course meal for around $30. It included a soup, which was very good, a papaya salad, which was okay, a lemon sorbet as a palate cleanser, and a beef curry. The flavour of the curry was quite good, but a few pieces of my beef had gristle. Overall, our table was pleased with the meal, with the exception of a few points.   So the second time, I came in with a groupon (cause that's how I roll ;) ) figuring we would give it another shot.   My friend and I ordered several dishes to share.  The tom yum soup was really flavourful, with nice hints of lemongrass and cilantro, and quite a few mushrooms. The imperial rolls (meat filled), were quite good, though a bit greasy (which I guess is to be expected).  The grilled calamari ($7) had nice flavour, and was quite spicy with a generous amount of black pepper.  It was slightly tough. For the main meals, we tried the duck with kumquat sauce and the peanut butter shrimp with crispy spinach. We struggled to cut the duck ($ 20) which was very overdone around the edges, but okay in the centre. The sauce was flavourful, and was served with a few sauteed peppers and mushrooms.  The peanut butter shrimp were well cooked, but lacked a bit of oomph. The soup, rolls, and shrimp were part of a table d'hôte ($28), and rice is to be ordered separately.      I really like the decor. Leopard print chairs, dark wood, dim purple and pink-ish lighting, and statues.  The presentation is very nice, as is the serving-ware. The presentation of the dishes is great - everything is served on a variety of nice white and blue patterned dishes. It seems like more focus is placed on presentation and restaurant style than on the preparation of the food. The dishes fall short of the strong flavours you'd find in smaller, cozier Thai places.   Service was efficient and effective (dishes promptly removed, water constantly filled) but wasn't very warm.     While the meal was okay, the quality/value ratio isn't there."}
{"text":"Ambience was great!    I ordered the Pho Ga and it was decent.  Unfortunately, it didn't have vermicelli noodles and not enough broth. The noodles seemed to be pad Thai noodles and they were too thick.   The flavor was good but not great. In all fairness I ordered take out right before closing so they might not have been on top of their game by the end of the night.   I'll return for a drink to watch games with the  projectors and try the Thai food...but not for the Pho."}
{"text":"We love the food here and the ambiance.. The jasmine infused vodka martini is wonderful. Sizzling shrimp was spiced perfectly. Truffle edamame,  enough said. great variety of menu.. Thanks Linda and Johnny.."}
{"text":"The chicken wings and almond chicken were awesome....perfectly paired with a Lucky Buddha"}
{"text":"Date nite Friday nite.  Unusual set up.  The booths are in the middle of the room instead of against the wall.  Giant screen behind bar showed cartoon and patchy artwork on the opposite wall.  If you guys need great art let me know.  I know a great artist.   Ordered sugar cane pork and spring rolls.  Both well prepared fresh and delish.  Then tried thai soup and shrimp stir fry.   Again both delish.  And I'm hard to please and picky when it comes to Asian food.  4 out of 5"}
{"text":"Fun, clean, cute and wonderful Thai fusion food. Cocktails are top of the line and so is the service!"}
{"text":"Yum!  I have to admit I was skeptical with regards to the location -- sandwiched between a 99 cent store and a hardware store, my expectations were not high.  However, once I entered this gem, I dropped all preconceived notions of a strip-mall restaurant and dug in.    The food was excellent, fresh and HUGE.  I enjoyed the tofu spring rolls and the Pho Ga, which I could definitely not finish due to its size, but took it home with me to enjoy for lunch the next day.  The price is definitely right, and I'm sure the happy hour specials are even more impressive.  I am already planning my next visit."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I ordered Bun Bo.  They gave me a rice noodle salad with some pepper beef & onions and not Bun Bo.  It was missing fish sauce, any kind of chiles (and none appeared to be on offer at the place), ginger, lemongrass and lime.  All of the savory, delicious Vietnamese flavors of Bun Bo were totally missing.  So sad!!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Modern decor for sure. The food was excellent. Appetizers, soup and red thai curry. Yum."}
{"text":"BEST THAI IVE EVER HAD!!!!! And I love THAI! We went to this restaurant for my sisters birthday. She loved Sochu House and was sad when it closed but we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  Service- Our waitress was amazing! She rocked it with our large party. The chef came out and met us during our visit and was so friendly. Drinks- Martinis are to die for! Lots of yummy and unique flavored.  Food- so so so good! We enjoyed the sizzling green beans, edamame, tofu lemongrass soup, pad thai and the others got tons of different things and everyone kept saying they loved it all.  Atmosphere- super chic and fun. We were a bit worried when we pulled up because it was in a strip mall type place but once you're inside you feel like you are in San Francisco.  We will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Thai restaurants and I go way back, if you are looking for Thai food...this isn't the spot for you. I give it two stars only because the pork pot stickers were decent, the servicers were attentive and it was a neat ambiance. Ordered spicy chicken basil, no bueno. All the food was very bland. My husband had the crispy noodles with beef, the meat was chewie/grisly. He asked for it spicy and they brought him a side of chili paste. Not sure why they couldn't make it spicy for him while preparing the food. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Food was excellent (and reasonably priced): Had the Beef Thai soup (amazing), spicy wings, sweet potato fries and spicy basil tofu dish. Service was excellent. Décor is decidedly chic and reminded me of the hipper places in NYC.  Went on a Sunday evening @ 5PM. By the time we left, nearly all tables were full. Very mixed crowd - young, old, straight, gay, families, etc.  But the food I would go back for in a hot second."}
{"text":"My wife and I showed up around 8pm last Sunday.  The band had finished for the night and there were plenty of open tables.  We had the worst service ever from a server named J$#@&*e.  She could not help us figure out what some of their  ingredients were on their dishes, the food took for ever to arrive and our drinks came after that.  She did not have a pen when it came time to validate our groupon and wanted to take my cell with her to the register, which I refused.  Our to go boxes were \"thrown\" on the table. We usually would give a place a 2nd chance but make sure we do not get the same server but after reading similar reviews, we will forever pass on this place.  There's better Thai places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I was a little nervous to try something new, but this place was recommended by a friend! Very nice service. Amazing food! So much flavor! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Service: Was good. Our server was nice and attentive  Atmosphere: Went here around 730 on Friday and it wasn't very busy so we were seated right away. They have a neat mural of Buddha on the wall and three large projector screens which was neat but they were playing Anime, which for me wasn't really entertaining. They have a nice bar area as well.  Food: We ordered the Lemongrass Tofu Pho which had a really great spicy broth. Really good broth actually. I wasn't into the large pieces of tofu though. Also got the Steak Pho which my bf liked but said the sauces weren't making the broth spicy enough. We also shared a plate of the Pineapple Fried Rice which was really tasty! Really loved the rice. I would go back again and try something else on their tasty menu."}
{"text":"Red Thai or Red Chili? The hottest Pad Thai ever tasted. Just red chili taste,no tamarind flavor. I ordered extra vegetable (paid $2) I did not see any extra vegi. carrot,bean sprouts,brown onion, tiny straw mushroom, I did not even see any green on the plate. I offered left over to unfortunate man in front of 99 cents store ( in the same mall ) even he did not want to eat it."}
{"text":"First my only complaint - there is no baby changing table in the women's restroom. So I had to change my baby's diaper on the floor of the bathroom which was really gross to me. But at least it looked clean. But this will likely result in us not coming back unfortunately.   This place is more fusion than traditional thai. The martinis were good. Very interesting and entertaining descriptions. The have awesome cucumber water instead of plain water. Had the spicy red curry and it had a good spice to it. My husband had the pad thai and enjoyed it.   My husband's complaint was that his beer (IPA) on Draft was warm. I tried it and agreed that it should have been colder.   Overall it's a cool space and you don't feel like you are in a strip mall when inside. The food was good. Just please get a baby changing station installed!"}
{"text":"Really awesome place, long open bar with huge projection screen playing random anime, love the concept and the bar. Staff is real friendly and there's great appetizers from 3-6pm. Lychee martini was good, strong, but good. For appetizers tried the ginger pork and the almond chicken, both were very flavorful and good amount of meat. Overcoming sickness so I was still a little stuffed up and I ordered the lemon grass soup. I must say it definitely swept me off my feet, perfect flavor and great amount of spice. It is a little on the spicy side, but I love love heat! I will most likely return with some friends. I can see this place getting real busy on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"I've been to Red Thai many time and have never had a bad meal. I have tried everything on the menu, minus seafood dished. The food is very well prepared and the flavors compliment everything in the dish. My favorites are the Black Dragon, and Red Thai Tofu, Sizzling Green Beans, House Dynamite, Pad Thai, and Bo Luc Lac salad. There is also a great happy hour with great martinis. The atmosphere with anime and music is a perfect blend. So happy to have this restaurant in our neighborhood and love this place!"}
{"text":"Food is adequate but don't call it \"Thai\"...it's infusion or whatever want to call it. It's like all of the owner's prior restaurants...a conglomeration of Asian food Americanized. There is alot of it so that is the main bonus in eating here.    But caveat emptor...both my dining companion and I were unhappy to discover when our checks came that we were charged more than 50% more than we expected to pay.  Lo and behold, the substantial upcharge for shrimp is buried in the fine print at THE VERY BOTTOM of the menu.    This seemed very much like false advertising and we were upset that it wasn't obviously printed in the menu where the price of each entree was listed.  When we brought it to our server's attention, her reply was essentially \"tough, it's printed at the bottom.\"  No oh, I'm sorry, let me see what I can do..  I vowed never to return b/c there are plenty of restaurants that clearly display the price of items that I order.  Is this business practice why the owner's restaurants open and close all over town regularly?  I don't know but I felt cheated."}
{"text":"Great space. Very dramatic. Food was really good. Potstickers were excellent with a crispy crust. Dynamite chicken was flavorful with the right combination of sweet and spicy.  Service was great. Worth trying. I'd go back"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had. I've searched for years to find a good Thai food restaurant in AZ and this is it! I definitely recommend the truffle edamame, shrimp spring rolls and the Spicy Basil dish. We will be back regularly. Excellent food!"}
{"text":"Very nice place to chill and have drinks. Prices are good. The only problem is the food is not that great. I expected better. If u love Thai food. Go to a Thai Resturant. I still think it's a fun place to have drinks."}
{"text":"Delicious Asian flavors and decent craft cocktails. Service was great, but we were one of the two parties in the place. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Decided to have Thai last night at Red Thai very cool place with two restaurants inside definitely can host a birthday party or very cool and hip trendy coil anime movie  On above the bar"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last week and I loved it.  To start, the interior is nice and big: like a long hallway with high ceilings. Raised booths in the center are flanked by tables and a huge bar that runs the length of the interior.  The atmosphere hovers between casual and semi-casual: As the sun went down the lights dimmed while anime continued to play on the walls (silently). It's a nice inviting space that would work in a variety of dinner scenarios.  Beer selection was good, with a few local specialties and the usual asian imports: Kirin, Sapporo, etc. I can't speak to the cocktails but the bar seemed to have an extensive collection.  Onto the meal. The food was good. My group ordered a variety of appetizers and entrees which we split. The focus is on Thai, but there are a few Vietnamese items on the menu. Overall it was great. Things were toned down a bit (less fish sauce/chilies) but the tastes were fantastic. The stand-outs for me were the sugar-cane pork appetizer: minced pork formed around a piece of sugar cane, fried and served with a sweet, tangy sauce; and the green papaya salad: fresh, crisp and deliciously spicy with some added sambal sauce.  I had a great time here and I'd definitely go back in the future. Especially to check out their happy hour. Good prices on appetizers and drinks, though you are restricted to sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Best hidden gem. Will be back again. Top shelf liquors. Live DJ and more. They served pho which was delish and hit the spot. Perfect spot to chill with the bestie."}
{"text":"When Sochu closed, I was so disappointed. Then I found Red Thai. I'm so glad I did. It's Sochu -reincarnated. Same delicious food that makes me want more. Everything is delicious. The atmosphere is cool & funky with a large bar & amine playing on the bar wall. Friendly attentive service, delicious food & plenty of free parking. Triple threat... Go ~ NOW!"}
{"text":"So we tried this place on a whim bc I didnt feel like cooking dinner after swim class.  Awesome drinks, but the food was over priced, half of a Cornish hen for $14! Come on... the ambience is really cool."}
{"text":"Good chicken lollipops, value for money kinda place, nice ambience with three gigantic screens"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband on a Groupon the food was delicious we had pho soup the pad Thai and dessert. We were STUFFED the pho tai was huge and came with a lot of meat super filling! my husband really loved the pad thi it had a nice spice to it! I definitely recommend this place to anyone that loves Thai food"}
{"text":"Food quality very poor too bad because very nice bar inside to hang at Happy hour good prices, however not worth it because 3 apps ordered none were acceptable."}
{"text":"My family and i are so disappointed with this restaurant and we didn't even get to try the food,  We were so excited for a new restaurant located near us that offer gluten free options. Our son has celiac and is 3 years old. Redthai advertises gluten free options and the phoenix new times has written great reviews in regards to the owner of this restaurant. We went to eat here tonight. Again, our son is only 3 so he isn't going to eat spicy chicken pad Thai and or curry chicken etc. we were told by two servers that the chef would not deviate from the menu. We asked if the chef Would make him grilled chicken and rice or grilled chicken and rice noodles. The servers still said that they would not Make it for our son. Are You kidding me? What chef would not be accomodating to a child with allergies. i guess we thought wrong about this new establishment. What a bad impression. My family and I are natives to central phoenix and we have been to many restaurants in the valley that are much more accommodating to our son and his needs and we have no reason to go back here. Obviously  We got up and left this restaurant knowing that  we would never return."}
{"text":"This is a great spot! So happy it's just a mile down the street from my casa. Cool vibe, not too crowded, cute little patio area.  Food:  The chili chicken wings are to die for! I am already craving them again...the sauce is on point.  I had the Thai Pho. SO GOOD! The spicy lemongrass broth is so delicous and the perfect amount of heat. The beef was sliced thin and tasted delicious, just wish there was a little more of it.  My BF had the Kobe pho and he seemed to really like that as well.   The price is right and the service is pretty good. We will certainly be back to try more of the menu"}
{"text":"First time here and I don't think I will be Ever be back. Everything was soooooooo salty. Food was mediocre but salty.   The one thing that disappointed me the most was their lack of knowledge on specific food that weren't Thai. I ordered \"bo Luc lac\", a Vietnamese dish. This is normally beef cut into cubes, marinated, cooked and stirred with sweet white onions, and topped over lettuce. This was nothing like that at all. The beef were in super thin slices, marinated with some salty sauce and left all dry looking in a bowl next to a plate of lettuce, carrots, sesame seeds and sauce? Tasted nothing like the Bo Luc lac I've ever eaten at restaurant or home made by my mother. I don't think they should have named this \"bo Luc lac\" because it's going to customers who aren't familiar with this great dish a false impression of what it really is.  Second order was clams in basil sauce and third was their chicken lollipop. Both were so salty I couldn't even finished. I normally like salty things but this was more than I can handle.  Needless to say, hubby and I didn't finish any of the dish ordered. Not authentic what so ever.  I love supporting small local businesses but I won't be back. Sorry Red Thai."}
{"text":"No clue what I ate, as my boyfriend ordered it all. But I loved it. The anime at the bar makes me smile and the drinks are delicious. We are always happy to eat here. Service of course, was also great."}
{"text":"Awesome place! I had no idea it was here. Amazing ambience and music. Great atmosphere and huge screens playing anime, totally awesome.  Food was great too! :-) The almond chicken was so crunchy and juicy."}
{"text":"Three of us came in during happy hour for an early dinner on 11-19-2014.  We sat in a booth and inquired about the wine.  We were told that we could not get happy hour prices while seated in our booth.  Happy hour is only available at the bar.  Our waiter told us we could move over and order at the bar and bring our drinks back to the booth but he could not serve us drinks at the booth.  I found this to be a ridiculous policy.  We came in to relax and enjoy one another's company, not spend our time moving over to the bar so we could get a glass of wine and then move back again to drink it with our meal.  We drank water and did not pay for alcohol for this reason only.  When we ordered one person in our group requested a separate bill.  She was told that each separate check is $2.00.  Seriously?  I eat out a lot and I have never heard of such a thing.  Whoever is making the rules in this restaurant apparently doesn't care that they are offensive to customers.   I worked in a restaurant for many years and we always went above and beyond to make our customers feel welcomed and valued...and respected.  Red Thai operates on a different level, apparently.  Too bad.  The food is good but the quirky rules make it a turn off."}
{"text":"Ecstatic that restauranteur Johnny Chu and his wife have opened a restaurant in this North Central Phoenix plaza - EDGY, HOT, BIG CITY (like SF or NYC) VIBE with YUMMY FRESH FOOD. The cool factor is almost underground and it was a Monday night in June!  Pad Thai was the perfect amount of heat, fresh and healthy portion.  Fried rice was delicious and the veggies with tofu (Dragon something) was also delicious. The bar top is a plenty and ready to accommodate and satisfy at least 15 lucky patrons with the fun or classic libations available.  I look forward to supporting and taking advantage of this hidden gem ... you should too before it explodes in popularity!  Area for improvement continues to be speed of service ...although its tempo vibes with the casual cool environment."}
{"text":"I adore Red Thai. They offer their own spin on Southeast Asian cuisine which makes it stand out from other joints. I've tried the spicy lemongrass soup with tofu, crispy noodle island with tofu, yellow curry with tofu, and sizzling green beans as an appetizer. My favorite thing here is the yellow curry with tofu- it's so creamy and flavorful. The ambiance of Red Thai is another thing that makes it stand out from the rest. On the outside it looks basic as it sits in a strip mall next to a hardware store but inside it's pretty hip. Large screens playing Anime surrounding the bar while rotating local hangs on the opposite end. Occasionally there's a DJ too. The staff is super friendly and attentive. Great date spot. Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Food and service were just ok. We left our camera on the table after the meal. One waitress told us she saw it and kept it inside, then the ones inside denied and took it. Have left stuff at many places before, hard to find such dishonesty in North America."}
{"text":"Fun time. Great food and drinks. Had the pot stickers and Almond Chicken. Yum!  Bartenders were friendly. Every fourth Friday a show!  Great job Afeelya!"}
{"text":"been here a couple of times now.. groovy place.. service is excellent.  I had the shrimp spring rolls and pho thai soup.  now this isn't your everyday chicken eyebrow, pig snout and beef elbow pho.. but I gotta say.. this pho gives a nod to tradition, but keeps it's own identity. I really really like this place. I'd love to venture out, but the pho is so pho-king good that I cant help but order it. gve her a go, you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"I have been to Red Thai a few times and every time the experience has been quite nice. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the food is pretty darn good too. I was there last night and my companion and I had two nice dishes and a wonderful relaxing conversation. I noticed that there were two morons here tonight who just each placed one star reviews because they thought their food was too spicy, even though they liked everything else about the restaurant. That is absolutely ridiculous. For one, I've never had anything here that was too spicy, and secondly if it was too spicy, in this restaurant the staff has always been extremely courteous in exchanging the dish. The two idiots who placed one star reviews from tonight must've had some other agenda. This is a wonderful place to take a date or meet up with friends, and for a Thursday night we were surprised that there must've been 60 to 80 people in there when we arrived at dinner time. The acoustics are such that even with this many people it's easy to carry on a conversation with the members of your table. I would highly recommend you coming to this restaurant and having an enjoyable evening. Is this a perfect restaurant, no, but I really can't think of anything but nice things to say about it. Great atmosphere, a fun drink selection, and an interesting, eclectic, very tasty and fairly priced menu. I probably gave it an extra star just because I'm too angry with the two individuals who abused the Yelp system tonight with one star reviews for this very nice establishment. If your food is too spicy and you don't say anything then that's your problem, give the restaurant a chance to fix it and don't be a jerk here on Yelp."}
{"text":"Not terribly flavorful, and some of the chicken in my curry was only half cooked -- something I discovered only after it was already in my mouth."}
{"text":"The atmosphere, the staff and most importantly the food were all amazing. This is really 2 places in one. The Red Thai normal dining side and the shabu side which is similar to fondue cooking. We had the red Thai food. The Island Noodles had the most amazing broth with multiple levels of flavor. The yellow curry was definitely one of the best I've ever had. Service was impeccable. You know your at some place that cares when the owner/chef comes out to see how all the tables are doing."}
{"text":"Some good, some meh. Came here on a whim while in the shopping mall.  Awesome coconut shrimp, red tofu pho, chicken pho. Fresh condiments! Beef pho not so great. Hot tea service, poor. Service, 3 forks. Nickel & Dime sides.   Buy a bib at dollar store if having pho."}
{"text":"A couple of great things here. The owner is definitely known in Az. He is very innoventive and always brings a cultural aspect to a nieghborhood. \"Jhonny\"has done it again!\" The restaurant has two sides a great Thai infusion plus fondue side to it. The bar tenders are are great. (Jeremy is great plus the girls); i love the uniqueneass to each element to include the bartenders, the live djs, food, art, the URBAN AND UP N COMING VIBE of th e communitis) with amazingness and to include the extra detail of the projector screen of \"culture and fun\" that is thrown in there. We had great food, chats with people and a great scenery of north mountain preserve.  Cheers & salud to everyone!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place was worth the 30 minute drive! Absolutely amazing taste and quality of food! Used a groupon at LUNCH. While the other reviewer is correct in saying you can't use it for their lunch specials (smaller portion, cheaper price) you can still eat there at lunch time you just have to buy the dinner portion size (11.98).   Very pleased with the quickness of service and the food. Sesame ginger chicken was very tasty and my 4 year old enjoyed it. Thai noodle soup, wow, so good! Thin sliced beef, yummy noodles, spicy lemongrass broth to die for. Red curry chicken, lots of sauce (how I like my curries) and very clean tasting.   Definitely going to be coming back! Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Amazing neighborhood place. It's worth the wait. The food is amazing and inexpensive. If you are a Dan of anime it's playing all along the wall behind the full bar. If you aren't, it's not intrusive at all. The DJ on Saturday night is a nice touch"}
{"text":"Never going back! Service sucks and owner needs to get over himself and learn how to treat customers. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I did not like this place. First, the food was not good. The waiter warned me that it was not going to be traditional, so I wasn't expecting that. But I just did not like the overly fishy taste. But what I enjoyed even less was the bizarre choice of music. It made me feel like I was in a really dark, violent horror movie. Might have been kind of cool if it were a Friday or Saturday night and I was there to kick off a wild evening, but this was lunch time during the middle of the week. The music started off depressing, and then got uber-creepy. That, coupled with the bad food and lack of lighting (not mood lighting -- just no lighting) made me not ever want to go there again."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to visit this place for some time and finally made it last week.  We got a wide array of food between the three of us and It was all pretty good.  We got pot suckers, fried tofu and the shrimp for appetizers.  I enjoyed the shrimp the most - a lot of flavor!  We all shared the green papaya salad and it was very refreshing.  For the main entrees we ordered the ginger fish, noodle salad and yellow curry.  I would only order the yellow curry if I went back (maybe the red) as the other entrees were fairly bland.  The atmosphere in the place was pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Good service, good happy hour prices, cool vibe and atmosphere, I ordered the yellow curry, it had the right amount of spice but was lacking flavor. I would recommend other Thai restaurants I you are looking for authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and had a exquisite time with Kyle! This bartender is THE bartender. He was so cool and recommended and made the best drinks for us. The food was really good too- spicy pad Thai and steamed dumplings mmmmmmmmm!  Thanks Kyle! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is mega cool! I have never been to a fusion restraunt like this. It has very nice seating areas, a huge bar, a small but great menu, great staff, and a laid back sufisticated atmosphere. I would come here to wine and dine a business client, take my wife out to dinner, or just come alone and enjoy the atmosphere. My waitress was Josie. She knew the menu well and was very personable. She was the icing on the cake and truly added to the experience."}
{"text":"A little hipster-y but good food.  We've gone a couple times for happy hour and had appetizers for supper. Good food. Decent service. Have always sat at the bar. The view out the front is pretty past the parking lot. It's a weird shopping center area,  but we like the restaurant"}
{"text":"Went here Thurs. night on a groupon, never could get the phone answered, or my e-mail, about whether I could use the groupon for lunch.  Food was great, had the spicy basil wok-fry and am eating the take out hot and sour soup I brought home.  This is excellent too, cannot figure out what the sliced white ingredient is, looks like a hard-boiled egg, but not sure.  I looked on the menu and still don't have a clue.  Would love to know.  I don't like anime, could care less about that, but we had an attentive waitress, wish I knew her name, and I plan to go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic find in the neighborhood.  Check this place out for super tasty pho fusion.  Ordered the Pho Tai, which was beefy, oniony tasty goodness.   So good, I'll be back for that as takeout. The Thai Noodle Soup was spicy.  Normally, I'd add all the jalapeños but that would have been overkill.  Potstickers were perfectly cooked and very satisfying for a little crunch."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out. It was my first time here and the service is decent. I ordered the Pad Thai w/ tofu & it was way too spicy to the point where I couldn't enjoy my food. I usually like spicy and I can handle, but this was just too much. It tasted really gingery as well. The portions are huge, so I think that's good for their pricing. But overall, the food was okay. The environment is very chill & open."}
{"text":"First and foremost Josie was AAAAAMAZING!!! Food was great too!! This is a fun atmosphere and a great dinner date place!! I highly recommend this place!! Great drinks, appetizers, and food!! Love all of it!!"}
{"text":"My colleague and I decided to have an early dinner here because we both love Thai food and wanted to try a place with an out-of-the-ordinary atmosphere. The staff was friendly and attentive and we were seated immediately; the place was spacious enough to be able to accommodate a significant dinner crowd. The lengthy layout and projected anime on the walls gave the place a modern informal vibe. Being able to arrive early enough to take advantage of happy hour prices was a plus for this visit. The food was flavorful, well-presented, and reasonably priced for the quality."}
{"text":"The red curry contained fresh snap peas, and crisp green peppers and carrots. SCORE on fresh veggies that aren't over cooked! The canned pineapple in the dish I could have done without.  There didn't seem to be enough rice for the bowl of curry but I ate it like soup. I can't stress enough how superb the red curry is.  They've got the spice mix down. The service was too slow as I waiting to get back to work and the bar tender kept forgetting about me. I had to ask for a box and then the check and then the check again until finally she apologized.  I hope the service will be better next time and can't wait to try more menu items.  The happy hour at the bar only rule is bullshit.  The inside is nice especially in contrast to the run down strip mall.   Sadly, the booths are not cozy. Why have hard booths!? Makes no sense.  Nice view of the mountain out the window."}
{"text":"The place was trendy with live music which was a little loud. The took a 30 minute break..ordered their coconut shrimp. They were good sized but I did not like the dipping sauce. .ordered the pad thai it was soupy. Not what I was used to . Also had the red curry however it was served with coconut milk. The chicken was tender.i did try their pho which was Decent .the broth was a little spicy.service was good"}
{"text":"This place has the best owner and the best food I have ever had. It is even better than in Thailand! The SUGAR CANE PORK is the best thing I have ever had in my life, wow!!! Everything was amazing!!!! I came here with a group. We had the crispy garlic shrimp, the pot stickers...OMG, A MUST GO PLACE. Seriously, everything we had was beyond good. I would highly recommend this place. You will go back time and time again.    Moving on to the entree we ordered the Sweet Ginger Fish.  The Thai ginger sauce was definitely sweet and it was glazed over chunks of breaded fish, the Chicken and Shrimp Pata was unbelievable..wow! JUST GO! You will love the atmosphere too, complete with buddhas, large screens and amazing servers/owner. Love, love the OWNER...GREAT GUY!!! Wish he would open a restaurant where I live and I told him this!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance! Not too noisy that you can't hear across the table but good mix of  music with DJ. Food is incredible!  Chicken Pad Thai was delicious, the Spicy Basil with beef was amazing (sweet basil flavor and just the right amount of spice) and the Pineapple Fried Rice with shrimp was so good and had a subtle taste of curry. Now for fried wonton dessert!  Food was served quickly and the service was great! It's not a huge restaurant but has a lively vibe and long bar with lots of seating."}
{"text":"Okay, this is an interesting place.  For me, location is great, and parking is also great (to me the less parking hassles the better as I hate a big to-do to get the night rolling).  This place works great for that.  The amazing large screen cinema and the ingenuity on that are worth a trip here if nothing more than to see something unique and interesting.   Creativity and boldness score high marks for me, as that is what I try to do in my legal practice.    The general ambience, cinema and the music create a nice experience.  The miso soup was really good, but unfortunately I cannot give my highest recommendation on the other dishes (as usuall with a new restaurants we sample several things our first time around).  The chicken and meat plates (I forget exactly what they were called) were not the best for me, and the wings were a little \"gamey\" (I actually wasn't even sure they were chicken).  At any rate, nothing ventured nothing gained.  To cut it short, I would go back, sit at the bar with my friends or clients and mark this as a great place to go catch up with old friends while enjoying the movie at the bar and music overlay.  The bar is suuuuuper looong in lenght and supper cool.    Again, my kudos goes out to the owner (who stopped by the table to say hi), and for turning a dead retail space into something amazing.  For me, it is a meet your friends/clients at the bar kinda place to get the night started or deal done.  For that reason alone, I am a fan.  They also have outside seating which scores points.  Keep up the good work.  I driove by tonight and saw a really packed crowd, so perhaps taste buds differ, and that is cool too.  A good crowd makes for a great time.  Have fun, and find your sizzle!

{"text":"What to have for Christmas Dinner, when everyone has come in gone for the holiday brunch?  Since the day's norm is Asian, I drove past a few establishments to see what was open.  Nothing was, so I made my way to Fresh & Easy to grab something for the hubby and I.  Then i saw the Red Thai sign.  We've seen it before, but hadn't yet given it a try.  The establishment itself is 5 stars in my book.  Modern, clean lines, OMG streaming Anime via NetFlix x3 on the walls behind the longest bar I've ever seen!  So cool.  First time and take-out so we ordered a couple of items to share + save.  Chicken Pho (VERY flavorful), Chicken Pad Thai (medium spice and delish but way stingy on the chicken) and RedThai Chicken & Rice (very bland/basic chicken that my 6 yr old loved, good rice but I won't order again).  Good service (for what it was...) and we will certainly be back for a proper experience.  Definitely one of the better Thai offerings around town!"}
{"text":"Yellow curry was lacking flavor and the chicken was chewy. Delivery was easy but not where I'd order from again if there are options."}
{"text":"Met some girlfriends for happy hour. Great place! Forward design, delicious food. We had spring rolls, papaya salad, tofu, edamame. And a great beer selection."}
{"text":"1st time here. Happy hour specials and anime will make this my go to spot at least once a month.  The yellow curry with chicken is excellent and the pad thai is a winner in my book.  Next time, I'm bringing friends!"}
{"text":"Came in tonight to grab some soup for a sick family at home. Got home to find out the order was pretty far from what I had asked for. Called Kyle, obviously frustrated by the situation. He quickly apologized and had a new order ready for me to pick up by the time I showed up. He went above and beyond even my scope of rectifying the situation. Exemplary customer service and fantastic food. Well worth the extra trip I had to make."}
{"text":"First of all, it smells like bleach when you enter the restaurant.  Makes you wonder what they're covering up. Then went to restroom,  which wasn't attended to, so hmmm...Then,  service was really bad! Waitress screwed up drink order,  brought 2 items at a time while we waited for the other 2; one in our party waited at least 5 min for her food/ entree after everyone else had their food. Then she blamed the kitchen instead of apologizing. There's more,  but suffice it to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"Best curry ever! Even better than Indian curry! Amazing pot stickers! (Like seriously amazing). Kyle is the light of my life. Such an amazing host!"}
{"text":"Touchstones. In my adopted city of Phoenix (don't tell the Princess, I tell her I'm a native), I have a handful of areas that stick out to me for know and unknown reasons.  12th Street and Northern is one of those areas.  Carlos O'Brien's with their turquoise dome anchoring the north end of the lot, across the way, the fluorescent green of Fresh & Easy has replaced the orange neon of the now extinct Osco Drug.  Ace Hardware with it's trademarked red beacon beckoning DIY'er has attracted another red renter of Phoenix strip mall space: Red Thai.  A belated birthday meal at the P's insistence caused me to open Yelp and check my hundreds of bookmarked \"need to checkout\"-yes, I don't just \"like\" your check-ins, I lust after your culinary exploitations :).  So thank you for recommending Red Thai, I can now too.  Very cool vibe and terrific Thai food.  I kicked off our celebration of my 52nd year with a cucumber Pearl Martini which was awesome and believe me, only one is needed.  The P loves coconut shrimp so we started with those and they didn't disappoint.  Light coconut flavored panko coating with a tasty array of dipping sauces-we knew we were in for a great evening. We progressed to the hot and sour soup which was a delight.  Wasn't a typical hot and sour but delicious nonetheless-give it a try.  My entrée was the dynamite XXX with chicken and the P stayed on the safe side with yellow curry with chicken.  I typically like to have the chef kick the heat up a couple of notches to blow my head off but the waiter instead offered to bring addition chili paste or Siracha and I'm glad he did, the dish was perfectly balanced with taste and heat.  The P's yellow curry needed a little salt but she was perfectly happy with it after a couple of shakes.  The portions were very generous and we ended up with enough to take some home.   The 70 foot bar with anime showing behind it was full of lively conversations and content patrons enjoying the satisfying servings of Red Thai on a beautiful Phoenix evening.    We're looking forward to going back and building a relationship with the newest inhabitant of my Phoenix touchstone, 12th Street and Northern."}
{"text":"Eve of Thanksgiving. We lucked out just finding availability at any eatery and we wanted Thai.  So sorry Red Thai but the service pulled you down. Our server was a delightful person but so overwhelmed and the place was not that busy. Felt bad for her but the management needs to look closely at training.  Decor is amazing however. One full wall of anime cartoons floor to ceiling, cool graphics, spacious. Very hip. Good choice of background music, seating comfortable. Bar huge!  Food did arrive after our drinks and was good. We all had  excellent martinis, perfectly mixed. I had coconut shrimp and shrimp spring rolls. Sister had noodles with brown sauce, good. Right brain had Red Thai deep fried Cornish hen, was dry but flavorful.   All in all I feel some work needed on front of house. Due to the holiday I figured things would probably be not normal. Next time hoping all the issues are worked out because it really is a cool place. Happy Holidays all!"}
{"text":"I'd heard that Johnny Chu had opened yet another restaurant, this time near 12th St. and Northern.  I was in the area and decided to stop by.  Very nice interior considering they're in a strip mall next to a 99 cent store and a now closed Fresh and Easy.  I'm hesitant to support chef/owners who open and close restaurants over and over again. I'll give this one another 6 months or so.  I ordered the Red Curry, as the \"to go\" menu is much more limited than the regular menu and figured I couldn't go wrong.  Wrong choice!  Not the same ingredients as described on the menu, and not nearly as spicy as I was promised.   To give them credit, they do seem to have a good happy hour menu/drink specials.  However, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Meal: Yellow curry with chicken and rice. I ordered the curry without carrots but it came with one and I was not going to send it back. Any how it turns out tasting pretty good. The yellow curry was in a large bowl but the rice was kinda small portion. Most of their menu items had carrots in it. Real Thai Dishes don't use carrots! Place: This place locate in a strip mall in the same area as Carlos O'brien Mexican Rest. right next to the 99 cents Store. Inside this place are well decorated with futuristic flare. They have projections on wall showing some sort animated japanese cartoons, quite interesting concept for a Thai food place. Wait staff: Very good, water refills frequently, only bad thing was that there were carrots in my curry! Carrot messes up everything. The prices: Median range about 10 dollars and up, if you want shrimps instead of checken or beef will be extra, I beleived it was 4 dollars extra."}
{"text":"Simply put this place is amazing and worth the drive and wait. The pineapple fried rice was amazing and the decor was so very chic"}
{"text":"First off,  I hate giving this place 3 stars as I absolutely loved the decor, art and overall atmosphere...and the cocktails were killer too (definitely try the Red Kissed)!  However, I was served a dish that was inedible and they did nothing about it.  I told the server it was so spicy that it was inedible and then he proceeded to ask me if I wanted to take it home with me...uh, no - I actually don't want to even look at it again as it burnt my taste buds.  I love Thai food and I love a little spice too...this dish was not clear that it would be THIS spicy.  My husband had the pineapple fried rice with chicken and shrimp and we both enjoyed the pork potstickers, so not a total loss.  I would definitely give this place a try again for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Good food and fun atmosphere! The service is okay, my servers never came by much in the three times I've been there. But everything else was great. Good prices"}
{"text":"Chef Johnny Chu is back at it again! I love this place! It's not your typical Thai restaurant - if you're looking for that I'm sure you can find one around. This place however is unique, delicious, serves excellent drinks and wonderful music.   Try their Lemongrass soup, it's a personal favorite.  It's rich in flavor and large enough to split or take leftovers for about $7! The Pad Thai is also great and honestly, I haven't had anything I didn't like at Red Thai. They offer a wide variety of martinis and cocktails which pair well with their in-house DJ on weekends.   If you're looking for flavorful food and an upbeat atmosphere for a date night or friend outing then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious. ...appetizers were fabulous. ..and the Green Buddha martini was my absolute favorite!! This place is going to be a new hangout for us!!"}
{"text":"The Kobe Pho was delicious. The broth was amazing and came with all the right fixings. Service was quick and great. Perfect cool, go-to lunch spot. Awesome deco too! Can't wait to try the other items on the menu"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant with split personality. On one side you can watch a Pokemon movie, and on the next you just keep busy dipping. I love the ambiance. Who would have thought to find such an interesting place next to a 99 cents store, but that's Central for you. One star off because I wasted a trip on Monday. I was in the mood for Red Thai, but no can do. The one restaurant with 2 dining rooms... but one big closed door!"}
{"text":"If you want good Thai food... GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!! Ordered 4 different items and everything was mediocre. The worst dish we had was the pad thai. The noodles were basically sitting in watered down soup. The best dish we had was the chicken lollipops. Even the thai tea was gross. How can you ruin a thai tea???  Yeah, they play anime movies in the background, big deal. It's in a basic shopping center next to a 99 cents store.  Not impressed. Will not be back...."}
{"text":"Went to dinner there last week with my girlfriend. Service was absolutely on point. Their specialty martinis are 100% unique & the portions were so large we both had leftovers for another day. It is about a 10 mile drive for us and absolutely worth it. Putting it on our favorite places to frequent for sure.  I think the retro music/ambiance with the anime videos on the walls, put them over the top. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place numerous times and am remiss in not reviewing it sooner. It does not look like much from the outside, but it is a hip, stylish restaurant with a great bar and cool décor. Sometimes a DJ provides background music. I have loved all of Johnny Chu's restaurants and this is no exception. It's a great mix of small plates to share and larger entrées, with a great cocktail menu. Red Thai has an interesting Asian fusion menu, with great spring rolls, noodle dishes, a few curries, and soups and salads. Great food, very reasonable, I have never been disappointed. It is one of my staples."}
{"text":"An attempt at a pleasant Happy Hour was ruined by a barman who couldn't have had a worse attitude if he tried (maybe he was trying). We would like to love this place, it's new to the neighborhood. This will be our last visit, there are places in Phoenix that actually employ staff that are committed to facilitating a nice dining experience. Not Red Thai."}
{"text":"Fantastic ambiance and food, I'm excited to have this place in my neighborhood....it feels like you live in a real city"}
{"text":"As a serious critique of asian/Thai food I was interested in how I would feel about this place.  Verdict: I am very impressed, I think it is a great blend of modern/early/hip atmosphere. Although not completely authentic, it is a great blend. I would definitely refer this establishment to anyone."}
{"text":"Went for dinner Monday night and had a blast. The food was exceptional and the ambiance was quite nice. Had to look around a few times to get a refill as the staff was congregating talking to each other instead of checking on the tables. Only about 12 covers when we were there and looked like 3 or 4 wait staff.  Ordered the sizzling shrimp, lemograss pho and pot stickers. It was damn good and I will return.."}
{"text":"WOW!!!  Another gem in our backyard.  We stopped in while on a bike ride yesterday and parked our bikes next to the patio.  The waiter immediately came out and kept us hydrated while we enjoyed the Yellow Curry, Almond Chicken, Crispy White Fish and Pad Thai.  The prices made feeding our family affordable and I can't wait to try more options on the menu as everything we had was amazing."}
{"text":"Very bad first impression, standing at the \"wait to be seated\" sign for 15 mins, and there was absolutely no one come out to greet us although there were plenty of empty tables. We were very excited to find out a new Thai restaurant in town but unfortunately didnt even have a chance to try out the food :("}
{"text":"This review is an update on the food and experience. The restaurant is tasteful with upscale décor and art. Very clean inside and out. My first dining experience was \"OK.\" This is a restaurant I would suggest not to go to for lunch time if your in a hurry. I arrived at the restaurant at 11:05 on the dot. I was greeted right away. My two friends and I sat in a booth in the middle of the restaurant. The cozy seating and place settings were another added charm to the nicely decorated restaurant. Intrigued by the lunch special my friends and I ordered the following. Chicken Pho for me, another friend ordered the Green Papaya Salad and the other friend ordered the Yellow Curry. No appetizers for any of us this time. My food did not arrive until 11:40. We were the second customers in the restaurant. I feel that our food was very simple it should not have taken this long. I will also mention the friend who ordered the Yellow Curry did not come until 10mins after we got our food. I did see two people come in for a carry out order along with a man place an order to go during this time. I think it is a timing issue. The restaurant being new I think they will get better on timing when they get use to the flow. The service was good and the waiter was tentative. My friends and I thought the food was pretty good. I am going to try them again to give them the benefit of the doubt. I am happy to see a nice classy thai place move in the area. This area needed it. I'm looking forward to a better experience next time around."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, there was a gal that seemed as if she hated her job. She yelled at my husband for trying to sign in. She assumed we were another group until the sat down. Paid for my food which was delicious. As I'm putting my food away I realize there is a visitor in my food. I went to tell the young lady before throwing up my entire meal and she says oh no. They way she said it made it seem as this is a normal thing here. I have been up all not sick as a dog. I wake up out of my sleep vomiting. 5:23 AM still sick. Eat at your own risk. For 91.00 you can get an insect in your dish."}
{"text":"Awesome dumplings! Great service! And a mean martini...a fun place for happy hour and dinner. Looking forward to coming back for shabu!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and two thumbs up every time ! Staff is really friendly as well and HH and Lunch specials are awesome! Kid friendly too :)"}
{"text":"The food here is exceptional. Thank you yelp for helping me find this hidden gem. The drag show last night was fun!"}
{"text":"Ok it's about time I update this review. Simply put I love this place!!! The food is so incredibly good! Love Kyle - he's so funny and a terrific bartender. I've been so many times now for lunch and dinner that I know this newer staff and they're great.  Be sure to try the pineapple fried rice with chicken and the udon noodles with beef - you'll thank me!"}
{"text":"Fabulous!!!! Fantastic!!!! Linda and Johnny Chu are excellent hosts... We have been following this dynamic duo for decades. No matter what concept and what neighborhood they are in we follow them... Johnny puts so much love into everything he creates.... His masterful knowledge of infusing and respecting each ingredient he uses is incredible... The balance of flavors with every bite creates for your palate to say woooo hoooo what a ride...."}
{"text":"Having a really great lunch here, ordered spicy beef Thai noodle soup- was not disappointed"}
{"text":"First, this is NOT a thai restaurant.  It is a club-like bar that plays boom-boom house music, where men in suits meet to discuss business and drink cocktails. All it's missing is a dance floor. They also happen to have a bunch of seats and serve food. I can't fault them too much for that, I just wish I would have read that before going in, as it was not at all what I expected to experience when I see the words \"thai restaurant\".  Second, the food. I ordered the red curry. Although it was labeled as \"spicy\", it left a lot to be desired. This is the southwest, where is the heat?? That's just a personal preference, but other people who want hot thai food may want to ask for it to be cranked up a bit. However there is a bigger problem. I'm pretty sure my curry was \"assembled\" rather than \"cooked\". There is no way this was made from scratch. Things that might not have come from a can or bag or tray in my curry: bell peppers, sweet potatoes, and maybe the rice. Prepackaged tofu; preprocessed carrots, onions and snow peas; baby corn; canned pineapple. It just all tasted a bit fake, like the cook had just given up. For an $11 curry (and $2 for extra rice?! It's RICE. That's like, the cheapest food item on the planet) and with all the positive reviews I expected much, much more.  I keep seeing how inflexible the staff is to alter/ make accomodations and I can't help shake the feeling that maybe it's because everything is already made, just waiting to be heated up and sent out the door.   This is my very first yelp review. Based on the over 100 people who seem to inexplicably love this place, I felt it an obligation to forewarn other people. Overall it wasn't terrible. The food is decent, but it by no means deserves 5 stars. It's just that not one single aspect of this lunch was even \"better than average\". Heck, I might still order something else to be picked up and see if any of the other dishes are better, but I absolutely will not be returning for a dine-in experience.  Basically, I suggest reading Scott C.'s 4-start review below. Everyone has personal preferences, and all of the \"good\" things he lists are the exact things I dislike. I wish I would have read that before going. So, pick your poison I guess."}
{"text":"Cannot wait to come back!!!!  Excellent service, DJ, food Anime...!  The whole package!!!"}
{"text":"We have come here several times and we Never leave disappointed! The vibe is elegant yet casually zen with a fun factor with animation playing as a backdrop to the expansive bar! Some nights there is live music which is always enjoyable. The food is the Show Stopper with a fun flare mixing sweet with hot, tangy with zesty and a playful spin on the usually same old same old thai places!! The service is always quick and pleasant with suggestions off the menu! I'm always happy to have leftovers the next day!!  Thanks for the good times and we will see you soon!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy this place, service hasn't always been \"spot on\" but the food is always stellar and it won't cost you a fortune, don't miss out on a good time here!"}
{"text":"The worst padthai  ever, but this is a really nice place with three big screens on and a fun DJ on Friday night,"}
{"text":"We had a great meal here tonight with a big group.  We found the curry much better than the run of the mill curry.  The truffle edamame were also tasty.  We had a variety of mains and all were very tasty.  Looking forward to being back!"}
{"text":"Hot and sour soup was amazing. Loved the atmosphere. I will definitely be back to work my way through the entire menu. Welcome to the neighborhood. A great addition."}
{"text":"Went there with some dear friends a few months ago when we found out Shabu Fondue is closed on Mondays.  Then returned with my husband a few weeks later.  Although I basically ate the same things on both trips, I guess I can say they are consistent.  My favorite dish was the hot and sour soup with shrimp.  I expected it to taste like the usual you find in every Chinese restaurant.  I was sorely mistaken.  Theirs is so much lighter, very spicy, but less on the sour.  I also tried the kobe pho which I did like, but it seemed boring compared to the hot & sour.  We also tried the pork gyoza and spring rolls, both very good.  My surprise of the night was the fried tofu my friend suckered us into ordering.  One, I hate tofu.  Two, see number one.  Well apparently, much as the State Fair has figured out, you fry anything and it becomes delicious, especially with the dipping sauces.  In fact, it kind of reminded me of paneer.   Unfortunately, what's also consistent is service.  Not terrible, but could be better.  My husband and I asked for small bowls since we were sharing the soups.  We had to ask twice.  I ordered a bottle of sparkling water and had to ask for a glass.  It was a one litre bottle.  Just little things that could be better, but overall, I really enjoyed both visits.  Oh, and they run anime movies on big screens behind the bar.  My husband loved that."}
{"text":"THE absolute best Thai food in town. They have amazing spring rolls. Can't wait to come back to town so I can have dinner here! For sure missed it!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were hungry for lunch after a workout and she recommended here. She said if I enjoyed Sochu House, then I would love it here because it was the same owner and chef.  We shared the... Saigon Egg Rolls - 8 crispy mini egg rolls with a spicy but sweet dipping sauce and a side of papaya salad. These are not your typical egg rolls. The outside was crispy like that on that dessert Baklava but warm and inviting in texture. It didn't have that overfried thick oiliness like most egg rolls do. Instead it was light and flavorful and perfect. The cool papaya salad balanced the lightly fried egg rolls.  Truffle Edamame - the Edamame was bathed, not sprinkled, with truffle butter oil. I'm used to most places just sprinkling a bit of truffle oil but here, because it was melted truffle butter, I was in love with this Edamame!!!  We both ordered the beef pho, Pho Tai. It was a hearty portion even at lunch. The broth was flavorful and enjoyable. I would order it again!  I guess at night, there are projections on the walls over the bar. Sometimes it's anime, sometimes it's art. I would like to see it at night while having dinner or grabbing a drink. There is definitely a chic warehouse vibe to the place. I like it! Definitely a hidden gem like other reviewers have mentioned!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Foods great, service is great, nice ambiance. Never had a bad experience. I would consider it more of a fusion type restaurant than authentic. I really wish they would add some of the vegetarian small plates that they offered at their other restaurant Sochu House (that closed down)."}
{"text":"I ordered three dishes because I was starving and wanted left overs. I don't remember as it's been a while but it was a hard noodle with beef and broccoli, and fresh rolls, and something else. It was all pretty gross. I had just arrived moving from seattle and I love thai food. Love the bar and the anime they play, but that food was not good at all. The spicy sauce with the rolls was strange. I'll drink there...prolly won't eat there again though."}
{"text":"Amazing little place you would never expect in a strip mall. I took my daughter with me for a quick bite and we had the incredible shrimp spring rolls and orange puffs (chicken). For my entree, I had the ginger mint duck salad. While it was pretty tasty, it was really lacking in duck and the pieces were small and mixed in.  Next time, I'll try something other than the duck salad, but overall great place and will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food. Loved the truffle Edemame. Just don't sit in a booth.  The backs move."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last night and almost went back tonight for takeout! The nondescript exterior betrays the interior design. When I looked through the floor-to-ceiling windows, I was almost disappointed I couldn't go inside, but the I remembered I had a new patio spot (walking distance, yay) for my favorite companion to join me. The servers were very sweet and brought me a bowl of water for my pup while my friend and I previewed the drink menu. I ordered a cucumber infused martini, but was actually carded, and because I haven't replaced my license since losing it at O'hare's TSA, I was denied that service. Hey, at least they're being up and up on that, and I'll definitely be back in the future, with proof of age on hand (my dinner partner had a lot of fun at my expense at \"getting carded\").   The black dragon with shrimp was fantastic! The baby book choy was so fantastic I could have had a plate full of just that, but then again, the black bean sauce, the shrimp... Well I ate everything on the plate like a proper glutton. I will definitely be back, sooner than later, and may possibly become hypnotized by the projected anime films and the tempting cocktails. And I plan to eat my way through the entire menu. I'm so happy Johnny's in action in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Notes: Anime; noisy; electronic music; dj  If you're GenX this just might be your place! Anime projected on the walls, electronic music from a DJ and noisy people at the bar. The food we ordered was very good. I had fillet mignon Pho and my wife had a shrimp rice dish and I would recommend both. The server was very attentive but not overly. The only reason I can't give Red Thai 4 stars is because of the noise."}
{"text":"Really wanted to order takeout,  as I've wanted to try this place since they opened...... But ended up ordering elsewhere as there is no readable menu posted.... Fail"}
{"text":"The food was HORRIBLE. The service was terrible. My waitress might have even been high. I asked her for soy sauce and sriracha... she said they may not have them. In a Asian restaurant... are you kidding? I will never go back."}
{"text":"This place is so cute. The food is great, very spicy which I love. The service was very quick and all the employees are very nice. The portions are huge ! I ate my pad Thai for 4 meals. You can definitely share the entrees there. I will be back ! (-:"}
{"text":"Have eaten in and ordered to-go, great service and food both times! The fried tofu and spring rolls are awesome. My favorite is the pineapple fried rice! Cool atmosphere, friendly staff!"}
{"text":"My favorite Chef for over 7 years.  You won't be disappointed with his food. Love this place and the atmosphere. Thomas did a great job serving us. Made my brother's birthday very special! Thanks Jonny!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE!! They made us sit at the bar to get happy hour. The bartender could care less we were sitting there. The guy next to us had been sitting there for 15 minutes and still had not even received a glass of water! The bartender and every other employee stood around talking laughing and at one point the bartender was on the phone. Never did get one bit of service in the 20 minutes we sat there. AWFUL! There were dirty dishes all over the bar. This place has gone downhill fast. Sad. I will never ever return. If I could give them zero stars I would! Possibly even minus 5!"}
{"text":"Great experience at this restaurant! We brought in my 18 month old daughter and weren't shown any of a the discouraging looks another reviewer experienced, but we did go in for dinner on a Monday and a little early (before the night crowd rush). The atmosphere was modern and chic without being pretentious.   The food was amazing and our waitress was beyond helpful!!!!  When ordering our entrees with tofu she automatically asked us if we were vegetarian or vegan. She was able to quickly outline all of the times that would be ok us (we're  vegan)  and also which ones could be modified to be. For vegans this is RARE and SO APPRECIATED!!! We definitely will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing after all of the great reviews. It's sister restaurant, Sochu House in Central Phoenix is much better. We had the Shrimp Spring Rolls, Pineapple Fried Rice and the Spicy Basil. The spring rolls were not bad if you used the sauce (which ended up being the best part of the meal). The pineapple fried rice was bland and yet burned my tongue with sodium. It was made with crushed pineapple instead of chunks which meant it had no pineapple flavor unless you ate one of the minuscule pieces by itself. The spicy basil was so salty that it was practically inedible. We also had thai tea which was nothing outstanding. Overall, I would say avoid this place unless you like bland, salty food."}
{"text":"Holy cow.  Got the Saigon egg rolls to start. First, it's hilarious that they said it was with a side of papaya salad. It's a garnish. The papaya taste was barely discernible and overall didn't have the lunch or tang of any papaya salad I've ever eaten. If anything, it was watery and if this is the same as the salad portion, I would stay away from it. The egg rolls are weird tasting with no flavor at all. This is atypical from regular egg rolls, I get it... But it just doesn't taste good.  Entrees were udon chicken special and bf got Sizzling Shrimp.   For both of us, we werent asked spice levels so we did not think of anything of it but holyyyyy molyyyy they were both SO spicy. I just ate what noodles I could abdllnd avoided the rest.  Yeah yeah I get it, it's Thai food and I think even the Sizzling Shrimp had spicy in description. But both bf and I are not strangers to spice...There's another Thai place we frequent. But we both could not finish our plates; there so much chili on my plate I had to scrape it aside. We're not those people that have their entrees redone though I'm sure they wouldn't mind doing it.  Please be forewarned!!  The rest of the menu seemed uninspiring and you can pretty much get every item on there elsewhere.  Lack of stars for disappointing appetizer, dismal menu, and high price for what you get. Seriously, you can get a lot of these items for a lot cheaper and it would be better tasting at  local Chinese and Vietnamese places. Also factored just a little bit is the crazy spice levels.... Just a little bit though, because we could have said something but they really should have been more clear on."}
{"text":"Yeah... I wasn't blown away by this restaurant. I went in there expecting very little. Ask and you shall receive. I wouldn't recommend you go there unless it's your best friend's birthday party and she's been giving you the guilt trip about going."}
{"text":"I have been in a number of times for the pho tai now. The last time I was in, it was simply the best I have ever had. Whatever tweaks they made to the dish has, based on my palette, perfected it! Can't wait for pho night next week!"}
{"text":"This place has great food. But when you walk in the first thing you notice are those disgusting ugly chairs on the patio also inside. Listen to me you want more business upgrade your patio and chairs inside. And do not forget. A better hostess not one with and ugly look of despair on her face. When someone gives a compliment smile your tip could be larger. Ps, the dam chairs i almost didn't come in!"}
{"text":"Surprising place and will go again. Loved the truffle edamame but not the hot and sour soup. Can't wait to explore the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I really liked it. They had some great beer on tap and get a bottle. However it was a little weird to see anime playing on the walls and while that may not be something I'm a custom too I still really liked it. I ended up getting the chicken pad Thai and while it was much spicier than I would've preferred it was still very good and I would definitely go back again and I'm definitely gonna recommended for people who want to have Thai food."}
{"text":"If you want authentic thai that will light your soul on fire with taste and authenticity of Thailand. Give  this place a chance the chef is legendary and you can tell the heart is in the food. Please enjoy!! But remember real thai has got heat people!!"}
{"text":"First time here! The bartenders service was GREAT! I didn't catch his name though. The ambiance was nice. We ordered pot stickers as an app, and the basil dinner entree and pho ga (which was pho with chicken). Food tasted pretty good. My only complaint is that the food took over 30 minutes to get to us (& they weren't busy). The decor was nice. The bar tender was knowledgeable. We'd definitely give this place another shot and recommend it if we have another pretty positive experience!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics The Rolling Stones - Paint It Black)  I see the Red Thai and I want to try it out So many options I want to eat them all I see Chef Chu walk by dressed in his kitchen clothes I have to try the shrimp and some more eggrolls   I see a line of peeps and they're here for Red Thai With mixed drinks and a beer, both always worth a come back I start to Bo Bite and quickly rate away Unlike a newbie Yelper I just Bo Bite everyday   Local celebrity Chef Johnny Chu's Red Thai is a new restaurant offering up Vietnamese and Thai fusion food.  As you walk towards the restaurant, you'll notice his signature night light theme; violet, bold red, and let's not forget statue of Buddha!  As I walked into the main room, first thing I notice was Anime movies playing across the walls behind the bar.  The wall is literally the screen projector.  Overall, the place gave off a nice vibe and energy!  I came here with a group and as we ordered our drinks and we couldn't wait to be seated to order some bites!  We started off with some appetizers; Spicy Mint Shrimp, Thai Fried Chicken, Saigon Egg Rolls.  All sounds pretty exotic and it was.  I have to proclaim this; I love the Spicy Mint Shrimp!  I could eat that sauce with rice any day and any time!  Spicy indeed, while the onions and mint gave it a pungent aroma along with some texture!  The Thai Fried Chicken was good and crispy and cooked to perfection; the way it should be! The Saigon Eggs Rolls was a nice compliment to finalize our appetizer round; nice and crunchy along with a refreshing papaya salad.    Moving on to the entree we ordered the Sweet Ginger Fish.  The Thai ginger sauce was definitely sweet and it was glazed over chunks of breaded fish.  Overall, I liked it, but not as much as my appetizers.  The sauce was okay, but I would have liked to see the entire fish fried and battered then glazed with the sauce.  I think I'm an old school Asian that can appreciate that sort of presentation. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed Red Thai very much! Tried it for the first time last night and left happy. Hip decor and mellow house music playing. Anime movies projected on the wall. Cool vibe. Steamed dumplings and truffle edamame to start. Both fantastic! A great Beef Pho and a Yellow Chicken Curry for entrees. Also excellent! Prices were affordable. The Pad Thai martini i ordered was a little unbalanced but everything else was on point. A new fav in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Truly a hidden gem! I was so surprised by both the interior of the restaurant and the quality of the food. From the outside, Red Thai looks drab and unassuming in a mediocre, run-down strip mall. Don't be afraid!! Once you enter the restaurant, it is like being in a completely different place! Interior design is light, airy and open. The dining room is much larger than I expected, with a long bar the length of the room. I really like the giant buddha on the back wall.  We ordered sweet and sour soup to start, which was spicy but very tasty! This is not your traditional soup - it has a really unique flavor, but definitely delicious! I had yellow curry with vegetables for lunch and my friend ordered some type of stir fry. The portions are huge so plan to have leftovers!!  Red Thai is a great place when you're craving Thai food but want something more unique than basic pad thai and red curry. I highly recommend trying this restaurant if you're in the area. Great affordable dishes with original flavors and a relaxing atmosphere! 5/5 stars!"}
{"text":"Okay.     Following my review for lunch, I've been here a couple of times for their happy hour cause some friends were raving about it, plus, it's fairly close.   I've had the truffles edamame,  the almond chicken, pork pot stickers, and the orange puff.    You must absolutely try the truffles edamame.   A tasty mixture of spices are added to the truffle oil and the flavors pop in one's mouth.   The sauces for the pot stickers and the almond chicken are on the mark.   The martinis of the day were the mango, which I changed from being made with gin to vodka, since I enjoy vodka more than gin, and I'm glad I changed.   It wasn't too sweet, and had just a hint of ginger.  I don't like my drinks too sweet.   Yummm!!  The martini of the day, the prior day, unfortunately, I can't remember the name.    All I remember is it was pink.   Sorry!   Our HH server/bartender the first time was Chase, and the second time Diana, whose Vietnamese name is My Lien.   Why she goes by \"Diana\" is beyond me.    She is actually a school teacher, and this is her summer job.   Too bad she can't work there all year.    Diana is especially nice, friendly and helpful.     I asked Johnny if the food is fried in peanut oil, since both of my children are allergic to nuts.     He said no, since a lot of people have a nut intolerance/allergy.   I think he said they used olive oil, but I can't remember.   So that's a good thing, not using the peanut oil for frying.  I would go back.   The only thing that bothers me, is when I am with nonAsian friends, Johnny (the owner) totally ignores me when we are having a conversation.    Should that bother me?    Dunno.     I wasn't the only one who noticed that.    Just saying. ..."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened, but we got take out recently and it was terrible. This is usually our \"go-to\" place for Asian, but not anymore. Both the pho and almond chicken were disappointing. There must be a new chef or change in kitchen staff."}
{"text":"Came in here for dinner one night. I like the place, it's got a good vibe and my beef stir fry was good but nothing to write home about. I suppose by Arizona standards, where crap ethnic food is the norm, Red Thai manages to stand out as one of the better options for Asian cuisine in the area. But if you come from L.A., San Fran, New York, etc. you're bound to be disappointed as you've been by many other Asian establishments in The Valley.   I REALLY like the bar. It is the stand out feature of the place and I think it's a shame that they close so early because I think they could do a decent business later at night with the bar crowd. I know it's a little isolated but other than North Central Sports Bar, there really is no other place nearby to catch a drink and I think these guys are missing out but not staying open later.  I would certainly be open to coming in again. If they stayed open later I would be a in a lot for drinks and late night munchies."}
{"text":"Really cute place. Pho was fantastic.  Best spring rolls I've ever had.  Great service.  The waiter was training someone new, both of them did a lovely job.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the answer to my wishes for my neighborhood! Excellent Pho, wife had the Basil Beef, loved it. Awesome decor, excellent service, killer cocktails! Cannot wait to explore more of the menu. Come try this place if you like Vietnamese, Thai, or Asian style eats in general. I wish them great success and we will be doing our part to support this eatery."}
{"text":"pleasant environment (even though in a strip mall next to a 99 cent store). food was great. spring rolls. fresh and tasty. nice sauce. coconut shrimp yummy. soup also everything fresh and flavorful. not expensive."}
{"text":"Ordered, delivered using service, and as you can see in the pictures the veggies were wilted, old and I worry would make anyone sick. I have had Pho many times I've never had basil look like this. Yes, that's basil."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I'm Vietnamese and am very picky when it comes to my pho. The staff was amazing, the ambience I love. Very clean, trendy, I just wish the food was amazing. My daughter and I had spring rolls (shrimp), pot stickers, beef pho. The spring rolls very plain. We asked for fish sauce to eat them with, they didn't have any. The potstickers weren't anything special. The pho broth was good, but I don't like the flat rice noodles they used. It is a fusion restaurant, so if you're looking for good traditional pho, this is not the place."}
{"text":"Amazing food and ambiance.   It was our first time in but already looking forward to the next.   I recommend a martini and the sweet and sour soup.   Great vibe all around and our waiter was great.   Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"My mouth is watering just thinking if the House Dynamite dish.  If I was at home, I'd lick the plate"}
{"text":"I can't believe it took us so long to try Red Thai! The drinks, food, and service were awesome! The bonus was a musical duo playing jazz during dinner. What a treat on a Sunday night. Tofu spring rolls were fresh with a delicious, moderately spicy, sauce.  But the Pho broth was the best we've had in phoenix. So full of flavor we hardly used the basil plate. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We were a bit nervous based on the location. Once inside, we were sold!  Great vibe!  Great pho and fried tofu. My parents and children loved it! Take an adventure night out here and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very relaxing, beautiful artwork and a lovely mountain view beyond the parking lot along with the soothing Thai music makes this a wonderful place to relax and enjoy your food.  I tried the ginger peach tea and Pho Thai dish. The tea is nice and cold, it seems to work well with my dish.  The Pho Thai has beef and rice noodles in a soup form that reminds me vaguely of ramen. It's gluten free since the noodles are a rice noodle, there are scallions and onions in it and it comes with a side dish that contains bean sprouts, a few jalapeño slices, some herbs and a spicy sauce dish that you can choose from to add to your soup.  It was delicious and a huge bowl so I ended up taking more than half of it home.   This was on the lunch menu so it was $8 for the soup, a great deal for the amount of food! I'm definitely coming back and bringing friends."}
{"text":"Red Thai only deserves 5 stars if a server/ bar manager named Kyle is present.  \"Customer Service\" that missing link is this young man's total focus.  He knows how to balance enough interaction without over shadowing your party.  His conversation is specific to you.  He can comment on menu items without hesitation.    If I owned a restaurant, I would hire this individual away and then insist that he train all other service personnel."}
{"text":"4 stars for Lunch...but beware the food is spicy.  Zero stars for Service...it was horrible. She came back to ask us three times what we ordered and there was only one other customer in the restaurant. I asked for a to-go box and she never brought it. 15 minutes later I asked again and she said, \"Oh do you want two to-go boxes?\" I explained I'd only need one...she brought two. When it came time for the check I was charged for a full dinner meal when what I ordered off of was the $7.95 luncheon menu. She had to go back and redo the receipt.   It's a shame since I like this neighborhood restaurant but I won't go back for lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch recently on a weekday. I didn't realize there are two restaurants that share the same door but it didn't take me long to figure it out.  I was greeted quickly and service was good throughout.  I had the lunch red curry with chicken.  Interesting take as was the first time I had pineapple in that dish. The food was good and reasonably priced.  The one thing that drops it a star for me and I probably wont go back for lunch is a lack of brewed iced tea.  I had a choice of a couple of flavored bottles or a Thai tea.  I chose the Thai tea and it was good but at $5.00 it took a reasonably priced lunch and bumped it a price point."}
{"text":"LOVE IT: Pad Thai was uniquely done with brothy deliciousness. This alone will bring me back.  Chicken lollipops were fantastic - couldn't get enough of the sauce! Our server was great - knowledgable and pretty attentive. Atmosphere was fun a gorgeous bar and three projector screens playing football (when we arrived...foreshadowing...).   LIKE IT: The Crispy Garlic shrimp and papaya salad were great. Recommend you brave it and eat the entire shell as recommended. (We compromised and ate the shell but left the heads.)   LEAVE IT: For some reason we switched from playing Sunday night football to an episode of anime... Creepy, but I couldn't stop watching. Days later and i'm still trying to figure out what happened... Not enough to keep me away though, I'll be back for more Pad Thai and some of the pho on the menu we didn't get to try.   All in all gerat experience and would recommend to people i like."}
{"text":"Love this place. This is one of those places that has that I wasn't expecting that look moment when I first came here.  Anime videos projected on to the wall and very high ceilings. Great food and drinks (martinis). Also has a nice eat at bar.  Defiantly an Asian fusion style twist to the menu.  Pho Ga soup is my favorite."}
{"text":"The best Thai Dynamite chicken I've had in Phoenix.  I was sad that I lost Sochu house and then heard about Red Thai.  Love the openness of the space inside and the minimalist decor works well here.  The Japanamation is also a fun touch on the walls.  They have martinis similar to Sochu as well as the wonderful sugar cane pork.  Red Thai, you're a little further away but worth the drive.  I can't wait for my next red martini at Red Thai."}
{"text":"Date of Visit:  12.21.16 at 6:15 p.m.  The décor is really nice / hip with great music playing.  There is a very long bar on one side, a long row of raised booths in the middle and then tables on the opposite side.  There were about 20 guests there when we arrived.  The menu was a little bit confusing at first.  Interesting that tea (i.e. the kind that the server brings to your table in a pitcher to refill you glass) is not offered - only bottled Republic Ice Tea at $4.00 per bottle.  My friend had hot tea which was loose-leaf and delicious - $4.00.    Appetizers ordered were the Port Pot Stickers (5 for $6.98) and the Saigon Egg Rolls (8 for $7.98).  The pot sticker were delicious!  Crispy without being greasy.  The egg rolls were blah!  Small - think of the little smoke sausages that you eat with tooth pics at parties and then smaller.  Overcooked - almost burnt and just no taste.    I ordered the Spicy Basil with chicken entrée - $11.98  It was a good size portion with lots of veggies and chicken; very delicious.  My friend ordered the Yellow Curry with extra veggies - $13.98.  It looked great but was almost too spicy hot to eat (and he likes spicy foods).    Service was o.k.  Nothing horrible but nothing great either.  Marissa was our server.  She was pleasant but there was really no customer service engagement...just going through the motions."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place :(   My friends and I got the Pad Thai & Thai Noodle Soup. Both were too spicy for our liking. The Noodle Soup was tasteless until I added the the oyster sauce & sirracha which made the soup even more spicy. The Pad Thai has a good balance but it was just too spicy that my friend couldn't even finish half of her plate.   The vibe is really cool & chill. The portions are very big. But I'm disappointed with the food :( Wish they had brought up a level of spicing in the get-go."}
{"text":"So glad to have found this place. We tried just about everything on the menu, and had great recommendations and service from our bartender Michael. I highly recommend the yellow curry, red Thai chicken and rice, potstickers, and pho."}
{"text":"I was really hopeful about this spot, but was rather disappointed.   The service was just ok. The waitress who served us had to ask continually over and over again what we wanted to order. I know it is loud in there, but maybe that is an issue? My friend and I specifically stated we did not want overly spicy food. Our food later came out inedible almost, due to the extreme spice level.  We did not get much of a drink refill, and the check took over 20-30 minutes, though it was not terribly crowded.   The food seemed great, beautiful in presentation. The fried tofu app was yummy. However, the curry I ordered (and said mild spice) was to the point of not even good, as it was too spicy. I love spicy, but this was over the top. I brought home the leftovers, and ended up tossing them before even getting home. The spring rolls with shrimp were delicious and well flavored, though, so there's that.   The ambiance is super cool and fun. There were videos playing on the walls, and the restaurant featured a DJ.    The parking is fine, just in a strip mall with other stores."}
{"text":"Just eh? No flavor and not the typical Thai we normally get. Spent $60 on Togo order since we were staying at a local hotel. Family didn't eat it after a couple of bites. What a waste."}
{"text":"I'd like to preface this by stating that I have never written a negative Yelp review.  I am disgusted by the way the owner treated me today. He was extremely rude, dismissive, and unprofessional.  He is currently standing in front of me at the bar, ONLY tending to two guests, and is loudly speaking about his $400.00 phone bill and why that is - \"I f*cking watch too much mother f*cking porn.\"  Hmm. Ok.  That's great. Do what you want, but please for the love of the hospitality industry and courtesy for those around you, TRY to act as though you are a business owner or respectable human being at the very least.  His style of customer service (or lack thereof) has clearly bled into the rest of his staff. Every bartender and waiter I came across was cold, inattentive, and a carbon copy of their boss.  This is the worst dining experience I have ever experienced in my life. Needless to say, I will never return to Red Thai.  I advise you all to spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"My friend recommended Red Thai. We were just there for dinner. I ordered the Ginger Chicken and my husband ordered a beef dish (Something Dragon) Both were cooked to order ... served hot with rice.  DELICIOUS is the best way to describe our opinions. The staff was friendly and attentive. We enjoyed the entertainment. The jazz vocalist who also played the flute was accompanied on keys. We will return for the Shabu Shabu and a variety of other dishes. The prices are reasonable. This is a gem of a restaurant in a rather out of the way location. I hope they are successful. They deserved a loyal following."}
{"text":"I haven't had an experience worth writing about in some time...this past weekend that changed!  My wife and I took a shot in the dark and came out with a gem, this place rocks...great atmosphere and even better food.  Small plates were so good that we never actually had an entree, we'll have to try again on our next visit.  If you have a chance, it's well worth the effort!"}
{"text":"Trendy place with a nice variety of traditional and eclectic cuisine. This place is too good for the location...which makes it perfect. Great happy hour prices, fresh and delicious food, pot stickers were great, mango martini was amazing and service was top notch. Great prices, cool projections of animé behind the bar (even if you're not an animé fan, this is still so cool and different), and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Nice Thai restaurant with a great bar area with animations projected onto the walls. Good music and a relaxed vibe.  Food was really good. We ordered the pork dumplings and coconut shrimp as a starter which were both delicious, also recommend trying the ginger fish and the red curry. They also have an interesting cocktail menu and happy hour between 3-6pm.   Definitely worth a visit if you like Thai food."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Red Thai - especially since we came based on a recommendation.   When we got there, the restaurant was quite big (open space, high ceilings, cool art). They also have a nice patio area too.  There is happy hour so you can definitely take advantage of that.  I decided to try the edamame (hh), red chicken curry and sweet potato fries (not happy hour items). The edamame was really good as they added truffle oil on them.  The sweet potato fries were good, but who can really mess up frying sweet potato fries unless you don't know how to fry?  The red curry came a little later than expected and as a regular entrée, it was not a big portion at all compared to other Thai restaurants I've gone to before.  The curry was ok - lacked a little flavor, not very many veggies, and there was probably 5-6 small pieces of chicken.  At first bite, I thought  \"eh\".   I mean yes, this place is quite hip like, and trendy - but I don't think the quality and quantity of the food should diminish. Overall, I would consider coming back again."}
{"text":"Gorgeous place.  Really trendy decoration with friendly and smily servers. I had a fried tofu appetizer and shrimp yellow curry - they were both delicious. We would be happy to come back."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! Great food, great martinis, and great atmosphere.  Not sure why they only average 3.5 stars. We go there at least once a month and it's always delicious."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! I had to go because I heard about the fun anime projected on the wall behind the bar. So fun! Great atmosphere, food is yummy and staff is helpful and friendly. They got my order wrong twice, so that's why four stars instead of five, but they were so apologetic about it, and once they got it right the food was wonderful. I had the Bun Bo salad which was awesome and my son had the best Pho Ga! The cocktails are creative and killer good. I had the Pad Thai martini with ginger and chile infused vodka...wow! I will definitely be making a trip back."}
{"text":"Great place. Kobe Pho was really awesome. Thai fried chicken appetizer was good, but basically a fried chicken leg with dipping sauce."}
{"text":"I am an anime fan and this is the coolest place I have found in arizona! I couldn't believe it existed it is just so perfect for me and my boyfriend. The food is decent but it is the perfect place to have drinks and watch anime on the big screens! It is a great idea I wish it was my business!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, Vietnamese coffee was made with hazelnut coffee but was still tasty, service can suffer if it's too busy, and there seemed to be a staff member wearing what looked like a tiny nightgown without undergarments.. I digress. If you go, sit at the bar! The booth seats are uncomfortable."}
{"text":"As a long-time resident of this 'hood, I'm embarrassed by a lot of these stupid reviews. Do not HESITATE to visit Red Thai, which to my horror I only found out about last week. If only they advertised! I have squeezed in two return stops so far. There is no Asian option remotely of this quality in the area. Anime on the walls? $5 Lychee martinis at happy hour? Look, just go and have fun. They even have a DJ on weekends. I'll update when I try more dishes when I get back from LA ... but this is an amazing, unprecedented option for these parts, rivaling the best of the Valley. And they expanded with an adjacent shabu place a couple weeks ago. Diners were practically crying with joy when I quizzed them last night during a walk-thru. Crazy!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I had the Thai salad. The salad was perfectly portioned for lunch and It was delicious  definitely coming back to this place"}
{"text":"I had high expectation for the hot pot, disappointed with the Thai Tom Yum Broth. This restaurant clearly name is Red Thai. The Tom Yum was nothing Thai about it. It was super sour, it tasted EXACTLY like sinigang (Sinigang is a Filipino soup or stew characterized by its sour and savoury taste most often associated with tamarind) if I wanted sinigang I would of asked my mother inlaw. I worked at a family owned Thai restaurant before the Tom yum broth was nothing near how it was suppose to taste like. I thought this was worst then a Vietnamese restaurant serving watered down chicken curry. PLEASE!!  invest in the time to perfect the Tom yum broth. It would of been more enjoyable if the broth tasted like it suppose too. Giving 2 stars for good service."}
{"text":"Good date spot!! Food is good, and the location is perfect ( I would say).  Definitely a must when in the area. Love some good Thai places and this is on my list of places"}
{"text":"We came in on a Saturday night. It was a little busy. The food was pricey, but pretty good. The decor was interesting, I felt like the place was a little dirty.  The pad thai is a must try. Instead of having the egg cooked into the noodles they made like a thin omlette of egg and wrapped the pad thai inside it. Different and delicious. The pad thai had special kick to it, still can't figure out what it is.  All the other dishes were okay.   The service was horrible!!! We waited for about 15 minutes after being seated until we even saw someone come by and acknowledge were there. Had to wait another 10 minutes for water. The rest of the night staggered too I guess.  Expensive and I've had better Thai food else where = not worth of another trip."}
{"text":"Only ate here once...bland. I am not a fan. Kids enjoyed their meals...likely because there was little spice in it. This is definitely not good Thai food. It's meh fusion. Drinks were good and strong...so if you're coming here for that, you'll be happy."}
{"text":"All the food we ordered were perfection. And the full bar was nice too. That and the helpful staff made this my most favorite spot for Asian food from now on."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! Food is amazing and the atmosphere is perfect!  The crispy noodles are a must have as are the goat cheese filled wontons with strawberries. We not only go there and sit but also pick it up to go."}
{"text":"We are big fans of Chef Chu's restaurants (Fate, Sens, Sochu House, etc.). His sauces are wonderful. Red Thai is no exception! Although Fate will always be our favorite of his past places, Red Thai is close to our house and much bigger, so we never have to wait for a seat.   It's a great place for family dinners or dates. They cater to a variety of tastes and diets - with gluten free and vegetarian items, and many vegan options (but are not labeled as such, so you have to ask the server).   My usual choices are the Red Thai Tofu and the Spicy Basil with Tofu. They coat the tofu and flash fry it, so it's crispy on the outside, soft inside. My husband likes the Black Dragon with tofu. I also love the Spicy Red Curry. It's a thick, almost gooie coconut milk-bases curry sauce - very different from typical Thai curry.   I've tried a few of their funky cocktails, but haven't found one I like yet. Last visit, I had the Red Kiss. It was strong, but the flavor was too savory for me. My friend had a mango-based one and liked it.  Service is usually spot on, with decent pacing and usually no errors. Sometimes Chef Chu will stop by our table to say hi, which is nice. And I can't forget to mention the anime films they usually show behind the bar. It keeps things interesting! It is a bit pricy - so not an everyday choice for us - but it's usually a fun night out!"}
{"text":"Great food had the spicy plum hot wings,  mini egg rolls w papaya salad,  sizzling tiger shrimp and Dynamite chicken all were yummy and exceeded our expectations"}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Not worth eating out for. I get the impression that the service staff doesn't enjoy working there. I saw a lot of leaning on the bar by the wait staff, and blowing his nose a lot, yikes!!! This place is overpriced for what you get. Probably no return trip just because service was not very good."}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai I've ever had and the atmosphere is upbeat, classy in a fun trend setting way.  Met friends for drinks and dinner over Christmas.  Immediately fell in love with the ambience of the setting and the Wall of Anime playing while obscure and alternative music played. Had the lemongrass soup was absolutely amazing.  They are careful with their preservatives they utilize and do not use the standard ones.  They proudly serve vegan/vegetarian choices. Can not stop going there, so refreshing for Phoenix dining.  A real experience"}
{"text":"Two side, one good dipping fun, the other fun, with nice ambience bar and music, but bland uninspired food."}
{"text":"Awesome food and atmosphere. Service was terrific. I had the Red Curry, and it was good, but I have had better at a few other places (4 stars). However, my friend had some sizzling white fish with ginger sauce, and it was terrific. We also have the edamame (app) with truffle oil/butter. My first time have edamame and I don't get why people like it so much. It was O.K.   Now the service was outstanding at Red Thai, and the bar area has a really cool feel to it. I plan to stop after work sometime and tryout the happy-hour. Overall, it was a great experience and the owner (Johnny Chu) stopped to say hello. I will definitely be back to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"Overrated hipster joint. Looks cool but food just doesn't cut it for the price. Medium quality, tiny portions.  No iced tea, which was a shock. The service was so-so. Very loud inside, and hard to have a conversation. We won't be back. Too bad, because I was excited to have a thai restaurant move into the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The bartender is the worst I have ever seen in my life. If you hate your job you should quit. I have never seen such a bad attitude or worst service in my life. I will never be back."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path in a tired strip mall, this eatery is a gem!  We had fresh, shrimp, Thai spring rolls with mint.  Yummy.  The Pad Thai and Yellow Curry with shrimp were generous servings.  Service was friendly, attentive, and quick.  There is a cozy outdoor patio.  An extensive indoor bar area with HH available at 3pm.  We did not care for the ambiance or decor, but we are possibly not the target demo; the vibe possibly appeals to a younger crowd.  We will surely return."}
{"text":"This is our second time visiting your establishment.  The first visit was amazing, food and service on point.  I was looking forward to our dinner on Friday.  I was so disappointed with my entree.  I ordered the Pineapple Fried Rice, it sounded yummy....it so was not.  The pieces of pineapple, which there were not many, we're so small and flavorless.  This dish was so bland I can not believe our server said it was a great choice.  I think this will be our last visit, there are so many great and diverse restaurants around town, I think it is time to move on."}
{"text":"It was ok. Food was below average and overwhelmingly spicy to where you can't taste anything anymore. The service wasn't great, either. It wasn't busy but the server was already forgetful of normal things like napkins and water with lemon, etc. I wouldn't ever go back. There's far superior Thai restaurants without the weird, pretentious, nerdy anime shit."}
{"text":"Food was amazing we had pot stickers and the Pho Tai with beef. Happy hour prices were good and had a good variety for the prices. I had a mango martini with my food and it was 100% the best one I have ever had. Service was good Kyle the bartender asked our names as soon as we were done which was awesome. We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Red Thai is on the St. Laurent corridor, filled with little, nice restaurants.   Red Thai has a cozy, romantic decor, with purple velvet drapes inside Thai Palace carved alcoves separated by wood carvings of kneeling Thai statues with prayer beads, appearing to hold up the columns. The theatre track lighting with orange gels creates a nice mood, and the opposite side has a full wall smoked mirror to give the illusion of space. Nice Bamboo, Hawaiian Ginger and Orchids adorn the entry.   The tables are clothed and have little plastic, pink lotus flowers in a glass bowl, with mood candlelights on every table. Sultry Diana Krall sings alluring jazz numbers and fingers her keyboard over the stereo system.   The service is timely, polite and on point. The dishes themselves are elegant, in blue and white decorated porcelain, and shaped like a duck, a leaf, etc.   The food is great. Try the Plamur, which are two calamari body halves, grilled, and sprinkled with sesame seeds, and dipped in a Thai sweet/spicy sauce. Follow the Plamur with a Gai Kang Kiew, a green chili chicken curry, with spicey red pepper slices, but not overdone with coconut milk, well seasoned and cooked just right, over your white jasmine rice. They don't have Singha Thai beer, but they do have a good wine list and hard to find Hue Beer, from Central Vietnam, or Sapporo from Japan.   Bring your date here and have a romantic evening, with good food, good service, beautiful surroundings, and Dianna Krall to get you in the mood."}
{"text":"Man what a disappointment. My first visit for lunch was amazing so went for dinner with friends from out of town and it was horrible. The service was so slow for everything and food wasn't good. Very bummed"}
{"text":"Came here with some coworkers who had a Groupon deal for lunch. Upon walking through the entrance, you are immediately met by an industrial type vibe mixed with Southeast Asian decor. There are booths, tables, and a bar, along with an area toward the back for a DJ who according to the staff will occasionally drop by to rock the 1s and 2s in the evenings. The staff is excellent as are the chefs, managed by locally renowned chef Johnny Chu.  I ordered the Pad Thai wondering how it would compare to my favorite Thai places back in OC. I can say without a doubt that RedThai's rendition is right up to par with them. The level of spice is right on point and the flavor is all there and then some. They give you a generous portion at that! For a beverage, I ordered the Thai Tea (how can you not, right?) -- again just as good as I remember it being in Cali.  It's safe to say I will be back here again, maybe for an after-work happy hour type situation."}
{"text":"Red Thai is a neighborhood restaurant and we have visited it many times since it opened. My husband and I were looking forward to eating there tonight for happy hour and were very disappointed. The bar service was TERRIBLE!!!  It took a half hour to get our drink order and another half hour for our appetizer, and that's because my husband requested another bar server to wait on us.  We finally got 1 of our 3 appetizer orders and they kept bypassing us serving people who came in after us!!!!   We felt very neglected and discriminated against.  We like to support local businesses but will probably NOT return to Red Thai because of the poor service."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, fun atmosphere! The Saigon egg rolls, papaya salad and yellow curry are sooo tasty!"}
{"text":"Their pad Thai was sorely disappointing. It was much too saucy and too sweet. It wasn't true at all to what you would normally call pad Thai.  The red Thai chicken and rice on the other hand was very good. Mostly rice than chicken (it is a cornish hen after all), but good no less."}
{"text":"Went on a date here with my boyfriend after finding a Groupon for this restaurant. We ordered Chicken Pad Thai and roast duck with vegetables. The pad thai was not very good. The roast duck was decent, but when I ordered a side of rice it was over priced and the portion was very small. In fact, all of the portions were small and overpriced, including the VERY SMALL and expensive spring rolls.   My boyfriend ordered a coke and it was very expensive and did not get free refills. Would NOT return to this place again. Especially if i had to pay full price for it."}
{"text":"The restaurant was great!  i loved the ambiance and the server that we had was fantastic!!  I will definatly go back!!"}
{"text":"Coconut shrimp, was perfection.  It was about 8.00, really great. About 5 huge shrimp. The curry was very tasty.  The chicken fried rice had a hint of pineapple.  I recommend this place. Worth it."}
{"text":"Although the bar service continues to decline with our every visit, Liliana is always a joy.  She is prompt, happy, engaging and just plain awesome with her customer-focused attitude and unwavering consistency."}
{"text":"Brought the girlfriend, her mother, herr daughter, and myself. Let me just say. WONDERFUL SPECTACULAR FLAVOR AND FOOD!  The service rocked, our food was promptly brought out. Huge portions and just delicious. The lemon grass soup awesome. The thai noodle soup also amazing. Pho GA also awesome flavor. Spicy beef basil also awesome.   Like I've iterated flavor, service, atmosphere all spectacular. We live near by so we will be back for sure.   Thank you for awesome food great service and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ambiance, decor, cleanliness, all above average, strip malls can often hide these little gems.  Only had one meal there so far - Pho with chicken.  Nice big bowls, place settings and large spoons a plus.  Service was excellent!  I want to go back soon and try some more stuff!!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this restaurant could POSSIBLY have a 4 star rating. I am a small business owner and am not overly critical, and had to review this place.  I'm not exaggerating in stating that this is definitely the worst Thai food I've ever had (from dozens I've tried), but it could be the worst Phoenix restaurant I've experienced in my 10 years in the valley (and I'm a foodie).  I got the yellow curry. Bland. So hot I burned my tongue after letting it sit for 2-3 minutes (a restaurant no-no). Absolutely no flavor. If I was to rate this dish from 1-100, it would *maybe* get two stars and only because the color was yellow. I also tried a few other dishes and sub-par would be a compliment to those as well.  I certainly will not be back."}
{"text":"This place was okay. Nice decor, but I don't think its authentic Thai food. More like fusion. My friend Sage and I ate here last night because it's in our neighborhood. We wanted to support new businesses, so we checked it out. He ordered a chicken dish that reminds him of Chinese food, and I ordered the Tofu Phad Thai. We eat Thai food all the time and have been to many different places. The Phad Thai didn't taste like real Phad Thai, and we both felt like it was missing something. We don't know if they ran out of the extra ingredients, or substitute the food with something else. Our bill came up to $36 plus tip. A little pricey for Thai food that taste like Chinese Food. As far as the ambiance, the place looks clean, they play a mixture of pop, and rock music, and the video screen has Japanese anime. So we were confused about this restaurant.  Very trendy and I didn't see any Asians except for the cooks in the back, and one waitress. It was weird! It's a restaurant for white people. I guess they are distracted by the stylish atmosphere and Happy Hour prices. I'm giving them 4 stars because the service was fast, and our servers were friendly. You know what they say... If you see tons of Asians in an Asian restaurant, you know it's good. They know authentic Asian food! This is more fusion."}
{"text":"The food is fun and flavorful but the service is lacking. Don't expect good communication or accurate and attentive service.  And what kind of a bar runs out of Chardonnay?"}
{"text":"Excellent food and large bar with happy hour. I have been here twice and enjoyed the food both times. The sugar pork appetizer is excellent. I have had it on the happy hour menu. I would recommend this place and I will be back."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood Thai restaurant, locally owned. As such I was eager to try the classic neighborhood Thai restaurant tradition....TAKEOUT! You can imagine my surprise when they refuse to let you take out anything off the lunch menu. What?! You have to order off the much more expensive dinner menu. So Pad Thai noodles for $7.98 on the lunch menu was not available to me. So I had to pay $11.98. That is insane. Just a warning if you're thinking about take-out."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I get Kobe Beef Pho here all the time! The jasmine tea is really good loose leaf also. The viet coffee is stong and amazing iced. Sometimes theres a live DJ and that's fun too. They have a poke stop inside as a bonus"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix looking for good (or at least decent) Thai food....found Red Thai. Let's start by saying I don't normally write my reviews at the restaurant, but since I have been waiting around this restaurant for more than 30 minutes I need something to do.  Al I can say is - I hope the food is good, everything else has not been OK...First we waited for SEVERAL minutes at the \"PLEASE WAIT TO BE SEAT\" (not a typo...by me) sign before we were even acknowledged, even though there were lots of empty tables...we started dreaming of Olive Garden.  We were finally greeted and given a table.  The waitress took our drink and appetizer order quickly. Of course we hadn't had a chance to review the menu for appetizers so I order the chicken satay, but was quickly told they didn't offer chicken satay (?), so we ordered the gyoza.  The appetizer was yummy, and it was fairly quickly delivered.  But then we waited, and waited, and waited for our dinner order to be taken, when I finally called her over to place the order the surprises began.  My daughter has decided on Pad Thai, but with mild chile as she is not a fan of hot food.  The waitress - who is knowledgeable, if not very friendly - advised that this was not a \"traditional\" Pad Thai, and it was one of their hottest dishes.  She could only recommend a couple of dishes that were not hot, so she recommended to go off menu with a noodle dish that is not too hot.  We ordered that unknown dish.  I typically like a green curry, but that is not offered at Red Thai (?), so I asked if the Yellow Curry was very spicy.   She said no, it was \"probably a 3.\"  Maybe I should have asked \"out of?\" Because after waiting a long time (dreaming of McDonalds...maybe the ads are right?  I might want a Big Mac...) the food was delivered and my curry was OK, but pretty bland, definitely not hot.  And I needed to request salt, which was surprising too. My daughter's off the menu noodle dish was essentially chicken lo-mein with rice noodles.    After waiting and waiting and starting my Yelp review...Overall nothing offense about the food, and it was probably slightly better than average.  BUT - the service is poor, especially the long, lonely wait just to be seated. And the menu is weird...no chicken satay? No green curry?  No noodle dishes that were not spiced?  Spice levels cannot be requested by the customer?   Weird restaurant, busily playing strange anime cartoons on the wall (so they cannot be ignored), with a weird menu.  Overall...disappointed.  I would not return (if I lived in Phoenix!).    As a review of Yelp - please let us give 1/2 stars!  This restaurant is definitely a a 2 & 1/2 Star (since the food was OK and the waitress helpful - if not friendly - to avoid an otherwise too spicy dish), but I cannot give them three stars (due to the lousy service and weird limited menu), so 2 stars it is."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! We moved to the area about a year ago and had passed by hundreds of times. Finally we went in for a visit. The bartender was extremely helpful and friendly in recommending appetizers and entrees. The cocktails and mocktails are absolutely tasty and fresh and very unique.  The vibe in the restaurant is kind of like a lounge. They have anime projected onto the wall and a fun environment. We have gone several times now and have never been disappointed with our experience and meals.  We had the sugarcane pork and it was a delicious appetizer to start out with. Then we had the pad Thai and the udon noodle dish. Both were very flavorful, filling, and prepared and plated beautifully. I would definitely recommend this place, and I hear that they have a DJ on the weekends, which would make for a fun night out!"}
{"text":"Ate here by mistake... We were wanting to eat at Shabu Fondue, but it FYI... closed on Mondays. So right next door we found the funky place RedThai.  Wow! Totally cool Tokyo vibe!.... live anime on the wall, cool Buddha mural, and really good food!   Huge Pho, delicious spicy Pad Thai and sweet and savory Sugar Cane Pork. Sapporo on draft.  And when they accidently brought chicken Pho, the boxed up the correct order of Beef Pho...  to go... No charge!   Special shout out to our fantastic server Fabian!"}
{"text":"So glad this place is just down the street! For my first trip I stuck with the basics... Martini - at $10 a bit pricy but well made! Shrimp Spring Rolls - the house Red Thai sauce was fantastic Tofu and Chicken Pad Thai - truly the best I have ever had. Now I can't wait to work my way down the menu!"}
{"text":"Interesting wall art.  Neat place, nice to see another Asian fusion place close to home.  Had the Bun Bo (spicy beef vermicelli) w/ pork pot stickers for an appetizer.  Lots of flavor, good portion size for lunch.  Definitely will try again."}
{"text":"Great night out.  Not expensive, really good food. There decoration and atmosphere in there was deff sonnet I don't see everyday, which we thought was super cool.  Service was good.  Food was great.  Prices were good.  Overall I'd say 4.25/5  We are deff going back one day.   I already recommended it to a work friend and she loved it lol."}
{"text":"If all you care about is tasty food, then this place is wonderful. On the other hand, if service is important to you, then this place is terrible. I like a laid back atmosphere, but this place was ridiculous. We came for lunch. I guess none of the other patrons needed to get back to work because the servers made absolutely no attempt to provide prompt service. I even took the check back myself to move things along. Then they didn't even apply the credit properly, so the bill had to be voided and redone. Grrrrr. Anyway, the food gets  4.5, the service gets 0.5."}
{"text":"Waited to be seated in near-empty restaurant. Waited. Waited. Staff walked past me as if I were not there. As I walked out, staff rushed to seat party behind me.  I double checked that neither my hair nor my outfit were especially scary.  If it's your policy not to serve women over 35 dining alone, just put a sign in the window or something."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere are killer! Big screens that play anime 24/7 take up half the restaurant and the food portions are big enough to satisfy any American appetite. The happy hour is only located on the patio and at the bar, which is HUGE so I doubt seating is ever an issue. The bartenders however seemed bored and disengaged. I may have been a little over enthusiastic being my first time in... But I felt as if I was bothering him and asking \"stupid\" questions by the tone of his voice. I will definitely be back, but I'll skip the happy hour and go right to a table. I guess it's true what they say \"what you pay is what you get\"."}
{"text":"Johnny Chu does not disappoint when it comes to creating hip atmospheres and delicious food. I was excited when Red Thai opened as it is close to my house, and I know he always does great happy hour specials. I have been here a few times now and some of my favorites are the truffled edamae, chicken lollipops with black peper sauce, wings and the house dynamite.  They have great martinis and asahi on draft.   Did I mention they have happy hour every day!!! There is a long bar that runs the length of the resturaunt so finding a seat has never been difficult. They have never been very busy when I have been in, but hopefully as they age that will change. Also I cannot to try Shabu Fondue when it opens next door."}
{"text":"This was our 1st visit . Food was excellent with a little bit of spice. We had pot stickers for appetizer. I had sizzling shrimp for my meal , which had gingery salty sauce on them , very very good. Service was little bit slacking , in a meaning that our server asked us if we want anything for dessert without giving us any options for it. In restaurant service you should be able to sell , there was nothing of that. They offered no appetizers , no drinks , no desserts , not sure if they gave any specials for the night , but we haven't been offered any. We will return for good food , but service should be improved."}
{"text":"I was glad to see what I thought was a new Thai restaurant in the neighborhood. The Thai food options are a little limited with standards like Tom Yum Soup, Thai Beef Salad and Pad See Yew missing from the menu. Noted under it's name is the description \"southeast asian kitchen.\" There are some clearly Chinese choices like Pork Pot Stickers and Sizzling Green Bean(s),  as well as Vietnamese Pho and Bun Bo. But there are also some less Asian sounding at least dishes like Sweet Potato Fries and Chicken Lollipops. They have made an obvious attempt to make this place a little more \"hip\" by including a huge bar and some upgraded interior design ideas versus your normal Asian decor. It seemed funny that with the enormity of the bar, we were never offered any alcoholic beverages or anything other than water for that matter. We started with the Shrimp Spring Rolls (fresh not fried) and were well pleased. The dipping sauce was spicy, sweet and had a hint of sour. Yummy! My wife had the Thai Salad with tofu and was pleased with her choice. According to her, it was spicy and she enjoyed it. I opted for the Yellow Curry with chicken and I too was pleased. The curry was the right amount of spicy and was full of ingredients that you don't normally get above the standard potatoes, onions and carrots. Mine also had baby corn, sweet potatoes, pineapple, snow peas and green bell peppers. I thought the sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes was a great choice. There was no dessert menu, but our server told us that they had Goat & Cream Cheese wontons with Strawberry puree and sprinkled with powdered sugar or Strawberry Cheesecake. No brainer right? The wontons were excellent. BUT, you only get two wontons just larger than a quarter for $5.00? Really? Although I'm not sure that Red Thai will ever be able to utilize it's ginormous bar, I hope that they will concentrate on refining the menu and ultimately improve. I know restaurant openings can be cumbersome and fret with \"bugs\" but I sincerely hope they will iron out the kinks and remain a viable option. I think cutting the bar way down and adding some additional seating would help the process immensely. (see pics)"}
{"text":"Just went there...it's awesome.  Kyle was the bartender that waited on us with drinks and food.  He is super friendly, Very informative, and creative with his drinks.  Enjoyed everything we had.'  Sugar cane pork Pork pit stickers Pho Thai (you don't get all the fixings but still good) Yellow curry Wonton dessert  All was great!!  Would recommend and also go back."}
{"text":"Probably the worst restaurant-going experience I've had in years. We were stuck waiting for our food for over an hour, largely ignored by our server even though it wasn't that busy, and my food looked and smelled so unappetizing when it finally came (and was way different than what it was described to be) that I literally didn't eat at all. Now after being here nearly two hours, we are STILL waiting for the check."}
{"text":"So I went here with a group of friends for the Drag Show on Friday night.  First off we waited for over a half hour WITH a reservation and we were getting ready to leave when they finally found a place for us.  They comped us our first round but at the prices they charge......made up for it on the next round.  I had an adequate Cosmo and the Yellow Curry was very spicy, even though I asked for mild.  It was still quite good and full of veggies. The waitress was chatting after the show ended and I walked my own bill to the bar to hurry her up.  The drag show was just okay.  Not great but not bad either.  Overall I was not impressed.  It would take a LOT for me to be enticed to go back.  Like a lot.  There are too many other places to try in a city of this size.  They just don't stand out and the service was horrid."}
{"text":"*Spoiler alert: this place is NOT able to make much of a  dish*  I went during happy hour, 3pm - 6pm, to see what this place was all about. I ordered a $3 kilt lifter and some pot stickers to begin with. Had zero issues with either menu item.   But lets talk about the decor for a second. There are these projector screens playing some type of animation behind the bar, but it's barely visible. There are like a couple of LEDs, but not enough to capture the ambience that I'm sure they wished to. It's dark in this place, which can be cool IF you understand basic lighting techniques.   So I ordered a basic Pad Thai dish and asked them to make it Firey as possible. I was thoroughly disappointed . They even had a side sauce that the bartender said \"you could buy at the store.\" What? What's the point of paying $15 a dish if they can't provide you with quality product?   I don't think that I will go back knowing their limited kitchen capabilities are so very sub-par. Too bad RedThai, I thought we could have had something"}
{"text":"In short, the food and drink are passable.  The ethics and morality with which the ownership treats its employees is questionable.  Taste sans humanity is unacceptable in our time.  Red Thai needs to adapt to its environment or seek an alternative to financial ruin.  My 2 cents.  PS The back room reeks.  Perhaps take the soup you blamed smelled of urine off your menu."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Thai place. The prices are reasonable for the great quality of the food. If you're getting takeout make some extra rice at home."}
{"text":"GROUPON BUYER BEWARE!!!  Okay, so I wrote the review as seen below before I went back for a second visit yesterday only to find out that my Groupon was not accepted for lunch as a lunch is a \"Special\" (as indicated on the fine print of the Groupon.  The waiter didn't inform me of that BEFORE running my Groupon through and marked it as: \"Redeemed.\"  So.....couldn't use my Groupon.....negated it COMPLETELY.  I made an issue of it and was told that the staff has had \"meetings\" concerning the Groupon/lunch acceptability.  Then WHY did he \"redeem\" my Groupon and render it useless?  Since when is a lunch menu considered a \"Special\" anyway?  Well, enough grousing about it - I have another Groupon for this place and will use it at dinner.  Here's my first review as published on TripAdvisor:  Went there on a Groupon with 2 others. We each ordered something different. I LOVE red curry so ordered that. The portion was huge (who doesn't like BIG FOOD?) The only ingredient missing, and I asked beforehand, was Thai basil. Thai basil notwithstanding, the curry was excellent and the right level of heat. Going back tomorrow for more. It IS a hip place like other reviewers mentioned but at the time we went there was just one person at the bar and one other booth filled. Before we left, though, another party of 4 came in. Doesn't matter......came here for the food.....not to people watch!!  C'est La Vie.....just want to warn anyone thinking of using their Groupon for lunch."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying I absolutely love this place!!! The happy hour is amazing!!! The food is to die for!! Like best ever!! Drinks are so yummy!! And the staff...oh the staff...they are my people! Noah...Kyle...Chavez...you make my world go round! Thank you for always being my weekly amazing hangout!"}
{"text":"The first waitress was not very nice! But the second one was very kind and checked in on us.  I ordered pineapple fried rice with chicken. The fried rice did not have pineapple on it... I asked and they said they cook it in pineapple juice! Pineapple juice flavor is evaporated when you cook it so that was disappointing. The food is way overpriced! It cost $12 for fried rice. The only reason I'm giving it a 3 Star is because the ambiance was really nice. I love the lay out of the restaurant. I would not come back however."}
{"text":"Come here with an open mind that Red Thai is an Asian fusion restaurant or you'll be let down like my hardcore, Vietnamese foodie father with high expectations for Vietnamese food.  Since it was lunch we all ordered a lunch special which, was a lot more food than anticipated as we could've shared everything family style.   I got the Pad Thai, mom got the Yellow Curry and dad got the Bo Luc Lac. The Pad Thai I got was made with rice stick noodles, so they were thinner and not the same noodles used for Pad Thai, it was a lot more soupy and wet versus the drier texture typical of Pad Thai. It was pretty spicy, good flavor, just wish it wasn't so wet like a soup or used such thin noodles. This came in a big enough dish to share between two or three. The Yellow Curry was typical to any curry I've tried made with chicken and best with white rice. The Bo Luc Lac my friends, is anything but that ... Bo Luc Lac is typically made with beef filet, seasoned and sautéed with onions and bell peppers served with red (tomato) rice and salt/pepper/lime to dip the meat in. This was more like stir fried caramelized meat with salad. My dad was obviously upset and felt cheated as what they served wasn't truly the Bo Luc Lac it is known to be.  The service was great, lovely waitress and the restaurant was awesome and hip. With a huge bar, booths and artwork for sale. It was interesting to see from photos that they show anime on the white walls behind the bar from the projectors. Decent prices, but like I said keep an open mind and enjoy the Asian fusion of flavors of the dishes here."}
{"text":"great happy hour appetizers, for the most part.  Not a fan of the orange chicken or the almond chicken.  I find them kind of dry.  LOVE the other appetizers.  Pork gyoza, or the chicken \"wings\" (drumsticks) are also very good, and the pineapple fried rice is always YUMMY."}
{"text":"This Thai and Asian restaurant is truly one of the best in the valley. The owner of Fate created a superb menu, using very thoughtful ingredients in the dishes that create the perfect texture, taste and balance. For example the yellow curry has pineapple in it instead of potatoes. It brightens the dish wonderfully and is not only inventive but totally works flavor wise. The lemongrass soup is wonderful and the flavor is strong as a true thai soup. I love how the dishes have strong thai basil in them. You can taste the difference. I plan on repeatedly eating here bc I need to try everything on the menu. Please note, there aren't any mild dishes. That's the only con I could come up with. I love spice, but my mom couldn't eat with me, she's sensitive to spice!"}
{"text":"Love love this place!!  Anime reflecting on 3 screens, a Big Buddha statue, when you first enter, and they have a nice long bar, for Happy Hour ($5.00 drinks). Also one can eat at the bar, to take advantage of HH prices.  (If you order at a booth or table, they do not honor the HH prices - FYI)  Wine, and Pho Ga.  Yummy!!  Any other Pho restaurant, gets compared now to Red Thai.  It's that good.  :)  Their only fault - extra rice.  $2.00!!  Really?!?  A lot of places give extra rice, for FREE!!!"}
{"text":"I love Red Thai, they have awesome Red Curry. The reason I didn't give it a 5 star review, the staff. I work nearby so we go at lunch time. They have a great lunch menu, great price, but it's dead. The staff is really good at holding up the bar with their bodies. Basically leaning on it all day. It's rare to get a smile out of them, it's more of a \"ugh, how many? sit here.\" and a dead pan face.  I don't know if they inject sleeping pills in the water or what, but getting some sort of energy out of any of the servers would be a feat. It's also going to take the entire hour lunch, because of the staff. The food comes out quickly, there's no issue in the kitchen. It's how long they wait to get your drink order, then food order, then check, it's kind of silly.  Thank goodness that damn curry is so good, it makes up for the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Red Thai shares space (and bathroom) with Shabu Fondue.  My spouse and I had lunch here on a Thursday.  I ordered the spicy Thai soup, while he ordered the Pho.  Both soups looked and tasted pretty much the same, prepared from what tasted like a powdered soup base. But for $7.98/plus tax for the lunch special you can't really go wrong, especially given the generous portion sizes.  Both of our soups were full of tender chunks of meat, served with nice heaps of bean sprouts and mints leaves. Red Thai was extremely clean and nicely decorated, and their bar looks like the kind of place people where people would hang out sipping cocktails in the evenings or weekends. We will likely be back for more."}
{"text":"I checked out Red Thai on a weekday evening for dinner after I purchased a Groupon. One of the things I enjoy about Groupon is that often you find new places you may not have visited otherwise, for example Red Thai is about 30 min away from where I live so it was a special trip. My gf and I went inside and it was dark, moody and had screens up on the wall with cartoons/anime playing. It seemed pretty cool but what was not cool was waiting to be greeted. We waited and waited, and looked around, no hostess at all and only a few staff members waiting on their tables. I actually considered leaving because in the past when my visit to a restaurant has started off this way, it hasn't ended well. Luckily a server came by and said someone would be right with us. We waited a few more minutes and a different server stopped by and sat us down with menus. I asked him if they were shorthanded and he informed me that it was only 2 servers, the 2 bartenders and no host. I've worked at restaurants in the past so I get it, they basically had 6 tables each at the moment and were busy running food, wiping down the dirty tables, taking guests orders and answering the phone, it's a lot! However, not many guests of your restaurant will be as understanding, someone else would've left so I suggest to the owners please get a host/hostess in the future. Anyhow moving along, we started with the coconut shrimp appetizer which was probably one of the  best coconut shrimp I've ever tried. We ordered the pineapple fried rice and the tofu yellow curry.  The fried rice was delicious but could not see or taste any pineapple in it so that was different. As for the tofu yellow curry, I LOVE curries!!! This one was a touch spicy for me (it is mild but tasted more like medium to me), it had a lot of veggies and tofu and was so aromatic and delicious although personally I prefer a bit sweeter. We did not have room for dessert though. Our server was excellent and attentive despite being very busy with his other guests, he was always available to us. Thank goodness, I was hoping to have a good experience here and overall we did. I don't know if I'd make a special trip out here again but if you are in the area definitely give them a try. Very good food indeed."}
{"text":"We were in the restaurant next door.  When we left I looked back and could see a giant wall of anime playing in Red Thai.  Right then I knew we would be back soon.   This restaurant has the most striking atmosphere of any Thai restaurant I have ever seen.  60 feet of anime running all along a wall.  A giant picture of a man on the back wall.  It was stunning just to look at.  We ordered the Sugarcane Pork or an appetizer.  It was great.  It looked like a drum stick.  What I first thought was a bone turned out to be the sugarcane.  The pork was wrapped around it.  I have never had anything like this but I will be ordering it again.   I ordered Pad Thai.    I always order Pad Thai at Thai restaurants.  This one tasted a bit lighter than most.  It still had a rich flavor and I enjoyed it.  There was defiantly  a little Vietnamese influence and it works.  They have a good selection of Pho as well.  I will have to try that next time."}
{"text":"Chef Johnny Chu does it again.  Every dish that our table ordered was outstanding. Make sure you get the hot and sour soup, the tofu spring rolls in rice paper, and the Papaya duck mint salad. For the wok dishes, I suggest the Hong Kong flat rice, Black Dragon, House Dynamite, sizzling shrimp, or the spicy basil. They are all good! :)"}
{"text":"I've loved all of Johnny's restaurants! I'm so happy I have one in beach cruising distance. Had the thai tea martini, fresh spring rolls, basil tofu! It was great! Loved the ambiance and Johnny was as charming as ever joining us and sharing some fun stories!"}
{"text":"Excellent - individualistic chef owned, gratifying food, and uniquely designed.  Note: The best of plaza chic - if new to Phoenix you know that it takes awhile to grasp the gems in plazas...  I don't claim nor will I ever claim to be a competent food critic. However I am confident you won't regret, if a quick check of the menu intrigues you, a moment of the experience."}
{"text":"Tofu lemongrass soup is the bomb. If u really like hot and sour soup, this where it's at. Wonderful find in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for happy hour with some friends. They have great prices on drinks and the bartender were very attentive. He remembered our names and the service was quick. I had the Pad Thai to eat and it was really tasty! I've been looking for something that was spicy and this was it. I would definitively come here again!"}
{"text":"When there for lunch on a Groupon. We had the edanami for starters. My wife had the Pad Thai whichever's she loved the flavor but was a little spicy for her. I had the Beef Crispy Noodle Island which the noodles clumped up and was difficult to break up and eat. The beef could have been more tender and a couple of pieces were cold. The truffle edanami was delicious. Portions size were perfect We've been there before with better results."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! It's close proximity to my apartment makes it a regular in my weekday takeout rotation. It's a little bit overpriced for what you get, but the food is good and it's convinent for me. I usually get the yellow curry."}
{"text":"We are having such a great time working our way through the menus at Red Thai.  They're just down the street, and having a Thai restaurant this close is like finding your favorite ride at Disneyland without a LINE!  We try to go at least twice a week.  Last night we had the Red Thai Tofu and Orange Puff Chicken for apps.  They are amazing!  The tofu is flash-fried so it has a texture almost like French Toast.  I'm not always a fan of tofu, but this stuff (and the two sauces that go with) are the bomb!  For dinner we had Spicy Red Curry and the Crispy Noodles.  I asked for extra chicken on my curry and it was no problem.  Sitting at the bar we entertain ourselves by watching the anime projected on the walls and chatting with the staff there.  Johnny, Linda, Chris, and Josie are so much fun to relax with.  Congratulations on your new restaurant!  From the soft open to the grand opening, we are loving this place and the people that make it work.  I see that a couple people have had less than perfect experiences here, but this isn't Panda Express.  This is an experience.  Trust the menu, trust the chef, and trust that you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty food. The curries are made without fish sauce or shrimp paste, so they're veg friendly. I had the red curry, and it was delicious - not too spicy either."}
{"text":"When I entered in the restaurant to pick up my take out order, I was immediately slapped in the face with the smell of bleach. Not exactly the smell I was looking for, but I figured they just cleaned the floors or something... at 6pm though? The smell got stronger near the bar, so I think they need to check their dilution ratios. The overwhelming bleach smell was very off putting right off the bat.   I was severely disappointed with the Pad Thai and Yellow Curry. The Pad Thai was nothing special, but definitely one to remember. There is no way I could have eaten more than a fourth of this dish due to the spiciness. They need to implement a spice level, if they have one, it wasn't asked. It's already 110 degrees outside, no need to make your customers sweat more during the summer! It also lacked the traditional Pad Thai flavors and was mostly noodles.   The flavor profile of the yellow curry confused me and that's never a good sign. I kept going in for more bites because I couldn't figure out if I liked or disliked it. I do have to give them kudos for loading up the veggies in this dish though."}
{"text":"I had a great dinner here on a night when I had a serious noodle soup craving. Everyone I went with loved their meal as well. The papaya salad is fantastic! It's full of herbs and a really sweet dressing. I might make this my new Sunday night dinner spot. The atmosphere is also really unique."}
{"text":"Food 4 stars & Service 1 star; Red Thai is located right on Northern and 12th Street in 99 cent Shopping plaza.    The Service was absolutely horrible, took us 20 to order and she forgot about our beverages.  Had to wave her down to remind her so we could get our initial soft drinks, nevermind refills.  Now my concern was Thai is spicy food so if you never get a refill, this becomes a dire situation.  Not the place if on Lunch hour.    The Pad Thai is very spicy, but was actually delicious.  The dish was what the server described, the noodles were perfect and the chicken was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Checked out this restaurant on Saturday with my sisters and the bf to try something new. The outside of the restaurant didn't seem inviting but once you step inside the restaurant it looks cool. The ambiance was great! There were anime series projected in the wall near the bar. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant where the booths were and it was fairly comfortable.   Our service was decent. The server gave good suggestions and was helpful with any questions we had. He checked up on us a couple times. Overall pretty cool server.   We started off with the sugar cane pork as an appetizer. They were big portions and the sauce that it was marinated in was rich and sweet. The breading was delish but the inside was kind of dry. The Bf had the Kobe Pho which was very tasty and had a lot more meat and other ingredients mixed in then we expected. It was really good. One of my sisters, had the Red Thai Chicken and rice. The chicken was  nice and crispy. The other sister had one of the specials; I don't remember the name of it but the broth was savory just a bit oily though. It had thick udon noodles with a variety of seafood. I had the spicy red curry. It was okay it wasn't what I expected. Something seemed to be missing but overall it was eh. We also all ordered Thai tea for drinks and they were good. It was very light and not thick as what other restaurants would make thai tea.   Definitely would come back to try  their other appetizers and entrees they have. :)  I actually got the chance to try Bo Luc Lac today only because the Bf brought me lunch to work and got a to go from this restaurant. The salad was delicious! The vegetables were fresh and the meat was sweet and tasty!   I probably sound like a fatty in this review tasting everything haha! I was just curious and wanted to try the different dishes :P Check the place out!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I tried Red Thai last night (Saturday) for dinner.  We walked in and were seated right away at a table.  Our initial impression is that the music is way too loud, the anime on two enormous screens is kind of weird, and the oddly long bar actually seemed to have more seating then the restaurant.  The bar goes the entire length of the restaurant with at least 30-40 seats (maybe more).  We were there from 8:00 - 9:00 on a Saturday night.  Every table and booth was taken with restaurant guests, but there were only 3 people at the entire bar when we got there - which dwindled down to one lone guest at the bar who looked to be waiting for their take-out order to be prepared.  On to the ordering.  Our waitress was adequate, but nothing special in terms of service.  We asked for ice tea and were told they don't have any kind other than bottled ice tea - which were both sweetened.  So, we declined and stuck with water.  My fiance ordered the special of the night - which was an udon dish with shrimp.  I asked the waitress what she recommended for a first timer there.  She  asked me if I like spicy food.  I said that I did, so she recommended the pad thai, so I ordered chicken pad thai.  We also ordered an appetizer of coconut shrimp.  The coconut shrimp came fairly quickly and it was excellent.  The two dipping sauces were different from what is normally served with coconut shrimp, but they were both quite tasty.  My fiance's udon dish came out next.  We thought my pad thai would be following quickly behind.  It wasn't.  We noticed several other tables near us in the same predicament - one guest with a hot dish served while the other guests (or guests) were waiting.  So, while several dishes were sitting there getting cold, other guests were stuck waiting.  And it wasn't just a minute or two.  My dish took a full 7 additional minutes to come out.  Other guests also seemed to be annoyed and kept looking over at our table.  When my pad thai finally did arrive, it was delicious.  However, my fiance's udon dish was served with tail-on shrimp.  Now, keep in mind this is a  very saucy dish.  Does the chef expect people to fish the shrimp out of the sauce, and then carefully cut off the tail on the narrow rim of the bowl?  Come on.  It was ridiculous.  In addition, cutting the shrimp left an unsightly mess along the bowl rim.  Ugh.  When the waitress came by to check on us, I asked her how the chef anticipated people to eat the tail-on shrimp in this dish.  She said, \"I don't really know.  It's just how he does it.\"  So, while the food was tasty, there were problems with this restaurant.  They appear to be trying too hard to be something that they're not.  This isn't the Biltmore area.  This is a strip center restaurant between the Ace Hardware and the 99 Cent Store.  The service was marginal and the timing of our meals out of the kitchen was not acceptable.  When we asked about the tail-on shrimp, that would have clued in any experienced server that there was a problem.  This waitress practically chastised us for questioning the chef's decision.  For these reasons, you've been chopped."}
{"text":"Did not offer the lunch menu until I asked for it. No substitutions allowed on items.   I did not stay."}
{"text":"Great service! Showed up around 6-7pm on a Wednesday and was seated right away. Ordered a cucumber cocktail and chicken spicy red curry. The dish had plenty of veggies and chicken . No complaints at all! The spice was between 1-2 Thai hot (I love spicy food, may be too hot for others) my cocktail however wasn't terrible but wasn't on point. I still would highly recommend for others to try out this place!!! Environment was relax, dim, with a wall dedicated to inaudible anime playing."}
{"text":"This a hidden gem in Phoenix.  The place has a modern feel to it.  The food is fantastic, in particular the Sugar Cane Pork, wow, delicious!  All the food we had was incredibly tasty, service was great, and the martinis were superb.  I definitely be coming back to this place, as it has a wonderful atmosphere, awesome background music, great food and phenomenal drinks!"}
{"text":"First time having dinner here last night. We had hot pot and got the ying and yang which was picking two different broth. I thought that was cool having to pick two different broths in case you and whoever you decide to eat with dont like to have what you chose. We had the japanese miso soup and the Tom Yum for our broth. The miso was delicious! Although the Tom yum tasted exactly like my mom's tamarind soup which was a bit strange but I didn't mind cause it was still tasty.. We also got shrimp, shabu beef, mussels, baby bok choy, fish cakes, and udon noodles on the side. They were all fresh and so yummy. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"Johnny has done a great job, which was unsurprising to my husband and I who were long time Fate enthusiasts when we lived downtown.  We're glad to have Red Thai within walking distance now.   We ordered the Bo Luc Lac salad, a sesame chicken appetizer special, potstickers and Crispy Noodle Island.  Everything was cooked to perfection and delivered in a timely manner.  Our server was courteous and personable and the surroundings are very hip and fun.     Note to the wise: If the sesame chicken wings are a special when you go, I'd certainly recommend them!"}
{"text":"The prices match the well-presented ambience, great bar, very friendly and attentive staff, but four stars only because I have \"had better\" taste-wise. Regardless, I will visit this place again for sure and definitely recommend it to visitors and friends. Assuming I have different entrees this place can definitely be 5 stars in my book. It's very unique and well-presented as is though."}
{"text":"Extremely rude service; extremely disappointing and overpriced pad thai.  Two friends and I were looking for places to go for dinner and from the street this looked cute and well patroned.  We were seated quickly, but were not addressed by anyone for another 10 minutes.  The food took forever to come out and my pad thai seemed to have been drenched in pepper ... that or they spilled the pepper mill into the pad thai, I don't know.    The service was the worst I've ever experienced in many trips to Montreal -- it was as if the waitress intentionally tried to piss us off.  I took it as a prejudice against anglophones, but no idea really."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for the first time, and we had a really nice experience. Staff was friendly and attentive, the food was excellent, the ambiance was great, music kept the mood upbeat. The price was extremely reasonable; Two entree's and an appetizer for under $30! My wife and I are both set to come here again next time we visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to trying Red Thai for a long time. I am a fan of Sochu House and Tien Wong.... unfortunately, this was essentially Sochu House. The menus have a lot of the same dishes... the difference? I live right near Sochu House and fairly far from here. I just wish if they were going to have two of the same restaurant, they would just call them the same thing... or at least have a website (I couldn't find one when I was looking) so I could've seen their lunch menu. Anyway, the food was good, I enjoyed it, but it wasn't Thai food (which was what I wanted). Anyway, if you live close to here, go here... if you don't, you may as well just go to Sochu House.   PS this place doesn't have the best sochu item... the soup dumplings.  PPS The service was friendly PPPS This place has a weirdly long bar that is against a large plain white wall.... it looks sort of unfinished."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious! Ordered the dynamite with chicken, red curry with chicken and Thai basil with chicken. Each dish had amazing flavors! Not much of a dessert selection, fortunately we brought our own cake to celebrate a friend's birthday. Service was good too, we didn't realize what time they closed. They still seated us with 20mins until kitchen closed and asked we ordered all our food at once, which wasn't a problem. I would highly recommend this place, great food and ambiance!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was awesome and really enjoyed the great isomer service. We had the Yellow Curry and Papaya salad. The yellow curry was spot on and the papaya salad was out of our normal food ordered but was surprisingly great and nice change of pace. It is a little more costly but combine that with a cool atmosphere and great friendly and attentive customer service = totally worth it. We will definitely be coming back.   Oh also, the Vietnamese coffee was nice having a strong iced coffee that was smooth."}
{"text":"Dear fiery, shrimp Gods bestowing your friendly deshelled deliciousness upon us....thank you. We have been chasing the Sizzling Shrimp dish at this  place since it was Sens...then Sochu House...and here. Must try for any chili lover!  You'll get seconds!   Other then that service ALWAYS on point, martinis always fab, and the dj and pg-13 Anime wall make this place a one of a kind hot spot!  If you are still reading this you should be driving here now!   Try 3 to 4 appetizers to sample for yourself, I suggest the soup goyza, truffle edamame, and hot and sour soup....and a martini.... Of course"}
{"text":"This place had a really cool looking ok inside super urban and hip the food was great would definitely eat there again"}
{"text":"red thai southeast Asian kitchen has horrible customer service, unfriendly and standoffish service made us leave before we even taste the food \" because the boy behind the bar didn't take the time to explain himself that the appetizers that we had wanted were not available to us.... WE WERE ONE OF ONLY THE TWO TABLES IN THIS PLACE AND HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT WE WERE AN INCONVENIENCE TO HIM...  (keep in mind that my fiance that is PREGNANT  CANNOT SIT AT THE BAR)"}
{"text":"The moment you walk in you think to yourself. .. where am I!? Is this place really here?  The ambiance is beyond FABULOUS!  FINALLY good Thai food in this area.  All the food is fresh and tasty.  Everything is bursting with full flavor, and Great staff. Thank you Chef Chu for bringing this wonderful jem to this location.  Looking forward to your fondue place to open up! =D"}
{"text":"The food was great but the portions were small. I got the black dragon or something like that. It was REALLY good. They were showing some kind of anime on three huge projectors, and the show was really weird.   The restaurant was decent, but there are much better similar places in Phoenix. It wasn't bad, but not worth going back."}
{"text":"Good food! They have gluten free options and non spicy for this of us who enjoy the flavor a but can't handle the spice. Staff was very friendly too."}
{"text":"Does Johnny Chu know who's greeting his guests?  Took my wife and toddler tonight -- instantly given a dirty look when I asked if they had a high chair.  \"You're looking at a 20-minute wait, at least\" said the abrasive hostess. \"Would you like to wait?\"  \"Yes, we've been looking forward to your restaurant opening. We live down the street! Why such a long wait? I see at least ten open tables...\"  \"Oh, it's part of our grand opening. All of these tables are reserved,\" said the hostess.  [thirty minutes elapse. DJ in the booth cranks techno mashups from his Macbook Pro. Japanese anime triple-projected on the white wall behind the bar]  I politely checked back in, and the hostess gave me attitude, again. In a demeaning tone...\"another ten-to-fifteen minutes.\" I solicited for some basic empathy considering that we have a hungry, and increasingly ornery kid.  She repeats: \"I said, another ten-to-fifteen minutes.\"  Half of the tables retain \"reserved\" status. We probably would have been finished with our meal by now. It was obvious we were not wanted. Especially after my daughter pitched her sippy cup on the concrete floor and got the stink-eye from the mixologist.  We drove to 19th ave and enjoyed a meal at one of our favorite, family-owned places -- Thai Lotus.   Johnny... WTF?"}
{"text":"The weird double entry confused my wife, but she eventually figured it out. They also had no one at the hostess station.  We only waited a few minutes but standing there unacknowledged is super awkward for any amount of time. After that our service was just a little slow and he didn't know the menu totally but it was fine. The important part, the food. It was really great and the servings were large. We shared the edamame, which was a little greasy,  but pretty reserved on the truffle. Those went fast. My kid had the gyoza as a meal but I didn't get to try one, she basically inhaled them. I had the lemongrass tofu soup. Let me stop there,  they have tofu options on lots of the dishes but also a few that are made to be veggie, like the one I ordered.  That's a nice touch. My soup was rich, spicy and flavorful.  It had plenty of tofu and so many noodles I couldn't finish it. 5 stars on food for sure. Everyone else liked their food as well. The specialty martinis rock, we all ordered them and loved them. I had the Thai tea one but I only ordered one because it was so delicious I drank it down instantly. I had to switch to beer.  I will agree with the other reviews and say it's a little pricey for what it is but not horrible. The setting is cool, with the industrial feel and anime on the wall. The downside- the high ceilings combined with whatever A.C. system they had resulted in it being incredibly muggy. It was a monsoon night so maybe it's better when it's not so humid. I'll return and see."}
{"text":"Soup Goyza is amazing! The amount of flavor and broth that's served with the goyza is something you'll be addicted to, gown size is there aren't enough served. The pad Thai is delicious and the portions are enough for two! The environment is artsy anime meets trendy Asian."}
