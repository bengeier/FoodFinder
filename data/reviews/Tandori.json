{"text":"Great butter chicken.very different than the regular sweet ones you get elsewhere. Very friendly counter staff. It's real value for money.try their mango lassi,it's yumm."}
{"text":"I am surprised by the comments from Dave and the other person. The concept is very unique and getting Indian food in a fast food envoirnment is wonderful. I have had food there quiet a few times and find it very flavorful. If you are looking for Indian food, be prepared to get a little grease. The naan bread is not a good one till it is drenched in lot of butter and so is the case with other curries. I don't think the sauces are out of the packet as it tastes really good. I like the korma the best. Also go for the mango lassi which is amazing. It seems to be a little pricy but the quantity of the food does justice. You cannot compare Tandori with a five star restaurant food but for a food court Indian food,it is great."}
{"text":"-their salade is just uneatable , is like they opened a can of cheakpea and put it in your plate . -their Naan bread has nothing to to with the real Naan , its like wet and re-heated. -i can give them some credit for the cari."}
{"text":"Horrible, over-priced food. I ordered a butter-chicken wrap. What I got:  soggy, buttery pink rice inside a tiny wrap with one chunk of cucumber.  I was already regretting it when I saw the girl behind the counter making it. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"I had the butter chicken. Very creamy, but very lacking in spices and flavour. The rice was dry (no saffron option) and the added naan bread is identical to the one you can get at Costco.  The combo was 7.99 + tax, and the naan was a 1.50 on top.  I might have expected too much from a food court Indian food, but Amaya at the Eaton center food court is amazing.   I'll make sure to walk a block south over to Suski Biryani on Hayden St. for butter chicken, 2 veggie curries, and rice at 6.99 + 1.99 for extra delicious naan."}
{"text":"Blurgh. Terrible. Believe the bad reviews. On a positive note, the basmati rice was properly cooked."}
{"text":"I was really hungry and needed some food quickly . They ran out of biriyani so took the three item thali . I have never tasted something so bland in my life .   Only pros the girl who gave was nice .   They give you frozen pita in place of a naan . For me why even bother because I  won't eat it .   Don't waste your money"}
{"text":"Located in the Eaton Centre food court, their portions are smaller comparing to other fast food restaurants for about the same price. The food is just slightly warm when served and cooked probably days ago. The Butter Chicken and the Tandori Chicken tasted pretty good."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but it fell terribly short.  I tried the 3 dish selection ... had the butter chicken, the spinach dish and the beef... with rice, salad, naan, and potatoes... I ate the salad, rice and butter chicken. I couldn't  stomach the other choices and I usually am able to eat even though I don't particularly like the taste.  The butter chicken was ok and the naan was soft.  I didn't finish the naan cause I tried to put the potatoes and beef in it to see if that would help me eat it.  I took a bite and didn't finish the rest.  I am not an Indian food expert ... I just like good tasting food lol.  I have eaten Indian food before so I have an idea of what good Indian food is and this was not it.  The staff member was very friendly though, but I wouldn't go back ... I don't want to say it was BAD, it just was not worth the calories..."}
{"text":"It's taste great. Butter chicken(a little bit creamy, still good, no spicy. I like it)."}
{"text":"I agree with Dave R. about almost everything. Not a lot of selection, extremely oily and bland, and more expensive than what you could get at a lunch buffet. The reason there is always a line is because it's inside an office building, very convenient to people working there.  I will not give it the extra star though, because even though it is presented as \"fast food\", there is no excuse for it to taste this bad. They really cut corners on the quality and quantity of the ingredients, and it shows."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what I'm eating... it's curry. I ordered Butter Chicken......But it doesn't taste like any other Butter Chicken I've had before. So bland.   One small cup of curry, with one small naan is $7 after tax. I would have been happy with the price if it was tasty."}
{"text":"Got premium curry...... tasted flavorless..... also first time think basmati rice tastes like hardboard paper shredded into small piece ..."}
{"text":"I arrived after lunch when only the mall workers were here shoving their food down on breaks.I had the tikka chicken.The flavor was ok but some pieces were a bit chewy with poor cuts of meat.The naan was tasted like it was frozen and reheated.The basmati rice was cooked nicd.The mint chick pea salad was not good.I ate a few bites and gave up lol.I ate half of my meal and tossed the rest.It came with with green sauce that I didnt like or could identify.The staff was very nice despite the food."}
{"text":"In the world of food courts, my expectations are typically low. Truth be told, I generally steer clear of them all together. But I needed a quick bite to eat and decided to give this place a shot.  I settled on a Butter Chicken Wrap w/ 2 sides, which is $7.49 + tax. The wrap is a piece of naan with some rice, tomato, onion, and sauced up meat of your choice (butter chicken, curry, tikka masala to name a few). I got them to throw a bit of lettuce on it too. The butter chicken was decent but basic. The guy working asked if I wanted it spicy, but despite my confirmation of such interest, it was not spicy. In fact the flavours of the butter chicken could've been more pronounced on the whole. Regardless of this, I'll give it credit for being something different from the typical wrap or pita joint. For sides I went with masala potatoes and some sort of sauce up peas. No complaints or raving compliments on this stuff.   For a meal just under $8.50 after tax, I was appeased with my decision. In fact for being somewhat unique, I even considered a 4 star review. But in the end, it's still just food court food. But if you're looking for something a bit different, it's worth a shot."}
{"text":"Maybe not the best Indian,but whenever my craving for chicken Korma hits and I'm near here,this us where I come. So far,so good; the food has always been piping hot and tasty. I would however,appreciate more salad than starch with starch..... potatoes AND rice on the plate. Overall though,pretty good for fast food."}
{"text":"Notre film était dans 15 minutes, on avait pas dîné, et maudit que je suis difficile quand vient le temps de me choisir de la bouffe dans un food court. Je fais le tour de tous les resto, passe devant le Tandori, ça a l'air intéressant, mais ha le vie&nam servent des plats a la citronnelle? Oooh ou du Thai Express, j'en ai pas mangé depuis au moins 3 ans!... Je mange tellement jamais dans les centres d'achats, par préjugés - peur de dépenser mon argent sûrement gagné dans de la nourriture que je juge sans connaître médiocre et pas bonne pour mon petit corps tout fragile. J'hésite quelques secondes et puis ha, ça fait longtemps que j'ai envie d'un cari, je plonge.  Cari aux pois chiches, riz, pain naan et samosa. Le samosa était froid et pas épicé convenablement, grosse déception. En même temps, depuis que j'ai goûté aux samosas parfait de Traiteur Guru mes papilles gustatives sont rendu snob niveau samosa, y'a rien à faire pour détrôner ceux de mon chef indien préféré. Sinon, j'ai été agréablement suprise par le reste de ma commande. Le pain naan goûteux, chaud, légèrement grillé et TOUT DOUX, dans le genre expérience multi sensorielle c'était complet. L'assiette de cari était bien garni, le riz était bien cuit et goûtait super bon, tout comme le cari qui était juste épicé comme je les aime. J'ai été sincèrement surprise par la qualité du plat, genre que j'ai déjà mangé de l'indien plus degueu pour plus cher, et la je suis dans un food court et j'ai de quoi de super bon pour 6$. Va falloir que j'apprenne a laisser mes préjugés alimentaires de côté plus souvent."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is still in business. Butter chicken was horrible, there were 2 pieces of chicken, if tasted burnt and the sauce  was bland and not spicy. Don't waste your money here. You can buy a bottle of butter chicken sauce from the supermarket and it will taste 100 times better."}
{"text":"Wow, it wasn't until I came here that I realized you can screw up Indian food so badly.  I really should have known better and read the reviews but I really had to grab something quick during my lunch hour as I wasted a good part of it at Dollarama in that same building, waiting the long line.  In any case, I had the \"classic Indian bowl\" and it was horrendous.  I ordered the paneer and I have never tasted such watery paneer in my life.  The cheese cubes were the size of my finger tips (I have small fingers) and I counted a total of 5 cheese cubes in that bowl of stuff.  The rest of my spinach mixture was watery, salty, and gross.  It was such an epic waste of calories.  Definitely go to Matagali's nearby instead"}
{"text":"Part of the food court in Eaton Centre. Not authentic but its pretty good. I like the mango lassi, not that thick and easy to slurp. Decent price for meat over rice with two sides. Two drinks and a entree all under $17. Only downside is the menu on the wall is all in French with no English. Other than that it satisfies your cravings. The lassi balances out the spiciness so make sure to get one."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a rice and chicken dish. Very simple choice, can't go wrong. Tasted super bland. I found some cartilage parts in my chicken. I had to discreetly spit them out. Mango lassi was okay. Friendly service. Not authentic or anything. Skip it."}
{"text":"Would give negative stars if possible. The girls at the counter were so rude. Took them ten minutes to serve me when I was the only one there as they were busy on their phone.  Chicken wrap had chicken that was so raw that it almost flew away. Channa masala tasted like the chickpeas were still raw. Saag paneer had NO paneer, just mushy uncooked spinach boiled in some oil. And this cost me close to $20. Should have stuck to the $5 happy meal from McDonalds would have been much better choice. This is NOT Indian food. Actually, this is not food. Please save yourselves from this horror."}
{"text":"Greasy.  Oily.  Watery.   Bland.  Expensive.  Most likely pre-packaged sauces on cheap cuts of meat.  I will say, the butter chicken was awesome, but the beef curry and chicken curry are lacking.  And wheretf is the vindaloo?!  No lamb, no goat either.    The naan is fresh at least, but it's still not quite up to par.    The salad isn't really a salad.  It's more like a shredded burger topping with VERY american dressings provided.    When it opened, I was quite excited to check it out.  The line up was huge, and the smell was amazing.  Having a fast indian food place at the bottom of my elevator at work was a great idea!  I told my ex-gf about it, and that I was excited.  She took that as a recommendation and tried it for herself.  Now, she is certainly an Indian food connoisseur, with at LEAST 2 months of experience with Eastern cuisine at the time of this writing.  She complained to no end about how terrible and \"phony\" everything was.  While I'm certainly inclined to agree, I'm adding an extra star to my rating for making her meal terrible.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Tandori! A good place to get some reasonably priced Indian food downtown.  Price: for 8-9 dollar you should be satisfied, it's downtown so that's normal.  Quantity: you get a decent amount of food. So far I've had their Biryani and 3 curry combo. For 1.00 more Biryani comes with 2 sides and it's worth it. They also put some yogart and fried onions on the Biryani for you. Curry combo comes with 3 Curry's of your choice, white rice and nan. Enough to satisfy someone but the curry is watered down in my opinion.  Customer service: Based on my experience, there's nothing special there. Not fantastic but not bad either, just \"okay\"  Quality/taste: well it doesn't taste like authentic Biryani, I guess they make it so that the people who cannot handle heavy spice can enjoy it. It's a bit on the mild side however it's full of flavor especially if you get some gravy on the Biryani."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with this Tandori. Overpriced and the meat quality was subpar. The staff was uninterested and unfriendly. Strangely, the one we had in Quebec city (now closed) was much better: free side dishes, better meat and welcoming staff. It used to be my all-time favorite indian fast food, but will probably never return."}
