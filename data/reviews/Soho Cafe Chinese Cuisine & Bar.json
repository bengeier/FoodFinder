{"text":"Well I went back of course to get my Sesame chicken (white meat only) fix and my friend ordered the Sa Cha Chicken and Broccoli.  Both were SUPER quickly prepared and perfectly cooked.  We hung out and talked and didn't feel rushed on a Monday night...We both ordered water, so no repeat of the canned drink mess from last time.   Still a fav...always a fan!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout based on my fellow Yelpers' reviews.  That would be a big fat no.  Maybe you have to eat at the restaurant, but the Blackened Chicken (not, by the way) was inedible.  The Ginger Salad which didn't contain any, but consisted of iceberg lettuce a few shreds of old carrot was $4.  Bleh."}
{"text":"No question, this is our favorite Chinese food anywhere in Charlotte.  Jack's hot-and-sour soup is the best going."}
