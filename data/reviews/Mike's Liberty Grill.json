{"text":"Way overpriced for the quality of food.  $13-$14 for a wrap and fries?  And like someone else mentioned earlier I don't why the mix the sweet potato fries with the regular french fries.  For this price there are alternatives with better quality such as Aroma, Athletes Kitchen, Paramount.  I would even go as far as to the say the hot lunch at Metro is better for half the price"}
{"text":"THANK YOU Mike!! I no longer have to put up with the lousy service and wallet hurting prices  at School, nor the same standard fare a Druxy's -- love the cafeteria style, love the variety ... REALLY love the price ... butter chicken for lunch is a treat!! $10 goes a long way for lunch ... I'm stuffed, or I have leftovers for dinner!  Good luck with the opening month growing pains!!"}
{"text":"i eat here for lunch about once a week for months now. I think you definitely get more than what you pay for. 

The food tastes amazing, and I've only ever received really fresh ingredients (ex salads crunchy fresh, beef excellent flavour, etc). They give you a LOT of food too. 

For example, last week I ordered the salmon on steamed veggies expecting a boring healthy blah meal, and the salmon was massive, like the size of 2 8oz sirloins, perfectly cooked, great simple seasoning, and the veggies were so fresh and flavourful. 

Their salads are brilliant, especially the steak and mushroom one, and the dressing never has that 'kraft' taste, I'm not sure if they home make it but it tastes like it and that's good enough for me! 

It's hard enough to get a tasty, healthy meal for only $10, AND be full afterwards. This place pulls it off perfectly. 

In my experience it's always freshly cooked, non leftover'y, non greasy, high quality ingredients. I honestly have never had a complaint about the food or service, nor has any of my co-workers who come here as often as me.

I've also always found a place to sit with 3 other people in tow at peak lunch hour, it's big enough, tables always clean, ordering is easy, they bring you your food if its not ready immediately.  easy easy easy."}
{"text":"Very rude staff. Didn't even get a chance to try their food because apparently we aren't allowed to take pictures of the menu to show people who work in our office in the area. They just lost a lot of business."}
{"text":"They need to shave off a couple dollars if they want to bring back the crowds, it's a little much paying nearly $14 after tax for a small wrap and fries. 

However the food is good and it's in a very convenient location if you work nearby. If I was rich this would be a 4 star place, but I can't overlook the huge markup on the food"}
{"text":"I'm the kind of a guy that loves having a good breakfast rather then always going to the local fast food chain. I decided to give Mike's a try for take out. Liberty Grill has a comfortable feel to it. Selections for breakfast was good, carrying everything from the Bacon and Eggs to French Toast. Seating is available indoors and they do have small patio for those that would rather enjoy their meal outside.

Positives:
- Food is what's to be expected for a Grill
- Customer Service
- Comfortable Feeling
- Patio

Negatives:
- Cutlery had to be picked up separately. I expected it to be packaged with the meal since it was take out.

Neutral:
- Bacon was crunchy. I don't mind it that way but others may not enjoy it so much."}
{"text":"Staff was neither pleasant nor rude, but was more or less efficient and I got in and out in a good amount of time. The food was no good though. While it was a good portion, it was pricey. I ordered the Guac Chichen Wrap, but the wrap quickly fell apart, and barely had any guacamole. In fact I could only tell there was guacamole because there was a green watery runoff at the bottom on the wrap container. It had the consistency of soy sauce. Additionally the fries with me meal were a mix of regular and sweet potato fries, which was an example of two decent foods combining to make a worse food. I learned my lesson and will brave the longer line of the Druxys next door next time."}
{"text":"Very hit and miss. 

Ordered a bacon and egg sandwich... Wasn't toasted... And came with..mint?

I keep giving them chances, but they always let me down."}
{"text":"I work in lib village and eat here occassionally. Its fast convenient and made in front of you but its pretty pricey. Usually i get a blt and fries/salad for 11$ or a chicken  ceasar salad i think its  $11-12. Good every one in a while but there are lots of other options in the area."}
{"text":"I've never written a review before, but the horrible service I just got made me so angry. And I'm a frequent customer at Mike's!

I understand that it is busy, but it'll be nice if this place just listened to it's customer's orders.

Their lunch \"hot plates\" are all a bit pricey - at $10+ a plate. Not bring very hungry, I wanted to just order 2 items, which amounts to about $7. I clarified it with Mike's wife and proceeded to order with her.

Now my plate was passed down the assembly line and a salad was stuffed on. I told the lady that I only wanted two items, no salad, not the combo. She said it's fine since she did it already. The salad would be free of charge.

Now when i went to pay, they charged me $11. I explained to them that it was a 2 item plate, but no one understood. Mike came by and spoke to me like I'm stupid and can't understand what's a lunch plate. Mike's wife came by and said it's a lunch plate and that's what I ordered. They even tried to convince me that I'm getting the salad for free and that it's a great thing they are doing. I had no choice but to get the entire plate cause the line was being held up. They won't listen to my explanation and just kept shouting at me, opening my lunch and pointing to the food. So embarassing!

I've come to expect that i'd be hustled in and out, but really, can't they just listen to me for a second?? If they only serve entire combos, then I'll get the entire combo - don't lie to me and then charge me."}
{"text":"I've been to this cafeteria before and I think today will be my last.  Usually the service is great and the food is ok.  This time around I watched the 'cook' char my burger.  While I am watching him he starts to pull the center of it out... i'm assuming so this will cook faster. But with the flames and the cheese I wasn't certain that's what was going on.  I got my burger walked to the door and took a look at what I got... I was missing the entire center and a side to the burger.  I then took it back and showed the owner and told him what I saw.  

Ok so now I'm getting a new burger and this time it's done proper, right?!  That would be too easy to cook an effin burger properly.  this time the center was torn up pieces missing covered in cheese to hide.  

If you can't cook a simple burger you really should think about closing your doors... it was pathetic!

Thanks,

Liberty village employee!!"}
{"text":"Worst service in Toronto. The owner, a Guyanese guy, was rude and it was chaotic and the line up was out the door. ATM machine broken. No parking. If you want good food , go to School Cafe across the street. My chicken parm was cold!!!
I give this place a score of minus three. Not worth their slightly expensive prices."}
{"text":"Mike, ex of Warehouse Grill, has opened Mike's Liberty Grill, a cafeteria-styled diner in the west-end of Liberty village (across the street from his old stomp at Warehouse) and it's with mixed feelings that I report that the Liberty Grill benefits and suffers from all the same woes as Warehouse did, without the ambiance.

Positives:
- the food is good, not superb, but reasonable value for the $

Negatives:
- no table service
- chaotic ordering/point of sale process
- frequent screwups with orders because of chaos
- inadequate seating

They've only been open for a few weeks, so hopefully they can overcome some of these negatives, but I fear, given that the Warehouse grill operated with the same chaos for _years_ that this is just Mike's style.

Much like Warehouse grill, I doubt I'll go back - at least not when they're likely to be busy."}
{"text":"never had a meal here i enjoyed, one of the worst places in lib. 
Prices too high for what you get, food bland, focus on doing a few things right instead of everything wrong"}
{"text":"I don't usually post negative reviews but I have to let the quality of the customer service be known. I ordered a village Greek chicken salad. And first of all when the lady started mixing I requested no tomato's, she responded that she had already mixed in the tomato's in and I said that it was fine because I'd be able to just pick them out. A man appears from the kitchen, who I could only assume is \"Mike\" and he orders her to make another one. He tells me \"a Greek salad is made up of olives tomatoes and cucumbers\" and I'm like \"...I know that.. Im just usually able to request no tomatoes.\"
So as he's cashing me out, I see the lady add Parmesan cheese... on my Greek salad. I just point out \"isn't it supposed to be feta cheese?!\" And they respond that feta cheese goes on top. I was confused because I've NEVER heard of Parmesan cheese on a Greek salad. I just said that Ive never had a Greek salad with Parmesan cheese. And mike looked frustrated. \"Do you want us to waste this one and make you ANOTHER one?!\" I was literally shocked at his little outburst. I'm like no it's fine I'm just really confused about- and he cut me off. \"You see if you look on the menu we have the ingredients under the actual salads.\" He was talking to me as if I was stupid. I was silent. Said my thank you and went off to look at the menu board. And would you look at that? No mention of Parmesan cheese in the village Greek salad!! I went over to let him know that the Parmesan in the Greek salad is not advertised as he said that it was. And he repeated \"do you not want this one?! Do you want us to make another one??\" I replied no this is fine I was just letting you know that Parmesan is not listed as one of the ingredients as you said\" he said okay and brushed me off. I'm angry because something that wasn't a big deal turned into something that reflected the impatient and graceless customer service. Good chicken but bad service. Don't get all West Indian on me and think I won't get West Indian back. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Hm, I guess my experience here was not the norm. I really liked the food & service. Went during the rush lunch hour and got my chicken tikka wrap within 10 minutes, which I count as a win. Sure, the person at cash wasn't bubbling over with enthusiasm, but the place had a huge line-up and no AC so who could blame her? The wrap was divine, though it could have been spicier. The salad had little shreds of mango - not your run-of-the-mill pre-packed side salad. My only complaint is that the whole meal cost me $11, which is a little beyond my general price range for a lunch. That said, the quality was good and Liberty Village has pretty high rent, so I will probably be back to treat myself in the near future."}
