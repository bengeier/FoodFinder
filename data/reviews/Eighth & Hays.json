{"text":"We found this place on the Yelp app and it has  nice decor and feel. Service was enjoyable too. Had a meat and cheese charcuterie board, bubble bread, swine wood oven pizza and the 'luv jug' dessert of the day. We enjoyed it all except the bubble bread was only mediocre. Wouldn't get it again. The charcuterie board was really good. The house made pickled grapes 'tasted like Christmas', as our server said! The pizza was just right too. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! We love this place!! I recommend avoiding the boards- you don't get enough food and the cheese selection is dissapointing. BUT they have tons of other good stuff. The mac and cheese is insane. The salads are surprisingly awesome too! Also, great cocktails and wine selection. This place is perfect for date night."}
{"text":"This was such an amazing place for me and my girlfriends to celebrate my birthday! The service was amazing! Our server was Josh and he was super attentive to our large table. The pizza, drinks and sandwiches were all delicious and we couldn't have been in a better atmosphere. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan! Stopped here to have dinner. We had the margarita and mushroom pizza, plus a salad. I found margarita to be a bit bland (the cheese was not the most flavorful, but the tomato sauce was great), but still very good. The mushroom pizza was heavenly! Would eat that pizza everyday!! Make sure you try it if you go here."}
{"text":"I'd probably give it 3.5 stars if that was an option, but this place definitely deserved more than 3. It was a cute spot, the apps were good, they have good happy hour specials, our waitress was friendly, and the love jugs had a ton of toppings that made them delicious. The entrees were good, but nothing amazing. I ordered a filet special that was topped with a fried egg. I ordered my filet medium, but it was definitely a medium well. The asparagus with my steak was a little too lemony. While I enjoyed all of the toppings on my love jug, it was a little too thin and too much milky. I would definitely recommend Eighth & Hays for happy hour for drinks and apps."}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  Beautiful, modern decor and ambiance, great food/wines, and superior service.  I visited with a party of 3 for my girlfriend's birthday and we were able to sit in a sort of loungy area of the restaurant on a couch next to a fireplace.  Happy hour is a great time to visit, and the cheese and meat tray is a delicious option if you're just heading in to have a few glasses of wine and relax.  

We didn't order any entrees, but I will say that as the servers walked by with food ordered by other patrons, I was jealous in a big way lol.  I will definitely eat there in the very near future.  We were already making plans to come back before we were out the door.  Our Server, Josh, was personable, professional, knowledgeable, and attentive, and he went the extra mile to make sure our visit was memorable.  My girlfriend, who is allergic to gluten, had concerns about the cheese and meat tray.  Josh understood this issue well, and made sure that bread products were separated from the rest of the food....and we had zero issues!  

To sum up...give this place a shot.  It's a glimpse of where the restaurant industry in the Pittsburgh Area needs to be heading in the next few years."}
{"text":"My first time at Eighth and Hays and definitely not my last! I'm sorry I haven't been by sooner. The decor is gorgeous and very welcoming. We started with some signature cocktails and I highly recommend the Mediterranean Mules. They are so perfect I couldn't try the other cocktails. But stole several sips from friend's drinks lol all the mules were great! We had several starters and my favorite was probably the Crab and Corn Fritters. The Ahi Tuna was seared to perfection  The Meat and Cheese was ridiculous in the best way possible! Everything you can imagine was on this platter and nothing was missed lol We left almost nothing behind! After the starters were cleared we had time to relax with cocktails and we never rushed along. We ordered pizzas for our entrees and I loved the chicken pesto spinach pie and tried a bite of the lobster pizza. The lobster pizza sauce was amazing! Easily recommend both to try. The chef really out did himself and it was a great time!"}
{"text":"This family owned restaurant does not disappoint! The music, food, and drinks were amazing. Our waiter Josh was very attentive and the atmosphere was clean and energetic!"}
{"text":"First time here. Went for late night dinner. Not sure if it gets busy. Ordered a blood orange mule that was yummy. Friendly staff. Ordered Pot Roast Pizza, who would think, was very delicious and out of this world. Atmosphere vey cozy. Parking a little tight in the back, there is on street parking."}
{"text":"We found this place while searching for a good spot for a Wednesday night date night; little did we know that this was a hidden gem in Homestead. Wednesday night specials of a bottle of wine and a gourmet pizza for $30 was incredible. The ambiance in Eighth & Hays puts you right in a swanky joint in NYC, but minus any pretentiousness. Every details of the restaurant seems thoughtful and well planned out. Great for a date night and/or for groups!"}
{"text":"Fun place for drinks and bites. Staff and service is wonderful. Nothing too high priced but easy to rack up a tab. Chef special app was crispy pork rinds. Italian flag pizza and beef tip panini for mains. Dessert was the s'more milkshake. I found all of the food to just be \"good.\" I really think the best thing the place has going is their atmosphere, staff, and sauces. Next time I'm going to try a salad - feel like that might be their best plates."}
{"text":"We've been to Eighth & Hays three times.  Last week, we went for dinner and we were not disappointed.  My husband had a crab-stuffed halibut and I had the chicken Milanese. Both were expertly prepared and amazingly delicious.  We also shared the tuna tartare which was simply amazing.  Keep in mind that the menu changes weekly, so what we ordered may or may not be available when you visit.  I am so impressed."}
{"text":"This place is so unique and consistent.  Every time we visit we have great service, excellent food and an amazing night.   We love the charcuterie board and the atmosphere!  Highly recommend for something different and a fun night out!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and both times it was 5 stars all around. The interior is gorgeous, and the staff was accommodating. The food is to die for and portions are large. I LOVED the flame marshmallow dessert special, as well as the Charcuterie plate. The variety of meats and cheeses and size of the platter was excellent. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Our first trip to Eighth & Hays in Homestead lived up to everything we had heard. The atmosphere was the perfect combination of class and comfort. Incredible selection of wines that you won't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh (or at least I didn't notice them). Nice selection of specialty drinks and a great selection of food. 

The wait staff was warm and personable, our bartenders (Erik and Chris) were dressed to play the part. We watched them craft specialty drinks, taking their time, nothing rushed...Everyone was enjoying the ambiance - drinking, talking, and enjoying artisan foods. 

They were relaxing on comfy couches and chairs in front of the two stone fire places that act as an entry way into the bar area. Larger wooden tables were available for bigger parties reminded me of a ski lodge. Christmas music played softly in the background. 

Our meals: We started with the artisan meat and cheese tray. Somewhat pricey at $34, but this entire platter could be a meal in of itself (see pictures for what it looked like). My wife had the crab stuffed portobello and a house salad with their house ranch. I had the Pear and Blu wood fired pizza (yes they have a wood fired oven). The food was as fantastic as the atmosphere. Barely any leftovers. Their special dinners change weekly. This week it was wood fire garlic honey rosemary chicken over mashed potatoes and asparagus. I was tempted to get it, but then I saw a pizza go rolling by, so I had to switch... I was not disappointed. 

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is exactly my kind of place! Wine and brick oven pizza are two of my favorite things so when I saw the menu, I knew I had to make a visit. 

I love that Homestead is getting rejuvenated with some really cool restaurants, Eighth & Hays being one of them. While we were here, my husband and I each ordered a glass of wine and a pizza. He got a pepperoni and I got the Mediterranean. My Mediterranean pizza was outstanding; it was both beautiful and delicious. I also like that the space, although a little small, had an array of seating types. There was a bar, a few lounge areas, and dining tables.

I really enjoyed my experience here and look forward to stopping in again. This is a great place to go before or after a movie at the Waterfront!"}
{"text":"This was not just eating out with friends, this was an experience. A grown and sexy atmosphere with attentive staff. I enjoyed the intimate setting and taking pictures by the fireplace drink in hand. Excellent wine selection and a gifted Chef. I highly recommend the meat and cheese tray (who would of thought) something that sounds so simple was so complex and exciting for your tastebuds. Orgasmic deserts. I am excited to go back to try next week's entr√©es they took Pizza to a whole new level, and turned my bitter cold evening into a heart warming experience. 5 stars because they don't have 10!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great service and food.  Nice to see the avenue is getting life again."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite Happy Hour spots!  They have great deals on bottles of their premium wine and unique pizza flavors. All of the wine and sangria was great and had a refreshing flavor. The food was also very delicious. The Peach & Piggy Pizza (peach and BBQ pulled pork) was my favorite of the night, but the Lasagna Pizza, Mediterranean Pizza, and mac and cheese were also very good. Each pizza we ordered had a consistently great crisp thin crust, filled with ingredients, and always fresh out of the oven.

Came here with a large group of friends (15-20 people) and they accommodated us with no problem when we called to make a reservation and changed our group size a few times. Service was excellent in making sure we all had everything we needed, coming around multiple times throughout the night pouring us wine from the bottles we ordered and letting us know when the happy hour deals were coming to a close so we could get our orders in on time. Atmosphere of this restaurant is very relaxing and modern. There are fireplaces and couches to lounge on, as well as large wooden tables to sit at and enjoy your meals. Overall, an excellent restaurant and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent pizza and good selection of wine and cocktails. An excellent addition to the Homestead strip. Come here instead of any of the chains in waterfront!"}
{"text":"I had a surprise birthday party for my boyfriend there this past weekend. Pamela helped set everything up, and Josh was our awesome waiter that helped take care of us. 
Everything was perfect, the place was very accommodating, the food was so delicious, the drinks were tasty, and we all had a blast!
Definitely want to come back to this place again!"}
{"text":"Im not big on doing reviews but i must say 8th and Hays is a cool concept, good pizza, great paninis, one of the best meat and cheese plates you will find and the roasted grapes were great.  They may make my favorite drink in the city a Tiramisu Martini
Definitely worth a visit"}
{"text":"Very cute atmosphere. The food was nothing to ride home about but the drinks and apps were good. I would recommend for a happy hour spot or just to grab drinks."}
{"text":"I've been to this establishment several times and have never left less than impressed. They have an excellent selection of wine whether you prefer red or white and the menu is phenomenal. Highly recommend the kielbasa with bacon jam appetizer as well as any of the meat or cheese boards. If you are in the market for pizza, the pot roast are mediterranean are so delicious and flavorful. This is an great spot for special occasions or a date night. Service and management are fantastic!"}
{"text":"GREAT Cuban! Even better atmosphere & drinks! Their bacon jam on the Quattro platter was AMAZING & full of flavor."}
{"text":"I love Homestead. Like, really, really love it. This was the perfect addition to add yet another flavor to what's happening on 8th Ave.

Watching the the renovation from the covered porch at Duke's over the past few years, I had been eagerly awaiting what was to come. Rumors of wood fired pizza and wine got me wanting to gossip like a sophomore in high school. When do rumors legitimately come true? At Eighth & Hayes. 

The atmosphere is cool and sleek, but also warm and inviting with the wood and industrial decor mix. We stopped in on a Wednesday for their wine and pizza special. What a score! Your choice of a wood fired pizza and a bottle of wine for $30. The wine selection is really nice, too! We selected a nice dry rose and a simple margherita pizza. To. Die. For. Light crust, just the right amount of cheese, bright crushed tomatoes. Three of us so we ordered another with chicken, roasted red peppers and basil. Delish!

Our service was excellent and the place just exhibits a welcoming vibe. So many other step-above options for food...crab dip, charred cauliflower, Po'Boy. Speciality cocktails and wine for days. 

While I want to try the other things on the menu, it's gonna be a hard push to get me from pizza and wine. But.....I may just have to twist my own arm for a Chef's Board and Luv Jug."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the greatest wine selections in Pittsburgh. Unbelievable that you can get a glass of some incredible high-end wines from all over the world that would normally cost you $$$ by the bottle! Not into wine? The creative yet unpretentious cocktail menu is equally stellar and changes with the season. Need something to pair that tasty beverage with? The cheese and charcuterie board is incredible and great for sharing with a few friends. The salads are fresh and generous and the wood fired pizzas are uniformly excellent (though I am partial to the Mediterrenean and the good ol' Margarita). Best part is the staff who are always so welcoming and genuinely hospitable and eager to guide you through the menus. This is the kind of go-to spot perfect for a weeknight happy hour, special occasion dinner and everything in between."}
{"text":"Everything was great. The app of crab and corn fritters to the Cuban sandwich. Also we went on Wednesday and they had special a bottle of wine and pizza for $30.00. Pizza was very good. Only thing I would add is fresh basil. Dessert was best a s'mores milkshakes. This was the best. Only problem is the now won't allow children"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Wednesday dinner.  The service Eric provided at the bar was impeccable.  Personality and excellent service is always a rare pleasure.   We were able to meet Kevin the head chef who was so fun, although he wont share his recipe for bacon jam, again personable and professional.  Our appetizer sampler was amazing, pizza equally great, wine outstanding and the most gracious staff.    We will be back. So glad we found this great little niche"}
{"text":"Although the Bourbon is more than enough reason to get me here...... The wife and I come every week and I must say the staff and food are always exceptional. Every detail from the decor, cleanliness and service makes this a great date night spot. I must say this place is highly recommended."}
{"text":"What a great find! It was crowded outside, so we thought we'd have a problem getting a table, but we didn't. It was, I have to say, a little loud. Maybe I'm just old, but we had a hard time hearing across the table at times.
The cocktails were terrific. The wine list looked great as well. Only one of us had wine; the others cocktails. I'll be adventurous and try everything at some point. The wine is interesting in that you can get a one ounce pour if you want to try something new.
The food was terrific. The portions were pretty good too. We had the quarto (excellent). We had the skewers of mozzarella and tomato (of all the dishes, I thought this one was a very tiny portion). The risotto of the day was lobster and it was fabulous. We also got an apple/walnut salad-big enough to share amongst the four of us and very tasty. We also got a Mediterranean pizza. It was really good too!! We all shared everything and were full and very happy with our drinks, menu choices and venue! We will definitely go back! I suggest you go too. We can meet there!!"}
{"text":"For the location- the area has nothing like it- it's five stars! If you put it in cranberry it would probably be 3.5.   The place doesn't have a big selection, but that aside, it's great. It's got a beautiful cozy interior, polite, knowledgable staff, and thought the list is small, quality wine and excellent unadulterated food. Somehow it's even abducted my  inner introvert- I don't mind stopping here by myself on my way home an having a glass of wine and a snack.  Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"We had an enjoyable experience here last week--the ambience is nice and cozy on a cold winter evening. They have a couple of gas fireplaces, couches, and a nice intimate seating arrangement. The wine was good, and the service was excellent. That said, the food was only decent in my opinion -- tried a couple of the pizzas (mushroom, pork) and a couple of appetizers (kielbasa, veggies), and none of them were outstanding. They were perfectly fine, but just nothing that exciting. Overall I would avoid the roasted veggies, and steer towards the kielbasa."}
{"text":"Stopped to see what it was all about here. Downside was it didn't open until 4, so we had to kill time at another bar. However, we found street parking right it front and they also have a small parking lot in the back. 

We came for happy hour and it was $6 select wines, and I believe $8 Moscow mules, and $20 house wine botfles. We took a seat near the fireplace and instantly became cozy. The look inside is mostly modern with a hint of rustic. The only thing missing was snow on the ground. I counted seats inside to approximate 50 guests at the tables, plus about 7-10 that can be seated on the couch areas next to the two fireplaces, not to mention the bar area, which can seat around 10. We shared a Mediterranean pizza, which was so tasty. It was wood-fired and toppings were generous but not sloppy. I personally thought the crust would have been a tad crispier, but that's just my personal preference- it wasn't undercooked by any means. 

Our waiter was extremely nice and although there were some errors with pricing at the end, he was quick to rectify all mistakes. I cannot stress how much I enjoyed the atmosphere here. The location isn't the best, but it would be a great place to grab a drink before a movie or to meet a friend after work. I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"I was incredibly excited when a wine/ brick oven pizza bar opened in Homestead, because I live close by and am getting sick of going to the waterfront when I don't feel like driving far for a good meal/drink. When the boyfriend and I wanted to go somewhere on Friday for dinner and I was able to leave work early, my first thought was \"Eighth and Hays happy hour!\" We arrived a little after 5pm- the happy hour specials were all drink related. I took advantage of the $2 off cocktails special and enjoyed a margarita. It was really tasty- not too strong, salt & some spice along the rim and topped off with a pickled jalapeno and fresh lime. For our meals, I ordered the peach & prosciutto pizza and Brendan ordered the cuban sandwich with fries. I was blown away by the pizza- I am telling you, it was unbelievably delicious. The flavors worked SO well together- salty feta cheese, bitter arugula, sweet peaches, crunchy prosciutto.. it all just worked. The pizza crust was so flavorful and just delicious. I loved every bite and had to force myself not to overindulge and eat the entire pizza right then and there. Brendan liked his cuban sandwich a lot but probably wouldn't order it again because he found it was a little dry. The ambiance was just so perfect- relaxing and rustic. Fireplaces, couches, wooden tables, industrial chandeliers- I just loved it. The service was excellent as well. I seriously cannot wait to return! P.S. icing on the cake: parking was a breeze as well! you can park in the lot behind Eighth & Hays, or on the street out front."}
{"text":"Been meaning to leave a review, even though we've been telling anyone that would listen about this gem. My wife and I tried them out when they first opened at the end of '16 and we were blown away. We were already huge fans of Duke's so we weren't entirely surprised. We saw that they were having a first anniversary wine tasting party and we thought it'd be a nice date night since we don't get out as often as we'd like. Wow. What a night. At first we thought we might be a little out of place because most of the guests were extreme regulars and/or family, but it turned out to be one of the best nights out we've had in a really long time. The atmosphere and staff were beyond remarkable. The wines were thoughtfully chosen. But the real star for me was the food coming out of that kitchen. The braised veal cheeks were easily one of the top 3 dishes I've had anywhere. Ever.  There aren't enough words to describe some of the things we had the opportunity to eat. The fact that this type of quality food, service and atmosphere are available on 8th Ave. is unbelievable. 
My hope is that enough people appreciate this type of quality for what it is. I've read reviews on here and see people negatively commenting on prices. Obviously these people haven't stepped foot in a grocery store lately. I genuinely feel like they are very appropriately priced for what they are. We will certainly return and we wish you nothing but success."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for new places to check out, and Eighth & Hays did not disappoint!  My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves with the Wednesday wine and pizza special.  From the atmosphere, to the top notch food,  we were quite delighted...and quite full!!  We ordered so much food and shared so we could try everything...and there wasn't a thing we didn't like.  That said, the crab dip and earthquake dessert are a \"must try\".  Let's just say I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is seriously becoming one of favorite go-to places, it's always good.  My husband had the Halibut with peppers, tomatoes, and olives and I had the Braised Short Rib Lasagna. Wow, every single bite was delicious.  Service is outstanding and knowledgeable.  We sit at the bar on purpose just to watch the chef in action.  He's great."}
{"text":"Far Exceeding My Expectations.. I Wish I Could Identify All Of The Cured Meats However It Wouldn't Much Matter If Hannibal Lecter Prepared It!! If Heaven Were Food It Was Served In These Take Out Containers. Perfect For Our Netflix And Nibble. I Haven't Been This Impressed With A Meal In Years!!"}
{"text":"Love this place except for one thing...the pizza.   Which is weird because it is supposedly known for the pizza.  Oh well, the rest of it was great, so I'll just order around that weird pizza issue.    

For starters, the service was great and everyone was super-friendly.   The decor is pretty - with comfy bar chairs and a nice plush seating area near the fireplace.  They do have a collection of tables with those dreaded backless stools but they have tables with regular chairs too and didn't seem to mind accommodating my request for those.   The happy hour specials helped a lot with the price point, which is a bit high for the area, but sort of suited to the feel of the place.    

Their appetizer game is on point.  All the apps we had were delicious and I can't wait to try their charcuterie platter.   They also thought about the sharing aspect, which was nice.  For example, the kielbasa came out sliced - not the whole awkward log I envisioned. 

That pizza though - we ordered 3 different pies for the table and all of them were disappointing.   The dough was weird.  The toppings lacked balance.  Just an \"off\" flavor to all of them.  Having sampled three, I think I'll just order around those from now on.  

All in all, I liked the place.  I'd totally go back for wine and apps, but skip the pizza."}
{"text":"Overpriced and not a well marked menu. Two cocktails, two dinners and a shared dessert shouldn't be $78. The food was edible, but nothing we couldn't have done at home. There was nothing brilliantly standing out to warrant the brilliant charge on a rated $$ restaurant. I came here because the rating was high. But please, a small filet mignon with asparagus and 1/2 cup of risotto was $30. Nothing more. No salad, no fresh bread. It was plated pretty. I couldn't sleep all night because the price was so outrageous. Yes, it was my fault for not asking. I'll never make that mistake again cause I will never go back to a restaurant that gouges their customers."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this place a zero. Absolutely terrible. I have never been treated so rudely by restaurant staff AND management. We waited over 15 minutes to even be approached for drinks, then when we finally got a server, they had no glasses clean and it took another 20 minutes to even receive them. We ordered all of our food as soon as we were even approached, an hour plus later, with no food, the server finally came over and said, \"were just busy, and have big parties\". When we expressed we just wanted to cancel our order, the server stormed off without explanation. The manager then came over and gave us the same speech. That's fine, you can be busy, but you don't insult your customers. We just wanted to pay for what we had consumed, drinks only. She then told us we can just leave and they're not a fast food restaurant. I get that, but it's inexcusable to wait almost 1 and a half hours for a cheese board and a flatbread. Been a fan of dukes next door for years, which is under the same management, and was excited for this place. I will never be back! I also have over 12 years of experience in the service industry, and I cannot even comprehend treating my customers the way we were treated tonight!"}
{"text":"Drop the kids at kennywood or Battlegrounds and go enjoy yourself.  Food is incredible, wine is even better than the food; just a great place to go.  I can't recommend this place enough.  The staff is super friendly.  Homestead is next, and this place is a big reason why."}
{"text":"I hesitated writing a review because I didn't want to give away the best-kept secret in Homestead. The food, the drinks, the atmosphere...all top-notch. The crab and corn fritter appetizer exceeded my expectations, and I had heard that their pizzas were great - also correct. The lobster pizza was perfect, even though we got it without bacon because neither of us eats bacon. The strawberries and cream waffle for dessert - wow. The cream itself was divine. We WILL be back - and often!"}
{"text":"Great spot in Homestead.  They have an excellent selection of craft cocktails with a full service bar backed by knowledgeable bartenders.  The charcuterie board is excellent along with the wood fired pizzas.  I would recommend this as a good spot for a night out with friends, there are large communal tables and the prices are reasonable for the quality of food and drink."}
{"text":"This place was good. The space itself was fantastic- a comfortable mix of industrial and modern.  I felt like I could stay there all night. There are couches, rustic high tables and bar seating.  I say at the bar and it felt chic and comfortable.
The wine and drink menu is varied and a truly solid selection of cocktails and wine. I enjoyed the couple ounces of wine that I tried. I really liked that you could buy certain wines by the ounce. Both were very good.
My friend and I split the meatball and the corn & crab fritters.  The meatballs were large. Our order came out on the cold side and they were dry. Both of us kept going for the sauce dish to try to add flavor and moisture. There wasn't much sauce and I feel like I shouldn't have to work that hard.  Neither one of us would recommend them.  We both are fans of the fritters. Everything about them is comfort- creamy crab, sweet corn, fried coating, and very delicious, creamy dipping sauce.  The presentation was very nice ad well.
We decided to indulge in the milkshake for dessert. 
We got the salted caramel torte milkshake.  The milkshake itself was very good. They pike it high with whipped cream and coat the mug with Carmel and crunches. 
In hindsight, we should have gotten pizza. I'll probably go back again. I love the space and I want to try the pizza."}
{"text":"Love this place! Angie is amazing and the atmosphere is very welcoming and cozy. The chef has a real talent.  The menu has featured items weekly. Please stop in for a pleasant experience you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying the new Eighth & Hays in Homestead. 

Party of four found some comfortable seating and were immediately greeted. Recommendations were given for starters and we decided on the Mule as well as the charcuterie board. I'm a pretty big Mule fan and am often critical on the quality, but Eighth and Hays nailed it with the vodka to ginger beer ration and the lime. Extremely good and even better considering the reasonable price. The charcuterie board was expansive with a variety of hams, sausages and cheeses, accompanied by 3 different spreads along with Pitas and toast. Top notch board, and while the price was a bit higher than expected, I cannot really complain considering the quality of what we were delivered.

We weren't completely starving so we settled on a Pizza which was cooked in a wood fired oven. We went with the cheese pizza - a rule of thumb I follow is that if a pizza place cant perfect a basic cheese pizza, they aren't going to impress me with any specialty pies. Wood Fired oven Pizza spots are popping up all over Pittsburgh tsburgh, and as I try them I think its a key that  that the pizza is crispy, with melted cheese, but not burnt. The Pizza here delivered on that. One of the Pizzas fed my fianc√© and I comfortably. Again for the quality and the price I had zero complaints.

I WILL be returning to Eighth and Hays, this time with a more empty belly and advantageous pallet. Assuming my next experience is as good as my first one, I foresee this being one of my new go-to spots in the area."}
{"text":"I'm ALWAYS craving wine over the weekend anywhere I am so we were trying to find a wine bar around the house. Unfortunately, our options were limited so we decided on Eighth & Hays for convenience. Before going, my boyfie warned me that this area is not the best area to hang out. When we walked in, my boyfie was surprised how different this place was from what he's used to on this street/area.

I ordered a rose and he ordered the brut. Both were good and we were happy with our selections. We wanted to order the ahi tuna to munch on but they had run out for the night (it was about 10pm). We settled on the cheese board which had the most unique cheeses I've ever tried. The smoked cheese was amazing and the spreads it came with complemented each cheese very well. I highly recommend this plate to anyone.

I loved the ambiance of this place. The couches were incredibly comfortable and the dim lights made this perfect for a date night.

-1 star because for a wine bar I was expecting a long list of wine. Nope, not here."}
{"text":"I came her with my best friends from college after one of their bridal showers. The decor was hipster and they have a game room that I thought was cool. 

The food was great! I had the shrimp bruscetta for my appetizer. No complaints here! The flavor profile was so complimentary with the blush red sauce and the shrimp. I don't personally care for hard bruscetta so I was happy the the sauce soaked into the bread. 

I ordered the margarita pizza. It was simple but they had rosemary somewhere in there and that took it up a notch. I love rosemary, so I was happy to have it. The mozzarella was fresh and the dough was both crispy and soft. 

For dessert,  my friends and I shared a Smores milkshake. The chef came out and torched our marshmallows at the table. I thought that was a nice touch. The shake itself was delicious. It was hearty so it can certainly be shared. 

I had this restaurant booked marked and I definitely understood why. I will certainly be coming back soon."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough.  Just a stone's throw away from Waterfront's horrid dining offerings,  this place was a God send. The food is fresh, the menu is plentiful.  Please bring back the crab cake.  The Mediterranean pizza is out of this world!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my first visit to Eighth & Hays! We sat at the bar and Josh was an excellent bartender/server. The Grapefruit Mule was a refreshing end of summer drink with hand squeezed lemon. Smoke & Water was surprisingly delicious for a dirty martini. 

We started with the Corn & Crab Fritter which came out piping hot, crispy and delicious! The Wednesday special was a bottle of house wine and any pizza for $30. We decided on the Steak & Shroom pizza with a bottle of Pinot Noir. Perfect pairing! The wood oven pizza had a generous layer of cheese with a perfectly toasted crust.

I'll be back to visit here again!"}
{"text":"We came here at the last minute for dinner. First off, the atmosphere is great. There is nowhere else in Homestead that I have been that has such a high end vibe.  It is lively and hip without being pretentious.

We asked for advice on the wine and we had initially missed the price differential in the house wines versus the others. Fortunately, our server was good and we were able to switch to the house wines, which were good 6 oz pours for $8. We tried the Malbec, Cabernet and Rose, all were good in our opinion.

The food was of pretty good quality. We had two special appetizers that were really good. It was a blackened cauliflower and baked oysters. We then had the antipasti, which had great presentation and tasted pretty good. Everything was tasty and of decent quality but there were few standout items.

The bill was high but reasonable given the amount of wine and food consumed. Definitely plan on returning and excites to support this new Homestead restaurant."}
{"text":"First time here and can't believe it used to be Eat N Park!  Drinks were awesome but the antipasto was UNREAL!  We didn't think we could eat it but it was so good we crushed it!  Very nice place, relaxing and trendy.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Homestead needs more like this!!

Great spot down here, I can't believe I've been so busy the past six months I literally didn't even remember it existed!"}
{"text":"This was an exceptional experience overall! To start Jamie and Pam were amazing with awesome cocktails, service and personality! The food was amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed every morsel! The decor is industrial but warm and cozy. We can't wait to go back. Had the crab dip, stuffed banana peppers and 2 side salads. We were impressed with the food, service, and overall ambiance!"}
{"text":"What am I more happy about:  Homestead having a wine bar OR their meat and cheese board?  I can't decide!

My dad, hubs, and I wanted to try something new.  E&H  opened a few weeks ago and I heard good things about their charcuterie boards.  We opted for the meat and cheese board which had various cheeses, elk sausage, bacon jam, and - wait for it - pickled grapes!!!  I know... I thought the same thing... who pickles grapes?  Well, Eighth and Hayes of course!  Sweet and tart grapes that brought the whole plate together.  We couldn't get enough.

I wanted something green and decided to order a beet and goat cheese salad.  This was a large salad so be prepared.   It's not just a small side salad, it's an entr√©e sized salad.  The goat cheese was very soft and it became a bit mushy in the salad.  Still delicious, though.

We ordered pizzas as our main dish.  We were told they was individual sized, they were not.  If that's all you're eating, perhaps.  These are a good sharing size.  Thinking individually, we ordered 3: the pear and bleu, the pot roast pizza, and the swine.

I chose the pear and blue. Unfortunately I felt this was a bit too bleu cheese forward.  The pizza had bacon on it as well.  I felt the pear was overwhelmed by the other flavors.  I actually put some of the salad on top of this pizza to cut the pungent cheese flavor.

The Swine pizza was a bit underwhelming. Yes it's bacon, but it's not different or special... it's just bacon and pulled pork on pizza.

The pot roast pizza was by far and away the best, most flavorful pizza.  You got the flavor of the pot roast with the simplicity of a pizza.  This is a must try.

My husband and I will definitely return for another meat and cheese board.  Is there a way I can order more pickled grapes?  Welcome to the neighborhood, Eighth and Hayes!"}
{"text":"I've become a big fan of Eighth & Hays in Homestead. If you're going to the movies or a date night in the Waterfront, scrap the typical chain scene of the area and go here (it's only right across the tracks).  Besides the cool atmosphere, delicious food and great drinks, it's a family-owned and operated business, so I'd much rather give them my business. 

The atmosphere and staff: The vibe and and layout of the space is great, and you feel like you're welcome (as it's not stuffy or pretentious).  I've also found the staff very knowledgeable and eager to give their recommendations on their food and beverages. 

The cocktails and wines: They have about a dozen craft cocktails (I've tried a few, and they've all be tasty), and my girlfriend enjoyed the variety of wine options. You won't be walking in and noticing a tap list of 30 craft beers (but hey, it's a wine and craft cocktail bar).  If you're in the mood for a few craft cocktails, slide next door at Duke's (same ownership). 

The food: Everything I've had at Eighth & Hays has been well prepared, fresh and super tasty. Our party ordered the meat and cheese board, and it great... and large. I've tried two of their pizzas the few times, the fungi (mushrooms) and pear and bleu cheese, and they were both amazing!"}
{"text":"I was here last night, and can't even begin to explain how much I enjoyed myself. As I frequently do, I dined by myself at the bar. I was pleasantly surprised to find there were not only purse hooks under the counter, but that there were outlets to plug in your devices. These seemed to be in abundance throughout the restaurant/bar, and it's greatly appreciated in this day and age (I feel old saying that but it's true)!

I brought a book to read, and ordered a bottle of Moscato (which was actually decently priced at $31 and wasn't a cheap brand either). I had a summer salad with berries, feta, and vinaigrette (no onions at my request), and a turkey club. However, I understand that they change their menu frequently; and in fact starting this upcoming Wednesday an entire new food and drink menu.

As I live right across the river, I plan to return whenever possible; and certainly Wednesday-Friday for their 5-7 happy hour with $20 bottles of house wine!"}
{"text":"I've been to Eighth and Hays several times and I just can't say enough good things about it! I love it! From the atmosphere and decor to the drinks and food, I loved it all. 

The restaurant isn't huge but there is a lot of seating in the dining are, at the bar, and some more casual seating on couches near the fireplaces. I've been here at different times and the busiest so far has been Friday night. 

There is many wine and cocktail choices and there are sometimes drinks specials too. The staff has always been polite and helpful. The restaurant and bathroom is very new and clean. Prices are moderate I would say depending on what you get. Our party of 4 ate for $160 including drinks and not including tip. 

I've had the Mediterranean and margherita pizzas which were super flavorful and delicious. Enough to share between 2 people as the meal with an app I think. The pesto chicken pizza was disappointing though as the pesto was indistinguishable. The cheese boards are awesome and a great share for the table. If you like bacon, then the bacon jam is for you! It's basically, AMAZING! The trio app was disappointing as well because the hummus was flavorless so I would not get this. Spinach artichoke dip and Brussels sprouts appetizers, both specials, were also delicious. I've also enjoyed the apple walnut salad and would get it again! My husband has also enjoyed a steak special and even a half pound burger! 

For dessert, if you like ice cream and milkshakes, you MUST try their \"Love Jugs.\" Enough to share. Our server offered to spike it with a shot of vodka too. 

My only real complaint is that they sometimes don't time the food well. I was finished with salad (my meal), before my husband even had his burger. Even with that, I wasn't upset because everything else is so good! 

I'll most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Went here with a big group (16 people). First, I'd like to say there is a parking lot behind the building that most people didn't know about. Our meals were super scattered coming out. I was done eating my entire pizza before the last pizza came out. (10-15 min difference). I would not recommend going with a big group. Pizza's were a good size. Can easily eat by yourself if you have a good appetite. Crust is nice and fluffy. Unique toppings. I got the bleu cheese and pear one. It was good but probably wouldn't get again. I like more sauce/cheesy. I was dipping my crust in the drizzled blue cheese on top. They have a few daily specials that people got-lobster Mac and cheese and Brussels sprouts, beef brisket and raviolis. Smaller portions but everyone seemed to like them. I think splitting a pizza and getting an appetizer/special would have been a good idea. Of course someone had to get a milkshake. They said it was as good as it looked. I wouldn't mind going here again but probably wouldn't pick it myself."}
{"text":"This is a newer restaurant in homestead (to me) since I relocated from Pittsburgh. What drew me is the wine and pizza! 

It is located on the street after the bridge to the waterfront shops. The parking lot is small because it is shared with another business next store. Inside it reminds me of a lounge. There is a full bar in the back with couch lounge seating in the middle. The tables are on the perimeter. They have long high top tables as well as traditional seating. 

They have a variety of wines and alcohol. I got the spicy margarita as a beverage. It was very good and strong. 

We came with a large group of girls and we all ordered a little something from the menu. 

I loved the crab dip appetizer. 

We all ordered pizza. I got the Mediterranean which was delicious. The balsamic really brought out the flavor. 

The pear pizza- it was overpowering with the blue cheese and my friend had a hard time finishing it.

The margarita was very flavorful as well. 

Now for dessert. So imagine a group of women, and we see the executive chef come out with a ice cream dessert. He places it on the table, while lighting the marshmallow for the s'mores effect!  It helped that the chef was good looking, as my friends ordered several desserts to have him come out and serve it lol 

The s'mores dessert was delicious on top of the presentation. It was an explosion of flavors and it is easily shareable. 

I will be returning to 8th and Hays!"}
{"text":"I saw a couple of reviews on this restaurant and had to go check it out because it's in my back yard. From the moment we walked in until the moment we walked out it was perfection. We were seated immediately and started checking out the menu. We noticed that you could gets 1oz and 3oz pours of wine. Our server, Marissa, talked with us about all of the different wines. We made our own wine flight of four 3oz pours. We tried a Chardonnay, a Reisling, a blush, and a Red. The manager actually chose the red we tried. About that time they turned the fireplace on. Wine and a fireplace = cozy. We decided what we were going to eat while sipping the wines. We ordered two appetizers and an entree. The first entree was Ahi Tuna with sticky rice. It was served on a wooden board-Tuna down one side and sticky rice down the other. The sticky rice had been toasted and was a little crispy on the outside. There was a very tasty sauce used to decorate the board but was also used to dip the rice in. Then the 2nd appetizer came out-mussels. I had only tried mussels once before and I was not a fan. They brought out a huge bowl of mussels with frites on top. The frites were crispy shoestring potatoes Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. I started eating the frites and my hubby started eating the mussels. He commented that they were the best mussels he had ever had. My curiosity won out and I had to try them. I ended up eating half of the bowl!  I guess you can teach an old dog new tricks. . For an entree we picked a Charcuterie Board. You could get it with or without roasted vegetables. We chose without because we're already getting full. Lo, and behold, they brought us out the biggest Charcuterie Board I have ever seen!  There was meats and cheeses, bacon Jam and figs, pickled grapes and grapes that tasted like cinnamon, pita points and slices of baguettes, almonds, just endless tastes, textures and flavors.  We tried them all and ate them all. What is crazy is that I wanted to try a \"jug\" for dessert but I was waaayy to full. I guess I'll just have to go back. LOL"}
{"text":"We had a very nice time this evening exploring another Homestead establishment.  Very friendly service and a great place for what I refer to as \"Nibley's!\"  They has a nice variety of signature cocktails  , as well as, a nice wine  list?. The Tres Chile Margarita had a nice jalape√±o kick, but not overwhelming.  The tiramisu cream was a different twist than a Kahlua & Cream - very smooth and yet not too sweet.  See my tip regarding Wednesday nights .  The Tacco Primitivo was a slight bit peppery and robust with flavor .  We enjoyed a Winter Hays Salad that was super fresh and perfectly tossed in the champagne dressing- definitely large enough to share.  I'd also recommend the Pear  and Bleu Pizza - delicious and a perfect accompaniment to the wine/libations. We plan to try the sister Restaurant next door called Duke .....  total bill $49.22.  Not a bad deal ?"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised by this little wood fired pizza and wine joint. A tremendously good development for Homestead and signs of things to come for the neighborhood. We had a charcuterie plate and the pear and blue cheese pizza split for four people and it was plenty. The meats and cheeses were very nice and the pizza was good as well. The wine selection was good by the glass but the three reds i chose were good but not phenomenal. The value was the house wines which were $8/ glass. The specialty cocktails were also interesting and the other couple we were with seemed to enjoy them. We sat in front of the cozy fireplace on a cold night and really enjoyed it. I will definitely be back particularly if i happen to be in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I had an awesome experience! This was my first time and we went for happy hour. Bottles of wine for $20 is acceptable as that averages $5 per glass. We had multiple pizzas and all were good. The feta pizza was my least favorite as the feta was all I could taste instead of flavor combinations like the rest of the pizzas. I highly suggest the peach and piggy pizza which had a good flavor combination of fruit and pork (paired good with wine). My favorite was the roast beef pizza. 

Outside of happy hour, the prices are on the higher end, but this is multiple levels above your average south side bar. 

I highly suggest you give this place a visit."}
{"text":"Top notch on all aspects - wine, food, service and atmosphere. Our group of six enjoyed the charcuterie board (excellent quantity & quality), pizzas and sandwiches. There wasn't one complaint among the group - fresh ingredients, great flavors and reasonable prices. You HAVE to get a love jug for dessert, but get ready to make a mess and share with everyone! Parking is never an issue. Will be back - we love it here!"}
{"text":"Ok, this place is fabulous. I had the clam chowder tonight that was like no other. Totally deconstructed and delicious. Great choices of wine reasonably priced.  Angie our server was great and so professional. We met Chef Kevin also. The pizza was delicious. The ambiance of this place belies that it is in Homestead. A definite spot for \"foodies\"
You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Definitely feeling the vibe of the restaurant. Walked in and immediately loved the layout and the diverse group of people inside.

Love the idea of going out and having a fancy charcuterie board and wine with friends.

We ordered the lasagna pizza and it was delicious. Really enjoyed biting into the pizza and tasting the elements of lasagna. We also had the grilled salad and it was simply delicious. Really enjoyed the bacon and the dressing was very tasty.

I tried one of their Moscow Mules and it was very tasty. The bartender recommended it because of the vodka being rare and I enjoyed it. 

Definitely recommend this place for girls night or moms getting some time to themselves."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with about half the tables being large hightop for larger groups or sharing.  Like the couches in front of the fireplace. To bad the fireplace was not on.  
We started with wine since that is suppose to be one of the draws of E&H. There are 10 house wines, 7 sparking wines by the glass or bottle.  Then there are the climate controlled red (8), whites (7) and bottles (6).  The 8 red and 7 white climate controled are offered in 1oz, 3oz, 6oz, or bottle.  Decided to try a couple of wines but found the prices way high, way high.  You can get a 6oz pour of the TB Primitivo for more than a bottle price at the state store (some of the others wines they have available are similar in pricing).  There is a happy hour pricing that lowers the 6oz pour but none of the others pours are lower.  We learned that on Wednesday you can get a pizza and house bottle for $30, so maybe go on a Wednesday.  While I enjoyed the wines I tried I found they tend to have wines that are more on the very fruity and plum side and with not as much balance and tannin.  One wine I had was the Mollydooker Merlot and it was enjoyable but a tad fruity to go with the pizza I had.  
The food was very good.  We started with the Beets & Bleu salad that was very good.  It has grilled golden beets with lots of greens, candied pecans and a nice viaigrette.   Our pizza choice was the Chicken Spinach Artichoke pizza that had mozzarella, pesto cream and a touch of smoked chili.  Our meal was very enjoyable.
Service was friendly but they were overwhelmed.  Not sure why they seemed to be understaffed.  The waitstaff was working hard but had to many tables to cover.  Think they only had two waitresses and the all the tables were full. The kitchen staff helped out bringing out the food.  We did ask for some different wines for our second glass and it took a really long time to get our second glass, as well as our first glass.  Also, we were asked if we would like some parmesan and pepper flakes for our pizza, which we accepted and they never came."}
{"text":"For the past week I've been raving to everyone I talk to about the wine and cheese from here! It's seriously the some of the best combination of flavors I've had in my life. The pairings of cheese and wine are nothing short of brilliant and I couldn't imagine a better place to indulge. 

When you come here, you'll notice that there is an extensive selection of both white and red reserve wines available in a range of pours. Being able to sample limited stocks of one, two, four and six ounces really gives you an appreciation of each selection. I can't forget about the imported cheese, oh the cheese is so good you won't know what to do with yourself. Get the cheese board when you hear with the fig, apple butter, spiced grapes and bacon jam! It's absolutely phenomenal.

Enough of me talking, you need to get here and see for yourself. The food is also a extra plus on this place. Nothing here was short of perfect!"}
{"text":"With Tender closing, we went in search of a new \"go to\" higher quality cocktail/eats place. This was my second time at Eighth and Hays.  It's deceptive from the outside, not much to see, but it's a really well furnished/stylish once inside. For any one of the following reasons, I would rate this place as 4 stars, but the fact that it excel at so much has been impressive.  
Service:amazing.  Everyone is personable, attentive, knowledgeable about the food and beverages.  Bartenders and chef come out to check on your happiness.
Drinks: interesting rotating seasonal cocktails, very good \"speak easy\" style staple of regular cocktails. (the Sazerac is spot on)  A very nice wine list. Also really good happy hour drink specials.
Food:  excellent! Wood fired pizza is the feature and is almost always what I will get going forward. But, a nice appetizer/tapas starter menu is available and the entrees I've had \"pork chop\" and \"Filet\" were incredible.
Dessert: Get the Love Jug and expect to have to share it.  This is an A+

Summary: For a couple during happy hour.  4-6 cocktails, 1 shared appetizer, 1 shared pizza, 1 shared Love Jug. You're out of there for under $100 with every phase of the meal being A+"}
{"text":"This place is so cute. It's a great place to go for a quick date or a group of friends. Their menu has a nice variety of shareable items and solo dishes. Came here with a group of people and someone let me try their crab dip. Sooooo good. I probably come back here just to get that for myself. I ordered  the Winter Hays salad which was good. It had a mix of greens, yellow raisins, pecans, asiago cheese, comes with bacon but i for without and pomegranate champagne vinaigrette. For my main dish I ordered the  funghi pizza which had mushroom Alfredo and mozzarella. Their mixed drinks are good too. Of course everywhere I go I have to order an old fashioned...and they know how to make it. I also had a pear martini which was pretty food too."}
{"text":"Me and my husband stopped there after a movie at the Waterfront. It is owned by the Dukes bar next door. I absolutely love the interior. An intimate place to grab a drink. We did order food. I had the smoked turkey club and my husband had the beef tip. They were not so great and extremely dry. The house chips though were yummy but could have used some seasoning. I had their version of a cosmo which was very good and my husband had the tiramisu martini but it was more coffee like and not creamy. Our server was excellent. We will def go back to try the pizza and hope that is better than the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere! Food is great from the meat and cheese plate to the specialty menu....everything is an amazing taste! Looking forward to our next visit"}
{"text":"Can't even begin to explain how much we enjoyed it. Josh was an excellent server and answered all of our questions since this was our first time there. Will definitely go back at least 
once a month and that is the truth. I had the Grapefruit Mule is was so delicious and refreshing. We started off with the Veggie & Cheese board which was out of this world - delicious. Had the wine and any pizza for $30 - delicious also.  Will definitely recommend this place to everyone. Also, had dessert Yummy !"}
{"text":"Excellent good service. Good wine. Good food. Atmosphere also excellent. Everything was wonderful  parking available. Enjoyed everything about this place. Even a small fireplace with seats surrounding it for food and drink"}
