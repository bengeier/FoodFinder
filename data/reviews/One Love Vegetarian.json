{"text":"The best vegetarian food in Toronto, have tried everything on the menu over the years and you can't go wrong with any choice. I usually have the roti (potato and chickpea or pumpkin are my favourite), the BBQ Tofu (easily the best tofu dish I've ever eaten) or the Callaloo, and always get whatever juice of the day they're doing. And you can't go wrong with the corn soup."}
{"text":"Don't come here unless you have time to watch your meal be diligently and lovingly prepared. So good. So worth it. It's a tiny space, but it's great to catch up here over fresh juice and corn soup. I can't seem to deviate from the BBQ Tofu, but I've sampled many friends dishes, and it's all great."}
{"text":"One Love Vegetarian is a Caribbean vegan restaurant that is a takeout favourite just north of Bathurst Station and Honest Ed's at the corner of Bloor and Bathurst.  Owners Ikeila Wright and Ras Iville Wright began as a soup kiosk in the Harbourfront Centre's World Cafe food court, at first serving their corn soup which is so amazing it has gotten its own feature on the Food Network. They eventually expanded to their current-- permanent--location in the Annex in 2009.  The Good: The menu features vegan-friendly roti, with your choice of 3 different types of filling--seasoned jamaican pumpkin, chickpea & potato, and textured vegetable protein-- and 3 different shells: white/whole wheat/dahl puri, for about $8 each. Their signature corn soup sells in two different sizes for $3 and $5. Three different vegan entrees include a BBQ tofu bowl, curried bean curd & lima beans, and Callaloo (Jamaican greens), which all come with seasoned brown basmati rice, ripe avocado sliced and fried plantains. A large selection of fresh fruit juice and smoothies, as well as vegan cookies round off a solid, home-style menu. The prices are definitely reasonable for the quality and large portion sizes.  We both ordered small corn soups and the BBQ Tofu Stir-Fry as our main entrees and were beyond happy!  The Bad: It's a cash-only, take-out establishment with only a few seats--but they serve you at your table which is sweet--and they almost forgot to give us hot sauce ;)  Overall: One Love Vegetarian is definitely a one of a kind amazing Caribbean food; you almost forget that it's a vegan restaurant as well. The flavours are delicious and intense but not overbearing, and it's a unique cuisine that is almost unlike anything you have ever had before. The staff are very friendly and the environment is very warm and inviting, though small. It is what Toronto has been missing in terms of Caribbean food!"}
{"text":"I eat here regularly, food is consistently great. The staff are really nice! Only negative is that they usually run out of stuff by the evening, get there early so not to miss out!!"}
{"text":"I personally think you can find better roti in the city. The last time I was there I got the Jamaican pumpkin roti. I felt as though they didn't put enough filling in it and was all roti. The BBQ tofu dish is pretty good. I'm not sure where else you can get bbq tofu like that in the city hence why I am giving them a 3 stars.  If it wasn't for the BBQ tofu I think I'd give it a 2.5 it's not really because of the food but sometimes when I go in the i find the costumer service a bit poor. I also sat down and ate there rather then take it to go asked if I could have a cup of water and they told me they can't give out cups. . I also really didn't like that.  Would I go back there again, maybe it's defiantly not the first thing on my list..."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favourite roti place in the city! I've taken non-vegan friends and they have also grown addicted. I was going to start listing my favourite foods but then realized I had started to type out the whole menu.   Depending on how hungry you are a perfect meal would start with cup of corn soup, followed by a roti (mix up the fillings! Pumpkin goes great with EVERYTHING!), if you're feeling indulgent a side order of plantain will round out your meal. After a workout, if I wanted extra protein, I'd share a side of BBQ tofu with my friend.   If you're really lucky and find the little almond apple butter cookies in stock - get some! They are highly sought after and for good reason. They have no right to be as tasty as they are. I believe that I'm in constant competition with at least half a dozen individuals who buy out the entire stock as soon as they happen upon them. I'd like to shout \"Save some for the rest of us!!\" but unfortunately, I completely understand their cookie hoarding.   It's a cash-only, take-out establishment with only a few seats. There is no restroom available to the public. Fill your wallet and empty your bladder before you go.   Happy eating!"}
{"text":"The paratha is incredibly flaky and moist and stretchy and delicious. My favourite roti has pumpkin and chickpeas/potatoes with a little hot sauce. The BBQ tofu stir fry is delicious, as is the corn soup.  It's right across from Bathurst subway so not the most attractive view.  Also, minimal seating.  But good tunes, good vibes, and most importantly, great food."}
{"text":"I could eat here all day everyday!!!  Everything is amazing!  I get the corn soup all the time, that's a given, LOVE the BBQ tofu, and do NOT forget to try the cookies!!!!  The smores are my fav!  They never make it home!!! LOVE ONE LOVE!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin. One of a kind amazing Caribbean vegan food.  A few of my favourites are: the melt in your mouth dhal puri roti w/ Jamaican pumpkin spiced to perfection, the corn soup is fabulous.   Callaloo - Jamaican Greens served with yellow yam, boiled green bananas organic whole wheat dumplings and avocado  BBQ Tofu Stir-Fry Organic Tofu with sweet peppers, Vidalia onions and tantalizing sauce served with organic Basmati Rice and Peas, Fried plantains and avocado slices.  Bean Curd and Lima Beans Soya bean curd strips curried with Lima Beans served with organic Basmati Rice and Peas, organic garden salad, fried plantain and avocado  Always surprising us daily with a variety of incredible vegan desserts.   I'm in heaven.  The only down side is, they only have only one location."}
{"text":"Corn soup is five star fantastic, as is the service, from the pleasantly gruff older woman, to the lovely young ladies.   However, the curry is bland; the dhal puri dry as dust with zero give to the dough, and the regular roti not up to the fresh and tender standards of say, Gandhi.  I like the relaxed, cheerful vibe, which comes from the bright paint job, kind staff and usually Carribean music choices, but the food really just isn't the flavourful, aromatic fix for a spicy food inclination."}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious food.  Not delicious for vegan food, but plain delicious food.   This place is my new favourite lunch spot. The food is perfectly spiced, well cooked, served with care! Good prices too. Do it."}
{"text":"Much love for One Love! Best roti I've ever had - I recommend the Mystery Roti! Staff are super friendly, and it's in a good location. Remember to bring your cash...no plastic!"}
{"text":"fantastic. everything is great.   Last time I was there i had the bbq tofu, heaven."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Fresh, tasty, wholesome food.  Mainly a takeout counter with minimum seating. Price is a little high for the limited service but its the quality of ingredients that make it worth it."}
{"text":"One of a few I-tal/Vegan restaurants in Toronto, I find it very important to support the Rasta community. One Love is owned by a lovely Rasta couple. The husband (Ras Iville) is usually found at their corn soup shop during the whole summer at Harbourfront. His wife is usually serving at the counter along with hired staff. Ras Iville is an important elder in the house of Nyahbinghi.  I-tal food means fresh, preservative and conservative free, no salt, and usually vegan.  I love their soup-it is flavoured so nicely. Their ginger beer and sorel is delicious.  The shop itself is warmly painted and decorated. Something this city needs more.."}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious food and vegan too! Love the pumpkin roti, and the ginger beer - best ginger beer ever! The calalloo is an incredible dish with so many different kinds of vegetables and so tasty. Great vibes and great care, which finds it way into the food of course."}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! It's always awesome to find different vegetarian fare in Toronto. One Love Vegetarian serves up Caribbean veg food that fills the tummy with love.  After reading about it on BlogTO, I felt a need to try it out, since I've never had Caribbean vegetarian food before.   I was impressed for the number of selections available for an establishment this size. A good number of mains, an assorted selection of drinks and homebaked desserts on hand.  I had the vegetarian roti and my friend had the dish with callaloo and homemade soup.  The portion for the soup was decent (comes in small/large) and it was delicious. The stuffed roti was filled with potatoes, chickpeas and spices, wrapped in your choice of I believe 3 different kinds of roti, which I thought was really tasty.  I believe it's a family operation and it's a mother/daughters team who works the kitchen, cash and clean up. When crowds build up, expect a wait.   Groups of +2 be warned: There is a *very* limited number of tables, so be sure to beat the crowds or do takeout."}
{"text":"We had roti: small for $5 and a large for $8. They looked like the same size. Pumpkin roti. It was like...spicy pumpkin puree. Interesting. The curried chick pea roti was...acceptable but certainly no Mother India. Think I'll give those meals (rice based) a shot next. Seemed like a friendly establishment. Big hats on those Caribbean fellows."}
{"text":"Awesome Roti! What a little gem! Not greasy and super tasty, highly recommend getting the hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian/ vegan small restaurant. Been here a few times, usually for lunch. My go to item is the corn soup... So incredibly delicious. My mouth waters as I eat it lol. Add a little of their orange hot chilli sauce to the soup and omg... So good.It's simple but packs great flavour. I get a large corn soup and a half paratha usually ($8)  Always hits the spot.  Service great and always friendly. Love love love one love! cash only."}
{"text":"When I took my BVF (Best Vegan Friend) here a while back and she asked the obligatory question \"Are there any vegan options on the menu?\" When the lovely woman behind the counter replied with a very grand sweeping gesture that \"Everything here is vegan!\" my BVFs smile lit up the whole place.   This place inspires me.  It makes believe that I could be a vegan instead of a the aspiring wannabe poser that I currently am.   It also brings out the inventor in me; whenever Jah is smiling and they are actually open and I am lucky enough to have a bowl of corn soup I also get an EXTRA one to go.  One Love's magical elixir of Vegan Goodness can form the basis of many tasty and visually impressive dishes.  It's true - the staple of the Veggie Food Fest is the building block to culinary wonder.  The roti here are not to be missed!  Many West Indian spots have veggie options that just kind of present as afterthoughts; kind of \"oh let's stop right there before we throw in the meat\" - almost a proto-food kind of vibe.  One Love makes many and they make them all with superior flavour and texture.    Homemade ginger beer is also not to be missed!  Very worthwhile stop for anyone looking for a quick, healthy, flavourful meal.  Could not be easier to find - exit the Bathurst station and look up."}
{"text":"Whoa! So good! This was my first visit. I had the tofu dish and some callaloo and both were amazing. It was great because it also came with some avocado and brown rice. They had some hot sauce with some good kick also! I'll definitely be back when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. It has a small mom and pop laid back rasta feel to it.   dahl puri roti w/ Jamaican pumpkin - 3/5 good just missing some texture chickpea curry- 5/5 raspberry lemonade- 5/5 seeds and all pineapple coconut cupcake- 5.5 banana chocolate chip muffin 4/5  repeat definitely"}
{"text":"Soup is as good as advertised; some nice flavor that I can't pinpoint. The roti with paratha plus Jamaican and chickpea is fantastic: fluffy and flavorful. For those that like spicy food be sure to ask for extra spicy because it adds nice flavors."}
{"text":"They say hindsight is 20/20 - well, if hindsight could also taste, it'd be kicking me right now for not trying this place when I lived just around the corner from it.  But no matter! I have finally fallen into their tasty trap; their warm and delicious, comforting *tasty* trap. From the friendly warm welcome you receive when you walk in, to the final bites of your meal, I dare say you'll feel happy and right at home.  I've gorged myself in the couple of visits i've been to One Love, trying their famed corn soup (a gorgeously constructed stew bursting with flavour and veggies), a giant chick pea roti (of which I will now automatically get one to-go for lunch the next day) and the BBQ Tofu Stirfry - an amazing mix of beans/rice, fried plantain slices, ripe avocado and some of the most flavourful lightly-fried tofu strips i've ever eaten.  Service is prompt and helpful, and even when the small seating area is full you'll not have to wait too long for your food. Prices are definitely reasonable for the incredible quality and satisfying portion sizes. Let's face it - it's probably for the best I don't live right around the corner any more or i'd be looking at a long winter of building up roti-tops (forget muffin-tops, i'm taking this to the next level).  One Love, I hope you can forgive me for unknowingly snubbing you for all those months! Let's stay friends forever."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with the BBQ Tofu Stir Fry dish at One Love. It's the best thing I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"The food is addictive, that's how good it is. It's a small place, certainly not a place to dine in, but grab your food to go and enjoy it at home. They make great roti's and rice and pea dishes - having just come back from Jamaica and Saint-Lucia - it brings back great memories of local foods in the Caribbean ! And if you do become addicted here, the affordable prices makes it possible for regular visits."}
{"text":"Bring cash! One Love is cash only, but worth the effort. I can't get enough of their corn soup: it's the booth we beeline to first at every Harbourfront festival. The restaurant itself offers a great selection of curries, meals and desserts (which I haven't tried yet - though the fried plantain slices are nearly sweet enough to count.) My chic pea and brown rice curry dish was delicious, filling, and energizing. I also noticed many people getting the house made ginger drink: must remember to bring enough coinage for that next time, too! I just wish they had real plates and cutlery instead of plastic for dining in. Such a waste! The other fun thing about stepping through those steamy glass doors into the spicy warmth here is the family-style seating, which encourages interesting conversations with their eccentric clientele. Let's get together (over a rice bowl) and feel all right."}
{"text":"Shocked by the terrible service.  I visited OneLove during my timed lunch, ran in/placed an order, then informed her I had to rush to the bank and noted I would be back immediately for my food.  I returned 15 min later to find my meal hadn't been started.  Out of time - I expressed that I intended for it to be waiting for me, just as if I made a take-out order at the counter: what's the difference?  She said sometimes people don't come back from the bank...  Okay (So you don't trust me even though I expressly said I would be right back?)  I left in tears, hungry and late for class after walking over half an hour to eat at OneLove.  Before I left, the lady offered to pour me a bowl of soup, the only nice gesture - but that's not what I wanted.  Maybe if she said 'free in apology' for wasting my time...  But she didn't.  When I left I was so distraught by the whole thing I began crying, and decided to call the restaurant to see if they could agree that my awful experience deserved some form of discount on a later lunch.  She argued with me over the phone and told me ignorantly, \"The only person who can make you feel better is you\"  I told her, \"Yes, excellent point, but right now you could help turn my day back around.\"  She told me to call her and remind her of who I am when I decide to come back.  The next day I was craving the Jamaican Vegan dish I didn't get on that awful day before as described.  So I called down and let them know I was in my way, with no awful time constraints today.  I politely apologized for bothering to call, admitting they must be busy.    When I arrived and asked for my meal, she presented me with the full price, unlike I had hoped - after everything.  I asked her about the discount we discussed and she firmly told me, \"She never agreed to anything.\"  And after what felt like begging (pleading my case, again) she began arguing with me again and then offered me the meal without tax for $12.  I was suggesting $10 to be happy and forgive all of the previous visits mistakes, and shit I probably would've tipped her $2 - But she firmly stuck with $12 for some self-righteous reason and I question whether I ever want to return here.  Even though I'm a VEGAN who loves EVERYTHING JAMAICAN.    So disappointed.  As I eat and write this I'm finding the food isn't nearly as good as last time I was in either.  I was going to give 2 stars because I used to love this place and recommend it to everyone, but on second thought I'm never returning.  Good business is good customer service - not making the customer feel untrusted and under appreciated.  She wouldn't give me her name to add to the review; shame.  So I began reading the review to her because she was curious, and then she asked me to leave and called the police.  I did nothing wrong.  Terrible.  Terrible.  Terrible.  I need to learn to make Callaloo.  Big sigh."}
{"text":"The roti dough was the flakiest tortilla-type dough i have ate before. when we went at 6pm, the restaurant ran out of bean curd and callaloo. while the restaurant closed at 9pm that day. so my curry just had lima beans and i found the dish very plain. I liked the fried soft plantains though."}
{"text":"The delicious corn soup, bbq tofu and other healthful items have already been praised ad nauseam and so I'm here to shout about the coconut \"cream\" cupcake.  I LOVE THE COCONUT CREAM CUPCAKE.  Forget vegan, this is just a great treat. These are made by Sweets from the Earth and praise Jah, I had a transcendental cupcake experience. I only meant to taste a bit of the icing as I was saving it for my afternoon teatime. Suddenly the entire thing was gone in seconds.   Ladies and gentlemen, a magician named Nat *cue final countdown*"}
{"text":"Curried chickpeas and potato with avocado and sprouts... take out vegan food from One Love Vegetarian Restaurant   They made me half a vegan!  The spices were just right and it was absolutely filling. I would definitely go back for seconds. I even had left overs for lunch. It was so so soooo good.  The lady who tended to me was wonderful. I didn't know they didn't accept debit or credit and she said to me \"it's okay, next time you pay me.\" It was my first time at the location. She said \"a stomach should always be full, whether there's money or not.\" Needless to say, I went to the bank right away to grab cash and paid immediately.  The only downer is there are no washrooms. But other than that, hold it in for this meal. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"I would eat here every day if I could. It's more of a take out place but you can stay and eat, too. The people who work here are so nice and they play the best music. The corn soup is everything, the rotis are insanely filling but not greasy, the callaloo and BBQ tofu are delicious. Grab a home made ginger beer and a cupcake if you have room, too. I love One Love."}
{"text":"The best! I've been to every roti place in Toronto and this is my favourite. Healthy, clean and fresh, and legit!! Love this place:)"}
{"text":"Great fast service was the starting... Always good! The amazing tofu BBQ was the topper!!! I'm not a fan of tofu in most cases but they do it justice. Also, the beancurd/Lima bean currie was fantastic! The fresh juices are great too! The mango juice was so fresh as was the raspberry lemon. Highly recommend you check this place out whether your vegetarian or not!"}
{"text":"I've tried the corn soup (one of the best soups in the city according to BlogTO) and the chickpea potato curry and both are INCREDIBLE! The people who work here are so sweet. Just make sure you bring cash--they don't accept debit!"}
{"text":"\"One love... one heart... let's get together and feel alright....\"  Some haters once told me that I won't survive in the Caribbean because I'm vegan and everything there has meat in it. However, one day one of my closest friends, who supports me in everything I do, (including my vegan conversion), took me to this restaurant and told me that it serves vegetarian Caribbean food. This Jamaican-operated, vegan/ vegetarian friendly venue is a small little restaurant that is just north of Bathurst Station. While this place is mainly for take-outs, they also had room for people who want to dine-in, which is what my friend and I did.   The menu was written on a dry-erase white board, although it was quite limited, everything seemed delicious and I wanted to try it all! The menu features vegan friendly roti, with your choice of 3 different types of filling and 2 different shells: white/ whole wheat; their signature corn soup, about 3-4 different vegan entrees, a selection of beverages including their own liquid creations, and also desserts. I ordered the corn soup and a regular whole wheat roti with Jamaican pumpkin filling. The soup was SOOOOO good. The portion for a small bowl was sufficient for 1 soup-loving person (especially for those who loves soup and can never have enough), the soup was full of flavor, it was also hot (I hate lukewarm soups), and it came with a generous amount of vegetables. The regular-sized roti was equally as amazing and surprising big. The pumpkin filling was cooked to a soft mush, hot (again not lukewarm), and incredibly tasty.  I love pumpkin! But I'd never had cooked pumpkin at a restaurant before this place. I normally bring home a whole pumpkin (either from the grocery store or my grandma's garden), hack it open with a butcher's knife, scoop out the seeds and cook it with garlic and black beans.   The table next to us had ordered the large roti,  which is HUGE -I actually think that's too much for 1 person to consume in one sitting, unless you're really hungry. My friend and I shared the regular roti, which was a wise move, because I wouldn't have been able to finish it.    For anyone who thinks vegetarian food is bland and tasteless, you should give this place a try and I promise you, you'll totally eat your veggie-shunning words. This place is amazing: the owner and servers are so nice and friendly, the restaurant is clean, well-lit and cozy, the food tastes GREAT and since it's vegan, it's also healthy and good for you, and lastly, the big bonus: it's NOT expensive! The prices are SO fair for the quality and quantity you receive, thus breaking the myth that vegan/ vegetarian food/ restaurants are expensive and the portions are small. You will definitely leave this place full, enlightened about vegan food, satisfied and happy. ONE LOVE fo'sho!"}
{"text":"Yum! This has been my favourite place for take-out dinners in the city for years now and I'm so lucky to live nearby (though I'd cross town to get it if I had to!) The BBQ Tofu dish is delicious and I can't go one week without it. My tiny complaint is that sometimes the BBQ tofu dish is missing veggies it has on other days and is more bean-heavy--I miss the additional flavour of the veggies on those days, but I could never bring myself to give this place anything but a 5/5 because it's so delicious.  The prices aren't exactly low, but they're not too high. You are getting fresh ingredients and delicious vegan food cooked in an open kitchen before your eyes -- I say, it's worth every penny.  Oh, and the owner is wonderfully nice. Always a pleasure to stop by to pick up my order!"}
{"text":"Loved the mixture of flavors, some really wonderful vegetarian dishes.  Personally found mine had a bit too much rice, I had the BBQ Tofu. The plantains in the dish were so delicious! Next time I'd try one of the Roti's, seems to be what they're well known for."}
{"text":"Headline: Decent vegan food, but pricey.    Date of most recent visit before review: 12/24/2013 # of Visits: 1 Food order(s): BBQ tofu stir fry, small corn soup   Pros:   -BBQ tofu stir fry tasted almost on par with my mom's and I liked the fact it came with avocado.   -Everything is vegan -Corn soup has plenty of veggies and it tastes like it includes pumpkin and/or squash. -Entrees appear to be homemade by two nice ladies.  Cons: -It's pricey.  I paid $13.99 for my meal which is very pricey for lunch considering it is not a proper sit-down restaurant.  -While I liked the taste of the tofu stir fry, it tasted like the soy protein/bean curd you get at Chinese grocery stores that's pre-cooked.  Also, it was quite oily -For the price, I would have expected to get real cutlery and a real bowl instead of a take out container and an actual coffee cup for soup. -Corn soup, while great flavour seemed to have excess salt.  I had to drink 2 bottles of water and a coffee to clear out the after taste.     Verdict: I think it's good food, nice people, but too pricey and lacks creativity in their dishes for a pure vegetarian meal.  Would visit again, but more like a once every 3-4 months."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place today, their claim to fame is selling corn soup at the harborfront every year, but the line has always been too big, so when they opened their own restaurant right across from Bathurst Station I had meant to try them out, finally today I got around to it.  We both had the small soup (plenty big enough) and the lady at the counter (who was super friendly) brought us some hot sauce (wow, was it ever hot!!) We both had cafe americano's too (I was silly and asked for regular milk in it, not realizing the whole place was vegan). Coffees with almond milk was very good. The soup was fantastic, it was more like a vegetable soup than a strictly corn one. It was clear that they cook this stuff all day, (not like some places that fill their soup with starch) it was great. I wasn't hungry, but the soup was good enough we were looking at the rest of the menu (even though we are both meat eaters)  Certainly look forward to going back."}
{"text":"One Love is my favourite place for off-island West Indian fixin's right after my mom's kitchen. I absolutely love the corn soup which has a Caribbean pumpkin broth, peas, potatoes, carrots and big slice of corn on the cob in every bowl. It's chunky amazing and not to be skipped. They even sell it in a cup at the Vegetarian Food Fair at the Harbourfront every September, along with bbq curry corn on the cob.  Every time I visit One Love is like a mini trip to the West Indies in my mouth. My favourite roti is a mix of the pumpkin and the potato chickpea in a paratha. They also sell ginger beer and sometimes around Christmas there's fresh sorrel juice to accompany your rotis.  The price has always been a little above what you'd pay at your average, rundown take-out roti joint, but frankly this place is a lot nicer. The service is fast, especially when you consider that I have waited more than 45mins for a vegetarian roti, and that was here, not even in the Caribbean. All the ingredients at One Love are fresh and healthy. I don't have to worry that I'll find a big ole hunk of \"rank goat meat\", as my grandmother would say, or chicken XO in the rice and peas. Since I can't get a guaranteed vegan Caribbean meal anywhere else in Toronto without running to mama, it's worth that lot more in my books.  Seating is limited, only about 7 chairs, so don't plan to dine in if your party exceeds 2-4. You need to ask for hot sauce to accompany your roti if they don't offer it immediately. You add it yourself, which is exactly how I'm used to doing it in the Caribbean. It's also nice for your spice intolerant dinner guests.  Don't forget to finish your meal off with a Sweets from the Earth vegan cupcake, cookie or muffin."}
{"text":"Everything I ate here so far impressed this meatatarian Only draw back is its more pricier then I expected for a vegetarian place. The fresh juices are amazing 5/5 for all drinks!"}
{"text":"Having had our honeymoon in St Lucia and enjoying the local food there, when we came back to Toronto we had a serious craving for some good Caribbean eats.  One Love does not disappoint,the flavours are a true Caribbean experience.    The BBQ Tofu plate - delicious The Roti's - delicious  The curry plates were also really good. We tried it all in a very short span!"}
{"text":"I've only been here a couple of times because the rest of the time I tried to eat here they were randomly closed. Nonetheless, the food is great and you can really taste the freshness and LOVE in the food. Even if you're vegetarian or whatever you want to label it. It's still a pretty good spot. They only have one big table that is shared amongst whoever is dining it there. Cash only though!"}
{"text":"The best vegetarian food in Toronto. I usually come to this place once a month whenever I have the time to drive up to Bathrust. It's worth the drive every time."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian, I love this place.   The chick peas and potato roti is great.  The corn soup one of the best soups I've ever eaten.  Friendly staff, terrific addition to this city!"}
{"text":"Memory bring me back to that one time at Harbourfront, the first time I had their corn soup -- It was amazing. Spicy and very flavourful with a strong hit of corn and lots of herbs. So soothing for the soul.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same of their roti. It was a little bland, pricey and a strange size. Considering how flavourful the soup is, I was expecting a little more from the filling. It tasted like well, chickpeas, lots of it and not much else. Neither salty, nor spicy, nor fragrant...etc. You do taste the effort though. Everything taste fresh and made to order, the roti itself had a nice chew to it while it's light and airy. Lastly, I question the portion size. Not quite enough for a meal but yet way too big for a snack. It will be difficult to finish 2 but eating 1 would leave you maybe 3/4 full. I would rank this in the bottom of my list of roti's in the city. Go for it if you're feelin' a bit desperate today."}
{"text":"Can't believe I waited so long to try this Seaton Village gem! Believe the corn soup hype: it is just as delicious as the reviews say. Fresh corn kernels with pumpkin, potato and other veggies in a flavorful, well-seasoned broth. Outstanding! Also had the paratha-wrapped roti with a mix of two fillings: seasoned pumpkin and chickpea/potato curry, with delicious house-make hot sauce. The wrapping was fluffy and soft, the filling addictive, and the size was HUGE!! I didn't think I would be able to finish it, but it was so delicious I somehow found the space :) Lunch at One Love is going to be happening again for me very soon!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. After I eat here, I dream about this place and can never wait to go back for more. As another reviewer put it, it's not just good vegan food, it's good food period (I am not vegan, and every other non-vegan I've brought here has loved it as well). I'm absolutely addicted to their potato and chickpea curry. The fried plantains are delicious, as is their hot sauce and their fresh juice of the day. Anytime I'm in the area I make it a point to stop here, and you should too. You won't regret it. Just be sure to bring cash as they don't take credit cards."}
{"text":"I came here for chickpea roti. I really liked the roti. The roti is huge, and I could only finish half. The prices here are slightly on the high side. It's nice to see that everything is vegetarian/vegan."}
{"text":"First visit review...corn soup good but in my book not worth the superlatives I've seen tossed around. For $4 +tax you get the small (about 10 fl. oz. served in a paper cup). I also ordered the small pumpkin roti and the juice of the day ($7 and $6 respectively, exclusive of taxes). The soup is chock full of veggies and with a small roti is definitely filling. The Jamaican pumpkin roti also had potatoes in it. I think if I asked they might've done a mix and thrown chickpeas or whatever else in there. The shell was flakey, but I'm glad I didn't order it plain to go with my soup - I've been spoiled by the parathas at another small joint I frequent and would've been dissatisfied by the taste plain. The food would've topped this review at around a 3.5 - what pushed it higher is the fact that I didn't get mocked for asking for just a little hot sauce in my roti, that the interior of One Love is perfect, and that my pineapple ginger juice was fantastic. I will be back to try the BBQ tofu and desserts!"}
{"text":"I have to say this is definitely the best vegetarian food you will come across. They do not have a big menu but everything is delicios and worth trying."}
{"text":"Their food IS love. This is the food I eat when I need to feel better and when I want to take good care of myself. I also like the people. You can tell they spend a lot of time choosing the ingredients. One time I had a raspberry lemonade that was over the top good. My friend was concerned about the price, and then she tasted it. \"Holy Sh*t, this is good!', she said. This is healthy, delicious 'love food'. If you want 'service' you may not like this place, you don't rush here. If you want a good relationship with your food and the people who make it, there's only 'One Love'!"}
{"text":"We decided to play menu-roulette here.  Just chose some random things.  No plan.  Seemed harmless enough.  Turned out awesome.    Great flavors.  Wonderful textures.  True home-cooked goodness."}
{"text":"Had the calilloo, yummy but TINY portions. Disappointing for the price and kinda bland."}
{"text":"Love this place!   Everything is great, but I could eat their BBQ Tofu every day for the rest of my life, and I'm not even that into tofu. The rich and intensely flavored tofu jerk combines so well with the perfectly ripe avocado, sweet plantains, and perfectly cooked rice+peas that I have trouble deciding which to take a bite of next. I always mean to save half for later, but I can't control myself around this stuff. It is SO. GOOD.   Also recommend the corn soup, paratha (getting all the fillings costs extra but is so worth it), and their rotating juice selection. Not completely sold on the beancurd and lima bean dish, but my SO is obsessed so maybe it's just a personal preference thing.   The people here are nice, although service can be slow. Simple decor, but the table and chairs are super beautiful. Apparently made of mango wood. Overall, I can't recommend it highly enough. Come here now, and bring cash."}
{"text":"While I try hard to support vegetarian restaurants, I found my roti horribly bland. No thanks, I'll stick to what I can get in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Great atmostsphere, music and friendly, irie vibe that compliments fine veggie food.  Metta, d"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food! I love the spiced pumpkin roti, but you can't go wrong with anything on their menu. Amazing curries and flavours! I hope One Love stays open for as long as I live in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is freakin' amaZING! I live in the neighbourhood, but I only started eating here when a dear friend brought me to enjoy some good lovin' vegetarian food! I was floored when I tasted the deliciousness that comes out of that kitchen. Seriously, rendering me speechless, which is a strong statement. In essence this place serves up,  pure LOVE in food form. I go back now and again when I can and always fall back on to the same... BBQ Tofu and Cold Ginger Beer (Caribbean Style- THE BEST kind! ) -- you could also order the ginger beer HOT, but cold, to me is more refreshing. I recommend going there right NOW!"}
{"text":"Came in a grabbed the chickpea curry on rice. It was so delicious and the plate was loaded. I really enjoyed the variety that came with it too: curry, brown rice, kale, carrots, ripe avocado and fried plantains. A wonderful veg meal and for $10 you get a massive portion."}
{"text":"I'd say 3.5*    One Love has been on my bookmarks for many, many months, but I was just able to visit it yesterday.  It's literally not even a block North of Bathurst Stn.  I was able to see the subway station from where I was sitting!  Please note, the cafe is primarily take-out.  So your food will be served in a plastic container, wrapped in wax paper, &/or come in a paper cup.  So don't expect any frills.  I should've taken a photo of the menu posted, but as per Bernie's review, the prices were a tad higher than I'd expect for takeout.  1 - sm corn soup, 1 curry meal, & a ginger beer was ~$22.  I shared a meal, so it wasn't bad considering that.  Curry meal was definitely MORE than 1 portion!  I believe rotis were ~$12ea.  And I think I saw that the ginger beer was $6...that's A LOT of either love &/or ginger!  ;)  Corn soup was really good!  Not too salty.  Ginger beer had a sting to it, as expected, and was really refreshing!  Curried bean curd & lima beans were good too.  Ingredients looked really fresh, especially the avocado and the side salad that came with the meal.  Ladies who worked there seemed nice.  A coupla people who I assumed came in to chat, 1 sat down to eat, and seemed to know the people working there, so there is a nice community feel to the place.  Would definitely stop by again if I was in the neighbourhood and wanted something homey...and vegetarian!"}
{"text":"This was such a great place !!! Everything was delicious!! I highly recommend. The staff was very friendly and teased me a little because I'm from the states. So if you go there tell them you know mark. That's There friend from jersey."}
{"text":"Upon approaching One Love Vegetarian, I could already see the vibrantly coloured decor through the floor to ceiling windowed storefront. As I swung the glass door open, the rich smells of the Carribbean fare greeted me. My dinner date who had arrived earlier than our agreed upon time of 7pm had luckily been able to claim one of the three little two-tops that filled the small front dining area.  Off of the whiteboard listing the simple card of soup, wraps, meals, and desserts, we quickly and excitedly both decided on the same thing: the spicy corn soup ($3/small) that was full of flavour and spotted with wholesome chunks of veggies and the BBQ tofu ($10) which was sided with fried plantains, organic basmatic with beans, and topped with a creamy slice of ripe avocado.  Despite the eatery's emphasis on take out, the service from the friendly couple was tops. Our food was brought to the table in proper tablewear with metal cutlery. Refills of icy cold water flavoured with citrus slices and herbs were brought with big smiles every time. Meanwhile, a steady flow of customers who came in to pick up food to go were served efficiently througout our meal.   Just before packing it in at 9pm, an announcement was made that we didn't have to go home, but that if we wanted to stay, there would be some dishes for us to do. Couldn't we just linger on and bask in the warmth and comfort a little longer?, we begged only half jokingly. As all good things that we can't get enough of though, One Love has got us wanting more."}
{"text":"expensive and poor service.  they get two stars because the roti really is good. however, the insides of the potato roti i got were fairly bland.   but   they are just horrible servers! maybe it was an off day.   after ordering, i go up to the counter and ask if i can get a water. the guy tells me i need to buy a water bottle if i want water. huh? what about the water over there at the tap?  then, while i'm sitting down they call to me and say my ginger drink is ready. literally 5 feet from me. they can't bring it over as a courtesy? is there something wrong with me? i see you walking out and talking to other customers. but you gotta call me over?  finally, to top it all off, they just put my roti sandwich up on the counter. do not tell me it's ready. i am not facing the counter. only when i get up and go over and ask \"hey is this mine?\" and they say \"yes\" do i finally get it.   the attitude here is horrible. the food has to be PHENOM to endure this, and, alas, it is not."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today to try the famous corn soup. The staff is so friendly and the environment is so inviting. My soup was perfect. Everything I would expect of a jamaican chicken soup minus the meat. I'm impressed that they were able to basically replicate the flavours of jamaican chicken soup without the meat. I also like that all the vegetable were cut up very fine.   Next time I come back I'm going to try some other things on the menu but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow just came here to check out how good this place was (Bc so many people highly rated his place) and I gotta say, this place is AMAZING. I tried the BBQ TOFU dish and the tofu is cooked and seasoned to its perfection. Their rice and plantains really compliment the flavours of the tofu and to top all the flavours all off, the avocado gives a smooth but savoury kick to the whole dish.  Its so simple yet so delicious! I cannot wait to try out their other dishes the next time I come back here.   P.s the staffs were super friendly as well."}
{"text":"The food had a very home-cooking feel to it.  The selection was small, with only a handful of main dishes.  The two dishes we ordered (jamaican greens and the chickpeas and potato curry) were both pretty good.  Neither dishes were greasy.    The yellow yam in the jamaican greens was really good.  The mango drink was really good too.    The bad thing about this place is the lack of restroom and cash only."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant that combines carribean flavour and vegetarian dishes. Prices are reasonable ~11-12 per dish and very filling and flavourful.   I got the tofu dish and the corn soup, both are delicious and would highly recommend! It's cash only though so make sure you bring enough cash! They also have vegan baked goods  UPDATE: went back to this place and have to downgrade it from 5 to 3.5 stars. There's no washroom here so it's very inconvenient and it's more or less a takeout place. We got the roti which is still delicious but there was very little actual filling of potatoes and chickpeas and more of the roti shell.   We also got the callaloo and it's mostly yams and very little greens. Not really worth the $ for the type of food you're getting.   All in all, disappointed in this second experience."}
{"text":"FEEL GOOD FOOD! It's tiny in there - probably seats about 6 people or so. Not an enormous menu but covers a great variety. We had pumpkin and chickpea/potato parathas.  Both mega tasty and filling. We also had the Callaloo Meal with yellow yam, boiled green bananas, organic whole wheat dumplings and avocado! To die for!  Not only were we completely filled, it all just felt like good home cooking. Take out has never sat so right in my body. Also had a coconut cream cupcake - which I wish I had right now! Damn :("}
{"text":"Consistently great tasting food! Love the BBQ tofu and the rotis. Friendly staff, convenient location."}
{"text":"I'm typing my review before I read any other Yelp ones.  I was there yesterday, set to give this place a nice props up.  Which I will do, for their sincere and kind service.   I thought I was open to most meals out there, but I ordered the Callaloo ($10.99) and the small corn soup ($3.) and couldn't finish it.  The taste, and even smell, didn't work for me.  This place has been in business for a while, and others seem to enjoy it.  I'd definitely say hey, try it out.  But it's just wasn't, for me or my husband.    Maybe I should have tried other dishes?  Their mixed cherry drink special looked very appealing, as did their cookies.  I thought about ordering a roti of theirs.  Would I try them again?  Maybe. I just, personally, wouldn't be craving any of what I last ordered there."}
