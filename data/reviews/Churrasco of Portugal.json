{"text":"So happy to have Portuguese food in Durham!  Service was great, and the food was delicious.  You have to ask for kids menu options as it isn't on the regular menu.  We knew to ask for the hot sauce.  The regular sauce is also quite flavourful, but the hot sauce has heat and flavour, and isn't just oil that falls right off the food.

Both takeout and eat-in are terrific and great value considering the large portion sizes."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I have to say this was the worst Portuguese chicken and round potatoes I have ever had. I love Portuguese chicken and this lacks so much flavour. not sure why they put their bbq sauce on their chicken. no other Portuguese chicken restaurant does this and their round potatoes taste boiled.  I was really disappointed because I moved from Toronto and got excited to have a Portuguese chicken place in my area. major bummer."}
{"text":"got the chicken rice dinner it was mouth watering
i love the sauce they use on chicken.
ill be back"}
{"text":"It's not Red Rooster which is what I compare all Portuguese chicken to, but it is good chicken and affordable you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"i've been there a few times.. first few times don't know what to order... but the last few times i was here... ordered what's on their restaurant name.. Churrasco Chicken... with the potato balls... these chickens are perfect... delicious... some other food might be too authentic for newbies in portugal food... but their signature chicken won me over... its a block from swiss chalet... and now i understand why swiss chalet always empty"}
{"text":"Not a bad Portuguese restaurant. Friendly staff, decent food. Not child unfriendly, but lacking in kids options. 

Chicken dinner was good, potatoes are amazing and flaming sausage appy is a must try."}
{"text":"Just left the restaurant. I have been to a few really good Portuguese Chicken places in my time . The Red Rooster being the best. First we were completely ignored as if we didn't belong there. The food came very slow even though there was no one else in the place. The food was ok, the chickens are small. A half chicken here is the size of a quarter chicken at Swiss Chalet.
 The biggest surprise came when we got our bill. A 19.50 meal does not come out to 26.50 with tax. Nor does a 15 meal come out to 19.75. You can see the cost of the items listed, yet the numbers do not add up. Before you ask, we were only 3 people, not enough to generate a automatic tip being added. They only gave us out debt receipt, not the itemized receipt to justify the cost. Buyer beware."}
{"text":"Omg terrible! They don't clean their chicken properly and my chicken was better once I fried it on the stove! Wish I could come back here but I'm not paying those prices for half poor food"}
{"text":"Came here for takeout on saturday and boy was it packed! Probably 15-20 minute wait. When you first walk it it feels like a like store with snacks and stuff for sale.  Ordered 2 bbq chickens, some Parisienne potatoes, some rice and saw some pork rinds on the counter so a small order of that.    Went to timmy ho's and grabbed a coffee returned to pick up my order.  Started eating the chicken and it was moist and delicious!  Even the white might was nice and tender.  The potatoes were so soft they like melted in your mouth.  The rice was pretty good.  The pork rinds are the perfect kind of snack to go with an ice cold beer. Whole chicken only 11 dollars.  Good Value! Good Taste! I'd return if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Pretty good Portuguese joint in the heart of Ajax. We always get the classic chicken meal served with a heaping portion of rice and potatoes. The staff is always very kind and we love with how generous they are with their peri peri sauce servings. It's not the best ambience to sit and eat there, but excellent for take out! Especially if you're craving a home cooked meal."}
{"text":"Lovely staff, good food. Being Portuguese you don't find many authentic places around and the food here is similar to the dishes I enjoyed growing up. My favourites are the sole fillet, bacalhau and of course potatoes and rice. There is also a fridge & freezer section (I love that they have passion fruit drink) and a dry section with snacks."}
{"text":"My husband and I have always enjoyed the take out food from this restaurant so we decided to use it for catering our Christmas party. We were very pleased with the quality, taste and portions of the food. The price was reasonable as well! Would definitely use it again for take out or catering!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since we moved in this area. This is my first try to eat a portuguese food. The chicken is a bomb and served with their rice and potatoes. It just goes together. The chicken is perfectly cooked its not dey and not burned and add to that a sauce and everything is just amazing. Will keep coming to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I really like Portuguese rotisserie chicken and this place definitely has good chicken.  For dinner we bought a whole rotisserie churrasco chicken ($13) and got a side of parisian potatoes and rice.  It was very good.  The sauce they put over it is really good too but they never seem to put enough of it even though I always ask for extra.  The chicken is very moist and you I love the smoky flavour of the chicken.  The potatoes are good but a little on the oily side. 

The reason I give this place 3 stars as the service is not great and unfriendly.  We came in for takeout and there were maybe 3 people ahead of us and it took a while for us to get served.  Not sure why as everything that people ordered was already cooked so they just needed to put them in to containers.  It wasn't as if there was only one person behind the counter.  Not only that but when I was being rung up I asked for some extra sauce on the side as they only gave one small container.  I wanted an extra one as I had just purchased a whole chicken.  I went to pay and realized the price was higher than what it should have been and when I asked why the lady said the extra sauce was $1 more.  This was a little irritating as she didn't even bother to tell me until I asked her about it.  Not only that it's just bad business.  I have been here numerous times before and have never been dinged for extra sauce.  I really don't like how they are starting to nickel and dime their customers.  I had been thinking about using them to cater a party but I think I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"A review of the catering food. 

Oh wow, I liked the food so much from a family get together. We had several dishes, and I tried all of food ordered. We had fried calamari rings, bacalhau a bras (\"shredded salt cod mixed with matchstick fries and bound with scrambled eggs\"), carne de porco a alenteja (\"sauteed pork cubes and fried potatoes with clams and olives), caesar salad, rice, pork chops, and chicken with piri piri on the side. My favourite was the salted cod dish, YUmmmy. Truly! 

The only bad thing is that I don't live anywhere near this store. I am still thinking about this food days after. The food was not spicy but not bland. Yes, I don't eat much Portuguese food...I want to, now!!! We ended the late lunch with pudding from Nova Era. 

I have no pictures because I was enjoying the food so much. Let's just say that what you see from their catering site, that's the food you get. Thank you Churrasco!"}
{"text":"The chicken is decent, the sauce not so much. 

I asked for spicy and it became apparent they dont do spicy. 

Not a very good experience overall as Nando's and Costa Verde are far superior and closer to where I live. 

I would like to give them three stars but it is not A-OK, just okay and decent for the area just not for Portuguese chicken

with that said staff is friendly and will let you place order in advance so you do not have to stand around waiting

If you are tired of swiss chalet give it a try, if you are looking for authentic, tasty Portuguese chicken unfortunately you should try somewhere else"}
{"text":"What keeps us coming back to Churrasco of Portugal is the amazing bbq chicken. For $10 you get a whole chicken that's cooked to perfection and covered in their amazing sauce. I recommend having the extra hot sauce on the side if you want to add a little bit more spice but not too much heat. The portions are generous and I recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"This was a good restaurant. Chicken was really good. Cooked well and I loved How it was prepared. The rice side was good. Tose potatoes though were excellent. Not sure how exactly they are prepared or what they are called but they were really good. Service was a little lacking though. But to be fair it was one guy looking after a full restaurant."}
{"text":"We love this place!! We get 2 half chicken meals with rice, potatoes and a side salad. It's all soooo delicious!! 
I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because the service could be way better. As a privately owned business we are always so surprised with the lack of friendliness in the staff (usually the lady that works the counter and packs up take out meals). We are always very friendly and are always met with the feeling we are bothering her."}
{"text":"Wife and I love churrasco and decided to check this place out as it's the only place in Ajax I think.  Nice, clean and friendly service!  Food was great except not as hot as I prefer it to be.  The chicken was yummy and so were the sides (rice and Parisian potatoes).  I do prefer the roasted potatoes that I have had at other Portuguese restaurants, but these were still yummy.  Make sure you ask for the hot sauce!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went to a family gathering and the host ordered some food from this place so this review is for take out only.
What does one think of when one thinks of Portuguese food??  The chicken of course!  
We ordered a tray of Portuguese Chicken,  vegetable rice ,  Parisian potatoes and some fries fish fillets... It was excellent!  The hot sauce was real nice... Spicy but full of flavour..
Total time from order to pick up till pick up was about 1 hour so very reasonable for catering.
Apparently the older gentleman was very nice.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"One of the best places in Durham region to eat.  The person who said it taste like Metro chicken needs to see a doctor regarding a possible tumor that is affecting their taste buds.  The BBQ chicken is absolutely delicious and a great deal.  The people are nice and clean."}
{"text":"Passed by this place randomly while out in the boonies of Ajax.

I was served right away on my takeout order which took long as hell.

Ordered the Chicken sandwich for $7.50 and was pleased to see that it came with fries which it didn't mention on the board.

Fries were mehh, regular frozen fries. The chicken sandwich was a joke, they barely put any chicken in the sandwich, like I mean almost nothing, they are stingy as hell.

Do not waste your time."}
{"text":"If you live in the area and are looking for an affordable and tasty meal, go here. Enough said."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favourite Portuguese places. I have not dined it but I have ordered catering from here a few times and it is fresh, filling and affordable. We ordered the bbq chicken, potatoes, steamed veggies and rice. You have to ask for their hot sauce and slather it on everything. It is so addictive, I don't even lick my fingers and I wanted to lick my fingers. I have absolutely no complaints and definitely will return."}
{"text":"This is a excellent restaurant. You'll have to go downtown Toronto to find authentic food like this."}
{"text":"Food was really bland. I ordered takeout and and got dry tasteless chicken. Not exactly the warmest reception either. The sauce was passable. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"As I lay in bed writing this review I am still reminiscing over my succulent chicken dinner....it was just that good!

Ok back to my review...
When I first walked into this restaurant I wasn't quite sure what I was in for as it was a long narrow aisle with dry goods on one side and refrigerated items on the other side with a hot food counter off in the distance. As I came closer to the counter I could see around the wall there was a dine in area with a few tables and patrons being served as well what looked like a large family dinner/party ending and being cleaned up. I was here to get some take out though so I glanced above to the menu board before making my choice.

I was warmly greeted by a lady behind the counter who patiently waited while I made my decision. I decided to keep it standard and just went with two half chicken dinners and a small greek salad. There were a few ladies behind the counter all busy prepping food. It was nice to see the open kitchen and chicken being freshly grilled and cooked. My order was ready within minutes and she kindly packaged it all up for me.

Driving home I could hardly wait to dig in.
Upon opening our containers of food Hubby and I were both astonished by the amount food we received. They definitely are very generous here. Four hearty pieces of juicy chicken laying upon a bed of vegetable rice and a mound of parisienne potatoes all drapped in that delicious peri peri sauce.
First of all the chicken was the true highlight of the meal it was sooo incredibly juicy and tender with a crispy skin and subtle smokiness to it. Oh and the sauce my god I'm hooked! (ok maybe the sauce was the real winner) It was tangy, lemony, creamy, and little spicy. The meal comes with a small container of sauce as well. I couldn't help but dunk every morsel of meat into it and those crispy little parisienne potato balls were just the perfect bites for dunking! The vegetable rice adorned with peas and carrots was well seasoned and just the perfect compliment to go with the chicken.
We also ordered a small greek salad on the side which was hefty enough for two to share and again they were soo generous on the feta and it came with a lemony oil based dressing on the side.
I will definitely be making repeat trips here. Everything was delicious, fresh, hot and flavourful. Portions are very generous and prices are affordable especially for the amount of food you are getting. Next time I'll be sure to purchase a bottle of the sauce so I'll have ample for dipping and dunking always on hand."}
