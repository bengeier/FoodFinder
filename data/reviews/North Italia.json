{"text":"We had a fantastic experience here! We went on a Thursday evening and with the misters on, it was still very pleasant sitting outside, even in June. The wine list was extremely affordable - most between $25 and $60. For Scottsdale, this is a steal! We shared an appetizer and a main entree. The appetizer was delish. Grilled bread (perfectly grilled, not so hard that it hurts your gums) with three spreads - an amazing goat cheese and marscapone, eggplant, and hummus. Also, they serve house bread with a great sun dried tomato butter. For our entree, we shared the fish special, which was a sea bass with artichokes, fingerling potatoes, and spinach. Fantastic. The service was also great.   I've come to expect any service in Scottsdale to be rude but  this place wasn't! Maybe we were lucky, but I enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible service. Holland, my server was absolutely accommodating to my needs, and was very knowledgeable. She definitely went above and beyond what was expected, and exceeded what my idea of what a great guest experience is. I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"A fantastic lunch spot. I had a chance to show my parents the Kierland area and I chose NoRTH to feed them. It probably helps that it was a beautiful day out but as usual the food was great and the experience was made even better because of our server. I almost never remember a servers name because I doubt any remember mine but Sarah was the best I have ever had at any restaurant. She was helpful with the menu and was able to put up with my dad who usually gives them all a run for their money. She ended up sitting down and chatting for a little bit at our request and had just the best personality. They are lucky to have her there."}
{"text":"I am thoroughly impressed by this restaurant, its management, and its servers. My photo booth company (The Memory Makers) was hired to take pictures at an 18th birthday celebration at another local restaurant. Due to rainy weather, the party needed to be moved to a location with more coverage on the patio to keep the guests (and photo booth equipment!) dry. Six hours before the birthday dinner was supposed to begin the mother of the birthday-girl contacted North to see if they could accommodate a party of about 30 teens on their patio that same evening. The fabulous folks at North made it happen! The set up was beautiful - you would have never known that it was a last minute scramble!! When I got there to set up the photo equipment we had to move a few tables around, find a rug to cover up a cord that would have been a tripping hazard for both guests of the restaurant and the servers, and a few other adjustments. The manager and the servers were so gracious and helpful in moving everything around to maximize the space for the photo booth. The guests at the party had an amazing time. Because I was working I did not have the opportunity to eat but based on the other reviews of North on Yelp, I will definitely be back! Thank you, North!"}
{"text":"Great chicken and pasta dish.  Excellent service.  Loved sitting on the patio.  All Fox Restaurants are great."}
{"text":"Excellent menu selections, quality food and spectacular service by London. Nice job all around."}
{"text":"I hate to  give 2 stars...however, I know i must be honest in my experience and 2 stars portrays it's perfectly.  I had high hopes for this place considering all the wonderful reviews, but I was not a satisfied customer this Sunday during their brunch. This is only a review on brunch.    Service:  Mixed reviews.  First off, we walked into a 1/3 of a full restaurant with plenty of seating and prepared tables but were told it would be a 15 to 20 minute wait.  WHAT???  Why not seat us and at least give waiting patrons drinks.  We figured it was short staffed and thought we would just grab a coffee at the bar that had 3 servers behind it and less than half the seats filled.  Apparently that was not going to happen smoothly.  The bartender didn't acknowledge us and when she did decide to help a customer it was one that came after us.  Already, a bad taste in my mouth.  Once she deiced to ask what we needed (a simple request for coffee), she asked her two colleagues to take care of it who then mumbled under their breath that they didn't wish to.  Possibly it was dissension between the three of them, but why make the customer aware of it.  In the end, we got seated before the three of them could decide who was in charge there.  Our server at the table was great and he made up for our first 2 awful experiences.  He was upbeat and knowledgeable.  Thank goodness.  Food:  Maybe I'm becoming a food snob, but North does not seem to have authentically made food.  It taste loaded with fat, salt and sugar.   I ordered something simple...Irish Oats with Apples with a side of scrabbled eggs and garlic toast.  The Irish Oats were very sweet but I will say I did love the whipped maple brown sugar mouse but realized they forgot to add the apples.. no big deal.  I just asked the waiter about it and very sweetly offered to bring me a side of them.  He then brought me another bowl of the oats which he didn't have to do so I thought it was a kind gesture.  However, as in the first bowl it was missing another ingredient..the candied pecans.  Somehow one ingredient goes missing.  :)  No harm, no foul, but just odd.  In addition, neither bowl was hot.  The second issue were with my eggs.  How can you mess up scrambled eggs??  The were LOADED with salt.  I assume it has to be an error since most restaurants let you salt your own eggs.  These salty eggs were certainly inedible. On the plus side, their garlic toast was pretty tasty.    I don't think I'll be back to North.  If I do return it will be to try their dinner menu and of course if I have a better experience I'll update this review.  Their breakfast and their service I will choose to pass on."}
{"text":"Excellent service and reasonably priced.  Mussels, Margarita pizza and a bottle of wine on the patio.....nice."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat at Kierland. I have had numerous items on the menu however the spaghetti and meatballs are my ultimate favorite! Since being a regular, I have had the pleasure of being served by Ryan R. He has always recommended other options and has tended to my every wants and needs. He is an excellent server and all the servers should be modeled after his outstanding customer service. Being in the restaurant industry is a rare occasion to have exceptional service. When grabbing a drink at the bar a fan favorite is always Shane. He is always one to chat with regulars and makes you feel comfortable at all times. In a nutshell north is a great restaurant with great staff!!! Love it"}
{"text":"Very good food, service and out door seating.  Would dine again!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and the food and service has been exceptional. I am going to assume that today was a fluke. I will continue to frequent North because the good far outweighs the bad of today. My advice is don't order the omelette with prociutto, unless you are craving airline quality food. The taste and texture reminded me exactly of the omelettes I have had when flying. Instead, opt for the white polenta and eggs, or the fried eggs in red sauce with Italian sausage. And the Red Rooster (bloody Mary) is outstanding. Please, North, take the omelette off the menu and you will be batting 1000."}
{"text":"Food is just average and a bit over priced.  Not up to the Fox standards I have come to expect."}
{"text":"North has a great happy hour.!  The  Sangria is amazing,  and the pizza is delicious.  Everything is delicious  :-) We always sit at the bar and we're always given friendly efficient service.  The only complaint I have is the bar stools are  very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Dined at North last week for a business dinner.  I don't eat out frequently due to dietary restrictions (gluten/dairy/refined sugar free). The kitchen at North was very accommodating and our waitress was highly knowledgeable about the menu items and provided excellent suggestions. I left very satisfied and beyond impressed."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious and tastes so fresh! We love coming here when we're in the mood for Italian and dropping the extra bucks. They give out bread though so you can indulge in a free appetizer. I definitely suggest trying the Peroni beer, Italian and tastes very smooth! I will say their dining area is very loud and they need to work on soundproofing the place. It also feels very crammed and you can hear everyone's conversation but hardly your own. It has a romantic, dim light appeal to it which I like, but it lacks the quiet intimate feeling of other upscale Italian restaurants. I still recommend checking it out and maybe sitting outside if it's an issue for you."}
{"text":"Daughters and wife took me here for Fathers Day, promptly seated on the patio around a great round table (party of 5) off to a great start !    We sat and sat ,.. 5  minutes before anyone said Boo! Then five glasses and a carafe of tepid water were placed on our table by someone who quickly ran away. Another five minutes, and our server swings by asks curtly if we have any questions about the menu, we ask a couple to which we get rote answers, she flys off leaving us with no more information than when she showed up.   She disappears for another 5 minutes before she comes back to take our order (we are now into our adventure 15 minutes) Orders are made around the table, and just as she takes a step to leave again, I stop her to ask if we might order some drinks? \"Oh Sure\" we place 3 drink orders,.. and ask about portion size of an appetizer, she confirms we need two,.. for our table of 5, I say \"fine ..lets do two\" 5 minutes later our drinks arrive (minuscule),  and 10 minutes after that our food arrives. No appetizers!    When asked, our server replies with \"Oh I thought you were just asking what it was,.. I didn't know you wanted some\" amnesia taking over for the whole \"If we order these,..how many do we need?\" conversation,.. not totally surprising as that conversation was now 20 minutes old.  By now,.. you have the flavor of the service,,.... slow, inattentive and well,.. absentminded.  (and this is the kinder/gentler me saying this)  OK,.. that said,.. the food was A++ very good and plenty of it. (the only reason I did not give it 1 star)   I am hoping this was an off day for the wait staff at North, because the competition in Arcadia is fierce,.. many options consistently outperform my Father's Day experience at North,.. I love FRC's food,.. but this service experience has repeated across several FRC restaurants, Sam; at your prices, you gotta get that service piece down!"}
{"text":"Sweet Moses Management, turn the music down!! This is a lovely street-side cafe - great for outdoor drinks, dining and people watching. Why trash it up with the blaring pop music, even on the patio?  Get some musical sophistication, or better yet abandon the noise pollution completely. We're there to converse, not listen to the radio."}
{"text":"Pretty good! We were here for an early dinner on a Friday night on Friday, June 12th and we had a great time. Probably not the best place if you have very small kids because the space is quite tight, the chairs won't comfortably seat smaller kids and it's a bit loud.   Our server was very nice and really went out of his way to chat with each of us (me, hubby, and two kids) and recommend dishes that everyone would enjoy.   What was good: - Server....he really made a big difference. I'm so sorry I forgot his name (his fault really, he recommended the bottle of wine and pizza deal and half a bottle really addles the brain!) - Dessert....we had the salted caramel thingie in a mason jar....it was very good, excellent really even though I cannot stand salty desserts. We also had the dark chocolate tart which has doubly awesome - it's not all dark chocolate, almost half the plate was the Nutella mousse so if you are not a fan of dark chocolate/bitter, order it...it's pretty mild.  - Pizza was great, loved the cheese, crust and everything on it. Must be the handmade dough.  - I added salmon to my salad and it was pretty much the best I've had...ever.   What was meh... - I was looking forward to the from-scratch pasta and it was kinda blah. I make my own pasta and look for restaurants that offer handmade pasta and surprisingly, their bolognese was not great. It was good...just maybe a victim of overly high expectations? - Ceasar salad had no anchovies....boo  - Servings were a bit small, fine for our family with small kids but if you have a teenager, you might have to double up. Prices were very reasonable so it's ok.   Only one black mark really...their hostess needs to go. Unfriendly, no eye contact, no smile, people waiting for a greeting while she looks at the dining room (for what?), and the overall, \"we're busy, you wait\" attitude. This was to my party, an older couple ahead of us, and a small group who drifted in from the bar. It really sets the servers up for a bumpy start."}
{"text":"Solid spot.  Great place to sit outside and people watch.   Nice affordable wine list.  Tasty sangria.  Pork tenderloin melts in your mouth!  Pizza is decent.  Avoid the bruschetta however - all four of us disliked it and couldn't finish the small pricey portion."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot for happy hour and casual dining with friends and family. Love the atmosphere here and the food is all incredible. I've tried a dozen different menu items and was impressed with every single one."}
{"text":"The patio is great.  They have a tasty house red.  The service was excellent.  That's the good...  I had the pesto pasta with chicken.  My girlfriend had the chicken parm.  It seems it would be difficult to strip flavor from Italian food but they managed it.  Both dishes were surprisingly, disappointingly bland.    Other things we noticed - it's very loud inside, so if you want to talk without yelling hit the patio.  It also seems a little pricy for what you get.  In short, if you're looking for some good Italian with a neighborhood feel do yourself a favor and make the short drive west to Giuseppe's (28th and Indian School.)"}
{"text":"After waiting with anticipation, we were there on the second night the restaurant was open.  The place was already jumping, and we were glad to have reservations.  With a friend, our party was three.  We started with salads all around--mixed vegetable, mixed vegetable with chicken, simple salad.  All were great.  Then it was on to prosciutto and fig pizza and filet of beef.  Both were really outstanding.  Dessert was an almond and mascarpone tart."}
{"text":"This place is yummy ! Food and service are fantastic. It can get a little crowded but we didn't mind . We will definitely return."}
{"text":"NoRTH solidified and provided affirmation to my opinion of Fox Restaurant Concepts as a whole.  This one is on par with the product they produce, and I will say that they do their thing well.  You know to expect a cool place; well decorated, creatively put together, very trendy, hip design and atmosphere.  Casual enough that you can go in and relax, but edgy enough that the yuppies and trendy socialites will like to be seen.  The food is good, but never memorable \"I need to go bag and have that ___\" good.  The ingredients are fresh and the meals are well prepared and creatively crafted, however, that's what you should get, for the price.    NoRTH is no exception to any of these predispositions.  The staff is good looking in their plaid attire to convey the casual-ness, and we were promptly greeted (and thanked on the way out).  After about a 10 minute wait we were seated at one of the high top tables in the bar area, which gave a nice vantage point to see the neat array of material used in construction.  The place is well staffed, service was as it should be, and everything was completed in a timely manner.  So lets start with drinks, shall we?  The wine list is a bit confusing, because many of the varieties aren't common nomenclature.  Maybe I'm wine ignorant, but to me, it seems as if it would have been more helpful to give a description of each, or at least order them from lightest to fullest body...anything to give you a clue as to what was what.   Looking to appetizers next, more menu questions arise.  There are some items on the front page that should be ordered a la carte, I guess? to assemble an antipasti board of sorts, but then there are full blown apps on the inside of the first page.  A bit confusing as to what is what.  We simply wanted some bread to go with our Italian fare, and since it wasn't included, we ordered the baked olive oil bread from the front page.  It was good, but neither the two of us or our server were sure that we were going to receive what we were seeking.    The dinner menu has some creative and fresh takes mixed with old standards, as you would expect from the fox brand.  A few more questions on what was what, and we had our decisions.  I embarked on the chicken wrapped in prosciutto, and my lady half took on the shrimp pasta dish.  Both came out in a reasonable amount of time, and were presented very well.  The food was good, nicely put together, and creative enough that you felt you weren't eating somewhere else.  The pasta dish she had was very unique, in a red sauce that was minty at first, spicy, then finishing in a basil-y sweetness.  The verdict is still out but it was a cool dish, and my girlfriend enjoyed it.  The prosciutto wrapped chicken was very nicely crafted on a bed of sauteed spinach with some fingerling potatoes that were delicious.  The chicken was prepared properly, although I thought I would have been maybe a little more moist considering it was wrapped in ham and so salty...I was expecting a brine effect of moisture.  Either way, both meals were good, but then again, it seems like they should be at $17 each.  Neither will leave me with the overwhelming urge to go back anytime soon, but I wasn't dissatisfied either.    To make it a true date night we finished it off with the nutella cake and vanilla gelato thing.  It was very decadent, the nutella cake portion was flour-less so almost like a mouse, topped with the cold and creamy gelato and chocolate covered espresso beans.  There was a nice contrast between the flavors, textures, and even the temperatures of the warm cake and the cool gelato.  This would serve as the highlight in my opinion.  So all in all, NoRTH to me is like every other fox restaurant, it's cool, good, consistent, maybe a little overpriced for food that is slightly casual, but it's good enough that they get away with it, and you realize you are paying for the ambiance and experience too.  It's another one of those places I know I can get a good meal, but leaves you searching for more if you like those rare finds that provide you with culinary perfection at the same price, or the complete package for slightly more.    3-stars is completely appropriate.  It's good, good enough that we will probably end up there again, but not good enough that you can't wait for that time to come.  Nothing really blows you away in terms for food, service, quality, ambiance, or any other intrinsic for that matters, so I'm not sure it would deserve any more stars, it's a solid \"good\"."}
{"text":"I loved the food and ambiance at North Italia restaurant in the Kierland Commons. The manager, Chris Gaughan, keeps the venue classy but casual and fun whether you're eating inside near the cozy fireplace or outdoors for a little more privacy. I had the delicious Antipasti dish and their signature Arugula-Calamari salad with a yummy bottle of Caparzo Rossi Di Montalcino wine.. (They also offer a top selection of very good wines). Next I had the strozzapreti which is homemade pasta with chicken, mushrooms, spinach, toasted pine nuts and Parmesan cheese. Others at our table enjoyed the Bolognese pasta and the Cheese Tortellini. All quite delicious. You can order a pizza here or indulge in a Salmon or steak. Fits everyone's appetite.  Be sure to make a reservation at (480)948-2055 as this gem stays busy. \" Delizioso!"}
{"text":"My family likes North, especially on sundays when it is happy hr all day. We do a lot of birthday celebrations here. Inexpensive pizzas and boards, great sangria. they were very kind to me yesterday when I got the pesto/chicken/pasta and wasn't thrilled with it and they brought me buccatini with meatballs instead. great service and fabulous patio. Love the pizza get \"the pig\""}
{"text":"Great service and good quality food.  Will visit here again next time I am in the area.  The homemade pasta is fantastic."}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday night for a date night with my boyfriend. Both of us had never been here before and we were craving some Italian food.  I had seen on the menu they make their pasta in house and the reviews looked good so we decided to try it. I am so happy we did! I had the bolognese pasta and he had the spaghetti and meatballs they were both excellent dishes. For desert we had some salted carmel thing I cant remember the name but it was delicious!!! We will definitely be returning. The service was great too!!!"}
{"text":"I just had the gnocchi with short ribs! My new favorite meal! So yummy:)"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  The mussels were delicious.  I also had the patata pizza which was incredible.  Would definitely return.  This is a must in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Just went here today for the first time.  Nice, clean, well lit, spacious dining experience.  Bloody Mary was good, and the pesto pasta was tasty and very fresh.  Also, nice clean personal restrooms, with nice scented soap!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Love the service, atmosphere and most of all the food! Buccatini with mushrooms, zucca chips, cocktails, salad.....Superb! As an Italian cook, it is hard to find a restaurant that REPEATEDLY serves truly good pasta, and North does it perfectly!"}
{"text":"Had a lovely brunch here and can't wait to go back for dinner. I had the fried egg sandwich which was delicious. My fiance had the frittata because he wanted as much veg as possible after his morning run. I enjoyed my sandwich so much that I didn't get a taste of his frittata. The ambiance was great and we had a bottle of Prosecco to enjoy over a leisurely brunch. I wished I had room for something sweet because a lady near us got the apple pie looking thing and it smelled so good. We debated getting a cinnamon roll to go but another diner near us had a half eaten one left on a plate which signaled to me that it was not to die for. So I passed.   My two complaints about the experience were: 1. The parking. was. ridiculous. There was a mostly empty lot but we were forced to use the \"complimentary\" valet. Complimentary my ass. You have to tip. That is not \"complimentary\". They should allow patrons to park themselves if the restaurant lot is less than half full. Otherwise... I might choose to go somewhere else that doesn't rip me off and waste my time with this nonsense. Seriously, I almost asked him to hand me the keys because the car was 20 feet away. Not cool.   2. The bowl for the potatoes with the egg sandwich is beautiful. However, it is not functional. It scoots all over the plate when you try to get a bite and it wobbles like crazy. Frustrating, because the potatoes were delicious but went unfinished because they were such a pain to eat."}
{"text":"North is located in the upscale Kierland Mall. It is not very big and on the  Monday night we were there it was full both inside and outside. It was also very noisy. The food is labeled \"Italian\" and is a variation on that genre. My antipasti plate had too many ingredients on it, none very distinguished. My fish was fine and the dessert good. Service was very good when the waitperson came over but we had to ask for water twice. Overall it's not bad but if you walk east another block you'll come to the better Zinc Bistro."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  My husband and I decided we would share The Pig pizza and Pesto Chicken pasta and we could not have been happier.  The fresh pasta made the pesto amazing....We also decided to try the tasty sangria which was so refreshing also!  If you are thinking about going just do it!  You will not be disappointed..."}
{"text":"The lasagne is excellent. The short ribs were ok, but they weren't spectacular. Service was good and attentive."}
{"text":"Review soley on customer service. Went to celebrate my sisters birthday tonight. It was my sisters and my first time at North.The waitress from the start had a snobby attitude. When our dinner was brought out one of my sisters had ordered pizza and no plate was given to her. She passed us a couple of times and never really bothered to check up on us. However, when we were just finishing up dinner our waitress brought us the check. I told her she didn't offer us dessert. She offered a quick \"sorry\" and took back the check. We had just barely finished eating. She did go and get menus but our birthday celebration was ruined. We felt rushed and couldn't enjoy the rest of our time there. Wish this night would have gone different for my sister. However, overall the food was ok, maybe it had something to do with the way we were treated. Don't think I would go back if this is common for North to have service that makes me feel unwelcoming."}
{"text":"While the brunch menu is more lunch in my opinion, I was pleasantly surprised when I received my egg sandwich.  The size was twice as expected. Not your tiny muffin sandwich.  What made the entree was the crispy potatoes. They are simply out of this world.  Top ths meal off with fresh oj, great service and atmosphere.  My new brunch location. Good job sam"}
{"text":"I love love love this place. Always great food and great service. Best Chicken Parm on the planet!"}
{"text":"We visited during \"happy hour\" where several menu options are offered for ridiculously cheap.  Salads were above average, especially the kale. Atmosphere was great; we loved the outdoor seating alongside Kierland Commons."}
{"text":"We came here after a baseball game, and we really enjoyed it.   We got there a little before Happy Hour was over so I ordered off the Happy Hour Menu. I had a glass of red wine $4, a sangria $4, and a margarita pizza $8 and split a spring salad with my Husband who ordered off regular menu tortellini with Squash and a brown butter sauce. Everything was delicious and the service was excellent.   You should give North a try it is delicious and great place for Happy Hour.  Hope you enjoy it as much as we did."}
{"text":"I have been driving by this place for months now, always thinking that I would like to try it out as it looked intriguing even from the outside. Last night my boyfriend and I were in the neighborhood and on a whim decided to give it a try. We will definitely be back! I do love the open concept of the restaurant. It is quite spacious inside, which was nice, since it allowed us to be seated right away on a Friday night at 7:30, yet it still felt cozy enough to be romantic. The wait staff was very prompt and friendly and very helpful when it came to recommending food. I love the fact that they make their own pasta and sausage, by the way, and had to try both - one in the form of the pork belly gnocci, the other as their sausage pizza. Both were so delicious, that we finished every last morsel on our plates. We even decided to give the desserts a try and had the salted caramel something or the other, which was a wonderful combination of flavors.  The one minus, and it is a small one, is that both my boyfriend and I smelled like food, as you are literally sitting in the kitchen. But it is a price I am very willing to pay again and again!"}
{"text":"Gnocchi with short rib, yes that was where it's at, the red sauced dishes looked appealing but this was the winner.  Gnocchi was really creamy with Mac and cheese like texture.  Everyone complained that their meal was only average next to mine.  Don't mess around, if you love short rib, just get it!!!!"}
{"text":"If you are into that see and be seen, well scene then this is a place you might like. The food was over priced, and ok... I guess. The service was horrible. Snotty, I'm too hot to be a waiter , what the hll do you want, attitudes totally ruined the experience for me.   For better, cheaper Italian food drive a couple miles south to Sauce. Same company, waaaaaaay better business model well, for us simple folk anyway."}
{"text":"I dined at this restaurant the other day for lunch to meet friend and I was very impressed with the service I received. I was waiting for my friend to arrive and she ended up being later than expected, however it didn't bother me because my server took the time to visit with me even though he was very busy. we was very knowledgeable, respectful and he was able to make me laugh and feel comfortable. The service was prompt and I really enjoyed the servers recommendation on the seasonal vegetable salad. It was by far the best salad I've had since I can remember. the only thing that bothered me was the noise level inside during the busy part of lunch. I suggest getting a patio seat if possible. Oh and when you go there, be sure to ask for a server named Kane, we was excellent."}
{"text":"We were not surprised by the quality of food as we had read the other reviews on here.  We made reservations for brunch at 10:45 and were the only people in there.  Th staff was friendly and offered up great suggestions and we decided to skip brunch and ordered off of the lunch menu.  Pasta, pizzas, dessert and drinks were all good and we shared family style.  The salted caramel pudding was amazing."}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time with some friends and it was very good.  Sat at one of the high top tables and Mandy who was the Bartendar was our server.  Loved her.  She was very nice, informative and really on top of things. We started out with the mussels and caesar salad.  Mussels were very tasty and you got a full pound.  For our meal we got the bolognese pasta, margherita pizza and the pig pizza.  The pasta and pizza dough are made fresh every day.  The pig pizza was a little salty for me but that is just because of all the different meats.  All the food was very good.  Not the best I've had but very good.  We will definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great ambience  & delicious food! I had the spicy shrimp pasta & it was absolutely amazing!!! The problem is the absolutely TERRIBLE  service!!!!!!!! They r slow, rude & unhelpful!!! Seriously it's a pity that the servers r so lacking!"}
{"text":"Eh, this place is not too good. I definitely wouldn't choose to return here.  The food is just OK, which makes it way overpriced for what it is. Nothing on the menu is special or unique. We also felt like our stomachs were carrying huge bricks after we ate here.  Our server was also rude and not very attentive. His mind seemed to be somewhere else the entire time, and it seemed like he didn't want to be there at all."}
{"text":"I like.  This restaurant is very inviting with a bright interior that looks like a fancy barn house.  There is a large outdoor seating area as well.  Fresh pasta is made in the open kitchen.  Upon the recommendation of the waiter, I ordered the ravioli filled with pork and mushroom in a light butter sauce.  The lemon zest is a refreshing addition.  For a starter, we also got the chef's board which includes 2 cheeses, 2 meats, and crusty bread.  Overall, the food is tasty.  The wine list is good.  -1 star because I do not like valet parking and the openness of the restaurant means flies are welcome to sample your food at the table..."}
{"text":"My husband and I just happened to stumble upon NoRTH one evening, because the wait at Houston's was too long and we just didn't have it in us to wait that long. A lover of Houston's (only the best french dip sandwiches in the world can be found at Houston's), I  have to admit  being a little sad and disappointed  with our taking leave and heading for another restaurant, but NoRTH was a nice surprise and great little find, therefore my sadness quickly waned. A really cool place, just really neat and the food was very tasty. Granted... there were no french dips on the menu, but they made up for it in other areas. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Melissa, the waitress was very attentive, she was great.  Bloody marry needs improvement, drinks in general were lousy.  I'm still not impressed with the food.  Schucks."}
{"text":"I had my last bad experience at North Kierland last night. OMG, their bartender Amanda, big dark-haired miserable girl - who hires people like that to work with the public. After two parties seated after us received their food, we asked Amanda about our order and she said \"I don't work in the kitchen,\" really? Then she was knocking over glasses, changed our receipt out 3 times finally taking one she threw in the trash and giving it to us. I don't know if she was drunk or on something. When we explained to the manager we were leaving Amanda stood behind the bar laughing. We eat out a lot and never run into the problems like we do at North. We are regular customers and this girl has never been good, been still received good tips from us in the past. Plus, one more warning, this place is SO LOUD, horrible acoustics, you can't even hear the person across the table from you."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great atmosphere, great food.  I love their marinara sauce - so simple and so yummy!  Great drink selection with a full bar. If you go, you must get the Zucca chips which are addictive.  Service has always been awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is disappointing.  I like the open feeling of the place ... even sitting inside feels like I'm outside.  The service we had was adequate.  But the food just isn't all that good.   I had the frittata (braised greens, potatoes, smoked mozzarella, arugula, grilled bread).  It sounds so tasty though I was expecting everything to be in the frittata except the bread but the arugula was on the side dressed with too much oil.  No real flavor.  The frittata had been covered with cheese and presumably reheated since it was lukewarm.  It was dry and bland.  I didn't taste any potato at all. The bread was average at best and could have used some butter and herbs.  I've been here once before a couple years ago and at that time I felt it was average.  I doubt I will return since it's not very close to me.  I would still consider it a great place for a drink.  I also want to address a prior reviewer who said Bolognese was traditionally served with linguine.  That is incorrect.  In Italy it's served with tagliatelle (which is very similar to fettuccine .. one is supposedly wider than the other but most people wouldn't be able to tell the difference).  The restaurant is not in the wrong here."}
{"text":"Came once and had amazing pasta dish. It really was to die for. Alas I can't remember what it was so I guess I'll have to eat my way thru their menu til I find it.  It's a tough job but somebody has to so it"}
{"text":"Wonderful meal and great atmosphere!  I had spinach/ricotta tortelloni which was fabulous!  Caesar salads were great.  Service was wonderful, friendly and attentive. Great atmosphere and a great place to eat outside on a nice night!"}
{"text":"Great Restaurant Week menu.  Proscuitto wrapped pork was perfect and creative cocktails to top off the evening."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but the Happy Hour menu was very limited...probably the shortest list I have seen by far. The Sangria was all right...could be better. Bruchetta was really amazing though! Will most likely give it another chance, either for lunch or dinner next time."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for a work lunch with a group of 7. They were great about accommodating us and our table was perfect. I've been to the North in Kierland commons and this one definitely outdoes that location. The seating is gorgeous - very open and airy and I love the natural light. Seems like a cute spot for a date night or a girls dinner and drinks night. Their patio looks super cute but with it being deathly hot in Phoenix right now I'll have to wait to try it.   I ordered a chicken caesar salad which was good for a plain salad - I wasn't expecting much and was trying to stick to my healthy eating plan. My coworker ordered a pizza that I have literally been dreaming about ever since. It looked amazing - its currently on my must try list. Dessert was very good - ordered the salted caramel budino which was amazeballs - totally worth the extra time at the gym. Will definitely be returning when I can indulge a little bit more."}
{"text":"I just spent a month evaluating restaurants in the Phoenix area and this is my absolute favorite. It is the only place I ate more than once. In fact, I ate here with my wife four times. It's that good and it's that cool. The service is very professional (including the hostess even when it's really busy), the atmosphere is fun, and the food is very, very good. What more do i need to say? Oh yeah, there's valet."}
{"text":"Ummmm yeah.... This place is legit.  Clean country feel.  Atmosphere is always positive and inviting.  You can come with your friends or go solo.  Staff is very friendly.  I am in love with the spaghetti and meatballs.  When ordering this dish I recommend that you ask for the meatballs to be cooked medium as these guys can easily come over cooked.  Other than that you are gonna love the entire menu.  I haven't had anything I don't like."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Atmosphere! Check out this post about North!  http://stephangcalizona.wordpress.com/2012/10/13/north-fattoria-italiana/"}
{"text":"Really great food and atmosphere. I love the cocktails here. You can't go wrong with any of the food. I think it is a little pricey for what you get and it's always crowded, but all around, you won't be mad you ate and/or drank here."}
{"text":"Been here several times for dinner and drinks... Food is great, atmosphere is even better. Even more so now that they added the \"North bar/lounge\"   Went here today for lunch, the place was very busy but they managed to find us a table quickly. I ordered the Angus burger which was very good! The service was as well.   The reason I love this place is because it's not defined as being a \"happy hour\" spot or \"lunch\" spot... North is a great spot for a quick drink, long lunch or an intimate dinner. It is a well rounded spot for any occasion and I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a large party on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.  The decor was nice and we were seated at a huge beautiful wooden table that I would love to have in my own home.  Here's a list of things we tried:  1) Complimentary bread: stale and dry. Not worth the calories! - 1 star 2) zucchini chips: surprisingly delicious. Paper thin zucchini freshly deep fried sprinkled with salt and parsley.  It tasted like fresh potato chips, but brighter and yummier! - 5 stars 3) calamari with arugula: rubbery and chewy, but the flavor was decent. - 3 stars 4) Tuscan tomato soup: rich and flavorful. this was the best tomato soup i've ever had! - 5 stars 5) mushroom and arugula pizza and the margarita pizza - soggy in the center, but the flavors were good and it had a crispy, chewy crust. I had to transfer the cheese and toppings to the edge of the pizza and discarded the center. - 3 stars 6) sausage pasta (I forget the name of it): too salty for my taste, but the flavor was bold and yummy. Plus, I'm a sucker for homemade pasta which was somewhat shaped like shells and had a consistency of spaetzle. It would have been great if they cut back on the salt a bit. - 3 stars Sangria: sweet, fruity, and soft on the alcohol - just the way I like it. Not the best i've ever had, but still really delicious!   The service was excellent and it was a nice experience.  Overall, I would give this place 3.5 stars but yelp's rating system does not allow us to rate in fractions, so I rounded up."}
{"text":"I loved the original NoRTH is Scottsdale so I am thrilled to have this one in the neighborhood. I'm working my way through the menu and love it all so far!! Can't go wrong here. The general manager, Derik, makes each visit special. FRC made a good decision moving him to the new location. I'm sure many people are trying NoRTH at Arcadia because they know him. Great, great place!"}
{"text":"Our first trip to North and we couldn't have been more pleased. The service was excellent and the food was unbelievable. We will definitely return to this place again"}
{"text":"Bruschetta was good and the Mahi Mahi was delicious. Very noisy and hard to hear. Not a quiet date place."}
{"text":"It's one of my top places to go for happy hour with $4 glasses of wine and $5 bowls of buccatini and meatballs! Great italian food and excellent patio (although the chairs could be a little more comfy) nestled into a bustling neighborhood of great restaurants. The staff is always super friendly with top notch service which is really important. The food is always excellent but if my car keeps getting parked in the back to make room for BMWs at the front, I'll head on down the street to LGO. They don't have enough parking space to be car snobs."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and fast on a weekday night at 7:30 p.m.  Pizza burratta was thin, crispy and tasty!  Somewhat limited food menu with antipasto, salads, and pizzas.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars rating  I was excited to try North, and by reading other reviews on Yelp, I knew what to avoid.  We arrived on a Friday at about 6PM, just under the wire to order a few drinks and an appetizer from the happy hour menu.  The wine recommendation was great and the bruschetta with crescenza cheese, asparagus, prosciutto di Parma was very good.  The bruschetta melted in our mouths.  The only thing that could have made the bruschetta better would have been a little acid on the asparagus, maybe a little lemon.    I ordered the short rib \"osso buco\" with polenta and root vegetables.  Now I knew it wasn't real osso buco going in, but that didn't matter because it was fabulous.  The polenta was so creamy and delicious.  Some of the root vegetables were a little carmelized, which made them sweet and yummy.  There was also braised kale which was very good and not bitter at all.  Overall, a very good dish that I recommend and would order again.    My husband's dish is why I gave a 3.5 star rating.  He ordered the baked ziti bolognese with spinach, ricotta and mozzarella cheese.  My husband asked for sausage to be added to the dish and also asked if they could spice it up a little, like add an arrabiata sauce.  The waiter said it would be no problem.  We both figured they would add some dried peperoncino (italian red pepper flakes).  Instead they added fresh sliced jalapeno.  Are you kidding me?  Jalapenos in italian food?  It seemed very strange.  The sausage was also extremely dry.  We realized that the dish would have been better as is, so it may be partly our fault.  But the problem is that the waiters at North constantly try to upsell you by suggesting that you make additions to the dishes.  I noticed that at other tables and in past reviews on yelp.  They suggest that you add chicken, shrimp, etc.  The dishes shouldn't need additions, they should stand up on their own.    In conclusion, the food was good, service nice, but I won't stray from the menu, and I'll go in knowing that the waiter will probably try to up-sell me."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner at North tonite, party of 7.  We got there before the dinner rush, so plenty of open seating in the restaurant.  Despite that, the service was slow and somewhat inattentive.  I've eaten at many Fox restaurants and this is the first one that really disappointed me from a service standpoint.  Once the food arrived, it was great.  But we waited much too long and wondered if we were invisible.  I'll give it another try, but with built in skepticism."}
{"text":"Went with a friend early on a Sat. (6pm) for dinner.  I'm glad we went a little early because the place filled up fast.  Wait staff/service:  Welcomed by a staff member actually opening the door for me (nice touch).  Promptly seated.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable of the wine list and menu.  The waitress was also perfect in her timing...checked in enough to make sure we were happy, but not too much as to make you feel rushed.  Food/Drinks:  My friend had the house Pinot Grigio and I had a Negroni Nuovo (these things could be dangerous...a great drink for a summer day).  We split Antipasti (bread & cheese...this was yummy, although the name could be improved) and Insalate (Italian...also a boring menu name, but was tasty as well).  We both had pasta for our main course...Tagliatelle and Ricotta Gnocchi.  Both of us thought the pasta was delicious...perfectly cooked and very flavorful.  Dessert:  We split the Salted Carmel Budino.  It was so good, I almost ordered one to go.  Rich as Budino should be, but light enough so as not to put you in an after dinner coma.  Price:  If you want to try the traditional multi-course Italian meal, the prices can add up.  Our meal for 2 came to ~$110 (including 1 drink each and the tip).  For a casual dining atmosphere, some may consider this too pricey.  Other comments:  I read other comments about a problem with flies.  This must have been overcome, because we didn't notice any.  This is a restaurant I will visit again to sample some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"My party arrived at 8:30pm on Wednesday, we sat down at the bar and we were IMMEDIATELY greeted.  Within 12 minutes we had drinks and food and with 20 minutes we had our entrees.  The service \"team\" could not have been more pleasant.  What a juxtaposition from Zinc Bistro, just 100 ft down the way.  Thank you North for saving our evening."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Can't wait to go back again! Pasta was so good! Grilled artichokes hands down the best in town! We have been here numerous times and each time I try something different. Never disappoints!"}
{"text":"First time here visiting Scottsdale and so many restaurants to choose from at the commons.  I definitely picked the wrong one!  Food was ok not great. We shared three salads and all three tasted the same !  Atmosphere was beautiful...outside dining!  Our server was just awful!  She should not be dealing with the public.  I realize everyone has bad days but she really should have stayed home, instead her attitude put downer on a beautiful day out with my sisters.  Management should take note!' I am a person that never complains but I just couldn't help myself this time.  Sorry"}
{"text":"We walked by this place while shopping and decided to have dinner there. The food was fantastic. I had the lasagna and my wife had a penne pasta dish. Both were very good. The wait staff was absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"Everything including the food, service, and atmosphere was incredible! Stephanie was our server and she could not have been any better at her job. Although I am sure all the staff are fantastic, I would highly suggest sitting with her if she is there.   I would recommend everything that we had (caesar, eggplant pizza, chicken parmesan) but most of all focus on the dessert paired with an outstandingly foamy latte. Make sure you try the roasted banana crepes... out of this world!"}
{"text":"Our first experience this morning at North for brunch was luscious! Excellent food and delightful patio made for a wonderfully relaxing lazy Saturday morning here in Phoenix. Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Best \"date\" restaurant in Glendale. Although this is a chain, it isn't cheesy and for Glendale it's prob the classiest joint in town. The zuccha chips are great.  Very thin, flash fried zuchinni chips. The bruschetta is fun to share and is a not-too light not-too heavy app to start with.   J and I had the scallops with orzo which was tasty. I usually don't like to get the same dish as a friend so we can try diff. things, but we both felt like scallops that evening. P had the strozzepretti (twisty pasta)  with cream and mushrooms. As picky as he is, he enjoyed it.  I like their wine list, not too long and with a few reasonably-priced bottles.  We were in rush so didn't have dessert.  ****************************************************************** Dec 1, 2006  Brought R here for dinner. We haven't had a proper dinner date yet, so wanted to take him to a place that had cloth napkins.   We shared the zucca chips (I can't NOT order these). I got the pork chop with spinach and broccolini. R got the fish special which was scallop wrapped in salmon wrapped in bacon with white beans and veggies. Sounds weird, huh? The scallop and salmon combo was good, but felt the saltiness of the bacon confused things.   We shared the chocolate and peanut butter tort which was dense and delicious--also topped with vanilla bean gelato. R ordered it, had maybe 3 bites and was done leaving me to finish it. How evil. But so good.  A note: North does not really change up the menu, I've been here a few times this past year and it's the same stuff, only the soup and daily special changes. Helloooo....while its good, it can get predictable."}
{"text":"Get to North on 40th street at least once a week, sometime more. Each meal over the years have always been right on. Food - quality, portions, and most importantly, taste is always great. Service - staff is always personable and upbeat, professional/efficient friendly. Managers - are visible and welcoming, making sure the momentum between the kitchen and the servers are running smoothly.  Bar - friendly, attentive, and great attitude."}
{"text":"Not the greatest tonight - and we usually hit it out of the park on Sunday's.  The pizza of the day was Salami - not our favorite.  The zucca chips were a bit soggy and could have used more salt.  The best was when our server took away our wine glasses BEFORE we even had a chance to order drinks - really RUDE!!!  For fans of the Big Bang Theory you can have a server who is a dead ringer for one of the cast, and NO it's not Sheldon."}
{"text":"This restaurant was delightful. If it was a drink it would be a sunny delight. Don't try to get here by driving south though. Or east. Or west. One guy that works there has a really great beard. Another girl that works there has a charming smile. If you want to be served by nice beards and charming smiles, well there's no better place."}
{"text":"As great as we remembered it. Had the arancini appetizer at the recommendation of the General Manager who visited our table, and it did not disappoint--thank you! For main course, had my favorite--seared scallops in risotto--and it (again) delivered. Had been easily a year since we'd eaten there, so really great to see they hadn't missed a beat. Will definitely visit again (sooner this time)."}
{"text":"Well, it has a long fancy name, but I just call it North. Or is it NoRTH?  Anyway, it's an airy barn of a building with a delicious door-to-bar-to-patio layout. Oh, and there's a restaurant with seating and stuff too. But you have to turn left for that.  Thank goodness for the valet. Like Chelsea's, it's nice if you can score a spot early, but let them help you otherwise!  Maybe skip the white sangria - it was made to order and lacked the depth of a proper sangria, but wasn't potent enough to call a cocktail. Luckily, the other house cocktails are worth writing home about, some even come with an exotic floral garnish.  The salad was enough to share between two, but we should have then shared a pasta dish or gone for the cheese plate. The pizza we ordered was bland, the crust uninspired, but I might try it again anyway... with my own reorganizing of the toppings, perhaps?!  The staff is attentive, and knowledgeable. The decor to menu is a comfortable match (not always the strongest point of a Fox concept). And the crowd is pleasantly neighborhoody and good for people watching."}
{"text":"Fantastic! And, great service! Went for Sunday brunch nice variety of menu selections for all people in your party! Nice open atmosphere."}
{"text":"3/31/11: delicious pasta with butternut squash & brussel sprouts! Excellent service - I appreciate it when my server checks table without being obtrusive. And, it's a Pepsi place! :)"}
{"text":"Fancy Italian place. The pizza was good but not amazing. The salad was good and they even split it for us. Unfortunately, the split was not even and one plate got all the goodies and the other plate got mostly just greens. Good beer selection. The service was fine. There was an issue with our order- well over 45 minute wait- so we got free drinks. They were very apologetic. We sat outside which was lovely. The inside was a bit noisy. I had the spaghetti bolognese and was very pleased. Great pasta and delicious sauce. Of course its worth going to just for the dessert, especially the salted carmel budino. Wow."}
{"text":"Good ambiance. looks small on initial entry but its cozy once you're seated. Great service with good attention. A bunch of us ordered the scallops.....Ranks up there with the best scallops I've ever had. Wine list could be better, but we went with one of the california cabs, which wasn't too bad, looked for a malbec but only a 2010 on the list...(wow, I sounded like I know wines like the back of my hand...for a second there didn't I....)..anyway.  All in all. Great service. The food was outstanding. We ordered desert too. Man....talk about delicious."}
{"text":"Had a 25% discount and a birthday free dessert.  The place is very, very noisy.  We were seated immediately and not having been there in a very long time, I noticed the menu was completely different.  I ordered a pizza (normally I eat salmon).  It was OK but I gave half to my husband.  For the free dessert there was nothing CHOCOLATE. I got Nutella gelato and gave it to my husband.  A discount and free dessert (of which there was none for my taste) was not worth it.  Will not return.  It is \"not what it once was.\"  Give it a MISS, in my opinion."}
{"text":"This is a bustling, lively, trendy place to have dinner.  We have been here a couple of times and the food is amazing.  Went as part of restaurant week and the bruschetta was great, the chicken parmesan was too big for me to finish and delicious and the tiramisu was simply amazing.  The servers here are attentive, kind, and are quite knowledgeable about their wine list and are always ready to suggest something.  If we lived closer we would be here more frequently, but for now we will have to settle for periodic Fridays and Saturdays here and there."}
{"text":"Went here 3 times in 2 weeks while in town on business! Great food and interesting atmosphere! Very trendy! Valet parking. If I'm back in town, will definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"This place is great!!! Outdoor seating, intelligent waitstaff and amazing chefs. Literally the best pizza I have ever had. I have eaten pizza in over 10 countries and this one tops the list. After a day of shopping in Scottsdale this is an amazing place for a romantic dinner!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm, this place sure reminds me of True Food Kitchen....why is that?  Could there be some common denominator?  I guess it is different in that it's smaller...and the food is actually good!  Anyways, nothing about the menu would lead me to believe it's an Italian restaurant but I primarily dine here for lunch and maybe they switch to heartier fare for dinner service.  I've had the flank steak 3 times straight which used to come with Kale (excellent) but was recently switched to an arugula and baby beet salad (why did they have to die so young?!) which is even better.  The place has a nice vibe, is adjacent to BarNorth and everything else Kierland has to offer but it is almost always LOUD.  My only other issue is the small tables and tight seating arrangements.  Don't expect a whole lot of privacy if it's busy b/c the other patrons might as well be on your lap.  Overall though, North is a cool place, good food, good service, and if you order an Arnold Palmer you get the lemonade in a nice little carafe--stay classy North...stay classy."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here at North. The service is always top rate. You must not leave without getting a side of creamy polenta. No seriously, get the polenta! Zucca chips, sweet+savory spaghetti & meatballs, chef's board... So simple but so well executed. I love North."}
{"text":"I'm here from out of town and tried NoRTH based on previous reviews. We weren't disappointed. The sundried tomato butter that came with the complimentary bread was mildly flavored. We decided to share a few items so started with the bruschetta which was really good and unlike any I've had with soft cheese and prosciutto. Second was the chopped salad - lots of gorgonzola but could have used a bit more dressing. Entree was the cavetelli with sausage, tomatoes and kale in a 'pink' sauce. The sausage had great flavor and the overall dish was really tasty. I thought it was a nice touch that they split the dishes for us prior to bringing them to the table. I would definitely return here to try some of the other dishes and dessert."}
{"text":"Review update for their updated pasta selections! They are great!! So far my favorite is the Chitarra (shrimp, brussels sprouts, butternut squash and a hint of hazelnut), yummmmm~ also had the chance to try the Tagliatelle and Cavatelli, both were very flavorful, meat-lovers would love the Tagliatelle!"}
{"text":"My 10 Year Wedding Anniversary rolls around, so I solicited suggestions from friends. I gave my husband a choice of 3 restaurants. Out of all the suggestions, he chose North Italia in Kierland. Described as Italian with an American twist, after eating there I wish they kept the American twist out.    It is very hard to give a high level overview, but I will. The menu and food are nothing to flip over. I have literally eaten much better meals at Carrabas and Maggianos up the street for a fraction of the price. What was great? The service (besides the 15 minutes it took to acknowledge us at our table in an almost empty restaurant), the drinks, and the dessert (I'll get to that later) were excellent and you could tell the meats and vegetables were the freshest of the fresh...that's about it.   So now to specifics. We had the meat plate as an appetizer. It was good, nothing special. I had been to a conference the day before at a Scottsdale hotel and they had the same exact meats, cheeses, olives etc at the buffet. Of course, NI's meats and cheeses were fresher but all in all tasted the same. The meat platter at Pig & Pickle blows this one away. Next up Cesar Salad. They forgot the dressing on mine, so once I did get it....it was ok nothing special.    Now we get to the final course, I was debating with myself since the moment we got there whether to get the Spicy Shrimp pasta or the Short ribs over fresh veggies, I go with the spicy shrimp.  The ingredients looked delectable, white wine sauce, fresh shrimp, chili flakes....yummy....NOT. It didn't taste bad at all because there was NO TASTE TO IT WHAT SO EVER. I didn't want to complain so when the really nice waiter came over to ask how it was, I just said \"its ok can I get some parmesan?,\" so I could potentially salvage this meal by drowning it with parmesan, which I never do. A few minutes later the manager came over and explained that OK was not good enough for them and insisted I get something else. I picked my second choice the braised short rib. I have to say it was really really good. You can cut it with a fork. I stop shy of saying excellent because, it tastes like my pot roast that I throw in a slow cooker for 10 hours (North Italia cooks theirs for 25 hours in a slow cooker...I asked) and then throws some au jus on it.  Tasted Great! But nothing special.   Now Dessert. My husband and I are not dessert people but since it was a special day, we decided to go for it. Glad we did. We ordered a caramel salted dessert, I forgot what they call it. It is the first item on the dessert menu. It was unique, interesting, creative, and tasted great! If every other item we had was this unique and good, the entire experience would have been amazing.   Bottom line-After reading this you may think I'm high maintenance. When it comes to food I am anything but. However, I have expectations. Especially when your bill comes to $200.  Unlike the other Fox Restaurant I've tried, True Foods, which is disgusting and I don't get any of the raving about it, I would give North Italia another chance. Not in the near future, because there is too many other restaurants I need to try out."}
{"text":"Went to North with my family of 11, including the under 7 crowd. We had a good table near the kitchen, so the kids (and adults) could watch the pasta being made. Everything I tasted was really good, including: o Raviolini, pork with lemon preserves tastes so fresh. o Tortelinni o roast pork o beet salad, also,with a hint of lemon o short ribs w/ gnocchi  Save room for dessert! The budino, salted caramel and bombolini (essentially donuts) we're fabulous. The wait staff was very attentive and good. The ambience was modern and not pretentious, with a good mix of families and others. Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food pretty good value for money. Wine menu overpriced. Worth a visit on Sunday with half price wine."}
{"text":"Our second time dining here... First time was excellent and went back searching for that great experience once more. But it didn't quite work out.  We had reservations, however when we arrived, our table wasn't available so we sat at the bar. After 30 minutes we checked back with the hostess and they claimed they 'looked everywhere' but also said 'I forgot you were at the bar.'  No biggie since we weren't in a hurry, but definitely something in the servics the restaurant can improve upon.   And then dinner... I mentioned to our server that I couldn't have cheese, and I ordered the Strozzapreti prepared the exact same way as in my first visit where they replaced the parmesan cream with a delicious olive oil and garlic sauce. To our group's surprise, it came out with the creamiest, cheesiest, parmesan cream. My husband asked our waitress to confirm it had no cheese and she said it may taste cheesy but had no cheese. Seriously?   We both tasted it..and fortunately I was able to swap dishes with my husband since we both agreed I couldn't have this dish -super cheesy, the aged parmesan was definetly present.  Sad to see that our experience was tainted and our favorite spot with great ambiance,  has fallen off our list because of a non-caring staff member that didn't even offer to prepare a new dish. Sad all around.  Even if the food is great, if they aren't able to cater to customer's needs, then it's a place we can't go to."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today.  The food seemed pricey.  I had the mushroom pizza for $14 which was OK, there were 2 pieces left and neither I or my guest took it home.  The Italian salad was very good but a bit pricey for $12.  We had coffee and it was so weak we could not drink it.  The service was good but I don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"Amazing meal. The menu is small, but executed to perfection. I recommend going \"family style\" and sharing the diversity of the entrees. Jodie (sp?) was one of the best waitresses I've had in years with an unwavering smile and big energy and even went above and beyond and helped us with coordinating a shuttle to get home. Well done."}
{"text":"My husbands boss recommended that we try this place so we did! We ordered the garlic bread truffle (to die for), and meatballs for appetizers, both where really good! We split the chicken parmigiana and it was also delicious. The atmosphere was really fun and not to loud where you couldn't hold a conversation. The wait staff was very helpful and courtesy and always kept our drinks full."}
{"text":"Excellent rating for atmosphere, service quality and delicious flavors.   Would give 5 stars except that the portions are pretty small!   Overall kudos to this new neighborhood gem.  The bar looks like a fun vibe to grab a beverage & a bite.  Very easy wait because they provide texting service and there are nice shops to browse.  We tried the short rib pasta...excellent, the farm salad and tortellini!   We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Awesome.  This italian joint has an awesome atmosphere with the brick walls, open kitchen, and dim lighting. Some people might call it a bit loud (and maybe to the older crowd it is), but I was totally digging the hustle and bustle of it all. We were seated before our reservation time, had an awesome waitress, and the food came out within 10 minutes.  The bruschetta might be some of my new favorite. And the angel hair pasta was killer. It seems like the really know how to keep it light (most italian places drown their pasta in sauce). For the area, the price isn't bad. About 15 bucks an entree.  One criticism. The tables are REALLY close together. I don't really mind that, but I would understand that some would."}
{"text":"I met a g/f here for Happy Hour.  We had their Simple salad and Patata pizza.  Both were just ok.  The food was ok.  The service was ok.  Everything about this place was just ok.  I don't feel a burning desire to go back."}
{"text":"A must try! My boyfriend and I come here all the time. We are never let down the food is amazing and the service is great. There is always great happy hour specials. Everything is at a reasonable price. I strongly recommend giving this place a try you will not be let down. Enjoy :)!"}
{"text":"While visiting the Scottsdale area we decided to check out Kierland commons for a dinner spot. After reading a few yelp reviews I decided to give North a try. We were seated in the bar area towards the back of the establishment. Our server was attentive and the food was incredible. We started with the garlic bread with fresh ricotta and truffle oil - holy wow was that worth the calories! The tortelloni was also amazing, and the drinks were unique! The only reason my review got 4 stars was due to the extremely loud atmosphere compliments of a large group of high school girls. I will definitely come back here the next time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Come here on a Sunday! Happy hour menu applies all day plus half priced bottles of every wine on the menu. We got a board to start, which had very generous portions and was quite delicious. Had the pizza special (eggplant) and the tiramisu for dessert. Plus the service was very knowledgeable and attentive. Absolutely best combination of quality food, ambiance, and price!"}
{"text":"It's almost a 5 stars.. but the service need to be review. Our waitress wasn't paying attention to us, but all the others employees took care of us. I went there today with my brother for a brunch. We took the Chef board and the daily bruchettas and couple of glasses of wine. The presentation of the food is really nice and the taste as well (I love there abricots mustard! ). Since the summer is here we were able to eat outside with there beautiful patio. We will be back and we hope the service will be better."}
{"text":"These are the pizzas I received Friday night (November 3rd). The first pizza was the chefs special which had brussels sprouts, pistachios, parmesan cheese, and chili oil. The second pizza was the prosciutto.   My concern with this restaurant (this was my first time eating there) is quality control. The pizzas were served burnt, cold, and their presentation was messy.   The chefs special did not have enough thought put into the dish as the chili oil overwhelmed the dish as you couldn't taste any of the other ingredients due to the spiciness.  Finally, the proofing / preparation of pizza dough needs some more fine tuning as the dough was tasteless but paired with a relentless chewiness.   The pizzas were so bad I had to get pizza at another restaurant."}
{"text":"We have been to the Arcadia North which was a great experience..going to Kierland this Saturday..hope this location lives up to my expectations as a 5 star"}
{"text":"Aside from being a little loud, the staff was great and the food was even better! The zucca chips were a great appetizer for the whole table. Kale salad was delicious and I had the Prosciutto pizza- awesome as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was so annoyed by the fact you can reserve a table through Open Table and when we got to the restaurant they said that happens a lot, but we don't take reservations that way, sorry. WHAH? Then fix it! In this day and age, people don't need to be confused with how to get seated at the restaurant. The food was good, but come on."}
{"text":"Four stars because the service in the beginning was less than par. It began to get better as the evening went on. The boards for an appetizer is great and I absolutely loved my dinner of the bolganese. Prices are a little high for the portion size but it's fresh, real food, and good company. Will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! Their chef is really thinking out of the box. It doesn't matter whether you have brunch or dinner, you will have great food and great service! The flavors are fantastic! If there was ever a time to step out of your comfort zone and try something new, this is it! Go with a group and eat family style. Try it all! YUM!"}
{"text":"Another favorite in my BF's neighborhood.  I've only been to the Bar NoRTH location.  Great place to just sit outside on a gorgeous day, sip cocktails, eat appetizers and chat.   I have not made it past pizza and cocktails but the limited exposure i've had to the food/cocktails/people/service/location - all excellent."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Sat at the bar and had a great time with the bartender, and great service. I was not able to find anything on the menu, so he was able to put something together for me! I got a bowl of cheese stuffed tortellini with chicken and alfredo sauce and it was the best pasta dish I have had in a long time. My husband was just as happy with his chicken parm dish, his dish and servicing size was HUGE! We will definitely be back for pasta nights!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with bRUNch Running Group Phoenix for their Kick off in Pheonix.  Shared the French Toast (OMG!) and the Beef Rib Hash (Yum!) with my running partner.  She had the Peach Bellinni (sp?) and i had the Red Rooster (Bloody Mary). I wasn't a Bloody Mary fan until I had the Red Rooster very tasty, spicy and delish! The food was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Place is always good. I had the artichoke heart appetizer and it was quite tasty. Wine is expensive, as is the food, if you don't go during happy hour. But it's one of my preferred places to go to and people watch as I work on my books. Kelly was a great server, very attentive to providing quality wait service. This place consistently provides good food and service."}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent.  The atmosphere very cool.  Noise level was an issue, but I should have known that having read some of the other reviews.  It is hard to have conversation once the place fills up, but then we were also so busy eating sumptuous food."}
{"text":"Favorites:  Spaghetti and meatballs. Simplicity done so well it's amazing. I love the use bucatini - there's something about eating spaghetti-shaped tubes of pasta that makes my meal more exciting, especially when they cook it perfectly to al dente. The sauce is flavorful, fresh with basil, and cheesy but not excessively so. Meatballs are full of flavor. I'd order this many times over again.   Scallops. I'm not a huge fan of scallops in general, but this dish definitely changes my mind!  Zucca chips. They're super thinly sliced, not very crisp, but fun to eat and share with the table.   All the salads. I've tried the kale salad and the seasonal vegetable salad, and both are refreshing, flavorful, and not heavy at all. I love the nuts.   Nutella trifle. Need I say more?  Service: Very friendly and classy, but not overly so in a way that makes you feel like I'm in a super fancy restaurant. My dad did not like his sea bass very much (a bit fishy for his taste) and our waiter Steve offered to replace his dish or bring him soup or anything of his choice. Even though my dad declined as there was a lot of food to go around, our waiter insisted that we at least get a free dessert. Very friendly staff overall."}
{"text":"I just had lunch at Sam Fox new North on 40th street! What a great addition to the Arcadia neighborhood. As always the building and atmosphere was great! The food was fantastic! I didn't think I could eat Italian food 4 days a week! But I am gonna try. Once again Sam you NAILED it!"}
{"text":"Service - GREAT Food - GREAT  Always a delightful time here. We ordered a pasta dish to share, and they were kind enough to split the portions for us. The arancini balls are amazing!"}
{"text":"its a good place but not mind blowing. great ambiance, solid menu, and great service. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! The waiters are fenomenal and make you feel like home! In special Paulina ho I love her attention and attitude!!!! So the food OMG amazing true Italy!!!"}
{"text":"great 'Bottle & Board\" happy hour deal, you get either a bottle of house red or white wine, or sangria (their sangria is very good) and you also get to choose between a flatbread pizza or bruschetta. Good atmosphere, good food. Also....they have a great Affogato!"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place.  It was fun, vibrant and hip and the food was pretty good.  The calamari salad with arugula was da bomb and still is.  The food was definitely better when it first opened.    If you drink enough alcohol to ignore the miserable wait staff then it's not so bad.  The wait staff are unprofessional and could give 2 rats about your dining experience; but all you have to do is tip accordingly and hopefully they'll shape up.  There are way too many places in Scottsdale to return here.  I think I will give it one more shot.  It is a shame b/c the food is pretty decent."}
{"text":"We always have great food and service here. My favorite is the short rib gnocchi or the spaghetti. It's a cool atmosphere. It's kind of pricey so it's just an occasional dinner place for us."}
{"text":"I love sushi! And this is the best place to go in Phoenix! The waitresses are beautiful and fun and friendly!"}
{"text":"I loved my first experience here on a date. I had THE most delicious lasagna ever! Came back last night with family and to my dismay, they had taken it off of the menu :( I still enjoyed my salad and Bolognese but will not be coming back as often."}
{"text":"Happy Hour = winning! Maybe, it was the great friendly service, $4 local brews, or the great menu for happy hour prices! Either way, winner winner chicken dinner.   They make their own bread, pasta, dough. And it is fantastic!   Cheese pizza $8 Meat & cheese board $10  Zucca Chips $3 { MUST TRY }"}
{"text":"Omg Wes gave us amazing service .. He suggested great appetizers and the most delicious meals ..   Wes was a absolute pleasure. I will be dining here again and hope to be seated with Wes . This is a must place to enjoy a beautiful meal in a fabulous location .."}
{"text":"We love North Italia! Delicious food, unique drink menu, timely and hot food, great wait staff, and great ambiance. No wonder the place is always a packed house! I would recommend making reservations each time you dine here."}
{"text":"Great layout, ambiance, and food! Fig and prosciutto pizza is the perfect amount of sweet and savory. The chocolate tart for dessert was decadent."}
{"text":"The service here was atrocious. When the food came it was not hot and the only excuse they gave was that they were busy. We normally like it here and have not had this experience in the past. I do not think we will be returning."}
{"text":"North is probably one of my favorite restaurants!! Their truffle garlic bread is amazing and they have great pastas and pizzas!! Their salted caramel budino is phenomenal, it is super creamy and the flavors work so well!! And the location is amazing, Keirland is always fun to be in!"}
{"text":"Love the beautiful decor and atmosphere--I've gotten the beet salad which was delish, but my favorite thing ever is the spinach tortellino--oh my goodness, it's amazing! My hubby gets the lasagna or the spagetti and meatballs, both were divine. We love to go here for special occasions :)"}
{"text":"Wet, moist and damp. The patio offered almost an African Rain Forrest feel but the pasta and salad delivered. Great food."}
{"text":"I hate leaving bad reviews for restaurants that I have only visited once but this place was terrible. And I LOVE fox restaurants. This was just not up to their standards. We ended up going on New Years Day and that was probably our biggest problem because it seems the waitress was hung over from the previous night. Our drinks we served promptly (by another server) but that were it ended. We ordered bread for the table because we wanted something to eat while they made our food. She forgot and she was no where to be found. 30 min break? Not sure. She finally surfaced and we reminded her and she brought it a few minutes before our dinner. Not what we had in mind. Our pizzas were brought ( by another server) and they were delicious. Again, she never reappeared to ask us how,it was, if we needed anything else or anything. She disappeared for about an hour. I seriously thought she had left for the day and forgot to tell us but she did make it back to hand us the check but we lost her soon after that. We finally had to find another waitress to pay and left. Don't think We will be back. WHile the food is good, there are too many good restaurants in the area that have better service."}
{"text":"Pretty good Americanized Italian foods like their pizzas, pastas, and boards. Great atmosphere but lacks consistency in staffing, food quality, and guest services. There is also no guest parking, only valet which is an inconvenience to most. It's just another basic Fox restaurant, good but not great."}
{"text":"Went here with some good friends on a busy Saturday night. Very energetic vibe, great food, and even better service. Gianna is the best. We will definitely be back and will ask for her when we return."}
{"text":"I have gone to this North many many times before because I live close to the restaurant. For the most part, I am very happy and pleased with the service and the food. Unfortunately tonight was absolutely a mess. Not only were we seated at the table right in font of the entrance, but the pizzas that came out were not what my cousin and I ordered. So not only was I served a pizza that I couldn't eat, but when the pizza I ordered finally arrived, an hour and a half later, it was completely burnt. 1 or 2 pieces were edible but even those pieces were masked with a crunchy burnt taste. I was left eating the practically nonexistent toppings. My other disappointment was the waiter. While he was seemed friendly, I had a continuous feeling that we were at the very end of his attention span. The only time that we saw him was when he was bringing our food and taking it away. The only person who checked up on us the entire 2 and a half hours we were there was the manager when they informed us the first time that we would not be getting the pizzas we ordered because there was a mix up. I did appreciate when our waiter asked if I would like another pizza after I mentioned how burnt my second pizza was, but I was tired of waiting and just wanted to leave the restaurant. I think one of the biggest issues I had with the night is that I, in particular, spent 75% of the time with my food untouched and sitting in front of me, and not one of the waiters or managers took notice. If I was a waiter who saw that someone hasn't touched their food, I would ask immediately if something was wrong. Maybe if my waiter has done that, I would have been able to order something else and not have to leave the restaurant hungrier than when I arrived. I have loved North for years and I am always happy to go there for a special occasion, but this time was extremely disappointing. For how much they charge for their food and for the level of dining experience that they have shown to have, they really missed the mark tonight. Honestly, if it wasn't for the Olympics playing in the corner, I don't think I would've made it through the night."}
{"text":"Visited this place for lunch during the week.  I had the Spinach Tortellini my sister had the one of the salads but I cannot recall which one.  She did let me try it and it was pretty good.  My tortellini was very good but the servings are not very big.  Very open atmosphere, not too packed.  I would like to give it another go for dinner."}
{"text":"Just when you think you know everything there is to know about this Fox restaurant, you end up being dazzled!  We've been many times and thought we knew what to expect.  Wrong!  The service was outstanding and the food just sublime.  Yes, this is North that we're talking about.  If you can request Jodi, then you'll be treated to staff with consummate knowledge about the menu and ingredients.  She is delightful and a tremendous asset to this popular restaurant group.  And the food was just SUPERB!  We began with the proverbial zucca chips and a kale salad that was the BEST kale salad on any restaurant menu!  The vinaigrette was terrific and there was just enough 'crunch' in the kale.  The patata pizza was an epicurean delight!  Pizza dough that was pure perfection!  Cheese and tomatoes that had a faint hint of fennel with aromas designed to make your mouth water.  The strozzapreti pasta with chicken, roasted mushrooms, Bloomsdale spinach, toasted pine nuts, and parmesan creme far surpassed our expectations.  Great texture, great flavor; would order again in a heartbeat.  The salted caramel boutini provided that appropriate topping of a delectable evening and is large enough for two to share.  Additional wait staff ensured that water glasses and wine were always full.  If this is consistent than North Arcadia is comparable to the best restaurants on the east coast and is working diligently at becoming one of the nation's premier restaurants.  You don't have to dress to impress, but casual elegance is in abundance."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!!  If you like your pasta dishes with 1 pound of butter and olive oil in it.  For some strange reason, I do not.  So, I say this place sucks!  I did give it two stars because of the great service and decent ambiance.  However, out of the three pasta dishes we had, the only thing that was mediocre was the Lasagna.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Took the family for dinner Sunday night and it was great! Calamari was cooked perfectly, branzino and chicken were very good, the place was busy and they have 50% off bottles of wine which we took advantage of of course."}
{"text":"This review is based upon customer service only as we were unable to eat because we never got served. The hostess stated that the wait time was 35 minutes for outside sitting for a party of two .  We looked outside and there were six tables for two empty and set for customers, and two tables for a party of four or more that were also empty!   We decided to seat ourselves and received a hello for a server and nothing more.   After watching another table getting water we waited another 15 minutes and left.  There is no excuses for this mismanagement and poor customer service, especially on a Saturday night at 7:30pm  There are so many other excellent restaurants in this area, try them as they will work for your business harder than this.   Note to restaurant management: really, 35 minute wait when you have at least six tables open?  One would think you do not want to make a profit or maybe your staff is lazy.  Which is it?"}
{"text":"Update to my previous review:  North is once again a favorite that I find myself frequently much too often. Excellent management, friendly (and dare I say very attractive) bar staff, delicious new drink offerings, and the free WiFi I've always loved. A great place to pull up a seat and work from my laptop.  They have also accommodated a menu request that my best friend asked for and have subsequently made it for me. We appreciate that tremendously. I plan to resume riding my cruiser bike to North to park it in the ample bike parking spaces as well as taking my car to the friendly, fast valet on the chillier nights. Excellent."}
{"text":"Service was amazing. The food was really good.  You gotta try the salted caramel budino. Thanks you. We will be back !!   #livlovcupcakes #northitalia"}
{"text":"Went for a late night date. Arrived just as they were closing for the evening but we were greeted pleasantly and seated on the outside patio as requested. We took our time ordering without a pushy waiter waiting to close up and when we finally decided ordered two deserts; the Nutella  crepes and the pear fritters. Both were excellent. Great service, great atmosphere and wonderful warm desserts on a cool evening."}
{"text":"Well, I have this soft spot for the FOX restaurant group because they totally nail it when it comes to atmosphere, decor, and a great staff. But I'm learning that while those are their strengths, it's the flavor of the food that's lacking. Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad by any means, it's ok or good, but it's not great. I can get GREAT pizza and pasta at some other places in the valley, and they may even be cheaper there. So while FOX gets an A+ in most categories, they need to bring their B to an A in flavor. But this is just my opinion so try it for yourself. It's worth going to and sitting at the outside bar is awesome. I will give it another shot there by ordering some other things on the menu. Would love to prove myself wrong."}
{"text":"Good food and nice atmosphere! One of our family's favorite restaurants. Zucca chips, pasta and pizzas are all delicious. We have always had good service and very friendly wait staff.  Another great Fox restaurant!"}
{"text":"Meal was comped went because it was - close to Westin Kierland. Ate at this place and sat outside due to having to wait 45 mins to sit inside. It was about 80 degrees outside and they have mist falling from the ceiling to keep you cool.  For an Italian place, it's alright. There's much better food. I had the steak skirts and came with a salad. I would not recommend this and should have gone for the pasta.  All in all it's pretty not good for the price, but it was free so, whatever."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The pasta w Bolognese is most delish. Great happy hour. Service at times could be better."}
{"text":"Long Time no review. My wife and I went to North the other night for our third time and had a shrimp and pasta dish that we split. The portions are big enough to split and be satisfied and the taste was great. North is not incredible but it is very good. The best thing is that it is at Kierland and the prices are very reasonable. Try it you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Went to North for a birthday dinner tonight with some friends food was average, service was mediocre.  Let me explain, my friend ordered the spicy shrimp pasta it tasted really wrong, we sent it back the server apologized and said it would be off the bill, well it wasn't we had to bring it up to his attention. The menu is average \"chicken parm and spaghetti meatball\" It's good  place but  I feel the menu could be a little more daring and the service more genuine."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza!! I was blown away by the fresh flavors, soft delicate cheese, crispy crust! Mussels were brought out with warm char grilled bread to mop up the lucious broth. The service was incredible also, we were in a rush and were served our meal with check AND food packed to go within 30 minutes (all per our request) and with a smile on our servers face.    excellent, just plain excellent."}
{"text":"NoRTH's great location - in Kierland Commons - is what initially made me try it. I stopped by while out for an evening of shopping with a friend. We were both tired and feeling a little under the weather, so we thought Italian would be nice and comforting.   I had the English pea risotto, which I believe was a special, and my friend had the pasta bolognese. We liked both entrees and felt like the value was good, especially for the area. We also enjoyed prosecco cocktails, which were pricey but tasty. There is better Italian food out there, but NoRTH is good and not terribly overpriced. Well worth a visit if you are in the Kierland area."}
{"text":"We were so impressed with our bartender that we decided to write a review as we enjoyed our meal. Tony, our bartender did a great job of offering us options off of the regular and happy hour menus. We wanted white sangria- they only had red. But he was more than willing to make us a white and it did not disappoint!! We had the artichokes which were delicious and pizza and pasta to finish our meal! Everything was great and Tony was so willing to make our meal the best meal ever!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful evening! The Ono was amazing, and our server recommended a wine that went perfectly with it. Service was great. we will be back."}
{"text":"North has amazing food, staff, and ambience. The restaurant is talkative, but intimate. Food and drink came in great time. The food is amazing! Everything was fresh and tasted fantastic. I highly recommend the artichoke appetizer...the best artichoke I've had. For dessert, you can't do better than the Sea Salt Caramel Bundino. It was the perfect mix of salty and sweet. They treated us so well for our anniversary dinner and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love this place.best grilled cheese EVER.good service and kid friendly .great kid meals.denfinaly I suggest it"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Monday night and got a seat in their cozy patio. Had the zucca chips (tasty but a bit oily) and grilled artichoke for starters. The Short rib entree was excellent as was the Nutella dessert and the apple crumble."}
{"text":"Great food and good service. I would go back here specifically for the Italian Garden salad. It was AMAZING."}
{"text":"This is the best Fox concept! I've only had the best service and the food... I could get fat with how much I would eat the food here!   For appys get the calamari. Served sort of like a salad with arugula and a light lemon vinaigrette sauce.  The gnocchi is my go to meal and rightfully so. This dish so unbelievably rich yet so satisfy. The sauce it's in has this tanginess that makes the dish stand out. The chicken parm is a typical chicken parm but the freshness of the ingredients (everything is fresh!) sets it apart.  The servers are very knowledgable on with the wine list. If I'm ever stuck on what to pick they always have a great suggestion.   Amazing spot for a cozy date or catching up with friends. Good job Sam Fox!"}
{"text":"Have been going here for years and always enjoy food and atmosphere. Recent trip was a bit disappointing for two reasons: first, we were seated at Bar North because the restaurant was full (holiday season), which was not that bad, but lacked the ambiance of the main dining area. My friend ordered the vintage beet salad and said it was wonderful. I ordered the calamari, then we shared  the margherita pizza. The pizza was great. The reason I did not give five stars is the calamari was overcooked, shriveled and crunchy. Normally, when you order this dish, it is very refreshing and flavorful, lightly fried calamari served on a bed of arugula with lemon juice - yummy. I was really looking forward to it, but it was mediocre last time."}
{"text":"My first visit to this recently opened Summerlinrestaurant was as wonderful as I expected due to the majority of 5 Star reviews. Our group of 8 ordered several appetizers, calamari on a bed of arugula was lightly battered and lemony delicious, meatballs, zucchini chips and grilled cauliflower. Each was so delicious and tasty! The dinner was even better from the homemade pasta dishes, salmon, short ribs and the pea soup was amazing.   The service was fantastic.  Our server was friendly, attentive and offered suggestions of favorites which is always nice when trying to decide.  As expected for a newly opened place it was packed and yet the service did not suffer for it. We liked the atmosphere and watching the open kitchen through a big window was fun to see.   Although we were full we saw desserts being served to our neighbors and had to order. The tiramisu was one of the best I've ever had! And the Bombolini (Meyer lemon curd donuts!) were light and fluffy and delicious.   We can't wait to go back for Happy Hour on the patio to order the Chef's Board."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere were amazing, but service mildly sucked.  Went for lunch with some girlfriends I hadn't seen in ages so we wanted a place where we could hang out and enjoy some fine foods and laughs.  It was two vegetarians and 2 non vegers.  The server wasn't sure about which dishes were  vegetarian which made one of my friends a little unsure still whether her dish had chicken stock in it.  We ordered a couple drinks and food that we all shared.  I wasn't a huge fan of my Malbec in a water glass, but the wine itself was nice and inexpensive ($7)   We got the pizza that had brussels sprouts, onions, nuts, and sweet potato that was one of the most delicious pizzas I have ever had (and I have had A LOT of pizza). All the flavors blended perfectly while maintaining their own individual deliciousness.   We also got the pesto tortellini that was also pretty amazing.  It was cool to watch the kitchen crew making the pasta out in the open too.    There was another pasta with red sauce that was good and a chicken sandwich that was also  good, but not overly memorable.   The restaurant is nice open air, with a very relaxed atmosphere that doesn't make you feel you need to rush.   Comp valet was a nice touch to the meal."}
{"text":"NoRth---- Great restaurant to take visitors... Eat at  Bar North just around the corner (much quieter) or sit outside if weather permits...DO NOT take anyone who is hard of hearing to the main restaurant...even when it is slow it is ridiculously loud.  Best items Zucca chips Calamari salad Greens salad Fig and Goat cheese pizza roasted veggies  Love the Pino Nero wine...go ahead...get the terrazo.."}
{"text":"We liked  the food the ambiance and our server Gerardo was amazing!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"New Sam Fox restaurant and I think we have struck gold, baby!!!  We went for breakfast this morning and had a wonderful meal, so we decided to check out their dinner menu.  It was very busy for a Sunday evening and the food was absolutely fabulous!!! We started out with the Italian Salad that had a beautiful lemon, oregano dressing.  After we ranted and raved over that,   I had the Ricotta Gnocchi which was beef short ribs in a horseradish creme and arugula.  It was HEAVENLY!!!! I wanted to swim in it, but that would be weird.  My husband had the pork chop with cabbage and a creamy polenta.  It was prepared to perfection!  And dessert?  Normally we say, \"no\".........but please....Italian donuts in a vanilla marscapone cream with lemon curd?  I wanted to cry. Deeelicious.  This is a FABULOUS new hot spot and we have made it our mission to eat our way through the menu!   The servers and staff ALL had smiles and were so kind.  This is my new fav and THANK YOU for being close to home!!!"}
{"text":"Now how did this slip by?  been here over 20 times, not sure why/how i missed writing about it - i would suppose it's not exactly 'up there' & 'all that', nor really not bad either.  The major saving grace here would be there comfy patio: ESPECIALLY if you snag a sofa.  And it's not one of those patios facing a road - it actually has grass, birds, fountains.... {o, um, ok: alot of kids playing in the water ---- but the peals of laughter still better than traffic}.  Their HH is awesome: 1/2 off all bottles of wine - by glass or bottle - and that goes down quite well in my books - thank. you. very. much.  a few yummy appies at GR8 prices.  luv the angel hair pasta with basil & tomatoe sauce - i add chicken.  i know which waitress will be a relaxing experiencing - and which one, (when she walks toward me i go - o no.... please no...) will not be so fabby... (i had her today) ah well.....  add the bottle of wine, rose coloured glasses, our temps, the sunshine, and thinking of all my relatives back east who still have another mth or so to enjoy patio life - and guess what?   it's all good......"}
{"text":"I went there Sunday for brunch by myself, sat at the bar. Was promtly greeted and given a menu, no smile however. I had a few questions about the coctails which were answered and I debated between two drinks I got the one I didn't order. However I didn't mind because it was fantastic.   I had the fritata which was nice but small, I enjoyed the swiss chard and fingerling potatoe combo and the smoked mozz over the fritata was nice. I also got a side of polenta. Which was not your typical polenta, it was delicious don't get me wrong but it had no texture, it might as well been cream of wheat. It was very creamy and smooth and I was just expecting a more textured dish when it comes to polenta.   I will say I did like the big open space and farm like appeal, however I did not like the dirt patio.  I would like to go back to try some other dishes, some of the pizza's looked more interesting than others and the salads I would like to try.  Over all I would give it 3.5 stars and would come back, at least for a drink if not to eat again."}
{"text":"Customer service - 4.5 stars Occasional mix ups (e.g. main course comes before salad) but they always try to make it right. Manager (Chris) takes care of you and takes your comments seriously (e.g. the overly salted budino is now perfectly salted). Ambience - 4 stars Great date night, girls night out.  A bit noisey for serious conversations. Food - 4 stars Some nights are a hit or miss but generally good.  Great salads.  Branzino is delish.  Ran out of the squid ink pasta so couldn't try it.  Daily pizza special was nicely balanced. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"This restaurant never disappoints me ever! The atmosphere is fun and inviting and the food is beyond superb consistently.  The combination board, margherita pizza and Bolognese split by 2 guests makes the best dinner! Caution! Possible leftovers :D  Plus the service is always top notch with a more than helpful and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Waiter was very helpful, prompt good service. Burrata was just ok. I had the spicy shrimp that was something that I could have microwaved at home. Boyfriend had chicken pasta and he said it was ok. Redeeming: great house red wine for $5."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended and it was as good as all the reviews.  We had appetizers, dinner, dessert, and drinks here and everything was well worth it.  I loved the sweet corn ravioli."}
{"text":"This is a happening place. It was slammed on a Thursday night. My wife and our 18 month old daughter visited North while on vacation. I was between steak or pasta and the waiter recommended the Ricotta Gnocchi which was one of the best entrees I've ever had. Definitely recommend that to anyone coming here."}
{"text":"Eh... pasta is way to salty.  Just just cause Mario B says cook your pasta in salt water, doesn't mean you have too and then dump salty sauce on top of it.  Tried to tell the manager but got blown off.  Just because you work for FRC doesn't mean you know what good food is.  Also, pizza greasy."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight with my son.  One of our favorite Fox restaurants.  Great appetizers.  I had the scallops, which were perfectly crispy on the ouside and tender and moist inside.  My son had the NY STRIP which had the most wonderful sauce and flavor.  The other part of our meal that was excellent was the service. Anna was attentive, knowledgeable and just a pleasure to wait on us."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch. Restaurant was really busy. The server would forget small things that we had to repeatedly ask for. We ordered and had asked for everything to come out all at once but one thing that never came out was our pizza. The server had to constantly check on it and eventually told us that the chefs didn't make it right the first time so they had to redo it. We couldn't wait on the pizza or else the other food would get cold. We waited 30 minute total for the fresh pizza. I think they never even made it because we sat right next to the kitchen and never saw the first one come out \"wrong\". Honestly, the pizza should've been comped but it never was and that was the real bummer. The restaurant messed up and they didn't do anything about it. Food was good otherwise but I hope to have a different server and experience when I come back again."}
{"text":"They do not tell you or show on the menu what all the ingredients are on their food! I ordered two entrees and they both had truffle oil on it, which I can not eat. I told the server I could not eat truffles so she brought me one new entree with out truffle oil but the other entree was not replaced. I did not touch any of my food and they still charged me. Total of bill was $117. Food was definitely not worth it!"}
{"text":"I dig this place.    Took my parents, they're older, so they were not thrilled with the family style tables up front by the bar, nor the loud noise at 7:30 pm on a Friday night - in season.  BUT, that said - the SUPER friendly hostess staff found us a seat outside on the patio, during a recent colder Friday evening (by a heater even, and my mother was so pleased).  We did not have a res., but the staff accommodated us almost immediately, at a very busy time.  My parents were delighted with the quieter porch seating, and loved the place.    I was especially grateful for how we were treated at the door when entering w/o a res, and finding a few couples waiting to eat - who had made reservations.  (Ed. Note - Don't be a Moron like me - Make a Reservation!)  Of course, those people were seated first, but we were not forced to wait long at all, maybe 10 minutes before their crack hostess staff figured something out.  This is important.  I felt like the NoRTH staff was working for us from the get-go.  The table service was equally as solid, and the food was really good.  The calamari and caesar salad were good, and I had spaghetti and meatballs with the house gravy (red sauce for most of you).    Top shelf.  Great overall experience.    Nice job, NoRTH staff.  I won't forget."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! I wish it was a litter closer to home so I could go more often! Fresh, delicious, unique menu items I think about days after I've been there! haha  Service last time was ok, and floor was dangerously slippery - one person actually fell and they still did nothing about it."}
{"text":"I'd love to give this Fox effort a higher rating because of the concept, location, reasonably priced happy hours and above average food, however; due to repeated exposure on the patio, I must say I hope you are not looking for immediate service. The management and staff are actually very nice, but at times, it's difficult to get some attention. The beet salad is one of my recommendations should you visit. I still frequent there often. Maybe they will work this out. The happy hour is a good time to try this place for the first time."}
{"text":"A fox concepts restaurant, which is for the most part consistently quality food. Tried the zucca chips and the margarita pizza. The zucca chips seemed like a must try based on the number of reviews that mention it - they were good, but because they were so thinly sliced there were a  number of them that were burned. Despite, tasty and enjoyable. The margarita pizza on the other hand, was hands down delish. Simple, tasty ingredients in every bite!"}
{"text":"Had the Pizza.  Crust under cooked.  Service was good but food and prices don't match.  Two drinks and a subpar pizza should be under $20.  As it was, I was around $40.  Definitely not worth the visit.  Skip this place.  More hype than substance."}
{"text":"Another great offering from Fox Concept Restaurants. Bravo.  The building looks like a giant barn, and the interior resembles a barn as well. But don't be fooled; this restaurant is CLEAN as a whistle and the lighting is spot on. The servers and bartenders are dressed in jeans and other farm attire so they do look a little goofy, but it works. It just works. The bartenders actually care about you enjoying your experience. They're not there to puff up their chests and flex for the girls. These guys know customer service and they are spectacular.  The food?! Heavenly. The arancini was perfect and the sauce divine. But the real treat was the main course: I tried the Bolognese, which is something I have perfected (in my opinion!) at home. I'm very picky. Luckly, they did not disappoint. The bolognese was very moreish and I could not stop eating. I left a very happy man. Kudos to the guys scurrying around in the open-air kitchen!  And now for my one (and only) bitch about this restaurant: and I nearly took away a star because of it. JUST as the sun was setting, the bartenders took it upon themselves to open all the window-doors surrounding the bar. It's nice, but only when it's 79 degrees outside! And the sun...burst forth and blinded me along with anyone else sitting westward. All the nice cool air just slipped out the restaurant and it became quite uncomfortable.  Yes, I know it's Friday night and you want the restaurant to seem as open as possible...but it's already A BARN! You do not need to open all the windows in the middle of summer...and especially when the sun is still able and willing to stun and piss off your diners.   This restaurant, despite the only one flaw, is a masterpiece. (And guys, STOP going out in public wearing flip flops or sandals. You all look ridiculous.) I step off my soapbox."}
{"text":"We were told to try the calamari appetizer but it's presented as a salad which is not conducive to sharing.  Instead, we shared the zucca chips (fantastic!!), bruschetta (fair), garlic bread (pretty good).  All three dinners were excellent.  The only complaint is that the restaurant's noise level is very high so difficult to have a conversation."}
{"text":"The best spaghetti bolognese in town. Absolutely delicious. Wonderful beet salad, great pizzas too. Amazing place - I love it!"}
{"text":"Went to NoRTH this past week with friends, and our server Jody could not have been better - thanks Jody! The food was super yummy too. Check out the burrata appetizer- it's amazing! The gnocchi were little pillows of heaven, and the sea bass was good, but I actually liked the veggies on top of it more! How fun is that? We had a couple bottles of an Italian wine too, and that was all the better when we asked for stemmed glasses instead of the short glasses that they usually use. We'll be back sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"We dine here and get take out quite a bit but I've been slacking with my reviews so I'm just getting around to writing this review for North.    Sadly, my tolerance for Kierland dictates when and how often I visit North but I really am a fan of this restaurant.    Good selection of tasty appetizers, the burrata is an interesting and delicious selection, bruschetta is a solid choice, fonduta is my absolute favorite with smoky cheese and buttery slices of grilled bread, skip the meat/cheese board - it wasn't bad but I've had better.  I've tried the beet and the seasonal vegetable salads, both were excellent but I'm a beet fan and I thoroughly enjoyed theirs.  The pizza is delicious, Margherita and Fig + Prosciutto are my favorites and they have some interesting pizza specials, I tried one with butternut squash and it was out of this world.  Pasta is made fresh in house which is really a delight, the gnocchi with short rib and horseradish cream is as outrageous as it sounds.  Dark chocolate tart, olive oil cake and caramel budino are all delicious, I'd say the tart is my favorite because of the cookie-like crust and toffee pieces.  The pros: Service has always been good, take out is packaged well, wine selection is good enough and food is always excellent.    The cons: Kierland, parking and tight tables."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Chef's board was great. I'd recommend one of their fancy cocktails with dinner. Our server Brian was hilarious. Only thing was you have to get there early'ish to get a prime seat."}
{"text":"I have flown from Portugal to visit family here in Las Vegas Nevada. We were really hungry and decided to come eat at North Italia. We had a party of 6 and our server Olivia was absolutely amazing. She had served our drinks. And when they were below halfway from being empty she would kindly refill our drinks without us even asking.The food was amazing. She was very knowledgeable of everything we asked about when it came to ordering. The manager came to the table, asked if everything was great(which many restaurant, i never see managers) I had the salmon and it was absolutely amazing. I suggest any dessert there! There TO DIE FOR! I give this place 2 thumbs up. Must come if you love Italian food, great service and yummy food! Tchau!"}
{"text":"Our last evening in Phoenix we really enjoyed our dinner at North. As first time guests, our waiter provided us with the zucchini chips to start our experience. After a few drinks we dove into our main course with the scallops and parmesan cream sauce pasta. Everything tasted great with awesome service. My only advice is to try to sit away from the back wall where the fan from the kitchen blows and was a bit chilly."}
{"text":"It took over 1 hour to get my pizza and this Irish looken guy yelling at people don't know who he was but didn't look right..won't go back.."}
{"text":"Excellent casual Italian with an engaging and friendly staff.  The pizza for lunch was spot on and returned for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed the meatballs, chicken parm and pasta. David at the front door was exceptionally accommodating."}
{"text":"Wanting to grab a quick lunch while shopping around Kierland, we stopped into Italia and they seated us right away on the sunny patio.  While we waited for our fall lasagna and chicken pesto to come out, they bought us some rolls and their house made tomato butter - oh my goodness, it was so good I wanted to just have bread and better for my meal!  It definitely set the stage for our lunch because my lasagna was equally as delicious, if not more! Roasted cubes of butternut squash, mushrooms, pancetta were blanketed with a layer of lasagna noodle and drizzled in a brown butter and hazelnut glaze. If I could have licked my plate clean, I would have!  I'm really glad we did a spur of moment stop into Italia, it was one of the best meals I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Wow. Food was unbelievable. Best I've had in awhile. Service was fantastic too. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went to NoRTH this past weekend for lunch and overall it was a great experience.  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was how bright it was from natural light (tons of windows) and how modern the decor looked.  I also thought it was cool that I could watch the employees make fresh pasta by hand while I waited for my food.  I had the Zucca Chips and Fall Salad (added chicken to it) and both were awesome.  The chips were nicely browned and had a good crunch and weren't overly oily or dry.  The Fall Salad was amazing.  It was topped with literally some of the best grilled chicken I've ever had--cooked and seasoned to perfection, and juicy.  The salad was incredibly fresh and the mix of ingredients sounded a bit odd at first, but tasted wonderful together.  Perfect amount of dressing, too.  The portion sizes were definitely adequate and I left feeling full.  I think the best part of the whole dining experience was the service from my waitress and another waiter.  My waitress was very attentive and super friendly.  A different waiter ran some of my food and refilled my drink a few times, and he was also very pleasant and smiling all the time.  Some of the other employees (namely servers and hostesses) seemed a bit bored, snobbish, or unhappy at times, but all of the people I interacted with were friendly.  While the food was a bit pricey for what I normally spend, I would definitely come back to NoRTH if I was looking for higher quality food in a restaurant with good ambiance and great service."}
{"text":"It's good times when you're sitting on the patio of North people watching on a gorgeous day, and it's even better when you're eating some delicious Italian cuisine. I have never had even a so-so experience at North . . . the service, the food, the ambiance have always been consistently above par, sometimes even excellent, depending upon the time of day dining. The food is always fresh, then menu always has something for every possible craving or desire . . . salads, sandwiches, pizzas, entrees.   Two couples sitting across from us had two pizzas, and as they saw me perusing the menu, they held up a slice and exclaimed \"you can't go wrong with the pizza!\"  I am a huge fan of the thin-crust Neopolitan pizza, and North did not disappoint.  The crust was thin and crispy, the eggplant on top grilled to perfection, the onions caramelized but not soggy, and the portobello firm and tasty. My husband had the Angus burger, which was cooked medium rare to his specifications.  It was accompanied by a huge serving of pasta salad which rivaled the one I make at home that is his favorite (saddens me a bit, but nice to know that we can find a substitute when I'm not in the mood to mess up the kitchen . . .  )  You can always find a great class of wine by the glass, not too expensive either.  They pour a nice-sized glass.  When the weather permits, I always ask for patio seating. It is much more relaxed and quieter than sitting amongst the hubbub of the indoor dining areas.  The garden patio furniture along the far outside railing is prime seating, so comfortable that you could linger there for hours.  Hmm . . . today is another  ideal day . . . Look for us on the patio! :)"}
{"text":"Everything tasted so fresh and handmade. Kind of has a  upscale hipster vibe but still casual enough that I can bring my family too."}
{"text":"Had to try this place out. I'm a sucker for good handmade pasta, prosciutto pizza and crafty cocktails.   This place is hopping with folks so expect to wait at prime time. Luckily the place is large and they are utilizing their outdoor seating with a covered patio and heaters. Inside is more fun as you can smell the aromas coming from the kitchen.   For cocktails we got the Milano mule, it was tasty, unexpected it was served in a glass instead of a coppercup. The other cocktail we got was the Apple bourbon sour. It was very refreshing and tasted just like an apple cinnamon. It was smart how they didn't give a straw so you get the aroma of cinnamon.   The prosciutto fig goat cheese pizza had very tender prosciutto, and was generally piled on. The goat cheese and fig added a nice sweet and savory fruity flavor with the arugula giving a good crunch. The crust was a little much, but it worked great as a delivery system for the goodies.   The bolognese pasta was so delicious. The pasta was tender and the sauce beefy and tomatoey. I told my friend it tastes like pasta that if I had my own italian  grandma at home. A definite comfort food after a long week at work.   The squid ink pasta was delicious. Perfect al dente and a little heat to warm you up inside. The seafood in the dish was just an add on. I could have just eaten the past by itself. It would also taste great with squid ink pasta and the bolognese sauce, would be perfect too.  Service was spot on at our visit. Water cups did not stay low for very long and we were checked on by our waitress multiple times."}
{"text":"It was teachers appreciation week and I went to NoRTH with 5 other people ( we are all teachers) for happy hour.  The appetizers were wonderful- pizza of the day (arugula) as well as meatballs.  We also ordered fried rice balls which were AMAZING!   For entrees ordered a few more pizzas which were all very delicious!  When I casually mentioned to our waiter Sean that it was teacher appreciation week, he said dessert was on him, and we choose three wonderful desserts.  After that the manager (forgot his name) came over  to thank us(as teachers) for what we do ,we def. needed that after a hard week at work!  A big thank to Sean and the staff at NorTH for a wonderful evening!    We never have a bad meal at a Fox Restaurant and this was no exception."}
{"text":"The only down side is that they're in Las Vegas, alas too far to make it my new best place to enjoy very savory Italian food. The chicken pesto was delicious!!! The Margherita pizza was spectacular!!! The spaghetti and meat balls has been redefined!!! I know I'm going overboard with the exclamations, but try it and see why. I'm from LA, so sadly this one or two times before I leave will have to do for a while. The tiramisu was very tasteful too. Stop by, it's amazing."}
{"text":"Happy hour sangria and zucca chips YES We each had a different entree for dinner mine was the STROZZAPRETI which was delish. The others seemed to enjoy their dinner Dessert. Salted Carmel gelato was good but the bobolini donuts were faboulous Service was good. She was very attentive. Can't wait for weather to get s but warmer so we can sit on patio for happy hour. The only downside  I think the prices for entrees is on the high side"}
{"text":"Pasta was good but service was very slow. Table next to us sat after us & they were served hot tea before we got our glasses of wine. Then their pizza arrived before our salads.  Loved the atmosphere so I'll try it again."}
{"text":"Their food is authentico italiano. I loved the arancini to start and my tortellini was homemade and unbelievably excellent. I will come back during happy hour for their deal that includes a bottle of wine. Fox Restaurants are always a high standard."}
{"text":"Bad Service, The manager came over to say hi he said he the GM he took his glasses off 3-4 times to clean them not a sanitary thing to do. This place is just another fox group rip off! Sam Fox is A TOOL!!"}
{"text":"Love the new indoor outdoor bar concept. This will be the new \"it\" patio for the season. Paolo and Jennifer are very attentive and make fantastic cocktails. I've never been disappointed with their food, and my favorites are; zucca chips, chefs board, pizza crust, Bolognese and kale salad. Never thought an old Gap store would be this tasty!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was great. Little pricey for pasta but worth it once in a while."}
{"text":"Amazing Service. Food was all very good to excellent. We had pretty much half the menu, including calamari, gnocchi, pizza & various desserts. It was all very delicious and I can't wait to return. Ambiance is wonderful!"}
{"text":"We went to North last Sunday night.  We were a party of five, and arrived at 8 pm.  The restaurant was not at all busy.    We ordered a fairly routine set of food:  the scallops, a couple of grilled artichokes, a salad, the special, and a thin crust pizza.  We didn't order appetizers, and we ordered by 8.10.    A LONG time elapses.  At about the 8.35 mark, our waiter says that the food will be out in a minute.  He has never offered us any bread, nor does he offer additional beverages.  We did have a (small) ramekin of olives to tide us over.    About ten minutes later, he comes by again, assuring us that the food will be out \"soon\".  I ask if there is a problem, and he looks surprised:  problem, what could be the problem.  However, at this point (about 45 minutes after we've arrived) he realizes that he has bread to offer, and brings over a fairly stale loaf of white bread and their spread.    Finally, at a few minutes after nine, the food begins to appear.  The food is okay, but not great.  No apology is ever tendered for the lengthy delay, and to add insult to injury, the waiter never returns to ask if we want dessert, or want the check.  Finally, a member of our party tracked him down with credit card in hand so that we could leave.   There really is no excuse for this type of service.  If you are having a problem in the kitchen, come over, explain that there's a delay and bring a round of drinks or an appetizer.  Don't act like there's no problem to keep a party sitting 50 minutes waiting for their food when the restaurant is, at most, twenty percent filled."}
{"text":"Complimentary valet, great ambiance, suburb waitstaff, excellent food!  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! Food was fresh, well seasoned, portioned well, and very tasty. Staff was friendly and attentive. The restaurant looks very nice and clean. It's packed all the time so make reservations. This is well worth the trip so don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for just a drink & appetizer at the small bar.  Two open seats were open and we sat right down on a Friday night.    I had a lemon drink (forget the name) but the bartender put a lighter to the lemon.  Really enjoyed this cocktail!  We just tried the bruschetta with asparagus and prosciutto- outstanding!    Nice little spot to stop- in past visits the cheese charcuterie is amazing as well as great salads."}
{"text":"Food was great! The decor was rustic and cute. The service was excellent and the server was very nice. Although the service was good, it did have a flaw. Everyone's starters came, but my wife's salad was no where to be found. For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon. We had to ask a waiter to pass on the message to our waitress. And we found out that the salad was never even written down. But even though the salad came late my wife could care less about how late it was because it was so delicious."}
{"text":"Great service. Food was delicious. Prices were fair. They gave us zuca chips on the house. I'll be ordering those next time I eat here. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place by accident, and we sure are glad we did! This place never disappoints. The ambiance is unlike anything in Phoenix. It is fun to watch the cooks roll out fresh pasta and make ravioli. Fox Concepts has a great thing going on!"}
{"text":"Awesome food with some creative twists. Ambiance is relaxing and modern. Wait staff could use some work. Definitely check it out if you are in the mood for Italian."}
{"text":"The food was okay, nothing great but good. The wait was just too long between entrées. We ordered bruschetta, Italian salad & a pizza. In total, about here for 3 hours for a semi packed restaurant for about the first hour until it died down.  Great service though!!"}
{"text":"Within hours of writing my initial review on Yelp, the manager of North Italia - Kierland location reached out to me. I was very impressed at the professionalism he exhibited and his sincere offer to correct the experience I described. Having been raised in a family business I understand the importance of ensuring that the customer is happy and obviously North's manager, Matthew Shaloo, feels the same way. I will definitely be returning to North to give it another try real soon!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I dined at this place tonight.  It wasn't bad, but there are dozens of better options for Italian food here locally.  Actually, there are numerous better options within a five mile radius.  Very lackluster, and the service wasn't even good.  I probably won't go back unless invited by someone else for a special occasion or something."}
{"text":"We always enjoy Sam Fox restaurants and North Italia was no exception.  We visited on a very busy Labor Day evening but no less than two different managers, the bartender and three servers checked on us through the evening to make sure we were receiving attentive service.  Branzino and mussels are two of our favorite dishes that we tend to order whenever we see them on the menu, and the dishes from North Italia were two of the best we've ever had.  Alexander gave us great wine recommendations so I stopped by the front desk on the way out to thank him.  He was on the phone at the time and even apologized when he hung up because he couldn't talk to me the minute I showed up!  The managers were hustling just as hard as the servers.   Love this place."}
{"text":"Very busy, make sure to make a reservation. Great drinks, great food. We had the cheese board, pasta and mussels. Mussel broth was very flavorful. Fresh made pasta which is not easy to find in Vegas."}
{"text":"A huge fan of Fox restaurants, I was beyond disappointed with my experience at NoRTH. My friends and I love dining out and Fox restaurants are always at the top of our list of places to go. During our recent visit to NoRTH, we started with the bruschetta (with asparagus and prosciutto) and the calamari salad. The bruschetta was tasty, but I simply could not stomach the salad. The arugula was limp and the calamari was 75 percent batter, 20 percent oil and a dash of seafood. It was clear the cooking oil had not been hot enough as the ringlets were soaked with grease. The dressing (which I, thankfully, ordered on the side) was both heavy and bland. Additional acidity (preferably fresh lemon juice) would have brightened the dressing and the salad (which should have been replaced with fresh greens), and the correct temp for the oil would have resulted in crisp, tender morsels of goodness. My friend ordered and enjoyed the pork tenderloin. But my scallops and risotto were undercooked, the former cold in the center, the latter crunchy and chewy, about 3-4 minutes ahead of al dente.  We wanted to enjoy a casual but fabulous dinner and we were looking forward to a lovely meal. I will always love the Fox brand and his amazing concepts, but to sum up this particular experience: #FAIL"}
{"text":"Great pasta! And happy hour is all day Sunday. The food is very rich though so I caution taking your time eating"}
{"text":"The pasta is made in house and absolutely AMAZING! That being said, I wish the portions were larger. The bartender made my drink (sex on the beach) perfectly. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"So everyone keeps saying the service is bad but the food is good....when in reality both are terrible. I ordered a pizza and it tasted like it was a frozen pizza. Sauce had ZERO substance or flavor, almost like someone put ketchup on the pizza. The crust and dough was sub par, the sausage on it tasted like it was from dominos or any other generic fast food pizza joint, in fact the only thing I was pleased with about this pizza was the fresh basil leaves.   HERE is where is gets bad.  The GM (or whoever it was) obviously overheard me saying I didn't like the pizza, so he came by to ask how the pizza was. When i told him it tasted like it was a frozen pizza, he got very defensive and offended saying \"oh well the chef is my best friend and room mate \" in a very demeaning tone, suggesting that if I am insulting his friends shitty cooking I am insulting him as well. Guess what guy....FUCK YOU!!!!  IF YOUR PIZZA SUCKS, TAKE THE ADVICE AND FIX IT......., IF YOU DONT WANT TO HEAR YOUR PIZZA SUCKS,  DONT ASK ME HOW I LIKE YOUR SHIT PIZZA.   Anyways, Yelpers, go somewhere else for italian food. The chefs are bad, service is bad, but they do have fresh vegetables."}
{"text":"We dined here on the Sunday after Valentine's Day. I had made a reservation anticipating it may be a bit busy. It was WAY busier than they could handle it seemed. We had to wait a bit for a table and were then taken to the \"JV dining hall\" as my husband called it - the bar dining area. When we walked in it was bright and full of kids. Not the night out we were looking for. We waited 15 minutes for a glass of wine and nearly an hour for our meal. Our server was not good. And the other servers were clearly agitated. The manager recognized how ridiculous the situation was and apologies to us and took a few items off our bill. While we appreciated that, the damage was done. Bottom line, the service was horrible, the food was good."}
{"text":"Love this place. The pizza is thin and delicious. The artichoke with aioli sauce and the zucca chips are so good. The chicken parm is out of this world as well. We've gone back again and again and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"I'm always in the mood for trying new Italian cuisines, especially when it comes to pizza. My girls and I wanted to meet in the middle since we were coming from different areas, Southwest and North side. North Italia was the spot, nicely situated in Boca Park. We sat in the outdoor patio, which was nice since they had the warmers. I love how open and spacious the restaurant is. Decor was beautiful. This would be a great place to have big groups, lots of seatings available.   We shared the Prosciutto Pizza with gluten free crust (extra $2.50), Chicken Parmesan, and Spaghetti and Meatballs (substituted with Rotini pasta). Wow. Everything was amazing. I love how the fig and goat cheese complimented each other in the prosciutto pizza. The crust was neither stiff as a cardboard or too doughy. The chicken parm had all the right amounts of melted cheeses. The Pasta and meatballs was a good traditional taste, it did have a little spice to it that I liked. Oh, and for dessert...the Hazelnut Torta. It's  Salted caramel gelato on top a warm brownie with toffee pieces and Nutella cream. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere here are amazing. I came here with friends and it was really nice. The service was really good and it was a busy night. I would recommend this place. That also have complementary valet service. Drinks were half off on Sunday."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant that seperates Sam Fox from a restaurant design thief, and places him into a new category.  I loved the Kierland location for years, but the 67th ave locale has a mind, and a charm of its own. Highly rec you visit, the bartenders are cool, and the chopped chxn salad for lunch is still the best in the world...."}
{"text":"Born and raised native of Las Vegas and this is easily a top 5 choice and a regular spot moving forward. Food is exceptional (I recommend the short rib radiatori), drinks are fantastic (apple bourbon sour) & the service was even better. Tacey and Palo at the bar were the best part of our experience, as incredible as the food and drinks were, and cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"It seems to be a very popular restaurant. The homemade side pasta was delicious. We will also come. We recommend reservation"}
{"text":"Love this place!  I'd read about the Sunday all day happy hour, so we made sure to take advantage.  The arrancini appetizer was fantastic!  Fried cheesy risotto goodness in fresh tomato sauce.... Yum!  My favorite is their spaghetti.  I had it with sausage and fresh mozzarella.  It was one of the best bowls of pasta I've ever had.  My husband had the bolognese and really liked it.  For dessert, we had the bombolini.  They were delicious, a perfect small dessert to share.  We will definitely be returning to North again soon!"}
{"text":"An absolute delightful Sunday lunch. Our server was attentive and knowledgable.  My wife and son raved about their Bloody Mary's. Our Chefs plate as an appetizer was a perfect assortment of compotes, cheeses, grilled vegetables, Marconi almonds, fresh toasts, cheese, olives and Prosciutto.  We each ordered three different salads and all were wonderfully prepared and attractively presented.     My wife and I have dined here a number of times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This new Italian restaurant is such a welcome addition to the neighborhood! It's near Pottery Barn and Williams Sonoma. The food and service were amazing! We had the chef's board which was a great start to our meal. The diver scallops were served on top of yummy risotto. The Bolognese sauce over handmade pasta was to die for. The server recommended the ricotta truffle garlic bread with the pasta dish. Sooo good!  The perfect ending was the salted caramel budino for dessert! We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"North has a really great happy hour (all day on Sunday).  First, there are great options for seating in the dining area, bar, or outside on the patio.  Be aware as this place can definitely get pretty busy.  During happy hour they simply offer a house white or a house red and also include a bottle of either with their \"bottle and a board\" deal.  They've got some good snack options on happy hour such as a pretty tasty pizza or charcuterie board.  Their pasta is also worth checking out -- I loved the burrata tortellini.  Overall, it's a good place to go but I don't think the food stands out as anything over the top or unique but it's good bites in a good location."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant over the weekend because it supposed to be one of the hottest places to go right now.... we were sat immediately that was a plus since our reservation was almost an hour ltr, our waiter was super nice and  l love the feeling that we were not been rush to leave after eating, now the food is good we ordered soup and caesar salad and and Two pizzas marguerite and bacon and egg everything was tasty and fresh maybe next time I'll try their pasta as for now is just an ok restaurant."}
{"text":"James was our server and he was amazing!!!  I will come back because the food was aweskme, but because of the service!!    We started with the bruschetta and calamari.  Both exceptional!!!  I ordered  the bolengese and my husband had the ricotta gnocchi.  The gnocchi had a lot of lemon...but good just not for me.  On the other hand my bolengese was the beat pasta I have ever had!!!  We ended the night with a butterscotch  pudding dessert (can't remember the name). This was also delicious!    Again, food was great but the service was amazing.  I look forward to seeing James again very soon!"}
{"text":"This is our send time at North Italia.  The food is great!! This visit I was disappointed with the service, especially for Fox Concept.  We waited almost 20 minutes for our bill, because if this I am not sure I will come back to this location.  The kirkland location was amazing service.    The food is great again, if you like Italia then give it a try."}
{"text":"Service was ok... ambiance was very nice, The Burrata winter squash dish was outstanding perfectly balanced even had these slightly roasted fig-or-dates sooooo good! Yummy!  The pasta Bolognese was not good small portion & the sauce was not that good  I make a way better one at home. The pizza my son ordered was just ok. You want good pizza go to Settebello fantastic pizza."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Bar North which is part of North Italia and all I can say is OMG!   I had the best Bolognese in my life!  The service was not the best...but others got great service from other waiters.   Can't wait to go back and try other items."}
{"text":"North is by far one of my absolute favorite restaurants. Every year I have my birthday dinner here and love bringing new people in to experience the amazing food! The ambiance at North in Arcadia is more relaxed than its sister location at Kierland with a charming and rustic barn feel. It's a great place for couples, groups or meeting your girlfriends for drinks.   As for the food, I would recommend starting with a bowl of their Zucca Chips or the Arancini (fried mushroom risotto stuffed with scamorza cheese and served with red sauce). If these don't get your appetite going then I don't know what else will!  For an entree my favorite dish is the Ricotta Gnocchi (braised beef short rib, horseradish crema and wilted arugula)...yumm! The Fall Lasagna is also a great go to dish however keep in mind that this is a seasonal item. I would highly suggest saving room for dessert as their Affogato is not only super delicious (vanilla gelato and espresso) but the presentation is fun as well.    North is a must try if you've never been.  Once you go I'm sure you'll become a regular whenever the mood for great Italian food, drinks with the ladies or date night hits you!"}
{"text":"Not sure how I went so long before making it to this place! In typical Fox Restaurants fashion this place is full of ambiance and charm. From our table we were able to watch as they made food and it was very entertaining while not being overly distracting.  We came here a little before 1 on a Sunday and were seated immediately. I was pleased to find out that Happy Hour is all day on Sunday!  We ordered the zucca chips (zucchini chips) and they were fantastic, definite must have. Both the Bolognese and Italian grinder were tasty and I'd be happy to eat either dish again.  I regret not having enough room for dessert but that's OK because it just means I'll have to come back soon!  Parking is complimentary valet so be prepared with tip money or you can use the app to tip if you're out of cash."}
{"text":"This is a struggle, because expectations were set high from recommendations and reviews.  I have to say the food was a little disappointing, or at least  inconsistent.  The Italian mixed greens salad was excellent.  The kids had the pepperoni pizza, which was very good.  I favor thin crust pizzas which this was.  I had the tagliatelle.  The pasta was thick, too dense for my taste and the sauce was forgettable.  My wife had the seabass.  The sauce and vegetables overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the fish.  I didn't like it at all.  That said the service was attentive and the atmosphere was casual upscale.  I would be willing to give the place another try."}
{"text":"I was tonight here, made a reservation and everything went well. We had to wait quite a while to get some service. The service was really nice thought. The bruschetta is amazing, I'm still thinking of it. My friend had pasta, it looked really good and she said it was really good. Our waitress recommend us the Chocolate Tart as a dessert. Omg, it was great, like really really good. We also had pumpkin spice ice cream, was good too. I will definitely come back to try the pasta and eat the chocolate tart again."}
{"text":"Went here with some coworkers last week.  Service was very good, server was knowledgeable and knew how to be present without imposing.  We tried various pizzas and pasta dishes.  Their pasta is cooked just the way it should be, al dente.  Most Americans overcook their pasta do don't be surprised if you think it's under done.  I thought it was great.  Valet parking is clutch given that the lot is small and this place is BUSY!"}
{"text":"NORTH FATTORIA ITALIANA (aka NoRTH Arcadia) misses the mark!!! All I got here was slight heartburn & Dirty Shoes & Pants!  How can a Sam Fox concept restaurant,  headed up by the former NOCA chef, Chris Curtiss miss the mark? If your a total Foodie like me, & you like Sauce - Pizza & Wine, olive & ivy, & Bloom you might be in for some disappointment!  When this restaurant was going up I had high hopes for it to be a neighborhood hang out. After all we have a few good restaurants in our neighborhood so one more adds to the selection of my favorite Arcadia hang-outs, and a Sam Fox Concept Restaurant in between Chelsea's Kitchen, The Grind, & LGO should only help minimize the wait time to get a table in any of these awesome eateries!(Woo-Hoo!!!)  Now who puts up a freestanding down to earth restaurant (as it's marketed) next door to U-haul, and only offers valet parking? (WTF!)  Oh yeah, the dirt floor outside patio as organic as it may look will cover your Italian loafers and nicely pressed Slacks in dirt! Seriously, not a good idea for couples on dates in their Sunday best, and expensive shoes. You can pretty much assume if you have a nice automobile that you will valet park, you are going to be dressed to impress, and when you leave dinner to go clubbing or  to your favorite watering whole you will look like a F--king  hobo!   Here is a suggestion, shoot your Architect & get either the guy who did The Parlor on Camelback or the Grind, and  fix not only the Patio, but also the dinning room! Your dinning room is not just Loud, but also very badly designed! (Seriously!)  The Arcadia NoRTH menu is based upon interpretation of traditional Italian cuisine, and is OK, but nothing here is making me say \"I'm craving NoRTH!\"  To be really frank, I like the Pizza and deserts @ LGO/PIZZARIA much better!!!  Sorry Sam but like Radio Milano the snob factor is much higher here than the dinning elegance that your menu pricing warrants!  NoRTH Arcadia (aka NORTH FATTORIA ITALIANA) is another upscale traditional Italian cuisine restaurant with the promise of authentic dishes without the \"snob factor!\"   The 4th time in the last ten years this restaurant concept has been tried in our neighborhood!!! Like the last 3 times I have to say this I don't see that special little something, \"je ne sais quoi.\""}
{"text":"Great place, I like the lunch menu although it's pricey so can't go every day.  I've mostly had the salads and they are always fresh and flavorful.  Service is very attentive, keeping water and beverage glasses full.  Different people come around to check on your satisfaction. Excellent place for a business lunch."}
{"text":"Good basic menu.  The staff is very accommodating to pets on the patio, and were happy to fix a grilled chicken breast for the pooch to eat while we enjoyed the entrees.  Good wine selection also."}
{"text":"I came in with my lady and we had split an appetizer and main meal and got different salads.  The meals are well portioned and salads are a great size.  Got the half size and was still good enough for me.  Tuscan lake was thin sliced kale strips.  The dessert I forgot what the name was but had an orange glaze.  The cake was very like and so was the topping frosting.  Drinks were very tasty as well.  Prices are around 10$ for cocktails and same and higher for dishes."}
{"text":"OK, I've never liked any of the Fox concepts besides Sauce, and I left this place very pleased! Maybe the 5 star is a counter balance of how much disappointed I've been in the past at other places, but this place is great. It seems that italian is Fox's strong area.  The decor is cool, the integrated kitchen is appealing and all in all it's a great concept.  I had the cheff's board, 2 cheeses, 2 meats and some other goodies. The ultra thin slices of meat were tasteful and everything was good. Maybe a little bit of more cheese wouldn't hurt.  The pork belly was good. Not in the amazing side, but pretty decent.  I ordered spinach tortelloni and it was great, full of flavor and with grana padano, I mean, there's nothing not to love when it comes to grana padano.  The desert wasn't that great but maybe I was already full.  The double espresso was good."}
{"text":"I wanted to start by saying that the Fox Restaurants Concepts are my absolute favorite spots in the valley. I have visited almost all of the restaurants that they have to offer here. North Italia on N 40th St in Phoenix has been my favorite by far. I first visited the restaurant back in March for my birthday knowing that it would be amazing just because of my past experiences at this company's restaurants (and not to mention Italian food is my favorite).   Let's get to the food, back in March I went with a few friends for my birthday like I mentioned and we wanted to order so many of the menu items so we shared a few appetizers such as the crispy calamari, the grilled artichoke, bruschetta and the white truffle garlic bread. Every single appetizer was spot on incredible, and I could not get enough of the truffle garlic bread, absolutely perfect! Of course since it was my birthday I had to get dessert, it was the best part, the salted caramel budino was phenomenal I'm craving it just thinking about it. We were there almost till closing and even though the day was almost over the staff was very friendly and joyful about celebrating my birthday. Not to mention the free valet parking? Just when I thought it couldn't get any better!  My second visit was everything I expected after my first one. My friends and I loved it so much we went back for my friend's birthday recently. This time I decided to try the margarita pizza and the zucca chips. First of all, the zucca chips are so good they're addicting, especially dipped in the sauce. We also tried a couple deserts that included the olive oil cake which really wasn't my thing because it didn't have much of a sweet flavor, but we also had tiramisu which is one of my personal favorite deserts which was also very tasty! I have to say that nothing beats the salted caramel budino is still my favorite of the three desserts I have tried. At North Italia you receive good sized portions with a good presentation and the prices are at a great/fair price point varying from lunch to dinner and what type of dish you order. The atmosphere of the restaurant is great because it is very modern and trendy but also has the classic Italian feel. I love being here to dine at night because the tables are lit by candlelight and the option of patio seating that has string lights. Even though it can be a restaurant that tends to be busier and louder on some nights the atmosphere and staff are still fabulous. I do recommend making a reservation if you're going on the weekend because this is a very popular spot for well known reasons!  I'm looking forward to my next visit to North Italia, and I can't wait to try something else that is equally delicious on the menu! If you haven't visited before, I recommend you go soon it's so worth it. Especially for their dessert (yeah I'm obsessed)!"}
{"text":"When looking for a flavorful meal North is the way to go! Amazing seasonal vegetable salad, great pizza, and delicious meatball panini! Staff is always very kind and diligent... I'm in here way to often for Norths TO DIE FOR seasonal vegetable salad!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, it's noisy.  Not a place for a quiet lunch or dinner.  Tomato soup - Awesome Bread - Awesome Pizza - Awesome Angus Burger - OK, little dry Fettuccine - Not a fan, Rock Shrimp were over cooked Caesar - Very Good, nice lemon flavor   Go early as it gets crowded quickly."}
{"text":"Have been here more than a few times this year. Great food, staff, atmosphere & reasonably priced, especially for Scottsdale. This restaurant is a breath of fresh air In an area that is loaded with expensive, unworthy, arrogant restaurateurs."}
{"text":"This is good food.  Do yourself a favor, get the Bolognese pasta.  Pizzas on the happy hour menu are really good too.  I go here all the time and it's consistently good."}
{"text":"The F&B here is 4 to 5 stars. The restaurant itself and the service  is what brought my review to a 3 stars and here is why... The food here is made from scratch and delicious. The homemade pasta has an excellent texture and the sauces are up to the same standard. The wine selection is diverse and well priced and the cocktails are unique and presented well.    The service is a little lack luster. I believe it to be because of the high level of business, not because of some low level of standards. With that aside, the table to space ratio is off. You are either sitting right on top of one another or you are bumping into others trying to get to your table. This can be quite annoying on the other end because people are also bumping into you while you are trying to enjoy your meal.         The 3 star review will not deter me from coming here again. The food, the wine, and the sense of passion behind them is what makes this place stand out. I hope to receive better service next time and perhaps a little more space to breath."}
{"text":"Lunch.   Decided to go light, to blend with the fine day outside.   Began with the zucca chips with \"yum!\" in parentheses... they are quite snack-worthy, so be mindful if with others. You don't want to hoard these lightly salted, thinly sliced nibblets. Zucca chips were followed by an also thin, crispy crust pizza decorated with fig, goat cheese, and prosciutto. The sweet figs mingled with the pungency of the goat cheese just fine. Prosciutto was sparse though.   This light lunch was accompanied by a svelte serving of Fragola, summed up with a trio of cappucino, chocolate, and vanilla gelato, and    cup of coffee, which I am afraid did not seep through my pores... but whatever.  Overall, not bad. I still have some left over pizza, so I'm good."}
{"text":"standard menu-- all the dishes we ordered lacked seasoning, as did our server.   not the greatest concept, fox."}
{"text":"Really good food from the northern region of Italy.  Probably the best calamari I've had.  Perfect batter and super fresh.  Squid Ink Mafaldine and Bolognese were also very good.  Pasta is made in house and it was cooked perfectly.  This is a very nice place for a date night or dinner out with the family.  They have a nice kids meal with options to fit your child's taste."}
{"text":"Went here for Happy Hour with my daughter and had a wonderful time! Sat on the patio and started with the zucca chips - yum! They had a red sangria on the menu and when I asked for a white sangria, they obligingly provided one - delicious! My daughter tried their red wine and was amazed it was only $4 on the menu, she said it was good. We split a seasonal vegetable salad, yum (nicely put on 2 plates for us!) and then ordered dinner and second round of drinks. We truly enjoyed our time at North Italia! Good atmosphere, good service, delicious food - will definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Really great food and everything was absolutely delicious! The service was a little slow and awkward but the food was totally worth it. The place was really cool but the music was a little too loud."}
{"text":"Meh... I was dying to try this place after discovering it on yelp. The pictures were so captivating, I just had to try it. Sadly 3 Stars is a bit of a stretch for our experience at North. The food was lacking and the service was just awful. The waitress disappeared for long periods of time which led to our food being cold and us ultimately passing on desert strictly because of her poor service skills.   Back to the food. After weeks of salivating over those fantastic images I still couldn't decide what I wanted, so needless to say, we over-ordered. See the results below.  Started with the calamari, white truffle garlic bread and the specialty pizza of the day.   Fried calamari arrived on a bed of greens. The taste was very good, however it was cold. I think had the calamari been hot and greens cold this dish could have been elevated to the next level.   Meatball pizza was just \"eh\".  We really only got it for research purposes, and I can honestly say, while it's not bad, it's not the reason to go here.   Garlic bread was prepared very well. Soft inside and crispy outside.   The Bolognese (house specialty) as well came out cold which was disappointing on a brisk winter day. A steaming hot bowl of pasta was just what was in order, I unfortunately had to settle for a lukewarm one. The pasta was good, the sauce was good...   Chicken Parm was moist and not too fried or anything. Not great, not bad.  Overall, this was a disappointingly adequate meal. I am willing to give it another shot and hope for a hot meal and good service. Just not sure I'm in any rush to return."}
{"text":"Nice place. I've gone to the North Italia in Irvine, CA, and it's pretty much the same feel, ambiance, service, etc. The food is consistently good. There is outside dining for cooler days in Las Vegas. The pasta dishes are my favorite, but my companions really enjoyed their pizza selection as well. No complaints about our waitress, but we waited nearly 15 minutes for someone to 'clean up' and outdoor table for us to be seated, even though the restaurant wasn't busy. One of our party members followed up after a 10 minute wait and was told that there is only one hostess available to prep the table. It's a little concerning that during a slow part of a late lunch hour there is still such a delay in busing. But other than that, it was an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"We went there for a dinner today, very nice place, a little noisy for my baby thougt ;) I had the italian wedding soup, it was very good but a little spicy. I also have a glass of wine, prosecco with passion fruit, very good... My husband had a tagliatelle w/braised short ribs, which he said was delicious.  The service was very good as well. The patio looks great for when the weather wams up."}
{"text":"We showed up around 7:15 on a Saturday night with no reservation for a party of four and waited about 40 minutes before being sat.   Frank, our server, was absolutely fantastic! Frankly, he rocked :) also, the food was amazing! The bolognese and Burrata Tortellini were both table hits. While the food was amazing, Frank totally made the experience and next time we're in Phoenix, we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Spectacular!  Started with some mussels in a wine sauce but had some spicy pepperoni to give it a kick. We split a salad great flavor with nuts cheese and fruit. The main pasta dishes, I had Bologness and my wife had a chicken dish in a light cream sauce both to die for. No rooms for dessert"}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town, and wanted to come to a yummy restaurant. The outdoor mall mixed with delicious home-made pasta/pizza dough made this restaurant perfect! Brought a five year old & seven year old, and was totally fine! Most of the audience is older couples, but the trendy atmosphere is accepting to all! Dressed up casual attire- still got away with shorts!   Best dish: mushroom arcini from the appetizer menu! Need to order!!"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZINGLY good!!!  I crave this place all the time!  Portions appear small but somehow I always feel full.  I recommend the Pesto pasta and the Short Braised Pasta.  This isn't your typical italian at all!  The atmosphere is great!  You can see the chefs cooking in their open kitchen.  The layout of the whole restaurant is nice too.  Only thing I don't like is unless you want to walk from across the street, you are forced to valet park ... not my style."}
{"text":"It suits the chicken parm was so undercooked and their pasta was so salty as well as their pizza. Don't go there don't recommend it"}
{"text":"One WORD comes to mind...FLIES!!! (FYI we were inside not on the patio)  The whole dinner was spent swatting at the nasty creatures.  Seriously, no exaggeration THE WHOLE DINNER was one hand swatting away flies and one hand trying to eat.  Evidently the little buggers can not resist steamed mussels. ( I will get to the food part of my review in a second)   Also, I am not a big fan of mandatory valet parking.   No wait, I am pretty sure I don't like mandatory ANYTHING when I go out to eat.   Not even the having to pay part, but I have come to accept this as normal now when dining out.     OK, on to the food.   I thought the food was AWESOME.  The aforementioned mussels were plump and cooked perfectly.  We had a wood-fired pizza with fresh dough that was yummy.   There is this thing called a Chef's Board that I highly recommend (If you are still bent on going in the first place) The dessert was a warm Nutella cake with vanilla gelato and coffee cream with bits of coffee bean in it. Now THAT was a delicious way to end a meal.   Our server was excellent as well.    Bottom line is: I am not going back and I am saddened by that since the food was so good and so was my server."}
{"text":"I do not understand why this place is popular. The service was terrible. I had to ask for my water to be filled up every single time. Most of the time I was literally searching for my waiter waiting for them to come back. I got a salad that was supposedly a seasonal vegetable salad that also had cauliflower, Golden raisins, dates, and obviously seasonal vegetables. It was virtually nothing but a raisin salad. There was no seasonal vegetables, and every single mouthful was a mouth full of the raisins and chewy gigantic dates. Not only was the salad gross it was also very small. The executive chef needs to reevaluate their menu and come up salads with fresh ingredients with balanced flavors not dried fruit salads with an already sweet salad dressing."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place for italian! I have also been to the one in Tucson and can say they are both excellent! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, and be sure to pair with some wine"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for a Christmas Eve dinner.  We walked in 15 minutes early, were given water & a menu, told a server would be with us shortly.  The staff were having a\"party\" behind the bar. A party of 4 were seated next to us several minutes later, and served immediately with drinks and a food order taken.  We sat there, waiting for service.  After 20 minutes, I had enough.  My husband and I left, but not without notifying the incompetent hostess who had a \"deer in head light\" look on her face. She did nothing to correct the situation or offer an explanation. The restaurant was not busy, we were the third customer seated in the dining area.  We must have been just two invisible senior citizens.  Well,  another Scottsdale restaurant gladly served us with class and decorum and better food.  Our dollar is good anywhere.  North Italia....bite me."}
{"text":"I'm really torn on how to review this place.. I wanted to love it, and I've come away not really being sure how I felt. First of all, it's a wait to get seated since it's new. The decor is sleek and modern while still being comfortable.  The menu is relatively small, and moderately priced. Nothing cheap, perse, with a few entrees on the pricier side. We waited a really long time before anyone came over and got a drink order, then we waited some more. You know it's bad when the first 20 minutes of your dinner experience the conversation keeps going back to how thirsty you are. We eventually got our drinks and then after that the pace of the meal was better.  We had the kale salad which was actually the best thing we got, though the portion was not huge, definitely not enough for an entree portion. It was also missing the pancetta, which when you are paying over $10 for a cup and a half of kale, it needs to have all of it's ingredients. We also had the zucca chips which were super thin slices of zuchinni, very tasty, my son loved them, though they were a little on the oily side.  We also had the chicken pesto pasta which I didn't care for, it was very lemony and I couldn't taste any basil, it wasn't awful, but not at all what I'm looking for when I order pesto (typically one of my favorite dishes). We also had the fig and prociutto pizza, again, it was okay, not bad, not good, just okay. My son had kids buttered pasta and meatballs, (the meatballs we're very simple, but very good), (though, the noodles while cooked nicely, were decidedly butter-less). The kids pasta entree was a much larger portion than our adult pasta entree, which was disappointing.  Overall the portions are pretty small for the price, no bread on the table, no refills, the service was barely adequate, and for the money we spent, I could have had a really amazing meal at honey salt.  I'm not saying we wouldn't try it again, but it wouldn't be my first choice. The bar might be nice to stop in for a drink and an appetizer or something, but again, for the money.. eh, you could probably do better. Or worse.. I don't know, it was the purgatory of all restaurant experiences. I wanted to be wowed and I just wasn't..   Eh."}
{"text":"It didn't disappoint. It is on my list of favorite Italian restaurants. The food was very delicious.  Only thing i can point out, is the service does need improvement."}
{"text":"First I have to say that I've only been once and only had appetizers (several as I was with a group on business). We had cocktails, pizzas, and several of their cheese and meat trays.  I wasn't excited to go as I used to have a North in my neighborhood in Glendale and was not impressed. I've also been to the Scottsdale location and the white leather, super modern motif doesn't really do it for me. The food was always \"just ok\" too, especially for the price.  Things have changed. The North in Arcadia is set up to look like a rustic Italian kitchen. I give major kudos for the pasta being freshly made by hand.  The cocktails I was having (called the Quiet Italian Gentleman) were a fantastic mix of rye, amaretto, and two other Italian liquors. Yum!  Another cool note is that they use a hand cranked deli slicer to slice their meats in order not to melt the wonderful fats in the meat. I've never seen this before and enjoyed the touch.  Pizzas were fair to good, but pizza is a tough nut to crack. I think I had every meat and cheese they offered. Every one was quite nice.  The only draw back was that it was HOT inside, which is apparently a problem as the manager came by to advise that an additional unit is being installed so this shouldn't be an issue going forward.  Our server was also excellent.  I'll be back.  PS Parking is valet only, which annoys some people. Not me since it is complementary and makes me feel special so its worth the couple buck tip."}
{"text":"North delivers again!  Sunday is a great day to have lunch or dinner at North.  They have all day happy hour and really good food.  My girlfriend and I came here for lunch with her parents.  We ordered the chefs board and bottle of wine for 20.00 and the bruschetta.  The board was plentiful and bruschetta was on point.  The dishes we had were the Short ribs and gnocchi, the pig pizza, cheese tortellini and another pasta dish.  Everything was great and delicious.  We ended the night with tiramisu, which they do a nice touch with the chocolate beads.  Overall we had great service, and the food was outstanding.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time here and lemme tell you, it was amazing. Service was great, everyone was super friendly and on top of things. It was busy and a little backed up but regardless, they made sure we got the best experience and it's all thanks to their manager Gabriel. He game in to check on us multiple times and I just am out of words. LOVED it, will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Have you ever visited a restaurant and wanted to stay longer, even after you were done eating? That is North Italia. I was visiting from out of town and went to lunch with some girlfriends on a Friday afternoon. It helped that the weather was great, but they had all the doors open even though we were inside.   The vibe of the place is super cool and modern, yet homey. (See pics!) Our waitress was super helpful in recommending popular items and her favorites. She also was sweet to our friend (the Bride, getting married the next day) and made her feel special.   Their presentation was fun, all around. (See photo of mimosa.) I had an arugula and goat cheese pizza with buttery, savory crust. Also to die for: Their sweet and salty caramel dessert. My mouth is watering just thinking of it, but be warned: It is RICH. It looks small, but better to share.  I would love to visit again for an evening meal with friends or on a date. I loved the vibe and the menu, so you know it's a winner."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to checking this place out, since I've heard wonderful things about it. I came during lunch and it wasn't too busy. We were warmly greeted by the hostess and were seated right away. I ordered the squid ink malfadine, which was past with shrimp and calamari. It was so scrumptious and it had a nice spice to it! The lunch portion was large, so I got to take some home with me to enjoy for dinner! I love the ambiance of this place, with all the windows around it made the space feel larger and bright which I enjoyed. Definitely plan to return to sample the other dishes."}
{"text":"How can you not like everything about this place? BEST SPAGHETTI I have ever had! And really, who orders spaghetti out when it's so easy to make? No one, but you must!  Just happened upon it and wow, are you kidding me? It's like the evil critic in Ratatouille when he ate the ratatouille and was just transformed and mesmerized. A basic dish and yet still so fantastically good!  So, yes, all home-made pastas of course, fabulous environment, just a wonderful place. Oh the spicy shrimp spaghetti is amazing too. Sam Fox gets ALL my money!"}
{"text":"Just ordered food for pick up. Wife brought it home and we were amazed with the quality. The taste was fantastic. I got he squid ink noodles and my wife got the house special.  We also got the white truffle garlic bread. I've never been a fan of garlic bread but my wife has to try it everywhere we go. It was very good!  My wife even saw carrot top there when she picked up our food."}
{"text":"Have been to this chain Italian restaurant, but never this location. We made a reservation for 7:15 on the patio, when arrived the restaurant was busy so we had to wait about 10 minutes for our table. (the hostess were very accommodating and offered us a table inside) We didn't mind the wait for a patio table and went to the bar for a glass of wine while we waited. Once seated we ordered the garlic truffle bread, it was absolutely delicious and probably some of the best truffle bread I have ever had plus it's topped with ricotta. Yum!  Our waitress was very friendly and told us about the wine, we opted for the champagne which was also reasonably priced. My husband and I both had salads they were fresh and the dressing was very good. For dinner I enjoyed the \"STROZZAPRETI\", to me it was modern take on chicken alfredo it was absolutely delicious. My husband enjoyed the spaghetti and meatballs and raved about how fresh tasting the pasta was.  We have eaten at this chain in two different locations, each time the food and service has been wonderful. The pasta is made fresh in house everyday and you can tell, it tastes very authentic. The prices are also very reasonable, I highly suggest eating at North Italia if you have one close to you."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  Highly recommend. Was on vacation with family to celebrate birthday. Waiter went the extra mile to place candle on plate for a coffee.  That's what I call great service!"}
{"text":"Wow, great food great prices!  Not your typical boxed noodle Italian.   All day long Sunday Happy Hour wow incredible.  Go early though so you can get an outside table."}
{"text":"One of my favorite casual places to eat in Phoenix.  The food is always quite good and the general ambiance is great.  I particularly love sitting outside here."}
{"text":"The food and service really was fantastic!!  Just that if I am going to pay this much for food I should be full afterwards. I am a pretty big fan of Fox Restaurants so I am not a hater but overtime I eat at North I leave feeling I didn't get the best value."}
{"text":"Went for the happy hour pizza truck night tonight.  It just didn't work at all.  Weird to order from the truck.  PizA was ok.  No waiters to get orders for drinks or apps or salad  This has always been a favorite but o think they've blown it with this promo.  I won't go back"}
{"text":"I went here with 3 friends for a Sunday brunch. One friend ordered \"The Pig\", a three meat pizza. The crust was perfectly fluffy and not too thin. Another ordered the \" Short Rib Hash\". Which is only available on weekends and was delicious.   Suffice to say we will be returning at some time in the near future."}
{"text":"Wow. Worst. Service. Ever. Over 2 hours of not so pleasant dining experience. Found myself reminding our server of our wine order, following up  up on bread request, perhaps refilling water and gave up on dessert order 15 minutes after placing it. Food was good but server A was  10 steps behind all night. Would not recommend to friends or business colleagues."}
{"text":"I love this place. Delicious homemade pasta and a beautiful, open atmosphere. They accommodated my birthday party of about 30 people even though they don't take non-corporate reservations. They were still able to sit us all in the same general area relatively quickly on a busy night. I've gone a couple times since it just opened and I haven't been disappointed once. Sometimes I even stop by here for a drink on the patio while I walk my dog around the neighborhood. While I'm sad that it is no longer that really awesome hand carwash, I can't complain that it is a really awesome Fox Concepts restaurant right down the street from my place. Will definitely go back. Often."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best Italian restaurants! All of the food here is great very tasty and full of flavor. The atmosphere in the restaurant is great very nice. It has a full bar and you can see the kitchen. You can choose to sit inside or outside. Our server Ben was excellent he was very attentive and explained the menu for us definitely coming back to try different things."}
{"text":"I plan on coming back and trying every item this place has to offer. My Bronzino was absolutely perfect and piping hot. The bolognese was the most satisfying portrayal of homemade comfort food. Finally, the amazing, light tiramisu made me so happy and sad at the same time because the meal was over. I'm going to go dream about this restaurant, goodnight."}
{"text":"Love checking out new spots and saw this advertised in an AZ newspaper then yelped it and had to check it out. It's a simple spot with great good. We had the grilled artichoke that was tasty with the lemon zest aioli. We had a prosciutto, fig and arugula pizza delicious! They were accommodating to sub mushrooms on one half because my friend didn't eat prosciutto. The hostess were sweet and helpful and we called ahead to put our name on the list. Our server was  very attentive and fun. We had a great experience."}
{"text":"Let's talk about NoRTH... I have been there a few times, okay quite a few and it is really hit or miss. New Years Eve, NoRTH was the place we decided to celebrate. We were a group of 14 and NoRTH lost our reservation. The manager tried to fake that they did not lose our reservation and move us into Bar NoRTH, which is not the same thing by any mean. It was disappointing to say the least. The food is decent and I will say that the Zucca Chips are a must try, along with the Pear and Gorgonzola Pizza. A little hesitant to go back, the location of NoRTH is great with shopping all around, and their wine list is quite strong. I enjoy the spanish cavas offered on the list partnered with an outside lunch on the patio. The weak performance on New Years Eve definitely was a let down, but again the food is a strong hold of this place."}
{"text":"We visited for my birthday this past July. After my trip to Italy. Few summers ago, it's hard to find Italian food that loves up to my experience there. However, this place nailed it in all aspects. Delicious food, great service and a wonderful ambiance. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I stumbled upon this place one Sunday afternoon.  We decided to stop in for a light lunch.    The inside of this place is beautiful.  It is very open, and there is a spacious patio as well.  The kitchen is in a glass room, which is pretty cool.  Service was extremely bland when we came in.  Our server pretty much lacked a personality.  The food was also pretty bland.  We ordered the calamari appetizer.  It was served with greens, which was an interesting twist on a calamari appetizer.  However there was no sauce, which was odd.  So we asked for a side of lemon aioli.  The calamari itself was chewy, not very good.  I ordered the the bacon and egg pizza, which came with asparagus, potatoes, garlic confit, and rosemary.  The rosemary was overpowering which pretty much ruined the dish.  My husband just ordered their daily soup, which was a chicken vegetable soup.  This was the best thing we had.    Maybe we ordered the wrong things.. Who knows! But I see no reason to return."}
{"text":"Just walked in and the place was mostly empty. Wanted to take my two sons ages 5 and 8 for a nice dinner for Christmas Eve.  Just as she was about to seat us the girl next to her said something and all of a sudden there was a 45 min wait. Empty restaurant. 45 min wait?  And the attitudes... No. Classless, never setting foot in this snooty place again.   Update: been trying to update since Saturday.  Kelly, the manager, was very gracious and went above and beyond to address our concerns.  Because of her, we will give North one more chance and update the review at that time."}
{"text":"Good service quality food product. Affordable on the pasta side and a bit expensive on the steak and such. But the strazzapretti was excellent, kale salad is good and also the gelato was amazing!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Friday nigh (6:30ish).  We had a reservation but still waited, albeit only a short while.    Water was provided right away, and they brought a new cold carafe constantly.  While their water glasses were small, having a ready supply at the table was welcome.  The interior is very nice, including the restrooms.  The open kitchen was really great.  While it was loud (it was pretty full on a Friday night) I was pleasantly surprised it wasn't louder with the cramped seating and background music.  We were seated next to a lovely young couple and their well-behaved baby on one side and a large party of ten or so on the other, but it wasn't raucous.  The service was excellent.  Gracious, friendly hostess and wait staff who seemed to enjoy their jobs (exception for the busboy but that's later).  Staff was attractive, but not in short shorts like Zinburger or Modern Steak (once you go beyond tight jeans to booty shorts I think you become a little tacky).  We had the mussels for an appetizer, and they were surprisingly light.  No heavy wine or butter taste in the sauce, and the salumi was spicier than I expected.  Only a few didn't fully open, and the serving was large.  The bread served with it was best when soaked in the broth at the bottom of the bowl.  Entrees came out very soon after the appetizer, but I didn't really mind, other than the tiny table being packed full.  He ordered \"The Pig\" pizza, and I had a slice.  It was spicier than I expected (and he also had shaken black pepper on it so it really had a kick!), yet also not as oily as you'd think a pork-laden pizza would be.  All the ingredients tasted very fresh, and it was more of a lighter pizza in the vein of Federal (far away from a heavy Chicago or Sicilian style).  The dough was chewy, with air bubbles in the crust and a great texture.  (You can also dip your crust in your leftover mussel broth if you still have the bowl!)  I had the Chicken Parmesan, which was the juiciest chicken parm I've ever had.  The huge slab of chicken breast is breaded, slathered in a marinara sauce, and liberally covered in melted cheese.  The chicken was surrounded by a rigatoni (almost like smaller penne) which was cooked al dente with a great chew.  The rigatoni had the lightest cream-based sauce I've ever eaten.  It wasn't buttery, but tasted of very fresh and light cream and smooth cheese.  The menu describes the sauce as \"grano padano cream\" and it kicked the butt of almost all the alfredo sauces I've had.  (Floridino's heav, creamy, buttery alfredo sauce is more of a rich, decadent, \"cheat day\" meal and can't really be compared to this, not to mention it's $7 less even with chicken.). The only other place I've eaten at that has attempted the whole red sauced chicken with white sauced pasta was Claim Jumper, and this blew them away by far.  I really wanted to try the Salted Caramel dessert, much to my dining companion's eventual dismay.  He decreed it much too salty, even when the caramel sauce was pushed away from the pudding, so only the fresh whipped cream earned his approval.  Be warned that it's very (deliciously) salty!  Star off for: Mandatory valet!  Just for them to park my dinner companion's car ten feet away.  While I understand why they do it (cramped parking spaces, lots of luxury vehicles), it still irks me.  Fox really needs to just buy out one of the neighboring land plots (like the Uhaul place in front of North).  Minus half a star.  Also, a busboy shattered a glass on the floor right behind an older gentleman by carrying a full tray and swinging a highchair in the air.  He didn't apologize or anything, just walked away and reappeared minutes later with a dustpan.  They really should have been apologizing and offering to comp his meal or something to make up for that.  This happened as we were leaving, so maybe the manager made it right afterwards.  Minus another half star.  Overall, I was expecting a more glamorous and higher quality Sauce, but they exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant!! I have been here two times and the food is delicious!! The whole ambiance of this restaurant is unlike anything else I have seen.  The decor is spot on, even down to the servers uniforms.    Ok and the food was AMAZING! I came with a large group so we sorta split everything!  We tried a few of the pizzas and salads and everything was delicious!! Plus they have a house bottle of wine for $20!! (GREAT DEAL)  The only downside is the parking, but where on 40th st doesn't have parking issues :)"}
{"text":"In short, it's a good restaurant as long as you don't mind the strict valet parking rules.  This restaurant is very particular on pushing valet parking.  They pretty much make it as a requirement and not as an option, so it's very inconvenient for those who value freedom of choice.  I arrived at this restaurant without knowing the valet requirement, so I did a self-parking. The valet worker there made a big deal out of it.  He tried to school me about legal liability as if he has a PhD in law and just doing a part time valet job during weekend.  I talked to a manager and she eased off the situation and ask valet worker to make it work (who still tried to give me a hard time after manager told him make it work).  It's all nice and smooth after the parking issue was resolved.  Great food, great service.  This restaurant is about quality and value.  The menu is all about choice (which makes their parking rule quite ironic if you ask me).  I would definitely go back again if this restaurant offers choice for parking, but that probably won't happen.  If you don't care about being forced to valet park, then I would say it's a 4-star.  If you do not like being forced on parking, then consider this review a 2 star."}
{"text":"I had forgotten how good this restaurant was until my daughter came to visit and suggested lunch here. We enjoyed a fantastic grilled artichoke appetizer which had truffle and shaved Parmesan on it and was served with a delicious lemon aioli. We then shared a salad and the soup of the day, roasted tomato. Deliciousness all around! Service was great, even on a busy day and prices perfect. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the open space and atmosphere at North. The grilled artichoke was garlicky and great. The pastas are fantastic as well and the service was great."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with lovely outdoor seating! Great gluten free choices. Service was excellent on a busy evening ."}
{"text":"its always nice when manager/owner  takes care of the specific issue  , we wish this guys buona fortuna!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot with friends! I had been wanting to try this place since it opened and I was planning a lunch with some friends and one of them chose this place- so glad they did!!  Awesome atmosphere, cool decor, very clean bathrooms. Perfect place to catch up with friends and talk. It wasn't noisy, although it might be during dinner when its busier.  The lunch menu had a lot to choose from. One of my friends has a few dietary issues and they were very accommodating. Our server explained the menu and was very helpful in ordering. Our food came our exactly as we requested it.   They have gluten free crust for the pizza, one of my friends choose this and it looked amazing- she said it tasted great! I had the roasted vegetable salad which was super yummy and very filling, my other friend had a green salad with salmon.  Our server was awesome, super fun and very attentive. I will for sure be going back :))"}
{"text":"The service was good for ordering take out everyone was very nice and pleasant. The food itself was disappointing but I'm still open to going back and trying other dishes as I may have just picked the one thing on the menu that was a dud. I ordered the $12 Italian farm salad which turned out to be the portion size of a small side salad which had no meat and a half portion of dressing. Extremely disappointed since I could have gone anywhere else for a better salad at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"North has made big changes to their once awesome Happy Hour menu.  I was pretty disappointed that the spaghetti & meatballs and arancini balls have been removed... The bruschetta of the day was so oily we could not finish it, mortadella, cheese and oil soaked arugula did not show off what I know North is capable of...  On a brighter side, the potato, goat cheese and truffle oil pizza of the day was great. :)"}
{"text":"Absolute best Italian food in town!!! 5 Star all the way around !!! Service is amazing. The food is amazing. The atmosphere is amazing. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"We had the mushroom pizza and the Bolognese with fettuccini style pasta, both were very tasty and enjoyable. It was a take out order that turned into a \"lets eat at this empty table at the bar since we are already have drinks\" type of deal. Speaking of the bar: they needed one extra person back there for a bar that size and it being within the 6-8pm drinking hours for Vegas.   The ambiance was lively and they had a bit of a wait for a table inside so id suggest making reservations on their website if youre coming any day around 6-8pm.   Join there ebite club for $10 off a $20 purchase. Id go back considering their service,  quality and price point.  Hopefully one opens closer to the Strip considering Town Square doesnt have a southern Italian restaurant and lets be honest Brio is a bit tired."}
{"text":"Great food!  Pizza is excellent!  Very loud inside though.  Fox Restaurants are usually only \"OK\" and \"Nothing Special\".  HOWEVER, this one is actually REALLY good!!  Been there a couple times now and will be going back again!  By far the BEST Fox restaurant yet!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch here today for the first time ever.  Atmosphere was nice, Sleek and streamlined. Not fussy.  The menu was simple but a little pricey. Average lunch for one with an ice tea will run you $30.  Waiter was nice, knowledgable and friendly. Love the open kitchen concept. Live music from 11am to 1pm on Saturday. Also a brunch menu.  I ordered a pizza and the Zuchinni chips. Very tasty!      The one and only and HUGE downfall is the infestation of FLIES!!!!!!!  It really made our entire lunch unenjoyable!   When we complained to the waiter about the flies, he commented by saying, \"Yeah, everybody has been complaining about that\" then he went on to say how this year flies are supposed to be the worst ever in history.  So, should I take that as a hint, that of I eat here again I will have to share my food with the fly family ??!!!!     There are too many great places I can eat in this area that I don't need to deal with swooshing flies off of my food every three seconds! So unappetizing and it can't be sanitary especially with the open kitchen concept and the fact that veggies were stacked in open bins on the prep table and bread was stacked in the open air.  Hopefully I won't be picking baby bot flies out of my neck in a few months.   I don't think I will be back.  It is a shame because everything else was great.  Although, Jeff Goldblum would love the place I think!"}
{"text":"THE ZUCCA CHIPS. Oh my gosh I'm obsessed. The service was great & I've never had anything bad here! The cheese & meat plate, delicious. The kale salad add salmon, perfect. The prosciutto & fig pizza, gimme!"}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere. Can be a wait to get in since it's a popular area for tourists. Love the zucca chips and lasagna."}
{"text":"I went for the first time Wednesday evening, beautiful restaurant with great atmosphere.  I sat at the bar and was pretty disappointed with the service- extremely slow  not personable or friendly.  To top it off bartender put my drinks on someone else's bill thinking we were together and then had to wait 20 minutes for them to fix it."}
{"text":"Stopped by today in the middle of the afternoon and the place was dead, mayybe 3-4 tables max.  After the host sat us directly between two tables literally 2 feet on each side of us we asked for another table.  The host had the audacity to tell us the place was completely sold out and all tables were reserved.  We walked out and will never go back."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this new place after hearing much hub bub... and it did not disappoint!   From top to bottom, the experience was great.    Warm, casual vibe ... huge alfresco deck... inside/outside bar area... display kitchen in the back... great overall dining room that simmers with energy.   The food was really good!  The fried calamari was excellent. The batter is a lighter tempura type and not deeply breaded... delicious. Had the short rib with pasta in a parmesan cream sauce... a bit rich and indulgent... but very good.  Almond mascarpone tart for desert was the perfect burst of freshness after the richness of the pasta.   Servers and hosts were friendly and helpful... couldn't be happier.    Can't wait for warmer weather to enjoy the alfresco dining!  Best west side dinner in a long while."}
{"text":"Walked Out - poor service The food is good and the ambiance is great. Saturday brunch service, dismal! How disappointing. We told the hostess we would sit at the bar since the restaurant was about 20% capacity and why not enjoy the view. We somehow confused the high tops next to the bar. We sat there...and sat, and sat. It's not that nobody saw us because just about every server made eye contact with us INCLUDING the hostess. Apparently, if the staff purposely ignored us we would get up and ask for the table. Instead, we got up and told the hostess we were leaving. We walked a few feet away to Honey Salt and got the service we were looking for."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! I'd give it 10 stars if I could. My fiancé and I went here for happy hour and ordered the strawberry mule ($10), the prosciutto asparagus bruschetta ($5 HH), and the pig pizza ($15). The drink was very refreshing, especially since it was 112 degrees outside! The bruschetta was super good! The asparagus was grilled nicely, the cheese was soft and creamy, and the prosciutto went very well with it. Finally, the pizza was perfect! The sauce has a nice garlic flavor, the crust was both soft and crunchy, and the meats were very tasty! Everything was so fresh and delicious! Next time I'd try the happy hour pizza and bottle of wine ($20 HH); what a great deal! I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I want to north with my husband and he got spaghetti and meatballs and I got pizza. Both were pretty good and the ambience was excellent. It is a trendy place and really decorated cute. This would be a good place to go with your girlfriend and have some wine/share a pizza!"}
{"text":"The food was outstanding! Started with the calamari which is to die for then the classic chicken parmigiana with the fresh pasta and ended with the salted caramel budino. Every last bit was pure heaven. This is a must for anyone in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great lighter Italian fare.  Nice variety of salads, pinnini's and thin crust Pizza's in addition to pasta dishes.  Great patio.  Nice wine list and craft cocktails.  My favorite is the Seasonal Ingredients salad with salmon."}
{"text":"I went here for a birthday party for the first time tonight. They have happy hour specials from 3 to 6 and they are great. You can get a chef's board and bottle of white or red wine for $20!   We had the grilled artichoke, zucca chips ($3 at happy hour), and the chef's board and wine. Everything was very good but the zucca chips were amazing. We would buy them by the bag.  For dinner, our party had the margherita pizza, bolognese, and filet of beef. We recommend them all.  Dessert consisted of sorbet (lemon is still refreshing), caramel gelato, and the salted caramel budino. The caramel gelato was very ordinary, while the budino is the dessert of dreams. It tastes like salted caramel toffee. I will definitely be back and could imagine going solely for the zucca chips and budino."}
{"text":"Simply amazing, very hip Northern Italian cuisine. Great food, great atmospher and great local prices. would never go to the strip again for Italian food. The pasta, pizza and salad was very good. love this place will be back tomorrow  night."}
{"text":"The new decorations didn't do anything for the patio, so we sat inside this time. The new hood is much better inside for the smoke and noise.  Service was excellent. I love I can get a terrazzo of wine. Perfect meal for us is zucca chips, chicken parm, and then the butterscotch pudding--fairly affordable and dishes can be shared."}
{"text":"As an Italian from the New York area, I was shocked when my Italian relatives who now live in Arizona were raving about a local Italian restaurant. I'll be honest, I laughed in their face. But they were on point, North Italia is amazing and can be compared to any Italian restaurant in the city. I would classify this place as contemporary classic Italian food.   While my entree was delicious (I has gnocchi in a horseradish sauce), my favorite part of North Italia was the appetizers and sangria! As a table we shared  brussel sprouts spread (to my surprise, I LOVED), calamari, and bruschetta. While each dish sounded like a classic Italian dish, it had its own unique flair. The brussel sprout spread was mixed with motzerella and spread on perfect garlic bread, the calamari laid upon a green citrus salad, and the bruschetta consisted of prosiutto, cheese, and asparagus. I truly fell in love at this restarunt and cannot wait to go back next year when I visit my family."}
{"text":"My wife wanted to go out for lunch so I said we should try North Italia in Summerlin.  It was our first time to try their food and service and we were not disappointed.  We were seated as soon as we arrived my wife had a view of the restaurant and I was able to observe the kitchen staff prepare our meal.    Joe was our waiter and he was most helpful with suggestions on what to eat, we shared a caesar salad, my wife ordered the mushroom pizza with smoked mozzarella and I ordered the pig pizza.  The food came all at once and it was outstanding.  We even tried one of the desserts a bombolini which was one of the best things I have ever tasted.  Thanks to Joe we will be back again very soon to try their Brunch menu."}
{"text":"**Update**  Mike D. called me today to apologize for the not so great experience and invite us back for another try.    I sincerely appreciate the gesture and the fact that he genuinely cared about the experience we had.  I added another star for the follow-up - Thank you Mike.  Also thought I would clarify that of the (7) of us that dined, there were some good meals as well.  My son in law had a pizza which he liked and one of my daughters had a gluten free pasta which she really enjoyed.  We also very much enjoyed the deserts that we had.    Mike commented that they were having some challenges with the Spicy Shrimp dish where the shrimp have been coming out over cooked, and said that they are working on that dish to improve it.  Thank you again for the follow-up Mike!"}
{"text":"Tis the season for Holiday Festivities.  I started my holiday season with hosting a White Elephant Brunch for 14 people at North Italia.  Oh, what a good time!  It was a first time visit for everyone.  I made the reservation for my group about 1 month prior and followed up about a week before to confirm our final number.  Management, the host staff and server, Robert, were all so accommodating.  We visited North Italia this past Sunday ... Sunday Funday ... Happy Hour all day baby!  Happy Hour includes $5 Red Sangrias, $6 Mimosas and Bellinis, Half off Bottles of Wine, $20 Board and Bottles.  Can't beat it!  Majority of us stuck with Red Sangrias and Mimosas.  The Dirty Almond Chai was also a winner.  Everyone ordered different items ranging from Short Rib Hash, Veggie Scrambles, Breakfast Wrap, Nonna Casserole, Americano, Mussels, Strozzapreti and Lemon Donuts.    I must be honest here .... We thoroughly enjoyed the taste of every single dish, everything was season and cooked to perfection.  However, a few dishes came out cold, everything else was lukewarm.  Nothing came out hot except for the Nonna Casserole (which was my favorite dish by the way).  We were starving so we chowed down.  Everyone mentioned their food wasn't that warm but one person absolutely had to send her dish back ... the veggie scramble.  You can't enjoy cold eggs.  Robert was so on point!  She told him the food was too cold to enjoy, he took it back and brought a fresh, steaming hot, delicious veggie scramble in no time.  Also, the mussels were a little disappointing.  Although they had a nice flavor, majority of them were empty or really small.  My friend ordered them and told me to dig in.  I took about 4.  Three of them were empty ... seriously, so I only tried one.  They were pretty small too.  The manager was kind enough to take them off her final bill.  A few of us ordered the short rib hash, again, the flavor was out of this world good but the serving size was small.  There may have been 3 small pieces of short rib on top of crispy potatoes with 2 fried (runny) eggs and grilled bread.  This is important to note because everyone ordered an extra side of crispy potatoes because the menu didn't say the short rib hash comes with potatoes.  Be sure to specify how you'd like your eggs cooked because they come fried very light and runny.  It's definitely not your ordinary short rib hash.   I hope the pictures illustrate how much of a good time we had because we did.  We're planning to try them again soon for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"I went to the North in Tucson once for a birthday party and was not impressed by what I got for the price. Well a trip to this one completely changed my mind about the modern Italian restaurant.   I met a friend at North on a Saturday night. The restaurant was busy so we put our name in for a table. However, we quickly snagged two seats at the bar which were just perfect.  We decided to just go ahead and eat at the bar. The bartender was very attentive and made the experience great. My friend and I quickly ordered a pitcher of Sangria to share. The Sangria was delish, and I think a pretty good deal.   After perusing the menu we both settled on the baked ziti. At 16 dollars I was hoping I was going to get my money's worth. It was so yummy. My friend also really enjoyed her ziti as well. I left North feeling like I got a top notch dining experience. I'm so glad I gave it another chance. Based on the food and service, this is a great restaurant."}
{"text":"It was just ok for me for these reasons. The service started out strong, and it was hard to find the server from mid dinner to the end. The food was nothing you want to say, \"I have to come back again\", unfortunately...especially for the price, I expected more. I ordered Bolognese, Daily Special Pizza, and Calamari. Bolognese - just the usual Bolognese and was not wowed by the sauce. Calamari was good - different which I liked (tossed w lemon vinaigrette with arugula). Daily pizza was sausage and broccolini with white sauce - again nothing special. Felt like I can find other Italian restaurants that has their \"house special\" sauce or better service. It is a pretty restaurant though. Sorry - I really tried to like this place like other reviewers.."}
{"text":"LOVED the Fall Lasagna - a light crepe-type top and bottom, filled with large diced squash, fresh mushrooms and roasted hazelnut, light cheese, and a heavenly slightly sweet and slightly salty sauce!!  LOVED the iced tea!!  LOVED the décor!!  Service was awesome.  I was like a kid on a bar stool, watching them hand-roll and stuff pasta right in front of me.  I am lucky enough to work nearby, so I KNOW I will return!!"}
{"text":"First of all, totally bummed out that the North on 67th is now closed--closer to my house and they had great service too. Oh well....  I love this one at Kierland too. North is great during lunchtime, amazing for dinner. I first came here the year I moved to AZ and a friend introduced this place to me--been hooked ever since.   I like to try new places, and at the same time, I do have a great sense of loyalty---treat me right, and you'll get my business forever!   The entrees are delish----brought some friends here from out of town for lunch and we were completely satisfied, from the service, down to the attention of the staff. We had a very fiesty 2 year old with us and as wonderfully behaved as she is, she was still a little squirmy, and the outdoor seating was perfect so she could 'entertain' while we dined. LOL  I LOVE the fact that the kitchen still makes my mushroom risotto (my favorite place for it) even if its off the menu (off-season or not), and it's always perfection.   Of course, the thing we cant get enough of is the yummmy, Zuka chips. I'm not a zuchinni-lover or even a chip-lover at all, and the combo of it is so addicting! Zuka chips is a must when you dine at North---you'll order one bowl then request another as once you start, you just can't stop :)   And since this is nestled right in the middle of Kierland, walk off your meal while shopping at the huge Barnes n Nobles, Z Gallerie, Anthropologie, and of course, Victoria's Secret. :)"}
{"text":"Looks like this is the new happening place so decided to give it a shot. Nice contemporary decor, very lively ambiance.  The best part, half price wine by the bottle on Sundays!! We got a bottle of prosecco for $18!! What a deal. This will be my new fav Sunday dinner place. We started with their signature truffle ricotta bread which was delicious, however a bit pricy for $11.  They even have a kids menu with all of the kids favorites. My kids tried the Alfredo pasta with grilled chicken which was delicious. My husband tried the strozzapreti, interesting name, our server told us that means \"strangle the priest\"  It was pasta with Parmesan cream sauce, chicken, pine nuts and mushrooms. He loved it. I tried the burrata tortellini served in a light mushroom sauce. I thought it was just ok. I don't think I want to repeat that.  For dessert we had their tiramisu which was absolutely delicious. Loved the little chocolate balls on top, added a nice crunch.  One thing I didn't like was that there is no bread on the house, you don't expect that from an Italian restaurant. The only bread option is the $11 truffle bread.   Updated : Gave a second try... 5 Star all the way!! All credit goes to our fantastic server Cynthia. Took care of every single detail throughout our dinner. Was so kind to my kids. Food was fantastic, tried Aranchini this time, perfectly crisp on the outside, soft gooey mushroom risotto on the inside, red sauce complemented the dish very well. Also, they serve bread now!! That was my disappointment at first visit, so happy to see fresh bread and butter."}
{"text":"Not going back :(    Over priced, small portions.   This may be Northern IItalian food, but really?  Calamari was weird and served with white beans -- ah, not?   Partner order a simple red, meatball pasta and it cost us $19 -- really?  I could feed a family of 4 for less and much, much better.   Order the pork and it was smothered in balsamic reduction and with a goat cheese sauce.  Let it be natural North.    Service was fine. But, that doesn't make me want to go back.    I'd love to show you how to really cook Italian food.  Good Luck but, we won't be back..."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great brunch while dining under the heatlamps on the patio of this cute restaurant. I enjoyed the nonna casserole, with a side of crispy potatoes, and a couple of bloody marys. Casserole was delicious as were the potatoes. My dining companion had the vegetable scramble, which she enjoyed also. Service was very good."}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday night and had great pizza and great service. Non stop attention by our waiter."}
{"text":"Been here twice, pizza and appetizers were great. Service was great, our waitress was very friendly. Deserts are not that tasty."}
{"text":"A big \"thank you\" to Michael, Justin, Kelly for making ours sons Prom a big success! The extra mile that you went to make they feel special and welcome is appreciated! Thank You, Thank You, Thank You!"}
{"text":"I was surprisingly impressed with NoRTH!  Our waiter was Eric, and even though the service was a little slow, he redeemed himself with his drink/wine recommendations.  We're picky with wine and he nailed it! It was the best Zin ever! Loved it!!!  The tomato-melted bruschetta was amazzzzing, but it was a REALLY small portion! I had the chopped salad which had a really unique dressing and my boyfriend had the halibut feature... the orzo side with it was delicious...  We finished with a Cranberry-Basil sorbet which was refreshing and the perfect amount of sweet!  If you're looking for a trendy, italianish restaurant, NoRTH is really top class!"}
{"text":"Sam Fox, you always seem to have a beeline directly to my  wannabe foodie heart.  I came to the New North as I call it just four days after it opened. Usually you think brand new restaurant they are probably still ironing out the kinks right? You must not know Sam Fox like I know him. This man has a knack for turning mediocrity into excellence. I mean the space used to be a car wash! A CAR WASH! Only Fox vision could turn a car wash into  an amazing addition to the Phoenix restaurant scene.   The restaurant is officially called North Fattoria Italiana, which I will tell you was confusing at first. When your friend calls you and says \"Want to go to North, it's the new Sam Fox restaurant?\" \"You mean the one at Kierland? That's not new.\" \"No not that one a new one.\" HUH??  I decided to stop asking questions and just go. Our waitress informed us that Mr. Fox is probably going to take all of his North locations in this more casual direction.   I started my experience with the Julietta cocktail. Super awesome and girly, I love any cocktail with bubbles. Plus the cocktail looks like an accessory to your already cute outfit.   The menu is a neighborhood Italian vibe. Pizza, pasta, antipasti. Of course, there is the Sam Fox flair. I shared the margherita pizza, which was very good and the ricotta gnocchi. Both were stellar. The gnocchi is not a traditional potato gnocchi, but it was very good.   Of course I finished off my meal with dessert. Since, nutella to me is as good as gold I ordered the \"affogato\", and it was a great end to an overall great meal and experience.   A plus was that our waitress was very knowledgeable and attentive. Always nice to have good service when you are spending your hard earned cash. I can't wait to go back and give New North another spin.  Touche Sam Fox, touche."}
{"text":"Great food, but needs upgraded wine list and servers.  The spot is attractive inside, with ample outdoor seating under the sprinklers. The waitstaff is very knowledgeable about the menu, however doesn't seem overly attentive or accommodating. The wine list needs a makeover and a few more higher-end by-the-glass offerings.  The food (or at least the dishes I've had) have all been very solid and my reason I'd give it another shot. The short rib is delicious in various formats.  I'll give it another shot, but wasn't overly impressed by most things outside of the food."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  I liked the atmosphere although it was pretty noisy.  Our server at first seemed like she was not in a great mood but by the end of the evening, she was great.  We started with the cheese and meat board.  Best I have had!!  The portions were generous and so delicious!  We also had the Calamari and it was also the best I have had.  I have had these two dishes in many restaurants and I will totally be back just for these two items!!  There were six of us and everyone raved about their food.  It was fun watching the guy make homemade pastas in their open kitchen.  They have a good happy hour and I will definitely be back to try several other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Had been to NoRTH's sister restaurant \"Sauce\" a few times, figured I'd make the step up to the classier version. Made reservations and were seated within 5 minutes of arriving. Servers brought out an adorable olive tray with green and kalmata olives. Our server (Dominic?) was extremely attentive and knowledgable when I asked about the wines and my date inquired about the beer, and his timing was good. They offer wine by the standard glass and bottle, but they also offer by a glass-and-a-half. This was a perfect pour.  We skipped appetizers and I ordered the pasta bolognese while my boyfriend opted for the chicken parmigiana. After we ordered, we were brought bread and a roasted tomato butter. This was very tasty. My bolognese arrived with giant shells as the pasta, with large shavings of parmesan on top. It was delicous, with the exception of having fennel in it (which is just a personal preference!). I ate almost all of it. Sadly, we found the chicken parm to be a little bland.   To end the evening we ordered the \"nutella mousse cake\" which sounded amazing but was also a bit disappointing. We ate about half of it and when our waiter asked how it was and our response was mediocre, he insisted on comping the dish even though we had eaten half of it. This got big points in my book. He said \"if you don't absolutely love it, I can't charge you for it\". Our bill for two after a good tip for the waiter was about $70.  Overall, I recommend NoRTH.  the only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the parm was a little bland and it was a bit pricey. If you are looking for a nice evening out (and are ready to spend a bit) it is appropriate, but for pasta or pizza, go to \"Sauce\"."}
{"text":"I ordered the Branzino fish entree. It was awful. Every bite I took had very tiny bones in it. It tasted more Mexican than Italian. This is the first meal ever I actually could not eat. On a brighter note I did enjoy our waiter and the calamari appetizer."}
{"text":"Heard great reviews and came out to try with friends and their kids. Great kids menu pricing, however food was salty. Must have been the red sauce? The pizza & spaghetti & meatballs were ordered and both were over salted. Unfortunately it was a packed house and our server seemed to have too many tables so we couldn't get her attention in time.  My food however was very good. Short rib pasta. Rich tasting beef, as if it was braised for days. The date burrata was good, oddly the burrata lacked flavor, almost bland. But the dates made up for it.  Would try going back again. A franchise, so check out the other cities as well."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Friday night at prime time dinner hour and was able to get a table within 10 minutes. Hostess stand was really friendly and seated us. Unfortunately, there was a miscommunication between the hostess stand and the servers and our table wasn't acknowledged for 25 minutes. I finally got up to let the hostess know we had not been helped. Our server Tyler came over and apologized and quickly took care of us. The manager cane over and apologized as well as sent over 3 apps. The zucca chips were mind blowing, great truffle bread and a huge charcuterie board. Our main courses were amazing ( we had the short rib entree and the bologenais). The service that we got after our initial issue was fabulous and they truly made it right. We will definitely be back to check out their happy hour and enjoy another dinner sometime soon. Only reason for 4 stars was the wait time once we were seated. I would absolutely recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour and the $2 pizza and beer promotion. You order the pizza outside from a truck and you get a number and wait forever to have pizza delivered. We opted out of the very petite beers for $2 and after a very long time ordered wine which also took forever. I have always enjoyed this place until tonite. You need to review the concept. Doesn't work!"}
{"text":"We had such an amazing experience at North Fattoria Italiana last Saturday night! Service was exceptional and the food was fantastic! Our server Vanessa was friendly, courteous and knowledgeable and the manager came by to our table to make sure that everything was up to our expectations. We had house salads, crispy potatoes with pecorino & aioli, pizze stracciatella, tagliatelle with sauce bolognese, spinach tortelloni and the summer fruit crostata. If you haven't been to this neighborhood gem in Arcadia, make your reservations now!"}
{"text":"A friend took me to lunch at this location today in thanks for picking her up after selling her car.  I had been to a different North location before.  Interestingly enough this wasn't our intended destination.  We started out at another eatery on the other side of the street but when she mentioned North was here, out of that place we jetted and straight here.  I was looking forward to the amazing fresh pasta bolognese... and wasn't disappointed.  It was even better than the first time I had it.  As with some other the other reviews, the service is hit and miss, and today was a miss.  Took long time to get drinks, then refills, or any attention at all and there were empty tables the place wasn't packed.  I can understand when it's extremely busy, but they were not.  Again, the food was amazing.  I would recommend it to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"Located in Kierland Commons, in a space that appears to be a modern homage to an Italian farmhouse, North will hit the spot for pretty much everyone.  Hip enough for the 20/30-something crowd but down-home enough for oldsters and families.    The happy hour menu is in force all day on Sunday, so you can eat and drink at a normal time on Sunday night at happy hour prices.  The food won't make you forget about Pizzeria Bianco, but it is quite good (especially at happy hour prices).   Even though there is not kids menu, the place is still very family friendly.  We ordered pizza for aC and the server asked us if we wanted that fired up first.  He brought it out when he brought out our apps, which made everyone happy."}
{"text":"Love this place. I have a great experience with service and food almost every time we visit. Such a good location as I can walk here from home (woop, no DD needed). I dream about the gnocchi with short ribs.."}
{"text":"Very good food in a setting that is bustling, maybe too much for the price. Four different meals all prepared well. Delightful server who engaged us well but not too much. I love bolognese and ordered theirs. It was good but not my best.  The ravioli was great. Will come back."}
{"text":"Came here for a date, bartender Eric's service was very quick and efficient, and he recommended the short rib ratiatori, LOVED IT. Will be back for the friendly and fast service and will ask for Eric! This guy is the definition of customer service!"}
{"text":"North Italia is amazing!  I have eaten there twice, and both times my food was absolutely delicious.  The first time I had the pasta bolognese, which they make with their homemade noodles...perfection!  The second time I ordered their burger...and again, it was perfect.  The only problem, is the parking lot is so small and there are all those new restaurants that opened up in the same location, so at times, there is nowhere to park.  We were going to go have brunch here last Sunday, and couldn't because the parking lot was full, and there were so many cars driving around waiting for a place to park.  Anyway, not that it's their fault...just mentioning that."}
{"text":"Ambiance: North italia is located in summerlin las vegas, which is one of the suburbs in Las Vegas. Rampart and charleston is the cross street, the location is situated in dining/social restaurant district since it is dotted with great restaurants and Bars, the food has to be good to compete in the area. The restaurant has a bar and dining area and is ideal for meeting up, and socializing. The decor is modern rustic, the music was a bit loud.   Food: The food had great flavors!  I ordered the braised beef pasta and my wife had the kale salad, the kids had the chicken fingers. My braised beef pasta the meat was tender  and the fresh pasta had bite to it definitely Al Dente, it was not soft. My pasta was great, I actually used the idea at home. The kale salad had the ingredients roasted, and pine nuts. Did not expect  the kale to taste good because it is kale. I was suprised that it was flavorful. The chicken fingers of my kids had some twist and it came out good flavor wise. Over all the food was good.     Service: The staff that served us, missed some request which is totally understandable because of the amount of diners that they are serving is big we had to be on the wait list for 45 min before we got seated. Again please be patient  because the amount of people that dines in north italia is huge, because its new. Sevice should improve overtime.   Overall: It's good food and would like to try the other entrees offerred by North Italia, the service should improve overtime. North  Italia is good for socializing since they have a bar to hang out, the food can be a great topic for conversation since its combinations that I did not expect to taste great but it did. Even copied the  braised beef pasta at home. I would to come back to North Italia in a few months to try other entrees. Definitely a must try if you are in the summerlin area."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Italian places in Vegas. There was a little bit of a wait but that's to be expected of a popular restaurant like this. Service was excellent. Our server Leonard was awesome. Quick and polite. His recommendations were on point af. I will DEFINITELY be coming back!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The location is great, the food is terrific, the restaurant is attractive, and the service staff is friendly, cheerful, helpful and attentive. There is not enough parking, but the valet service takes care of that. I had dinner with two others there last night. We shared the appetizer plate and, except for the dry, over-toasted small pieces of bread, it was just delicious. For entrees, two of us had the strozapreti and liked it very much. The third had the short ribs - loved the ribs, but didn't much care for the sides, which were bland and not very creative. The noise level was much too high inside the restaurant to allow for any kind of conversation. Everyone seemed to be shouting and then there was loud music, too. We asked to be seated outside and they were very nice and accommodating about it."}
{"text":"Hello, ZUCCA chips!!  talk about DIVINE!  even on the menu it says (YUM!) so of course I had to order it as a starter and boy am i happy I did.  They are light, airy, thinly sliced zucchini pieces fries like potato chips. They were flavorful, nicely salted and super tasty!  Only came here for drinks but our server was super nice to bring out bread & tomato paste/spread as well. My friend and I loved how the bread was soft on the inside and had a perfectly crisp crust.   I was thinking about ordering a salad but was already full from dinner so I regret coming here on a full stomach. Must come back when I'm hungry!"}
{"text":"Gluten free pasta? YES! Gluten free pita bread? Yes! Chelsea was excellent  and made it so easy.  The food was fresh, delicious and sooo good. My husband had the short ribs.  Tender. Smoky. Sticky.  Ummm. I had the branzino and it was  fresh and well seasoned. Negatives? None. All were so professional. It was a nice evening."}
{"text":"Long wait for table....... Turned to short. I like this place more !"}
{"text":"I knew this was going to be good when we walked in at ten past 6:00 and had to wait 20 minutes for a table.  We ended up sitting at the bar when a couple of spots cleared out and that worked out for the best.  Our bartender was fantastic and made some great wine and dinner recommendations.  We split the short rib pasta and chicken parmigiana and both were excellent.  We paired that with a very good and well priced bottle of Nebbiolo.  Ended with Tiramisu and an espresso and all was right in the food world."}
{"text":"2nd time here as I travel to PHX for business and I have to say, I was exceptionally impressed with our server Kristina's service. I had their kale salad and short rib and both were delicious! Will definitely be back here next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I went there Saturday night with my wife and 3 granddaughters for the first time.  Very disappointing !!!  After placing our orders I noticed that the waitress made no attempt to bring any bread to the table.  I finally asked our server if bread was available and she said yes and brought some over.  5 pieces of bread for the 5 of us.  Gee thanks.  After we finished our bread she came over and removed the bread plates and \"NEVER\" OFFERED TO ASK IF WE WANTED MORE BREAD\".  THIS IS AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT, RIGHT? Bread at an Italian restaurant is part of the eating experience.  I can only imagine that she was following some restaurant protocol where bread is not offered unless asked for and then give as little as possible in order to keep costs down.  But wait it gets better.  When our meals arrived my granddaughters portions of their kids meals were BIGGER than my wife's and my dinner portions.  My wife's $25.00 order of scallops consisted of 3 half-dollar size scallops,  3 tiny pieces of squash that could fit on a spoon, and maybe a half cup of risotto.  My Bolognese pasta dinner, the restaurant's signature dish, more closely resembled a side of pasta you might get somewhere else.  We were done eating before our granddaughters.  The funny part about the whole meal is that on the menu there is a section called \"small plates\".  Since my \"main course\" was so small I can only imagine that the small plates must come with a magnifying glass.  There is a restaurant a few doors down from this one called \"Honey Salt\" WHERE YOU CAN GET A MUCH BETTER EXPERIENCE AND THEY BRING AS MUCH BREAD AS YOU WANT... WITHOUT ASKING !!!"}
{"text":"Technically this is a chain restaurant which we usually avoid here in Vegas because of the abundance of local places but the Food here is so fabulous that we have to eat here at least once a month. The garlic truffle bread is my favorite appetizer and my go to entree is the short rib radiatori (spelling?). We love going on Sundays.. half price wine!"}
{"text":"Great service, and wonderful food!  My father, husband, and I came here for dinner after a Friday night listening to music at Kierland. We had to wait a little while, so we went back out to listen, but was quickly called to a table, only waiting about 15 minutes. Our server was very knowledgeable, helped with all my questions (I'm a question lady when it comes to meals/menus), and did it all with a big smile on her face. She joked around with us, and made us have a great time.   We will be back...but only when we can afford a night out, it was more on the expensive side. But giving that it's in Kierland, its understandable. Great Fox restaurant concept!"}
{"text":"Two Words: Go North  This place is the new wave here in Summerlin. Been here twice. Once with my lovely client who knows the owner and the second time on a date.   It reminds me of being back in LA - quality food, great service and open concept.   My favorite dish is the bolognese - the pasta is made fresh daily. I also love their white truffle garlic bread!   Their cocktails are amazing! I got the one with green chartreuse in it because that's my jam. Everyone from the hostess to the waitress are amazing.  10/10!"}
{"text":"We are locals and it was our first time at the restaurant. The service started out really slow, 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged we were seated at the table.  I ordered the chicken parmigiana, it was the best I ever had. My husband is Italian and is extremely critical of Italian food at restaurants, he agreed it was the best we ever had. He had the bolognese pasta and asked for a side of sausage, which was not on the menu.  The side came late, but both were excellent.  They comp'd the sausage.  Coffee and the salted caramel budino were excellent as well.  The waitress did her best to make up for the initial tardiness and in the end we were very pleased and will go back.    We went back for dinner and I had the same chicken parm it was so good.  Hubs had the rosemary chicken, which was delicious.  The cranberry marscopone was to die for.  In spite of the excellent food , they still need to pick up the service level.  We were done with the appetizer by the time we got our cocktails.  Btw Hub's manhattan was excellent.  The coffee was old and cold...should have been tossed.  The refill was perfect.  Both women's restroom stalls were out of tp!"}
{"text":"Most important info first: HH is 2-6PM, Mon-Thurs. You're welcome. Their happy hour is one of my favorites in town, and they have the best deal with a chef's board of meats and cheeses PLUS a bottle of wine for only $20. Winning!  While I usually visit for HH, the menu is full of great options from apps to desserts- their sea salt caramel bundino is a must-order for me, and their pasta portions are large and shareable. So far, I have yet to try the pizzas but they have a featured daily special each day with seasonal produce. I also hear rave reviews about their truffle bread. Location is gorgeous, opt for the patio if tables are available. Staff have been really great about accommodating tweaks to orders due to dietary restrictions, which is really appreciated.  TIP: Sign up online for their email list for $10 off your first visit and make reservations through the OpenTable app because they're usually busy!"}
{"text":"This was probably one of the best meals I've ever had. The entire experience was amazing from the moment we walked in the door until we left. Service was top notch, appetizers were great, the diner was amazing, and then we topped it all off with desert even though there wasn't any room left. The only negative thing I can think of is that I'm only in Tempe for a week. We will be stopping back again before we leave. This place really is that good."}
{"text":"North Italia is great! My friend and I were killing time in Kierland Commons before we could head to the airport for our flight. We had done as much shopping and browsing that we could handle and found ourselves starving, so we started looking for a place to eat. We wandered by North Italia and the restaurant looked pretty cute with lovely outdoor seating, so we decided to eat there. We told the hostess that we wanted to sit outside, so she led us to a large table on the patio, where we were able to spread out. Our waiter was great - it took us a while to figure out what to eat and drink, but he was very patient and kept checking in until we finally figured out what to order. We ended up trying: the arancini, the prosciutto pizza, and the chicken pesto pasta. Since we had mentioned that we were sharing everything, our waiter had our pasta dish split in two, so that we each had our own bowl! Everything was delicious! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The calamari was great, tortellini was amazing!  Atmosphere was great but it was a little dark to read the menu, even for me."}
{"text":"We visit North Italia at Kierland often and it never fails to deliver outstanding food at great prices.  Tonight was no exception.  The Kale Salad is one of our favorites and the pizza of the day was chewy, complex and delicious. The happy hour cheese and meat board is a great bargain.  Don't miss it. Our server, Kyle, was fast,courteous and full of information.  We love all the Sam Fox restaurants and they remain one of the best things about living in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great consistency happens with Fox Restaurants! As a longtime fan of North  I am glad to have a closer location for my wife and me to visit.  They have a great selection of wines here and I can comfortably recommend anything on their menu.  The bruschetta is always my starter.    This location looks very different from their fancier look but the italian country decor is not bad. They changed the menu from my last visit but the selections are still very good.  I ordered the chicken sandwich with apricot jelly and loved it."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!  First off their all day Sunday happy hour is the best!!  Service is always friendly and the food is great.  We love watching them make pasta in the kitchen - and just the fact that it's all open and you can watch them working is fun.  Decent wines and Italian food that passes the critical test of my Italian wife makes me a happy camper.  :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple time now, and I'm a big fan. So far I've had pizza, and salads with salmon. Some appetizers, too.  The pizza was pretty good. The crust was a little soft, even though I asked for it well done, but the toppings and flavor were top notch.  The salads are definitely the star for me though. Came here for lunch with the wife one day and was not super hungry, so didn't bother with a full meal. Salad sounded good, so I had a caesar with grilled salmon added. Oh boy, this was delicious. The salmon was cooked perfectly, the salad was crisp and fresh. My only complaint is that they were a little short on dressing. I've had this salad on three visits now, and unfortunately they're a little inconsistent with serving size. Twice was good and the most recent time I felt like I got a \"lunch portion\" even though I was billed the full price and didn't ask for a lunch-size portion. Salmon was still the proper size though! And still delicious.  I'm glad this place is so close to me. I don't eat out often for lunch, but this is one of my go-to spots now."}
{"text":"Trendy menu displaying new age Italian.  It's not Your grandmother's Italian restaurant but she Would like the food.  Can be loud, service is great."}
{"text":"Such a fun place to let loose and relax!  Taking its cue from an Italian trattoria, NoRTH offers a fresh new approach to Modern Italian cuisine. With sleek interiors, a sexy atmosphere, and a menu offering unique antipasti, gourmet pizzas, inventive pasta dishes and many wood roasted and grilled dishes, NoRTH is the perfect spot for any dining occasion. NoRTH appeals to a variety of guests seeking a casual, hip and upbeat venue with deliciously affordable fare."}
{"text":"Amazing Food! Mussels are Deeelish! Great service! I feel bad for not remembering the name of our waitress but she was always smiling, and that's so refreshing nowadays! The place is small and could use better table placing b/c we felt cramped. But overall, love this place! Definitely telling friends and will be back!"}
{"text":"Only 4 stars? Seriously? Let me explain.   With the hostess telling me only 20 minutes, but ended up waiting longer = 4 stars.  With a half marathon to run the following day, and ordering just spaghetti and meatballs that was average, but spaghetti and meatballs taste the same for me everywhere = 4 stars.  However, the hostess did comp a free appetizer for our long wait, so that was awesome. In addition, the wifey and our friends from out of town had no complaints of the food, so that is deserving of 4 stars. I guess my only complaint is I have to try this place again with ordering something different.  Although the place was popping on a Friday night, and it has a great vibe for bringing out of towners or a date night. We will see you again North!"}
{"text":"Great service, decor, and FOOD,  I've only eaten here once, but highly recommend the bolognese pasta, strozzapreti, chicken parm & zucca chips!  The pastas are fresh and the flavors & portions are great!"}
{"text":"Always one of my favorite places.. Best deal going for happy hour is the \" Bottle and Board \" chefs board of charcuterie and a bottle of wine for 20 bucks!  Besides that the food is always killer good!"}
{"text":"We came in here on a saturday night for dinner before heading out- they were on a little bit of a wait but they took our cell # and said they would give us a call once our table is ready. We went down the strret a little bit and had a glass of wine and then headed back. We sat out on the patio- it was a perfect night out.   We started with the Grilled Artichokes- yeas a little messy but definiately worth it!! They were delicious!! I had the bucatini with short rib and that was really good too! Our server ws really nice and helpful with wine list and menu"}
{"text":"I had a hard time trying to figure out what to order because so many things looked delicious on the menu.   We started with the grilled artichoke. Wow! Amazing! They grill it with truffle oil and some parm. The dipping sauce was a lemon aioli. I could have eaten 5 of those things! It was delicious.   For lunch I had the burger wrapped in lettuce! It had melted fontina, tomato jam, grilled onions and a perfectly cooked medium rare patty! It was served with a side of \"crispy potatoes\" (these delicious crispy potatoes with some sort of cheese roasted on top) . I would order a side of those just because they are delicious!   I rounded out the meal with the Nutella trifle and a coffee... Enough said.   The servers were amazing! Not only were they nice but they also had great menu suggestions. One told me I reminded him of Penelope Cruz so he gets an A+ in my book ;) .   Perfect place to drop into for a meal during a shopping day!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite spot so far for brunch. You walk in and the restaurant is so calming with neutral decor. They have alfresco dinning so that's a plus for me. We shared the Prosciutto Brucheta appetizer it was so delicious. My husband had the Baked French toast and I had their Egg Sandwich accompanied by a glass of Bellini, It was super yummy. This is the perfect place for a girls day out. Thank you to Jacqueline for the great service. You made our first time here a good great one."}
{"text":"Came for lunch today, as it is my new tradition to try a new restaurant every Monday. It helps ease the transition between the weekend and the work week. That being said, with only an hour to spare (including travel time) I come prepared with my exact order. The only reason I am giving North Italia a 4 star and not a 5 star is because I really wanted to try their Burrata appetizer (I'm OBSESSED with burrata) only to be told it was sold out. :( So sad...especially since it was just after 12pm. And because my mind was already made, I struggled to decide on my new order. I ended up getting the strozzapreti pasta which was very flavorful and came with lots of chicken, mushrooms, toasted pine nuts (it could have used a tiny bit more spinach for this veggie loving girl). A side note to anyone reading this though..the leftovers do not heat up very well, try to finish it at the restaurant. Now all that being said....the staff was WONDERFUL. Absolutely spectacular. So very tentative and I actually didn't feel like I was dining along. When you go, ask the bartender to tell you his scarecrow joke...hilarious. I may have already posted it on Facebook. A big bravo to all of you...I'll be back, hopefully for some buratta (and that truffle garlic bread)."}
{"text":"Excellent food and ambiance. I've been here twice and nice waiters and hostess but looks like Kitchen was overwhelmed for lunch crowd. Spent 2 hours for lunch but got there super early 1115am. I'd come back for sure - great food and vibe just need better execution for Kitchen speed but taste quality is top notched. Blows away CPK and Wolfgang Pucks in my opinion for all categories pricing, ambiance and food."}
{"text":"Evyn made my night by adding something  not on the menu that was not there so I can have what I wanted and that was shrimp Alfredo .. with her service I felt great"}
{"text":"Best bolognese! Gluten-free pasta also available and is very delicious (no extra charge for the GF pasta, which was very nice, as many places charge for GF options). Staff was prompt and courteous...present, but not overbearing. A++"}
{"text":"I am only giving this restaurant 3 stars because the food was not that good. The atmosphere is very trendy and hip. They have patio seating which is nice but it was so loud you are basically screaming at each other and your waiter.  I ordered the antipasto salad with grilled chicken and my son ordered spaghetti with meatballs. The food came out and the portions are small. I get they are lunch size but dang my son only got 1 tiny meatball. The salad I got was bland, barely any dressing on it so all you could taste was the mixed greens lettuce.   I'm sorry but for 3 people for lunch $100, for not great food is ridiculous. I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"We enjoy dining on the patio at North.  For starters, I love that they bring a little dish of assorted olives to nibble on right away.  Their zuchini chips are a fun snack.  I had the grilled artichoke for my starter, and it was delicious.  I ordered the pappardele with short rib ragout for my entree.  Apparently they recently started making all their pasta fresh in-house, and a lot of my noodles had stuck together in a big clump when they cooked.  The dish was replaced in a flash, delivered by the manager who apologized and said that he'd shown it to the kitchen and they had discussed how to prevent it happening in future.  The new serving of noodles was wonderfully delicate, and the short rib ragout was rich, flavorful and tender."}
{"text":"Love the decor here and LOVE the chicken Parmigiano. Best chicken I've ever had and the pasta was cooked just right.   Other memorable dishes (and I tried almost everything): - Burrata appetizer - Zucca chips, surprisingly - Strozzapreti - spicy salami on the board - Kale salad - Arancini - Meatballs - Prosciutto Fig pizza  The Branzino was too salty for me and I thought their desserts fell a bit short. But that's comparing critically with food in LA. Overall still a great place and we went twice on this trip and will go again!"}
{"text":"Just in Town to see my brother and this is on the top of my list to always make sure and go. i love it... such good food... Short ribs so yummy... so much flavor.  simple salad so yummy. Chef board  is a must . Pizza amazing, i think all the dinners here are good. yes had one problem but it was fixed so fast and our Server was super nice.he  made sure we had everything we needed while we where there.. every time  time i am in AZ this is on the top of my must go list!"}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying I have a soft spot for ANY Fox restaurant. I've tried most of them and I haven't been disappointed by any of them. North is no exception. The atmosphere is cool and the food is great. I've had the Margherita pizza, the pig and the bolognese pasta. All were exceptional. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times since this restaurant opened both for happy hour and dinner and usually have been very pleased.  When they remodeled the restaurant several years ago the type of floor they installed does not absorb the noise, therefore, on a busy Saturday night the noise is almost unbearable.  You cannot talk to your partner, the server has to repeat everything, as does the diner.  The food is not as good as in the past.  I had the bruschetta, which is one of my favorites and it was not as good as it used to be.  The soup, though, was good.  Also, the Bolognese was only fair and very spicy.  It did not reheat well. The service was good, but all in all, a disappointing meal and dining experience.  We do not plan on returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have so many feelings about North Italia, I don't even know where to begin!  I'm going to preface this review by saying that I was given a list of about 10 restaurants that serve lasagna and this was the one I picked!  We got to the restaurant & I'm not a huge fan of valet parking so it was a bit of a disappointment that they didn't have an option to self-park but for the sake of convenience, it was alright. I had made a reservation so we were seated at a table right away. The ambiance was great; equally perfect for a date night or for a group dinner with friends. Also really appealing is the all-day happy hour on Sundays!  After a quick glance, we decided on sangria & beer to drink and Zucca Chips to snack on. They all came out in a reasonable amount of time & we were enjoying away. The sangria was different, not as strong I expected, but still good. The Zucca Chips were highly addicting! -- Just a note that if you order them, consider asking for some lemon aioli dip! Delicious.  When our waiter came back around, we were ready to place our meal orders. We were SO disappointed when they told us the lasagna was all out!! After much debate, we went with the Strozzapreti & the Spinach Tortellini. The Strozzapreti was rich & hearty, the portion was large enough that I was able to have a little leftover for the next day. Mushrooms & spinach in the sauce were the highlights. I'd consider asking them to leave off the chicken & add more of the veggies if I got it again. The Spinach Tortellini was good, much lighter than the Strozzapreti. Again, the mushrooms & sauce went well with the pieces of Spinach Tortellini. We rounded out our meal with some Italian Donuts - not sure the hype about those; they were alright, but didn't leave much of an impression.  I will say that I think our experience would've been much better if we were in the mood for any pasta. Since we were pretty much banking on getting the lasagna, it was really hard to make up for it. I haven't crossed this off the list and REALLY want to come back for the lasagna!!"}
{"text":"My favorite cuisine is Italian and when I heard they were opened here in summerlin I was extremely excited! I've heard such great things about them and their food. As you walk in there is a huge outdoor patio that is heated during the winter with a lakeside backdrop. The place inside is huge! Our waiter was awesome and explained everything that was a favorite on the menu. I love truffle so we ordered the truffle garlic bread with fresh ricotta cheese served in a skillet! It was flavorful and a good size, along with it we got a tomato bisque. We ordered for the entree Chicken Pesto pasta and tortellini pasta! They were both great dishes but the only con was their portions are so small! I wish they had bigger portions especially because the food is so flavorful. For dessert we opted for the hazelnut Torta, it had rich chocolate flavor and to soften the taste the hazelnut makes it the perfect flavor combo. We will be back to try other dishes.  5/21/18 UPDATE STILL amazing, we were able to try happy hour and they have the best around town, everything is priced great and the happy hour menu is delicious! What I love about this place is that their pasta is made fresh and handmade here at the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is one of my sisters favorites! They have a wonderful happy hour special of a bottle of wine and a pizza for $20. Hard to beat. The boards are full of wonderful delights and we have yet to try anything that we did not like. The wait staff is very happy helpful and efficient. Use the valet parking because the parking is minimal and when valeting they get you in and out fast. Seating is great inside or out. They have wonderful misters and heaters to help when seating out on the patio one of our favorite areas or inside has wonderful views of the great looking bar and modern decor. Good place to met for a date with your wife for happy hour or romantic night on the town. Dress can be casual or up scale it all depends on you. Fun place great food and a place one would want to return to."}
{"text":"Great place. Good is almost always wonderful and portions are nit overly large but just right. Zuccini chips are a must have appitizer. Cuts of steak are very nice and tender. Pizzas are thin crust and tasty. Pasta dishes are simple but tasty. Great staff."}
{"text":"Excellent food - had the chefs board appetizer and it won't disappoint!  Would have given it 5 stars if they would give free bread and oil - this is an upscale Italian restaurant after all!  Service was fab and the wine list is very extensive.  Definitely valet park as there is NO self parking in the area.  Salads are very fresh and pasta is made fresh every day - great place!"}
{"text":"Pros and cons, but I'm a fan and will be back.   We loved the atmosphere and service of this new space. Things came out quickly and efficiently and the food we had was delicious: zucca chips, antipasto platter and calamari. I'm not always a calamari fan, but it was delicious.  The drawback: when we arrived we were told artichokes weren't on the menu. No problem, believe me, but then the first wine I ordered wasn't available, and then one of the 3 appetizers we ordered wasn't available. And then the antipasto cane with the cheese that supposedly wasn't available with appetizer we couldn't have, and the calamari came with arugula the waiter apologized for not having. All things that can be smoothed over with time and I'll be checking back in to see how they're doing."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. The happy hour menu is a good selection and great food! I highly recommend the zucca chips or the chef's board! You won't be disappointed. The pizza is delicious too. Very thin crust and crispy."}
{"text":"This evening my other half and I returned to North in Arcadia. I had spoken with Chris, the manager about my experience and since he was eager for us to return and my Hubs was willing to try another meal here ,we came in. We were seated promptly. Inside for this occasion and I wasn't disappointed. Why? Because we were close to the kitchen and I could see them actually slicing meat for the Board appetizers as well as fresh pasta being assembled for cooking. There was a hand pasta roller so I can only assume I missed them actually making the noodles :(  The Zucca chips.. AWESOME! My hubs actually told me that this would be the only time he enjoyed eating a vegetable. Ok, so they are fried  but oh so delicious! Mm mm... Mmmmmm. I decided to try the Margherita pizza since  I sawit being served  the last time we were here and salad. I did not regret it!  It was wood fired and had some \"burned\" spots but that is what I LOVE! Just ask my man and he will tell you that when he's ready to throw out the burned BBQ I demand it. Sorry,but that is the best part and so it was here. Although that wasn't really burned pizza, it was the tastiest part. :) And the Hubs? He ordered the Rosemary chicken that included roasted vegetables and au jus. He was absolutely delighted with his selection (ok, minus the veggies. Ask and you will be told they are against his religion. LOL).  His only wish was for more au jus. I tried  a piece of the charred broccoli and for me, perfection! I love charred food . So much so that  I might ask for these next time we visit. Chris even stopped by to see how we were enjoying ourselves and we appreciated it. Will we be back? I think so.  Parking is easy since there is complimentary valet parking. The indoor seating was fine.  We've been on the patio and would probably ask for a location near the windows or the shrubbery since the corner seating was a bit noisy for the Mister . The bar looks fun. There was a few people that rode in on bicycles and were seated there. From what I saw they were having a grand ol' time. Service was fast,food was hot and drinks were cold."}
{"text":"I cannot explain how much I love the food here, especially the Fungi pizza. to.die.for. They have a great happy hour menu from 3-6 and all day Sunday, which I appreciate.  The service is hit and miss.  If only they could be more consistent with the service, this place would knock it out of the park."}
{"text":"It was my mom's and my first time here. The one thing I didn't like much is the fact that you HAVE to use the valet. Granted, it's complimentary, but what kind of a jerk doesn't tip the valet?  We had meatballs for our app. Umm, delish!!! So moist and yummy, plus the toast that comes with was to die for!  Next was marguerita pizza. It was a little salty for my liking, but still very yummy.  We sat at the bar, and our waitress/bartender was SUPER sweet and attentive! I give her 5 stars all on her own!  Definitely will make this a regular spot, but I might ride my bike next time (they have bike locks on the patio!)"}
{"text":"Fantastic! My wife and I decided to try out North Italia for our date last night and it was quite a memorable experience. The service was great, the food was delicious from starter to dessert (we had the arancini, meatballs, bolognese, strozzapretti, & salted caramel budino). The stars were the strozzapretti and budino, both were INCREDIBLE! We will definitely be back for more soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch on a Saturday, there was no wait and we were seated right away. Really love the decor and the outdoor seating. Everything on the menu looked amazing but I opted for the short rib hash. Food was delicious as expected. There are a variety of delicious sounding alcoholic drinks but I opted for their freshly brewed coffee.   My friend ordered their yogurt bowl that I wish I had ordered too. It was enormous and so so good! I will have to order that for myself next time. Overall, a great Saturday brunch and a great spot to hang out and catch up with friends."}
{"text":"\"EXCUSE ME!\"  Such was the theme of the night.  Trying to get good service here is nearly impossible.  Servers would walk past our table without even a second glance causing us to have to scream and flag them down.  Ugh.  We stopped in for some drinks and dessert, after an early dinner elsewhere in NoSco.  After our experience I'm not sure that I would return for lunch or dinner....and it makes me wary to try North.  The mini cannolis had a very overpowering lemon flavor.  Cannolis are my favorite dessert....in my life I have had about 50 billion of them.  My wedding cake had cannoli filling.  I have never had lemon flavored cannoli before. It was half gross and mostly disgusting.  The chocolate and hazelnut \"cake\" was really a brownie in the shape of pie with a lot of whipped cream and some hazelnuts on top.  Not quite what I was expecting.  The drink selection is pedestrian as is the beer and wine selection.  Then there is the water.  Holy cow I felt like I was drinking a glass of the chemicals my parents put in their pool.  It smelled awful and tasted absolutely disgusting.  I forced it down but oh man, they need to adjust their water filter.  Its all open seating according to the server we ran into on the way in.  Although when we made the move to a newly open table we were told it was reserved.  What is it? Open or reserved?  Once we got a spot on the patio we were treated to parents letting their children run through the fountain at Kierland at 10pm.  I don't know...when I was 7 years old I wasn't running around crazy at 10pm at night.  (And I was most certainly not in Bar North after that having dessert and whatever.  Who brings a kid into a bar at 10pm on a Saturday night?!)   Then came time for the check.  We waited so long for our server to pick it up that I actually had to go to the bar and pay for it there.   All in all I was completely unimpressed.  Given the bizarre cannoli and the mediocre \"cake\" combined with the terrible service I'm not sure I would go back.....the only reason its getting the third star is because the pickings in North Scottsdale are slim."}
{"text":"Very slow service and they weren't very busy. Decent food. Very loud inside.  Nice patio when it isn't hot."}
{"text":"Came for Italian cuisine but fell in love with the atmosphere, between watching a determined Lebron battle the warriors, to chatting it up with a manager that goes above and beyond to make everything special, Gabriel has won my loyalty to this amazing restaurant and all future recommendations for Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with a group of 10.  We had made reservations, and they were ready for us at the appointed time, and sat us right away.  The restaurant is located in the Kierland Commons, an upscale shopping and dining area.  Parking can be a little challenging, but there is a parking structure on one end of the shopping area and walking around in the Commons is quite nice.  We were here on a Tuesday night, so the area was busy but not overly crowded.  I can imagine a weekend night could be a lot more crowded and parking could be a pain.  The restaurant is nice but not terribly large on the inside.  They do have patio seating as well.  The decor is nice, but the place is typical of current eateries in that it is very loud.  Really only possible to have a conversation with people immediately next or across from you.  Service was very good; our waiter was friendly, helpful, took time to explain and answer all questions, and he knew the menu very well.  He continued to be attentive throughout the meal without being intrusive.  The food was good, but I was not impressed given the upscale location and the prices.  I had the Pig pizza, which I would recommend, but it was $17 for a one person thin crust pie.  Salad was extra.  Speaking of the salad, it was also good, but again not memorable or what I'd call great.  Overall I liked my meal.  Most of my colleagues also enjoyed their meals, but a couple people had the chicken parm and mentioned it was dry and over-cooked.  I'd probably try other places nearby before returning to North Italia.  But still I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for an Italian meal."}
{"text":"I wish I didn't have to give a rating on this but Yelp needs me to do so.  I wont give this one star.  Worst place to eat.  When we get there I let them know we have a reservation, they look for it and can't find it.  So the hostess says to me you must of called another restaurant very snotty...excuse me.  then why when I hit the button for directions it gave me directions to this place?  My husband gently grabs my arm he knows me all to well.  He asks if there is any available seating.  We are told on the heated patio.  Ok fine.  The hostess comes around to show us the way and she is wearing a dress that is just a tad longer than a shirt, IT BARELY COVERS THINGS.    The waiters are dressed in jeans and tshirts.  Normally I would not complain about stuff like this however when you look at the price of the steak and the menu the steak is $35 you expect some sort of aviance/atmosphere.  This place did not have it.  So we get to our seats and there are no tables in \"HEATED\" portion of the patio they plan to stick us as far away as possible from any heater....I refused to sit there and surprisingly enough there was another table closer to the heated area but honestly we are still exposed to the cold weather.  I had to eat with my winter coat on.  Food was OK nothing real special somewhat limited menu.  I asked for a hot vanilla Latte since we were so cold.  No Vanilla so I did without.  While I was there I had to use the restroom.  There are 5 restrooms that either man or lady can use each their own stall.  I go inside and I turn to close the door behind me and there is no handle to grab to pull the door shut. So I push it open and hope it would slam closed...nope.  I ended up grabbing the coat hook on the back of the door so I could completely close the door and lock. The parking lot is very small and its only complimentary valet.   Its also very hard to walk on if you have heels on like I did.  By the way our reservation was at 6pm We should of just turned around and walked out.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"I loved the flavors created in each dish. The wait staff was friendly and courteous. I would return for more of the chicken Pesto"}
{"text":"Great place to have lunch with friends!   Menu has something for everyone!  Very good service ....Bonnie is great! They don't rush you so you can enjoy the food and your friends! Great place for Happy Hour because they have small plate selection too!    Love the green ice tea!"}
{"text":"Brand new, great food, service was fantastic! Sit at the bar and ask for Tacey;, she took fantastic care of us!   Lemon donuts- yes! Prosciutto bruschetta- yes! Homemade pasta- yes, yes! Half off bottles of wine on Sunday FTW!  It is a restaurant from a restaurant group, so we were concerned. They really have an attention to detail and it was above and beyond what we expected."}
{"text":"What a fun place to go lots of gluten-free friendly choices. The place is loud and buzzing everybody's happy the service is at 10 the food is yummy keep up the good work"}
{"text":"I've been living in Phoenix for over 20 years and let me tell you that this is one of the best places you can ever go to. The food is amazing and their service is even more amazing. The people here are the best. I recommend everything on the menu. So far I have not been disappointed. FYI their tiramisu is the BEST!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times prior to my Yelp affiliation.  This is a great chill spot.  The scene is very much a group gathering spot for sure.  Very open and inviting.   I sat at the bar and Shane the bartender is a really nice guy who was very happy to let me taste all the various Italian wines.  It kills me after all these years of knowing wines I still am amiss when it comes to placing just the right kind of Italian red.  No matter, Shane was very hospital and patient.    The bruschetta  was amazing! It paired very nicely with my chianti.  I saw many ordering the cheese plate but it would've been too much for just 1 person.  But looked amazing.  They really know what they are doing here.    Definitely check it out.  Great spot."}
{"text":"Just ate there last night and once again the food is delicious. My favorite is the calamari, crisp and tasty actually the best I've eaten in Vegas. While the beer tap was giving them problems, management made sure we were kept abreast of the situation until it was fixed. Great example of good customer relations. The abundant wait staff are friendly and courteous. Another of my favorites in this neighborhood that is loaded with good eateries."}
{"text":"North is our new favorite place to eat! I have been here twice so far, once for a girlfriend's bachelorette party...and then took my husband there for a date for the two of us because I enjoyed it so much!  Both times I had the red sangria and the Tuscan Kale salad. I could eat that salad everyday of my life and it was never get old. Seriously its the bomb!!! So fresh! Sundays they have happy hour all day which is super nice. We tried their pizza of the day and it was amazing! Hands down some of the best food I've ever had. Our waiter Aaron was awesome! We will definitely be back and love telling friends about it. North is doing something right!"}
{"text":"Hands down phenomenal service with a smile along with the best dishes - not leaving a single bite left in the plate. Started with steamed mussels $12, then the Italian farm salad (salami, green olives, roasted red peppers, tomato, cucumber, mixed greens, provolone cheese and Italian vinaigrette) on a bruschetta board $12, and finished with the medium rare NY strip entree $34. Too full for dessert. I love coming here!! Valet service was great!"}
{"text":"North Italia serves some of the best spaghetti this side of the Pacific--and I haven't even told you about the pizza yet!   Every menu item that I've had, from the salads to the hand-made pastas to the pizzas, has left me feeling unbelievably satisfied. The attentive customer service adds to this experience and has made me, a small shrimp in an enormous pond, feel more at home.   This restaurant is perfect for date night, dinner with friends, or a family outing. Go for it and enjoy some modern Italian flair.   Tl; dr: North Italia tickled my tongue and my mood in the best way."}
{"text":"Came to North after a disappointing experience at The Henry with 6 of my friends.  Update to the ladies: the flooring situation is still treacherous, however the hardwood interior seems to have lost some of its shine.   After briefly discussing our bad experience at The Henry the waitress thanked us for coming in and made some suggestions including the zucca chips (which we ate 4 bowls of!).  They have some great HH specials at North including a bottle of wine and a pizza for $20!  When the manager noticed our Zucca chips had been dished slightly low he brought an entire extra bowl for the table... what service.  We really had a great time here tonight chatting with the Manager, the servers and each other.  I sincerely feel that any mistake during the dining experience can be overcome by a smile, explanation and apology which was evident tonight when a pizza came out a little late.   I wish I had asked his name but Sam Fox needs to retain this awesome manager; he clearly pitches in, leads by example and was extremely involved in the dinner service.  The patio is beautiful, the food is amazing, and we saw two separate traffic accidents which was crazy.    I enjoyed an AMAZING piece of salmon which I had asked to be cooked well.  It was perfect which I especially appreciate since chef's can sometimes hesitate to overcook fish (which is how I prefer it).  I loved the grain it was served on and the lemon olive oil drizzle just iced the cake.  A friend enjoyed a toffee dessert which was to die for, and since we were celebrating the manager even brought out a celebratory dessert for us to share.    I HIGHLY recommend North for a romantic night out or for HH with friends!"}
{"text":"I got to stop in here recently for lunch while visiting Phoenix, and I was definitely impressed. Thankfully, I was with a large group and I got to sample a chunk of the menu because everything was delicious!  I definitely suggest starting with the bruschetta. The ingredients were fresh, and the portions were large. I also had the arancini and the asparagus pizza. It's hard to go wrong with the arancini, balls of risotto in a nice red sauce, and the pizza had a good crust and ingredients with the egg on top also making it unique. Add in some red sangria with this and you have all the making for an amazing lunch.  In addition, we had a large group and the service was always prompt and friendly. I'm so happy I got to try this place!"}
{"text":"We went to the North Italia in Tucson 8 years ago. It was wonderful.   So we were back in Tucson a few weeks ago, and again had dinner there. Another excellent meal, with outstanding service.   They told us there was now a North, here in Las Vegas.   We went there this past Tuesday. What a disappointment!  The people were just going through the motions of service. While running by us, they asked how we were doing, without listening for a response.   Plus we both ordered pasta dishes. They were terrible. I would rather go to Olive Garden.  Plus, with how bad the food was, it was pretty expensive. I would not mind the cost at all, if the service and food were anywhere near the quality of their Tucson branch.   I would strongly suggest going to a different restaurant for Italian food!"}
{"text":"I had North the other night with a couple of friends and it was DELICIOUS to say the least! We shared the chefs board and the garlic bread (you can't leave here without getting the garlic bread) and different pastas. I tasted a little of everyone's and they were all yummy. The tiramisu is also my favorite! Our waitress, Nicole took great care of us and I'll definitely be coming back to show more of my friends this place!"}
{"text":"Good pizza and friendly staff. The patio has a nice ambiance that isn't as mall like as you might think. The crowd lacks some of the diversity in age and culture that I like."}
{"text":"Amazing food & service.  Such a cute and quaint restaurant.  The hostesses were so welcoming and friendly.  Makes all the difference when you enter and it sets the tone.  Terrific training.    The Chefs Board, Kale Salad, House Speciality - Bolognese was spectacular as was the Calamari & Shrimp Squid Ink Pasta.  Phenomenal, efficient, attentive and warm service by Gabriel.    The Bomboloni and the Affogato were also fabulous.   A great addition to the area mall.  Thank you for a wonderful lunch.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Mediocre experience at best.  Barely any chicken on chicken sandwich-they wouldn't know because the bartender doesn't even ask how my meal is.  She did give me ketchup when I asked.  I guess I should be thankful,  right?"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Always go for Sunday lunch, and Happy hour all day Sunday.  Good house white wine and all the food is fantastic.  In winter I eat the Pasta, in the summer salad and daily pizza.  Gelato is also out of this world with different flavors all the time.  Servers all are friendly and hostesses alway ready to greet you.  Never have any thing to say negative about North."}
{"text":"I had lunch at North Italia for the first time. I enjoyed sitting outside on a patio. My kale salad was very good. It was a tad salty because there was so much cheese on it. My friend had a hamburger on a delicious bun. She enjoyed it. The server was friendly and helpful. I noticed they had gluten free pasta and pizza crust. I plan to return."}
{"text":"We came here tonight as a little bit of a bigger party  during prime time so I understand that things may not happen \"picture perfect\".   I had dined at the restaurant before and it was my Mom's birthday and she had heard good things so she decided to come here, though she had never tried it before.   This is one of the many reasons that I love Fox restaurants... If anything is ever not right, they will fix it... Always so hospitable. Even though there was just a slight misunderstanding, management was so apologetic and compensating.   Food was amazing & we will definitely be returning and will highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Recently came here on a double date with another couple & this place is one of our favorite fox concept restaurants.  It's our \"must-go\" place for dinner whenever our friend visits from out of town. We come here quite often that we routinely order our \"usuals\".  Our couple friend always gets the spaghetti & meatballs which our friend claims \"is the best spaghetti & meatballs ever\", margherita pizza and the gluten free bolognese pasta. As for my boyfriend & I, we usually share the \"pig\" pizza & Italian farm salad. Oh and of course, to complete our amazing meal, us four will share a pitcher of their delicious & refreshing red sangria.  I'm usually not a fan of red wines but this is one that I love.   So if you haven't tried this place...definitely DO!!! It's a great place to hang out with friends or a nice date.  And did I forget to mention that they have happy hour all day Sunday!!!...can't beat that."}
{"text":"My last review was very negative because they experienced a bad weekend. Since then, the manager has really spiffed up service - the food only gets better with their friendly and helpful service!  I recommend their sausage and kale soup and Italian paninis. I can't wait for when the weather warms up as the restaurant has a wonderful patio."}
{"text":"We came for the soft opening and had such a delicious meal here,  we can't wait to come back! There were 3 of us and we all loved everything we tried. We ordered the Italian meatballs and burrata for starters and both were fantastic. For entrees, we tried the Chicken Parmesan, bolognese pasta and roasted salmon. All were excellent and very generous portions. For dessert we tried the hazel nut torta  and the salted caramel budino and couldn't decide which we loved more! The service was impeccable and the restaurant had a cool vibe to it. This will definitely be a go-to Restaurant whenever we are looking for great Italian food!"}
{"text":"The Raddiatori pasta with short rib is a favorite I loved the texture of the noodles and sauce beef was cooked just right.  Boyfriend ordered the short rib dinner and he didn't talk much so it must've been good LOL!   We munched on zucchini chips and sipped on Terrazas Malbec. Andrew was a respectful server as he made suggestions on what to order but wasn't intrusive during our conversation. I love a knowledgable and respectful server.   Great place to hang out with friends enjoy loud music great service and delicious food."}
{"text":"North Italia restaurant is major fail! We made reservation and was the second party to be seated. They sat more than 10 other tables and they all got servers/drinks. We complained to host and still no service. Some walked around to scan tables and no one came to us. Even the manager walked around, saw it, and didn't see it.  We got up and walked out.   This is the first time anything like this has happened in our many years of dining out!"}
{"text":"Might have been the best meal I have had in a long time. We had three appetizers and they are all amazing - zucchini chips, the artichoke and truffle bread. I had the best salad - delicious!   We finished with olive cake and a cappuccino! So delicious!   We will go back soon!!"}
{"text":"Came for a HH and stayed for dinner.  I really enjoy the atmosphere (minus the fact that it was very warm and a little too loud), but I really like walking in and seeing the large windows and open kitchen.  It's almost like walking in to fancy barn or greenhouse with tables inside!  Tables can be put together to accommodate large crowds and the service was very good.    We ordered a pizza that had mozzarella, eggplant and garlic, and the malfadine (rock shrimp, home made pasta, delicious!) which were both very good.  Hopefully they'll fix their air conditioning issue (or maybe I'll just wait to go when it's not 118 outside!).  But I'll be back for some more fresh Italian goodness.  Note: there is no parking, and is valet only, but at least its complimentary!"}
{"text":"I've had 3 memorable Italian meals in my life. The first was in Florence at a restaurants called ZaZAs where I ordered a delicious pasta and chicken dish wish a side of seared Brussel sprouts (which I hate unless they're drowned in butter and garlic).  The second was the same exact meal the next day for lunch because it was so amazing. The third to my surprise was at North Italia.   I didn't expect to have such a mouth watering meal but was surprised with everything that was ordered. The meatballs which I never order at a restaurant because mom makes them best completely put hers to shame. I ordered the chicken Parmesan for the main course and it was the best I've ever had, handmade pasta and perfectly cooked chicken on top.  I cleaned the plate and even though I was stuffed I was so impressed with dinner that I needed to try dessert. I ordered the tiramisu which is usually my go to for an Italian sweet tooth and it was fresh and the perfect combo of chocolate, espresso, and cream.   Our waitress Melissa was awesome as well, great food and great service.   I'll be going  back tomorrow for lunch to continue the trend of amazing Italian meals."}
{"text":"Walked in off the street no problem! Pros Friendly helpful staff Lovely tables both inside and out - we chose out! Food excellent Wine list good Cons - none"}
{"text":"Another amazing meal at north!  Our waiter Jonathan was attentive and super knowledgable. He put up with my quirks and made my birthday extra special! Thank you"}
{"text":"My wife and I made reservations at 6pm and was informed that since it was Valentine's Day there would be a limited prefixed menu, which we agreed to.  We ordered our drinks and food at approximately 6:15-6:20 and our server was consistently checking up on us when we received our drinks and appetizers, which was nice (received appetizers at 6:26, time stamp from photo of appetizers I took).  After we finished our appetizers, we noticed she was checking up on her other tables and hadn't been by, which is fine since we were waiting for our main course.  As it seemed like we were waiting a long time for our main course after receiving our appetizers, I checked my phone and it was 7:11pm.  We kept trying to get our servers attention to ask about the status of our main course, but before we got our server's attention our main course came out at 7:12 (time stamp from photo of main course I took).  After we finished our main course, a food runner brought out one Tiramisu which we ordered and one Panna Cotta which we did not order, we told them that we ordered the Salted Caramel Budino so he took it back.  Our server came by and asked us how our dessert was and she told us that they ran out of Salted Caramel Budino and that Panna Cotta is similar to it, while the server was at our table the food runner came back with the Panna Cotta again and said it was going to be a 15 minute wait for the Salted Caramel Budino, which we were agreed to wait for.  We waited approximately two minutes and a Salted Caramel Budino was brought out to us.  It is unusual that you limit the customer to a prefix menu and then inform them that by 7:30 one of their items is out.  I understand things run out, but I would have thought that our server would inform us that the Salted Caramel Budino is out and ask us if we wanted an alternative dessert instead of deciding for us and bringing out the Panna Cotta, without an explanation.  I saw other tables with other dessert items such as the Bombolini, which were not even offered to us.  Overall the food was excellent, however the service and communication could have been improved.  Our main course took longer than we would expect from a limited prefix menu and if our order was placed late, we should of had some communication from our server instead of avoiding us until our main course came out.  We noticed the table next to us arrive at least 45 minutes after us and they received their main course before we did.  As I said before, the food was excellent, but the service and communication could be greatly improved especially when the menu is a limited prefix menu."}
{"text":"Great ambience with 2 different rooms and an outdoor seating area paired with string lights.  Appetizers 1. Chef board - a nice variety of cheeses, prosciutto, pine nuts, asparagus, and fig.  Perfect to snack on with wine 2. Crispy calamari - calamari over a bed of arugula   Entrees 1. pizza - the combination of prosciutto, goat cheese, and arugula was delicious  2. Strottopezza (?) - Their homemade pasta was soft and made to perfection.    The whole combination together was yummy, but I wished there was a little bit more sauce  3. Spinach tortellini - so yummy, I recommend it if you want something light"}
{"text":"So happy to have another option in our great restaurant rich neighborhood. The space is much larger than it appears from the street, and is broken up really well into comfortable areas. The open kitchen really does have an Italian country feel, and the lighting gives the very large open room a warm feel. Nice large bar as well. Best of all is the number of walls that open up to the outside-perfect for this time of year. Our server had the perfect combination of personality and humor-not too much, just right. The menu has a great selection, no matter your appetite. The Burratta was nice and creamy, with a nice compliment of apple slices and Rocket. The potatoes with parmesan, rosemary and perfect lemony aioli were off the chain. I wanted an order to take home! Pizza crust is very tasty and perfect texture. Hanger steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The brunch menu looks super yummy-we definitely have a new hangout on the hood. Great job, Sam Fox!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian dishes that rival Nora's here on the west side of the strip.  The calamari appetizer has a different spin than most with a light tempura batter and a lemon glaze that gives it more zip than your usual plain breaded calamari app.  Was a big fan of it.  Comes on a bed of arugula for some extra greens.  I love me some arugula.   We also split the prosciutto Pizza which was I thought was really good, but nothing to rave about...BUT my girlfriend thought it was the best pizza she had ever had in her life.  She's a big fig fan and a lover of prosciutto.  The goat cheese always makes everything good.    The missus got the chicken pesto and despite my waiter telling me that my order of short rib radiatori was his favorite by far, I have to say that the chicken pesto was on par.  It was really good.  The Sauce us heavy leaving you feeling full and satisfied...and guilty.   My short rib radiatori was just like the chicken pesto.  Excellent.  Very filling and satisfying.  A heavy dish for sure.    Desserts were both really good.  Tiramisu (hard for tiramisu to be bad, no?) and a hazelnut torta I think it was.    A great new Italian addition to summerlin.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended North, and it did not disappoint. Cool vibe & great ambiance. We started with their \"signature\" appetizer, the \"Zuc chips\" ( deep fried zucchini chips ). They were thin, delicate and delicious. I hade the Kale salad, which was packed with tasty and healthy ingredients. My wife had the \"Simple salad\", she said it was \"simply\" delicious. She particularly enjoyed the inclusion of toasted pine nuts.  My main course was the Rosemary chicken. It was perfectly prepared, moist, tender and very tasty. My wife had pan seared scallops, which she thoroughly enjoyed. Service was great, our waiter was attentive without being obtrusive, he answered all our questions and helped with insightful suggestions to help us make our delicious decisions. We'll definitely make North a regular stop on any future trips to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I come to North Italia all the time! This place is great ! They have two locations Arcadia and north Scottsdale . My usual order is artichoke appetizer, kale salad , squid ink pasta, strozapretti pasta and Juliette as cocktail! Love it ! Always a good time with friendly service!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Super friendly staff with great recommendations. I got the pasta with ribs in it. (Can't remember the official name) but my goodness it was off the charts. I love good food and this just made my whole day. Super good flavor, good appetizers, great environment. I'd move to Arizona so I could eat here more often.   I'd give 6 stars if I could. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food with competent waiter and attention to detail. Complimentary valet parking on site. We started with a bowl of zuca chips and arancini. The tomato sauce it rich tangy and a hint of fennel, so good we regret not getting a tomato pasta dish as an entree. My husband had a short rib and horseradish cream sauce pasta. The daily fresh housemade pasta is in a realm of its own. I could not decide between the short rib entree and the scallops with sweet corn (I've been disappointed with fishy tasting scallops at other restaurants) the waiter took  the time to describe in detail how the scallops are sourced etc. I went with the short ribs and the chef obliged to make a small taste of the scallop dish for me which made my day!! I would have ordered it in a whole entree. Fresh and no fishy taste or smell. The corn risotto is to die for. My short rib entree was a tad salty but good, exactly like the short ribs from the greenehouse restaurant in Scottsdale. We had the doughnuts with lemon curd for dessert and it was the perfect balance not too tart. We will come back!"}
{"text":"Great little Italian bistro. Had the crispy calamari which was amazing. For lunch it was the grilled salmon and grilled cauliflower. It is good for lunch or dinner for two inside  or on the patio. The service good and so it the food, but $20 lunches are tough to swallow."}
{"text":"Service was okay  both times I have been here. The food is good. I would rather have great food and with okay service but unfortunately I received good food with bad service.  The atmosphere is cool And I will Give it a third chance."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service.. They seated us and forgot us altogether.. After half hour i went to talk to d attendant that nobody has come to our table for half hr. After that it took another 5 min for them to come just when we were abt to leave..The first attendant merely apologised once and was more interested in getting it over with.  The table got reassigned to another server and second server was decent in service.  I had to tip low. I never do that but overall dining experience was horrible enough for me to tip low and my wife objected to low tip but i explained my reasons to the server and just left after a quick dinner. Manager or someone senior never bothered to come to talk to us during our dinner."}
{"text":"We and our kids love North!  Zucchini chips, chicken parm, spaghetti, and lunch salads are great!  Patio is lovely on a nice evening.  We go every few months.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Very noisy with limited menu. Good appetizers, love the Zucca chips."}
{"text":"North Italia could have been a bit better.  We booked a reservation for 6:15 but ended up being seated at 6:30, which is fine (they were very busy) but they could be more prepared.  The appetizers and salads were perfect (5/5), and our waiter was excellent.  After that it started going down hill; the pasta did not taste fresh and was a little bit mushy.  They also messed up my order which they fixed in a quick manner.  They offered free desert for their mistake and were very apologetic.  The food was very good and the waiter was awesome.  I would recommend coming here if you want some good Italian food!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant the other night, got lucky and sat at the bar . We had the grilled artichokes that were delicious and I'm still thinking about, we also had the pizza margarita which was so delicious and definitely in my top five best pizzas, and then we had the chicken pesto pasta which was good but not comparable to the other items we had."}
{"text":"Love this place! The atmosphere is beautiful, romantic and comfortable. I love the clean design and the open kitchen. I've been here 4 or 5 times, and have had a great experience every time! It's a little pricey (except during happy hour -- that's a STEAL!), but it's to be expected for this type of restaurant. That said, I've pretty much only been here for special occasions or happy hour (because of price). The Zucca Chips, Tuscan Kale Salad and Salted Caramel Budino are all winners in my book!"}
{"text":"We have not been here in quite a while, because it has gone downhill. We used to eat here ALL THE TIME. I am vegetarian, so I would always get the spaghetti marinara, the beet salad, and probably three glasses of Barbera. The last time we went, the spaghetti marinara had been taken off of the menu, so I just got the beet salad. Unfortunately, it was nothing like what I ordered in the past, and was WAY overdressed to the point of being inedible. They do have an arancini appetizer that is vegetarian, but I really miss their spaghetti marinara, it was the reason I went there. Such a disappointment.  Went back last night because the manager responded to my review and told me I can still get the spaghetti marinara. I ordered it and it was amazing as always. Had a lovely evening out with ma man, vino, and good conversation.  So we went back a while back, and yes, I got the spaghetti marinara, and it was terrible. Flavorless. I really wish that restaurants would take vegetarian and vegan dishes as seriously as they take their other food. We like good food too. If I owned a restaurant, I would see to it that every menu item was exceptional. If they don't know what good vegan/vegetarian food tastes like, they should consult with vegans and vegetarians. I will not give this place another chance. I'm done."}
{"text":"The Zucca chips are delicious and it's a veggie- can't loose there! The Italian Farm salad is fantastic. For an entree I highly recommend the strozzapreti. If you like Kale salads it is great here with the salmon. I admit potatoes are a weakness but their smashed potatoes (not mashed but smashed) are great!"}
{"text":"Not only was the vibe of this restaurant on point but the food was so good! The service was also good! I definitely recommend this spot for a casual dinner or even a date night."}
{"text":"I recently need a last minute reservation for dinner for a big party, and North did a great job accommodating us.  Larissa, the GM, made sure we had enough spots, and we had great service.  The space is very cool and modern, with a totally open floor plan that gives it a nice \"hustle and bustle\" feel.  The staff were very professional, always serving all the ladies before the men.  The food was also good, with the bolognese being terrific, as always."}
{"text":"Great service!  But the food was SUPURB! Everything was fresh, hot and fast. Will be a go to place."}
{"text":"Beautiful venue, delightful menu, professional waitstaff make for a perfect feat dining experience. Thank you to Kaye, manager, and Bryan, our server, for an exceptional experience. Our salmon was superb, our prosciutto bruschetta was divine! Come and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Great food. The meatballs were delicious. Fantastic service! Great environment. We go at least once per month."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  Ingredients are fresh, service is friendly and efficient, and nothing beats sipping a glass of wine on their patio after a long day of shopping.  The salads are always a good bet, as are the pizzas.  Also, make sure you get the focaccia and sundried tomato butter--delish!"}
{"text":"Very good lunch for me. Surly pasta with optional grilled scallops on top. I thought our waitress was very good and very friendly. Bread and red spread very good. Beer selection maybe could be better in the restaurant. Don't like the McDonald type layout of seating but creates a quicker turnover I guess. I talk a little loud sometimes so I embarrassed myself a few times since the tables are close. Will be back"}
{"text":"Just posted some of our favorites dishes from last night.  Absolutely amazing and service was on point!"}
{"text":"Zucca chips are great. Had two orders!! The service was a good however it took a long time to get our food. It was a Saturday night and packed.  Still a good time and great food. Had the spaghetti and meatballs.  Also tried the chicken parm, was very good. The pasta was great and the drinks were stiff."}
{"text":"Can you say fresh dough?  All the pizza dough and pasta is made in house! And is so yummy!!!  Italia north is located between Honey Salt and Pottery Barn in the Rampart Commons plaza.  Walking up they have a large open air patio with a fireplace and overhead fans and heaters.   We ate here with some friends on opening night and the place was busy yet organized.  As a carb-lovin vegetarian I really liked the White Truffle Garlic Bread with house made ricotta but also the Burrata with winter squash was beautifully plated with lots of toasted hazelnuts.   The Burrata Tortelloni was surprisingly light and served with a roasted mushroom, swiss chard, and porcini broth. Our waiter highly recommended this saying it's his favorite pasta on the menu, and I have to agree it was very good."}
{"text":"Really could go 2 or 4 stars on this, but the overall experience was a 3 star.  The positive:  Great service, excellent cocktails, spouse dinner was spot on (tortellini), desert (dark Chocolate) was fantastic, nice location, unique offerings, and the calamari is a must.  The negative:  Extremely loud environment, very crowded (my chair got bumped by workers/patrons at least 6x), my dinner was blah (slow cooked short ribs), very dark had to use phone to read menu (has many others did too).  In fact the couple in the table next to us practically sitting in our lap were kind enough to even keep shining it in our eyes.  Considering the price and list of negatives I would rather go to Babbo's, Romanelli's, or Giussipe's on 28th."}
{"text":"My friend and I came in today. I'd seen reviews for this place on Yelp and convinced him to try it. It was a Tuesday mid-afternoon so not too busy. The hostess was super friendly, the ambiance was nice-not stuffy. The outdoor patio looked super inviting and cozy. We opted to sit inside because it was windy and chilly. Our server (I wish I remembered her name) came straight over and took our drink orders. She was friendly and gave us several suggestions throughout our meal. I wanted to try both pizza and pasta, so My firiend and I ordered a pizza to share to start and each ordered our own pasta dish. We chose the Pig pizza-pepperoni, sausage and soppressata. It came out quickly and was hot and delicious! The crust was perfect and the sauce just right. The pepperoni had some heat to it. It was perfect. My friend even said that it was the best pizza he'd ever had. Next, we decided to order some calamari. It came on a bed of arugula with a lemony vinaigrette on top. It was perfectly cooked. Crispy on the outside and tender inside. Yum! We ordered our pasta (even though at this time we were getting stuffed!).  I ordered their specialty the Bolognese and my friend ordered the Strozzapretti pasta. They were both outstanding. We decided that we needed to try the dessert, so we both had a couple bites of our pastas and decided to box the leftovers. Our sweet waitress suggested the Budino for dessert (a salted caramel pudding like dessert). Wow! It was amazing. I was tempted to lick the jar but held back. Lol! All in all, it was an excellent meal and we both agreed that we would be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"North Italia is an absolute gem!!!! My friends and I stopped at North on Saturday afternoon for a refreshing adult beverage while we were on a leisurely bike ride. We sat at the outside bar which was perfect for a quick stop. The Strawberry Moscow Mule was delicious and super refreshing!! Our server was nice and attentive. It may sound weird, but the bathrooms were great!... Private, roomy, and clean. The modern farmhouse atmosphere of North was so charming. The next time I'm in town (from Denver) I'll return for lunch or dinner. Our friends who live in Paradise Valley said the food is outstanding. I highly recommend a stop at North!!!"}
{"text":"I came here this past Sunday night and I was very impressed!!  The experience was just great.  Right when we walked in, they had a table for us. They explained the menu and the concept of the restaurant.    A beautiful large bar in the front and an open kitchen towards the back made the restaurant look very big and open.  Loved the uniforms of the servers and bartenders too.   Their special Drinks were so yummy and the menu looked great. We ordered the short ribs and the scallops and they all tasted amazing. My favorite was the mussels on the appetizer menu.   Our server was also so sweet. I apologize for not remember her name because I really should of.  I've already ranted this place to my friends.    I will definitely be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"For a Tuesday night this was one popular spot! We had reservations for a party of 4 at 7:15, but our reservation time came and went while we were waiting at the bar. We probably would have waited even longer if one member of our party hadn't taken it upon himself to seat us at an empty table he spotted.  We followed his lead and took our seats at the table...and soon were greeted by a friendly waiter.  Thank goodness because after a long plane trip from Florida to Arizona I was starving!!    I soon had lots of food to alleviate the pains of hunger. We started with NoRTH's infamous zucca chips for the table, as well as a pizza.  The zucca chips were fabulous- a must while dining at NoRTH!   As for my entree I ordered the scallops, which came on top of orzo.  Our waiter suggested I also add a few shrimps to the dish as well, which didn't turn out to be such a great idea because the shrimp was way overcooked. I can eat shrimp for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but these were inedible! The scallops, on the other hands, were cooked to perfection and the orzo was pretty tasty as well.  We also ordered a side of organic veggies.  I'm not usually a veggie lover, but if veggies were always this good I'd be eating them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner instead of the shrimp!  I wasn't blown away by the service and/or the food, but the wine list did look very inviting so I'd be willing to go back for a drink when back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere. Our waiter Alexander was very knowledgeable and friendly. The food was off the charts. I recommend the tomato heirloom salad and any one of the pasta dishes. We will be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"I'm starting to feel a special connection with Sam Fox just from eating at so many of his restaurants. One of his latest and greatest creations...NoRTH.  Apparently this used to be the location of a car wash, but you'd never know by the cool modern decor. It was pretty packed for an early dinner on a week night, but my party of 4 was lucky to score a table right away.  I'd recommend skipping the calamari because it was pretty disgusting, but the rest of our order was pretty awesome. Favorites including the zucca chips, meat and cheese plate and the spinach tortelloni. My goodness was that spinach tortelloni good. My buddy Sam knew what he was doing when he put that on the menu.  Actually based on my experiences in Phoenix Sam knows what he's doing when it comes to any restaurant!"}
{"text":"Worthy of 4.5 stars.  I initially had attitude about going to a restaurant that is part of a group (Fox Concepts) but that was judging a book from the cover.   I love the restaurants on 40th street, several of good ones on that street (Chelsea's Kitchen, The Vig, La Grande Orange, this one).    We went there on a Sunday and it was packed.  Great vibe in the place.  Good decor - it is like a warehouse, open kitchen, etc.  Great happy hour prices and happy hour is all day on Sundays!!  Excellent bucatini with meatballs (homemade pasta) Castrevallano olives - delicious Italian ( not too briny)  Charcuterie & cheese plate with crusty fresh bread - very good Bottles of wine - half price during happy hour.  Service was outstanding.  We sat at the bar and the bartenders were attentive and continued to refill water glasses.  Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Great northern Italian fare at reasonable prices for the location which is an up scale town center of sorts.  The food comes hot and fast and has indepth flavors and appeal.    Well served and tasty.  The pasta is fresh made but does not over power the sauces.. yet the sauces are not heavy but instead well balanced and rich with delight."}
{"text":"I went for lunch with Melissa after her recommendation and those of my fellow Yelpers.  You know, I don't know that I'm sold...the zucchini chips were just okay to me and I thought their menu was somewhat limited actually.   As from previous lessons-a restaurant with mediocre food is a mediocre restaurant.  I almost feel bad giving it three stars as our waiter was just great but I don't even remember what I ordered and that equals forgettable food."}
{"text":"First  time in years.  Place was 3/4 full.  The menu was nice. Both appetizers were great especially the garlic bread.   I ordered the Chicken Parm.  Well it came our incinerated loaded with sauce and very tough.  I sent it back and the second one came out ok BUT it looked exactly like the first, Now if it was fresh pounded it would have been a bit uneven, it was a perfect +-1/4 inch, I perceive it was pre-made and frozen.  UGH.  My wife's pasta dish had interesting  components but was dry as my mother-in-laws bones and we had to order more white sauce.  The wine list was nice but $20 for 8 oz was decent.  Bottom line $130 for this low quality type of food, Spiga Marcellinos or Francos are a better bet"}
{"text":"Gluten Free Friendly!  Not only is the food here amazing every time we go (the zucca chips are my hubby's favorite and the salami/lentil soup is unbelievably good) but the staff is so helpful and informative. In November I was diagnosed with Celiac and have become a very nervous eater-outer. April, our server, could not have been more understanding and informative about what was gluten free as well as suggestions based upon what I like. I wish every dining experience had this sense of comfort. It was so much fun and felt like a regular dining out night for us - instead of having some special binder of what ingredients each dish have. April also knew, at a moments notice, what dishes contained gluten and which did not.   If you are looking for a relaxing and fabulous meal, go there! If you are looking also for an intelligent server who connects with their diners, go there AND ask for April!  She was so great and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite spots in Arcadia, especially on Sunday's. They have a great happy hour and it's happy hour all day on Sunday. This is a perfect spot to have some wine and apps and catch up with your friends. You may have to wait for a seat but it's well worth the wait and the wait staff is always awesome!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places for lunch!  The restaurant is always impeccably clean and I really love the valet parking.  I am addicted to the chicken sandwich with the smashed potatoes.  What a decadent dish this is...  it is just a perfectly composed sandwich.   The greens, the smoked mozzarella, apricot aioli... I dream about this sandwich at night.   Seriously.   You can order the sandwich with a side salad or the smashed potatoes, which comes with a mayo sauce with a hint of lemon.   Ohhhh.... love....  I've been there for dinner and had the New York strip.   This dish is amazing.   Perfectly prepared.   The appetizer boards are perfect for two people  The desserts are amazing as well.  I would highly recommend the salted caramel.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Yum, yum and more yum!  I haven't been to NoRTH for a couple of years, and was reaquainted with this delightful establishment today.  There were 4 in our party and everyone had a delish lunch!  The grilled artichokes are fabulous, and the salads wonderful!  I had the pasta with butternut squash and brussell sprouts and it was delish!  Excellent service, consistently good food and a lovely experience!"}
{"text":"Awesome Italian food..quaint table on the street great food...Wes was awesome...great..fantastic service."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday and holy moly was I glad I took a chance on NoRTH to make my bday fabulous.  This so far is my favorite Fox restaurant and one of my favs in all of the Phoenix area.  Everything we had there was excellent and cooked to perfection.   For apps: yucca chips and trio of dips AMAZING Entrees- Strazz-something chicken pasta, scallops, and New York.  AMAZING Desert- Nutella crepes- Not amazing but free since it was my bday! Service was excellent and they catered to our needs quickly and effectively.  We did not make a reservation for outside so when we decided we wanted to be outside they made the change and we were sat in 5 min.  Love this place.  Cant wait to get back and try more things!"}
{"text":"This place fulfilled all my pasta cravings! Love the ambiance and food, it makes for a great date night."}
{"text":"This place was so good! Came here to celebrate my friend's birthday and the overall experience went very well. We did not make reservation but the wait was not long at all for how packed they were. Our waitress was awesome! So friendly and informative, the whole wait staff was very attentive, drinks were constantly re-filled, food came out quick, dirty plates were promptly picked up, no complaints regarding service at all.   We started out with a few appetizers cuz friends were hangry! Grilled artichoke was good, dipping sauce was bomb! Garlic and truffle bread...need I say more? Must try. Grilled cauliflower was average, I didn't think it was worth $12, it was very sour and didn't have much flavor other than that.   Now the pastas...so so good! I got strozzapreti and even though my stomach was full my mouth wanted more! I never had pasta shaped like that also so it was a fun little surprise, the flavor was awesome, so cheesy but not overwhelming, great pasta dish! My friends got tortelloni and bolognese and both were delicious!   For dessert we got cheesecake, tiramisu and donuts and oh my lord! All were very good but the tiramisu was my favorite! It was one of the best tiramisu i have had in a long time!  Definitely recommend this place for date night or casual hang out. Nice vibe, lovely open kitchen concept, modern decor, and delicious food!"}
{"text":"My latest visit to North Italia showed me that they are greatly improving their service and it definitely shows.  You get the homemade taste in everything they make because they make everything there, including the pasta!  I just love it here and have now been back 5 times!  When you are there try the artichoke appetizer and make sure to request Bonnie as your server.  She provides excellent service in a warm and welcoming fashion!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things from my coworkers about this place so I was excited to come here. This place completely blew my mind. There was 6 of us and we ordered almost half the menu (some pictured, some not pictured) and I'm not kidding when I say each dish was delectable, delightful, and overall delicious...aka everything was orgasmic.   We ordered Italian meatballs, Chef's board, Crispy calamari, Arancini, Black Mediterranean mussels, Daily pizza (for the life of me I can't spell or remember the name but it had sausage, white sauce, broccolini, and garlic), Short rib radiatori, Roasted salmon, Italian farm salad, Squid ink mafaldine, and Strozzapreti. I highly recommend all of them. Just get them all! Haha.   For dessert we got hazelnut torta, affogato, and chocolate gelato. Again, just get them all! You won't regret any of them. The hazelnut torta was topped with salted caramel gelato and a piece of hazelnut toffee. I want to know if they sell the toffee in bulk because that was the most delicious piece of toffee I ever had.   Our server was TC (I hope I spelled it correctly). She was awesome! She reminds me of Bernadette from Big Bang Theory - sweet and knowledgeable...and she kinda looks like her too :)   Dress code is casual. Happy hour is Mon-Thurs from 4-6pm I believe.   I will definitely be back! I have my eye on the tiramisu next."}
{"text":"Everything is perfect, from the ambiance to the food. We were presently surprised at how well the menu was priced and how generous the servings were. Their food is by far one of the best Italian that I've had and having celiac disease, their gluten free pasta was to die for. We are already looking forward to going back and trying new things! (Pictured: Chicken Parm and Gluten Free Pesto Chicken with a side of grilled asparagus and Brussels sprouts)"}
{"text":"Excellent service, atmosphere & food! We started with arugula/calamari salad - EXCELLENT fresh taste! Homemade pasta, squid Ink Mafaldine - great experience."}
{"text":"Work offsites can be hit or miss, especially when it comes to after-conference activities and food, but North Italia delivered on expectations.   We had a group of about sixty (60) people attend, and there was never a moment where my wine glass was empty. However, when it came to the \"serve yourself\" salad and pizza during the middle of the gathering, there were moments where most had to wait for new pizzas to be made (I understand quality control), but once we waited, we ended up walking away with a single piece of pizza and one scoop of salad (little food, a ton of booze - you do the math.)  However, the staff themselves were incredibly friendly and personable, and service can make up for sub-par food delivery.  I will visit again, possibly on an actual dinner reservation."}
{"text":"I love this place! All the doors were open and the breeze flowing through the restaurant was perfect! I sat at the bar and the bartender recommended the perfect dinner for me. It started with artichokes & portabella mushroom bruschetta  . It was deli-sh and only $5. Dinner was seared sea scallops with mushroom risotto and arugula topped it off. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"I have had mostly wonderful experiences at North Italia. We tried it as soon as it opened, and were blown away by the awesome food, drinks, and service. My husband ordered the filet, and I ordered the short ribs on our first visit. We were both in heaven-- he says it's now his go-to steak in Vegas! (Also, pretty affordable for a filet at $38.) The flavors are great, the portions are perfect, and you really get your money's worth in my opinion on a normal day. I highly recommend the Arancini appetizer as well. Yum!   The one time our experience was less than perfect was on Valentine's Day. They had a pre-fixe menu at $55 per person, offering an appetizer, a main (5 featured entrees from their normal menu) and a dessert. Not bad, especially for the area. However, I ordered scallops and risotto which seemed under cooked. Service was really slow, as well. They also ran out of the desserts so we settled for gelato. I didn't feel like this particular special event was worth it.   Overall, on a normal day of service, I love North Italia but I don't think I would return for one of their pre-fixe events. I could also chalk it up to growing pains, as they only just opened and it was probably their first time doing something like that."}
{"text":"Another great addition in Boca park area.  Clean. Sleek. Great service. Fresh pasta. Great desserts.   Go hungry. Good size serving."}
{"text":"despite my best attempts to divert a visiting aunt from dining at this place, we ended up at NoRTH for dinner one evening.  the service is great, the location and ambience are nice too, but the food is just terrible. the appetizers and main dishes were really not tasty at all. i truly feel that the restaurant tries too hard to serve trendy spins on regular dishes. they just end up tasting gross.  come for drinks (those are great), but skip out before eating."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Mandy is the Best Ever. So nice and sweet to not only me as a customer but her coworkers. Sets the atmosphere for a great time with family and friends."}
{"text":"This was a great experience as we were first time diners here, celebrating a birthday!  Our waitress, Vanessa, was awesome and VERY attentive!  She was very patient to explain the seasonal and favorite dishes of the local patrons.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food...even better atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing and the food was fantastic. Had a great time such a nice atmosphere ."}
{"text":"North was a very very great place. The ambience was great! It's a big open area, but very intimate.   Our server was very quick and happy to serve us. I feel service besides the food is very important, bc if my service sucks my experience and appetite are lost.   The Artichoke I had was amazing and I had never had one! Incredible first experience and appetizer.  I had the steak and it was cook perfectly and very well seasoned.  I will be going back. It's very inviting!"}
{"text":"The three would be a five if I was commenting only on the excellent food.  The wine selections are not good and are extremely overpriced.  They have this whole do you want 6oz vs. 8oz of wine scam going on?  You end up paying a premium price for average wine served in highball rustic glasses.  Ambiance is great but someone needs to come in and totally revamp the wine situation there."}
{"text":"Went early  to North for the New Year's eve special menu. 3rd time dining here. They did not have to have great service or food on a yearly event, but as with the previous meals, it was outstanding. Hubby had the misto fritto, they always do the crisp calamari perfect. Enough just to make a special trip for it. I had the beef carpaccio, buttery and flavorful. The apple cider pork tenderloin was tender, moist and it was a huge portion. My hubby was stuffed but did not stop eating until it was all gone. Oink. I had the scallops. Always a favorite of mine. They usually have it on the menu and often in a variation as a special. We both had the hazelnut chocolate cake. Sinfully rich. We were both too full to eat but a bite and finished at home for the New Year's countdown.  We really enjoy our dining at North and have been very fortunate at several other Fox restaurants."}
{"text":"Love this place... It's a lighter more contemporary Italian.  The asparagus Bruchetta is amazing.  I travel across the country thinking of it often...  Great wine list, love the patio on a warm day... With a bottle of water the Bruchetta, maybe the rosemary chicken and vegetables for dinner... Great place to visit with friends. Upscale and casual all at once... And one ofvmy favorite from fox restraunt concepts..."}
{"text":"As always this place  was on point... you can never go wrong with a fox resteraunt.  We ordered family style... pancett bruchetta with the asparagus n cresenza cheese is bomb for an appy... also love the grilled  cauliflower... we get zucca chips usually (must have if you haven't tried) but we skipped this time... we also had chicken parm, roast chicken (super moist and perfectly seasoned), pepperoni pizza, and I think brisket or short ribs (it was meat) ... for desert we had salted caramel gggrrr had to bite a hand to get some, chocolate torte which had just a hint of maybe orange??? Amazing@@@ then finally olive oil cake with vanilla gelato orange and strawberry... kill me now that was to die for meal... as always Fox it was a pleasure from the valet to the hostess with the mostest to the waitress back to valet... keep up the excellence"}
{"text":"Delicious! Chick parm is delicious. Also the butter for the bread is a sun dried tomato that was awesome! There sandwichs and salads are amazing as well. I love seating on the patio with my girls and eating some good food! one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came on a date here last night and it was amazing! Katie had no idea it was my birthday and she still treated us like it was. She's a wonderful waitress with great recommendations!   We had the black mediterranean mussels to start. For dinner we enjoyed the squid ink mafaldine and the red wine glazed short ribs. Both were amazing and drinks were the cherry on top (rosè and a red sangria for me). Thanks to Katie and my boyfriend for a great birthday dinner. :) We'll be back."}
{"text":"The food is great here... We love it. But the last 3 times, the service and time to receive our food was so slow. We wait forever! Tonight the waitress placed the wrong order, she brought me the Bolognese but I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. I waited over 15 minutes for my spaghetti meatballs to come the rest of the table have finished their food. They took it off the bill, only after my mother-in-law insisted on them taking it off the bill. It was a mistake on their part not mine, I shouldn't of had to wait for a meal that long.eat after the rest of my party was finished and then still pay for my meal."}
{"text":"My tastebuds were awaken this evening! The grilled cauliflower and truffle garlic bread started off our wonderful culinary experience. The branzino was exactly what I was craving plus more. Dessert was just perfect, the hazelnut gelato combined with the salted caramel budino ended our dinner on a great note!"}
{"text":"Love North! I'm a frequent diner, especially enjoying: chef's board, shrimp mafaldine with salmon added, numerous pizzas, coffees, and desserts! Fun ambiance inside and out on the patio, TVs with sound off if I want to peak at a sporting event. Helpful, friendly hostesses and wait staff. Great for he adults and teenagers in my household. Complimenti! Keep up the great work, Sam Fox and your team at North!"}
{"text":"Last night dinner was amazing. The food was delicious, and the service was great   It was our first time there and we were amazed. The place was packed on a Thursday night. Good thing we got reservation. We would definitely go back to try more food."}
{"text":"Nothing special, while the entrees were good, the service was lackluster at best. Soup and meals came out at same time. No bread & olive oil or butter up front, an Italian must. Predominately geared at the millennial drinking crowd. Nice patio area, but the interior has all the ambiance of a bowling alley, just another cold chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Loved their service. We came here and wanted to try different things and they were more than happy to split our entrees for us. We got their mussels and calamari and that started our meal out on a high note. We got the squid ink pasta and the short ribs. Highly recommend the short ribs!!!! They were tender and the flavor was definitely unforgettable (as in I would get this again and again!) Our dessert was a Salted caramel tart and it was really delicious and not too sweet. Needless to say we will be back"}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere!  The bolognese is hard to beat and the prices are very reasonable.  It can get a little loud inside on the weekend, but it's a fun crowd."}
{"text":"Nice lunch spot- dinner next time!  Trendy fun afternoon atmosphere. This would be a great date night before the movies.   Great service, good food! My mom & I really enjoyed the pizza! Next time we wanna try a fish dish - that looked amazing!  We will be back.. I have a feeling there is many more things  we will love!"}
{"text":"I will start out by admitting I judge harshly. That being said, the main reason I give it such a low rating is the mussels were spoiled! I love mussels with a nice piece of bread to soak up the juice. But if the cooks didn't smell the fowl smell these dead mussels were giving off, then they should not be in the kitchen. I'm not the one who ordered them, so it wasn't my place to send them back or complain, and didn't want to cause a scene in front of my husband and his business associates, but oh my. It was bad. I spit it out and wiped my tongue with a napkin.   My husband ordered scallops. 3 scallops with a swoosh of cauliflower puree, $25??? And they were undercooked!  My spaghetti and meatballs? Well, I think the meatballs were premade, frozen, then microwaved to reheat. They were hard and rubbery. I could not cut them with the fork.  The server was nice. But I don't see why anyone would want to spend so much money for this food when you could make it so much better yourself. Well maybe you hate cooking. I understand. Call me. I'll make it for you, fresh, in your home."}
{"text":"Overall, a wonderful experience. Had an awesome server, who was so patient while we waited for our friend to arrive. We all had a little wine and when I had an issue with mine, our server was so attentive and apologetic. We ordered the grilled artichoke, which was so good! Maybe not the best for a first date, because of the way you have to eat them, but perfect for girl's night! I believe our server's name was Ellie, and her timing was just perfect. She let us have our time, but we also had everything we needed when we needed it! I had the tortellini and I didn't want to send it back, but it was very salty. I did finish it, and there were great flavors, too, but I really wish it weren't so aggressive. Since it was girl's night, we also had dessert!! We really loved the olive oil cake!!! Really nice night out!!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, very friendly service. The wine selection was good for a chain. Definitely put this on my list as a place to come back to."}
{"text":"Excellent cuisine - you can tell it has the home made touch. Beers on tap also included local selections. Chicken parmigiana was yummy delicious. Dinner on the patio on a beautiful evening was delightful. Place was busy but we never felt forgotten nor pressured. Server knew the menu and described items of interest with knowledge and a smile. Service overall was excellent. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I do love me some Fox restaurant concepts! This was a great meal, but there is probably better Italian food to be had in the Phoenix area- go for a late dinner, when it's less crowded and service will be more attentive. I should add that my boyfriend did not like the calamari appetizer, but that may just be because he likes things super-fried."}
{"text":"Went back to North on Saturday night.  Have not been there for a few years.  I stopped going since the quality of the food did not match the pricing.   It was good but not spectacular.  Atmosphere is always great and full of energy.    Much better experience this time around.  We started with the calamari appetizer.  Calamari were tender and tasty, however, there were not enough to my liking and presentation was not very good.  Calamari were in pieces or broken.  At this type of restaurant I would expect nice round calamari rings embedded in the tender arugula served with the calamari.  The entrees were much better.  I had the braised beef short rib gnocchi with horseradish cream.  Excellent dish.  Very flavorful and gnocchi were al dente.  Beef was melt in your mouth tender. Dish was  definitely on the rich side, but worth it.  My wife decided on the salmon.  Perfectly cooked to her liking.  The creamy farro side was outstanding, almost like a risotto.  Service was very good.  Waiter was very busy, but was efficient and attentive."}
{"text":"Solid 3 Stars.     Eating at bar.  Bartenders smiling but not looking at empty glasses.    Asking if dinner ok.   Servers lost completely.    Our 5th time here so gonna be fair.    Solid 3/5.    Rosemary chicken dry.  Italian choices kinda \"flavorless\".   We are probably out in the future as there are better choices nearby.    Probably a great place tho to get a drink and people watch."}
{"text":"Today was our first time dining at North Italia. It was absolutely fantastic. Bonnie our server was so attentive and incredibly informative. She told us we had to try the short rib radiatori- it was AMAZING. Also, the calamari is insane. Make sure you try this gem and ask for Bonnie. She is the best!"}
{"text":"Went there Saturday night and the food was amazing! They sat us within 5 minutes which was really good as it was a Saturday night. Our appetizers and cocktails were really good. Love the zucchini chips and calamari. The entree orders took a bit long to arrive or I would have given them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Grilled artichokes were great. Chefs boards with cheese and meats were excellent as well. Salads are all good choices and seared scallops are delicious. Can be busy so you should make reservations but servers and greeters are extremely friendly, helpful, and attentive.  They do have a limited kids menu but many kids were there the night we were there so the place is kid friendly. It is valet parking in the lot. May be able to park on the street but I am not sure."}
{"text":"No complaints with the food, however, the service needs improvement for sure. My cousin and I went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. There was approximately 4-5 occupied tables inside the restaurant. You would think the service would be quick and smooth, but that was not the case. Throughout our meal, we kept having to wave down staff for literally everything! From placing our order, to asking for water, to asking for silverware....ridiculous. We saw staff standing near the kitchen chatting it up and having a great time, completely ignoring guests. Our server (forgot her name) had a bit of a snooty attitude as well. Ugh.   Why the 4 star review? The food of course! The food was delicious and fresh. It definitely outshined the bad. I usually feel bloated and gross after eating Italian food, but miraculously, I did not feel this way at all. The portions are perfect, the ambience is cozy and modern, and the prices are reasonable. I hope the next time I return, the service issue is a thing of the past."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place 3 and not 1 is the location, decor and menu... but the service was absolutely horrible. We waited ten minutes after we were sat to be greeted by our waiter. Who took our drink order, only brought one water (four people) and forgot the other three drinks (2 beers and a red sangria), which weren't served till our entrees came out after being reminded twice. My appetizer of soup came out less than one minute before my entree of spaghetti, which was almost cleared away immediately. 8 had to stop the waiter and tell him, \"I just got this\". Every other table around us got bread to snack on. We didn't. I asked for bread three times and was only brought it after our meal. The check then took another 15 mins. What was troubling is that it wasn't busy at all. There were numerous empty tables on the patio."}
{"text":"Great service, loved the atmosphere, amazing food! No complaints whatsoever, worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"Its getting to be that time of year when you LOVE living in the Valley...because you can dine outside and enjoy the fabulous weather! Well, even though it was still a bit warm, me and my fiance and friend had dinner outside at NORTH on Saturday and had a good experience. First of all, I love the coolness of the inside restaurant...the chairs are white and the tables are set perfectly with big wine glasses. The look just exhudes a classy experience, without being to froo-froo.  We dined on appetizers of Roasted Artichokes and Zucca Chips...which were so good! Its easy to inhale an entire bowl of those chips, with extra salt!. For dinner, I chose to be daring and try the dish called \"Not Your Traditional Chicken Lasagna\". It definitely was not typical at all. It was almost like a soup, but really tasty. They place a large egg noodle on the bottom of the bowl and then stack roasted chicken, mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, on top, then another eggnoodle and then big thin shaved pieces of parmesean and surround it in a broth. Its so good. Hard to explain it past that, but its yummy. We had to have wine with dinner, can't remember the name, but it was a Zin. I will say this...the special that night was a fish dish and I am glad we didnt dine inside. I would have been sick, because the kitchen is open and the smell just permeated the inside area. Choose to sit outside anyway and enjoy the great fall weather if you are in Glendale!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I reconnected after over 40 years and went to North Arcadia to have lunch and catch up.  Our server Michael was very attentive and knew the menu well.  The Woman manager and Michael wanted us to have dessert on them because today was a very momumental moment.  I always enjoy eating there but I will definitely go more often now Naomi Sherman"}
{"text":"With multiple tables open the host placed me at a table that was not of my liking.  In addition, he was aloof in how he handled it.   I heard the food was good but observing how they are also treating others I'm NOT impressed.  Service matters too."}
{"text":"This place is pretty solid, especially if you have children. Their children's menu is extremely inexpensive and the kids will always have leftovers. My stepdaughter even said \"this is the best spaghetti I've ever had!\". For those of you who have picky kids, you know it's awesome when you hear those words!   My husband and I split the Italian salad and Margherita pizza and added sausage. I didn't care for the Italian salad at all and my husband definitely didn't like it. I didn't care for the type of salami they used and the dressing was way too sweet! When I saw vinaigrette, I was expecting something worth out sugar or very little of it and this wasn't the case at all. I will say the pizza was very good, though I wasn't found of the crust. Their sauce was not too sweet and the basil was fresh. The sausage was also delicious!   As an appetizer, we ordered the zucchini chips. While they were not evenly cooked, I thoroughly enjoyed the ones that weren't overdone. They were just a little crispy with the perfect amount of salt.   If you plan on going for dinner, I suggest getting there early as they are slammed by 6:30 pm."}
{"text":"The environment is pretty cool. The food is tasty. Decided to check this place out because we were looking for a Fox restaurant to use our Fox Gift Card on. Saturday night, no wait, we were helped right away, and service was great. The bruschetta was very good, and their Margherita pizza and Italian salad were delicious! Very pleased."}
{"text":"Exactly what you would expect from a Fox Concepts restaurant- great food, great service, and a great atmosphere.   My friend and I had already eaten so we just stopped in for dessert. I got the mango sorbet and it was so good and fresh. They apparently have seasonal flavors! My friend got the tiramisu and it looked amazing as well.   It looks like they have a great cocktail menu too so I'm excited to come back and get some drinks and food!"}
{"text":"Came here with some new friends from a work training for a birthday. I had been to some of the North restaurants in Tucson and had enjoyed them.  They were happy to make a reservation and accommodate our group of 9. Our waitress was awesome. She was quick and happy to accommodate our splitting checks. We each requested separate checks, plus the birthday girl's and happy hour tab split between ours.   The bartender made us red and white Sangria at our request and it was GOOD! I I tried both of them. Everyone in my group really enjoyed what they ordered. I got the Margarita pizza and it was one of the best I have had, and I love Margarita pizza... The crust tasted like it was fresh made, there was a bunch of sauce (the way I really like it), and the seasonings were great! I was very happy with my choice. One friend had ordered her meal with no chicken. It was made with chicken, but the waitress was kind and offered to have it re-made. She declined, it wasn't a big deal to her. But the waitress comped her meal AND drink!!! That is darn good customer service!   I have been happy with all my experiences at any of the North line of restaurants. This place certainly kept up with that!"}
{"text":"Tried  it for the first time . Their signage is very poor took me 10 minutes to find the place.  Service was good and the staff very attentive.  However they did not bring us bread for 15 minutes . My pasta was  undercooked  I had spicy shrimp . Portion was a little small. Lastly parking was horrible"}
{"text":"The food is unbelievable but service is very slow the atmosphere is pretty loud but I cannot tell you enough how good the food was"}
{"text":"Wow.  It took me a year, but I finally made it to North.  Now, to be honest, it was a business meeting that got me here.  That means I didn't actually pay for anything and as we all know, free food tastes better.  With that disclaimer, I did really enjoy it.  North is a pretty hip looking place.  The tiny \"how can they possibly be comfortable\" couches in the foyer just scream out how fancy this place wants to appear.  It works though.  The bar is big and inviting and the whole place feel pretty spacious.  But seriously, you're reading this for the food, right?  The yucca chips are (as it says on the menu) \"yum!\"  Highly recommended as an appetizer.  I passed on the salad because I'd already been stuffed by other appetizers, but I regretted that the second one of my table-mates got his.  I suspect that it would taste just as good as it looked.  The entrees all around looked quite good.  My pasta bolognese was good, even if no one part of it stood out as such.  The duck, which I had toyed with getting, looked like it might have been the best dish on the table."}
{"text":"I just recently tried this place out with one of my friends for brunch. They have different options for food and drinks for brunch which is really nice. The food was great and fresh and the staff was super nice and considerate about the fact that we had not been to the place so they introduced everything on the menu for us and even when the plates came out, they explained a little bit more about it. Great service, great location."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to dine in North Scottsdale. I've dined here about 7-8 times- for work and play. I'll never forget a special mushroom soup they offered on my first visit. Since then I've always had a great experience, from the service to the food. My favorites: the Calamari, Chopped Chicken Salad, the Ahi (when it's available), the Scallops, and usually any special they offer. However, I have mixed feelings with the new Bar North. The bartenders weren't friendly-on all 3 occasions. The atmosphere however, I did applaud. Modern, yet comfy and easy to spend a good night with friends!"}
{"text":"North Italia lived up to the expectations!!! The decor and style of the restaurant is like a big, modern kitchen with a slight vintage flair. It paired well with the food because the food is also classic with a modern twist. Our waitress was great and made awesome suggestions for us first timers. This is a place that you can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. EVER.   I travel all over the country and try tons of new restaurants and food, North is still in my top three.  The ambiance is great, always a good vibe. If it's nice out, then the patio is great. Free valet and friendly hosts start your experience off right. Genuinely nice waiters recommend drinks and their favorite foods. I have never eaten anything bad here.   Some of my faves are:  -Short rib gnocchi  -Pizza with arugula and proscuitto -Zuchinni chips  Titos martinis are always made to perfection.  I have had nothing but good experiences here."}
{"text":"The service was great but the best part of the night by far was the dessert!! We got the salted caramel dessert. Oh my gosh it was heavenly. I'm not a pudding type of person but I loved this dessert. Oh and the food was good too. The fig and goat cheese pizza was pretty good but I would recommend the pasta. Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed every dish we ordered from here!! We celebrated a friend's birthday for dinner. Since  I arrived early before our table was ready, a drink at the bar was necessary. The restaurant is a big open space with a bar in the middle between the outside seating area and main dining area. The kitchen has a glass window allowing you to see what's going on in there.  As you can see from the pictures we got an array of dishes. Everything was delish, but my favorites were: Squid ink mafaldine- tangy with a kick of spice. Daily pizza- packed with flavor. Affogatto- great way the end a meal, with a shot of espresso and ice cream. It also had chocolate coffee beans. We had leftovers and I was excited to have it the following day. Service was great and food was on point. I highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Came on a weekend and had the egg and bacon pizza, the bolognese pasta and the short rib alfredo pasta. Simply AMAZING! Good value and nice decor."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great food and happy hour.  Recommend the bolognese, the short rib pasta, and the pizzas.  Great service too!  A weekly visit for us!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here several times. It is always great food and good service!  The bolognese is delicious. The pizza is a favorite too! The outdoor seating is a nice option if it is crowded inside. We plan to go again soon."}
{"text":"I had the Bucatini with meat balls and I have to say it was far less than par. I understand they make their own pasta, but the meat balls didn't seem like they were made in house, Why... well if you cook then you know you wouldnt include an artery in your meat balls would you? Yeah it completely ruined my appetite pulling an artery out of my half chewed mouthful of meat. Gross to say the least. I was hoping this place would be my new lunch spot however I wont be going back ever. The potatoes were amazing and the drinks were meh okay... I was surprised at the price of the food. Truly not worth what I paid..."}
{"text":"Very tasty food and great environment. Good music and friendly waiters. Beautiful fireplace outside and fun decor inside. Will be coming back fo sho"}
{"text":"One of the best Fox restaurants I've been to! The zucchini chips were delicious, the chicken Parm was awesome and came with pasta, and the Italian farm salad was so good!! I also got the rosemary lime cocktail, very similar to a Moscow mule. Our waiter Aaron was outstanding and attentive and the manager Jamie even cleared our plates. Great service, atmosphere, and food/drink!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! We ordered the meat/cheese appetizer which was a lot of food! We could have just eaten that. The homemade pasta is excellent, service is exceptional. My only very slight minus is the noise level. A bit noisy for my taste, although I would return."}
{"text":"First visit tonight, we picked up a couple things for  dinner and desert. Pleasantly surprised it was all there and packaged nicely. And!! It was great! We had the Pesto chicken pasta, the Bolognese, will have it again but we want to go in next time. Also, we splurged on the Hazelnut Torte and the Bombolinis....3 words...to die for!  I want the Torte for my birthday and the Bombolinis every Sunday morning with coffee!"}
{"text":"Loved it! My daughter dropped by for dinner and we sat at the bar since there was a long wait. I usually don't like sitting at the bar but I had a great time. The bartenders were so cool and very accommodating. The food was awesome! I had the chicken pesto with pine nuts and it was a very fresh and zesty dish. My daughter had the bolognese but she was a bit disappointed because the portion was a bit small for the price. We both had a cocktail and they were also deelish. Going back and taking my BF with me."}
{"text":"Northern style Italian..if you want a good sauce this is not the place in my opinion...Caesar salad awesome.."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I'm rarely ever in the mood to eat Italian but once I step foot into the restaurant I was hungry. I went here with my friends after doing a \"food tour\" and we were still hungry. The atmosphere here at night was spacious and very nice. I can imagine it would look aesthetically pleasing during the day too. This is already a perfect date spot. We sat down at a big table and our server, Kim recommended wine choices and we ordered a charcuterie. It was a pretty big board with prosciutto, bread, nuts, asparagus, and cheeses. We then ordered as a second course of Caesar and kale salad, both which were complex and definitely were very good. Finishing off with squid ink pasta and a bolognese. They were amazing. I recommend this place for the atmosphere, food and also great service. Kim was excellent, attentive and genuine. Definitely coming back here again!"}
{"text":"GREAT food, and I mean excellingly-awesome-o-great.  Flavors blended well, fresh as can be, blew me outta the water.  Atmosphere was busy and bustling for a Monday night. Waitress was polite and perfectly attentive. Extremely polite and kept composure with the rude couple sitting next to us (having a problem with every part of their food, which I don't understand at all).... Also seemed well managed as it was not under or over staffed even though there was a rush.  Can't wait to go back for lunch on my next trip through phoenix.    Also, I give them an A+ for serving locally made gelato from La Grand Orange. Love keeping it local."}
{"text":"Had such a wonderful dinner here. Boyfriend and I came here for dinner before heading out to the Cine Capri the day the new James Bond movie came out. It was a perfect evening to sit outside. The patio is great for people watching, although my boyfriend had a better time checking out all the sports cars that drove by. Eric was our server and he was phenomenal. We made sure to talk to the manager before we left and we had made reservations thru Open Table and also raved about him there and sent an e-mail.   My boyfriend is pretty picky so we chose the melted tomato, basil, and warm ricotta bruchetta to start . It came with 4 pieces and we devoured them in minutes. It was yummy. We also had the bread with the sun-dried tomato butter, which was also good. For dinner he had the pasta bolognese and I had the osso buco. Both were very generous servings. His was good, but I'm not sure what it was, I think fennel, was a bit overpowering. The osso buco was sooooo good. The meat and polenta melt in your mouth. I was in heaven. Could not have made a better selection. I can't wait to come back here and bring my family for my birthday next month. Our waiter suggested a nice red wine with our meal with was a perfect compliment, but I can't remember what it was called. Oh, well. We never felt rushed during our meal even though we did take our time for a Friday night. I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Owner has reached out to me about our last visit . After being in biz for 13 years shows they still care , which is great to see . I would give them another shot as I was excited about their homemade pastas."}
{"text":"Love love love love love North!! Italian is my favorite because I can cook it so well. So when I eat at an Italian restaurant I'm EXTRA picky. My all time fav dish is the pesto pasta it's to die for. But when I'm feeling like not having something so rich I go for the Parmesan cream sauce pasta (can't remember the exact name) but oh my gosh is it phenomenal or wha! (Pair it with a glass or Riesling)  Ooo on appetizers try the deep fried balls. I believe it's stuffed with maybe a cheesy risotto. Regardless, it's literally so good."}
{"text":"So I've been to North roughly 5-6 times with great experiences but the service tonight was really poor. No drink refills, messed up orders, and just over all really slow. Kale salad was great though as well as the sangria but my family probably won't be back for a while after that. Hopefully they get things together!"}
{"text":"Sam Fox knows how to create restaurant with the perfect dinning experience. Their Spinach Ravioli with pesto sauce is incredible. They also have a Truffle bread appetizer that is to die for. Sam, Please bring North and Blanco's to Salt Lake City."}
{"text":"Who am I to tell Sam Fox how to run a restaurant, but...Sam: you need to send your server at North back to Customer Service 101.  The food was fine..the setting was beautiful, and the price was right.  OK....  But.  Our server tonight was so disinterested in our table, it seemed as if we had done something to turn her off.  Granted...I am 69...and our guest was celebrating his 90th birthday.  We sat on the patio in a lovely table in the corner.  Whoever the tallish blond women was who was assigned to our table showed absolutely ZERO personality...was obviously distracted, as the common courtesies of being a server were totally missing.  When the reservation was made, we were asked if it was for a special event.  We advised that we were celebrating a major birthday...and...and...nothing.  When we asked to see the desert menu, our server flipped ONE menu down for the four of us, and walked away for another ten minutes. No explanation.  Nada.  menu dripped...walked away...and didn;t return for too long a time.  I paid the bill...left a 20% tip...and mentioned to her when we left, \"Did anyone advise that we WERE celebrating an occasion?\"  She said the message never got to her...and she was sorry.  \"Can I get you a desert to go?\"  Anyway.  For such a great operator as Fox Restaurant Concepts, perhaps you have grown too large and too successful to properly train your servers in how to show a bit of enthusiasm and interest.  Will we return?  Probably sometime down the road.  But in the meantime, I hope whoever the disinterested server is..or was...tell her that she spoiled a nice evening for us.  I hate being dismissed as a senior.  I hate being treated with no enthusiasm.  I hate being ignored.   Good luck Sam Fox.  Your empire could be out of control.  EDIT REVIEW: Today, I got a call from Mike, the Manager for North. He was most apologetic that we had a poor experience, and invited me to return and have dinner on him.  I was most appreciative of his response, and told him that my goal was to advise North that they had not met my expectations, and I wanted the restaurant to know about our evening.  To err is human...and NORTH has met my expectation for responding to my issue.  They have done all they could do...and I am now more than satisfied that my issue was addressed.  Thanks Mike...

{"text":"Outstanding.  Food/service/price all top drawer.  We had come from Central Bistro where we were driven out by the noise.  Had a double great meal... Avoid the noise and go here. LJK"}
{"text":"Shelbi was our server and she was absolutely incredible - personable, charming, and very attentive. They made a very good Bullitt Rye old fashioned for me and my wife enjoyed her glass of Pinot Noir. The squid ink pasta with shrimp & calamari was very good. I'd definitely order it again but beware, it is spicy! My wife's salmon was perfectly cooked. Kids had Strozzapereti & chicken parm... Both were also excellent. Overall, a great low-key dinner with delicious food and superb service."}
{"text":"What a great experience on a Sunday night. They had happy hour that night and it had some great deals on it. My husband loved the board and bottle special. The antipasto board was delicious and had a ton of variety. I ordered the chicken Parmesan and it was probably the best I have ever had. Can't wait to visit Scottsdale again and go back!"}
{"text":"This is a go to for us. Love this place. Great drinks, food and service. Creative Chef!Love the ambiance especially during patio weather."}
{"text":"I am so pleased that the owner James reached out to me regarding our experience. This speaks volumes! That type of attention and service is what keeps us going back to the places we frequent! We will most certainly return to North Italia in Phoenix very soon and will write the last visit off as a fluke! It happens to the best of us:-) Thank you so much James for being a great business owner in our community!"}
{"text":"We checked this place out for lunch and had a fewlozzas and salads and everything was great. The meatballs are awesome. I can't wait to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Great food!   Great Service!   Hostess recommended the chicken parm., so one of us hot that dish, then we also got a special eggplant parm pizza, and spaghetti and meatballs.  Pasta was fresh, made at the restaurant, plus they are generous with the sauce.  Husband really liked the meatballs; great flavor and moist.  My son really liked the chicken parm.  Pizza is large enough to share between 2, loved the crust.  Only downside is that it is very loud, so hard to talk.  But the food and service made up for any problems.  Definitely would come back if staying nearby, and would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Absolutely mouth watering amazing.  The sangria is the best I've ever had and the special is Brussels sprout shaved something and Pistachios Pizza it was delicious.  Come here. Try it."}
{"text":"I'm going to change my review. Haven't been here in a year or two.  Place is really nice and I will say the food is very very good. The Pig Pizza is top notch, and the tortellini is amazing.  However, the dining \"experience\" for me was lacking for the following reasons:  1.  Glasses tasted a little bit \"soapy\" (order your beer in a bottle);  2.  Whenever my wife and I were in an in-depth conversation, it seems we were interrupted with a question that didn't need to be asked.  When someone is enjoying a conversation, do what they do at Hillstone (let them talk, wait for the moment when they are not engaged in a conversation, then ask them if everything is okay).  Clearly everything is okay when a conversation is going.  Just one of those little details you will not find waiters and waitresses doing at Hillstone that we got here.    3.  At around 8:30 p.m. (while we were still eating) one gal came by and started sweeping the floor aggressively right next to our table.  I realize she wanted to get out of there, but we were still eating.  If you have ever seen anyone sweep a floor, you know particles go flying everywhere - not the type of \"seasoning\" I am looking for.  Love the place, but training the staff in the finer points of customer etiquette would increase your profits big time.  People who understand fine dining see these things and it impinges on the overall experience.  I am still a fan, so hopefully digest this in the spirit it is intended - to be helpful."}
{"text":"Booked a work dinner with David Delci Event Coordinator and all was exceptional. From the booking with David to the service at the restaurant everything was truly fabulous.  We had an assortment of wonderful items starting with the mussels, meatball sandwiches, chicken Parm, and several of the pizzas. Nothing disappointed us. I highly recommend this as a great stop while you're in Vegas. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of small and local business and I must admit I felt a little protective when I saw a Fox Concepts restaurant going up in my own neighborhood.  I finally decided to try it with a friend and I have to say it's a wonderful addition to current Arcadia offerings.  I stopped by ahead of time to grab a menu to peruse and I was immediately excited because I saw that if my first visit was good, I'd have to do about 10 more to sample everything that caught my eye.  When I see \"Italian\" I brace myself for more of the same old pastas and sauces, but this menu has a lot of variety, and it includes seasonal offerings (which as a nutritionist is important to me).  I tried a farro-kale salad and would order it again (on trip 11, after trying everything else!)  My friend and I sat on the patio which, despite the cold night, was packed the entire time we were there.  I do love the neighboring restaurants but it's nice to have a little bit of competition for inspiration.  So happy this is within walking distance for me!  Valet parking is complimentary, by the way, for those who drive."}
{"text":"Place is good!   Have been here about 3 times and it has always pleasing. Drove by the place for quite some time when I was on the way to Postino. It's definitely attractive from the outside so that made me check it out. Service is decent here and the food is great. Although, a few of their signature dishes need a couple tweaks. The spicy shrimp pasta first hits your pallet with a bang but you are soon left with a 'nothing' taste. I would attribute it to lack of seasoning. The spinach tortelloni is great but they put WAY too much butter. A seasoned chef would send it back. The theme of the restaurant (country) doesn't match the type of food they serve although it somehow works...  Pros -nice atmosphere -cool design -decent service -great food  Cons -some off tasting food -community seating"}
{"text":"Our party of 30 showed up without reservations. There seemed to be concern from the hostesses if they could accommodate us. They sat us on the patio with a bit of hesitation so we were unsure sure how the experience would be. Brenda helped us and rocked it! She was incredible. She seriously made the experience for us. The food was great and Brenda was amazing!! We had a great meal, lots of fun and perfect service. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today with a friend and I was pleasantly surprised. Located near the Biltmore I was expecting something more stuffy, but I arrived I was greeted by a lovely open aired building with a very nature friendly design. I chose to dine outside on the patio and was greeted very quickly by our waitress who was very friendly and helpful.   I ordered the Strozzapreti and my friend ordered the seasonal vegetable salad with an appetizer of steamed mussels. When the mussels came out I was very satisfied with the amount they gave us, however when the main courses arrived I was a bit surprised. The food was beautiful and well presented however I felt like I was eating a side pasta for $17. Despite the size of the food it was very flavorful and very fresh. y friend was a little put off the size as well, but enjoyed her food as well.   I feel that it was a nice experience and that the atmosphere was nice. However I thought it was a bit over priced for the amount you got. Despite this it is still worth a try and I suggest you come on a week day during lunch when it is not so busy."}
{"text":"Do not understand the criticism of the plain old Spaghetti and Meatballs but I find it to be one of the best I have ever had. To put that into perspective...I eat out ALL the time in all kinds of restaurants and all over the US. It is just flat out good. North is one of my favorite restaurants. My recommendation is just go. Someone tell me about a better spaghetti and meatballs...and I will go."}
{"text":"Very nice facility. So convenient if you live near Arcadia. Staff is pleasant and the food is very tasty. I've been here several times and have always left pleased. The indoor/outdoor bar is great for first dates, meeting up with friends, or grabbing a drink after work. This place is open late on the weekends too."}
{"text":"North has improved since I first came here. Their portion sizes are much larger than my first visit, making it a much better value for the money. I really love the chicken pesto and the chicken parmigiana, both have fresh sauces with homemade pasta. Service has been very good, as well as friendly. They have a fantastic all day happy hour on Sunday with discounted food and 1/2 price bottles of wine. They also have a delicious weekend brunch. The baked french toast is amazing, and they offer a cool twist on the Bloody Mary called the Red Rooster. I'm glad I gave North a second chance."}
{"text":"North Italia was highly recommend to us, so we were very excited to go. The sangria was very good as was the mixed drink my husband got. Food came out quick and our waiter was attentive. The truffle garlic bread was highly recommend by friends so we were very anxious to try. Was swimming in grease. Not my favorite. The chefs board was good; however, was lacking on the amount of cheese we have grown to expect from chefs boards. The pizza was amazing!! It was topped with figs, goat cheese, and arugula and was something I'd order again. My husband didn't really enjoy it on the other hand. Overall, it's pretty good. Dessert wasn't great. We would skip it next time. Would return for happy hour and the beautiful outside seating."}
{"text":"I've been to NoRTH three times - it's in my neighborhood. Food is solid, portions are wanting, service is stellar. My main hang up is the price. Too much for what you get. I'd come here once a week if they had a better happy hour, bigger portions and less expensive prices.  Don't miss the salted caramel budino - it is pure heaven."}
{"text":"We've been here several times for dinner and always gotten to sit outside - it's a nice ambience out there! Their drink selection is really fun - I haven't managed to get through their entire menu yet. You can't beat the happy hour pizza and wine combo for $20! Their food is eclectic and delicious, good for any crowd, casual or a bit dressed for date night. The one downside is their parking - you almost have to valet it because parking is so limited and so crazy. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great happy hour date night - this is a wonderful outdoor hangout. The happy hour menu is perfect - the 'bottle and board' is a good bottle of wine and a lovely pizza - you have choices! For a good cucumber drink - the mazzafiato is delish! The parking is atrocious and the only reason it's tolerable is because valet is offered. Worth a trip indeed!"}
{"text":"This is a definite must eat!!  Service and food and drink selection are outstanding.   Make a reservation to guarantee a seat."}
{"text":"Best Italian for a reasonable price. Overall best handmade pasta in phoenix Scottsdale."}
{"text":"After several years, this restaurant remains my favorite of all time. My husband and I have celebrated many special occasions here, including both of our birthdays last year, plus valentine's day when they had a special couple's menu. And we went countless other times, as well. The environment cannot be topped. The food is amazing. The service is friendly, courteous and professional. I literally dream about their bolognese. I no longer live in Phoenix, but whenever I visit this will be my first stop."}
{"text":"this was our first visit to this great food establishment and were treated like royalty.  the food, beverage and service were all truly impressive.  the manager on duty (sarah wilson) was spot on with her eye for detail and awareness to her guests.  it was a busy valentine's day crowd and this group of service providers rocked it with our big party of 7.  all of the entrees and apps were delicious with the zuchs and the lemon donuts totally bomb!  we will be back!  (as arnold would say). thanks for a great outing with some very important people in our lives."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD! This is my new favorite restaurant! I love the decor and the clean dining room. I can't wait to try out the indoor-outdoor patio! Gianna is so kind and makes me feel like a regular and very at home. They have an extensive Italian wine list. They use very fresh and authentic Italian ingredients. Their pasta is so light and you can see them cooking it from their open kitchen. Kay the manager came and she was fantastic and so welcoming. I can't wait to suggest this restaurant to anyone that visits Las Vegas or Summerlin."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always crave it.... it's that good. Everything is fresh and you can taste it. The white truffle garlic bread & strozzapreti are both dishes I could eat for the rest of my life. The salmon is also amazing with a nice crispy crust. Basically you should go here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"North Italia has amazing food and wonderful service.  However, it is NOISY!  Really, really noisy.  We were there on a busy Saturday night and table conversation was impossible.  We will return for the deliciousness, but most likely for lunch or a very early dinner when things might be quieter."}
{"text":"Trying to order Pizza in Arcadia wasn't the easiest task on a Saturday night during a holiday weekend. After the majority of places showed either closed or a 45 minute wait, I stumbled upon North on the yelp app. And stumble, we did.   We walked down to the North bar with the intention of getting some late night grub. We were pleasantly surprised when the entire menu was quite affordable. For a cheese pizza, sangria and a beer it was $28. The pizza was mouthwateringly delicious despite the fact that it was just a basic cheese. It's definitely something you can scarf down and split for a great date.   The sangria was some of the best I've ever had. I don't like sweet drinks, but much to my surprise this was a very winey and strong sangria. Just my style! I was so happy with it that it's going to be one of my staple places to go now.  The bartender was so polite and nice. Instead of being annoyed with us for walking in an hour shy of closing, he welcomed us with ample suggestions. He never rushed us and was the appropriate amount of attentive.   Their menu is consistently good across their locations. I've had the greatest salads here. Their salmon is to die for. It's safe to say this is in my top five favorite restaurants in Scottsdale/Phoenix."}
{"text":"First time here, they said it would be about a 20 minute wait but was seated within 10 minutes. The vibe is relaxed and calm with a modern feel. The chicken Parmesan was amazing, and I eat a lot of Italian food. Very friendly staff, Shelby was our server and she was awesome. Gave great recommendations and sold us on a dessert that I can't wait to eat again. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I was extremely surprised and quite impressed to have received contact from a representative of North Fattoria nearly 2 weeks ago, in regards to my initial review.  Unfortunately, after responding back to the representative with my contact information, I never received another response back. Perhaps I shouldn't have put faith in their customer service after all."}
{"text":"I was very happy with the food at Sauce and Olive and Ivy and had been wanting to try North for a while. I received a gift card for Christmas to Fox restaurants so my husband, daughter and I went in over the weekend. Note: there is no kids menu. The service was very good. Our food took longer than expected so the manager sent us over an order of zucchini chips and our waitress brought us bread with a roasted red pepper butter.  My husband ordered the Lasagna and I ordered a gorgonzola chicken salad. The food was just not good. I wish I could say it was but it wasn't. I actually got sick after eating there. :( I will stick with the other Fox restaurants."}
{"text":"I love my Sundays at the North Italia. Wonderful ambience and welcoming service. My favorite is their $20 bottle of wine and pizza/ chefs board offer. You can't pass on this one. Our waitress was very nice and the food was delish! I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Very nice ambience and the food is moderately good. The bruschetta and the archini mushroom was good. The pasta was undercooked and the Moscow mule is not served in a copper mug unfortunately"}
{"text":"Tonight was evidently not to be either North's or our night. We had eaten at the North restaurant in Kierland a number of times; however, we live in downtown Phoenix thus it was a perfect occasion to try the Arcadia restaurant. We arrived at the restaurant at approximately 9:15.  You have to park with  valet at this location, we ended up waiting for a few minutes for them to arrive -at that moment I thought we should leave, if only I had listened to myself. We were seated, I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio, a cauliflower appetizer, and goat cheese bruschetta.  The wine was mediocre, the cauliflower appefizer an abomination. It was a ten dollar appetizer that appeared as though it had been already served and partially eaten. The flavor was a 2.5 out of 5; the plating of it was dreadful After 25 minutes had lapsed my husband and I became concerned that the bruschetta had not arrived.  A few minutes later ( I believe a manager) delivered the bruschetta. She said \"this took far longer than it should have so we will take care of this\". Impressed I ordered another glass of wine. We then proceeded to bite into the brushettta.  The red peppers on top were right our of the refrigerator, icy cold. My husband chatted with our waiter, and he spoke to the manager. They opted to comp the cauliflower app and the glass of wine ( we cancelled the second one). My husband and I have both worked in restaurants in our lives and understand having a poor evening. We also have visited a number of the Fox restaurants and love them.  Due to our experience tonight we will not be visiting another North restaurant as there are many more options, the experience tonight ruined our evening and life is too short for bad food.  Initially I gave a one star review; however,..... I wanted to be careful to be fair thus changed it to 2."}
{"text":"The food was great, i had our server take our order,  After that he never returned... We asked another server to add a calamari.  Still a no show until we got the check.. Anyways im surecthe server may have had a bad day, I definitely will return just sucks about the server."}
{"text":"Okay so let me start with: YES, expect a wait! But they text you when you're tables gonna be ready so you can wait in your car! score! The food here is amazing, it's a little menu, but has a lil something for everyone! Leonard is the best server, so funny and gives A+ recommendations! Def one of my new favorite places in Vegas! 10/10 would indulge again"}
{"text":"I had been to noRTH a few times both for dinner and happy hour and decided to I trounce a few friends to my new happy hour pic. I got there about 20 minutes early, got a table and ordered a glass of wine. It was very busy, loud and a bit crazy on that night. I waited for friends who called me to say that when they attempted to valet park, they were told the lot was full. They weren't offered an alternative. They decided to park in the lot of the sopping center to the west and were told by the security guard there that parking was not for the patrons of the restaurant and their cars would be towed if they parked there. They told me they'd meet me at Chelsea's kitchen. I told my waitress and had to cash out on the glass of wine that I hadn't even had a chance to try. I was furious! I left, the manager came out as I waited 15 minutes to get my car and she asked why I was leaving. I explained. She said that they could have parked at the circle k or 7 eleven or whatever is across the street and I asked why the valet hadn't told my friends that. She said she didn't know - was sorry-and that was it. Didn't comp the drink I didn't drink, I felt obliged to tip both the waitress and valet modestly but overall arrived almost a half an hour after my friends at Chelsea's and it was a very bad experience all around! I won't be meeting anyone there again. Although it only happened once out of four times there, once was enough!"}
{"text":"I feel like north is just the place that everyone knows and loves in Arcadia. It's like mom's home cooking with a fancier display of your entree. Seems ridiculous to go to a place like this and order spaghetti and meat balls but I'm a simple chick, I can't help it. Plus, it's tasty as all get out! Great cocktails, great food and the ambience is retro and inviting. You can valet here, which I just love the convenience of but we were also just able to park last time and that steals my heart. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Can you really go wrong with a fox restaurant? I don't think I have.. They're always been pretty safe choices whenever we pick restaurants and North was no exception. We started with a bottle of wine, Barbera. It came uncorked which I found strange.  Waiter said bartender opened. Maybe my restaurant friends can tell me if this is normal or not? Back to the food.. We ordered the calarami. It was alright. It's a litte too crispy and you really can't taste to calamari at all. I had the Strozzapretti as my meal. It was delicious and not too rich. There was also plenty of grilled chicken in the dish so the pasta didn't feel overwhelming. My husband had the Spinach Tortelloni. He loved it but it is very rich! I tasted it and thought it was great as well. We both agreed the Strozzapretti was the better of the two. Parking is mostly vallet unless you park across the street. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Wow! Of all the restaurants in Phoenix North Italia is the best. As you see from my last updated review we had a bad experience with a take out order this evening. This was an isolated event and Chris the manager corrected the problem immediately and personally contacted us to make it right. They are changing their take out containers and they are fully committed to the satisfaction of their guests. Coming from a restaurant background I can tell you that the manager of North Italia is the example of a perfect manager and is the standard to which all restaurant managers should strive to achieve. We will be loyal customers of North from here on out and we will tell everyone about this spectacular establishment. As I have said many times the food is phenomenal and the experience you will have is top notch.  Don't let another day pass, try North and see for yourself. Bravo to North and Chris!  I am adding to this review and changing my rating from 5 stars to 1 star due to their take out. We loved North so much we went there tonight and ordered our favorite dishes. The hostess left our order sitting on the counter for 10 minutes at least. When I inquired I watched her get our take out that had been sitting there. She then lied and said it had just came out. When I got it home, I live 5 minutes away, our $60.00 dollar dinner was ice cold. To make matters worse their take out containers are made of paper and do nothing to keep your food hot. AND because they are paper they soaked up all the sauce off our pasta and the dishes were ruined. We threw them out. I am very disappointed with North. Bad service and cold food.  Food was absolutely delicious. We go to North for their Gnocchi, which is to die for! On this night they were out of the short ribs but the manager heard how disappointed I was and figured out a way to rush the fresh batch of short ribs they were making so he could make the gnocchi happen for me. If by some bizarre reason you haven't tried North go there ASAP. You will absolutely love it. Don't forget to end your meal with the salted caramel pudding it's divine"}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight and it's a great date night spot. Definitely had a good vibe going on. The place was packed but didn't take long for us to get seated.   The food was good but nothing was spectacular. Their calamari was to bready but the addition of the arugula was nice. We also ordered the zucchini chips and truffle garlic bread which were both good as well.   For my entree I tried the squid ink pasta which was tasty but not the flavor that I was looking for. It was Spicy which I like, but it overpowered any of the seafood flavor that I was looking for. My husband had the chicken parm which he liked. It came with Alfredo rigatoni which was a little different from the usual red sauce pasta that it usually comes with. The portions are bigger than Ithey look like in the pictures. Definitely enough to fill the belly. Oh and they have local beers on tap which I thought was a nice touch.   Would probably come back for a nice friends dinner."}
{"text":"I'm a true believer that North Happy Hour is one of the best in the valley. It has an open air/trendy vibe, delicious sangria and fabulous pizza. Oh and I couldn't forget the zucca chips {zucchini chips} for $3!! Their bottle & board special is $20 for a bottle of wine or sangria + a margherita pizza or their pizza of the day {which is always fabulous}. Their pizza of the day today was a white pizza with bacon, fig & peperoncino peppers. To. Die. For. The perfect combination of sweet & spicy!   The best part, they have HH ALL DAY SUNDAY too!!! Also, for brunch, their chicken salad sandwich is phenomenal! Their pastas are all hand-made and you truly can't go wrong with any of them. Yum! It's safe to say that I'm a regular here."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. I have only had their dessert so I will have to come back and try their entrees... but dessert wise, no thanks.  I really like the patio and people watching, it's a great spot.   I hope when I sit down for dinner I will be able to give it a few more stars but until then, it's just ok."}
{"text":"No where near as good as the one on 40th and Camelback.  And the seating, it is so horrible, for gods sakes, get some more comfortable chairs.  I work my ass off to be in shape, so I don't have enough cushion for those hard chairs.  We had our moms night out there last Saturday and my hubby offered to drive me, so I told him to pick me up after two hours.  He told me I could stay longer,  I told him, no way, my butt couldn't take it any more, I went to the chiropractor on Monday, I still have such a back ache from those horrible, horrible chairs.  Stepping down from the soap box, the pizza piece I tasted from my friend was ok, and my other friend barely ate her muscles.  The Milano Mule was good, but didn't numb my back pain enough."}
{"text":"I really can't get enough of this place.  For anyone who understands true Italian food, this is a must try.  I always enjoy their fish.  Perfectly prepared and always served up with delicious vegetables.  In my opinion, this place is a bargain given the entrees are all in the $20-30 range.  Pasta is even less than that.  They also have a decent Italian wine offering with most glasses in the $8-10 range and bottles below $40.  I've always found the food fresh, the service pleasant and the atmosphere lively.  What more can you ask for?  Oh, LARGER portions?  Go to Golden Corral if you want to stuff your face."}
{"text":"Service here totally sucks. I was acusssed by the waitress of lying when I told her we had been waiting an hour for our food.    How f'd is that, she went and checked when the ticket was entered and said it was entered 15 mins ago. I told her then the waitress forgot to put it in.   It was very weird, however the Duck is very good. Same with the antipasta.  Im sure that horrible bit#$ is gone :)"}
{"text":"Hats off to you, North Italia!   Had a great time for lunch. Thursday, August 4, 2016, everything was a fantastic lunch experience. That includes... the valet, the host, our server and the chefs! Food was delicious,  from calamari to tiramisu.   See ya soon."}
{"text":"We have been to North many times over the years and have always enjoyed great  food and service. This time the food was great,  but the service was awful.  Our waitress Kelly ignored us and was really rude. I eat there frequently and am normally a good tipper but couldn't  justify it this time.   She  never brought bread, and seemed annoyed when we asked a question about our bill. Not what I've come to expect from service at North over the years.  Kelly needs an attitude adjustment . Will avoid her if we go back!"}
{"text":"Our server was Kalina, she made our visit absolutely great! We decided to try this place for our anniversary and I'm so happy we did. The food was really good but her service was the best part of our experience. She was very friendly and so attentive. This will definitely become a top choice for the future. Thank you Kalina!"}
{"text":"Mediocre restaurant. Sat down to a busy restaurant for a Wednesday night. The restaurant is staffed (perhaps overstaffed) with young people running around, but not doing too much.   The hostess sat us right away, and was very nice. She even had a recommendation when asked about the food.  However, we sat there for 10 to 15 minutes while waiting for a glass of water or any server to even pay attention to us.  Server was nice enough, but poorly trained. Didn't know to get water right away. When the food came (pizza and arancini) I had to flag down a server (5 minutes of waving at workers - not exagerrating) just to get a plate. My wife wanted some bread with her pasta. I noticed that all the other tables had bread, so I asked my server how much a plate of bread cost. He responded it was free and asked if we wanted some.   The food was decent, but nothing special. I ordered the eggplant pizza (special) and arancini.  Wife got seafood maladine (pasta). Pizza tasted okay, but all of tthe toppings came off every slice in the first small bite, which means I mostly ate crunchy bread with tomato sauce residue.  The arancini was awesome.  The arancini was awesome.  (I wrote this twice on purpose. Pay attention.)  Wife's pasta with squid ink was mostly tasteless.  I put my nose into the dish and couldn't even smell any seafood.    We thought about dessert, but the entire meal felt like a failed first date, where nothing is really wrong, but it's not right either.  You just don't feel any chemistry. We decided to  quit while we weren't completely regretful. We left.   In summary: Get the arancini appetizer!!! Then leave."}
{"text":"I really love this place. I have only been here a handful of times but each time has been consistently fresh and tasty. I have had their gnocchi, a few of their pizzas, and their seasonal vegetable salad and I still don't know which I like better. The pizzas are hand-made and the crust isn't too thick or too thin-just right! They have really delicious pizza toppings and a variety of pizzas to choose from. Their egg pizza with bacon is really great and so is their fig and prosciutto pizza! I just had their salted caramel bambino, essentially a caramel creme fraiche, and it was pretty darn great. The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is their coffee-I had a cup and it tasted a little burnt. However, I doubt most people come here to get a cup of coffee. I especially love that they have all day happy hour on Sundays with great deals on food AND booze. Definitely a must-try."}
{"text":"North is work 4.5 stars. I was going to put 5 stars, but they got rid of my favorite dish (gnocchi) so I had to dock them a little. This is one of the better Fox restaurants. Like other Fox restaurants they have excellent service, from valet to waiter. I strongly recommend the Zucca chips which should be disgusting, but are actually delightful."}
{"text":"The food was exquisite. I thought everything was done wonderfully and all the many entrees that we tried were very good. My one complaint was that it was so long of a wait we had mixed in with the extremely dim lighting, even for me. Overall, there is a pasta dish for everyone and it makes for a pleasant date night or family night!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night.  Really good food.  Focus on fresh quality ingredients.  Good wine list with lots of variation. Had the arancini which we eat at other places (we are from Seattle) but these were the best we've had.  I had the lasagne and Jeff had the spaghetti.  Both were over the top good.  Al dente pasta great flavors and good meatball texture.  Hate when they over work the meat into a mushy little ball.  This place is a definite go to if your in the area"}
{"text":"There's nothing wrong with calling a good food dish what it is, but here they call their tomato meat sauce \"Bolognese\" and that's not what it is.  Bolognese doesn't come close to this dish.  It just doesn't. Look up the classic recipe and compare it to this.   You get the feeling someone is opening an aseptic bag and heating its predictable, measured corporate contents.  You end up with really good airline food. Service was attentive and the cocktails didn't skimp.  A lot of families with small children for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Sit outside!  Inside can be a little crowded & loud, but outside is just right!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! The quality here is second to none. Affordable lunch and well priced dinner. Definitely worth splurging for. Loved every bit of everything we had... even the squid ink pasta was AMAZING! If you're in the area GO GO GO!!"}
{"text":"Ordered Bruschetta and it was completely burnt.  Had to pay a premium for New Years too."}
{"text":"I didn't realize there were so many North locations across the U.S. Fox Restaurant Concepts calls this their 'love letter to Italy'. I personally enjoy dining at this location in Arcadia. It's just a just short walk north of foodie paradise on 40th and Campbell. North Italia is a modern take on made-from-scratch traditional Italian dishes prepared daily with fresh, seasonal ingredients. My first experience here was an evening consisting of a bottle of wine and a chef board with a buddy of mine. They have a nice open patio bar area that has plenty of shade from the surrounding trees. The restaurant is very inviting and has a nice relaxed atmosphere to it. The Pig (with Italian sausage and San Marzano tomato sauce) and Bacon & Egg Pizza are some of the popular pizza selections. They also have a variety of wines and small plates (like the signature Prosciutto Bruschetta with Crescenza cheese and grilled asparagus- yum) to choose from. Just recently I tried their spaghetti & braised meatball plate. The pasta is thicker than most spaghetti noodles but nice and smooth. It's one of the best spaghetti dishes I've ever tried. I enjoyed watching the prep guys preparing some pasta for national pasta day. Service has always been great for me here as they really stress hospitality. If you love casual Italian food, this is a nice place to stop in for a little taste of Italy."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Gianna is wonderful!! Her service is excellent! We will be back because of her! Food was tasty & perfect! Keep up the amazing job North Italia!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Las Veags!!! The pizza was outstanding!!!  Service was just as it should be!!  AWESOME!!  When your in Vegas EAT HERE AT LEAST Once! Have to ask for Bunny as your server!!  She rocks"}
{"text":"I'm a bit bummed. This was my FAVORITE restaurant in the Valley for several years.  But... recently, my best friend and I went there for a nice, quiet dinner. The food was great, the drinks were tasty, and then we ate the bread.  My friend pulled out a HAIRBALL from the bread. We understood the bread was brought over from a different location, so NoRTH had little to do with this. That's fine.  What bothered us was that the manager initially said, \"I'm sorry. We'll make sure you don't pay for your drinks.\"  So... my friend pulls out a gross, big hairball (definitely human hair), but we only get free drinks out of it? We'd still have to pay around $50 because of the entrees.  Later, the manager comes back and says, \"Actually, everything is on the house.\" Well no kidding! Jeez... I would hope so.  After we were tossed around a bit after that incident, it left a bad taste in my mouth (and definitely my friend's. Ew.) so I don't want to return for more. It's a bummer because I loved this place (which is why I at least gave it a couple stars)."}
{"text":"Went for brunch before flying out on a Sunday.  Told the waitress we had to be out in less than an hour and she totally made that happen.  The bellini and my friend's drink (the cocktail w grand mariner) were both delicious.  We split a cinnamon roll which was amazing esp for $3.  We both got the veggie egg scramble.  Delicious!  And loved the restaurant's bread as well.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Classic evening at North. Good food; good fun with friends on the patio  Mussels were excellent; Margaret had some sort of pasta that was excellent; Jon and I split a bottle of excellent wine. So what the heck; come on over and have some excellent food."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM!  At first I wasn't a fan of North from my first visit due to the lack of service on a slow lunch afternoon. It was really disappointing. They also knew there wasn't any service because we received free Zucca Chips. They were good! I was really bummed with the service because I loved the look and feel of the restaurant. It felt like you were somewhere completely different than Camelback and 40th Street!!  As I thought I wasn't coming back, this has been the hangout for my co-workers and I!! We love the happy hour that ends at 6pm and is perfect for us just getting off work. We love getting the bottle and board for only $20!!!! What a deal! And the boards are NOT light, lots of food on it. This last time I tried their Sangria and it was really good.  I'm glad I ended up liking it again :) Thank you!"}
{"text":"The establishment is booming with life.  Music. Lively people and noise.  It's a happening place and the community loves this restaurant.     The vegetable salad was excellent. Everything in season was added!  My moscow mule was also very refreshing.  I was told the scallops were one of the signature dishes.  I loved the bed of risotto and bitter greens but the scallops had a bitter aftertaste often present if the scallops are not soaked in a special solution if \"from frozen.\"   So, perhaps the dish was a disappointment.  I regretted not ordering the Bolognese (pasta) which I saw more customers enjoying with a smile on their faces.  Next time...if I\"m in Phoenix I'll re-review."}
{"text":"Had dinner there tonight, it was our first time ordered 2 different bruchetas, the chef's board, zucca chips, the pig & the fig and prosciutto pizzas also got the tiramisu and the salted caramel desert .....the food was spectacular!!! The atomospher reminder me of several restaurants I have visited in San Diego and made me feel like I was almost back in California by the beach. Our waiter Nicolas was the best . Overall had an amazing time !"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to come back to North Italia after a Yelp Event I attended last year. I finally got the chance last week. I could not have been more pleased with my experience.   First, I just love the look and feel of this place. Hidden behind a large group of trees is hidden this gorgeous, tall, modern, metal and wooden building. You first see their large wrap around Bar top. My favorite. You can sit either inside at the bar top of out side with the patio behind you. There is plenty of seating in the dinning area as well. The open concept has a welcoming feel. Even the kitchen is open for the public to come watch them create magic.   My husband and I sat at the bar top as we usually do. The service was crazy friendly, helpful, and giving. We ended up with a free appetizer, dessert, and coffee after all was said and done. They just want you to enjoy your time there, get stuffed, and try everything. To start we ordered CRISPY CALAMARI: ($12) Arugula & grilled lemon vinaigrette. Such complementary flavors. I highly recommend this to start with. Our server also got us the ZUCCA CHIPS ($7) when I asked him what it was. He just said \"Hold on, let me show you.\" These were very thinly sliced zucchini chips, lightly battered and fried. This would be perfect to start with if you are looking for something to not fill you up before our dinner. They were like tiny potato chips, and equally addicting. For our main entree's we shared both the SHORT RIB RADIATORI ($20) parmesan cream, fresh horseradish, wilted arugula, herbed breadcrumb. So creamy and rich. The bread crumbs were the perfect touch to the dish because it was so rich. It helped soak up some of the rich cream. The Braised pork paired nicely with its sweet flavor. We also had the PROSCIUTTO PIZZA  ($14) mission fig, goat cheese and arugula. I mean... you cant go wrong with Fig's and goat cheese. For dessert we couldn't decided between the 2 so when we asked the server what he preferred he told us he would bring out the one he liked best. He brought us both. They were just too sweet to us. He asked me if I wanted a coffee, I said I would love a cappuccino that he also gave us. I wish I caught his name. Anyway... we had the SALTED CARAMEL BUDINO ($7) crème fraiche, maldon sea salt. Like a Salted Carmel Crème Brulee it was perfect. And Lastly the BOMBOLINI ($6) (italian donuts) meyer lemon curd,vanilla mascarpone. They were warm and melted in your mouth.   I really cant say one bad word about this place. I'm not sure if I can go back. I don't think anything will top our first experience here. But the food was so dang good... I'm going to have to come back."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood spot, the Mozzarella appetizer is yummy along with the caramel pudding!"}
{"text":"Second time in and still pleased... I highly recommend getting there distinctively fresh and smart anti-pasta dish... Also love the grilled artichoke with the lovely house made lemon aoli..."}
{"text":"Lovely place!!!! Patio is adorable! Super Italian cozy! Staff very friendly and welcoming! Sangria was thick and fruity and came in a pitcher for $28! Calamari fritti was Light and crispy and paired wonderfully with the lemon arugula salad! My gluten free pizza was the best crust I've had yet! Thin and very crispy! The radiatori pasta with short Ribs was creamy and delicious! We fell in love with the place and plan to return for happy hour block of antipasto and bottle of wine for $20!"}
{"text":"Just ok. Had the pig pizza and the one with that I can't remember it's name but had a hard time eating that one. They were out of the pasta I wanted to order so that was a bummer. I loved their zucchini chips, they were very tasty and addicting.mTheir hazelnut chocolate dessert was very delicious but as far as pizza I would skip and go for their pastas."}
{"text":"A little sad that we weren't offered the complimentary bread and had to ask our waitress for it. I live for free carbs, and my family and I have been here before multiple time, so we know the drill. I ordered burrata tortelloni (butternut squash tortellini) and it was melt in your mouth delicious!   The restaurant is split up into two sections and the section further back has a WINE BAR. I would have taken a picture, but it was incredibly dark. Imagine those tap beer bars, but for wine."}
{"text":"Cute quaint Italian spot, great for Happy Hour or to grab a quick bite.  Helps to have a reservation as it does get packed.  Try the chefs board and the sangria, the zucchini chips are tasty, and the pizza was soooo good!"}
{"text":"I agree with Ashley D.  This place is beautiful, the decor in amazing and the kitchen looks impeccable, however I didn't feel like I want to come back as a place I would like to hang out.  We went with another couple, who suggested the place.  The food is not bad, however it is not memorable.  As a native Italian, I know pasta and pizzas. I stated with the Heirloom Beets salad, that was delicious.  I think my favorite item of the night. For my entree, I had the Tortelloni, they were good, however I think they are overworking the pasta.  There were spots that were really tough at the seams of the pasta.  By the way, the portion for this dish is really small, which for me it ok since I am always watching what I eat.  The filling, made with mascarpone was great.  I was noticing while we were eating at one of the high top tables that one of the kitchen members was beating the heck out of the pasta.  I have to say, though I was coveting their pasta machine.  The wonders of automation, I have to crank my pasta maker.  I think I should get me one of those, before my mom's next visit.  My hubby had the House-made sausage pizza. Again, the dough was so overworked that the pizza was too chewy and not in a good way.  My friend had the Gigli, a pasta with pesto sauce, very nice.  Her husband had The Pig pizza.  He left all the crust since it was too chewy.  The dessert they push is the Salted Caramel Budino, it is good, but as a sweet tooth person, I didn't finish it and that is a lot to say.  Not much dimension or texture, just pudding like textures all the way.  On the other hand, my hubby's dessert, the Affogato was delicious."}
{"text":"I love North Italia. The vibe of this restaurant is great, whether you go for dinner or brunch. I'm a huge fan of Arrogant Butcher, which I believe is the same owner as North Italia so the food is somewhat similar. The food isn't as good as Arrogant Butcher, but it's still very delicious. I had the calamari to start, which was okay. For dinner, I had the very delicious steak and potatoes. My boyfriend had the pasta (I have forgotten which one) and he loved it."}
{"text":"Before going to NoRTH, I thought it would be just another chain formula \"Fox-in-the-box\" type restaurant. Wow, was I mistaken! As a big fan of independent, mom and pop businesses serving up local flavor restaurants, I don't say that very often.  New York Steak The NY steak was perfectly cooked medium rare and deliciously tender.  Not on par with anything from Donovan's or Ruth's Chris, but a solid choice for the money.   Scallops As an avid scuba diver, I love seafood and eat scallops every time I'm near the ocean. These were some of the best I've ever tasted.  Tiramisu I enjoyed the tiramisu, especially the unique way it was served, but I don't feel that it was memorable.  Good, but not great.  Service Our service was attentive without being overbearing.  I appreciated the time our waiter took to review each section of the menu and provide not only suggestions, but commentary on the entrees."}
{"text":"Good food.  Love the set up, the bar and seating area opens to the outside.  GREAT calamari.  Great service.   Busy place.    SUMMERLIN APPROVED !"}
{"text":"First time at North. Had lunch on a Sunday afternoon, drawn to the gluten free options.    For the six of us, we ordered the Happy Hour Bottle and Board, Steamed Muscles, Fonduta, Beet Salad, Tuscan Basil Tomato Soup (2), a side of pasta, Spaghetti and the daily Pizza. We also added a glass of Malbec Red Wine and two cokes for $114. Only $19 per person including apps and drinks. Good deal there.   The charcuterie board was excellent. It had salami, spicy pepperoni, two cheeses, garlicky olives, candied apricot bits, asparagus, bread and some tasty nuts.   For the meals, everyone enjoyed their plate. Mine was the pizza - a white pizza with smoked mozzarella, pepperoni and basil. It was the first white pizza I'd had in 20 years. Excellent pie.   The service is definitely worth mentioning: Melissa gave us the perfect amount of attention, made menu suggestions, had good rapport with her customers and a charming smile. She made our meal better!  We will be returning, with more guests!"}
{"text":"Came back here again with 6 family members. Great as usual. Our server, Chelsea , was the best. Love this placeItalian food in Vegas for my money. Been there several times and always great food with great service. Pictured is app board with full bottle of wine during happy hour for $20 Today Alissa was our server. Ask for her if you want a good dining e"}
{"text":"Love this place so much. Everything on the menu is good and I mean that because I have tried literally everything on the menu. I've been going to North for years and it still holds top places for Italian. Mussels are amazing, the meat board is great, all their pizza and salads and food are great. The calamari salad. I can go on. Can pretty much say anything you get, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I ate at North Italia last night with a group in town for a business trip. The food was delicious, service was amazing, and atmosphere was great! We would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday with my parents. Enjoyed the atmosphere which is always important for me and the food was good but not amazing. I don't mind it being real or authentic Italian as long as the flavors and portions are good. I rarely get an appetizer but for my birthday decided why not. Chose the bruschetta with crescenza cheese, prosciutto, truffle oil and asparagus. It was tasty but I guess I was expecting something similar to what one usually gets at Postinos with several varieties. It was tasty but it they served only one large bruschetta to share. Nothing wrong with that but just different than my expectations.   I found my dish, the spinach tortelloni, a little on the small side portion wise but otherwise very tasty. I tasted my parents dish (my dad got the spicy shrimp pasta dish, a generous portion and what one should expect at $18, mom ordered the burrata salad (which my dad had heard was also on the small side but with the added portion of salmon, a large piece) it was balanced out (however it was $20 for that, quite an expensive salad for what she received).   Wine as good (I ordered a Zinfandel) and the dessert I chose, Nutella trifle was on the house and also very good.   I'd like to come again and see if there are any changes to the menu and/or quality of food but it's reputation is definitely earned and I think it's a great place to grab some drinks and maybe a bite if you're trying to do happy hour."}
{"text":"Great food! Great ambiance! Service needs help but giving them the benefit of the doubt due to being relatively new still."}
{"text":"Fun place to eat while shopping.  There's tons of people and good energy.  Def come for lunch, drinks or appies.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried this place this past weekend, I didn't get the full experience because I didn't actually sit down for dinner instead i put in a order for pick up so this review is solely based on the food and the amount of time it took for the food to be ready which was very reasonable (about 20-25 min). I'm so glad I actually tried this place because everything I got was incredibly tasty. From the margarita pizza to the tortellini, I also ordered the arugula & roasted fennel salad and the heirloom tomato and burrata which were both so light yet so pleasing. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to try a new Italian restaurant, you won't be disappointed as far as how the food tastes!"}
{"text":"I never like strolling into a restaurant near their closing time but we arrived maybe 915p they close at 10p and we didn't feel rushed or like it was an inconvenience for the staff. I've been here when it's busy but it was quiet, maybe a few people at the bar and another table then us (it's a Monday). I can appreciate it both ways, the food is excellent regardless. Our server, Mitchell, was very attentive, proactive, down to earth and friendly - got our orders perfect. Mussels were great, the Caesar salad a bit spicy but good and fig and prosciutto pizza I loved. Warm goat cheese, there's nothing better. On top of the food I just like North for the ambience with the cool lighting, the open kitchen and high ceiling. It's almost like you are dining at someone's farm house:) we will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I live in Carlsbad, CA and always stop in to have our margarita pizza and chicken parm. Glad they finally opened a North in Irvine! :) Highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service and the best happy hour--glass of wine for $4!  I highly recommend the burrata tortelloni. Delicious!  Everything was so good we ate there twice while in Scottsdale for only 4 nights. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Italian place I've ever dined at! I got the white truffle garlic bread as an appetizer and OH MY LANTA was it delicious. My mouth is drooling just thinking about it. Our bartender Ryan was very informative and attentive. I got the local beer Gypsy Fade which was a great balanced IPA. I've never tried any vegas local beers and I'm glad this place carries them. For the entree, I got the Wine Glazed Short Ribs.. it was soooo tender and flavorful, so amazing. As to when I thought it couldn't get any better, I finished off my experience with the Tiramisu dessert and it was worth it. Every bite felt like heaven in my mouth LOL   Definitely dining here again, amazing food and great service! Everyone was so kind and welcoming."}
{"text":"I was so excited to dine here since I loved the one in Cali! We came for lunch and ordered the Chef's Board, the Bacon and Egg Pizza, and The Pig pizza. The Chefs Board was great and had a variety of different items so there were many variations I could try with the bread, which I loved! The Bacon and Egg pizza was good as well. It felt like it was missing something so we threw on some crushed red pepper for a kick and it was amazing. I remember loving the Pig pizza in Cali, so I knew I'd like it here, and it didn't disappoint. Lots of meat in each bite which made it really flavorful.  I knocked off one star because it took awhile to get water refills, and our server asked my friend and I if we wanted dessert while we were in the middle of eating. Literally still had a few slices left so it made us feel rushed.  Everything else was awesome though, and I will definitely be back for dinner to try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great service and awesome interior but food was meh. Squid ink pasta was bland along with their other dishes."}
{"text":"Sunday's at North is always a relaxing experience. We started with the zucchini chips, perfectly sliced then and sprinkled with the right amount of sea salt. Truthfully my egg whites were over cooked, however the white polenta was fabulous and Mike's hamburger, although awkward looking with the focaccia bread, was also delicious."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, So I have to give a 5 star. The portions are small so it's about quality not quantity, left me wanting more. It is pricey for the amount of food you are getting. You can tell everything is made in house for the most part. The ingredients are fresh and good quality. The food is excellent. Not a place if you are really hungry. I could easily eat 3 entrees."}
{"text":"I usually dine at bar north, but my sweetheart wanted to go to north for his bday, so I obliged. We were seated inside, unfortunately, because the place was like a smokehouse. It was so hazy I could taste the smoke and my eyes were dying after 20 minutes.  We had the house specialty salad and tomato soup to start. Soup was amazing, so rich and tasty! The salad was good, but not as great as it sounded on the menu.  For dins I had the salmon and bday boy had short rib pasta. The fish was overcooked and dry. I was sad. The pasta was nice, but the short ribs were awfully fatty from the few bites I had. Meh. For dessert we had the butterscotch pudding and it was fabulous. Best thing all night along with the tomato soup.  The saddest part was that when I made the reservations I was told there was a 25% discount for the night (memorial day) but the bill didn't reflect that. I asked and got the bill reduced, but think that the whole thing is pretty sketchy."}
{"text":"LOUD LOUD LOUD AND LOUD but the food was not bad, the whole experience was annoying from the hostess having us wait in the isle during rush hour, to sitting a couple practically on the lap of our fellow patrons with children. The hummus not great the Osso Bucco left me bored, I should have had a steak. Just Blah"}
{"text":"Great place for dinner or happy hour  & I would highly recommend it. Love the chef's board & zucchini chips for the appetizer. Can't go wrong with the pizza or pasta for dinner. Beautiful atmosphere & service is always top notch. Definitely make reservations. It gets very busy."}
{"text":"the meatballs are the BEST ever.  I do not like any meatballs excpt for my own or my mom's.  BUT North Italia's stack up to those.  They are delicious.  at lunch try the meatball sandwich.  For dessert, try the finger licking bombolini.  Absolutely yummy!!  only complaint was for my daughter's kids burger, it was dry as all can be.  for appetizers, try the calamari and artichoke.  Truly everything you order is wonderful (except the kids burger, which is too bad)"}
{"text":"What can I say another fabulous Fox Restaurant.  We went for happy hour on Sunday. We got a deal deal on a pitcher of sangria with the chefs board. It was something even a snobby italian like myself truly enjoyed. I would recommend this place again and again."}
{"text":"I took the family here for our daughter's birthday and was very impressed.  The wait staff and hostesses went out of their way to make sure we had comfortable seating for our party and our server was extremely knowledgeable about the cocktails and fully explained every dish and what could be modified to suit specific tastes.  We got there near the end of happy hour and ordered a couple of the pizzas and cheese boards which ended up being a great value!  In fact, almost too good of a value because 8 of us almost got full and started discussing what plates to share for dinner.  Every entrée we ordered was prepared perfectly and was delicious.  North executes on every level that an upscale restaurant should."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite restaurant in Kierland. I've been a loyal diner at their establishment for years, although my check-ins don't reflect it.   The location is newly remodeled with an open floor plan and chic design. They have a gorgeous patio for outdoor dining.  I caution against sitting there this time of year (summer), but it's wonderful once the temperatures start to drop.    The menu is great! I always start with the zucca chips (thinly sliced and fried fresh zucchini) -make sure to get a side if lemon wedges and aioli to accompany the dish. The chicken chopped salad, lasagna, strozapretti and fish of the say are always great selections. The restaurant is very consistent with customer service and quality of the food.  Check out North for any occasion - a business lunch, lunch and wine with friends, a date or solo at their bar."}
{"text":"For those of you Napa fans... It's Press with an Italian twist. What an amazing, open, social atmosphere. Ample bar seating for mingling of the singles scene. Amazing drink menu - my favorite is the \"julietta\".  Definitely worth trying out.  I've been a big fan of the North in Scottsdale for years, and really like that they've mixed things up at this new location. Plenty of great appetizers, salads and pizzas... but my favorite - the house made pastas.  In particular, the short rib gnocchi - it's to die for. I haven't (yet) tried any entree items but they sound great.  So... on the negative side, the only thing I can say is I wish they took reservations.  I use OpenTable at the other North, which is super convenient.  At this location, you have to come in and put your name on the list.  Waits have averaged 30 minutes or so, so plan for that."}
{"text":"Came in tonight with my husband for a nice dinner! The ambiance was fantastic which was nothing when compared to our server holland. She was personable and gave fantastic suggestions especially when dealing with my husband's allergy. She was bubbly and personable and really made out experience memorable. We will be back to request her! Thanks north!"}
{"text":"Drinks and Food are superb! Been here over 5 times for dinner and will keep going back.  The ambiance is geared towards more of a fun evening with friends or a date night. Highly recommend their garlic bread, grilled artichokes and arancini. I need to get the Funghi pizza every single time. I am a vegetarian and have never had issues with the chef being able to accommodate my dietary needs. Go there, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"My new found favorite! Love the happy hour chefs board and the Sangria...mmm hmmm. We popped in after an afternoon golf session and enjoyed the chefs board 5/5 which included a plethora of delicious options including: prosciutto di parma, artisan cheese, marinated eggplant, roasted peppers, castelvetrano olives, marcona almonds and some apricot marinade. There were also some small pieces of bread with a little oil that go well with the plate. One great combination is a piece of bread, the apricot marinade and a marcona almond. Mmmm can't wait to come back.   After our first round of drinks we ordered a couple more Sangrias and tried the house specialty bolognese 5/5! The house made noodles were delicious and were served with plenty of sauce. Lastly, we tried the grilled cauliflower which was served with fried egg on top, cauliflower, baby asparagus, toasted breadcrumbs and a delicious pancetta cream.  Only regret is that we didn't save room for dessert :(, gives us something to look forward to our next visit.  The service was great 5/5. We sat at the bar and were catered to the whole time. Thank you North Italia for a wonderful time."}
{"text":"We've been a few times now. Brunch and dinner.  Some items were good and a few misses.  The pig pizza is a clear winner. Short rib dinner entree was good.  Some of the pastas not in love with but will continue to try more menu items.  Bread with Ricotta was good.  Staff nice.  Good lemonade and tea.  Updated 1/15 - went yesterday for brunch and ordered the short rib hash and the breakfast burrito.  We have decided that after a handful of trips to North Italia we are over unimpressed with the showing of items we have tried and will take a rest from trying more items.  I would say the food is average quality and meant to please a crowd."}
{"text":"At first I wasn't impressed with food but kept coming back for the drinks. Then we discovered the meatball appetizer, and the Bolognese pasta dish...Very good! Perhaps my palate has matured our changed or something! Definitely a great spot. They make their pasta in shop.   Great drinks and decent beer selection. Give it a try! Favorite drink : The Julietta, vanilla and ginger infused vodka with prosecco. So ridiculously good!"}
{"text":"Finally, an Italian restaurant in Summerlin that impressed me in every way! From the open kitchen where you can have a personal look at your pasta being hand made, to the great service from the entire staff, to the desserts that make me never want to diet ever in life, this place has it all covered.  Between my visits, I've tried quite a few dishes. The bolognese blew me away, truly one of the best I've ever tasted. The salty crust on the salmon was very unique and flavorful. And the salted Carmel budino is my new favorite sweet snack! I'd also suggest ending your meal with an Italian coffee.  This place is good for date night, family dinner, a ladies outing, or even a solo dinner and glass of wine. In the nicer months, they offer outdoor seating.  As much as I love Honey Salt in the same lot, I'm worried this place may have just taken the spotlight when it comes to semi-fine dining."}
{"text":"This is a convenient place to go for lunch while shopping at Kierland Commons.  The decor is sleek and modern, with soft techno/lounge music playing in the background.  You have the option of sitting at a table inside or relaxing on lower to the ground couches and chairs out on the patio.  The menu is on the lighter side, offering salads, panini, stromboli, and a variety of antipasti and bruschetta options.  Also available were several types of sangria with fresh fruit blended in, and loads of wines.    The bruschetta with fresh tomato, goat cheese, and toasted hazelnuts was delicious.  With only three small pieces in the order, split between three people, I was left wanting more, which I guess wasn't such a bad thing since I still had room for my salad (Turkey Chopped salad with avocado, raisins, almonds, and feta).  I enjoyed the combination of flavors but the chopped deli turkey was a little bit of a disappointment; actual roasted turkey would have been much better.    I tasted the stromboli filled with chicken, braised greens, feta, and carmelized onions (picture an extra-long Hot Pocket cut diagonally into thirds).  It was pretty tasty but the greens were a little too bitter and sort of overpowering.  The portions here are on the small side, so you don't necessarily get much bang for your buck, but Bar NoRTH did the job overall."}
{"text":"We came for Sunday happy hour which is a pretty awesome deal.  The wine was actually pretty good for such a good deal.  Pretty impressive around here.  The chef's board was ok, not a whole lot of cheese by any means.  Maybe because it was a happy hour deal?  It was seriously tantamount to one serving of cheese which is the size of 2 dice.  They tried to make up for it with the vegetables - asparagus, red pepper, some jam..    The daily pizza sounded good with goat cheese and arugula.  What we got was pretty, until you pick up a slice and all this oil drips down puddling into the plate.  It tasted fine, until you started on the other side where the sprinkling of salt on top turned into a heavy toss.  We did the best we can eating the salt lick, but made sure to ask for our next pizza without the extra salt on top.  If only we knew about their practice before!  I'd say the happy hour deals are pretty good and especially on Sunday where it's all day long it's worth checking out for yourself.  Save yourself - ask for no salt added to the pizzas!!  Even if you like a little, you can add it evenly yourself and not risk the kitchen messing up half of it!"}
{"text":"Hostess was overwhelmed when I entered the restaurant at 11:45am. She was taking a carry-out order from a lady standing in front of me, then she answered the phone and promptly asked them to hold, and then explained that they would be on hold for approximately five minutes as she was \"busy\". A group of ladies entered and approached her to say they had reservations, and she asked them to wait so she could assist me since I was next in line. I noticed the hostess area was consistently packed with people \"waiting\" to be seated, throughout my lunch. Clearly, backup is needed! The food and drinks were all tasty: Milano Mule cocktail, Acqua Pana Water, a non-alcoholic  cocktail, an espresso, kale soup, caesar salad, calamari, and tiramisu dessert. Unfortunately, a hair was found in the caesar halfway through lunch. The waitress apologized and offered a new caesar salad, which we declined. Then the manager/supervisor on-duty came to our table to apologize and again offer a new salad. Which we politely accepted the apology and declined the replacement salad. I suspect most people decline a replacement due to the feeling of nausea caused by finding a hair in the meal. Overall, there seems to be some kinks that need to be worked out. Please insist on hairnets during all food-prep activity. Hygiene is imperative."}
{"text":"I went here last night with a party of 6 and I can't believe I've never Yelped this place before.  I've been here several times over the years and pretty much everything to be said has been said on other's Yelp reviews, but here is my overview:  1 - all the food is great, portions good and priced decently 2 - make a reservation - the place gets busy 3 - the place is loud as heck.  I feel like I'm 80 just saying it, but the acoustics of the place are horrible and you have to yell to others in your party during prime time when the place is busy 4 - food comes out fast but I have no idea why you have to wait 10 minutes for another beer or diet coke  Last night I had the short rib over creamy polenta and it was amazingly awesome."}
{"text":"It was the worst experience I ever had. The bread was under cooked & gooey.  The main dishes were tasteless & we had to send 2 back, again not cooked.  The waiter could care less about anything & spilled my glass of wine & did not bother to give me a new glass like I asked for, mine was sticky. It was so noisy you could hardly hear the person next to you. I won't be going back there."}
{"text":"Great Italian cuisine!! Always fresh ingredients and awesome customer service! A great go to when you're in the mood for authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"***The Best Happy Hour I've Found in Scottsdale in the 2 Year's I've Been Here***  My boyfriend and I went to NoRTH last night for Happy Hour. The food was great, the service was excellent and the value was outstanding. It's right across from Barnes and Noble by the fountain. If it's not too hot, it's lovely to sit and watch the children playing in the fountain.  We had the Zucca Chips, Spaghetti and Meatballs (appetizer) and the Chef's Board. There is a Happy Hour special where you can get a pizza or a salad or the Chef's Board and a full bottle of wine for $20.00. In Scottsdale especially, that's a great deal! The only other place that I know that has as good a deal is Il Postino in Phoenix that has a Bruscetta Board and bottle of wine for $20.00 but that is only on Monday and Tuesday after 8PM.   We also had two desserts. I had the Italian salted caramel/espresso custard. I can't remember the official name of it. It was delicious but incredibly rich! My advice is to share a dessert. My boyfriend had an apple crisp dessert. It was okay. I'm not a big fan of apple pie or apple type desserts.     The Chef's Board had a beautiful presentation. There were cheese, nuts, olives, salami, pepperoni, peppers and a dollop of a raisin compote on it. We asked the waiter what was in the compote and he not only described what was in it, but how it was prepared. Very, very impressive! I am a serious foodie and I genuinely appreciate that level of understanding of food.       The total bill was $43.00 and some change for a bottle of wine, Chef's Board, Zucca Chips, Spaghetti and Meatballs (3) and 2 desserts.   I am really looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Incredible dining experience!!!  All the pasta is home made.  Came with a group of friends and literally everything we tried was amazing!!!  I had the chicken pesto pasta, tried the Bolognese and the gnocchi was to die for.  On top of that, we got a few desserts that were incredible.  From the Mussels to the pasta to dessert to the coffee, this place will tantalize your taste buds down to the last bite.  I consider myself a foodie and very hard to please, and I'm walking away a happy man with a very happy stomach.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"I confess:  I've become a Short Rib Hash addict (available on their weekend only brunch menu)!  Soooooo freaking delish!!  Must try!    They treat me like a VIP but also some of them like a 'true Italian family' would.    Now I've been coming to this location for years & have had many of their dishes!  All very yummy!  Rarely had a problem & if I did; they took care of it immediately without me feeling like a bother.  Managers, wait staff & bussers has been very friendly, attentive & always take good care of me.  They make my dining experience here very enjoyable; which always make your food taste even better.   Great atmosphere to enjoy with friends, family & even by oneself!!  Great location in the Arcadia area.   Very nice happy hour (though I do miss having the spaghetti w/meatballs on their original HH menu from long ago ); especially like their all day Sunday HH.    Now this a FOX Restaurant Concepts but please realize this is not simply a chain along with many of his other successful restaurants but is owned & founded by Sam Fox who resides here locally.  So support LOCAL businesses I always say if you can.   Again delicious food with great service!    @eatnorthitalia"}
{"text":"Amazing food & incredible service!!!! Went in for lunch, I have a poultry allergy & sometimes it gets very tricky when it comes to the food I can eat. The entire staff from waitress, manager, kitchen & chef went the extra mile & prepared a special dish tailored to my allergy (they use chicken stock in most menu items). Special thanks to Amanda who made everything happen & provided exceptional service."}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday maybe a little more than an hour before they were closing with a group of 6. Liked the atmosphere of the whole place immediately. They offer valet parking which wasn't necessary(maybe not when our party showed up at least). We were seated right away and greeted by our waitress right away. She got our drinks and dished out the specials answering all our questions and was very helpful with recommendations to the parts of our group that were first timers. The food was excellent starting with the patata pizza, bruschetta and calamari. We were all still trying to decide what to get so we also got the chef's board opting for the combination which didn't last too long. For dinner I got the seared diver scallops which was cooked perfectly on some awesome risotto. Our table got a community bowl of the bolognese our waitress suggested which was as great as she said it would be. All in all a great dinner to which I didn't hear any complaints and would recommend to anyone in the area or looking for somewhere nice to go with a group or on a date."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food- the quality, so fresh and flavorful! Great happy hour. Always good service- This is our go-to place!"}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant in Scottsdale. Great happy hour too. You can beat their ingredients freshness and taste!"}
{"text":"Located in the beautiful Kierland Commons mixed use project, the location is outstanding.  Parking is easy and free, access equally easy and safe.    North Italia's restaurant and ambiance are nice.  Outside seating is provided as well as inside.  Although the chairs and tables are not the most comfortable I have experienced, they do the job.  I was a walk in on a week night.  Although the restaurant was 65% full, I had to wait until a table became available.  My waiter then took 7 minutes to come see me.  I was starving, so I was not pleased with the response time.    But the main reason for the low rating is the food.  I ordered an appetizer and a main.  The fettuccine bolognese in particular were overcooked and most importantly, the pasta was all stuck together.  As if they were just dropped in hot water un-attended.  I was so disappointed that a restaurant, let alone one in Kierland Commons, would serve food this way.  it shows a level of carelessness.  Prices were reasonable.  Although I am a big fan of Italian Food, next time I will look for alternatives to North italia"}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:  Warning! Going to Sam Fox Restaurants for Happy Hour after a movie can be habit forming.   We have heard many good things about this Italian farmhouse concept, but we were little hesitant given that we found the lunch at North in Kierland just okay.  Our caution however, was unwarranted.  AMBIANCE/MOOD: We arrived around four-thirty and the parking lot was mostly empty. Were they open we thought? But as we approached the front door, it was opened by a hostess and we were invited in. Nice.    We said we had come for the Happy Hour and were escorted not to the bar, but to some tables along the back wall. We were given menus, both Dinner and HH and heard a brief explanation of the fish special. Very cozy and very nice. I have taken a few photos of the inside of the restaurant.  The mood is upscale and dare I say 'hip\".  MENU: Like other Fox places, the HH menu is more of a starting point of samplers. For instances, if you like HH serving of freshly made meatballs and spaghetti, then maybe you'll like the lager dinner serving.  The HH menu has about a dozen items, mostly in the $5.00 - $8.00 range.  They have Caesar Salad, Arancini, Pizza of the Day $8, Chef's Board of meats and cheese $10, Zucca chips $3.  Two holdovers from other restaurants are the Castelvetrano Olives $3 and Spiced Nuts $2. These two look similar to the Olive & Ivy's offering. http://www.yelp.com/biz/olive-and-ivy-scottsdale#hrid:XB-E39WNviGs1MkkQ4XIxw  As you would expect, they also have all beers and well drinks priced at $4.00 to $5.00.  But what we found special, are all their wines marked at 50% off.  They will also re-cork it for you to go.  Here are links to the menus: http://www.foxrc.com/frcwp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/North_40th_Menu_Happy_Hour.pdf http://www.foxrc.com/frcwp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/North_40th_Dinner_Menu2.pdf  SERVICE: We found the service to be very professional.  Yes, the water glasses were refilled on a timely basis, but also the wait staff comes by and chats with you about your food and answers any questions you have very knowledgeably.  We actually got into a very detailed discussion on Washington State wines and Oregon Pinots with our server Vail.  FOOD: We started off by ordering a Washington State Chardonnay, but found they didn't have any chilled.  We then opted instead for the Snoqualmie Riesling, which was somewhat sweet, with a hint of cherries.  We tried the HH Caesar Salad for $5.00 and the HH Spaghetti, also for $5.00. The salad came with some of the most delicious croutons that had a smokey taste we have ever had.  A definite must.  The spaghetti was equally interesting and flavorful.  The meatballs must be cooked in a marinara, and has a complexed layering taste which was different than the pasta sauce, which has a hint of fennel. Wow.  Next we ordered the Margherita Pizza ($11.00) off the Dinner menu, see photos. It was very good but we found the cheese slipped off when you bit into a wedge.   For dessert, we each ordered the Gelato scoop for $3.00 and the Tiramisu for $6.00, both off the dinner menu.  I've taken pictures of the Titamisu.  It came in a glass ramekin with an amazing amount of delicious mascarpone cheese and flavorful Kahlua.  PRICES: Our petite Happy Hour dinner of six items, ran us $41.50 before taxes and gratuities.  It also included the bottle ($23.00, 50% off) of Riesling, which our wonderful server Vail re-corked for us. As we left, the parking lot was full with a dozen cars waiting to be parked.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is the bee's knees! Bruschettas fantastic meatballs on my favorite! love the cocktail choices! A very fresh bright place to hang out at."}
{"text":"This is a delicious Arcadia restaurant. I seem to gravitate towards the truffle garlic bread and  the seasonal vegetable salad with arugula instead of kale. Add salmon to the salad for a bit a protein. For dessert, the salted caramel bundino is a must try treat! Other delicious dinner options include the ricotta gnocchi and the spaghetti and meatballs. If you join between 3-5pm, enjoy happy hour pricing of $5 glasses of wine and select appetizers."}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes for a salad? Our server didn't check on us and we had little ones with us. The kitchen was backed up... It is a restaurant right, it's what you do?  Too bad, we have given this place a chance and every time the service is lacking. Go when you have plenty of time and aren't hungry, it takes a long time to get your food."}
{"text":"Wow! Ricardo was our server and we had great service from start to finish. What really made our experience amazing was the ending. Matt the AGM, I believe, was so incredibly nice and sent us out dessert. It is small acts like that, that make people turn into regulars at a restaurant. Thank you so much Ricardo and Matt!!! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Scottsdale Location:  Average food and service very casual vibe and service and quality to match.  Not really home cooking but rather fast casual semi processed tasting.  It's just not my thing as when it comes to Italian food, sauces, breads, pasta you are far better off at a mom and pop restaurant not a large chain like North.  There is simply noting unique or special to want to show off to anyone here.  The decor and location is nice."}
{"text":"Incredible!  Love, love, loved it. **nailed it**. Such a great atmosphere.  The food was incredible and the service top notch.   I would definitely recommend North to anyone looking for one of the best restaurants phoenix has to offer.   Amazing!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We loved the atmosphere and the decor! What we loved more is the food!! We ordered a simple salad to start which was not simple! With green, tomatoes, pine nuts and Gorgonzola cheese it was delicious!  We also ordered the chicken Parmesan which was a tad burnt on the edges but still very tasty. In addition we also ordered the very traditional spaghetti and meatballs which was perfect in every way. The noodles were cooked to perfection! We ended our meal with the tiramisu which was probably the least traditional interpretation of the dessert I've ever had, but it too, was wonderful! We will be back!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Vegas. I'm a big fan of everything I've tried so far, especially the bolognese and the mushroom pizza, honestly one of the best pizzas I've ever had. The vinegar they use with the complimentary bread is so yummy I could drink it! Also, the Sunday brunch is so delicious! And I can't forget the coffee drinks, some of the best coffee I've ever had.  The bar can get a little backed up, (totally understandable for a busy spot during peak hours) but other than that the service is outstanding."}
{"text":"I live in the area and eat here all of the time. The service today was the worst I've ever experienced, including dirty wine glasses with a ten minute wait for a new glass, a forgotten appetizer as well as the wrong entree. By the time we were able to flag down our server it then took about another 20 minutes to get the correct order. I was compensated for the entree, however expect much more from a Sam Fox restaurant. Even a proper apology would have gone a long way here. North is a great restaurant and hope that they can clean up their service to rise up to their reputation."}
{"text":"A Great little neighborhood eatery in the heart of Phoenix. Good vibes and openness of ambiance. Good for foodies, Italian lover's paradise from their salads to their pastas."}
{"text":"We went here for my boyfriends birthday and it was the best dining experience we've had in ages. We loved the open layout and ambiance, service was exceptional and the food was delicious. We started with a few items off the happy hour menu including the \"chefs board\" and a bottle of wine for $20 which was such a great value and so good. We then shared the diver scallops with risotto entree and tiramisu fo dessert which were both amazing. All high quality, fresh ingredients and the prices were very reasonable. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I love going to North whenever I'm in town! The pasta is fresh and sauces are delicious. The ambiance is the best thing about this place. We sometimes just go for the ambiance and order a dessert and coffee to share. They have a cute little bar. One of the better fox concept restaurants!"}
{"text":"Another overrated Italian food chain. Nothing great about the food except for the service."}
{"text":"Went there to eat on a Sunday afternoon around 2pm and we were hungry.  This is my second time eating at this establishment. Service was terribble for the low volume of customers in the restaurant.  Had to wait an unreasonably long time for our food.  I ordered ice tea with my meal and because the glass is small, I had to repeatedly ask for refills and no straw or sugar provided. Ordered calamari and it was petrified.  We were offered bread the first time we tried the restaurant and never offered bread this time and a server told us it is because it is up to the descretion of the server. There were just two of us and the total bill was over $70 for lunch. Fortunately, there are many other options for good italian food here in Summerlin (Pasta Idea) that is less pricey. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Homemade pasta and pizza... Awesome. Calamari... Horrible.  Overall amazing vibe, if you want bread be sure to ask for it right away and don't miss out on the amazing cocktail menu.  Would have given 5 stars, but the calamari was not fresh or cleaned properly... The solution? I don't order calamari here anymore and everything else is AMAZING."}
{"text":"Dogs, dogs, dogs!!! Literally dogs everywhere you could see. Our waitress kept going over rubbing a dogs belly, then immediately bringing out food. Another table kept letting the dog ON THE TABLE. So disgusting.   Food was average. Service was average. I was really looking forward to a fun new neighborhood spot"}
{"text":"Comfortable atmosphere and extremely friendly staff made dining here enjoyable!  Did I mention food was deliciously prepared! Mmmm . My only regret was skip on the desert I ordered a very sweet and rich salted Carmel semi freddo. Kinda ruined my delicious meal as it was way too salty"}
{"text":"Came here with my handsome husband and friends before the Jo Koy comedy show. We had reservations made and when we arrived we were seated right away.  If you haven't been to this location, parking is pretty much mandatory. Don't worry it's complimentary, just be kind and leave the valet guys a couple bucks when you leave.  The vibe is SO different than the Kierland Commons location. This location is way more hip, way louder and the energy is much better. They have gender neutral bathrooms which is awesome too.  ******SERVERS*****MANAGEMENT****   If you know it's happy hour, tell your customers! Our server didn't tell us it was happy hour, it wasn't until we overheard him answer the couple next to us about the happy hour they were having. It was now 3 minutes after 6 and we asked him about getting a HH menu. He said he would still honor the prices but what he should have done was told us AND given us the HH menu the moment we sat down.   Anyway, we got the zucca chips that was on the HH menu and we also go the mussels not on the HH menu and both were spectacular. For dinner, my husband and I ordered and shared a Cesar salad, awesome dressing and the croutons were to die for.  For dinner, husband and I shared the Short Rib Radiatori.  Pasta with Parmesan cream, fresh horseradish, wilted arugula, herbed breadcrumbs. It was freaking out of this world.  If you're in the area, try North, you won't be disappointed and your taste buds will forever love you."}
{"text":"This Italian style eatery is located inside the rampart commons shopping center right next to Pottery Barn. This petite corner strip mall is lined up with affluent boutiques along with a couple dining options like Honey Salt and PF Changs.  We enjoyed the fresh, modern vibe and the outdoor covered patio looked like a fabulous place to dine when the weather cooperates. Indoors, they have open windows lining the back wall giving us the perfect view inside the kitchen at all of the bustling chef action. The service was very friendly from start to finish. But unfortunatly, most of the food we tasted was lacking flavor and love.   I wouldn't come here with high expectations for anything in particular. I also feel that the cuisine fits with New American/Italian fusion at best.  Their price point didn't match the way the plates were served; I was not thrilled with the presentation of the food. Value is hard to find here, especially when you have a lot of local, non-chain, Italian restaurants to choose from.  If I had to recommend something, try the arancini mushroom risotto balls and make sure to save room for the tiramisu, this spot adds clusters of crunch balls to the top which gives it an addictive texture.  Appetizer: Grilled cauliflower rated: 3/5  Arancini fried mushroom risotto balls rated: 4/5  Pizza: Prosciutto pizza rated: 3.5/5  Dinner entree:  Squid Ink malfadine rated: 3.5/5 Beef filet rated: 3.5/5  Dessert:  Tiramisu rated: 4/5  Cocktails: Sangria rated: 3.5/5 The IGT rated: 3/5"}
{"text":"This restaurant and their management is top notch. As you can see from our review below we had a bad experience with our take out order this evening. Well! the manager, Chris contacted us personally and made it right. Chris tells us he is the manager but with his dedication to his customers and this restaurant I would think he is the owner. I honestly believe our experience was a one time mistake that North Italia corrected immediately. They are even changing their take out containers to make sure the quality of their delectable food is protected on its trip to your home's table. I am extremely impressed with North Italia and I am highly recommending this restaurant to anyone looking for an incredibly delicious meal and the best service you will ever have. Thank you Chris, we will see you soon.    -----  This 2 stars is for their take out only. We are very unhappy! We love North and we eat there whenever we can. It is normally delicious. Tonight we ordered take out and it was horrible. Not only are their take out containers made of paper and soak up all the sauce but they completely ignored our order. When we finally got someone to check on our order it had been sitting on their counter for 10 minutes. We spent $65.00 for ice cold dinners that were terrible. We are very upset by the lack of concern the restaurant staff had towards their take out customers."}
{"text":"Excellent food and pizza. I am very happy they now have opened one in Irvine, CA. We'll be visiting them more often, than once a year, when I am visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I went with my cousins and friend for a mini bridesmaid lunch after some wedding shopping. This place had the most amazing food and drinks.  We started with the cauliflower appetizer.  It had an over easy egg, asparagus and some really delicious flavors. We all decided to try the daily pizza which was an Eggplant Pizza. It was very flavorful and I would have never thought that eggplant would be good on pizza but it was perfect.   For our main course we each orders a salad. The Italian Farm and the seasonal veggie salad. Holy moly! The flavors and veggies were so full of flavor. The salami in the Italian Farm had great flavor. I can honestly say that the salad was probably the best salad I have ever had. The dressing was a light vinaigrette and it was perfect!  For drinks we had the Strawberry Spice Mule, which is now my favorite drink, the Bellini and the Red Sangria. All the drinks were delicious and they were very generous with their alcohol. The service was excellent and overall this place is a must visit.   I'm from LA and had to see if there was one close to home and thankfully there is. Irvine here I come to get the cravings I will def need!  Thanks North Italia!!"}
{"text":"I am a picky diner. Not so much in the kinds of food, but rather, the quality vs. the price. Obviously flavor has a big role in dining however, I am one who believes that you should get what you pay for.   That being said, this place had very flavorful great quality tasty food at a price that was quite reasonable.   The clientele seems to be a mixed crowd leaning towards the younger professional. It was also a fine place to take a child as we had our 2 year old with us.   They did us the courtesy of bringing out out daughter's cheese pizza first to get her settled in prior to our meals arriving.  When her pizza arrived, I was envious. I really wanted a slice!  I did steal a taste and found the sauce and cheese to be way above average for Phoenix. The dough was on par with wood fired pizza dough, which I find a little less rich than the Boston style pizza I prefer.  My wife ordered the pesto chicken and I ordered the chicken Parmesan. I tasted my wife's and found the sting fresh basil to be top notch.  To put it plainly, my meal was perfect. The flavor was wonderful, ingredients of high quality, and portions were right in for a meal.   Fox restaurants have yet to let me down. Don't miss this place. You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I don't know the history of the building, but it looks like a barn that was redecorated into a restaurant. The decor is rustic/chic yet modern, which works perfectly. It's a great place for a date, a birthday, anniversary, or just a fun night out. Our server was very attentive; we didn't have to wait for anything. It seemed like the moment the water or wine glass was near empty, he was right there to refill it. We told him it was our first time there and we got free zucchini chips! They were a little salty, but seriously addicting. My friend and I told the server that we were sharing the chicken parmesan and the spinach tortelloni. We were pleasantly surprised when the two dishes were served in half-size portions to each of us, so we didn't even half to split our meals. The food was AWESOME!! The pasta was fresh and the sauces and toppings were absolutely perfect. Flavorful, delicious, and amazing. I would highly recommend North and I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Ask for Derek because he is a great waiter."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a beautiful interior, nice setting. The service is spotty, the food is ok, but over priced for what it is. We paid $90 for an appetizer, a mediocre pasta and a desert. We did not have alcohol, I think its overpriced."}
{"text":"The evening began with us showing up 25 minutes before our reservation. I suggested we get a drink while we wait. We went to the bar where the bartender was chatting up 2 girls at the end of the bar. There was also another couple at the bar eating. We stood there for at least 5 minutes. I am in the F&B business and I know that feels like a lifetime. When he did notice us he wanted to make with the pleasantries, I wanted a drink. He took the order and went back to finish his conversation. He was just as lackadaisical when we were called for our table and needed to pay.  Now then, we were sat and the the rest of the meal was a delight. Chx parm, braised ribs, the Pig and bolognaise . Food was good as was the service and to be fair the Dirty Martin's were good. I just like to have a staff that is aware of their surroundings."}
{"text":"Fantabulous! That's the best way I can describe the food here.  I really wanted to get a photo of my dish, because it was a work of art, despite just being pasta et al piled onto a plate. Unfortunately, between my hunger and the amazing aroma wafting off the plate, the camera never made it out. This dish, by the way, was the strozzapreti. I could go on about how wonderful it was, but I'll spare the reader. Oh, there were also the Zucca chips. I nearly bit the waiter's hand off when he tried to remove the scraps.  In truth, I would love to give this place 5 stars. The food, without a doubt, warrants that rating. However, the place was pretentious to the point that it was palpable. The acoustics of the restaurant made for a very loud experience. Oh and the server was actually a bit too attentive. She was great, very nice, on top of everything... but just a little too much.  Overall I'd like to go again and try out some more of what they have to offer! (And of course, have more zucca chips...)"}
{"text":"Located in the same shopping center as Honey Salt, this restaurant is brimming with people, it is recommended to have a reservation at dinnertime. It took them about an hour or so (peak evening) to seat us.  They have an assortment of pastas and pizzas. The margarherita pie fresh from the oven, the squid ink pasta has a spicy kick with a nice portion of calimari + shrimp.  There was a mixup of one of our friend's dishes ans had to be sent back. The response time was prompt and understandable given how packed it is. Seems that the workers met the challenge with success"}
{"text":"This place was incredible! The service was spot on! The building and decor were incredible. The complimentary valet was seamless. The food was the best! My wife had gluten free noodles and my son had gluten free pizza, both said it was some of the best they have ever had! Great experience and will definitely be back next time we are in Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time dining at this restaurant... food was excellent... atmosphere and ambience were pleasant and inviting... the service by Jordyn was extremely good... looking forward to our next visit... thank you very much indeed..."}
{"text":"This was my second trip to Arizona that we went to visit north italia and what can i say in 2 days we ate diner there 2. The food was just so good we could not resist coming for a second time.   The food at this restaurant is really out of this world. All of the food is made fresh onsite and you can taste the effort they put into all the food. The spaghetti noodles are hollow in the inside for more flavour the garlic bread has just the right balance of everything including garlic truffles and cheese. The service was good as well as the ambiance."}
{"text":"Talk about a great experience I had here last night (12/12/14). Started with the awesome hostess (short, red hair). Even though we ended up sitting at the bar,  she was willing to work some magic to get me in, considering it was a Friday night and I had not made a reservation. The bar staff was very attentive and quick to refill a drink or make sure you had your order in.   Now, the food was overall pretty good. I felt the meatballs were a bit underwhelming, but the main courses were great. The manager Chris though, he is the star of this place. He came over during our meal asked how everything was and genuinely cared. My mom, who I was treating to dinner, had the rosemary chicken, and while she liked it, was not blown away. Chris wouldn't have this. He specifically went back to the kitchen and had them re-do it to the nines. When it returned, she was more than impressed. We were already willing to return and give the place another try. But with this kind of service, I'm definitely sold, and going to recommend it to everybody I can.  Great place!"}
{"text":"This is a busy place so make a reservation.  The food is excellent.  The rosemary pan roasted chicken is by far the best I've had anywhere and I'm particular, a foodie and love to cook.   I make it at home and they do it right.  The bolognese pasta is also very good.  We order it as an appetizer and share it.  We didn't order the pizza and it is definitely on our list.  Enjoy!  We did ."}
{"text":"I would normally review a newer restaurant that I enjoyed to help jumpstart their business. This is not the case as North has already taken off on its own merit. The menu is not extremely extensive but is varied enough that I would order something different each time I return. We were a group of 9 so I did have the luxury of tasting many items. They were all very good, the pizzas, pasta, and salmon. The above sensational service provided to us by Gianna is what motivated me to write this. She made us feel as though we were the only table she was servicing. Whether it was a suggestion on what  and how to order for a group, to making certain our drinks were topped off, to making sure there were always enough appetizer plates for us. This was all done with a pleasant smile. She made a special occasion that much more joyous for us all. Thank you North and thank you Gianna!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I come here a lot. Each time we dine, we get five star service and the food is delicious. A great place to make enjoyable memories."}
{"text":"The food here is great. The Chitarra has pasta in a butter sauce with sweet potatoes.... and greens..... so yummy!!! I always sit at the bar because the drinks are coldest here. Great place, the smell alone is enough!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were both really good. We had the truffle garlic bread, pesto pasta and margarita pizza. All 3 were excellent. I also had apple bourbon sour  and apricot lemonata. Both good drinks."}
{"text":"North is a wonderful place to go eat on Sunday.  The food is amazing and you can't beat the price.  The Pig pizza is the best!! Especially the valet company that works there. Love Go Green Valet, they know us by name and keep are car close and will have it running when we walk outside to the valet stand ready for us."}
{"text":"Had lunch with three friends and thoroughly enjoyed food, service and prices. Recommendations from jackie, server, were most helpful. Will be back again and again.  So glad to have North in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Last night after landing back in Phoenix after a week of traveling under my belt/wings again, my boyfriend took me for dinner at North Italia in Arcadia. I have had this FRC place on my 'must try soon' list for some time. I had to dodge in after our car was valeted, (complimentary, btw), and get out of my poly/wool/mostly poly tho uniform that would def show who I work for and what I do when I work; yeah. That's always good for some looks. Girl with wings on on a Saturday dodging right into a restaurants restroom for a quick change and hair down so she can have the much needed drink after flying all week! So 3 minutes later I am a new looking girl and we were promptly seated. Our table was 'European style' seating: small table for two next to other twos near the open Italian kitchen. Our waiter was on it and right there to take our orders, but my boyfriend let him know we needed a few minutes to collect ourselves and do a quick catch up. He was sweet and said that since we had our drinks, a pitcher of the red sangria my boyfriend had stocked us with while waiting at the bar for my quick-change and our table, he would check with us in a few minutes and that there was no rush. That is nice because how often are you seated and felt rushed to order?! Our red sangria was just sweet enough and yet not too sweet made with blood orange and brandy to cut too much 'sweet' out. We decided on ordering a few small plates for nibbling with our sangria. We ordered the combo of charcuterie of meats and cheeses and seasonal roasted veggies. It also came with a great sweet/tart chutney that paired nicely with the fresh mozzerella and spicy salami. The bread, which is house made, and one of things you can see in the open kitchen concept, was toasted and amazing. That could have been my entire dinner, happily! We also shared the roasted artichoke that comes with a alioli for dipping. Just enough garlic and tad of parmesan cheese and roasted nicely. Our favorite small plate tho was the Fonduta. Rich melted, warm Italian cheese served in a black iron pan and topped with a sweet tomato jam for dipping more toasted bread in. We were full after sharing these small plates. The menu is very vast: PIzzas,homemade pastas, meats and seafoods to pair with a nice wine/local beer list and several housemade cocktails with a Italian spin on most. We stayed and moved over to the bar because we liked the ambience and vibe of North so much. We had another wine and our friends joined us. We ALMOST had dessert because that menu also looked so tempting. This place is another FRC great. The patio looked amazing with a huge fireplace that had a roaring fire; outdoor seating to the bar; clean restrooms and cool decor. That coupled with a great menu and vibe and fresh made entrees all make for a great place! Oh. There is also, The Rocket. North's 'food truck' that does private events. We asked about it as it drove into the North parking lot. Apparently it has a brick oven on board! NOW, I am wondering what I can book and use The Rocket for! Cool idea! Thanks for the great night, North!"}
{"text":"First time in Great service, fast, so fresh and clean - just really good food. The dark chocolate tart is stupid good. You must try this place !"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite places to eat in North Scottsdale. The atmosphere is delightfully peaceful but yet screams excitement. Two of my favorite resturant entrepreneur's are Rick Bayless, in Chicago, and Sam Fox.  Both these men shit liguid gold when it comes the geniusness of restaurant concepts.  The staff is as warm and friendly as the pope is.  My date and I walked in and were greeted with a \"Welcome back, Kelly.\" She works in the hospitality industry and seems to know almost everyone.  We sat down and within a min out server was over getting our drink order. After throwing out my witty sarcastic comments at him, we ordered. She ordered a sangria and I got suckered into the special drink they were offering. It was called the Valente and I was on cloud nine when it hit my lips. Jim Beam, red bell pepper, basil, lemon juice and honey. I sucked that down like I was in the Sahara and found water after a week without any. It was magical. Kelly looked at me like I was an alcoholic when I ordered another. After deliberating over the amazing menue, it was time to order. We both decided to get pizza's and share. She ordered the mushroom and arugula pizza and I got the sausage and pepperoni. Good fire brick pizza is my favorite food right behind ribs and NoRTH is the best in Phoenix. Your dumb if you dissagree. I made that pizza my bitch and dominated it but leaving 2 slices for lunch the next day. Well that was my intent. It didnt last long after I stepped through my front door.  I will always recommend any of the Fox Restaurant Concepts restaurants to any and all my friends/enemies"}
{"text":"If you like Fox Restaurants, you have to try North! Like all of the other concepts, this restaurant has a great atmosphere and trendy interior, and the service is great as well. Our server was really friendly and helpful, and made sure to get our drink orders on happy hour when there wasn't much time left, which I always think is nice.   I didn't pay much attention to the wine and cocktail list, but they have a really great selection of beer --lots of local choices. For an appetizer we got the calamari, which they pair with arugula. We thought that was interesting since we've never seen it before, but it was great! I definitely recommend trying it.  For dinner we got The Pig pizza, and it was delicious. I would say I've had other pizza I liked more, but my boyfriend thought it was great. Maybe next time I'll try asking for less soppressata because it was really salty, but that's just me :)   The dessert looks amazing too, we'll definitely come back to try it sometime!"}
{"text":"Came here spontaneously because the team & I were around the shopping area by foot. We were looking for a place to eat dinner & stumbled upon this restaurant with outdoor seating. Service was good from the moment we walked in. I had to give this place three stars because all of the food we ordered were just okay. Their in-house pasta texture was great all around. However the taste for everything wasn't out of this world. We had the bruschetta (which I enjoyed the most), balsamic & goat cheese salad with avocados & onions, spaghetti, gnocci horseradish pasta, & spicy shrimp pasta. Other than the mediocre food, the tables were really close together. I couldn't help but hear all of the conversations around us. Overall this place would be one of the ones I would honestly go back to but not choose first. Try it!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty delicious, but a bit too pricey. The atmosphere makes this place a must-visit, but won't be for everyone."}
{"text":"So this is my current Sunday All day Happy Hour JAM!  This place is SO GOOD and I'm not a huge fan of all off Fox Restaurants concepts.  The Chefs Pizza of the day hasn't let me down yet... We don't even ask we just order it!  The Chefs Board is pretty good too! My fav dish right now is the Broccolini - super simple but it's just so light / fresh and make sure you try the Bucatini & Meatballs if your their for happy hour.   Awesome open feel to it - super friendly staff. The bartenders are great - I wanna say the dark haired brunets name was Nicole - works weekends & knows how to make a mean bloodymary / Red Rooster in their case.   The parking / Valet situation is a little annoying but remember the sign says \"Complimentary\" not Mandatory - park your car yourself if you want."}
{"text":"Had a business lunch here recently and just love the restaurant. Our server was new; but, he was being trained by another waitress. Both were equally friendly and enthusiastic about the menu and were very attentive to our table. We were seated on the protected patio outdoors--but I enjoyed the decor and lighting inside, as well. Sort of \"urban farmhouse\". Two of us at the table order the chopped kale salad and the other had a pizza with a variety of meats on top. For drinks we just had ice tea which was fine. The chopped kale salad absolutely hit the spot. It was mixed in with little bits of diced pancetta, egg, tomato, and gorgonzola. The dressing was light and bright and really enhanced the flavor of the kale. The salad was very filling. I  had a hard time choosing after looking at the other tables around us, as everything looked and smelled delicious and was brightly prepared and presented. I'm pleased to learn that we have a North restaurant as well in Colorado and hope to visit there soon to try some of the pizza and other salads!"}
{"text":"Im only giving one star because I HAVE TO!  Strike 1 - we waited almost 45 min after the hostess ensured we will only wait 15. NOT COOL   Strike 2 - its my gf birthday and we would of loved a nice romantic dinner with great Italian wine upon arrival to the table the server approached us rushed and almost scared lol. (I remember my first day) given we are easy so we gave em time after almost 20min for even ordering wine the server had no Italian wine knowledge and recomened a domestic wine I forgot what it was but for 80$ I would of rather has something exotic  Strike 3 - our food was cold at this point we were just over it for being a chain restaurant  they sure choked and we almost did too with the chewy Calamari then how is a pizza even cold dont you cook it 1st ? So confused!  Chicken parm was soggy like it was sitting in sauce really disappointed for this place Will post pictures soon!!!!!  I'll have to try the new Italian place at redrock."}
{"text":"This would actually be another 2.5 Star experience but I went ahead and rounded it up to 3 stars since I am in a good mood.  We came here after going to Chelsea's Kitchen down the street which was super packed for the night.  I easily get annoyed with complementary valet parking because I hardly ever carry cash and feel weird if I do not tip the valet boys and girls but I digress....  The concept and look of this place is really fun and different.  I felt like I was in a modern barn.  We walked in and put our name on the list and was surprised that it is all done by an i-Pad and you receive a text message when your table is ready.  Good thing the bf and I remembered our phones or else we would have been out of luck.  The wait wasn't horrible.  We went to the bar and got a couple of glasses of wine, the bartenders didn't seem really in a hurry to help us which got me a little annoyed.  We were seated in a cozy, and I mean cozy 2 top table right in a main traffic way.  My bf and I are not big people and felt uncomfortable in the size of the table.  I know you want to pack a lot of tables in a small space but at the expense of the customer?  Our waiter was friendly enough but not as friendly as he was to the group of women that was seated next to us.... nothing like treating all your tables equal huh?  We ordered an appetizer, the zucca chips, which had a decent flavor but were a little burnt.  We ordered out main dishes which were a chicken dish and their version of spaghetti and meatballs.  The wait for the food wasn't bad either but I hate when you as the customer have to ask for a wine list because your wine was empty for 10 minutes but the waiter didn't ask if you wanted anything else because he was focused on the table of 5 women next to us sharing an appetizer.    I had the pasta and meatballs, which was me'h.  The pasta was a little mushy and the meatballs really didnt have much flavor.  My bf had the chicken dish with spinach which he loved!  All in all the experience wasn't bad but wasn't good.  Maybe they are still working out their kinks but this place probably won't be high on my list to return any time soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Meatballs ...spaghetti delicious...do they put butter in their tomato sauce?  Is that the extra richness.  Hip and cozy.  Will return without question."}
{"text":"Just excellent! Friendly and attentive staff, space is beautiful, and food is delicious! Arancini balls, handmade tortelloni, short rib, and tiramisu......all spot on. Even the biscotti that came with my friend's panna cotta was one of the best I've ever had. Unfortunately, they were out of a bottle of wine that we wanted, and one of the desserts. We'll forgive them this time ;) Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The food at North is tasty and interesting.    The service was horrific.  It isn't clear if this bad service was an indicator that the hostess sat the server's table badly, or if our server was just incompetent.  She took 15 minutes to come say hello, another 15 to get our orders (while she was busy clearing other tables), and then tables around us, who sat after us, were served their food well in advance to our food arriving.  There are enough restaurants in Arcadia to spend money, with servers that appear to care about doing their jobs well.  Not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Another great Fox Concepts Restaurant...no surprise here!  The space is absolutely great - amazingly bright and open.  The service is extremely quick at lunch which is much appreciated.  And...the food was great!  My pasta was flavorful and just the right portion.  I am confident this place will be a huge success and imagine it is pretty hard to get a table at peak times."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Every time I visit here, I am not disappointed. My favorites are the chef board, pizza and short rib pasta. They are sooo yummy. Ooh, the zucca chip too. So good. they offer great happy hour...especially Sunday (happy hour all day). The price is right and everything is exceptional. Give this place a try if you haven't. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It seems North Italia gets rather busy and you generally won't be able to find a place to park, forcing you to use valet.   The inside of North is an open concept environment. You can see each and every person sitting at their table as well as at the bar. Due to the atmosphere, I wouldn't recommend North for a romantic date simply because it's noisy and there's no privacy. However, this would make a decent setting for a fun and social get together.  After ordering our entrees, it took quite some time for them to come out. Unfortunately, the wait was not worth our food being undercooked and my date getting sick from her meal.  I'll give North one more shot to redeem my initial experience."}
{"text":"Love North Italian Food. This is one of the best restaurants in Phoenix. This location is always busy - for good reason: the food is really amazing. Recommendation: chicken parm. Also, they will text you when your table is available so you can explore Kierland. Put your name in then go shopping then be prepared for the best italian food you will ever eat."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good. I think I have written about it before, but the chicken parm - bar none - best in the country. I get a modified version with red sauce all the way, but both ways are good. Place is busy tonight, but the servers are on point and very attentive - 5 stars. I can be demanding on service, and often reduce ratings for bad service, so this is good -- well done North. You get 5 stars. :)  ... Also adding a shout out to Pat and Josh -- go green valet."}
{"text":"Food is good but the inside of the restaurant is extremely noisy and it is hard to have a conversation. Next time I would only go there if seated outside!"}
{"text":"Fox Restaurants can do no wrong and North is another great argument for that. I've actually only ever been to the bar section, but I love the atmosphere and they serve the full menu, so why stray? The menu changes to keep up with the seasons, but all of their simple Italian dishes are consistently good and fortunately they always keep their zucca chips on! Comfortable seating on the patio, which faces the middle of the Kierland courtyard, can't be beat. They even have heaters for when the sun goes down and their house red, a delicious Montepulciano, keeps tempting you with just one more glass."}
{"text":"Dropped into this place for an early Saturday dinner. Place was packed which was a good sign but was seated fairly quickly regardless. Waitress was very good without being overbearing. Food was pretty good for Phoenix as Italian is not a strong suit in this town at all. I also appreciate the fact they make fresh pasta in house which was evident after eating the food. I had the ricotta gnocchi which was very tasty and my wife had the bacon and eggs pizza which was also excellent, and in my opinion way better than pizzeria bianco down the street that everyone raves about (I have no idea why). A few negatives which knocks this place down a few stars are first this place is very noisy, so much if fact it is very difficult to have a conversation without yelling across the table. My advice for anyone that wants a more intimate setting is to find another place, or maybe sit outside as the noise kills the mood. The other is while i was finishing my beer I put my mug down with a little over 1/3 left and a waiter came by and swiped it off the table before I could even notice assuming I was done. Really? If I am paying $7 for a CAN of beer you better make sure I am done, and even more maybe ask me if I am done?"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Italian food and one of the best looking places. We've been here a few times but the most memorable was on New Years Eve. They had an amazing set menu where every item we tried was spectacular. Always friendly service as well."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp (of course) and my husband I came here for lunch.  We sat outside on a beautiful not so hot day.  We had great service and delicious food.  We ordered the following:  Grilled Cauliflower ($10).  So good, I'm not a fan of cauliflower but I will make this dish an exception.  It also had grilled asparagus, toasted breadcrumbs (next time no breadcrumbs, it took away the flavor of the dish), pancetta cream, lemon and a fried egg.  This was a great dish!  The Pig Pizza ($15) - With all the cured meats, it made the pizza very salty.  It was still really good but I will do without it next time.   Heirloom Beet Salad ($11) -  I love beets and this is a delicious salad.  It also had apples, hazelnut, cheese and lemon crème fraiche.  Delicious!  Bolognese ($16)- Excellent!!!  Full of flavor, I can eat this all day!  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"AMAZING.  I used to frequent a North location in Austin, and this is just as good if not better.  We went for dinner and of course had the pasta which is homemade and like pillowy fluffy clouds that melt in your mouth.  Drinks are good too, very well made.  Only bad thing is parking as anyone who is familiar with the plaza knows how terrible the situation is there.  Best to valet.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and had a bottle of wine, meatballs and short rib gnocchi.  Wine: their \"feature\" Italian red. Mediocre at best but the price was ok $48.  Meatballs: bland and boring Gnocchi: strange dish that doesn't make sense. It had a weird cream sauce and the short ribs needed to cook longer. The mustard overpowered everything. The dish was kinda gross and it made my wife and I ill.  Atmosphere: cool place but so noisy we couldn't really talk to each other.  Service: ok but we had to ask for water to be refilled.  I don't get the reviews.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"I LOVED THIS PLACE!   From the decor, food options and food, all things are a go.  A homemade pasta, and specialty pizza location they did not disappoint. We chose this restaurant as the pre marathon meal, and had some appetizers and entrees. No drinks involved.   For appetizers- they do give bread and oil, however PRO TIP- get the truffle garlic bread. It's immaculate. You won't be disappointed. Trust me. Do it. And take that extra bread and put that ricotta on it. Amazing. I want this all the time.   entrees- I chose the strazapetti, changed the sauce for just oil (Marathon the next morning, keeping it simple) and it was still delicious. You can tell the pasta is fresh and made on premise. A great ratio of chicken and spinach to pasta as well.    Others got the chicken parm, pasta bolognese and marg pizza and I didn't hear one complaint, everyone was a part of the clean plate club. I'd say that's some positive reinforcement.   I'm not positive if this is normal, but I would make reservations. It was pretty packed for a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"We went for brunch really liked atmosphere and the service was great   I had the mushroom risotto as an appetizer and although it wasn't super flavorful it was still really good because we use the sauce for the bread that came extra and I also had a spinach and mushroom scramble it was really good maybe could've used some more to use the potatoes were amazing and my friend had some sort of prime rib hash which he absolutely loved  Also they let my pup come and be out on the porch"}
{"text":"We enjoyed North our first visit, so when we had family visiting, we decided to return. Either our expectations were too high, or North has gone south.   Our server was nice, but a bit on the snobbish side. When it was time to order drinks, he said he was very knowledgeable about wine, and if we told him what entrees we were thinking about ordering, he'd suggest something complimentary. Thank you very much, but you are assuming we aren't knowledgeable. Hmmm.  When we did order wine (before he took our entrée order), he acted a bit 'uppity', as if slighted that we didn't rely on his knowledge. Granted, this is just my perception and I'm willing to admit I might have read him wrong but his attitude rubbed me wrong.  The bustling kitchen produced mediocre food this visit. The place is always busy, but the mall is a goldmine, so a restaurant has to try to fail. Plus, it is very LOUD! Difficult to carry on a conversation, so if you want that, and the weather is nice, get a table outside. The décor is nice, rustic-like, but very trendy (and hipster). Additionally, the place is pretty pricey - but most Fox restaurants tend to be.  I you like pesto, order the Chicken Pesto Pasta and you'll get your pesto! Wow. Couldn't finish this green dish.  Heavy on the pesto, and very unattractive presentation. The Ricotta Gnocchi was good, but again, looked like a blob in the bowl. Spicy shrimp looked the best and of the three entrees, tasted the best (although not awesomely delicious.)   Will we go back? I don't think we'll make a special trip to eat there, but if we're at the mall, then possibly. Think we'll stick with pizza, though."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of the Fox Concepts restaurants, but his new venture at 40th St/Camelback is wonderful! It is billed as having a rustic, farmhouse atmosphere - I guess that explains the blue jeans and plaid, western-style shirts on the servers (really?? Isn't that better suited to a rustic, western atmosphere??) That said, the place does have a certain lively vibe and energetic atmosphere. They offer both inside and patio seating, although neither outside area offers a particularly nice view - either the parking lot or 40th Street and the shopping area across the street. But when the weather's nice, it's always a treat to eat outside.  We started with the bruschetta which was very, very good - a sign of more goodness to come! Our entrees included: spinach tortelloni, spicy shrimp and the pig pizza. The homemade spinach pasta was delicious and stuffed with mouth-watering cheese in a herb butter sauce. I could've done with about half the butter only because I'm not a butter fan, but must admit it was very flavorful. We were a little apprehensive that the shaved fennel on the spicy shrimp would be overpowering, but it wasn't at all. The dish was beautifully presented over homemade pasta and was very flavorful - worth ordering again! The pig pizza - so called because of its 4 pork meats - was good, too. The crust baked to perfection (no nasty burn areas).  Our service was fine - attentive, friendly and not hovering. This restaurant is in a great location and the complementary valet is a plus since the parking area is limited.  Definitely returning - sounds like a Sunday Happy Hour is in my future!"}
{"text":"This review is a prime example of how bad service can taint good food. If I could give 2.5 stars I would. I really wanted to rate this restaurant at a much higher rating.   I took my boyfriend here to celebrate his birthday a few days early. We arrived at around 7:30 and the place was packed. I should have made a reservation because we walked in and the line of people waiting at the hostess table was almost out the door. We waited to be greeted by the hostess for about 5 minutes before we could give her our names. At first, both of the hostesses were polite and told us that a table for two had about a 10-15 minute wait, so we stood in the waiting area because there were no more seats available. About 20-25 minutes go by and we still hadn't been called up. We went back to the hostess station and asked the girls what was going on. Somehow, they ended up not taking our name down, so we were never added on their wait list. When we asked them how much longer from that point, they told us 35-40 minutes, despite the fact that we had already been waiting. Their excuse was that the kitchen was working at capacity. Yeah. I understand. But if the kitchen is working at capacity, then why did she offer for us to sit at the full-service bar? Sounded like a poorly-constructed excuse devised to cover up a mistake. We sucked it up, gave them our name and made sure they had it this time, and went back to standing. Other groups and couples kept walking in and were being seated immediately. I was so frustrated that I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to leave and go somewhere else, but he said no so we just walked around the Kierland area.   After about 20 minutes, we got a text saying our table was ready. We walked back, and were seated outside. Our waitress came to take our drink order, and having had so much linger-time before we were seated, we already knew what we wanted to order, so we ordered the Pig pizza as an appetizer along with two Diet Cokes to drink. She came back immediately with two water glasses, but no Diet Coke. In the meantime, we asked for some bread and infamous sun-dried tomato butter to snack on. Five minutes had gone by and she stopped by our table with nothing, and simply told us that the bartender was backed up-- this seemed to be the excuse of the evening all night. I mean, how hard is it to really fill up a couple of soda glasses. Five minutes later, she came back with our drinks, but no bread. It took her about another 2 minutes for bread.   Right after the bread came, our pizza came. It was absolutely delicious. The meats were so flavorful, the crust was the perfect consistency and thickness, and the sauce was amazing. Even though this place isn't technically a \"pizzeria,\" I think their pizza was better than LGO's Gladiator (similar pizza with two types of sausage).  In the meantime, we ordered our main courses. I got the spaghetti, and he got the short rib gnocchi.   About 10 minutes after finishing the pizza the main courses came out. My spaghetti was really really good. The pasta, almost similar to a bucatini, was not like most traditional spaghettis. The noodles themselves were thick (larger diameter), and cooked to al-dente perfection. The pasta wasn't swimming in sauce, and similar to the pizza sauce, was very nicely flavored. My boyfriends gnocchi on the other hand was a complete disaster. I seriously cannot explain how unappetizing it was. The short ribs were apparently really good, but the sauce that it came in was SO bitter. I pretty much just dipped my fork in the sauce and didn't want to eat any more of it. After about 3 bites, we ended up having to send it back. We waited a bit, talked to the manager (I'm assuming), and eventually the other dish came out. It was actually pretty good. I can't remember what it was called but it had chicken, spinach, pine nuts and pasta all together. By this time (9:30 ish) the restaurant was starting to clear out. The waitress was nice enough to comp us an apple crumble dessert (that was truly delicious) because we were celebrating his birthday. We ate it, paid about $55 for the whole meal, and left 2 1/2 hours later. All together, the food was really good, but the service was really, really lackluster.   If the service was even just a little bit better, this place would have gotten four stars in my book. At this point, I'm not too sure if I'd be back or not. Maybe I'll venture out on a day that seems to be less crowded, where all the staff can keep up with demands."}
{"text":"The salad that I ordered was way to salty. The Resoto mushroom was very salty as well. For the sorbet, I thought that the waiter could of explained how big the scoops were, all she did was make a face. That doesn't give me any information. The sangria that I ordered was not good, I think it should be a little sweeter. It was to sour."}
{"text":"The problem was the time we had to wait for EVERYTHING. We were only a party of two and I feel that was the problem. I was celebrating an advancement in my job field and chose this restaurant as the place to enjoy this exciting time and I feel it was a mistake. I asked for a soda before my meal came and they tried to bring it to me 30min later once I got dessert menus. I decided we didn't want dessert here and left. The food was OK and was enjoyable but everything else killed it for me. Even paying the bill once the check was brought took around 30+min. I really feel the problem was my party size again, as I looked around I noticed the owner or manager walking to every table that was 4+ in party size but not us. And they ensured the larger tables were accommodated which makes sense of course but return business is crucial, and I don't see myself returning at this point."}
{"text":"Everything about North is wonderful, except...after mentioning to the server that I loved the olives, I asked about buying some to take home. He said he would put some in a to-go  container.  I was charged $5.00. Not too bad until I saw only 20 olives in a medium sized container!"}
{"text":"How do you fail with dessert?  And with chocolate for that matter.  This place probably doesn't even make their own desserts.  When the server started by telling us about the fish special I decided that I would try that.  Of course they were 'out of it'.  So i opted for the tuna.  I figured ordered seared rare I'd be safe.  How bad could it be right?  Well, the tuna was ok (not the freshest) but the tapenade with it was just off.  Too overpowering It didnt go well with the tuna. Other dishes we tried were the campanelle which was better but nothing special that a decent home cook couldn't make.  The remodel was nice inside but wasn't a fan of the outside patio seating.  It was awkward and not comfortable.  I did like the addition of the community bar tables as the bar area is pretty small.  But this place will continue to be busy as it looks nice and it's in a great location."}
{"text":"Tip - You have to utilize their \"complimentary valet.\" There is no way around it, the restaurant is located in an area with NO street parking within walking distance and the plaza across the street is off limits to NoRTH patrons.  Now onto the review: NoRTH is yet another great Fox Concepts restaurant to take a date, with just the right amount of mood lighting. I happen to enjoy looking at my boyfriend ;) so I wouldn't care if the room was bright as day, but you know how some fancy restaurants are just SOO dark that the song \"better with the lights off\" comes to mind? This is definitely not that, I don't like those restaurants haha.  ANYWAY, the decor is cute, decked out with a modern farmhouse feel and the plaid-shirt suited up service is IMPECCABLE. The food is pretty good too :)  Here's what we ordered:  $11 - Cheese & Bread platter: Melted Italian cheese with tomato jam + toasted Sourdough bread with olive oil -- this was pretty good, especially with the tomato and fruit jam in the middle of the cheese to spread onto the perfectly toasted bread. **NOTE: THIS IS A LARGE & FILLING APPETIZER   $17 - Rock Shrimp Pasta: VERY DELICIOUS! The noodles are playfully shaped and the sauce is a tomato base with a little citrus hint and some chili flakes. That's my personal description of it, but the menu description sounds way better - that's why I ordered it, and when I did, the waitress confirmed that it was her favorite pasta dish on the menu.  $15 - House Special Pizza - Fresh mozzarella, some type of Italian sausage (but it was very thinly cut, almost like prosciutto) and tomato sauce. This was okay in my book. Nonetheless, nice serving size and good taste - definitely enough for one person."}
{"text":"I came here for homecoming dinner. The atmosphere was great with perfect lighting. My date and I had the roasted salmon. We both loved it. I am looking forward to the next time I can eat here. It is also great for groups since we had a group of eight and they facilitated us excellently with the seating arrangements as well as splitting the bill."}
{"text":"I was excited for this restaurant as the same Fox concept restaurant is amazing in Phoenix and Austin. The food is good. The drinks are creative and there is a good variety of options.  Solid happy hour menu as well. They are lacking the friendly and timely staff for a restaurant like this that I hope improves over time as it is relatively new spot.  The patio is a good size and covered for those rainy Vegas nights."}
{"text":"It's been years since we have been here, what the heck have we been thinking? We had the short rib pasta on suggestion of our server Alyssa, and it was phenomenal! The food was spot on, but the 5 star review is primarily for Alyssa our server who was fantastic! Promote her and keep her in the Fox family Sam."}
{"text":"Our new favorite Italian food restaurant to come to..... we loved the ambience, the food,,,,,,, the service!!!   Chelsey was our server, and she was great!  Her attention to detail, prompt service and genuine concern in meeting our diet needs was much appreciated....  ( We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite local Italian restaurant. My Husband and I ordered 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 2 kids meals and all were amazing. We went back the very next day for more."}
{"text":"This place felt trendy if not gimmicky.  First the pluses:  The interior is pleasing to the eye:  rustic, spacious, and comfortable. Food is generally tastier than the other concepts in my opinion Servers are friendly Valet parking  Now the negatives: Food was 'meh' Awkward patio seating with uncomfortable chairs sitting on dirt Slow service Over-priced: especially for a kids grilled cheese plate that didn't even taste good Don't come hungry:  gnocchi was ok but was served as a diet portion Valet parking   I don't get this place but then again it's a Fox-owned business catering to the masses looking to make the big bucks."}
{"text":"Yay! We finally got to dine at North, I have been before in Denver, and remembered how delicious the food was. I love that we now have an option to dine somewhere new in town for Italian. North is very modern and in such an ideal location in Summerlin.  We arrived around 6:30 for dinner, we had a 25 minute wait, not too bad being that the restaurant was packed, on a Sunday, and it's Father's Day! All you have to do is leave  the hostess your name and number and they send you a text once your table is ready. So convenient!   As far as the service, it was pretty good, I do think our waitress could of came around a bit more, but it was super busy.   Now on to the food.   We ordered:  Appetizers: Cesar salad , the truffle bread, and the meatballs. The salad was great, so were the meatballs! No complaints there! I do wish they came around with fresh cheese though, getting cheese took a bit. As far as the truffle bread, definitely not worth $11, it was just crunchy toasted bread, with a little ricotta and some truffle flavors. I let the waitress know and she kindly took it off the bill.   Main: bolognese and a kids spaghetti and meatballs.   The Bolognese was extremely bland compared to everything else that we ordered! Sadly it lacked so  much flavor! This is definitely  a dish that the chef and management should fix ASAP, because it's such a staple in Italian cuisine. I'm glad we ordered others items, because that dish is potentially something that would stop us from returning.  The spaghetti and meatballs were good, great portion size for a child, even for an adult!  I do think the sauce could use a little work flavor wise, but meatballs were great, as I stated above.   My only complaint besides the issues with some of the dishes, is that all of our food came out at the same time! I don't even know how that happened!  We honestly didn't get to enjoy the appetizers first.  It was as if we ordered all of that for a main course, it was just too much at once.   I would definitely return to North, the staff was friendly, attentive, and the environment was very kid  friendly, and the  menu is priced fairly reasonable. Our waitress also left us a complementary coupon for $10 off our next visit, kudos to her! I just hope you guys fix the bolognese!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!  Excellent service too quick and fast! I'll definitely comeback and leave room for dessert."}
{"text":"My friend talked highly of this new Italian place and of course we had to try it! last Friday we went with No Reservation and Bummer we couldn't get a table :( So this time first thing i did Book A Table. booking 8pm. We were all excited. Parking was packed and from far away you could hear the noise from inside!!! The restaurant was full from entrance, Covered and heated patio, bar area and restaurant. the covered patio has a very nice fire place, love the decorative azuléjos that reminded me Portugal the  restaurant is very modern, trendy. Even I loved the decor... if you like a quiet Romantic night ... North Italian is not the right place ... it's loud loud :( We got our table quickly. I could barely hear the hostess, not sure if she even care LOL Our waitress was polite but not very sharp on her service :( It's pricy and I surely expect an excellent service what we did not received. Had to ask twice for water refill, we ordered couple appetizers and she missed to bring our bruschetta prosciutto. We enjoyed it at the same time as our meal. We ordered a round of aperitif Champagne, Apricot Lemonatta (didn't taste the apricot) Sicilian margarita. Cocktails were great. White truffle garlic bread (amazing made of fresh bread), Buratta excellent, refreshing, colorful just delicious and prosciutto bruschetta with grilled asparagus. We ordered the Strozzapreti with pine nuts, spinach, mushroom and chicken. It was delightful but next time I will order it with no chicken or have them serve it on the side. The chicken killed the dish in my opinion. The bolognese with tagliatelle pasta, I tried and like the creamy bolognese not too tomato tomato. Perfect amount of ground beef d carrot. Buratta tortellini... mushroom is my péché mignon :) it was maybe 8 tortellinis in my bowl with some sliced mushrooms and couple leaves of spinach. The dish was okay. The Bolognese was our favorite! We finished our dinner with an expresso served like in Europe :) Ask for sugar before your waitress leaves because she might not come back lol I think we were the last to leave and what a pleasant time we had when half of the restaurant left!   expérience ... so so  If you like A good Italian, i recommend ROMA deli on Spring Mountain and Jones. It's not fancy but the gastronomy is closer to Italian Grand Ma cooking ... If you want fancy go To North Italia"}
{"text":"Driving over 2300 miles in three days wears. It also wears when you have your father in the car and in order to have a conversation, you have to constantly repeat yourself because he refuses to admit he needs to get hearing aids.  Phoenix was our last stop before home: Los Angeles. I was determined to treat ourselves, since New Orleans and the McDonald's in Fort Stockton were terrible disappointments, so I picked North Italia. I'm not even one for Italian food, to be honest. Why should I pay $15 for a tomato smashed into a pasta, made of flour and eggs? I mean, seriously. Not that hard, not terribly flavorful.  Until, of course, I found this place. There was one instance where I actually liked italian food, and it was at Michael Chiarello's restaurant up in Yountville, where you have to secure a reservation two months early along with the Keller restaurant group.  Obviously, I'm going to start with a drink. I believe it was called the Julietta, a vodka, elderflower, and prosecco mixed drink that came with a pretty flower as a garnish. It became my new favorite in all the ones I've had between the pacific and east coast. Yelp told me to get the zucca chips, so I did, because I am a sheep. Baaah. That's sheep for, \"You should get it. They're flash fried zucchini chips that taste like a slightly salty cloud, and are the perfect appetizer that won't fill you up before your meal.\"  Deciding on an entree was difficult. You see, the short rib and ricotta gnocchi looked good but - let's be real here - gnocchi is one of the easiest pastas to screw up. I went to a michelin star rated restaurant and ordered gnocchi thinking, \"How could they?\" and ended up getting an answer. So my expectations were certainly low. Instead, I was given pillowy pasta, with deep hints of ricotta, and some of the most amazing braised short rib I've ever had. Anywhere else usually makes their short rib saltier than the lick the cows get as a treat - but this, oh no. This was heaven. I could taste the beef in this spectacular sauce, and it was so good and simple. Never underestimate the power of simplicity. Good lord.  My dad had the strozzapretti, which I was not expecting to be good for some reason. I don't know, I have a crazy relationship with pasta. They hand-make it all in house, and just like the gnocchi, I felt as if I could eat it forever. Chicken, mushroom, fresh al dente pasta in a parmesan cream sauce. Amazing.  For dessert we had italian donuts with a vanilla marscapone sauce, and their nutella budino. The budino, topped with toasted hazelnuts, was great, but my favorite were the donuts. Airy things, dusted with granulated sugar and swept up with sauce, were the perfect way to end the evening. I was humbled, to be honest, and actually contemplated coming back out there with my boyfriend just to take him to the restaurant. It's still up for consideration, actually.  Make a reservation well in advance, I have a feeling this place isn't going to have slow nights anytime soon."}
{"text":"Had a really great meal here!  I think the secret if you're on a date, is to split everything.  That way you get smaller portions, but can try more things.  We split the taggliatelle with braised beef, and the corvina with risotto.  Both were spot on.  The service was also very good.  Although we skipped dessert, I still think $100 tip included was a great value because of the upscale diner atmosphere, the Kierland location, and the decently priced drinks.  I can't wait to try the pizza next time!"}
{"text":"North has a lot going for it.  The food is fresh and interesting.  They are willing to customize ingredients and accommodate differing tastes.  We started with a Chef's Board which had a nice selection of nibbles.  The Calamari was tasty and crisp, but more of a beer batter than what you see in most Italian places.  The rice balls were crisp on the outside and pretty good inside, although they could of used a bit more flavor.  Pasta generally are decent sized and overall nice ingredients put together well.  Chick Parm was tender inside and crisp out.  It was served with a pasta with a white cheese sauce.  The cocktail list and wine list were more than adequate.  The problem is service.  Its just very raw.  Our bread came out without any plates.  We ordered drinks when we sat down.  They didn't come out till our starters were almost done, even though we ordered those well after the drinks. The staff was appologetic, but it still required us to raise this three times before they showed up. Our mains came out and even though we were at a table of four with room on each side the runner insisted on passing food over two of us instead of walking around the table.  Server, who was very nice, confused out credit card with another table so paying was delayed. Its not that I expect white glove service at a casual neighborhood place, but I do expect efficiency and basic understanding of things like how to serve food at the table.  I view this place as a strong four star place that get pulled down to 3/4 based on front of house."}
{"text":"I'm an Italian-American from the NJ/NY area. Sorry, North doesn't do it for me. Some of the flavor ideas/combinations to me are a little bizarre and don't work. The ricotta gnocchi with short rib and horseradish crema to me was like eating a steak sandwich, rather than a pasta dish.  I just wasn't a fan of the flavors-well, the horseradish crema-which was the ONLY flavor in the dish. And as another reviewer pointed out, the pasta did have some oil (or butter?) visibly separating, which was a little unappetizing. My husband had the \"house specialty,\" the pasta bolognese, which also wasn't so good. Limp pasta and sausage-heavy bolognese. -No depth of flavor, one note.  Sorry, fresh, delicious pasta dishes shouldn't be that hard to achieve for an Italian restaurant.  Fox Concepts' Olive and Ivy is much better!!!  It's consistently great. I also happened to have a yummy pasta dish at Fox Concepts' Arrogant Butcher - it was a sweet potato pasta dish. When combined with some of my husband's steak, that was pretty delicious. Without the meat for some savoriness, it was a bit sweet."}
{"text":"First time at North Italia. Food was excellent! For a Wednesday, it was pretty busy! The host was wonderful and even when we requested specific seating after he had given us a 30-40 minute wait, he got us those seats in less than 10 minutes. Another server was super sweet and trying to help us out as well!  Food was delicious! We started with the meatballs, then shared family style the arancini, prosciutto bruschetta, and the strozzapreti (?).   My only negative would be that service was a little slow. With that being said, a manager was great for coming around with refills, answering questions, and helping his staff. I am in the industry and understand how tough it can be when it's a crazy busy night, especially on a day that isn't usually very busy. I have to praise for the teamwork, food, and how friendly the staff was. We can't wait to go back and try all the things!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night -we were 5 people . Ordered the Arancini and meatballs -both tasty ,but small portions & served in cast iron tiny skillets ,which I didn't like to see. Ordered two pizzas-the sauce was raw & the dough was dry. Ordered two Chicken parms which were too thick & not enough sauce (asked for extra sauce which they did bring ,but the sauce was raw) also not enough cheese on the chicken Parmesan either & was served with rigatoni in a white cream sauce -that was tasty &  al Dente which was great, but small portioned . No bread on the table.  The vanilla gelato -one tiny melon ball  scoop ,it was ok ,not great . I wouldn't run back. Very noisy & not liking the too many high tables.  Reminds me of kona-more of a hang out & to be seen!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants to go to. I love my Italian food and with all of their homemade, made from scratch dishes, you can't go wrong. The pizza is to die for and I looooove the spaghetti and meatballs. Plus, the prices are pretty decent! It's also so cool that you can just see everything that's going on in the kitchen, such a cool place!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I've been going to North for years, this location and the one in Scottsdale. I really like their beet salad and spaghetti. However, the past few times we have gone to North, we have had some kind of issue. We went to the Scottsdale location recently and our food didn't taste good, it's hard to explain, but something was just off about both of our dishes. The past 3 times we have gone to the Arcadia location something has gone wrong. One time my boyfriend found metal in his pasta, apparently they use it to make the pasta. But that's scary. They apologized and replaced it, but still. Then, 2 other recent times, one being last night, there was meat in my vegetarian dish. I understand cross contamination can happen, but it seems like it's happening quite frequently lately. I was to keep going here, but I have obvious concerns and reservations."}
{"text":"Well.... I really wanted to like this place. I know it's Hot & New.   The portion sizes were very small for the price and our waiter never offered and never brought any bread to the table. Not sure when we will be back. Maybe for happy hour."}
{"text":"Yes! The 5 stars speaks for itself. Trust those who review it as such. Kale-potato-sausage soup-amazing! Crispy calamari with arugula - spectacular! Chicken pesto pasta - to order again and AGAIN! If you have been hearing the buzz, it's worth it! We drove here across town for my birthday celebration and already planning our next visit! Great ambience, open kitchen concept, and a much needed new Italian restaurant. Save room for dessert. appetito osseo!"}
{"text":"Took my date here for a valentines dinner and wow is all I gotta say we had a 4 course meal and dessert for a awesome price and felt like we were on top of the world awesome staff too really attentive"}
{"text":"Keeps getting better and better. Love the artichokes, salmon, and few other plates.  Good staff, good atmosphere   Only thing one needs to learn to order slow. Food flys out of the kitchen and you don't get through your appetizer and the main meal shows up. Manager is cool and said she's working on the folks in the back, think she still has to crack that whip better.   Lol."}
{"text":"I went here with some friends a few nights ago and it was amazing!! The atmosphere is great, the food is even better. We sat out in the patio area but there were plenty of heaters and it was closed off from the outside so we were nice and warm. Our waitress, Alexia, was very attentive and suggested a great bottle of wine. The prosciutto bruschetta and the tagliatelle bolognese were amazing. My friend got the chicken parm and I tasted it- I'll be back for that too!! Good food, good service, convenient location. I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The first time I went I had the short ribs which I will give 2 out of 5. I went back yesterday to celebrate a friends brirthday, and the staff were very friendly and professional but the food was a different story. I figured you can't go wrong with a pizza and ordered the Funghi pizza and oh boy was I wrong. The pizza was extremely salty and had too much oil. They offered to remake it with less salt and when it came out it was the same. Very disappointed by the simple fact they  can't make a simple pizza."}
{"text":"Seriously the best pasta I've ever had in my life. Hands down the most fresh ingredients yet the best blends of seasonings that they have created to each and every single dish! The best recipes I swear! Every single pasta I've had is just mind blowing how great and packed of wonderful flavors put into one plate are. Never ever disappoints at all . It's always packed full and very busy but the wait is so worth it. It's not just because it's new that I love it , its really mainly how freshly things are made here you can tell just in the taste. The place inside is just decorated beautifully and the tables are not crammed by one another. Great staff everyone's very nice and friendly from the second you step in and just full of smiles. Thank you for the great food north!"}
{"text":"Great dinner tonight. Meals were fresh hot and tasty. Excellent service..recommend the mussels ...super good. We've visited a few times in the past and it seems to get better each time. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came here on a date night with my oh so pretty wife. We were early and happy hour was hoping whixh was nice as we had some of the items we wanted for half price whixh was nice.   Happy hour items.  Zucca chips crispy fried and delicious.  Daily pizza which was eggplant parm. Goods but I should ahve tried the pig version which is all meat.   Grilled cauliflower parma sauce with sunny side up egg making the most wonderful.sauce over the grilled cauliflower. Great.   Driver scallops: my wife had this. Awesome.  The risotto what corn flavored and soooooooooo good.   Buccattini carbonara which is jot on the menu but I was told by a friend that works here that they will make just about anything you want just just have to ask your server to ask if they can make what you want. Was craving carbonara and did not see it on the menu. I asked my server and she checked and then I selected my pasta and bam they made it for me and WOW it as creamy panchettie cheesie  goodness. So amazingly good.  For desert we had the tiramsu which was so delicious I.fought my wife for the last bite.   Service was Spectacular thanks Halley! 5/5. Food: 5/5. Overall 5/5. We can't wait to come back and try their salads and some of the other mains and pastas."}
{"text":"North Italia in Scottsdale is a find. Especially on Sunday when it's Happy Hour all day.  This gem is in the Kierland Commons Center in Scottsdale and part of a chain of innovative restaurants that make up Fox Restaurant Concepts around the country.  The half price wine list is a deal. The food is well seasoned without being overly salted and the portions are more then generous.    We shared a nice Caesar Salad and the Rustic style Tomato Soup was declared by my ever love'n to be second only to Bistro Jeanty's incredible preparation. That is saying a lot.  For me it was to heavy, but he loved it so like art is in the eye of the beholder so is food in the mouth of the gourmet.   Himself had chicken Parm. a portion big enough for two on a bed of lovely ziti.  The pasta is made on site daily.  I had the mussels (also big enough for two) steamed in a lovely broth seasoned with spicy dry Italian sausage and lots of garlic.  A side of toasted garlicky herbaceous Parmesan bread accompanied the mussels. Our big regret, leaving town and not being able to take home the remains of the feast.  We noticed that just about everyone who dined there walked out with take home boxes.  The one miss was the zucchini chips. A bit to oily and somewhat limp so not the best I have had.   The Eden Valley Chard was just fine and our waitperson Jordon was excellent.  I would recommend if you want to make a date at North in Scottsdale make a reservations and asking for her station."}
{"text":"We've been here twice, first we tried an array of appetizers: White Truffle Bread with house-made ricotta (delish) Arancini, we much prefer the ones from Settebello at Village Square.  Crispy Calamari is good, you need to eat it before it cools so it stays crunchy! Our second visit we tried the house special Bolognese and the Chicken Pesto. The Chicken Pesto was the winner hands down! Incredible, but be forewarned...it is a VERY rich dish. We promised to split the plate next time. Great atmosphere, wonderful service and a nice array of good quality food. You can't lose !"}
{"text":"What a treat.   This was a tasty meal I had chicken pesto and with the first bit realized it was going to be good.  The place was full. A little wait but had some extra bread while waiting.   The meal was filling and delicious with fresh being how I would describe it.  I would go back and my cousin had been before and obviously others knew about it by word of mouth.   Try it."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner. Sat at bar, John Luke was the best. Zucchini fries, the best. Also had the calamari and cauliflower apps. Split short ribs dinner with my boyfriend. That dish over the polenta was so delicious. Can't wait to return to Scottsdale to return."}
{"text":"Excellent food and a great Happy Hour at NoRTH. I've tried a couple of Sam Fox restaurants with mixed reviews, Olive & Ivy being the only one I return to.  Their lunch is also really good and the Italian Farm salad is really great. Their wine list is so-so, but the pizza looks excellent.   Next trip, I'll try this and the zucca chips!"}
{"text":"My brother recommended this place based on his experience with the Denver location.  We got there at happy hour.  The wine selection was good, the pizzas were excellent, as were the pastas.  The waiter was also highly experienced, helpful and friendly.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I just went here today for lunch after find them on the Whistl app for iPhone. Let me start off by saying, the service was outstanding. Everyone from the hostess to the manager was just delightful.   Their happy hour menu was excellent and very reasonably priced. I started off with the spicy nuts ($2). They appeared to be light caramelized in sugar and cajun spices. It was a perfect blend of sweet and spicy. Next I got the chef's choice pizza. A different pizza everyday! It was definitely big enough to split with someone after an appetizer or happy hour item. It had roasted peppers, pepperoni, oregano and tons of fresh basil on top (my favorite!). For $8 it was a solid bargain. I will definitely coming back to try their other daily pizzas! I would also recommend the bucatini and meatballs $(5) , as well as the zucca chips ($2). I've had the zucca chips and they are a great alternative to potato chips, very flavorful. I saw someone eating the bucatini and meatballs and it looked absolutely delicious.  I cannot recommend this place enough. It's a great place to take a date, the portions are all very generous. An overall great atmosphere made this an even more wonderful place to dine. Cannot wait to go back soon! If you're looking for more great deals in the area, definitely download the Whistl app for iPhone! It's free, no advertisements, and I have not been disappointed with any of the restaurants on there.  Happy eats everyone!"}
{"text":"First time i went it was so so. Second time was better. Best to make a reservation on open table. It was way better experience when we made a reservation. I asked to be close to the tv cuz the playoffs were on and they did accommodate me"}
{"text":"Having enjoyed the North in Kierland Commons, this location had much to live up to. To start, we ordered the highly addicting zucca chips and two glasses of white wine. We were sold on trying the handmade pasta so I got the spicy shrimp and my girlfriend tried the lasagna. The shrimp had a nice kick and I really enjoyed the pasta texture and sauce. You can tell they put an emphasis on quality ingredients. For dessert, we had the sugary doughnuts served on a custard sauce which were ok, though not quite as good as I remembered. The restaurant is open and lively, much like many of the other Sam Fox concepts. For a good meal and a terrific ambiance, you can't go wrong with checking out this \"Italian Farmhouse.\"  FYI - Come prepared to valet your car because the parking lot is packed on a busy night."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here for the first time a few weeks ago and we really enjoyed ourselves. The pizza was delicious and the kale salad was out of this word. Our server was very helpful and was quick to take care of our orders and make sure our drinks stayed fresh.   The atmosphere is nice here as well, very spacey and thanks to the abundance of windows very well lit. We got the pizza and salad special for $20 and that was more than enough for my wife and I. Then the kids split a \"kids\" sized pepperoni pizza, which again was more than enough.   I would certainly recommend this place for a nice pizza and even a salad."}
{"text":"We planned a dinner meeting here for our work guests who came in from out of town. The atmosphere here is awesome. Our server was fantastic and really great at offering . The food was delightful and the drinks were superb. We all really enjoyed this place and left really happy. I can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Great food and selection of wine. Someone has done their research and has worked many years in the industry to put this high dollar project together. The glitziest and most polished Italian restaurant that I've recently been to, which will require a follow up visit to see if it's all formulaic or if there is some spontaneity and originality to their menu.  Wish I could have parked my own car, they parked it fifteen feet away and didn't want to retrieve it at the end of my visit bc it was fifteen feet away and not sure the valet trusted himself. Fair enough."}
{"text":"This was a great find, loved the ambiance and decor. The calamari and rosemary chicken were fantastic. My date ordered the shrimp pasta, which had great flavor however the shrimp were a bit overcooked. Wine and cocktails are a bit pricey. All in all I enjoyed the place and will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night with friends for another fantastic meal. The food is always great and I love the atmosphere. We had an especially good time last night due to our server Gianna. She was sweet, attentive and funny. Request her if you go there, she made our night!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything we ordered was good. Appetizer plate had fresh meat, cheese and nuts. So good. Also ordered a pizza and some pasta dish.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"Hello hot bartender Ron. Mmmm. I love the vibe in North, and how unique of a restaurant it is. Kinda barn looking on the outside, with servers all dressed in button up plaid shirts. So cute.  An interesting cocktail menu and small starters of crispy chickpeas and fruity olives got me going. I wish they had more vegetarian/cheese free items on the menu.... The pizza my friend ordered was good, at least the portion of crust I tried anyway. Nice and chewy and not burnt. Dessert of fall apple crumble was insanely good but also insanely small of a portion   : / coulda eaten buckets of it. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"We found the main area to be a bit loud for our taste and happily took a table outside even though it was quite warm.  We have a member of our family with sensory issues and the noise level was anxiety producing inside, but outside worked perfect for us!  The pizza margherite and spicy salami pizza were perfect.  Everything was timed very well, the food was fresh and very hot, service was spot on.  We will be back!  Great deal on Sunday with $8 pizza and $4 house wines."}
{"text":"Having arrived as a member of a luncheon group, we were seated on the enclosed patio with heating lamps that kept our area of the spacious room at a comfortable temperature, even though our organizer made reservations for several tables in the main dining room. The calamari was tender and interesting in a lemon vinaigrette. Our waiter Leonard was cheerful and provided excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Went with 2 colleagues from work. We waited 30 minutes for a table even though there was ample seating available I was craving white sangria which they didn't have, so I ordered the tea which was passion fruit and delicious.   Appetizers:  The charcuterie board was insane and was a smorgasbord of treats. It had: Perfect bread, a soft and hard cheese, prosciutto, olives, apricots, almonds, asparagus and eggplant purée.  The meatballs were delicious too! The sauce was perfect!   I loved the salad I had which was the farm salad and had Italian lunch meats and was perfectly dressed.  The colleagues I was doing with both got the chicken Parm and they loved it. The pasta it came with had some type of truffle oil and smelled delicious.   The service was fantastic also!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. The grilled chicken sanwich was great, the grilled vegtebles sandwich was not. Tasty but very oily... The place looks great and the service was fantastic. Sam Fox knows how to create them :)"}
{"text":"I received a very nice message from the manager offering to make it up to us. This is the type of follow up that can win you a loyal customer. I really appreciate this gesture and will look forward to giving it another try in the near future. More to come."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. The weekend breakfast is awesome (short rib hash and their French toast) are some of our favorites. It's a pleasant environment, and we truly enjoy coming here. The spaghetti and Margarita pizza are lunch favorites, you can truly taste the fresh ingredients. Thank you to the staff who is always gracious :)"}
{"text":"I was reluctant to go to the Kierland area this past weekend because I knew my wallet would take a beating. But my wife had a gift certificate and wanted to explore the Kierland area shops and restaurants.  We made reservations for 5:30 on the patio. We waited for about 5 minutes for our table to be cleaned and were escorted to our table on the patio. Talk about living large, a patio overlooking the shops and the courtyard which was accented with a bunch of palm trees on a beautiful 80 degree day. The ambiance alone rates an extra star.  We started off with the Trio for $9, which is 4 pieces of bread (which was refilled) and with generous amounts of Hummus, an Olive spread, and Goat Cheese. All spreads were delicious. My favorite was the Goat Cheese, WOW! My first time to eat Goat Cheese and I am definitely hooked.  We lucked out an had a great server, I believe her name was Bree. Kudos Bree! Bree helped us with the menu items.  My son had the Chicken Parmasean and didn't share any with me. So I'm thinking that was really good and I should order some next time. My wife went out of her comfort zone and ordered the Buccatini which is Short Ribs and Spaghetti, WIN! I ordered the Flank Steak which was topped with fresh Arugula greens. The steak was fabulous, they serve you what seems to be two steaks that are cut in strips. Plenty of food, I had a hard time finishing off the steak since it was so much.   We then relaxed and had a great post meal family conversation. All and all, a very enjoyable evening out for $70 (no alcohol) before tip and gift card."}
{"text":"Food is good but never hot when brought out to the patio.  They need to keep it covered before serving.  It's the same every time we dine there."}
{"text":"I love Italian style food. This place completely satisfies me. For anyone to give less than a 5 star review must be an anomaly. Our first visit was a total joy and we'll be returning soon.   Started out with the Chef's board...a delightful assortment of cheese, meat, veggies, bread and more and a great way to begin the meal. The short rib radiatori deserves its highly reviewed reputation...really good, and the burrata tortellini is equally delicious.   Decor is modern and open but the large crowd made it a little on the loud side. Service was friendly and prompt considering that it was very busy.   Prices are fair considering the quality of the food and uniqueness of the menu.   As I've told a number of people...you gotta try this place."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place inside to check it out try the chef appetizer board it is so good and fresh"}
{"text":"Came here because I had gone to the other North (in Kierland) just a few days prior and had such a good meal that I had to return.  The mushroom pizza (\"funghi\" to be exact) which was AH-mazing at the other location, but here it was a little dry... not as much cheesy mushroom-y goodness.  Was a little disappointed needless to say since I had been craving that pizza from the moment I licked the plate clean at Kierland.   The service was terrific though, we sat at the bar (wish I remembered the bartender's name). Drinks were good & strong and the ambiance was great, so I would still come to this one if in the area, but I'll make the extra drive to the more \"north\" North for my funghi fix."}
{"text":"Gnocchi is the bomb. I always get the chicken sandwich for lunch. The apricot sauce just makes the sandwich. Order with the potatoes. The salads are amazing and the pizza is fantastic. I honestly have yet to try something there I do not like. Everything is fresh from homemade pasta to the meats on your Italian sandwich. Love this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and I find myself craving North! Very trendy and well designed restaurant- the valet seems a bit over the top. However the food is absolutely delicious. Best spaghetti and meatballs I've ever had (homemade pasta). The meatball sub with side of potatoes is fantastic. The chef's board are just right as an appetizer for the table with many options as well as the light desserts to top everything off. YUM!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to have Sunday brunch at this place. Let me just start by saying it was excellent! I wish I could rate higher then a five . My husband had I the short rib hash and I had the nonna casserole. Which was so delicious and had to taste my husbands short rib hash which was also delicious. And the lemon donuts so good. If you want a great place to have brunch go there you will not be disappointed. If you are a foodie good there. I will go back to try something else. Service was also very good. The food is different not your usual brunch. It was awesome. Beautiful decor very rustic and modern beautiful patio. Great restaurant."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to hit up North in Arcadia last night. Nice addition to the area, fits right in with all of the other great places in the neighborhood. Met some other couples for drinks and dinner. Like most people who grew up here, obv not a fan of mandatory valet but oh well. Walking in, you're definitely struck by the amazing decor and it's certainly the highlight of this location. Big, open spaces, beautiful Italian farmhouse converted to a restaurant. Really stunning.  Sat at the bar for a while, it was packed and service was not as prompt as I'd like which was kind of a running theme for the rest of the night. Not a huge fan of the plaid shirts worn by the servers. They didn't really stand out and were hard to distinguish from the patrons sometimes. Finally, when we were moved to our table we just carried our drinks and a bottle of wine over, which I always think is funny when patrons are walking around a restaurant bottle of wine in hand...  Service was ok not great. 4 of the 5 couples in our group had never been to North but we never were given a run down of the restaurant or what is good or any of the normal stuff most servers give you when they first greet you. Never once did our server fill our wine glasses, and they tried to take my wife's dinner plate away before she was finished, and they actually did take mine away without even asking and I wasn't finished.   Food was very good as you'd expect from a Fox restaurant. Had the Seasonal Vegetable Salad w/ chicken and it was great. Love the farro in it. Also had the prosciutto wrapped chicken, was a little disappointed in it. It was good, but I just expected something amazing I guess and it just seemed pretty standard. I didn't at all like the bed of spinach it was served on. It comes served in a large bowl and the bottom of the bowl was filled with the juice from the chicken and the spinach was just kind of wet and soggy. Seemed like a sloppy presentation.  Definitely would go back. I'm a huge sucker for beautiful spaces and this is one of my favorites in the valley. Everything else was just decent, but that isn't terrible so I'm happy for another good restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go, mostly for the custard desert that they offer. The dishes are very inspirational, you can tell there is a chef that is creating the combination of ingredients that inspires one to go home and attempt to be creative/artistic. The Salmon is very good with a side of squash. This dish is repeated often and we are always tempted to try a new dish or a special. The service is very professional and on top of our needs.   Just be warned, you will think you are in Scottsdale with the trendy atmosphere and the high end dishes, the bill will remind you that you are not in Scottsdale though."}
{"text":"We wanted to see what the buzz was about. It always appears to be hopping even mid week. Had the arroncini delicious, tried the meatballs very good. I suggest save room for dessert the salted Carmel is awesome !  The restaurant is high energy fills up fast great for gatherings. They have patio dining also."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this restaurant! An easy 5 stars for being able to maintain a kitchen producing house made pasta and delicious pizza in a high-traffic location in Summerlin. I expect their quality as exclusive to much smaller joints, so definitely give North Italia a try if you're craving Italian! The service was also great, with genuinely kind and attentive staff. Loved the funghi pie and even recommend the basic, but well-done and nostalgic spaghetti and meatballs. Zucca chips are a must have starter too. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place 5 stars but I will explain why I can't at the end of this review. I first tried this place in Austin, TX. I had never had fresh in house made pasta. It is truly life changing!!! Ok, well not life changing but definitely changed my ability to have pasta any other way. It even has convinced me to buy a fresh pasta maker and get my pasta making on! When I found out it was going to open locally in Las Vegas in December I made it a point to go the day after it opened, 12/13/17.  We went for a friends birthday. I made reservations and made sure to tell the hostess. When we entered the restaurant they asked who's birthday it was and said happy birthday to my friend. Figured we were good to go with some kind of dessert at the end. Dinner was fantastic. We were all impressed, even my friends father who said \"he is not a pasta fan\". My only reason for deducting a star is that the birthday somehow got lost in the transfer from hostess to server. She did not acknowledge it at all. Those little things mean something and are a huge miss when you make it a point to take someone out on their birthday, especially when you've raved about it. Maybe it was overlooked because I didn't bring in any obnoxious balloons or gift bags. It took me a few months to get time to write this review and in reading some reviews it seems the majority that aren't perfect are coming back more on staff and customer service than the food. It's sad because it really beats out places like Nora's that does not do fresh pasta but bad service will deter anyone even from the best food. Hope they get that together! Other than that, recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm Italian. My wife is allergic to garlic. This Italian never gets out to Italian restaurants. But, my wife wanted to try this place after seeing pictures online. They customized her dishes to have zero garlic, so a big thank you to them!  Our waitress was also excellent and personable. A big recommend."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! Loved everything we ordered. The meatballs were delicious. Or server, Bill, was awesome. Super friendly and accommodating. Try the chicken parm and chicken noodle soup. All pastas are made in house. Would love one of these restaurants on the east coast."}
{"text":"Celebrated my wife's 50th for late lunch early dinner today. We were first time visitor because of recommendation from friends. All I can say is WOW! Great wine superb food and wait staff! Prices were also very reasonable! We will be back many times!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner here last night with my husband. I liked the atmosphere and everyone who worked there was nice. We tried the zucca chips which are good but I probably won't get them next time. We split a Caesar salad to start. It was good, but seemed a little small for the price and could have used more croutons. If you don't care for fish you might not like it because we could taste anchovies in the dressing (which is supposed to be there).   My husband got the squid ink pasta. He said it was ok but he wouldn't get it again. He thought it was very heavy on the pepper and too spicy as a result. My dinner was the star of the show! I got the short rib radiatori and it was out of this world amazing!!! I don't think I would have tried it but I saw a couple of yelp reviews that recommended it, so I gave it a try and it did not disappoint! It's in this delicious, creamy sauce with bread crumbs on top to add a little crunch, but the short rib just falls apart and is so melt in your mouth amazing! I'm craving it already today. I will be back for that. I only wish we had bread to go with it. I'd also like to try a desert because they had some delicious sounding options but we didn't really have time for it.   Overall, a solid choice. Try the SHORT RIB RADIATORI!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night.  We had a reservation and was seated immediately.  The ambiance was great and even though the room was big and it was noisy it wan't an unbearable level.  Service was also attentive.  I had the artichoke which was good but not the best I've had.   My husband had spaghetti and meatballs and he said the same thing.  Some other tables nearby had the Chef's Board which looked really delicious and I would try that next time."}
{"text":"I will keep it simple...Fantastic place to eat!  Great atmosphere and the Bolognese was amazing."}
{"text":"NoRTH now has HAPPY HOUR from 3:00-6:30pm Monday through Saturday! The hubs and I went there last week and what a wonderful time it was!   We enjoyed: Zucca Chips, Crisp Calamari with Baby Arugula and Grilled Lemons as well as the Trio of Spreads: Eggplant, Hummus, Pesto Goat Cheese & Garlic Bread....this was all to START! :)   Our meal consisted of the Angus Burger, Smoked Provolone, Crispy Pancetta,Tomato Tapenade (for the hubs) I had a delicious, albeit HUGE Grilled Chicken Sandwich with Crescenza Cheese, Tomato, Avocado. I also enjoyed two Terzo's of the 08 Pinot Grigio IGT - Livio Felluga \"Esperto\", Italy. Absolutely light and refreshing!   We were out the door for $46.00! And better yet--we decided that we ordered WAY more food than necessary so our next trip there we will surely spend even less.   If you haven't been to NoRTH yet---start with the Happy Hour! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"\"A wonderful evening and dining experience!\"  We were greeted warmly by the Assistant GM Jonas and offered a table on the patio, but opted for inside due to the Heat in July.  Misters were nice on the patio, but still wanted a cooler setting.  We sat in a wonderful high top table directly facing the kitchen and were able to watch all the amazing chefs create delicious looking dishes.  BTW.....try one of the meat or cheese boards.  :).  Our Server Kyle did an amazing job!  We started off with the steamed mussels in a savory wine and garlic broth with small amounts of Italian spicy meats.  Delicious fresh mussels served with great toasted dipping bread!  If you like mussels, you will love this dish.   My girl had never been to North and I forgot to order the Zucs!  A must have at North......\"just order them\".... You will Love them!  We then ordered the spicy shrimp pasta dish and shared it and it was delicious.  Great homemade pasta, savory shrimp with a slight kick, but not to spicy and great secret flavors.  (Leaks were used to make the sauce).  We also forgot to to order a salad prior to our pasta and were encouraged to try the seasonal veggie salad. Next time for sure. ( we paired our meal with a wonderful bottle of a Red Blend..\"Dreaming Tree\"...moderately priced and very nice....not to big and dry, just nice and only $26 as I recall.   We ended our great meal with an Epic chocolate tort/moose with a delicious rich nuttela sauce on it.  Overall...great food, good pricing, fantastic service and a fun place.  The only reason not 5 stars was its a bit noisy, but you quickly get acclimated to it!  Thanks Jonas and Kyle....you both did great!  We will be back....."}
{"text":"First visit, hectic scene, but carry out. Interesting conversations overheard watching crazy crowd and had time to make a run after ordering. I hope you're an honest patron, I am. I was almost able to leave without paying for my order. I specifically came in, despite living 5 min. from the restaurant, to ensure good service and quality. The lot traffic will be a test for non-neighborhood & return guests.  I placed my order and was assured, \"bring it to you when it's ready\".  Amazing, however, I almost left without paying."}
{"text":"Pastas are incredibly fresh and tasty. The kale salad and salmon were excellent. It gets loud in there.  Great staff."}
{"text":"This is my favorite of the Sam Fax concepts.  North has been revamped and is now more rustic.  It's a huge, huge improvement over the old North.  I have been to the Kierland, 40th Street and Tucson locations.    The Good:  We love the location on 40th Street.  We usually go on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch.  We like to sit at the bar and the bar tenders are all super friendly.  We also like the wine special, don't know what that says about us.  There are so many good choices on the menu.  The pasta is all handmade.  The pizza's are excellent and they have a good selection of wines.  The Tucson location is beautiful and there is a great view from the patio.  The Bad:  For some reason some of my favorite items from the menu are not available at the Kierland location.  Also, the lasagne is not very good, I would avoid it."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here since they opened and was able to visit, twice, within 2 weeks. The first visit was for dinner with a group of 5 and the second visit was for Sunday brunch. It seems like no matter what time of day, North Italia is always packed.  I love the open seating area and how the bar area opens to the patio. Bathrooms are well lit and clean. Tons of seating on the patio with heaters. The host never wrote down our name but was able to remember who was next and sat us within a reasonable amount of time... although they could have given us a quote. The host just said we'll seat you soon.   I wasn't offered bread my first visit but the second visit, the server did offer. It comes with butter and a side of olive oil and balsamic. What I did not like was that there weren't any plates given for us to eat the bread on. Not a big deal since we just dug right in.   The common theme here seems to be a long wait for food.... no matter how big or small your group or what you order. The most recent visit, my bf and I ordered a short rib hash and short rib pasta. It took 40 minutes for the food to come out and our server apologized multiple times. When the food came out... it was very disappointing.  4/5 short rib hash ($14) if I can remember correctly, it had a few pieces of arugula, some red peppers, 3 pieces of short rib & was seasoned very well. A little on the spicy side. The bf thought it had some chorizo in it but it didn't. The grilled bread that came with the dish was burnt so I didn't try eating it but it looked good (minus being burnt). It had grated Parmesan on top. The short rib was super soft and complimented the mashed potatoes well. The hash wasn't like a traditional hash browns, the potatoes were probably boiled, mashed a bit and then fried.   2/5: short rib pasta ($20)- my bf ordered this and we should have ordered an appetizer and a salad along with it. Not sure if they give out smaller portions during lunch vs dinner or what but it was comparable to a kids portion of pasta at other restaurants. He had 5 pieces of short rib in his pasta which I thought was a decent amount. It was garnished with arugula and shaved Parmesan. I wish our server had told us that the portion size of this dish is on the small side. Their pastas are made fresh daily so it's good! A bit chewy but not over cooked. And the sauce reminded me of an Alfredo sauce but not too creamy.  The first time I came here, my friend ordered the squid ink pasta. He's not allergic to tomatoes but had a strong dislike for it... he had one bite and decided to not eat it because it came with a tomato/wine sauce (per our server). We set it aside and our server did not offer to bring another menu or switch out his dish until after everyone was done eating! I however, did like the squid ink pasta. I love their pastas here even though serving size could be worked on.   Another friend ordered their scallops and I thought the serving size was spot on, but it was too salty for the table to enjoy.   North Italia is a good date spot, and has a really good happy hour. Pizza OR cheese board AND a bottle of wine for only $20?! Count me in for the happy hour but if I had to pay full price for their dishes... I think I'll pass."}
{"text":"Went here on Friday and were very pleased!  We had a reservation so we were sat right away. The waitress was very welcoming and pleasant. She gave us great food recommendations.   We started with some drinks which were cheap and excellent. I liked the sangria a lot!   Then they brought as warm bread which was a great starter. We also ordered the meatballs which were amazing!!! Some of the best I have ever had. They were full of flavor and the sauce was delicious!!  For meals we got the daily pizza which was very good. Unique and tasty. My boyfriend got the chicken Parmesan. It was perfect because it filled him up. It was great!  The ambiance is nice. A little dark and beautiful lighting. My only complaint is that the tables are all so close together since it is a small restaurant. So it gets very noisy.   Otherwise, we had a great time. Loved the food and will be back again!!"}
{"text":"There was mold in my drink (not sure if from the bottom of the ice bucket or if from the green tea container).   I asked the waiter for a straw and he didn't bring one for over 10 minutes, this gave me plenty of time to just sit and look at my tea when I noticed that there was mold in it. Although, I had already taken a couple of sips, ugh. I pointed it out to another waiter (I didn't know where ours had gone as I hadn't seen him for a while) who was very nice and apologetic and took it away. Our waiter came over about 5 minutes later and was oddly defensive about it. \"I just want to make sure that YOU know it was nothing dangerous\". Um, okay?  Later, he acted like king of the world for being so kind as to remove the tea from the bill. Haughtily proclaiming \"Oh, by the way, don't you worry about paying for that tea, I took that off the bill for you!\" OH MY GOODNESS! Thank you kind sir for not making me pay for the nausea you gave me."}
{"text":"This place needs some work but has potential.  The bottle of White wine they served us was warm.  The place is noisy and loud- tough for dinner conversations.  You have to beg for bread, and then beg for plates to put it on.  Appetizers- none of the 4 we ordered were good.  2 of us liked our entrees, 2 of us hated them.  They forgot it was a birthday celebration so we left without dessert."}
{"text":"A group of 45 of us had dinner at North Italia this evening.  Thus I fully understand that food is not always at it's best when serving a large group.  Please bear this in mind when reading my comments.  Dinner began with fried zucchini chips, bruschetta/antipasto platters.  These appetizers were very good.  All enjoyed the fresh chips and the bowls were rapidly emptied.  Clearly the appetizers were a home run with our group.  Next came a mundane Caesar salad.  It needed more dressing, more cheese, croutons that did not taste like they came prefab in a bag.  Sad to say the Caesar salad I buy at home as a kit from Gelson's tastes better than the one I had this evening.  My pasta Bolognese was 3 star.  It was good and hit the spot.  If it had a tad more cheese and more seasoning it would be 4 star.  Dessert was a very good caramel cream mousse.  Delicious!  Others at my table had Tiramisu.  The Tiramisu had challenges as it tasted like there were Cocoa Puffs on top?  I will definitely give this establishment another try.  The service was good and the staff were attentive."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Day and it was amazing. The bruschetta and arroncini was delicious. The arrabiata was so flavorful as was the Rosemary chicken. The dessert was our favorite part of the meal. We had the salted caramel budino and tiramisu. It was all perfect! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. A friend recommended this place for lunch... So glad we went there salad and pics was delish."}
{"text":"$16 for undercooked spaghetti.  We had to ask for bread and for spoons for our meal.  There are better places with better service. The only good thing here was the Bolognese."}
{"text":"I simply can't say enough good things about this place. Hubby had been here but was new to me. Freddy was our server and his service was impeccable. He made suggestions but I love my Arnold Palmers to which he said he could provide and, even better, the lemonade was made on the premises. Ordered artichoke for app, I can't imagine any other restaurant makes this better. TO DIE FOR!!! hubby ordered calamari & caesar for lunch, was amazing. I ordered the polenta with mushrooms and spinach. OMG. I don't know what the seasoning is but it is completely addictive. The portions are perfect for those of us more concerned with quality vs quantity. You are getting a fair amount of food, but, more importantly, it is very healthy, fresh & well done. For dessert affogato, wow. I requested a dollop of creme fraiche & Freddy took care of it. We are going back soon with the kids, my son is gluten free & they do have options for that. The icing on the cake is the fun atmosphere surrounded by one of Scottsdale's finest shopping experiences."}
{"text":"North is the Martha Stewart of Italian Restaurants. It is expertly executed but it lacks an authenticity that you want in your local trattoria, an authenticity that really comes through in other local spots like Marcelinos, Veneto, Franco's or Pomo. That doesn't mean that you can't come to enjoy a good meal, a great looking setting, and a fun crowd."}
{"text":"We went about 7 and while the place wasn't full we were told a 45 minute wait becuase of lots of reservations - we had 2 in the party and ended up sitting in the bar section of the restaurant and the tables didn't fill up while we were there.  We had the zucca chips (YUM) and both had a pizza.  The pizzas were very handmade and very good, but very salty (I could tell the next morning when my fingers were swollen) - overall the food was good, the atmosphere is cool, but the whole \"wait 45 minutes\" when there are clearly many empty tables and nobody else waiting is annoying... the bartenders were cool and helpful from a waiter standpoint."}
{"text":"Very lovely place! Food was great! I really liked they were willing to change the sides for a dish. For example, I ordered the Salmon but instead of squash, they gave me delicious sauteed kale salad! Unimportant, but they had some really cute waiters! I gotta admit though, it was really loud like some people said. Also, our waiter took a really long time attending his duties (calculating checks)  while we were waiting to order dessert. Actually, we had to leave without it because of time. Their menu I think was pretty small, but we ate there at lunch time, so I'm not sure if it expands through out the day.  The prices are somewhat pretty good, but I imagine it will add up very fast. I personally would imagine going there to spoil myself every so now and then. Another thing, if you don't live in Scottsdale locally, it's pretty far out there for some people who live out east, so if you're ever in the area, I think it's a good place to dine. Anyhow, I like the place. I think it's a really cute place to go out with a date, but if you could, maybe try eating outside, it's quite noisy and crowded inside."}
{"text":"Just had an incredible lunch at North Italia!  From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, everything was spot on!  Our wait staff was super nice, the red sangria was flavorful, the artichoke had a twist with a little fresh Parmesan on top, the chicken sandwich was really tasty and the smashed potato, a side for the sandwich was OMG great!  Can't wait for our next visit!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is really beautiful - inside and out. In the summer, they have the misters on outside, which is great. I highly recommend trying the zucchini chips! I've had their pizza and I've also tried their salad. All the food was delicious! Service is amazing from walking into the door to the servers themselves - very friendly and welcoming. Awesome place to go eat - happy hour (menu is cheaper and still really good) or otherwise!"}
{"text":"We came by on a Sunday evening (happy hour is all day on Sundays ) & had Sangria, bruschetta & zucca chips from the HH menu-all were absolutely delicious & an awesome deal. The bruschetta was unique & the zucca chips absolutely addicting! For dinner I ordered the Short Rib Radiatori-the short rib was seriously melt in your mouth & the pasta was delicious! My husband ordered the Chicken Parmesan & it's his favorite chicken parm to date (the competition is intense). The noodles that came with his had a bit of truffle oil that was the perfect touch! Not at all overpowering! Our server was Robert & he was fantastic! So fun, personable & helpful! We really enjoyed interacting with him! Great restaurant, super close...we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at North, but I'm usually heading here for their great Happy Hour specials.  You can't beat their \"bottle and board\" (bottle of red or white wine, and a chef's board) for $20, but you can also grab some pizza and other snacks for a discount price during happy hour.  Other than happy hour specials, their pricing is pretty high, but worth it.  Adding chicken to their kale salad is my favorite dish for dinner, and they have outdoor seating where you get some great people watching (and if you're lucky, one of the couches on the patio is available).  Overall, great place to eat and catch up with friends :)"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile, so decided to review on the changes.    First, love the menu updates... lots of seafood focus, with plenty of fresh salad options. My main dish was a little less exciting than it looked in the menu description, but still flavorful.  Service is swift and friendly; so no issue there.   Overall, I like it - but there isn't anything that left me wanting more. Prices are medium-high, so you could probably find other comparable restaurants to spend your dollar."}
{"text":"This review was a bit late but we went here a few months ago for my friends Birthday and it was great. Between the apps, meals and desserts we were all happy. I don't remember what everyone ordered but I remember sharing the calamari dish and the cheese,meat and veggie chef  board and they were great we could not get enough. For my entree I ordered the the Riccota Gnocchi with braised short ribs, the Gnocchi was perfectly cooked and the braised short ribs melted in your mouth. A lot of us shared our entrees with others and I got to try the bolognese with fresh pasta and there is nothing like eating fresh pasta, I also tried the fig and  prosciutto  pie and that was awesome (besides the goat cheese I do not like goat cheese. Don't judge me). I ended my night with the Bombolini , I also shared these with others and loved them along with tasting the salted caramel budino. next time I go back I am set on getting the bolognese and the Salted caramel budino. I def suggest going here the service was on point also."}
{"text":"Always SO good! My boyfriend wanted brunch but I wanted pizza so we went to north! I had the margarita pizza and added pepperoni and the small caesar. Which were amazing! He had the French toast. Which I really liked but he thought was a little too sweet."}
{"text":"A good Italian restaurant is tough to come buy, and even tougher to compare to the countless others. Thankfully North Italia separates itself from other Italian joints by its unique menu, and hearty atmosphere. On weekend nights the restaurant is poppin to the max, but during the day when I partook in dining it was slightly crowded, but still empty. The very first thing I noticed about the atmosphere was the noise. It is very very loud and tough to talk over the table to your amigos. My tip is to either sit outside or sit in the back half of the restaurant which is much more tame noise-wise. My homies and I started with the zucca chips and these were the high point of the meal. They are small slices of zucchini that are fried in oil and not are they addicting. For my main course I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs with gluten free noodles, my other amigo ordered the bolognese with gluten free noodles, and my final and least favorite amigo ordered the pig pizza. My noodles and sauce were decently good but the meatballs were made with way too much bread. My amigos bolognese was ok according to him. My amigos pig pizza really knocked this review down a star. The key to a good wood oven pizza is a good crust. And this crust was less than poppin. There was too much meat according to him and the crust was all but nonexistent under the oppression of the cheese dictator. I got an Arnold Palmer to drink and was unpleasantly surprised by the blandness of it. Believe me it is tough to screw up an Arnold Palmer but these guys managed to do it. All in all North Italia is decent but nowhere near a restaurant I would recommend."}
{"text":"Last Wed evening my nephew and I went for dinner.  The parking lot was totally jammed and the restaurant at 7pm was bursting at the seams!  It appears they had a special once a month dinner that night.  We had to sit on the patio and the evening was very warm.  What a surprise, the misting system actually made it pleasant.  We ordered fried  calamari for starters.  No dipping sauce but a grilled lemon was good on it. Next I had squid ink pasta with shrimp and calamari with a red spicy sauce, and he had the chicken parm. Both dishes were good but not fives.  We skipped the desert.  Overall a nice meal, friendly and attentive servers.   The noise level in the dinning room might have been damaging to your hearing, I found it to be painful and that made the patio even better!  I would rate the total experience a 3 !/2 stars."}
{"text":"Wow.  How do I say that in Italian?  Choices and delicious options abound at this Italian food wonderland.  Try the coffee, gelatos, pasta...  you get the idea."}
{"text":"This place has the best Italian food in scottsdale. Since moving here from the east coast it's been hard to find great Italian food, but this place surpassed my exspectations! The service is always amazing as well & there happy hour is unbeatable with their bottle of wine & a pizza for only $20!!!! I love this place if your in scottsdale & craving Italian this is a must stop!"}
{"text":"North is one of my go-to dinner places in this area.  The short rib entree never disappoints.  I'm not a huge fan of the dessert choices, but they are very good for what they are.  The ambiance is relaxing but also energetic.   The service is always exceptional."}
{"text":"After weekend business trip, we made a reservation to this place, luckily we had a wonderful corner table with fantastic waitress \"Bonnie\" she gave us seamless service , never missed  a bit even though the place was over flowing with people"}
{"text":"Just enjoyed an amazing \"community dinner\" night here!    Wow!   The food and wine was absolutely fantastic (soup, salad, main, desert).  Loved the long community dinner table style.  Great job to the entire team tonight for a top 10 meal and experience."}
{"text":"The place is amazing! Friendly staff, great atmosphere, one of my FAVORITE places.  Their Tiramisu was amazing and something we treat ourselves to every time we go.  So excited they are opening one in Cali so when I go there I have an amazing place I can have dinner.  Till next time North."}
{"text":"I love this place! Have been going here for several years....great food, great wine, great location. (Oh, and the zucca chips are seriously to die for....) Tonight, my dinner was a little less-than-awesome. (Hey - it happens, right?) I mentioned this to the waiter...who apparently mentioned it to the manager...who promptly came over and asked for my input. Genuine concern, no attitude or defensiveness whatsoever.  WOW! Customer service is one of my major pet peeves...and this was a 10++ to even the pickiest of customers.  Sure wish all restaurants would follow this example! Thank you, North, for a great evening - looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"The strozzapreti was AMAZING!  One of the best pasta dishes I've ever had.  Grilled branzino was not bad either. Soffritto on top was a little salty, but it balanced well with the fish. Would def come back!"}
{"text":"We come here often on date nights. Food is amazing, staff is even better! We love the calamari, pizza, squid ink pasta, tortelloni, short rib pasta, and especially the spaghetti and meatballs. Drinks are amazing, but we mostly finish with a dessert drink - almond milk dirty chai is delicious! ALWAYS finish with the tiramisu!"}
{"text":"Ok so I am pretty down on this place right now. I have a seasonal residence right down the street and usually enjoy coming here. Rolled into town last night and we were excited for a nice dinner. Got on open table and they showed a 7:45 reservation was available. I tried to book it and then got a weird message that they were having 'technical issues' and could not complete my reservation. So.. I call the restaurant and the lady tells me the reason I am getting the technical issues messages is because they are booked .. I was like 'well they show a table is free at 7:45' and she says 'sorry we are booked but the wait for walk ins is 30 minutes'. It was 7 at the time. hmm ok...well I thought maybe as a good faith gesture she would let us put our name on the list and we could walk over and then we could wait.  Seems like s reasonable request right? She was like, 'sorry we don't take call ins'  OK I get it. Tough luck.   Flash forward 24 hours.. Still craving some meatballs and good pizza. I call and place a takeout order. I showed up a little early. My order is not ready so I get a drink at the bar. I ordered a bulleit rye on the rocks while I wait. I watched the bartender pour and was thinking  damn that is a generous drink. I got home and checked my receipt. They had zeroed out my original drink order and replaced it with a double for $20. I did not order a double and never order a double. Maybe an honest mistake but I feel they were banking that I would not check my receipt and felt free to over charge me. I gave her a big tip thinking she was just nice.  Uber sleazy.    My takeaway - despite all the blather about this being a neighborhood place it is a part of a big chain that does not give a sh*t. Good food though!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and it's fantastic!  So good.  Ingredients made here, meat was tender and delicious for the meatballs.   It's a must place to eat when in Arizona !  You won't be disappointed.  Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We needed a place like this! Great pizza too! Quality Italian food and amazing service"}
{"text":"I absolutely love North Italia. I find that when I'm there, I can't stop staring at the restaurant. You can see the chefs in the kitchen, the harmonious sounds of plates clanking together and food being chopped, it's wonderful. The food is obviously made fresh and so delicious. I love the $20 pizza and bottle of wine happy hour deal! My favorite vegetarian item is the arancini - it's mushrooms, risotto and cheese fried and sitting in a bath of a tomato sauce that is so good I could drink it!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Can't believe this is part of a chain. The food is fresh, delicious, truly genuine. If you haven't gone, definitely go."}
{"text":"Not sure if this is my kazillionth review (lol) anyway, I had the Arancini which was delicious!!! It was rice meatball, breaded with a delicious sauce.  I like the personnel, as they are very friendly and attentive and not to mention it is (literally) 3 minutes from home  All in all, a great place to dine. Be it with a date, your friend or your spouse."}
{"text":"North...is Italian for the fucking bomb diggity!!!   So I shop at the Fresh and Easy across the street from this place and literally can walk here from my condo...to say the least I kept telling myself I was going to go for like the last few years...but had failed to do so...and since I am part Italian...I felt it almost an obligated duty to check this place out...so tonight on a whim, me and a gf went to see what all the fuss was about.   And to say the least..Woohoo! This is as good as it gets when it comes to Italian food. From start to finish, the service, the atmosphere, the food...it all was amazing.   We started out with the bruschetta...now this is not your Postino's type bruschetta...this is a do it your self sampler Chef's board bruschetta, with the freshest ingredients I have ever seen. Fresh made bread. Literally I think they made it all from scratch. I think they have some mad scientist in the back, churning fresh butter and making cheese along with growing the vegetables...I am not even kidding...almost filled up on this.  I am not a fan of olive's but my date said they were the best she has ever had. So so good.   For our main course I got the Chicken Pesto, so good...pesto pesto pesto if you like pesto this is it. Literally so much pesto even the chicken is green, smothered with pine nuts and parm cheese...literally melts in your mouth. She got the Chicken Parm. Simply Amazing...cooked to perfection. An as far as portion size...this thing was HUGE! We kept eating off each others plates...so good.   We decided if we get married North will be the place we go every year for our anniversary.   We both were so full, neither one of us even had room to try the desert.  But next time Gelato or Tiramisu for sure.  I have heard good things about this place, and am really glad we went. I heard it was pricey, but really it is not. Like $70 out the door for the two of us, and that included a few drinks and a standard 20% gratuity.   If you have not been here I would highly suggest giving it a try. So good, well worth it. Everything was excellent. Well done Fox Restaurant Concepts. Well done."}
{"text":"The potatoes here are ridiculously good.  And the castelvetrano olives with that fresh cracked sea salt... oh man. That's the stuff dreams are made of. I could probably be gluttonous and make a meal of olives and potatoes, with a Red Rooster to drink (their version of a bloody mary.) Service is usually good and my food has always come out of the kitchen quickly.  For Sunday brunch at 11am we didn't even have to wait for a table.  Prices are fair for the quality and quantity of food served.  The chicken salad sandwich is amazing.  French toast, yogurt with granola & berries are also very tasty if you're looking for breakfast.   Just in case you need extra incentive, its happy hour all day on Sunday at North!"}
{"text":"With 2 kids under 2, it is a rare event that my husband and I get to go on a date anymore, so when the grandparents offered to babysit so we could go on an early Valentines outing, I knew I wanted to pick somewhere special, without having to drive to the strip.  I could not believe how many reviews this place had after only being opened a short while, and all very good reviews!  Well let me tell you it was either the fact that a break form stay at home motherhood would have made a McDonalds date night a 5 star experience, or this place truly is amazing, and deserves all of these rave reviews! :-) It was quite busy for arriving at 4:30 and by the time we left at 6 there was already people waiting outside for a table. We started with the truffle garlic bread. I thought, how can garlic bread be any different than from any other italian place?, but oh it oh it can be! This was wonderful! For my main meal I had the short rib pasta which was pretty much perfection, and my husband had the pig pizza and the chicken parm. which he said he really liked. I tried the pasta that came with the chicken and it was great! For dessert we had the hazelnut tart. It was good, but the toffee pieces that came with it were heavenly... I would have preferred a bowl full of that! :-)  The only tiny negative was I had ordered a decaf coffee that I wanted with my dessert. Our dessert came and halfway through they asked if I still wanted it since they were making it fresh, and at that point I did not want it anymore. Really no big deal at all. The service was great, prices pretty decent, and you can tell the waiters really enjoy the food and sharing it with us. This will be our new date not spot (If we ever get to go on one again :-)) Definitely glad we tried it!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and have always had a great experience. Sitting outside is a must when the weather is cooler, it's a great atmosphere. I would recommend if you like Italian food, and ambiance."}
{"text":"The Kierland Commons is a relatively new retail development in Scottsdale. As you walk through the fake cobblestone streets and total lack of any real culture or unique character, you'll come across this bar and restaurant that, like most of the other area establishments, is managed by a corporation doing business in 3 states (and counting, probably).   Despite the setting which I'm the first to admit is not exactly my scene, I give Bar North four stars. I ordered the stromboli with sausage, crimini mushrooms and fontina, which was prepared and presented to me with a delicious, light bread crust that literally melted in my mouth. It was perfect. The setting is also pleasant and relaxing, with plenty of outdoor seating to enjoy our great weather, and an \"interior\" that's opened up to the outside so you barely feel like you're \"inside\". The service was very good. If you can somehow figure out a way to drag me to Scottsdale in the first place, I'd definitely return here to sip a wine and have an appetizer with friends."}
{"text":"I kept hoping it would be better than the hype, but it wasn't. The food was a 4, decent but not fantastic.  Then the service came and it really was subpar. I kept hoping It would get better but unfortunately it never did. I don't think I would ever come back unless i was invited by someone else. It was too bad really."}
{"text":"They really did a great job with the space it's fantastic. And one of the best build-outs off the strip for sure. The service is a little hit or miss. They need to use trays instead of hand carry everything. The menu has pretty good options, but they will probably need a chef to keep up the seasonal changes and creativity.  This place with put Honeysalt out of business for sure!"}
{"text":"The Arcadia neighborhood just keeps getting cooler. NoRTH is a Sam Fox restaurant whose concept is different from what you may be familiar with already from the north Scottsdale location.   Everything from the restaurant's decor (modeled after an Italian farmhouse) to the servers' uniforms (plaid shirts) to the menu (traditional Italian) is completely different from the NoRTH in Scottsdale. Our bartender told us this NoRTH is nicknamed \"NoRTH 40,\" and this new restaurant reflects where Fox is going with the brand, which already has five existing locations throughout the country.  The restaurant is open and airy, with one big, well-lit dining room with an open kitchen and exposed metal beams. The eatery had a good energy to it and was bustling with lots of conversation and alternative music playing in the background. There's a bar connecting the dining room to the patio, with the bar wrapping around the back of the restaurant and featuring television screens on either side. The patio has a picnic vibe to it, with tables set atop a dirt ground and a section of seats one level below the patio for lounging. The patio sort of reminded me of fellow Arcadia spot La Grande Orange's patio, but I didn't like the dirt flooring-it was too minimalist to me, and I felt like it could have been so much prettier, especially considering the high quality of the menu.  That was my general dilemma with NoRTH-while the vibe there is casual, the menu features handmade, downright fancy food-served to you by people who look like they just stepped out of Urban Outfitters. NoRTH was too busy to be considered romantic, but some menu items cost $20 or more, with the pastas and entree dishes ranging from $14-$26. I guess for the affluent people who inhabit the Arcadia neighborhood, NoRTH could be their casual dining destination, though I'm still trying to figure out what type of occasion I would return for dinner.  My favorite part about NoRTH was the food. I am not really into the whole plaid uniform thing (and that's exactly the type of style nearby Postino servers have been rocking long before), and there was nothing compelling about the atmosphere that stood out to me-and this is one patio I'd never request to sit on even though I always prefer to sit outside. That said, the food was delicious, and the cocktails were strong, though I thought the menu was better suited for a classier atmosphere.  Drinkwise, I had the Ducati ($9) a small but powerful drink made with Grappa, Hornitos Anejo Tequila, Solerno Blood Orange and agave. It tasted refreshing but strong, so I made my next Ducati tall with added soda water. If strong drinks aren't your thing, I highly recommend doing this, because the second drink was way better than the first but packed the same punch.  I also tried my companion's \"Old Roma\" ($9), made with Courvoisier, Cointreau, lemon and mint. This drink was even stronger than my original Ducati, but my pal said he loved it because he also found it refreshing.  He also got a Quiet Italian Gentleman ($10), with Bulleit Rye, Disaronno amaretto, Campari and Carpano Antiqua. This tasted like cough syrup to me, and I could barely take a sip, but he loved it. Just be warned-all their cocktails are amazingly strong and well worth the price for the amount of alcohol you get.  To begin the meal, we had a Grilled Portabella ($8), with arugula and shaved grana padano. This was a wonderful dish, with super-fresh greens and cheese that perfectly complemented the mushroom. It wasn't the most filling appetizer, but it was wonderfully made and tasted great.  For my entree, I got the Agnolotti ($15), pasta made with ricotta, mascarpone, pecorino, grana padano and herb butter. I savored every bite of this pasta that was obviously handmade. I thought it was delicious, and it's great the restaurant had such high-quality ingredients and preparation.  My pal got the Mafaldine ($17), made with spicy rock shrimp, white wine, shaved fennel, tomato, garlic, chili and basil. His dish looked and smelled amazing.  It was hard to beat the tastiness of the main course, but our \"Affogato\" desserts ($6) did just that. Vanilla gelato was topped with coffee creme and served atop melted chocolate, and I loved every bit of it. This was the first time I've ever had a dessert like this, and it was so yummy.  While I probably wouldn't come back to NoRTH Arcadia for dinner because the ambiance just doesn't jive with the menu to me, I think it's a great lunch option if you're in the area. Their lunch menu includes sandwiches ranging between $9-$11 in addition to the dinner pastas offered, and I bet the restaurant is beautiful during the day because of how much sun comes in."}
{"text":"When it is 50 degrees outside, there is absolutely no reason to have both doors and the partition between the bar and patio open. The manager refused to close the doors when we asked. Also, someone arrived after us, without reservation, and was seated before us. We haven't even got to the food yet; what a beginning to the meal!  Update: the manager, German, and waitress were great. The food was flavorful: I recommend the garlic bread as well as the spaghetti and meatballs. We will go back...when the temperature outside is higher."}
{"text":"The mussels. Were amazing for apetizer, the rosmary chicken was good, the desert was amaziiing, I loves the service, soo soo nice experience"}
{"text":"I first encountered NoRTH years ago in Tucson. It was a first of its kind in the land south of Phoenix with a new, swanky and trendy vibe along with good food and fun times. So, when I moved to Phoenix, I was sure to check this one out.   Fast forward a \"couple\" years and I still frequent NoRTH whenever I'm up near Kierland. After my most recent visit, I realized that I have yet to review them, so here it goes! Happy Hour. That's it. OK, I'll keep going, but I could just stop there. NoRTH has a stellar happy hour. You just can't beat the $2.50 beers, $4.00 well drinks and glasses of wine starting at just $3. The happy hour goes until 6:00, so it's worth the hustle to get there in time.   Now moving on to the food. I like the food at NoRTH because it's hearty and light at the same time. You ask how? Well, it's Italian food, but it's northern Italian which means the items are much lighter than the south with their hefty meat sauces, etc. To start, I adore the zucca chips, bruschetta and trio of spread. And let me add a little fun fact here. Each of those items are on happy hour! The zucca chips are light, thin little morsels with just a hint of zucchini and the right amount of salt. The bruschetta is my favorite because of the prosciutto atop a crescenza cheese. The bread is the right amount of hard and soft at the same time and it's the perfect way to start a meal. Or, if you just want something light yet filling for a meal itself, this would do the trick. As for entrees, I enjoy the Fennel Sausage and Pepperoni pizza, Baked Ziti Bolognese with spinach, ricotta & mozzarella cheese and the plates of the day are all excellent!   So on that note, I end the tale about my experiences with my first Sam Fox restaurant: NoRTH."}
{"text":"I think I've found a new addition to my Arcadia list of likes! I remember NoRTH from my days of U of A. It was the first of its kind of Tucson and the place for college kids to go if they wanted to feel \"grown up\" and for the small group of young professionals who live in Tucson to hang out at night. Well, fast forward some years and Sam Fox has now opened up another NoRTH location in the Arcadia hood and I'm a huge fan!   I've been here a couple times now and I've been happy with every visit. I absolutely loved the anti-pasta boards which come with your choice of cheese, meat and accompanied by sourdough bread. It's a perfect meal for lunch if you feel like sharing that and a salad. There paninis are buttery deliciousness! Be prepared that these guys are not low-cal, but if you're in the mood for some delicious buttery bread sandwiched with creamy cheese and yummy meat, this is for you. My favorite is the salumi which is a combination of meat and cheese. As for the pizzas, again this is no low-cal option but they are soft and crunchy at the same time and come in a variety of flavors.   I love the decor of NoRTH. It feels like there should be an ocean or lake right outside the doors and I really enjoy the open environment of this converted car wash. The high ceilings and open doors make the restaurant open and airy. There's plenty of seating including bar seating along with dining seating. This would be a good spot to either go for some drinks and appetizers or a full meal.   Thanks for bringing a tasty addition to the Arcadia neighborhood!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have gone here twice for date night. Both times were excellent. They have vegetarian options for me and meat options for the husband.  For appetizers, it's hit and miss on whether the one you choose will be available. I've tried and failed twice to get the artichoke appetizer and I really want to try it.  We have tried the zuca chips, which are yummy but the portion is probably enough for 3-4 people. Also their truffle garlic bread is AH-MAZ-ING! You must try it at least once! My husband had some mussels or clams and enjoyed them. You can also get a basket of bread but it's never just brought out, you have to ask.  We both tried the spaghetti and it was delicious and I felt the like portion was perfect when having appetizers too.  The desserts were ok. Nothing terribly special, the wine was good, but my husband wasn't overly excited with the beer selection. He did try an interesting coffee beer though.  Overall, great atmosphere, wonderful staff and delicious food! Worth the visit."}
{"text":"Great place with great food and great staff.  I know that's a lot of 'great', but I enjoyed the restaurant very much.  Shout out to Chelsea.  She was a wonderful server.  I will go back soon,"}
{"text":"Went with my husband for dinner Saturday night. Had reservations and we were seated very quickly once we arrived. Everyone was polite and attentive. Waitress was very helpful and sweet. Had the white truffle garlic bread, meatballs, Cesar salad and short rib pasta along with a spinach chicken mushroom pasta and all were spectacular! We will def be back."}
{"text":"I wanted a beet salad and my co-worker recommended this place since I had one of the best beet salads I have ever had at the sister restaurant, the Arrogant Butcher.  The place was packed when we arrived for lunch but we were seated promptly.    We split an order of calamari and I opted for the beet salad and we finished with the chocolate tort.  The calamari was served on a bed of arugula and was delicious but I would have preferred if the breading of the calamari were a little crisp.  The lemon vinaigrette added some nice acidity to the dish and it was overall pretty tasty.  The beet salad was good and had a bunch of nice elements.  There was an ample amount of golden beets which were delicious and the hazelnuts added some nice texture and the apples slices were crispy and sweet.  the ricotta cheese helped in the presentation but didn't do much in terms of overall taste of the dish.  I liked the salad, but it still was not as good as the one I had at the Arrogant Butcher.  For dessert, my colleague and I shared the chocolate tort which was decadent.  Nice texture and the dessert was topped with a Nutella mousse.  There were some nuts (pecans?) that added some nice crunch as well.  Our server was great - I forgot his name but he was extremely friendly and was on top of things."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome first impression on our first visit. The patio accommodates dogs. The food was fantastic. We did a meat and cheese board and I had the pasta special. I could tell the pasta was hand made or at least made fresh. Great place to just hang out and have some wine. The bar is set up pretty cool, too. This would be a good casual date night out or day with the dog (or wife and kid if they are behaving)."}
{"text":"Made it back here for dinner - the ceasar salad could have been cut a little smaller, but tasty.  Their Italian bread's light and crusty, but the scallops were absolutely delicious!  Seared and rare with fresh pasta... mmm...mmm good.  Had to send the mushy mussels back, but dinner redeemed itself.  Service was very attentive and pleasant - John was his name.  The manager made a showing at the table (nice).  For dessert, go for the chocolate sea salt caramel whatever that was!  Delicious!"}
{"text":"North is the first restaurant I've found in Scottsdale where I thought \"this is a sophisticated restaurant\".  There are many expensive and pretentious restaurants in the area, but few come close to living up to their reputations - North is the exception.  The food was fabulous.  With a great atmosphere, a well trained staff, and locavore based Italian food, it was really good.  It's on a small street in a mall complex, so I never would have found out about it without the recommendation of a friend who lives in Scottsdale.  With so many mediocre restaurants getting good Yelp reviews here, it's hard to separate the truly good from the merely reasonably good based on Yelp stars, but North is exceptional.  We sampled several appetizers (cauliflower, grilled artichoke, braised meatballs, calamari), all good, especially the grilled cauliflower. We also had five different entrees (short ribs, rosemary chicken, grilled branzino, scallops, Caesar salad), all of which I can recommend.  North is not inexpensive, but it is definitely worth more than one visit.  I do suggest reservations, as walk-ins can wait a long time before being seated."}
{"text":"Visited North Italia recently for a business lunch (there were 10 of us). I haven't been to this location yet so I was looking forward to visiting. I had the Fig and Prosciutto pizza and we all started with the Zucca Chips (VERY YUMMY) and my co-workers had pasta, sandwiches or salads. All of our food came out at the same time and my pizza was great (like always). Service was great as well!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really good, authentic, and overall delicious. Make a reservation.  For appetizers, we started with a chef's board, which was REALLY good. There was actually a lot of food, and after asking for some extra bread, we cleaned it up (family of 5, 3 teenage boys). We got an arugula and fennel salad, which was very good and had a nice lemon flavor. We also ordered the crispy calamari, which was the BEST calamari I've ever tried. Absolutely fantastic. We added on some mushroom tortellini, which was good and tasted very fresh. Definitely 5-star appetizers.  For entree, we ordered 1 bolognese, a fungi pizza, shortrib, strozzapreti, and a squid ink pasta. The bolognese was good- traditional and hearty. The squid ink pasta was not too good. It was weirdly spicy (but not excessively so) but really did not have much flavor. Don't get it. The strozzapreti was AWESOME- so flavorful and delicious. The shortrib was excellent. It was deliciously soft and flavored well with red wine, and the polenta it came with was sooooo good. Also got a fungi pizza, which was a lot. 5-Star entrees if you know what to order- just avoid the squid ink. Entrees are good sized- not like most good restaurants. They give medium-large portions.  4 appetizers, 3 entrees, and 3 desserts was a bit much, again for family of 5 which 3 teenage boys.   For dessert, we ordered a tiramisu, affogato, and bordini. The tiramisu was good, but the bordini was AMAZING. Absolutely FABULOUS. Among the best desserts I've had and will ever have- like a salted caramel milkshake that's super creamy in a single AMAZING bite that's just so elevated. The affogato was ok. Solely the bordini was so good it was worth it.   awesome 5-Star meal, definitely will come back for happy hour. Awesome service, expensive (but reasonably so) prices, good portions, 10 minutes wait time, and DELICIOUS meal."}
{"text":"While visiting friends in Arizona they suggested we go to North Italia in Scottsdale for appetizers. We were game since  the restaurant recently opened a location at home in Las Vegas and it is on our to do list. We arrived during Happy Hour and the service was prompt and friendly. For our table of 5 we ordered the Bruschetta with tomato instead of prosciutto and the Chef's Board.   The Bruschetta was juicy and tomatoes piled high. The Chef's Board included prosciutto, olives, cheese,  grilled asparagus and chutney. A side order of sliced bread and olive oil/balsamic was complementary for the table. All of the appetizers were delicious and the portions plentiful. Overall quality and value hit the spot."}
{"text":"Always great, fresh, tasty, trendy. Got in just before happy hour ended so enjoyed a little discount on zucca chips. Short rib radiatori pasta, prosciutto/fig/goat cheese pizza & salted caramel budino our favorites. Wonderfully friendly service from Nicole!"}
{"text":"We returned. Great meal. Hubs had salmon and I had a wonderful pasta dish with chicken. Yummy! I'd give it a 5 but very slow on refilling water and tea and taking order. SAt a while before getting menus. Had to take water glass to front of place to get a refill."}
{"text":"Been meaning to write about this place for so some time as I have eaten here  on a few occasions. Fox group never disappoints. North is exactly right. The food is wonderful and well priced. The staff are always friendly and know what they are doing from hostess, to servers to bar staff to management this is a well trained team. Obviously the back of house staff is on parr as the food here is always a delight and offers something for every palate.  Look up the menu online for details.  The BEST thing about North is their m-f happy hour specials! Decent red and White House wine and other drinks on special. Be sure to take a friend and have the Bottle and Board: a chef's board with meats, cheeses, nuts, olives, chutney, peppers served with fresh Italian bread with a bottle of house red or white for $20!! We sat at the bar and noticed that it seems the place to be to get a Friday night started. Lots of little clicks of guys and gals eyeing one another up over cheap nosh and booze! Definitely a go to for all the singles looking to mingle.  The place has several bike racks, and as we live a short pedal down the canal it's perfect for those like myself who like to justify pounding snacks and booze by imagining that the 15min totally flat ride there somehow counts as exercise! Fox group is hands down the most innovative and imaginative restaurant company and I happily continue to delight in frequenting their fine establishments. See you at the bar Friday at 5!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant- they make their pasta in house and I always eat every bit of it. They have amazing Sangria and it is a rustic modern atmosphere that welcomes all who enter! Definitely give North a try :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Visiting Phoenix for business and have been very impressed with the food scene. This restaurant had some of the best pasta I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"Let's be real..Fox Restaurant Concepts just know what's good with food. North is definitely one of my go-to Italian spots. I have been here on a few occasions and the thing that I really love about this restaurant is the atmosphere. You can honestly come here for a relaxing happy hour or get dressed up and come here for date night. Okay now let's skip the small talk and get to the food....zucca chips are a MUST every time you visit here especially if they are on happy hour. I have tried a few other appetizers like the arancini and garlic bread and they were both amazing. For entrees, the short rib pappardelle is incredible. I'm not a fan of horseradish so I order it without the horseradish topping and it's amazing. Also, they have a really good bolognese too. Desserts here are also pretty top notch. All around a great neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Eh, it's alright.  I do have to say it's a fantastically designed interior.  Kudos to whoever had a hand in that.  However, I hate to say the food is not impressive.  At all.  The bread served was average but my entrée (a four cheese pasta) as well as my friends (spaghetti and meatballs, sausage pizza) were nothing to write home about.  There were no \"oh, this is good!\", or \"I'd definitely come back!\"s. Just kind of....eh. The spaghetti sauce.....holy over use of fennel! Yikes.  After my first visit there, I was asked out on a date who suggested NoRTH.  I gave it a second chance and I have to say that the lasagna was above and beyond anything else I'd tried there.  Unfortunately, I'd rather not patronize a restaurant with one item on the menu I enjoy."}
{"text":"The food, service, and atmosphere were all great. Unfortunately my boyfriend and I both got an upset stoafter eating the food. (Even the leftovers the following day). I got the funghi pizza and he got the pig pizza. I'm not sure if the dough had something wrong with it or what, but it wasn't very fun at all. This doesn't mean I wouldn't return, I'd just be a bit more cautious. Other than that my pizza was awesome. Seriously, I loved it, it was delicious. Things just got horrible after we digested."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best Italian restaurants in Vegas !!! The food is soo good. I always get the burrata and the Italian grinder is amazing !! I 100% recommend this place !!"}
{"text":"We had 6pm reservations (made over 2 weeks in advance). We did not get a table until 6:50. It took over an hour and a half to get our food and it did not come out together...the manager said they would take care of the appetizers (it didn't happen). We wound up paying and leaving after 9pm. Sad thing is the food is delicious and the wait staff was friendly... they need MAJOR HELP managing the kitchen. We will not be back....."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant while in town and it was so good I had to go back. The service is pretty good, drinks took a little while. The vibe is good and decor is really cute, although it got a little loud. But the food is amazing. Their pasta dishes are so good! I had the short rib pasta dish both times and just wish I lived in the area so that I could it order it again!"}
{"text":"We just love it here. We came for happy hour tonight, probably stayed for three hours between happy hour and dinner...not only is it a great value for awesome food (hellllllloooo homemade pasta!), but the service gets better every time we visit. Our server tonight, Olivia, and the manager, Inad, we're both attentive, knowledgeable and gave us just enough attention without over-crowding us. We will be back (probably weekly!)."}
{"text":"Update: Management totally stepped it up. I know 'stuff' happens. Robertsen contacted me immediately and couldn't be more apologetic and completely stepped it up with offering me to come back 'on him.' I wasn't sure when I'd be back in Arcadia so he sent me a gift card to come back and I will.  Thank you North Italia, Robertsen & FRC."}
{"text":"Such a cute experience! Had a great waitress and I regret not getting her name. A girlfriend and I shared a pitcher of sangria, chef's board, and an all meat pizza. It was a perfect late lunch and everything was delicious. Definitely recommend the chef's board (picture attached). It was a perfect little starter and such yummy options."}
{"text":"Love all the white wines here, nice hostesses..love the lively atmosphere and great misters outside too"}
{"text":"Holy crap! Just go here. Just shut up and go. Don't bitch about the wait. Hire someone to wait in line for you if you hate waiting, I'm sure there's an app for that. Or make reservations but at least at the moment of writing this review you have to book two weeks out.   I don't throw around the word 'love' loosely. I love my wife, I love making love (to my wife), and I love this restaurant. If I could do all three at the same time without raising the attention of local law enforcement, I would."}
{"text":"Good classic Italian food with very fresh ingredients. We got the funghi and pig pizzas. Both were really good with a crispy base and crust. The crust is less chewy and glutinous than most Neapolitan pizzas. The crust at Doughbird is chewier. It's really good just depends on what you like. The toppings are well portioned and delicious. We also ordered the chicken Parmesan. It was yum with a nice thin cutlet and plenty of fresh melted mozzarella. Overall this is a great go to place. There is a large group table you can reserve in the center of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour Sunday, ordered a Sangria. It was so bitter I couldn't drink it. The waiter didn't charge me for it when I said I just couldn't stand it. Thanks for that.. Ordered a plain vodka martini instead. \"Well\" nothing fancy, $10.00 !! During happy hour? Ordered a Cezar Salad, very very ho hum..  Won't do that again. Finished with a $6.00 dessert. It was like something I could have picked up at the 2nd day bakery at Safeway. $32.00 by the time I finished. Outrageous for a so so experience. You can keep that Fox disaster. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my experience at North. My boyfriend and I love a late dinner on the weekends and to our surprise we were one of the few couples dining in the restaurant around 8:45 on a Saturday night but I guess that's pretty typical for Glendale.  Our server was one of the best I have had- thorough (but not too OCD), menu savvy, and friendly (but not in your face). We each started with a great glass of wine (that was \"accidental\" poured to a glass and a half) and split the spinach and goat cheese salad. I went with the ahi tuna for my meal and my boyfriend had the pork tenderloin. The tuna was SO good-cooked to perfection and served with \"whatever green vegetable they had\" which happen to be broccoli, spinach and green beans. Mmm! The tenderloin was served with mashed potatoes and some kind of tasty sauce. Both of our plates were empty at the end of dinner.   The ambiance at North was wonderful but it worries me when a restaurant is so quiet on a Saturday night. I hope for their sake that business picks up. In the mean time, I know we will be return customers."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed in my cup of soup. Seven dollars and barely a third of a cup and no bread! I was so surprise by the poor quantity that I asked the server if I could have some bread which she promptly brought however for that amount of money I should get bread anyway! Also ordered the pizza margarita which had no flavor whatsoever, although the crust was nice and crunchy. I had hoped they would have had beer on tap but nope! My beer was canned and it was very disappointing. Would not return."}
{"text":"Had our first dinner at NoRTH last night. I'm sure it won't be our last.   Pros- Within walking distance from home. We didn't have to worry about parking, but I understand that is an issue for some. By now this should be expected for the 40th and Camelback establishments. This area was not always zoned for restaurants, so plan accordingly.  The building is beautiful. Very welcoming, open, modern, rustic chic. I feel that they captured the essence of what this kind of dining should be. You are all enjoying good food and good company in one large room. Kind of like a really beautiful wedding reception somewhere in wine country.   THE SERVICE. I know that you can have great and horrible service in any restaurant at any time. It depends on the server. Our server, Michael (slim, blonde hair), was perfect. He was attentive, friendly, informative (without seeming to be giving a scripted run down) Mediocre service is so prevalent, and I hope that his managers know what an asset they have in him. He even offered to explain any menu items that may be unfamiliar in a way that seemed helpful instead of demeaning.  Tables are in very close proximity to each other. Like most people, I am normally not a fan of this. Surprisingly, for whatever reason, this didn't bother me during my visit. The atmosphere is so convivial and relaxed that I actually didn't mind having others so close.  Cons- I have no real cons. Anything I could offer here would be mere suggestions. As has been the case for most FOX restaurants I have visited, the food is consistently interesting and good. I continue to frequent these places for the atmosphere, service, and good food. I have yet to find anything on their menus that I crave or remember for months following, but I do always know that I will have an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"North might be one of my new favorite restaurants! We tried it for the first time last night and loved it. If you make it for happy hour, you can get a great deal with a pizza and bottle of wine for $20. We did that with red wine and a margarita pizza, probably the best margarita pizza I've ever had.   We also split the chicken pesto pasta with pine nuts and capers, that was amazing! I also recommend their tiramisu, which comes with delicious little chocolate balls on top.   The atmosphere is great as well, kind of like an aluminum barn with lots of windows and really pretty decor. I'll definitely be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went there yesterday for happy hour. At first we didn't expect much but it turn out to be such a fun evening. We end up finish 2 bottles of wines and some drinks lol. Great atmosphere, good food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Came back.  Wasn't impressed this time.  Red sauce just didn't have that zing to it.  Just seemed off as compared to my first visit.  Service was prompt."}
{"text":"If I had to choose a favorite Fox restaurant, it would be North!  I particularly love this Arcadia location, the floor plan is a bit less crowded, in door or out door seating, and a view of Camelback!  So many good options!  The pig pizza is totally worth the indulgence and the sea salt on the crust is the perfect finishing touch.  You can't go wrong with a few appetizers and the chef's board or soup and salad.  My favorite arancini in the valley, the grilled artichoke is perfection, the meatballs are great, and that truffle garlic bread, YUM!  Not to mention the pasta, which is wonderful as well!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service   Great pasta- great meatballs and a fabulous selection of vino"}
{"text":"My Mom and I wanted to try a new place today and North Italia popped up on Yelp. Done! First of all I am stoked to see Flower Child is finally coming to Vegas in the same shopping center, but that's a review for another time! This area is undergoing a huge facelift, and North Italia is one of the new tenants. We were greeted with a warm welcome and the decor and atmosphere are very modern and relaxed. It feels super hipster but not pretentious. You can see the hustle and bustle of the kitchen through windows, and the kitchen is just as nice as the rest of the restaurant.  We started with the garlic truffle bread. It was heavenly! We ate about half of it (it was a generous portion) and I took the rest home to my husband, who devoured it. Mom got the chicken pesto and I got the spaghetti and meatballs. Mine was good. You can tell the noodles are fresh made. But that chicken pesto was out of this world! It is VERY green and looked a little off putting at first glance but it's tasty. There was a very generous amount of chicken-seriously it was a whole breast. The pine nuts and capers added a nice crunch. The service was good and we we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This review is for 4.5 stars.  Really solid new casual Italian restaurant in Summerlin.  Good happy hour, patio perfect for nice days or brunch, and solid wine by the glass list.  You can even get a few more ounces at a discounted price for most pours.  Although the beer list could use some help as there's only about a dozen total bottle/draft.  Menu is new Italian with tons of small plates and appetizers, pizzas for $14, and pastas around $20.  Everything seems sharable from the portion size to the tapas pricing.  The fig pizza, with some added prosciutto, was fantastic.  Tons of meat and thicker crust than your typical craft pizza.  Prosciutto is super thin and perfect compliment to the crust.  The cauliflower appetizer was fine with a few asparagus and an egg, but nothing more than a small opener to a delicious pizza entree.  The restaurant interior is really modern and the bar area is huge.  I would 100% be back for brunch, Happy Hour, or another dinner.  Local option that's perfect for a night out without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"The pizza, dessert, wine - everything is good here ! It's fun to watch them make the dough :) and the lights make it very pretty !"}
{"text":"Stopped in for appetizers and drinks.  Saw a video review online and it looked great. We were going to get the chef's board but decided to go with the meatballs and the tomato/burratta salad.  Really can't say more than it was excellent.  Was wondering why place seemed small and bartender / server told us that there's actually two sides , one is general dining and one is like \"rent out\" or private space , but they serve lunch on both sides. Def confusing because we came from Kierland walking in so we wouldn't have known this.  Great place, can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I have had a lot of four star experiences lately, but I think this one has great potential to move up to five stars.  We dropped by North for lunch while cruising around the Kierland area this weekend.  It is breath of fresh air amidst all of the chains...I mean, I know Fox Restaurant Concepts has local chains, but it is not the typical fare found on every corner of the Phoenix metro area.    I believe the tag line at North is \"Modern Italian Cuisine\".  From what I can tell, that fits quite well.  While I went the salad route, with a spinach and goat cheese salad, adding pulled chicken, the rest of the menu had more of an Italian feel.  My salad had a great flavor and was huge.  My husband got the \"Not Your Typical\" Chicken Lasagna.  It was fantastic.  He was definitely the big winner.  Somehow North manages to make a cheeseless lasagna fantastic.  We also shared a side of asparagus and it was cooked nicely.    I would definitely go back to North and look forward to trying dinner and more of the Italian dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"The food was good, so why one star?  The ambiance was lacking, specifically the music was intrusive.  A very loud heavy beat going pound pound pound. It was like sitting next to a car with a loud stereo at a stop light.  Seemed very incongruous.  I asked the waitress if it could be turned down, she replied cheerily \"sure\".  Then the manager came over and said it was all or nothing with the music.  I requested nothing and he said he couldn't  do that.    Appetisers were good, ordered a pasta dish Strozzapreti.  Made sure garlic was not included  in the ingredients on the menu.  I know what would one expect at an Italian restaurant, garlic is common and usually listed.  I have a reaction to garlic and avoid it.  You guessed the rest, the dish has a normal amount of garlic.   Service was not terrible but far from memorable.  My biggest complaint is the loud music.  I have to add the food was good, the experience disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm a bit biased since I live in the neighborhood...but, I can eat my weight in pasta at North. The bolognese, which no joke I've eaten once a week for the last month..is amazing and I don't overuse that word like a typical white girl. The open air bar is perfect this time of year and since I dine alone, it's really nice to always meet fun people. Happy hour is solid and the bartenders are friendly..double thumbs up"}
{"text":"On a trip to Phoenix from Seattle came in here with my family.  I had the pleasure of having the ricotta nochi.  It was delicious and homemade and the braised beef was tender and delicious.  They were having some sort of shift change so we did not get service for a long while but the server made it up to us with a free dessert.  The calamari was exceptional also with some very fresh greens to accompany it.  All in all a very decent restaurant."}
{"text":"My first experience was To Go. I snuck a little taste of my Chicken Parm and had to pull the car over and keep eating. Yes, it was that good."}
{"text":"Almost $100 worth of mostly MEEH.  First off our server was wonderful, but it went downhill fast as soon as the food started to arrive. The Italian Farm Salad arrived first and was the highlight of the evening. It was split for us ($2 charge) and was very fresh and flavorful. The Steamed PEI Mussels arrived before we even had a chance to take our first bite of Salad. As we were at a table for 2 there really wasn't much room for everything. Poor timing if any timing at all. Was almost like they were trying to give fast service to lunch patrons instead of people trying to enjoy dinner. Can you say \"Hurry Up\" and finish any clearer?  Then upon opening my first mussel at first I thought it had fallen out of the shell and into the broth. But no, it was there. It was about the size of a dime and shriveled up. Things didn't get any better for the mussels. The largest one was no larger then a nickel and the broth was very, VERY salty, Did I mention the broth was salty? When we noted the size of the mussels to our server she said they we just glad to have some as for quite awhile they were unavailable. Note to Fox Restaurant Concepts: Don't serve sub-standard food.  Then came the Main Entrees. Mine was the Spicy Shrimp. I believe it is paired poorly with the Malfaldine pasta. Not that the pasta was bad, it was actually quite good but it is a long length of shaped pasta which is not very easily twirled around one's fork. I couldn't decide whether to cut it (blasphemy in my world) or twirl it so I did a bit of both. It just didn't eat well and, I hate to say it, was also quite a bit salty. Now I am not shy of using and adding salt when needed. As a matter of fact I have over a dozen different salts at home and most nights dining out we bring my own small container. So for me to say something is salty, it's extremely so.  The next entree was the Seared Diver's Scallops with Celery Root Risotto. They were definitely seared but were ok. But the Risotto was dry, gummy and tasteless. Think of oatmeal that's been cooked and just sitting in the pan for ohh, say an hour or so and you'll get the consistency.  So let's add this up: 1 split salad 1 split appetizer 2 entrees 1 wine glass 1 beer  Just under $100 for a meal which was not enjoyed. I felt like I wasted my time and my money. I for one will not be going back to NoRTH Italia and question whether FRC will get any more of my time or money."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim for happy hour, but ended up with a lot more than we expected. Started off with the amazing $20 bottle of wine and pizza of the day which was amazing. I always judge how good a pizza is by if i want to eat the crust at the end... well i did, so good sign! Our amazing server entered the wrong item so the chef asked him to go ahead and bring it to us which was this awesome display of deliciousness in the pic. We then ordered the burrata cheese appetizer. I've had burrata at other places before and I will sadly have to say this wasn't my favorite. I can not place my finger on what it was that didn't work well for me with the dish, but it lacked something. We ended our meal with the Carmel dessert. It was amazing!! We literally should have ordered our own. To top it off, I love the venue super trendy and well lit. Good vibe and our server knocked it out of the park! Yes i know... i should have gotten his name."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. OK service. Have been there several times. Their spaghetti sauce is extremely salty. Told the server about it this time. He couldn't have been less interested. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here with the family.  I have discovered my personal favorite pasta dish here and that is the Ricotta Gnocchi.  The Gnocchi is fresh made and taste wonderful with braised short rib, horseradish crema and wilted arugula.  My wife had the Grilled Branzino and it also was an amazing dish.  If your planning on walking in for dinner try to show up early to put your name in.  Very busy place but worth the wait for amazing food!"}
{"text":"Good food and a good atmosphere. The staff was very friendly and really liked their jobs!  Need to get some coconut rum in stock!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today and had the salmon filet on butternut squash with spinach & sweet onions. It was excellent. My husband had the pizza with figs, goat cheese and prosciutto and followed it with the banana nutello crepe. All was delicious and the service was top notch!"}
{"text":"Thought we would try this place on Sunday evening. It was not really crowded yet very noisy. Service was good and HH is all day on Sunday. We ordered lots. Stated with the various meats cheeses olives almonds chutney and bread. Then came the meatballs and Spaghetti, Italian salad and Chicken Parm. Everything wa good."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite meals in a while.   We started by getting a couple drinks. The bartenders need more room back there.... BUT were awesome and friendly.   The server was great he was attentive but not annoying.   We started with the Italian Salad, amazing Bread and oil and balsamic, was good The braised beef gnocchi was fantastic!  The wife loved her wine and her after dinner coffee."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant shortly after they opened and everything tasted really good!! I particularly highly recommend the fried calamari, one of my best one. I didn't have time to try their pizza but I will for sure next time!!"}
{"text":"The food was okay but the portion sizes where the smallest I have ever seen....and I am a regular to fox restaurants.    Babbo is much better."}
{"text":"Holy hell. Go here. Best meal I've had in a longggg time. Every single thing was incredible. The sangria is delicious. White truffle garlic bread was amazing. Calamari is the best I've ever had - not greasy and breaded, just light and crispy. The scallops with Parmesan risotto was to die for. And the desserts were DIVINE. Tiramisu, bundino, and hazelnut torta.   On top of all the amazing food, our service was absolutely fantastic. Even comped the birthday dessert. Hands down best meal experience I've had in ages.   Tip - make a reservation, it's busy and for very good reason."}
{"text":"After our third try to eat here we finally got a seat on a Saturday night. The vibe is mostly large gatherings and families. Kids running around, chatter loud enough to make talking difficult. The food was good and was presented in good quality. The waiter was attentive but looked burnt out and going through the motions. There was nothing exceptional about the place and if we go back it'll be during a weekday where there isn't a playground of children running through the place hopefully. Above average for the Italian food in Phoenix but nothing like NY or other places where Italian cuisine has a real foothold."}
{"text":"Love this place ever since they've changed their style and menu. Delicious food, great prices, and amazing Sangria. The salmon with pesto pasta is also amazing."}
{"text":"Just tried this place and LOVED it. We started with Spicy Lobster Bisque (soup of the day)... holy WOW!  This soup was so creamy, slightly spicy, rich, decadent... delicious.  I wound up ordering the Patata Pizza and was in love.  Great crust, the egg was done perfectly, and the cheese was almost meaty.  The BF ordered the Grinder sandwich and it was equally tasty.  The service was... new.  Sweet, sweet girl, but brand new and a little awkward.  She will do well in time.   I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I went to North twice this week for Restaurant Week (two separate groups of friends picked North...what are the odds with all the other restaurant choices??). I don't venture up to Kierland too often, so dining at North two nights was a good excuse to go up there and do some shopping.  The first night I went to North was with a group of 7. We sat inside, which is dimly lit and contemporary feeling. Be warned it is really noisy, so don't expect to be able to carry on a conversation with any one other than the people seated next to you and directly across. Our waiter was friendly and helpful in helping some friends choose wine. However, he didn't check on us often and let us sit a long time before taking our orders. The whole night everything was just really spaced out...but not in a good way. Since I was going back to North the next night, I opted to not do the RW menu and just ordered a caesar salad. The waiter specifically asked if I wanted it with my friends' appetizers or as the main course and I very clearly said as the main course. Well, guess what? My salad came out with their appetizers, and thus, I had the pleasure of sitting there with no food while they ate their entrees!! Grr! The salad was fine as caesar salads go, but definitely not memorable. I did also sample a friend's trio of spreads appetizer which was awesome. The garlic bread was perfection.  Night two of my RW North dining experience was with a girlfriend and we took advantage of the pleasant evening weather by sitting on the patio. If I go back to North, I will only sit on the patio. It was such a calm experience after the noisiness of the night before. Our waitress, really rushed us which was disappointing. This time I did order the RW menu:   *caprese salad - blob of mozzarella instead of slices - I prefer slices...but on the plus side the mozzarella was very fresh and tasty. Tomatoes were just ok *scallops - fine enough to eat two and a half of the four that came on the plate, but definitely not exceptional. They didn't melt in my mouth which is the sign of a perfectly cooked scallop. These were a bit too chewy for my liking *hazelnut chocolate cake - the highlight of the meal. While the cake was delicious, it was a bit too rich for me (I am not a sweets person). However, the vanilla bean gelato that came with it was awesome.   Overall, both nights, the people I dined with found parts of their meals really good and other parts just OK, if not a bit disappointing. Like the food, service from one night to the next was not consistent. North is a 3.5 star place, but I'm rounding down to 3 because I wasn't impressed enough where I feel I should make special trips to Kierland to dine here."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant in Kierland!  I like their setup; modern and contemporary feel. They have a decent size patio which extends around the building - smart! Always makes the place looks hoping even with no one inside.  Happy Hour is decent 1/2 glasses of wine and some appetizers.  I ordered their pizza and at first I wasn't sure by looking at it, but rest assure...it's damn good!  I just wish it this place wasn't so far \"NoRth\" -- har har, if it was just tad bit closer I wouldn't mind attending often"}
{"text":"NoRTH is a great place to go for lunch or happy hour if your near Kierland. This is one of the better Fox restaurants with great food, fantastic service with a somewhat trendy northern Italian decor.  We miss their location on the west side on 67th.  They offer a lighter side of Italian cuisine with an emphasis on freshness. This is not the place to go if your looking for the heaver side of Italian with loaded meaty sauces and carb-o-roma items galore.  They offer some classic carb loaded dishes and pizzas. But for the most part they offer several wonderful dishes on the lighter side with loads of fresh grilled seafood, chicken and veggies.    Their zucca chips or bruschetta with prosciutto and crescenza cheese are great starters with a glass of wine. The baked ziti bolognese with spinach, ricotta & mozzarella cheese is delish,  The pasta with butternut squash is also very good.  I always order their grilled chicken sandwich with a side of seasonal grilled veggies or their ahi tuna salad which is devine.    Their happy hour is fantastic with bargains on drinks and several apps. They have great service and will accommodate most special request for those with special dietary needs."}
{"text":"The farm salad was very good. The short rib was also good and the filet was fine but just not great. I also enjoyed the artichoke. The service was good and I enjoyed my time there.   This place was good but just not great I would say that you should enjoy it with good friends but the food is not good enough to overcome bad company so I will give it 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"I came back with my girlfriends after three days. I ordered their salmon! It was so delicious. Service is great, parking is convenient, love the wine selection, love the brushetta, can't wait to be back with my boyfriend"}
{"text":"I've been going to North ever since it opened. Actually my whole family has been going there for a long time and the four of us are pretty damn hard to please. Dinner here is consistently good. WARNING: Parking is a bitch at dinner time but worth the hassle.  Favorite dish:  Pasta Bolognese - oversized shell pasta with seriously, the best meat sauce i've had in Phoenix, all toped with melted cheese.   The atmosphere is chic and modern with glass windows that look out on Kierland Commons. Can be noisy at times given the space is somewhat small and the bar and kitchen is open to the restaurant.  All in all...North is one of my favorite places to eat for many years."}
{"text":"Nice Italian restaurant located at the Kierland Common, I frequent here for business lunch.   Service here is always good, all the servers I encountered is really professional and efficient.   Food here is always good, never had any bad meals. I tried most everything on the menu and all are equally good.   They have good desert menu and I like their tiramisu here.  This review I wrote here is so generic, it's not really helpful but one thing I can say is I can always count on their consistent service and food. So reliable that I frequent here for business lunch."}
{"text":"Went there the other day for dinner and I had the Strozzapreti.    Yummmmers!!   It is pasta with grilled chicken, and pine nuts, spinach, mushrooms, and parmesan .   The chicken was grilled to perfection.    I like the flavor of pine nuts, and it could definitely be tasted.   It had the right amount of coloring with the spinach and since I like a creamy Italian dish versus the tomato, the cheese added the right flavoring.   My partner had the chicken parmesan.   As mentioned, I'm not into tomato sauce except on rare occasions.   I thought it ho hum.   It was what I considered typical chicken parmesan.    Nothing I'd order.   I think it came with pasta.   Sorry.    I don't remember.    I just remember what I had and that I loved it!    We also had the calamari for appetizers.   It was nestled in a bed of arugula -- How do you like that word, \"nestled?\" -- and had a light lemon vinegarette sauce.   Not greasy, and since we like arugula, thought the combination was a good.   We made reservations and waited a tiny bit for our table.   I'd go back, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Took my wife to North Italia for her birthday and she really enjoyed it. We had the chef board for an appetizer and it was superb. We loved our meals as well and we finished are visit off with some tiramisu that was great. Everything about our visit was perfect. No complaints at all."}
{"text":"Interesting thing happened here. I'll start off by saying that I've wanted to try North for a while so shout out to Monica for making me get my butt in here. I also have to throw in that we both look absolutely smashing in purple.  So let's start with the good. North, like any Fox restaurant manages to pull off a fun, casual, lively atmosphere that is good for groups or a smaller crowd that likes to have fun. In keeping with the Italian Farmhouse motif, the inside has an open, almost converted barnyard feel with accents and decor that convey that farm fresh atmosphere.  You can count on a few modern twists to traditional Italian dishes from their appetizers and mains to their desserts. I appreciated having a choice of Peroni or Moretti. Their cocktail menu was interesting however the feedback from others was \"not impressed\" so I'm glad I stuck with a Moretti.  I started with a very respectable Caesar Salad. I am becoming more and more picky about my Caesars so theirs was as I said, respectable but not stellar. Our friendly server recommended the bolognese over the lasagna so I went with her confident recommendation.    Now this is my problem, not the restaurant's but I am one of those weirdos that likes capellini as my pasta of choice. I know, after nearly getting into an argument with a server at another restaurant (not a Fox restaurant), that a larger noodle renders more of the flavor of the sauce. This is why a bolognese is typically accompanied by linguini...fair enough. What I don't understand is this seemingly new trend where bolognese is now served with fettucini.   Long story short, this is how my bolognese was served and while it was good it didn't send me into endorphin-laden bliss like when I have some smooth-as-velvet capellini with my hearty bolognese. So it was good, not great and truth be told a bit of a let down. I know for the future to ask for capellini, so this is not the restaurant's fault.   What did blow me out of the water was their grilled asparagus. I am so glad I ordered this side. The asparagus was decent sized and grilled up perfectly. I knew I was going to regret it in the bathroom later on eating this much asparagus but it was so damned good. I can't believe I hated this stuff when I was a kid.  I took part of my dinner home to save room for dessert, which was vanilla gelato with expresso. Again, good but not stellar. But it's OK because we went to LGO for second dessert (like a good hobbit, I skipped elevensies)  So here is the interesting part. When I heated up my leftovers the next day for lunch, it was DELICIOUS!!!! Fettucini or no fettucini it was AWESOME. How often is your food better on the second day?  So to sum up, the best part of my meal was the company. North is definitely a fun place to go, but I would go more for the atmosphere less for the food and I don't think I'd go out of my way to come back here. But if I were invited for more food and fun, far be it for me to decline."}
{"text":"Happy hour is awesome here. The ambience is pretty nice too with plenty of light and a crisp freshness to the place. You can spend a couple of hours here relaxing, eating and drinking while chatting with friends.   The best thing during happy hour is the board which consists a variety of things from prosciutto to jam to bread at a lower price. That will fill you up. I also had the personal pizza special for the day. Couldn't finish it because of all the food. The vanilla vodka drink was decent.   So either the board or the pizza will decently fill you up. And probably a mimosa will top off a good experience. About $15 for that during happy hour. Although I didn't mention it yet... The food is really delicious. :)"}
{"text":"This is a little unfair to the service and food quality as dinner and drinks were wonderful. Service was superb and excellent food as always. I frequent all Sam Fox restaurants daily.  When I walked out to my car the valet parked it under the misters and it is filthy with hard water everywhere. Just had a car full detail this morning and is now ruined and need to go back to the detailer which costs more than my dinner. Valet needs to be a little smarter as this costs me more than my dinner;("}
{"text":"Service was excellent!! The bartender Mike provided good choices for me to try. Recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Good happy hour.  Spaghetti and meatballs for $5."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by and check out the new place Tuesday.  Complimentary valet is convenient if you get there early before the lot fills up.  I was impressed by the nice open design and high ceilings of the building.  I grabbed a seat at the bar and the server was super friendly and informative.  My pizza was on happy hour special that day and was only $8 which was a great value. I can't remember exactly what was on it other than chicken.  I also tried some of my friend's mafaldine pasta which was delicious with the rock shrimp.  This is a fun place bustling with energy."}
{"text":"We decided to go here on a whim one evening, best decision! The staff was kind, personable, and the food was amazing! We got the bruschetta, pesto pasta, and the piggy pizza. I do wish the portions were a bit larger for the price but other than that everything was great! I will definitely recommend this place to friends & family!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and thoughtful consideration of our young family"}
{"text":"Should've done this review right away, because i forgot what I ordered, but it was pizza and pasta and it was tasty and felt light considering what we were eating. It was very well prepared, the atmosphere was nice and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Was able to get seated quickly without a reservation. Atmosphere was light and it's always a good sign when you can hear laughter coming from every corner of the restaurant.  Food was outstanding. Hoping they add some Veg entrees but I found my way around the appetizer menu and was full by the end!! The Burrata was amazing!! Our waitress was super friendly as well.  Table was a little small though. With 4 people and multiple plates it was a balancing act to keep drinks from spilling off.  Agreed it was a little slow. The entire pace of the place was slow. Not painfully just moved at a slower pace. We were never neglected for attention though. So we were starving by the time our food came out (we were never offered bread for the table).  We will 100% be back."}
{"text":"Been here twice, both recently, both during the Summer Happy Hour offering.  And what a sweet deal it was!  Tell me when was the last time you scored a premium-ingredient Chef's board of meats and cheeses, and a not only palatable but darned good btl of wine, all for....ready......$20? Service was spot-on.  Only quirk was the valet parking service.  I think that my car must have been 1/4 mile away, it was very hot, and a sweat-pool graced my drivers seat. Uh....  But back to my \"dining experience\". North, even if it was only seasonal, you rocked it with this promo.  Great intro to your place, I will be back :)"}
{"text":"I am a little confused as to why my original review is no longer here? It was a positive review and nothing negative was said. Interesting... Nevertheless I have been to NoRTH numerous times and the food and drinks are always outstanding. I will say that sometimes you feel slightly rushed but for the most part it is still a great place to dine. They have renovated which makes the place seem bigger and albeit a little more dark. But that is not a bad thing as the food still taste fabulous.   Still scratching my head as to where my original review went. Oh well..."}
{"text":"Love it. A little noisy but great food and usually good service. Enjoy the meatballs and paperdelle bolenaise"}
{"text":"Always good service and the food is tasty. Drinks are likewise very good. They have gluten free items which is a plus. The atmosphere is festive and a mixture of families, date nights, and parties. It's one one of the better places in north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Amazing meal. Excellent service. Great outdoor bar while you're waiting for a table. The 25 minute wait went by like it was five minutes. Chicken Parmesan was amazing. As a tip take an Uber here because there's very little parking. But they do offer complimentary valet."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for lunch, happy hour, or dinner - it's consistently terrific.   Had lunch there last week with my daughter - I had the seasonal vegetable salad, she had the chicken parmigiana, and both were delicious.   Both of us indulged in dessert afterwards - she had the salted caramel pudding; I had some incredibly good vanilla ice cream with espresso poured over it... heavenly.    Not sure if the wine we drank with our lunch contributed to how much we enjoyed ourselves, but we did - thoroughly!  Great service, nice ambience, consistently delicious food - love this place!"}
{"text":"Everything at this restaurant was excellent, fresh, warm, crusty bread, grilled artichokes with a delicious aioli sauce. The salad was served on a bread board, italian salami on the bottom and layered with greens, veggies and a delicious light dressing.   The service was excellent, sat inside but they have a nice patio that looks out on the Kierland shops.   I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice dinner with my wife here. We both had the bruchetta appetizer and each had a bowl of pasta. Younger cliental. Good service and good food. I would go again."}
{"text":"Really good trendy Italian spot with some healthy options. Very cool ambiance and consistently very good food."}
{"text":"Love this place! The service is great the drinks are good and the food yummy and all at a very reasonable price. The patio is great for dining and they showed tonight they can do well with a large group. The scallops were a little over seasoned but well done you must have the beet salad!!"}
{"text":"First and foremost this one is very different from the North in Kierland.  Which I have decided I prefer actually.  A few of my friends and I decided it was amazing patio weather so we decided to sit outside at North. While the dirt floor outside patio is a nice idea it is messy. It has your shoes covered in dirt, not good for OCD girls with open toed expensive shoes.  We got the chef board as an app which had 2 cheeses, bread, thin sliced salami, peppers and some spiced nuts.  The salami was sliced super thin which was nice for a change and had a spicy kick.  I would definitely get it again.  We also asked our waitress (who was super nice) if they had a specials.  She recommended a sauvignon blanc wine which we decided to try, not knowing that it was $52 a bottle til we got the surprise on our receipt.  Our mistake, but I could hardly call that a special.  Best part was overhearing the guy get his burnt pizza delivered next to us a slice missing.  The waiter had been bumped, a slice fell down he brought that pizza missing slice and all to the customer saying that a new one was on its way."}
{"text":"We stayed in the area on vacation.   We took a chance as the yelp reviews (avg 3 1/2 stars) either loved or hated the place.  Bad music aimed aimed for a young crowd and I can imagine the place gets loud when it's full. Waiter & host were fine. Bathroom spotless. Happy hour sign advertised 1/2 price bottles of wine.   We had huge delicious salads - kale/arugala  and \"simple\" salad w/ roquefort & pine nuts, delicious roasted brussel sprouts and artichoke, and fantastic homemade pastas.  The bucatini spaghetti & meatballs were fantastic.   The sauce slightly sweet / slightly aromatic.  5 stars for the food."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets for Italian food. They make their pasta from scratch and you can taste the difference. Their chicken parmigiana is to die for! If it's good food you're after, you cannot go wrong. If you're looking for ambiance, I would probably go elsewhere. It can get quite crowded, and you sometimes feel like you're about an inch from sitting on your neighbor's lap. However, mid-afternoons are quite nice, between the lunch and dinner rushes. I have never had to wait for a table, nor have I ever had trouble with the service (as other reviewers are noting). When my husband and I go out to lunch or dinner, we almost exclusively come here because the food and service is excellent. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Decent. No wow factor.  My girlfriend received a $50 gift card for Christmas, so I checked the menu online and we went on a Thursday. Decently busy, but not packed. I rarely carry cash and was disappointed that we were FORCED to use valet.   We were greeted and seated warmly and quickly. No issues there. I did notice that the menu prices were around 20% higher than what was listed on their website, which was disappointing. But, eh.  The server was very good. She stated specials, and fielded pertinent questions. She was friendly, knowledgeable and prompt. No issues there.  What we chose for an appetizer was an entree special. While it was delicious, I couldn't imagine it as a stand alone entree. Two seared sea scallops over white beans and sauteed greens. But for $14 it was good.  The entrees were very tasty. My girlfriend had tortolloni  and I had strozzapreti on the servers recommendation. The dishes were very flavorful and portions were decent size. So again, no issues with the pasta, except after about 4 or 5 bites, there was a hair. Yay. I don't get overly wigged out about such things, but that was a major, major ding on the experience. I just hope the person washed their hair prior to work. LOL  For the most part it was decent. The food quality (other than the hair) is quite good. The atmosphere is very bistro, and slightly stuffy, though it's supposed to be more casual, IMO. The prices are out of line, but that's the case with all of Sam's concepts. And it's reminiscent of the Yard in terms of layout. Overplayed.  I admire Sam for his success, but I've been to almost all of his places and I'm just not that impressed. Others clearly are, but I'm not. Having been in the industry for 30 years myself, I've worked for a number of successful concepts, and mostly I think his stuff is overrated, and overpriced."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere and the décor of the place, along with the delicious food.  what knocked my stars down was the poor customer service. our server seemed to be having a miserable time serving us, not because my party was a nuisance, he simply seemed as if he didn't want to be there. it took him around 15 minutes to bring us our cocktails, and failed to refill our water while we were waiting. he did apologize for his lagging time though...  the small bowl of spinach tortellini I got was pretty tasty. the cheese melted in your mouth and the buttery flavor along with the spinach sealed the deal. delicious  mussels, and zucchini chips as well. Caesar salad, on the other hand, was ATROCIOUS. it literally seemed as if they bought a $2.50 bag of lettuce from Frys, grabbed a handful, spread it across the plate and threw some caeser dressing on it. it not only looked gross, but for a prices like that, I expected more, or at least a better presentation.  overall, its a super cute place to go on a date. the lighting is soft, the atmosphere is great but what  you pay for food and service is a little too much for what you get. not a bad place though, i would still recommend it to friends. I would just warn them to stay away from their salads."}
{"text":"Best happy hour!! Runs later than most- goes until 6! Super cheap bottles and small bites. Regular hour is great as well... everything my boyfriend and I had we ate every last bite. Will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale for five days for a conference and ate at North twice! Fantastic experience both times!! My first meal at North was for lunch where I got the seasonal vegetable salad. We also got zucca chips for the table. Both really delicious and perfect/ not too heavy for lunch. I also went to North for dinner during my trip where I indulged in some of North's heartier offerings. We got the arancini (best I've ever had, including in Italy), black Mediterranean mussels, the daily pizza which had Gorgonzola and arugula, bolognese pasta, and an affogato to finish the night. Everything was incredible and the service was fantastic. Super enjoyable experience both times!"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time last night and absolutely LOVED IT!  Seared Scallops with mushroom risotto: it was amazing! the scallops were perfectly caramelized and the mushroom risotto was soo creamy and delicious.  It also came with these crispy shallots on top which added another nice crunch to the dish. We came during happy hour so we ordered a bottle of wine which was half off! can't complain about that! even the bread they brought to your table came with a yummy flavored butter. Seriously don't have anything bad to say about this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place . We needed something like this in Vegas. Atmosphere was great , food delish , servers are awesome . Our server was nick , he is great very  welcoming and friendly . We had the chef broad , calamari and pizza . Everything was tasty . By the way I've been there twice this week . I just loved it"}
{"text":"Really inviting atmosphere. The white truffle garlic bread was pretty amazing. Our server Jennifer was upbeat and helpful in guiding us around the menu and wine list. Over all great experience. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Awesome atmosphere, great service and delicious food. We went with a big group and everyone loved their food. The fonduta appetizer was great, along with the funghi pizza, grilled chicken pasta and nutella dessert. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"North had a really great ambiance and served some quality Italian dishes. My girlfriend ordered the Bolognese pasta, which was quite good (and I'm not a huge pasta fan, so that always says something) and I ordered the fig & prosciutto pizza. I decided fig and pizza didn't quite go together for me, but overall the pizza was of pretty high quality. Not Bianco, Pomo or Cibo quality, so I would have liked it to be a smidge cheaper than what I would pay there. Service was average, but overall had a great atmosphere and some good quality Italian food."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places until they got a new chef who took my favorite burrata salad off the menu. When I requested it, my (not very helpful) server asked the chef about it. The chef agreed to make it, but said it would \"taste funny.\" Now why would I order something that the chef tells me will taste funny??? What a joke. I ordered another menu item and was not very impressed. They also used to have delicious fries that changed with the new chef. I'm not dying to go back."}
{"text":"Great time and atmosphere. Had a nice table on the patio. Our waiter Chris gave us some great recommendations. The scallops were absolutely divine! As were the braised short ribs. Don't miss the mussels. They came in this light creamy broth that was OMG-good when dipped with the toasted bread. Wow!"}
{"text":"Haley was a very good waitress who provided super service.   We dined outside and for 90% of the time it was smoke free  and very pleasant out and quiet."}
{"text":"I've been back to North several times since my last review... one 3 star experience and one 5 star experience which brings me back to my original rating: 4 stars!  My favorite items on the menu are their zucca chips, organic roasted veggies, and seafood.  At a business lunch recently, I enjoyed the ahi tuna salad while my companion enjoyed a caesar salad with shrimp.  Service was just right this last time (at lunch) but wasn't as fantastic as usual when I went for dinner with a group of 4 on a Tuesday night the last time I visited for dinner.  Conclusion:  North is pretty consistently a safe bet for a great meal, service, atmosphere, etc... and it's a great place to take a guest as they will get to enjoy the beautiful Kierland Commons before/after the meal!"}
{"text":"Sam Fox does it again!    I've been a somewhat regular patron of NoRTH Kierland and I'm also a fan of the NoRTH locations in Tucson and Denver, so I was really excited to find learn that the sixth location was being built just minutes from my house in Arcadia!  FRC did an amazing job transitioning this old car wash space into a gorgeous looking modern Italian Farmhouse.  It's spacious and and comfortable.  While I've only been for lunch, I will definitely return for dinner, and I hear they may be serving breakfast at this location too which I'd be down to try also.  While I'm not a fan of being forced to valet, at least it's free (although you've gotta factor in a tip). All of the staff from the valet to the hostess and waiters were exceptionally friendly, and as mentioned in other reviews, their \"uniforms\" are extremely cool.    But even more important is the food... and this menu is different than the others (although they do have some of my favorite old standbys like zucca chips and the insalate casa aka Caesar salad).  Some new favorites from my recent lunch are the salumeria panini (soppressata, salami, mortadella, roasted peppers, provolone) and the verdure pizze (brussel sprouts, butternut squash, caramelized onion, spiced hazelnuts, ricotta salata).  And if you're looking for a little snack or starter, I'm a huge fan of the crispy chickpeas.    Since this new location is conveniently located super close to my home, I can't wait to return to try some of their other menu items and some wine, beer, or cocktails from their very well stocked bar.  Happy hour, anyone?"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about the food, service,  ambiance and wine selection. We celebrated my birthday with a decadent dessert. Will return for lunch."}
{"text":"The short: Contemporary Italian fare (pasta, pizza, and various entrees) with prices to match; tasty but slightly pricey ten-dollar cocktails; service was fast and friendly; food came out quickly; ambience fit for an intimate, dress-nice date night, clean, well-lit, modern, and comfortable--think trendy barn and without the cruddy acoustic so many hip restaurants have these days.  The long: Located on a narrow lot on the east side of 40th St., just south of Camelback, tucked away a bit so it can be easy to miss, pull in and there will be free, fast, efficient, valet parking, and the valets aren't all scary if you don't tip because who walks around with dollars anymore? They get it, and they're great. As for the restaurant, like a Tardis, the place seems bigger on the inside than it does on the outside, so despite having lots of seats and a small parking lot, you don't necessarily feel cramped, though the servers have to be adept at maneuvering.   I made reservations (the site uses Open Table) just in case, which was super fast and easy, and met my friend for dinner. Service was quick and attentive without being obtrusive. It was a special dinner, so we went to town: shared zucca chips, arancini, I ordered short ribs, she had strozzapreti, and shared bombolini.   There's no graceful way to eat zucca chips. It's like the claw machine in arcades where you can fish around and try to win toys. They're too small and delicate to eat like regular chips unless you want to dainty your way through an hour of eating just that, so you just pick up a delicate ham-fistful, look up, open wide, and season your mouth. If you love fried zucchini, you might be disappointed--these are fried (and stay nice and crispy even as we continued snacking on them after our entrees), and they're zucchini (and taste like it), but they're barely substantial. They're tasty and salty, though, so at least worth a try. I liked the arancini better--moist, soft, fried rice balls? Yum. Take generous advantage of the marinara they're served on--that's where their flavor comes from.   My friend's strozzapreti (chicken, roasted mushroom, spinach, toasted pine nut, parmesan cream) was really good, cooked perfectly tender, tasty pasta and juicy chicken, and I tasted a lot of garlic mingling with the parmesan in the sauce even though the ingredient isn't featured in the dish's description. By a lot, I mean just right. I really liked my short rib, the meat itself being the highlight--soft, moist, flavorful--no complaints. I wanted polenta so I got I ordered the short rib as the main instead of with the pasta, but the polenta was a bit runny and added nothing to the dish; I couldn't get enough of a mouthful to find a flavor. I know polenta is often served soft, but if I think a spoon is a better eating utensil, then that's too soft. As usual, I was wishing for more veggies even though the carrots and onions were perfectly fine. I guess I think government-approved portions are the goal to aim for and I want half the plate to be produce.   Everything on the dessert menu looked enticing, but we split the bombolini, and I have nothing bad to say about fried dough that has a thin, crispy shell on the outside and is cooked all the way through. I think at one point, the restaurant filled the bombolini with custard, but now, they're just served on a bed of vanilla mascarpone custard sauce and Meyer lemon curd--a good counterbalance of soft and sweet and brightly puckery for summer.  I drank a Julietta, vanilla and ginger-infused Smirnoff, St. Germain, lime, and prosecco. It was such a well-rounded drink--I thoroughly enjoyed sipping it throughout dinner even though I easily could've chugged it down, it was so nice. The karma orchids they dress the drink with are edible, but I've never found them particularly tasty, so I let it just sit and be pretty in the empty glass."}
{"text":"Visited north for the first time last week for my 28th birthday dinner. I wasn't sure what to expect but I'm glad I chose this place.   The atmosphere and decor had a nice vibe and the staff is friendly. We went on a Sunday and found out that all bottles of wine were half off so we got the Riesling. I ordered the filet. It was very tender and juicy not to mention the assorted carrots were also amazing.   Overall I was pleased with my experience. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Services does take quite a while, I wouldn't go here if I was really hungry and looking to eat soon. But our server was genuinely kind and the restaurant set up is super cute"}
{"text":"We are in Arizona traveling and stopped at North around lunch time. It was busy, but they got us right in. Our server was nice and asked about our vacation.   I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and crispy potatoes. It was delicious and might have become my favorite food. I was brought the sandwich but they brought greens instead of the potatoes. I told the server who immediately brought out a side of potatoes with this weird delicious sauce that looked like mayonnaise. My partner ordered the pizza special that had corn, zucchini, arugula and other stuff on it. It was spicy but we were warned and was very good as well.  It was a little loud inside but like I said, it was busy. I would recommend this to anyone visiting. Also the prices were good for what you get. Definitely fresh quality ingredients."}
{"text":"I kind of feel bad giving this place only 1 star but I've given them many chances and 1 star is what they deserve.   The food is overall pretty good. Whoever the chef is, bravo. It's worlds better than the typical Italian slop in this area. However, the variety and selection are lacking. As for the service, if there were stars that went the other way, I would give it a -5. I've been here three times and have never had good service. As a matter of fact, the last time I was there we had to walk out leaving a big fat 0 on the tip line. I really hate doing that too but when you're ignored for 20 minutes when there's no one else in the place you deserve it.   This restaurant is also wayyyyyy too stuck up for its own good. I roll my eyes just thinking about it. None of the times I've been there has there been a decent crowd either. Maybe that should tell you something."}
{"text":"Great food, so-so service, cool environment.  The portions are not large so be prepared... order a ton of the bread & dip.  Pretty good Sangria.  Expensive and small portions but delicious."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! We went here with friends not knowing what to expect. The building and decor is modern yet very inviting. We were warmly greeted and escorted to our table immediately. The service was prompt and courteous, and the food was fantastic. The pizza was cooked just to our liking and the pasta was perfect and delicious. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Place is for real one of best spots in Scottsdale. It's true, service is awful but easily worth it for the food. To be fair, I have only had two different meals but the chicken parmesan is amazing.   It is seated in a beautiful district of shopping and retail stores but a little difficult to find for the first time."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the beautiful weather on the patio today for lunch and my first visit to North Italia! The restaurant is huge and beautiful with modern decor. Great wrap around patio with a bunch of greenery. Our server was Bobby and he was awesome. Helped explain the menu for our first time, gave the specials/soup of day right away, always kept our drinks full, and very friendly! Everything on the menu including their pasta is made to order and homemade so it's easy to make any substitutions.  Started with their black iced tea which was so tasty and refreshing! Complimentary bread on the table with oil and  balsamic was good as well. My mother in law got the salmon and veggies which she raved about how good it was. I got the burrata tortelloni which was AMAZING! My pasta was so fresh and flavorful. The burrata was creamy, pasta was soft, and the tomato sauce was fresh. I will definitely get this again!   We ended the meal with the Tiramisu which was served in a round glass jar, chocolate crunches on top, and perfect to share for 2. It was delicious and had a ton of flavor. Love that coffee flavor!   Overall very happy with the atmosphere, quality of fresh food, and the service here. Definitely going to come back and bring some friends! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I go back and forth on this place. Overall they are a consistently decent, I have to give them credit for that.  Nothing really stands out yet there isn't anything negative to say. They have some decent happy hour specials which is nice. I would suggest the meatballs, those are always good.  I can usually tell how the visit will go by how toasted/burnt the bread is when served with the meatballs."}
{"text":"I have eaten at North almost since it opened, which was so long ago I have forgotten when it was.  Many many times.  Their wonderful chopped salad has been deleted from the menu but they do have a fantastic seasonal vegetable salad which I ordered today for lunch.  There was almost no one in there at 1:30 when I arrived today for a late lunch, dying of thirst and starving to death.  Normally service there is pretty good as it is at all the Fox Restaurant group places, but today was truly awful.  It was so bad I actually wrote them a note on the receipt I signed and left my card.  I haven't gotten a call or an email.  The waitress finally came to my table and asked me what I wanted to drink, an iced tea, which finally came, but no bread. Their bread was piled up on the bar (their tomato butter is very good) but I never got any. This isn't the first time that's happened.  Maybe they were saving it for dinner people??  I ordered my seasonal vegetable salad with chicken and to start, their delicious Zucca chips.  (zucchini).  I have eaten them a million times.  Never came.  When they finally did, somebody else brought them I think, they were cold. The bowl was hot but not the food.  Obviously sitting on the warmer way too long.  Ate 2, pushed them aside, waiting for my waitress to come back to check on me, which she never did.  So still nothing to eat and it's almost 2:00.  Finally somebody brought my salad, which was delicious thank goodness because I was about to eat the table, and I finally got to ask for another batch of hot zucchini chips.  They finally came about 15 minutes later, well into my salad.  After that it was random people, all guys, coming to my table.  The waitress disappeared never to return.  The restaurant remember was almost empty.  Just a couple of tables with people and maybe a couple outside and staff huddled in conversation with each other in corners doing mostly nothing.  Several guys in the exposed kitchen working.  They seemed to be the only ones.  Why it took 25 minutes to make a salad that's probably already premixed I have no idea, and no one coming back to offer me more tea or even a glass of water and of course no bread and cold zucchini chips.  The bill was $26.  No discount for cold food or crappy, extremely slow service.  We've been eating here for years and I remember one awesome waiter who always remembered who we were because we ate there all the time but sadly he has gone for some time and has been replaced by an ever changing extremely young staff who seem to be unsupervised and inexperienced.  For a restaurant in a ritzy shopping center as this is, with a well known owner of other pricey restaurants, and this is quite expensive, service like this and lack of attention to the customers is a huge turnoff.  I have loved this place in spite of it's noisy and uncomfortable remodel last year or so, but I will think twice about coming again because it has become so inconsistent and downright unpleasant to eat here.  I prefer not to get my blood pressure up while trying to eat lunch and not die of thirst.  A glass of water should be de rigeuer wherever you dine in Arizona for Pete's sake.    I noticed they were quite prompt in bringing my check.  As I said,  I left a note written on the receipt i signed and my card, and have received no call or email since this afternoon.  Obviously nobody cares."}
{"text":"Boy, do I love this place. The salads are amazing, the Tuscon is my favorite.  The sangria is awesome, make sure you get it during HH because it's normally $30 and during HH is $15.    This place is great to take a few of your favorite friends and just BE.... Have fun, enjoy life, just be in the moment!  P.S. I forgot to mention it's a craft of sangria $30  not a glass... LoL...."}
{"text":"Absolutely the Best Italian I've had in Years and one of the best overall meals in my life!!!  While visiting Arizona, I stumbled upon North Italia. Luckily was there on a weekday during happy hour and took advantage of happy hour menu.  Ordered:  - Meatballs - Zucca Chips (Thinly sliced Zucchini that's deep fried) - Tomato bruschetta  - Pepperoni pizza - Chefs board - Parma Salad - Bolognese (Entree)  Also very important to note that Service was Great!  So damn good, I'm planning to eat there again tomorrow before heading to the airport."}
{"text":"I have been coming to North for years, the service and food have always been wonderful. North recently added a server named Rachel, she is spectacular. Her menu knowledge is impeccable as well as her table presence. I will keep coming back simply for Rachel's phenomenal service and over all bright and cheery attitude. If you dine at North be sure to ask for her! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I tend to be a bit picky about Italian food, because about 4 generations ago, my family was 100% Italian.  That being said, I am still impressed with this place's food.  It was certain good, but everything had a pro/con dichotomy (I'm just trying that word out for a bit).  Case in point:  Food was good, but it was an unusual pricing menu.  My partner got a margherita pizza, allegedly made from scratch, for a few dollars less than my spaghetti (no meatballs).  I couldn't understand why spaghetti cost more than making a pizza - a bit odd to me.  Point #2:  The atmosphere was really upbeat and fun, but we sweated like crazy.  The \"farmhouse\" atmosphere felt like just that - a farmhouse.  We were told they're trying the best they can, but it wasn't helping too much.  We were sweating during parts of the meal.  Overall, I think I would come back.  Since I recently gave up eating red meat, I think the spaghetti, although kind of pricey, is a force to be reckoned with.  I would just enjoy it more in a better climate-controlled environment."}
{"text":"Our first visit to North Italia was on Father's Day and it was busy! Wow! We had reservations for 6:15 and our table was ready on time.  There were so many people there and it was absolutely filled with families enjoying their dinners.  Our server took our drink order quickly and appetizers, heirloom tomatoes and cucumbers and grilled artichokes were delicious.  No bread though.  They did take a minute and the manager came by too apologize.    We were with my husband's parents and together managed to order the same thing, Bolognese for the ladies and chicken parmigiana for the gentlemen.  The waiter suggested ricotta for the bolognese and said he'd bring a little out for us to try.  I ordered a side of meatballs as well for my husband to try.    It was taking a bit of time and the manager again came and apologized for the wait.  The food came out shortly thereafter sans meatballs but they were brought out quickly when we asked for them.  Three smallish meatballs.  They were really good though.  The bolognese was very good and needed nothing.  It's cooked with sausage as well so if you're not used to that, it might bother but I thought it was very good.  The ricotta addition gave it a lasagna component.  The chicken parmigiana was amazing! The chicken coating was nice and crispy and the chicken moist and tasty.  The pasta combined with the chicken was the perfect bite.    We really enjoyed ourselves and were happy with everything we ordered.  We just wish there was some sort of bread to sop up the remaining sauce from the bolognese."}
{"text":"Really great open atmosphere and fantastic food. Happy hour is pretty solid too. Try the chicken parmigiana, super tasty"}
{"text":"Not a good place for Vegan options. Barely anything and even if they manage to make something it's just OK.  Still giving 3 stars because my friends and colleagues like it."}
{"text":"We dropped in on North Italia upon staying at the Westin at Kierland. Greeted by a friendly staff and seated in the back dining space (area overlooking the Kierland Commons) as we requested to have a tv view to watch baseball.  We were seated in the same space as a larger group hosting a business dinner. Our server was prompt, answered all our questions, and kept drinks and bread bowl full.  We ordered our dinner and the larger group next to us began a presentation and orchestra of speeches. Our server immediately asked if we would like to relocate and we respectfully declined as not to make difficulties. Within minutes it became awkward to dine and enjoy our evening, we asked to be moved and immediately had 4 staff members who where profusely apologizing (which was not their fault). All four of our meals were amazing, don't hesitate to order the Short-rib Radiatori!! So the hook to this review: we were overly pleased with our service & food, though at the end of our meal the manager brought over a gift certificate to the neighboring ice cream shop as she overheard our kids' excitement in dessert as compensation for needing to move tables. Applauds to North Italia, well done!"}
{"text":"This  was our first visit after reading great reviews and hearing from Friends that this was a great, new hot spot. Our first impression after giving our name for a table was that the hostess and host were completely frazzled and disorganized. They were expecting a party (that arrived an hour after us) and holding some Patio tables, but we were still able to get seated fairly easily. The heat warmers were on, making it very comfortable for the  table outside. Once our server arrived, he explained the menu and 1/2 priced bottle Of wines, a special offer on Sunday afternoons. We ordered the roasted cauliflower, meatballs, margarita pizza and a kids pepperoni pizza. Everything was tasty and service was good. We'll definitely go back for the 1/2 priced wines and I'd like to try an entree next time. Overall very great of experience."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND   North has a number of locations in Arizona and Texas.  I just had dinner at the Kierland location in North Scottsdale.  Kierland is a beautiful mall and North is very pretty. (see pics)   There is an impressive bar, two dining rooms and a cozy patio that is heated for comfortable outside dining in the winter.  THE MENU   The menu includes appetizers/small plates, salads, pastas & mains. (see pics)  Appetizers:  Zucca Chips Braised Meatballs Calamari Bruschetta Grilled Cauliflower  Black Mediterranean Muscles Truffle Garlic Bread  Grilled Artichoke  Chef's Board   Pastas:  Spaghetti & Meatballs Chicken Pesto Cheese Tortellini Bolognese  Strozzapreti Squid Ink Malafoine (which I had) Ricotta Gnocchi   Mains:  Grilled Brazino Short Ribs Diver Scallops Chicken Parmesan Roasted Chicken NY Strip Atlantic Salamon  Desserts:  Bombolini Olive Oil Cake Dark Chocolate Tart Tiramisu Affogati Gelato Salted Caramel Budino  SERVICE EXPERIENCE   My only complaint is the hosting staff.   Although I made reservations and there were plenty of tables available, I had to ask several times to be seated. There were 3-4 different hosts and no one was able to figure it out.   CONCLUSION   Unfortunately, all the effort to make a great environment and fantastic menu ALWAYS gets over shadowed by poor service and thus the 4 stars instead of 5.  4/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE   *Parking is limited. Parking garage is near by.   *Hours: Lunch: 11am - 4pm Dinner: 4pm - 9:30pm/10:30 Fri/Sat Happy Hour: 3pm - 6pm  *For more information: NorthItaliaRestaurant.com"}
{"text":"The location is ideal and the ambiance is even more than expected! Cool how the place is separated by two buildings . We were seated in the bar north which was just as nice ! The pizzas were like no other. The wine list is comparable and most of all the zuca chips and the bread were great appetizers."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good food!  Great service!  Love the ambience and decor.  A simple modern take on Italian making everything fresh in house and it's just delicious!"}
{"text":"This was the place to be on Friday night...packed to the gills and the food was best I've had in awhile. We had the garlic truffle bread which is served in a small cast iron skillet, the diver scallops on a bed of lemon risotto with butternut squash and the house bolognese which was load with a ton of meat with good fennel flavor. Lastly we ordered the affogatto with salted caramel, the salted caramel bundino, and a jump start"}
{"text":"We heard the reviews.  Did not disappoint.. one of the new restaurants in our neighborhood... ..great ambiance.. bit busy on a Thursday.. so service  slightly slow. ..nonetheless  it was great experience.  Great food.. pasta freshly made. You can see behind the counter how it's  made. squind ink malfadine was too die for.. . Strozzapetti was delish too.  For app we had arancini and calamari.  Different take on calamari seems like it has balsamic reduction but it was lemon vinaigrette  which is good. Arancini .. gotta say had better.. lack mozzarella.. one I'm  used to My friends had pizzas.. they were good too..burrata appetizer was awesome!  For dessert.. the tart and hazelnut torta are my fave.  Tiramisu is different  but good. Bombolini with lemon sauce.. i dont care for..but that's  just me .. too tart... will come back and try their other dishes"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with delicious Italian food!  Our party of 9 was seated in an additional room in the back of the main area which was perfect since we had kids and wanted a bit of privacy.  We shared a few of their items:  *Marguerita pizza- soft crust, cheesy, yummy *Meatballs and arancini- good for sharing *Squid ink pasta: was interesting with a spicy red sauce *Bolognese pasta: very yummy, you can taste it was homemade *Calamari: breaded perfectly and very tasty *Seasonal vegetables: healthy and delicious way to complement our meal. It had kale, farro, quinoa, and a sweet light dressing. *Tiramisu: served in a cup and topped with crunchy little chocolate balls, SO good!  Service was great. Restaurant is modern, inside a beautiful mall. So recommended!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy!!! Amazing home made pasta! We ordered 4 different pasta dishes and lovvveed everyone - we will definitely be back! The meat and cheese app to start was also great!"}
{"text":"Food and service excellent.  However, very noisy inside.  Will try the outside terrace next time.  I would also like to see them have happy hour on Fridays."}
{"text":"Great spot, a little noisy early on s Friday night. Meatball App was fantastic, calamari, I've had better. Caesar salad was superb, tiramisu had small coco balls on top. Very different but tasty. Bread was very good as was the Bolognese."}
{"text":"Met up with some fellow yelpers on a Wednesday night for the International Supper Club UYE, this time we headed off to North Fattoria Italiana .  I have to say I have driven by many times and thought, wow I love the look of this place, the huge windows are so inviting! So when this place was picked I was pretty excited!  I got there a little bit early which was ok; it allowed me to really take this place in.  I absolutely love the opened kitchen. The entire place has this opened feel to it, rustic yet modern at the same time.  Visually impressive.  Some of us meet up for Happy Hour, but quickly found out that happy hour ended at 6, so I rushed my order in at 8 mins till. I had a glass of the house white wine, it was very pleasant!    After everyone arrived it was time to order! I surveyed the menu over and over, but kept going back to the Pesto dish. I love Pesto! It's one of my favorite dishes, also something that isn't cooked often in my house, so I took this opportunity and ordered it. The pesto was fresh, the noodles perfectly cooked and fresh! Love homemade noodles! I was very pleased with my meal!  Everyone's dishes looked amazing too!  Glad to have tried North Fattoria Italiana and look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Food is pretty good. I've been there for lunch and dinner. Maybe would go back. Didn't love anything enough to crave it b"}
{"text":"OK.  Loved this place!  Decor, food, and service!  Started with the tomato bruschetta (house made ricotta, campari tomato, basil, & tomato jam).  It was good.  Then the server suggested the SHORT RIB RADIATORI (parmesan cream, fresh horseradish, wilted arugula, and herbed breadcrumb).  This is one of my favie pasta dish EVER!  The short rib was so flavor and just melts in your mouth.  The past looks like radiator... (hint the name of the dish).  LOL!!!  To top off the night, I got the DARK CHOCOLATE TART (nutella mousse, pecan toffee).  Talk about a foodgasm...  OH YEAH!"}
{"text":"We had a good time and food quality is on point. However, our dining experience diminished with service quality. Our server placed our entire order (appetizers and entry) all at the same time which resulted in all our food coming out at once. Literally, three servers all handing us food. Temp on the chicken parm was too hot burning the top our palates. We also ordered a bottle of good wine which was warm so it indicated the bottle wasn't stored properly. As I mentioned this could be a 4star restaurant with proper management."}
{"text":"Great flavorful Italian, modern look restaurant, the food would make me come back.  We had prosciutto bruschetta for an appetizer, chicken parmesan (wow) and bolognese (delicious). Entrees run about 18-22 - service was attentive.  To be honest I was worried about coming to a restaurant that only opened a week ago. I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I've been a regular since they opened last December. Not only is the food amazing but the staff is stunning. Most of the time my waiter's name is Amos and he is just fabulous. He takes care of us as if we are family and recommend nice dishes that we always love. My favorite entree is the squid ink mafaldine that consist of pasta made with black squid ink and seafood. Just delicious ! Today for a change I had the calamari with arugula and I was once again not disappointed at all. Thank you Amos for the nice recommendation. Will be back again soon !"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I'm so excited to write this review because I'm so happy there is an amazing hip Italian place in Vegas. We came last night around 6 for dinner, and it was super lively inside. They have a beautiful outdoor patio seating that takes up nearly half the restaurant, and the whole restaurant itself is open air. I would describe this place as elegant and rustic.   We got the Garlic Truffle Bread w/Ricotta Appetizer and omg this was so good. The bread is well coated in olive oil, retained the crunchiness and softness of the french loaf, and was bursting in flavor. The homemade ricotta cheese with it was a really nice touch and added a coolness to the bread.   For our main course, we got the Squid Ink Madaldine. I honestly wasn't wowed by this dish for the fact that the pasta itself was too al dente for my liking and the pasta flavor was overpowered by the mint leaves. The spicy tomato sauce itself was really delicious, but I think it needed more of it.   We also got the Funghi Pizza, and WOW this pizza is legitimately so delicious I kept commenting throughout dinner how yummy this pizza was. The crust is really nice, but the star of the dish were the perfectly cooked roasted mushrooms in the olive oil and mozzarella. It really tasted as though truffle oil was used, and I'm a huge truffle fan. So pretty much, you need to get this pizza.   For Dessert, we got the Tiramisu. It was so fresh and yummy, and actually comes in a pretty large portion (enough for 2). I really liked the crunchiness of the chocolate balls on top, adding some nice texture.   The service here was also top notch. I was greeted by the GM and checked on multiple times throughout dinner. I'm in love with North Italia."}
{"text":"Great new spot in summerlin! Great ambience! Food was delicious! Calamari is excellent and the bolognese was fantastic! Red Sangria.....not my fav"}
{"text":"Tried this place on their second night of business and it was absolutely delicious. Enjoyed the traditional salad and the strozzapreti pasta - both wonderful. You can taste the freshness I love when a pasta has pine nuts and they actually put a lot of pine nuts in it. The service was excellent, our bartender Tacie was so knowledgeable and friendly. Even though the restaurant was busy, she was very focused on us. We inquired about brunch and she went and got us a menu and pointed out her favorite menu items. Can't wait to come back and try out more items."}
{"text":"Had a great time at this place.  Wonderful food!  I had the artichoke appetizer with truffle oil.  My main dish was a fig and prosciutto pizza which was awesome.  Three champagnes, an appetizer and two main dishes for $70.  Great deal!!! Aaron was our server."}
{"text":"Another very solid Fox Concepts Restarant.  Definitely should be in the rotation of very good dinner spots"}
{"text":"This place has a nice twist on Italian.  The atmosphere is great its wide open.  You can see everything in the kitchen from meats being cut to things being cooked, there should be an Food Network focus show done here!  The lighting is wonderful, I even picked up some interior design ideas.  The food was extremely tasty, a little on the salty side,  but it probably was the pruiscuitto.   The wait staff is extremely friendly and there is complementary valet.  North, I've made a new friend, I'm excited to get to know you and your menu in the future and develop a tasty culinary relationship.  FYI-this is a great date place.  It will delight your date as its not trite."}
{"text":"This place is really popping for being so new. I suggest making a reservation because there will be a wait if you just show up. But the bar is open seating outside and inside. The cheese board and cauliflower are great apps. The seasonal salad probably one of the best salads I've ever had. Second time I went I got spazztetti (sp?) pasta. Very good!!! I'd get it again. And enough to take leftovers home! Fun atmosphere restaurant bar style. Heaters outside."}
{"text":"The best for the best. Treat yourself to a wonderful dinning experience at North Italia."}
{"text":"3.5 stars if I could. Took a flier on North since the 7:30 Saturday night line at Chelsea's Kitchen was immense. We were able to get seated right away. Lovely place, especially on a cool November evening with everything opened up. Patio was nice, service was prompt & attentive and friendly. Wife was starving and they were able to quickly get our fried chickpeas out to us. Nice choice of craft beers. My tagliatelle bolognese was solid, but no more than that. Her Funghi pizza was, too. Best part of the meal -- donuts/profiteroles with lemon curd and mascarpone. Oh yes. All in all, good, but not great."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth checking out. The service was excellent despite it being super busy - complimentary valet parking, friendly hostess, attentive waitress. The atmosphere is great, very bright and modern. And, most importantly, the food was out of this world. I split the prosciutto brushetta with my boyfriend - super fresh ingredients. For my meal I ordered the seasonal vegetable salad with salmon and I couldn't get over how perfect it was. All the ingredients complimented each other and the salmon was cooked just right (not dry like at a lot of restaurants). My boyfriend got the pizza of the day which was great tasting and also a good deal (only $8!)."}
{"text":"pleasantly surprised with this place. first time to eat here and yes we finally have a go to place for Italia food in Summerlin."}
{"text":"It's a pleasant new hot spot in Summerlin. Definitely will be back there again. Service and food choices are amazing and out/in bar set up is fun. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"Last Saturday my friend and I said, what else is there to do on a Saturday afternoon except eat, drink and hang out.  We definitely went to the right place to do this.  The new NoRTH in Arcadia, Sam Fox's latest creation, met our every need.  I started off with a Stray Dog to drink.  I'm not sure what was in it but it looked pretty and tasted good so I guess that's all that matters.  My friend tasted it and ordered that as her second drink since it was so good.   For an appetizer, we ordered the bread & cheese.  I had no idea what to expect because it said it came with tomato jam.  What is tomato jam?  I'm still not sure I know, but I know I would go back to specifically order this.  The garlic bread came with warm, melted Italian cheese, almost like fondue, in a little skillet.  The bread with the cheese and the tomato jam was the perfect bite...Mmmm.   Next we ordered a pizza to split.  Verdure was the name of it.  It was topped with brussels sprouts, butternut squash, caramelized onions, hazelnuts and ricotta salata.  Need I say more?  Delish!  My friend and I even told the valet guy on our way out to make sure he tried the pizza with the butternut squash.  Next we split a pasta which was a recommendation from our waiter.  (Obviously...how could someone not recommend this).  This was definitely my favorite.  The Agnolotti (definitely homemade!)  was filled with ricotta, mascarpone, pecorino, grana padano and topped with herb butter.  The sauce was so light that it allowed you to eat every single bite, and we both did, without being too rich.  I don't usually eat pasta, but I will definitely be eating this again soon.  It really was so delectable.  Next we split the Scottish salmon salad.  How come I would never think to put marcona almonds and figs in my salmon salad with white balsamic?  It was so tasty and flavorful.  The food being served at tables near us definitely kept catching my eye.  Everything looked so unique and appetizing.  Besides the food, the atmosphere was also very fun and chill.  We were just enjoying our afternoon hanging out and eating amazing food.  Oh wait, I forgot my second drink.  I got the Red Rooster which was like a fancy version of a Bloody Mary.  It came with a little skewer of a caprese on it - really it came with little tomatoes and mozzarella on top of it.  So awesome!  We also ordered affogato for dessert but I was too full to eat it.  My friend said it was orgasmic.  Guess that explains that.  All of the waiters were very attentive.  Service is not always good at a new restaurant, although here it was exceptional.  It was fun to check out (no pun intended) all their different plaid and checked shirts too.  Boring uniforms at a Fox Restaurant...never.  I even told my friend and one of our waiters that this is the best Fox Restaurant yet.  I don't live as close to this restaurant as a lot of other Fox Restaurants, but I will definitely be back and cannot wait to try more yummy food."}
{"text":"Poor service. Waited for our food for 45 minutes. Food wasn't that good. Bolognese is they're specialty but don't bother to order, it was bland and just wasn't good overall. The manager was short and rude. I simply asked as to why other table got their food first and instead of easing an angry customer, he had to argue that 2 people get their good first vs 4 people but keep in mind we were sat way longer than those couple. Their menu price also does not reflect the same price in the receipt. Didn't want to argue about a few dollars and just paid for it. Will not come back. Will not recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Had a yummy dinner at North Italia.  Started with their Sangria (offered at cocktail hour:-), and dined on their SQUID INK MAFALDINE - white shrimp, calamari, acqua pazza, mint, fennel pollen, calabrian chili.  It was quite delicious.  Didn't notice any warning on the menu to let me know it was nice and spicy!  Good thing I'm ok with it, because if I wasn't so spice friendly I might have been put off by the heat.  The waiter didn't mention it either upon ordering, but no issue here. Just a little extra wine to mellow my mouth, haha!  Nice patio seating, a little tight, but pleasant in the nice cool winter season."}
{"text":"Good italian food. Pizza was delicious, but squid ink pasta was disappointing. Everything else was great!"}
{"text":"Took some guests in from out of town and it was so LOUD that we got up from our table and went to Bar North to dine outside....same menu, but not quite what we had hoped to experience.  Tiny round tables to dine...just because the employees may like loud music, let's not forget who pays the bill!   I ordered brussels sprouts and they arrived and they weren't even trimmed up....an oversight I hope."}
{"text":"We ordered chicken parmesan. It was terrible. The dish was bland and flat. The noodles on the side were mush.  We started with a beet salad, split. They were about three bites each. The coffee came out half empty. When they made more it it was weak and watery.  The tomato butter they serve with the bread is terrible but I guess that's okay as the bread is stale.  The restaurant was crowded. It was 81 degree that day. They have an open kitchen with huge fires burning like mad and didn't turn on the Air. It must have been 85 degrees inside. The outside is a disaster, no decor. I can only go there when the amnesia sets in. They also try to take you to 'the annex' a crap shell across the way from the garbage cans and the bathrooms. Your food gets to be carried with no tray right by the custodians emptying the trash cans....And the maintenance workers with their filthy mops. When you make a reservation they don't tell you they are going to stick you in the annex,Their failed coffee shop with no atmosphere."}
{"text":"the doughnuts on the dessert menu are SO good. Pizza is greasy, but happy our prices are great"}
{"text":"Stellar service and experience! I ordered the Burrata Tortelloni and my girl got the Eggplant Pizza. Both were fresh and delicious! We finished with the Salted Caramel Budino and Hazelnut Torta for desert. So good... Thank you to our server Brenda and manager Gabe for taking care of us and making sure our first visit was rad"}
{"text":"We went on Sunday night around 5:30. Usually I would make a reservation, but we didn't plan on going there. Still only had a 20 minute wait. We sat under the outdoor heaters and it was lovely. We always get the chefs board and the grilled artichokes. They are so good. This time we had the funghi pizza. Everything was delicious. But what made our meal this time, was our fabulous server Hailey. As a server myself, she was exactly what I know my customers love. She was friendly, knowledgeable, and just made it a perfect meal. We will be back and we will be requesting her as our server!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  The bruschetta was tasty but the pasta was average.  Nice decor but I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Hands down favorite restaurant! MUST try the muscles and scallops!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Don't take my word for it! Been here twice and everything I've tried has been amazing. Calimare is the best I have had!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter 's first Mothers Day and she made the reservations. Great start was valet parking young man but then the Hostess says to my daughter can you be done in an hour because we have a reservation in a hour. We had a reservation?? I kept my daughter from ripping her a new ??? Can't blame her! Anyway most of the staff was great and the food was fine but half the tables were empty when left??"}
{"text":"This place is SO cute. Friendly and very helpful staff. The food was OUTSTANDING.   Try the bolognese and the tiramisu."}
{"text":"I recently hosted a private party here for 65 people.  I would highly recommend this venue if you need a space for a large group.  I was very impressed with the service, the staff and the food.  They did an amazing job making sure we were very well taken care of the whole evening.  They offered a menu of many items that would please even the pickiest of eaters.  The meatball sliders were to die for as well as the tiramisu...yummy!   Thanks everyone at Bar North for a splendid evening!!!"}
{"text":"Was invited by friends to this new Italian fare eatery. Was pleasantly surprised with the food. Seemingly simple dishes prepared with attention to detail. The place was packed. I went back again without a res only to find a 45 min wait. Place was packed. Great sign. Lively bar scene with TVs to watch sports. Casual local hangout that has the current attention of the west side. Recommend"}
{"text":"This evening we were celebrating my brother-in-law's BD. Cynthia was our waitress. She was so attentive with our needs. I had brought a birthday cake to celebrate my brother-in-law BD. Without been reminded to Cynthia she brought the cake out with candles. How cool is that. We all thank her for her service. North Italia has been our friends and family favorite restaurant since it opened late last year."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Thursday night with a group of 5. Made reservations and were seated right away when we arrived. I didn't really know what to expect, but I was more than pleased! We ordered a caesar salad, pasta bolognese, and pizza (sausage and spicy salami, i believe) to share and WOW - everything was super fresh and homemade. The sauces were delicious and the pizza was 6 slices of goodness. One member of our group is gluten free and ordered the GF pasta -- he said it was really delicious. We also got a bottle of wine that was super reasonable and everyone agreed it tasted great for the price.  Beware: this restaurant is LOUD! We had a tough time talking to each other -- it was more like yelling! But the yummy food more than makes up for the loud atmosphere. Go!"}
{"text":"After dining here 5ish times and getting courier delivery another 5ish times I am upping my rating on this restaurant to 5 stars.  Some dishes are a miss...but stick with the short rib, mussels, Cesar salad and even pizza and you are going to enjoy your dinner.  I am extremely particular about my service...this place does not disappoint.  I don't make reservations...ever...anywhere...worldwide...and normally I am taken care of...I have had to walk out a few times because they were busy and either didn't notice me or didn't care...losing my business (even for an evening) is a costly error...my proclivities...are how shall we say...economically stimulating."}
{"text":"We made a reservation day of for six of us. We arrived and were promptly seated in a corner. However, we waited for a waiter for over 15 minutes. We were staring down other servers hoping that SOMEONE would come to us. Finally, we approached the hostess and told her.   The manager ushered over someone to us right away where he took our drink orders. The manager also hooked us up with some free appetizers. This greatly made up for it, and we proceeded to enjoy ourselves.   I got the spaghetti with meatballs and I substituted angel hair pasta. Yum yum!! I was in Arizona for four days and this was probably the best place I ate at. It was an interesting find, and I'm glad we found it.   Kudos to the manager for looking out for their patrons!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the new NORTH in Arcadia. The waitress Madison was very helpful and knowledgeable. The atmosphere was lively and fun! The only thing I had a problem with is that when you asked for bread, they said there was a charge for this.  I didn't think that should be the case....otherwise I would give it an A-."}
{"text":"This is a place with very refined food in a very modern and open setting. The food is elegant and very good, and the ambiance is more casual. It is quite noisy here, so you will have to speak up. Now, the food. The truffle bread was very cheesy and decadent, without overdoing it on the truffles, which some restaurants seem to have a hard time with. My entrée was the squid ink pasta, which I got because I wanted to see what squid ink tasted like. It, surprisingly, had earthy notes instead of a sea flavor. There was also squid in the pasta, gave it a good combination of flavors. Make sure to get dessert, as the donuts are light and delicious."}
{"text":"Marie and Tacie..omg they are amazing.. what a fun night with my amazing friend Nicole celebrating her bday!!. We Will come back for the food but continue to come back for the servers and their service.. thank you ladies for an amazing night!!"}
{"text":"this place is amazing! I wish I could rate 20/5 stars. Came in for happy hour and as soon as I stepped in I immediately loved the ambiance. The interior reminded me of a restaurant that could have been in Seattle, was very clean, modern, and comfortable.  To eat I got the Chef's board (apricot marmalade is so tasty), Prosciutto bruschetta and Bolognese pasta. Everything was amazing from start to finish. Definitely recommend giving this place to visit.   Didn't get the full name of my server but her initials were TC - flawless service, she was very informative of each item we ordered and was welcoming."}
{"text":"Good food and amazing service. We chose to try the appetizers, the calamari was exceptional, the flat bread bbq chicken pizza were excellent. The Resturant had a welcoming feel and s nice energy. The drinks were good and prized well."}
{"text":"I'm familiar with the North located in Kierland, so the food was amazing as usual. This location was by far my favorite. It looks small from the street and has a nice sign at the front, but the restaurant itself is wide open and large. The decor is wonderful.  We sat outside on the patio per our reservation request and the patio was beautiful. It was a nice night. The lights were pretty and you could see the street but they put enough foliage that you weren't listening or seeing too much of the traffic.  Our waitress was very friendly and checked on us often. The food was perfect and we were left extremely happy."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch here the other day. There was no wait and our server was great. We decided to sit on the patio because the weather was beautiful. I started off with the green tea which was tasty and we shared the chopped chicken salad and the pig pizza. Portions were light but it was enough to fill the both of us. The food was really good and I enjoyed every bite. The only downside is  that I think prices are a little high. For a salad, a small pizza and two drinks came to around $40."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a colleague recently.  After browsing the menu, decided to go for the Baked Ziti (Bolognese, Spinach, Ricotta, Mozzarella Cheese, $16) and a glass of 2007 Frog's Leap Zinfandel, $12.50.  The weather was awesome, so we dined outside on the patio.  Our server was awesome and made sure our glasses of Wine were never empty.  The food came out pretty fast.  I took one bite of my Ziti and instantly became a fan!  The Bolognese Sauce had the right combination of Spinach & Ricotta to make a heavenly dish....the proportions of ingredients was just right so that any one flavor didn't overpower the meal.  It went great with the glass of Zin.....which had a nice Chocolate-Berry flavor with a slight Peppery bite to it....yum!  Overall, it was really good dinner.  Can't wait to come back and take The Better Half.  Return Factor - 95%"}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday afternoon for brunch. Unfortunately, the patio was closed for a private event, but we were able to dine inside. It wasn't busy which is nice. They offer valet parking so make sure you have a couple of bucks to tip the valet guy.  I love North in the day - the restaurant is so open and bright. Our waitress was nice and we decided to place our order: short rib hash, a side of lemon donuts and bacon. They actually split the short rib hash for us since we told our waitress we were sharing.   The short rib hash and bacon was savory, and the lemon donut was the perfect amount of tart and sweet. Our order was perfect for the both of us and our bill came to a little over $20."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of North in Scottsdale, so I decided to drop by this North with a colleague after work....it's the same owners, so it should be the same, right?  WRONG!!    This place is totally different from the Scottsdale location.  The menu is different, the vibe is different.  What a weird experience....but it was good.  The food is very good, I had the Spinach Tortelloni....yum!  I washed it down with a glass of Vino.  Their Wine selection is decent, I had the Super Tuscan.  Service is good, but the parking is tough....parking is always challenging in this area, especially when it's busy.  Overall, it was a good experience.  Return Factor - 75%"}
{"text":"Really good food. Recommended my teenage daughter go there for a special occasion. She loved the ambiance and the food was really good. Although there was a random incident where she requested a refill for her Dr Pepper and a waiter (that wasn't the waiter she had all night) dropped off this half empty (or full, which ever way you want to look at it) drink, with no ice and a reddish color to it! Super shady and random. She was kind of uncomfortable after this and left. I hope this was an isolated incident!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! The service was great and it was matched by exceptional food! We brought our 2yo and 7mo with us and it was a great environment. We had the Egg and bacon pizza. Which was heavenly. Great balance of flavors and very filling. My wife had the Strozzapreti and it was rich and more than plenty for one person. We also ordered the kids spaghetti and meatballs...WOW, we left with at least two portions of leftovers and the homemade pasta was great! This will be a go to place going forward for us!"}
{"text":"Went on July 4th for lunch expecting to be quiet...complete opposite. Place was crazy with people. Ryan was our server and quite knowledgeable. Suggested a few items and all that was ordered was superb. The service we received from Ryan was outstanding, our drinks were constantly refilled w/o us ever asking and he checked on us throughout our entire meal. if he is working on the day you are there, ask for him as your server you won't regret it.....zucca chips outstanding!"}
{"text":"My partner and I dropped by this place on the way to the cinema and caught the happy hour for a charcuterie board, some pizza and wine and we were SO impressed! The variety was great, the prices for Happy Hour were amazing and the all around vibe was so relaxing. We were outside where the atmosphere was so pretty and felt so authentic with cute inside/outside bar, fireplace and mosaic tile. Although there were quite a few tables outside, you still felt like you had your own privacy and the service was also incredible with any questions I had about the menu being well explained."}
{"text":"Whatever Sam Fox touches turns to gold. Another great fox concept. Came here with two friends and we split pizza, apps, and some cocktails. Everything we had was fantastic and our server absolutely blew us away with service and wine/food knowledge. This is a must go to on any occasion. I really like the wine list you will see some big names at a reasonable price and some unknowns as well."}
{"text":"I loved the look of this restaurant and would recommend it if you just wanna have a glass of wine and good drinks as for the food I was not impressed. I tried the zucca chips since they were all the rave and I felt like I was eating fish food. The meatballs are pretty good though. It's just not a place I would go to again if I want something great to eat."}
{"text":"It was my 1st visit and love the atmosphere.  The food was delicious!  Had the farmer's market salad and very tasty.  My friend had the pasta and he really enjoyed it.  I also tried the sangria and did not care for it.  I have had better, lucky for me is was only 4 bucks.  The server was very attentive, almost too attentive, she was starting to get on our nerves.  She kept interrupting our conversation.  Anyhow, we did try their hazelnut chocolate cake and that was very delicious.  All in all, it was good experience, the food was great, service was a tad too much and my sangria disappointed me."}
{"text":"Sitting on the patio with our infant son, enjoyed prosecco and perfect funghi pizza on one of our few date nights. Eavesdropping on an interesting conversation on the next table over. Staff went above and beyond throughout. The night was perfect. One of the best Arcadia dinners we've had."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a group of friends. Really busy and trendy spot located in the same plaza as Honey Salt. We started at the bar with drinks while waiting on a table.   I ordered the Julietta, which was a sweet and refreshing martini. My friend ordered the cucumber martini. The presentation on both were nice and they were crafted very well.   We ordered the following appetizers:  Roasted cauliflower-served in a hot skillet. Was crispy and had really good flavor. The fried egg was a nice compliment to the roasted veggies.   Meatballs-served in a hot skillet with a side of garlic bread. Good flavor and a good table share plate.   Caesar salad-fresh and flavorful   White truffle garlic bread-good plate to share for the table. One of our favorites. Crispy and soft bread topped with fresh ricotta cheese.   We each ordered an entree and they were all really good. Nice size portions and good flavor. We had some leftovers.   Chicken Parmesan-crispy and flavorful. Served with a side of pasta with cream sauce.   Chicken pesto pasta-another favorite. Pasta tossed with pesto sauce and topped with grilled chicken and pine nuts. Really tasty.   Squid ink pasta-flavorful and had a bit of a spicy kick   Short rib pasta-sliced short rib on cream pasta served with arugula. Short rib was tasty and tender.   Scallops-served medium which was perfect. Really good flavor and texture.   All in all we really liked this restaurant. The food and service were great. Good place for date night or groups. We will return."}
{"text":"Just had the most amazing meal. We had a special invite for a decadent, fantastic and most of all delicious meal courtesy of North Italia in Summerlin tonight. Diver scallops tender and moist. Short ribs were torn apart and flavorful. Polenta yummy. Calamari and arugula was crunchy and spicy. Arachini balls were crunch and rice was cheesy deliciousness. Desserts were to die for. Share one at least.  Thank you Jennifer, our attentive server. Special personality and graciousness about her. Ryan enjoy your trips around Vegas for special findings and German for the hazelnut toffee. We ate like ballers and that's a fact Jack. Omg... no food for the next two days. Lol"}
{"text":"North is my favorite spot for a relaxed dinner. Make sure to try the Julietta!"}
{"text":"The food is quite excellent as is the service. The decor is very clean and modern."}
{"text":"Horrible food poisoning from pizza of all things for my son and I. Why in this day and age in an upscale establishment is this allowed happen. I'm over 2 days suffering on vacation because of someone with filthy hands or something to that effect.   Nothing else consumed the same day could be attributable. Symptoms onset was pretty soon after dinner."}
{"text":"Decent cocktail and wine menu but like most of the stiffs in this place, they are trying a little too hard.  Just the fact that some idiot took a picture of an exotic sports car in the parking lot says it all (pic #11).  They try to have the neighborhood vibe and to be inviting but none of my neighbors want to pay $18 for a plate of average pasta.    Don't wear a plaid shirt with jeans or else people will look at you like you're part of the waitstaff."}
{"text":"By far the best Italian restaurant I've tried hands down!! Wonderful customer service and unbelievably delicious food! Ryan at the bar was so helpful with educating us on recommendations as well as accommodating exceptional hospitality. Try the White Truffle Garlic Bread, its the best garlic bread especially with the ricotta cheese!!"}
{"text":"This review is based off my one experience with their to-go process. I am a little disappointed. Ordered margarita pizza and tiramisu to pick up. The woman on the phone told me to pick up in 15-20 minutes. I arrived about 20 min later. I then had to wait almost 20 minutes at the bar for them to bring my food out. It turns it my pizza must have been just sitting there, because it was totally cold. I'm sure it would have been good fresh, but the food I was served was definitely not. Like I said, I have never eaten in, but their to go process is definitely dysfunctional. This was 5 pm on a Sunday, they should have been more efficient, especially being a Fox restaurant."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! North has the best gluten free pasta and pizza I have ever had! Also, their wine list is incredible. From the complimentary valet, atmosphere, great service, and amazing food, North has become me and my husband's favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"We went here for my sisters birthday. The food was about average, I didn't really feel like it was super special. I think we had a trainee as he literally brought out each and individual drink separately. We were a large party so this probably wasn't the best time to let him go it alone."}
{"text":"My wife had been wanting to try this place so we went for an early Mother's Day dinner with our young daughter.  We made a reservation and were seated within a few minutes of arriving.  The hostess was very nice and gave us a couple recommendations as we were being seated.  The place is a little loud but nothing new for Vegas restaurants and the decor is pretty cool.  We ordered our appetizer and drinks first and took a little time deciding on the main course.  After we ordered our main course it seemed like everything went into warp speed.  Our appetizer came out about 30 seconds before our main courses which we did not appreciate.  Our waitress would disappear for long stretches at a time.  I was never asked if I wanted another beer or if my wife wanted another drink and our waters were refilled once at the at the beginning of the meal and they went empty after that.  The next time the waitress came by she started picking up plates that still had food on them that we were still eating and we had to tell her to stop and put them back.  Talk about feeling rushed to get us out of there on a night where we just wanted to relax and enjoy a little family time.  The unfortunate thing is that we did enjoy the food, I had spaghetti and meatballs, the wife had pesto pasta and my daughter had a kids pizza, but the poor service and the feeling of being rushed put a damper on the night.  Its pretty bad when you feel like the server could care less about your dining experience at their restaurant and just wanted to turn the table.  As I said earlier we did like the food but it will be a while before we go back again if we do, too many other places to go with much much better service and dining experience.  It is very unfortunate because we did like the food and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came out this past weekend.  It was my husband and my first time at North Italia and we loved it.  We weren't starving, so we ordered a drink (both were delicious!).  We ordered the zucca chips and the calamari salad appetizer.  The salad was excellent, the chips weren't bad, but it seemed like the majority were overcooked/borderline burnt.  The bacon & egg pizza we split was scrumptious.  We opted for dessert and ordered their Salted Caramel dessert and the gelato of the day (pistachio).  I didn't like the salted caramel dessert, but my husband LOVED it and ate the whole thing, I enjoyed the gelato, but didn't think it was the best I had ever had, or really even top 5 for that matter.  Will definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"NoRTH is my new favorite go to spot for lunch and dinner.  The atmosphere is wonderful -- country themed, open, fresh and clean.  I have travelled throughout Italy several times and have found NoRTH's food to be the closest thing to being there.  They have captured the flavors so well.  They have super friendly staff that are engaging and welcoming.  Only down side that I have experienced is the valet.  One time the valet left and instead of locating me in the restaurant, he left my key sitting on the corner of the bar.  This is not acceptable to me.  If you only have valet parking available, make sure they are servicing your customers they way you insist your wait staff service your customers.  Don't let that stop you from going though.  Your palet will be please you went."}
{"text":"I don't like writing negative reviews. Especially when I go somewhere on a holiday like today. Places are packed, and servers are normally stressed. I let A LOT slide. But this was different.  1. We made a reservation for 1pm days in advance. We were told that would not be a problem. I got there at 1 and we were seated at 130. Even if it's a holiday, you need to make sure those that have called ahead are seated promptly.   2. Our server, Matt B. was, for lack of a better term, aloof. I truly felt from him that by simply being there, ordering food, and asking that our checks be split (4 ways w/7 guests), we were truly a burden to him. He at one point walked around our table looking at our drinks (I assume, otherwise I have no clue why he would walk around the table silent), saw I had an empty glass, and then proceeded to walk away. I at that point had to ask for a refill (I'm not above asking, but I thought he was looking, and it certainly wasn't busy). He said \"ok\" and came back and filled it up. Look, if it was busy (where we were, it wasnt), and he looked frazzled I would not be writing this. He was calm, relaxed, and just DID NOT CARE.   3. The food also was nothing to write home about, and I usually LOVE Fox concepts restaurants.  The pizza was, pizza. Good, not great. The zucca chips were once again, good but not great.   All in all, everyone at the table agreed that this was one of the worst service experiences they've had. I don't intend to come back, and the 6 others in my party agreed that they won't return either. Sorry North, I really had high hopes here."}
{"text":"Ok...My experiences at Sam Fox restaurants have covered the spectrum, but today, North really delivered.   The dishes and the execution were 100% on point.  I started with the seasonal vegetable salad; Beets, Carrots, Radishes, Kale, Romaine, Dried Fruit, Farro, Marcona Almonds, Pecorino, and White Balsamic Dressing.  One of the best salads I have had in a long time....great flavor and texture combinations....and perfectly dressed.  The Burger and The Spaghetti and Meatballs were also home runs.  I would dare say, Best Spaghetti in town.  High quality thick pasta prepared perfectly al dente with a little chewiness, and a lusciously rich perfectly balanced tomato sauce with herbs and parmesan.  It was phenomenal.   The burger was also fantastic...great bun, and flavorful toppings.  The crispy potatoes  are wonderfully prepared...get them!!!!  I would like to thank whomever created and executed these dishes in the kitchen at North for a lunch that surpassed my expectations."}
{"text":"Peg and I typically veer away (read run) when a restaurant is part of a chain. In spite of this being part of the Foxian empire, we were drawn to this place because of the wonderful Luis Millan,  His culinary chops are well documented and he could not have been a more gracious presence to our first visit here.The arancini and a chef's board of of sliced meats and cheese (with a wonderful apricot mostardo) began the meal and whetted the appetite. I had the heirloom beet salad and Peg the seasonal vegetable salad...the freshness permeated the dishes and the wonderful textural notes were wonderful. Moving to the mains, the chicken and prosciutto and spicy shrimp pasta dishes were wonderfully flavorful and not over spiced. A layered nutella, banana, dark chocolate, and hazelnut/plum combination  dessert was very satisfying. Our server was Kim.  The face of the house and the conduit to a wonderful experience is always the wait staff IMO...and she is superb. She is vigilant without hovering, and making sure all was well. I would strongly suggest that you try this place...but if your schedule permits...try the place as close to opening (4:00 pm) on a Saturday as you can make it.  We arrived at 4:30ish...and by 6 the place was almost booked. The atmosphere was wonderful, and in the relative quiet of the earlier hour..you can appreciate the commitment that this place has for its decor and customers.  Chain or no, individuals make the experience...and this experience was delightful.  Dr, B"}
{"text":"Had the grilled asparagus, heirloom tomato something, and zucca chips with a couple sangrias.   ...amazing! Everything was great and our server Logan was fantastic."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere. The service was great. The beef filet was so tender and delicious. The tiramisu was out of this world. There is a drink called the quiet Italian gentleman and it's the best. I like the outside inside setting. Great location. A homerun."}
{"text":"I work nearby but never have a chance to stop by. Tonight my bestie and I decided to have a girls night and since we were at Kierland anyway we decided to give it a try. It didn't disappoint! Vanessa, our server, was an absolute delight. Our food was delicious and our drinks strong. Will definitely be making my way back!"}
{"text":"Excusing the pretentious capitalization of this restaurant, I must say my meal was perfect. Went with family, had the salmon. Cooked to perfection and was accompanied by some sort of risotto like pasta with crack cocaine butter on it. I plowed the whole thing down like there was no tomorrow. And that was after their delicious house bread and special butter. Good stuff, this place."}
{"text":"Yummy fig and goat cheese pizza omg omg omg nom nom nom. Oh, also the service and atmosphere is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Happy hour Is the best time to get a great deal! $20 for an 8 slice pizza and bottle of wine! They're sangria is amazing and definitely worth a try (usually I do not like sangria but theirs was amazing) love love love north italia!"}
{"text":"Have been to this place twice already once for lunch and once for brunch. It was amazing both times!!! The food comes out piping hot!!! Chicken parm was delicious, the breakfast sandwich was tasty, nothing beats their truffle oil bread with ricotta butter!!! So yummy. The waitresses were consistent and friendly! Would def recommend for a great lunch or dinner date!"}
{"text":"Food was great and service with a smile. They took excellent care of my 8 month old granddaughter"}
{"text":"I chose this place for lunch on a recent trip to Kierland being that I scored a parking spot right in front! WooHoo!  First of all they had a VERY unprofessional and inexperienced snot-nosed (literally) Hostess working that day.  We almost decided not to stay because of the way we were treated ( spoken to demeaningly, rude, abrupt and carelessly seated) by the Hostess.    The manager happened to notice our distress and promptly moved us inside to a table that accommodated our party size, Unfortunately we were not offered anything complimentary for our trouble :(  We got  a Great Waiter!   Ice Tea is Delicious,Refreshing and never got empty, the fresh baked bread and roasted red pepper whipped butter was out of this world!  We started with the Fresh Mozzarella,Local Tomato, Sweet Basil and Aged balsamic salad caprese style......DELICIOUS!  I ordered the Flattened chicken sandwich with saute' spinach and smoked provolone on  a fresh baked ciabatta bagel bun...YUM my only complaint is that the chicken had too much a of a bitter charred flavor.  Choice of side was pasta salad or veggies, I chose the pasta salad and was disappointed in it's flavorless mayo like coating.  2 of my Guests ordered the Angus burger with fresh mozzarella and crisp pancetta, both said it was scrumptious.  1 guest ordered the \"Not Your Typical\" chicken lasagna..... This meal was Sad, Lasagna should have never been in the same sentence, it was a bowl of stir-fried chicken ,spinach, mushrooms and broth covered with a big square noodle. Should have been called \"Not your Typical\" chicken soup.  It tasted OK (i tried it) but OH so NOT what we were expecting I wouldn't recommend it.  I noticed the table next to me ordered another pasta dish that was the exact same ingredients as our faux lasagna except it had corkscrew noodles mixed through out.....that's lame......2 of the same dishes labeled differently.  Tiramisu for dessert was spot on! Very light and creamy!"}
{"text":"Tried the new NoRTH this Sunday in Arcadia and we sat outside and loved the atmosphere!  The fondue bread appetizer was awesome and to die for! I could have eaten the whole thing myself! We shared the Italian Salad and the beet salad and both were delicious. We also shared the beef short rib gnocchi and the rock shrimp pasta and both were great. Save room for the Italian donuts in cheese cream sauce. Extremely decadent!  Great place! I would go back and sit at the bar if I were by myself. The bar is nice and opens inside to the outside just like Hawaii!"}
{"text":"First time I went I liked it a whole lot better than the second. They put salami in almost all their dishes which is sort of odd. I recommend the rice balls and pizza but do not recommend the bolognese. I'll come here for pizza but if want Italian food I'm going to Mastrionis"}
{"text":"Food = Delicious! Primary reason for my 4-stars.  Service = hit or miss depending on how busy they are (I would give service a 3-star)  Price = reasonable with larger portions and the quality is great  Happy hour? = Excellent! You get a steal with this place and it's offered Monday thru Thursday from 3-6 pm   Highly recommend reservations especially on weekends and Friday's. I use OpenTable to get the points!   There are indoor and outdoor seating. Each time I come here, it's at night so I prefer to sit outside on the patio because inside it's too loud. The bar has a great selection of wines, beers, and well drinks.   I will definitely come back here again. However, I won't be back when it's busy because the service becomes sub-par when they are too busy.   My favorite things to order are:   The garlic bread: crispy bread loaded with garlic and cheese! Nom nom nom  Short rib pasta: huge portion so it's a great dish to share  Any of the pizzas: North Italia knows how to make amazing, fluffy dough topped with quality ingredients for all their pizza's. Comes with about 8 slices so it's a great dish to share as well.  Tiramisu: YUMMM. Comes with little chocolate wafer balls so you get a nice crunch.   Overall, 4-stars.   Happy Dining,  JT"}
{"text":"We have been to this place twice while we were in Phoenix. Awesome! Friendly prompt seating . Waiting was friendly. We got the magherita pizza and split the Bolognese pasta. All we're great. My one suggestion would be to have wider ribbon pasta noodles. Overall love this place."}
{"text":"NoRTH seems to be just yet another overated Fox restaurant.  We went away somewhat disappointed after reading all the positive reviews from fellow Yelpers.  Here's my breakdown -  1. Space - the restaurant has a somewhat cool vibe, but the space is too open.  There's nothing that really breaks the room up, so you just feel like you're in a big room of tables.  Not bad, just not super compelling.      2. Menu - pretty good set of options.  Seemed like a strong start here.  3. Food - this is where things started to slip.  A good indication of the quality of an Italian restaurant is it's bread.  This wasn't the good stuff - it was the light tasteless unnoticeable bread that every medium Italian restaurant serves.  Ours was dry, maybe because it was later in the evening.  The food was all beautifully presented, but lacked great flavor.  I'm a big fan of burata but theirs was entirely flavorless.  Salads were overdrenched in dressing, though the ideas were good.    3. Service - our waitress seemed very well-intentioned and nice, but paid us very little attention.  Asked for olive oil with the bread instead of the standard butter - oops, missed this.  Asked if we wanted more appetizer olives - then forgot to bring them.  Seemed to approach the table at awkward times, but then was nowhere to be found when trying to pay.  Not super impressive.    Bottomline: This restaurant is kinda mediocre.  It's hard to really go beneath 3 stars, because it's nice and moderately well executed, but it's far from inspiring or even a solid recommend to friends.  Options might be few up here in North Glendale, which is the only reason I can think for why others rate it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Overall, solid Italian restaurant. I spent about 3 years overseas in Italia (North Italia, north of Venice) so I first opted for the Friulano wine--pleasantly good wine. The selection of wine was awesome too and most were from Italia.  We then got the Chef's board, and it was amazing; this was about as traditional Italia as you can get. For dinner, I got the grilled Branzino and my wife got \"the Pig\" pizza. Overall, my fish was 4/5.. the setup was good but the fish was charred just a tad too long that left a slight burnt taste which impacted overall flavor and left it dry. For the price, I would've definitely got something else next time--My wife's pizza was supremely amazing--again, comparable to what you'd actually get in Italia.   Finally, my only real critique was that our waitress was not present most of the night for us; either she was assigned too many tables or was inefficient/new at handling the workload. Delayed refills and getting our food out in a timely manner.   Overall though, nothing major and I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to try a new and authentic Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"The tortellini with mushroom sauce is amazing. The cheese has an extra flavor( surprise!!) encased in handmade daily pasta. The sauce was hearty and lighter than it looked.  During Happy Hour they offer a pie or cheese/meat block with a bottle of wine for $20. That's what got the extra star. When a place this good offer affordable specials that is perfecto. Did you see that it came with a BOTTLE?!?"}
{"text":"Love this place. Their \"pig\" pizza is very delicious. Red sangria is not your usual sangria, a very tasty one. Finally, I had their hazelnut torta. If you love Nutella, salted caramel gelato... you'll love it.  Overall, it's a great place. Shout out to Rob, an awesome waiter."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delicious cocktails and yummy food. I loved the Julietta cocktail, the zucca chips, and the pizza with the egg on it. The beet salad was lovely as well. Everything seems fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Menu was nothing spectacular - pasta dishes were okay, but nothing to write home about. Prosciutto wrapped chicken was pretty good and their bread is addictive. The overall quality of the meal versus the high prices was not worth it."}
{"text":"Lovely cocktails and pasta . its a nice place . service is excellent Really love the decor and outdoor seating. It is very convenient as i live nearby.food is amazing"}
{"text":"We came in an hour before close for the first time we were here. The place was empty so we were able to take in the large and airy splendor of the building. We split a margarita pizza and an appetizer which were both delicious.  The next time we came in it was Christmas Eve so the entire place was reserved until 8pm, except for the patio and the bar. We chose to sit on the patio, which was thankfully well heated and had a beautiful fire going in a large outdoor fire place.   We both tried different pastas this time, I got the strozzapreti and him the chicken parmesan. Both were incredible despite the chill air outside and the squalling baby at the next table. All their pastas are made fresh daily and their ingredients are clearly very fresh.   Since then we've tried a few other things, including the chicken pesto, the Bolognese, and the zucchini chips. All of which were just as incredible as the first time we came in.   The serving sizes are large and leave plenty to take home, their drink selection is vast and they have a full bar, the only thing we havent tried yet is their deserts (we just can't ever seem to leave room for it!). The location is large but gets packed quickly so make reservations, there's also a vallet so parking isn't difficult. Authentic and delicious Italian food in the heart of Arcadia, perfect for large groups, date night, or impressing your coworkers!"}
{"text":"The best Italian restaurant in town by far. Weekly dinners here, and it's amazing!!! Try everything."}
{"text":"This is a very nice restaurant. The open kitchen concept's very cute. You can see them working on your pasta, cutting fresh prosciutto and they have all this freshly baked bread on display (make sure you buy a loaf to go- We did it and had some pesto mozzarella sandwiches at home... Delicious!).  The food's really good and I believe it's priced accordingly to its quality. We were there for brunch on Sunday and everyone enjoyed their meal. We were a big group also so we got to try all kinds of different food but their pizza seems to be the queen (or at least for our table it was!).  Make sure you bring some cash to tip the valet parking guys. There's no parking on the street but their valet parking's free (you just tip and that's it). I'm not a fan of valet parking myself but I understand some people like the convenience/feeling spoiled by having someone else bring your car for you to the door, specially when eating at a nice place like this.  It's a cute place for a date or an anniversary or just because. The food's delicious so just go anytime!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites, particularly for brunch.   My favorite thing to get is the bacon and egg pizza with a ginger vanilla greyhound to drink. If you're looking for something small to munch on, the zucca chips are good. The lemon donuts are also a delicious treat!   I haven't tried the pasta, but I have seen them make it fresh.   One of my favorite things about this place is the atmosphere. The decorations inside almost give it a modern, trendy barn feeling. It can get pretty loud inside when they're busy though.   They take reservations, which is nice, especially if you have a larger party dining there.   They also have a bike rack out front for those nearby who would like to bike there. It is right off the canal.   They have complimentary valet parking as space is limited. There is really nowhere that you can self-park. There is a large lot across the street for a strip of stores but signs state you can't park there if you are attending North. So just be aware of that. There are a couple spots for 15 minute parking for those who are picking up orders."}
{"text":"Went there for first time last night with my girlfriend and the last!! Went in and the hostess was rude, not even a hello or nothing, no smile! Just an attitude of just not wanting to be there, gave her my name and said the wait would be 30 which was no problem! After about 5 min, I thought this is not good! This was bad and thought it just might get worse!! First impressions are important but i guess not here!!! Will never return!!!"}
{"text":"Interesting Italian food. Very nice space and attentive service. Pizza crust very thin and crispy. Pasta looked good but portions a bit small and no bread to sop up gravy. Ceasar salad had excellent croutons but authentically had anchovy in it."}
{"text":"Literally everything on the menu is delicious, and the happy hours can't be beat. My favorites are the mussels and the charcuterie board. Sangria has brandy in it... yummm. Bartenders are super knowledgeable and nice. Service can be a bit slow but only because they're always busy."}
{"text":"From taking our reservation, and allowing us to change it till later, to the complimentary valet retrieving our car at the end of our meal, service and attention to detail was outstanding. And the food! We started with the chef's board of meats and cheeses, and loved every crumb. The server told us they prepared everything from scratch, and it tasted like it. For entrees we had the bolognese pasta, gluten free, and the storpretezzi pasta, also gluten free. Both were so flavorful and rich, we couldn't finish them and had them for lunch the next day. Because it was my wife's birthday they gave us a dessert of sorbet, and made us feel special. We will be going there again, and again!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants within the Fox Restaurant Group.  However, after last nights experience it left with me with confusion. It was a Friday night and myself and boyfriend walked in, assuming there would be a wait- no worries! The hostess told us it would be 40 minutes. I said, great and we found ourselves enjoying a drink at the bar. 1 hour later we checked in with the host and they said there was only one person ahead of us. No worries, we will wait a few more minutes. 15 minutes went by, and then close to 25 minutes rolled around. We had waited for nearly 1 hour and 15 minutes. We were disappointed to say the least. We checked in one more time and they still had no table for us. We reluctantly just sat at the bar instead of waiting (who knows how much longer) for a table, which we preferred. Normally, I don't have an issue with waiting for a table, but during our long wait time, there were at least 3 tables of 2 available for at least 45 minutes. Because we have been here many times before and know that the food is delicious, we stayed and ate. However, if I was a new customer I would have left and found food elsewhere. I hope this review gets seen by management, as this experience did not sit well with me and I have experienced much better in my many visits before."}
{"text":"To say I was disappointed with my meal and service quality at North Italia is a vast understatement. This past Saturday a friend and myself decided to call in an order and take it to go since her husband was still at home and it's about 30-35 minutes away, we just happened to be over that way.   We order on the phone and they repeat it back to me and everything sounds great, they say it'll be 25 minutes and we head over to pick it up. Once we get there they confirm our order again and give us the receipt to sign and all seems good. We ordered two different pasta dishes, the scallops, and the bread appetizer. We leave and get back to the house, again, 30-35 minutes away and the appetizer and two pastas are on top with the scallops on the bottom. Everyone's food looks ok, then I get to the scallops. I asked for no butternut squash and to sub for asparagus, which the receipt said again that it was subbed. Upon opening the container, the risotto part of the dish was missing entirely from our order, so right there half the meal is missing. They still put the butternut squash in as well, and the Brussels sprouts weren't actually Brussels sprouts, just the ends that when cooking you usually discard because they're too fibrous to chew through (I included a picture of the Brussels sprout ends, which were the only thing included).   So, basically I got to pay for a full entree to only get 3 scallops and a few asparagus and nothing else to eat. I called them to see if they could potentially put me on a list or something to have the entree remade at a later time, because again, I'm 30+ minutes away and driving back would be ridiculous. I didn't want a refund and I wouldn't even have written this review if something like that was done but they just apologized and asked if I could drive back to get the missing component of my meal.   Based on their reviews and people saying everything was good I was excited to try this place and upset that my experience wasn't the same. Just prepare to be disappointed if you order to go.   **UPDATE: The manager messaged me wanting to make it right and I tried to reply but the email he gave me wasn't valid and he never replied to my message so I guess my review stands since I won't be giving it a second chance due to the flaky communication"}
{"text":"Happy Hour: Monday - Thursday 3PM-6PM.  Scientific research and data analysis tells us that writing Yelp reviews is getting pricier and pricier.  In fact, the most commonly reviewed places every year are restaurants.  So with that, an expert foodie like myself and others who have at least 10 reviews and 10 pictures posted, would suggest taking advantage of Happy Hours around town!    Welcome North Italia's Happy Hour!  I love you for your $20 Bottle & Board [(italics) choose one: pizza, bruschetta, or chef's board & (bold) a bottle of the red or white].  BUT I've been here about about 4 times now, the first visit Carrot Top was there, second visit was with the parentals, third and fourth being Happy Hour.    The one dish I always order is the truffle garlic bread (it's not a Happy Menu item); it's so damn good.  Just know it's enough for 4 people.  The homemade ricotta cheese that accompanies the garlic bread just slays this dish.  It was a subtle drop but let me say again that this $20 happy hour item comes with a bottle of house white or red wine!  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Like other reviewers, the consistency of tasty food (esp the home made pasta!) keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"So I am super conflicted about this place.  The service is excellent, you get free valet parking.  The decor is great, open kitchen, and just a great ambiance.  Then you have excellent tasting food. But my personal issue is that the food tastes are not my type of food, most of the foods have a more sour type taste like vinegar and lemon.  You can tell it's great food though.  I did not try the pizza but it looked really good.  I was just too full from everything else.  Here are the things I had (we had 17 people and they treated us really well).  Calamari - with lemons, but it's a lemon sauce not fried lemons like they seem to suggest, I didn't like it cuz of the lemons but it would have been great otherwise  Nutella Triffle - I normally don't do dessert but since it was my birthday I did.  This thing is great!  Three layers of chocolate, nutella and graham crackers. with hazel nuts on top. Yum!  Scallops and Risotto, well cooked scallops with a good risotto, a bit thinner than I prefer my risotto but I like it thicker than it normally comes.  Tortellini  with Spinach, this thing was really good, nice dense tortellini and greatly cooked spinach.  All in all, I'd come back and try the pizzas next time, but if you are into pasta with a zing of lemon, this place is great!"}
{"text":"We always come here for authentic Italian cuisine. The food was great, and vegetarian friendly. The service was on spot as well. My favorite dishes were     the chefs pizza and the chicken parmesean."}
{"text":"I had a large party of 30 people here, and everyone was so impressed with the food and the service! Alix, the district manager, and David, the restaurant's event coordinator, helped me to plan the menu and make it perfect. When I realized that one of my guests was vegan just a few minutes before the event started, David helped me to organize an entree for my vegan guest from Flower Child (owned by the same company) at no charge. It was so nice to have all the help that David and our servers (Bonnie and one young man who was very helpful) provided. We'll definitely be coming back for more parties!"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite before the music at Kierland. If we didn't chose to eat outside the not so busy place was on a 45 min wait?!?! Whatever outside wasn't that bad with misters. The Dr. Pepper I ordered my 4 year old came out a diet coke. Even he knew the difference and refused to drink it so I asked for a Chocolate Milk instead. Then we were charged for the Dr.Pepper we NEVER got and a kids drink was supposed to come with his meal! He got the Crispy Chicken which was a lot of food and good. Not your typical kids chicken fingers. Unfortunately my 4 year old doesn't like rosemary so he would barely eat it. The fries were large and saturated with grease. Our Pitcher of Sangria was so full of ice it would have been cheaper to order it by the glass! When we went to fill our cups back up the second time the ice was overflowing out of the small glass onto the table and the tiny amount of liquid was left at the bottom. No bread was brought to start we had to ask for it while we ate because the bread they supply to soak up the juice of the mussels was hard like a crouton. The Mussels were alright but tasted like bitter burnt garlic (in fact we found large amounts of burnt garlic in it). We ended up leaving after our appetizer since the service and food was so bad."}
{"text":"I have been going to North for 10 years. It once was a cool,layed back place with great service and food. The bartenders knew their regulars and there were a lot. Sorry Sam Fox. No longer true. It is so hot in there and the service is awful.. I asked if I could sample 2 wines. I was given a dime size of wine each time. I settled on Conte Fini Pino Grigio. A safe no brainer. Bartender opened the bottle then sat it down at the bar gave us 2 empty glasses, then left. She didn't even pour 1 glass. And the wine was warm. The pizza of the day was cheese and sausage. I asked if I could get it with out sausage but with a little basil on top. No I was told. It would cost a dollar. Ok I said. The pizza was like cardboard with crust. It used to be great. What happened? It was crowded so I guess they don't care."}
{"text":"I just had the worst and most unprofessional experience I've ever had at North. I would suggest any other restaurant in place of North. I have been a customer for 7 years and will never go back.   Management was weak, service was terrible and most employees have bad attitudes making for a less than pleasant experience. You can either have a \" good experience\" or a \" bad experience \"....... Mine was the single worst experience I've had in a restaurant.  Actually all Fox restaurants are very similar. Make sure to avoid the these restaurants as there are so many much better places to go.  I know the owners and look forward to telling them to their face. This restaurant is a NO GO.....  For single guys DO NOT socialize.....this is not the place to go.i  As with the other reviews North has gone South!  When senior management is fired my friends and I might consider going back but I doubt it."}
{"text":"Great service and great food!  I have eaten here about six times now, I love their beet salad, pasta and as close to Italian authentic pizza as you can get!  Staff are really kind, and you can watch the cooks working their butts off.  Thanks to the chef and the cooks, and the staff at the bar are really nice too!  It is really busy, so make reservations!"}
{"text":"Lunch today must say \"From: -ambiance (un Arizonian) open uncluttered indoors w outdoor seating decorated and warmed today by a wall hearth. - staff-lots of native young energetic quietly, efficient- not trying to converse you away from great food.  -Menu w no fan fare straightforward and clear presented in a -non-intimidating manner.  NOW the cuisine-worthy of 5 stars! As a quintessence foodie (eat out 60% time) I found the cuisine delicate, artisan plates truly reminiscent for me of Italian countryside meals. - Wine list unique not all  'fresh vintage's older than 2010 & 2009. I enjoyed a 2007 Piedmont red by the glass  All of the above PLUS reasonable prices-so important- so we can go often, looking forward to revisiting for dinner  then for the brunch."}
{"text":"I went here with some work colleagues.  I felt like I ordered the wrong thing and I had a bit of food envy.  So, I'd like to try it again.  The service was excellent and they have a decent wine selection.  I had the \"Not your average chicken Lasagna\" and it was unremarkable.  In fact, it was tood soupy.    I also had some Kale as a side.  I know kale is sort of a tough veggie.  But, I really had to chew the heck out of the stuff!  The deserts were good.  However, the crepes were a little tough too.  We had a goat cheese and fig pizza apetizer and it was very good.  Like I said, I'd like to try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"We came here with a large group and i feel like the restaurant catered to the size of our group very well! We ordered the appetizer pizza, 5 different pasta dishes, and a couple of the \"meat and veggie\" plates.   The tastes in every pasta dish were great! good flavors and quality ingredients. The espresso drink was a nice ending to the meal."}
{"text":"I love this place! The people are nice and the food is great. I personally love the sangria, it's the best I've had. Mainly because the fruit is grinded into the drink, making it a little pulpy. The kale salad and calamari are great, and my coworkers really enjoyed the pizzas. I would definitely come back here again. It gets pretty packed though which would be the only downfall, but that's how you know it's good! Wish they had one in SoCal!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! The atmosphere is so cute. Fun fixtures and cool lighting. The food is superb every time. The staff are so friendly. I recommend making a reservation for a future date, especially if going on a weekend. My boyfriend and I love going here for special occasions; birthdays, anniversaries, and graduations. We are planning to go for another anniversary in March. Would recommend to EVERYONE! I'm sad that there are not more locations in San Diego (where I'm moving to soon). Keep it up and expand!!"}
{"text":"I came on opening day with a client and the food and service was so great I brought my family back today.  The Zucca chips are zucchini chips sliced thin and lightly pan fried.  My husband ordered the chicken parm and it was delicious.  Lighter than the chicken parms I've tasted in the past but with plenty of flavor.  The grilled artichokes were yummy and came with a lemon aioli sauce.  I also tried the cauliflower which had light bread crumbs.  The atmosphere is sort of a farm-to-table feel.    Love this place!"}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time yesterday. It was wonderful. I loved the décor, the service and the food. Meatball appetizer was great! Pizza was OK -- a little too much salt. It was better cold as leftovers late at night. :)"}
{"text":"Omg please stop!! This place is a train wreck. From the moment we arrived we were told Five minute wait which turned out to be a 20 minute wait. Then we were seated at a table and we proceeded to order a glass of wine. The glass of wine had a object in the glass which looked like a critter but we were told it was sediment. We're also asked if that made us uncomfortable that they would give us another glass instead. Then the calamari came that we ordered and it was smothered in a bed of arugula salad to hide the fact that there were only a few pieces of calamari . We ordered a Caesar salad since we were told this place is like a French restaurant which uses only the freshest ingredients in their salad dressings and their fresh pasta (repeated each time a new customer arrived #annoying) when the salad arrived  we had just started eating it when our pastas was delivered. No one seemed to care as the wait staff seemed to be very unorganized and ill trained. As we started to eat the pasta we realized that both of our dishes which were separate dishes I order the squid ink pasta which came with the smallest over cooked shrimp (reallly) and my husband ordered the chicken pasta dish with the cream sauce. Both dishes had a Marie Callender feel to it nothing felt homemade and there was absolutely no flavor to it!!! Remember when you go to this restaurant that there is no bread served at the table and there is absolutely no ambience to the place. I had not touched my pasta dish but I was asked if I needed a box. They immediately sent over a small McDonald's burger Styrofoam boxes and we were to put our own leftovers in our boxes and walk away sans a bag. Having lived in Vegas for over 25 years this is probably the worst place we've ever been to. If you want some really good authentic Italian food go to Marks Tratoria which is not a food chain it is a local place with real fresh pasta and no one ever says is like a French restaurant. PS overpriced food that is served Luke warm."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian cooking. Pastas were homemade- so tender!  We are here the night before doing the Ironman. Great options for pre race meals.  Fresh, healthy and great flavor.  I had the pasta bolognese and my husband had the braised beef short ribs with gnocchi. Also very pleasant decor and atmosphere."}
{"text":"My first visit to the newest Italian hot spot in Summerlin was as good as it gets... \"I'll be back\" -Terminator (T-800 model)  Service: We sat at the bar on the side that's outside the indoor dining area.  The weather covers were down because of the recent rain and the outdoor heaters were on to keep it cozy.  Our bartender/server was fantastic! I wish I would have gotten his name.  Food came out promptly out of the kitchen during a very busy happy hour.  We ordered more food after happy hour, during the dinner rush and the service didn't falter.    Happy Hour Menu: The Chef's Board had Meat, cheese, veggies, bread, nuts, etc was pretty to look at and very tasty.  The Margherita pizza had a thick crust on the edge and the cheese was great.  Sangria was mixed proportionately well of wine and juice, I would drink again, and again.  Menu Menu: The Braised Meatballs order came out with 6 and loaded with red sauce, good times.  The mushroom risotto and scarmoza cheese in the Arancini balls was great.  Deep fried perfectly and the red sauce complimented it well.  The Spaghetti and meatballs pasta was well made and this classic dish is an easy \"go to\" here.  The high quality ingredients and the preparation were key to the tasty dishes I tried at North Italia.  Ambiance:  Wooden ceilings and floors, white walls adorned with some simple decorations, and contemporary bulb lighting make for a clean minimalist dining area inside.  Outside, there's a boardwalk mural and plenty of seating when the weather is nice.  The attractive rectangular bar serves both the inside and outside area of the restaurant and is stocked with premium liquor.  I believe North Italia has been opened for just a month now? I am pretty impressed with how well they're operating in such a short period of time especially during that dinner rush I saw.  I'm going to suggest reservations would be the smart thing to do here. The menu is extensive with so many dishes to try and is now a go to restaurant for me when I'm feeling Italian.  I'm looking forward to their brunch and another dinner experience in the near future.  But that's another yelp tale...enjoy! =)"}
{"text":"Good pasta at North, Kierland. It's not great traditional Italian like you find in New York or San Francisco, but it's quite tasty and probably top five in Phoenix for pasta in a casual dining atmosphere. Ask for a seat in the east dining area if possible, as it's much quieter and more comfortable. If the weather allows, the patio is also quite nice for a bottle of wine with friends.  My favorite menu item is the Strozzapreti. Lots of big layers of flavor; the spinach, toasted pine nuts, and Parmesan cream really push it over the top. High praise as well for the Short Rib Radiatori - order it with extra arugula and horseradish for a real treat. The meat is tender and delicious.  If you're in the mood for a cocktail, try the Sicilian Margarita; they make it with blood orange liqueur; it's complex and really special.  A few caveats...You have to ask for bread (they don't bring it automatically, which is an Italian restaurant tradition), and they don't warm it up. Once we asked our waiter to bring warm bread and he was very confused by the request. He offered to grill it as he said they didn't \"have anything they could put it in to make it warm.\" (I guess he forgot about the ovens.) Also in most cases, the wait staff are not very knowledgeable; many don't know how to answer questions or make recommendations about the wine. But if you can overlook these details and figure out on your own what to order, you'll make North a regular stop on your culinary adventures in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience at this neighborhood restaurant. Great happy hour prices, a bottle of wine and a pizza for $20. The Zucca chips were thinly sliced, crispy and perfectly seasoned. The black mussels were tasty and a hefty portion for the price. Will definitely return to try more menu items because the service was great. The staff were friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Had a really pleasant time here last night for dinner. It was popping when we arrived at 7:30, but luckily we had reservations. Started off with their bread/dip trio which was fabulous! The hummus and cheese were extremely tasty. I didn't try the olive mixture since I dislike olives, but I'm sure it was just as good. They continually brought out more delicious bread while we waited for our main course. After a solid 45 minutes of waiting, we realized...damn, where the hell is our food!? A few minutes later the manager came over and apologized for the long wait, he offered to get us anything and he himself delivered our food when it was finished. I had the chicken & prosciutto which was amazing! The chicken wasn't dry and the prosciutto added a nice salty flavor to the meal. The potatoes were great too, soft but crispy on the outside. I scavenged off my friend's plate to taste the mushroom risotto - BOMB! Yum. Our server was a doll too. Very sweet, fast and cute too! She gave us 2 free desserts and we sucked them down quickly. A Nutella crepe? Yes please. The sour cherry bread pudding was quite tasty as well.  I ate my leftover chicken about 10 minutes ago, not gonna lie.  Overall great night. Friendliness truly does make a difference. Thank you to our server Emily for being a gem. We'll be back."}
{"text":"North is one of our favorite restaurants.  Try the house white with a chefs board, yummy. Our favorites are the spaghetti with meatballs,  spinach tortillini, or the braised short ribs. The pizzas are great too. If you don't like places that get really busy and can be pretty noisy then you won't like North no matter how good the food is. Be sure to make a reservation if you are going on a weekend night."}
{"text":"The food and wait staff are the best. We love going here for happy hour. How can u beat a great pizza and bottle of wine for $20.00. Plus split a kale salad. Perfect. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Cool fireplace on the patio. Very open feel inside. Small portions on the pasta for what you pay. Donuts for dessert...deelish."}
{"text":"First, I would like to say this place has a great atmosphere and very friendly and attentive staff.  We were greeted warmly and seated at a beautiful walnut table.  Very quickly our drink order was taken and we had regular tea which was very tasty (like the best part of the meal in my opinion).   We also opted for an appetizer of a grilled artichoke for $13 - which was 3 half artichokes grilled.  Tasty, but nothing you wouldn't get down at the claim jumper across the street for much less.  They also brought out bread which was cold out of the fridge with some butter.  For dinner, I had the spaghetti and meatballs.  The meatballs were pretty good but the pasta sauce is among the least spectacular I have had in a long time.  I don't want to say this, but the dish actually reminded me of Chef Boyardee spaghetti.  I feel kind of guilty for writing that, but unfortunately, it's true.  Having said that, my wife had Burrata Tortelloni and it was good for her - she liked the spicy sauce.  Finally, the portions were very small for the price.  2 Teas - Great 1 App - Good but not wow'd 2 Pasta Entree's - One not good, One Good (so, mediocre)  with Tip $70  Although there were a few good things, this is a \"one and done\" place for us."}
{"text":"Great place to dine and not even expensive. Loved the white truffle garlic bread and it is probably the best Italian restaurant I've been to in a long time."}
{"text":"Lovely italian restaurant. If u go to this place expecting to have carbonara, dont bother going. This was very unique and authentic restaurant. I can not remember the name of the food that we ordered but every dishes were very good. I would not say this was the best italian food i ever had, but it was very fresh and tasty. I will go back to try more and update in detail."}
{"text":"Not only was our waitress, Paulina, extremely knowledgeable about the cuisine but she also was excited about her employer and her future with the team. Friendly and passionate she helped make this experience an amazing experience for my partner and I. New favorite place. Thank you chef and the whole team."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very spacious and the decor is beautiful. Every dish we had was cooked to perfection. Our server was very welcoming and attentive. Bottles of wine were half off which was nice. They also bring warm bread and olive oil and balsamic vinegar to the table. There is also a brunch menu if you are not looking to eat pasta or pizza. Def. Need to come back to try the ink pasta!!"}
{"text":"North is a modern Italian restaurant is in the Kierland shopping center.  This meant the restrooms were actually not part of the restaurant and you had to go to communal restrooms shared by other businesses.  It was however, a damn fine meal, very lovely and just what I needed. It was probably the best meal I had on my Phoenix trip.   The only problems were the croutons on the Caesar (must remember to tell people I hate croutons), the undercooked fingerling potatoes (how horrible- I love fingerlings and these were inedible) and the overcooked artichoke hearts (so overcooked they were brownish green).   But my skirt steak was actually pretty good (and huge at 10.5 ounces) and I was in love with the roasted tiny onions. Mmm. I also liked the olives and bread (with a roasted red pepper butter) they gave us before the meal.   The waiter tried to sell me a fancy cocktail but I ordered a vodka tonic. Yes, yes, I'm snobby and only drink Belvedere or Kettle One (Vox or Turi if they have it) but never, NEVER Grey Goose now. I just can't stand that cloudy Grey Goose taste.  Our waiter was quite a trip. He would describe dishes on how they were made before and how they were made now. He said since he was the head waiter of the corporation, the ENTIRE corporation, he could persuade the kitchen to make things the old way. Erm. Okay? But I was very adamant about what I wanted and not how he wanted it. He did try to persuade me to try the Delmonico steak rather than the skirt steak but I am not a fan of the NY steak cut (and was horrified they served it pre-sliced) and much prefer the more flavorful skirt cut (also pre-sliced but that's acceptable).   After dinner, we asked if there was a casual place to hang out at and he described a bar above the Bloom Room. Well, we could not find it and we contemplated calling the restaurant and asking $10 be charged back because the head waiter of the corporation, the ENTIRE corporation led us astray."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is wonderful and the bar is great!! However the food feel flat to me. I had an ahi tuna salad and it was just ok...nothing to write home about!!  The whole menu looks too \"fru-fru\" if you know what mean!  :("}
{"text":"Cute place for Italian food. Quality food without the hefty price tag. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Order the mussels, crispy calamari, arancini  balls, pepperoni pizza, bolognese, squid ink pasta. Mussels were a nice light broth. I asked for Squid ink pasta not to be spicy and it was very delicious, not too heavy on the cream sauce either. The crispy calamari seem to be fried in old oil as it came out a tad dark. The pizza was very greasy. Half of my crust was trenched in the grease which I wasn't pleased with ......I would recommend this place and will come back and try other food on the menu."}
{"text":"Love! The $20 board and bottle on happy hour is an incredible deal! I am obsessed with the ricotta truffle garlic bread, as well! Yum!"}
{"text":"excellent.. neighborhood place.. seriously delicious.. go.. enjoy.. we will return soon."}
{"text":"My 5 stars take in to consideration price, ambiance, and quality. I had lunch that consisted of Tuscan tomato soup, tagliatelle Bolognese, and chicken parmesan. The soup was rich and wonderful, the bolognese was one of the better ones I've had in Vegas, and the chicken parm actually had some crunch. The parmesan pasta side with the chicken was not an afterthought, but very tasty. I look forward to going back again for dinner."}
{"text":"Yup, trusting Yelp with this recommendation was a fantastic idea. I was in Arcadia and wanted Italian food, nothing specific per se, I just knew I wanted something Italian and North was one of the first restaurants to pop up. After conferring with my dinner party of four, we were off.    We started with a pitcher of the best red sangria I've thus far experienced, winey yet fruity, spicy but mellow, it was good. Then we moved on to the mussels, which the table unanimously agreed that, even though between us we have eaten seafood all over the world, were the best version of any of the mollusk family we had ever eaten. Served in a butter sauce with slivers of garlic and salami, these things were damn near worth five stars alone. You must try them. Next best was the ricotta gnocchi, which although were very slightly doughy, had an incredible flavor profile with the horseradish sauce and ricotta. The seared diver scallops were also a hit, the scallops seared very well with a good cook, the risotto was tasty but got to be a little much at the end, it had a LOT of flavor. We also got a margherita pizza with a white sauce instead of the red, it was a good pie with a crispy crust and nice bite. The spicy shrimp dish was the low of the night, it did have a nice flavor but was just kind of a run of the mill pasta dish, I'd go with something more adventurous.   The fantastic food, incredible service(Stephanie I think), and inviting decor push this place over the top. North will for sure be in our regular rotation of restaurants from here on out."}
{"text":"Thursday night was packed. Was here a month ago and came back without a res and left due to 45 min wait. This is my 3rd visit.  In the crowded west side food scene, North Italia is making waves from the beginning.  The food is great, nice selection of salads, flatbreads, pastas and mains. I'm more than happy with all my selections. Tonight I pigged out, simple salad, pasta bolognese, chicken parm, also tried farm salad and chicken noodle soup. All delicious.  Ambiance was bustling. Nice indoor/outdoor thing going with bar in between. Not a sports bar vibe but was able to catch some March Madness and Hockey by reserving a high top near bar. Go Knights.  The service was friendly but not really attentive. They forgot to replace my silverware after taking it on my second and third courses. I waited 5-6 minutes for a fork with nobody around.  Still a good value and do appreciate the server recommending the third cheapest cab which was a great value. Nice touch. Decent wine list.  I will be back. Yum yum"}
{"text":"A favorite spot. Consistent service, consistently great food. Wonderful outdoor patio dining. This is just what you would ask for if you were making your own outdoor/ indoor restaurant. Did I mention the meatballs...Out of this world. Try to stay away from the bread. After one bite you will eat all of it. Dunking in the meatball marinara is the problem. If you order this appetizer be prepared for a fight. All who partake will transform into meatball monsters and a battle will soon begin. May I suggest the zucchini chips as a distraction. They are equally addicting. If you place the chips in front of your first time guests you may get all the meatballs and bread to yourself. The rest of the menu is great if you can make it past the meatballs. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"NOM. Shared the trio of dips with yummy toast, the delicious asparagus bruschetta, and the calamari (which I skipped thanks). I had a nice big strawberry/avocado/goat cheese salad and a gigantic, totally delicious mushroom and arugula pizza.  I totally only managed two slices after eating everything else but it was SO good (if a bit light on the mushrooms and heavy on the arugula). Also snagged a bite of the meatball sandwich which was really good.  I hear the short rib sandwich was only okay and the ahi tuna disappeared off the plate so fast it was scary. I would definitely eat here again and try out a pasta."}
{"text":"We liked it here but not something I'd go out of my way to dine. My son's pizza - The Pig with pepperoni, salami, and sausage was good. He said it's like a lot of other pizzas in town.  We ordered the calamari - and it came tossed with arugula. I don't think we read it in the menu, but maybe I didn't pay attention to it. My son ordered it, and they staff were kind enough to remake it without the arugula. We should have just canceled it. Without the marinara sauce or some sauce, it's just that - deep friend breaded squid. We wouldn't order this again.  I had the veggie salad and the grilled branzino. The branzino was $27 and it was good, but not $27 good. I'd get it again but not at that price. I think I'd go to Nora's and get a whole one instead.   The veggie salad - I read it had faro, but it seems it also had quinoa. It was mushy with the avocado and the grains. The only vegetable besides the lettuce was small pieces of cauliflower. I definitely would not order this again. I don't know... maybe we ordered all the wrong things.   We ate it, but we left going, what's the hype? On the people side, they were super friendly attentive. I think if you're in the area, and you want to have a relaxing meal in a nice setting, and you want to try something other than Claim Jumper, PF Changs, and Chili's, this is a nicer atmosphere with a feel of more stylized food."}
{"text":"We had reservations for 7pm-4 people. I called yo change it to 5 and spoke to the Asst GM-he gave us the best seat in the house! Smack in the dab of all the excitement.   Ordered: Arancini-rice balls Zucchini Chips Caesar salad Chicken parm  Truffle Garlic cheese bread Strozzapreti   Everything was on point!!! Food was absolutely delicious. Our waitress, Laura was great. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"It's not often that everything you order and everything everyone else orders in a group of 7 is extraordinary. But that's the case here. There was no dish left behind from their high standards and great execution.   Every dollar was well spent. The dishes are fresh and made in-house with quality ingredients and a loving touch.   I had the barrata tortelloni and tirimisu, and sampled the beet salad, pesto pasta, and several desserts (sea salt caramel bundino, doughnuts, and olive oil cake). Literally, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Location is great in the center of Kierland Commons, and the restaurant looks quite nice, but seats and tables are so packet into the place it is a little uncomfortable. Went for lunch with 3 in our party. Made reservation with Open Table and glad I did. The place was packet when we got there, would have had a wait. Service was good and our meal was OK. My guests had a pizza, cup of soup and a salad. I had the Caprese sandwich. No complaints about the food, but nothing spectacular, same formula as every other Sam Fox restaurant in the Valley. The noise level made it hard to have a business conversation over lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to the airport after a long weekend in Scottsdale.   We were fortunately there during happy hour on a beautiful AZ afternoon.  We sat outside and had the fabulous Zuca chips (4 bowls of them).   Our party of 4 also had two of their Bottle and Board appetizers.   For $20 they serve a nice bottle of wine and a select appetizer.  We had a bottle of red wine with their Chef's Board and a bottle of white wine with a margherita pizza.   Both the Chef's board and the pizza were much larger than we expected for the price of the combo and both were excellent.   I would definitely recommend stopping here if in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Environment is classic Fox Concepts.  Beautiful evening with the Christmas lights and decorations up. Fresh pasta,  vegetables, soups...have to try the fig prosciutto pizza."}
{"text":"Great happy hour- extends all day Sundays. We went as a small group, sat on the heated patio (50 degrees out) and were toasty with the outdoor heaters and fireplace. Great, cheap happy hour, $20 buys you a bottle of pretty good wine and a pizza or antipasto plate. Service was great, enjoyed the crispy thin crusted pizza, and the antipasto tray was very tasty. Will definitely return!  Ps- Valet parking was a ice touch!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! The zucca chips = addicting...which is weird...don't see how those were so addicting, but hey, definitely a great snack. I definitely want to try the bread next time though...  The entrees my friends and I had were amazing! My friend got the Tortellini... so yummy! I just wish they provided more of it, I felt bad since I ate more of hers than mine (har har). I got the gnocchi, it was not bad, I have never had gnocchi before so I don't think I will be getting that again. My other friend got the pork with apples on top? I am horrible at describing things at the moment. Anyways, that was really good too, but the pork had a little too much fat so it was kind of a bummer.   I love the atmosphere too and how they have the open kitchen, but I will say this.. I did not see the hot bartender Ron!  :( I just saw very very very short guys  :( :(  All love though haha."}
{"text":"Pasta was cooked perfectly . Service was on point. Pizza was delicious . Def recommend."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous work lunch for 8.  I love the clean \"industrial farmhouse\" vibe - open and airy without being noisy.  The modern Italian menu had a lot of great options - we were all struggling with what to order, because everything sounded great.  Note, it's a little pricier than most of my regular lunch haunts, but the food, ambiance and service were worth it.   We started with the zucca chips - yummy fried zucchini chips - sliced thin, lightly salted, yum!  One person ordered the fried cauliflower for her entrée - with asparagus and pancetta cream and a fried egg!  And you can add chicken to it for extra protein.   I ended up ordering the Strozzapeti pasta - chicken, mushroom, spinach and pine-nuts with pasta in a creamy sauce.  Wickedly good, but really rich - I could only eat half (and that's unusual!!).     The chicken parmesan was fabulous looking (and big!), the grinder sandwich is also on my list to try, and it is served with potatoes that really look delicious.  The salads were beautiful!  And the prosciutto pizza with figs was a huge hit.    No doubt - I will be back.  I can't wait to introduce the hubby to this venue and try their dinner menu next!   (PS - note, valet is your only option for this location, so be prepared!)"}
{"text":"Best Italian food I've ever had in the states. Service was outstanding, atmosphere was great, and the chicken parmesan is to die for."}
{"text":"Can I give 6 stars? Robertson, Caitlin and Allison are professionals so you are in great hands! The pizza is on point and the Sunday all day happy hour... yes please. Will dine here again and again."}
{"text":"I'm giving a mixed review. We came on a Thursday night with no reservation and were seated in about 15 minutes. The service was 5 Stars. We were seated outside but with the heaters the temperature was terrific. The atmosphere of this place is great. You could come here for a casual dinner, an after work drink, or on a date.   But. We waited an extraordinary amount of time for a pretty basic meal on a night that wasn't exceptionally busy. The manager was very polite, came over and apologized and offered us another appetizer. We were enjoying ourselves and declined as the food was expected shortly. When the food came it looked great. However. My salmon was undercooked. The center could have been served as sushi. Again the waiter and then manager were both apologetic and offered a replacement meal, etc but at this point I am put off for the evening and will eat when we get home.   When the bill came, all they had done was remove the meal I didn't eat. After the wait and the inconvenience this is grossly unacceptable.  I was excited for the potential of this place but we definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with the food here. The atmosphere is super adorable. Plants everywhere. Very stylish.  We ordered the bolognese, a pizza and the Cesar salad. All were extremely delicious!  Our service was extremely friendly. We even had a $10 off coupon for it being our first time. If it were warmer out, I would have sat on the patio!  Must try."}
{"text":"Don't you love it when a restaurant does small plates and you can order like 50 of them and everybody can sample them? Well when we went to North Italia, we ordered so many dishes and every single one that we tried was amazing. The homemade pasta is delicious. The seafood entrées are fresh. The pizza was unbelievably good. I have nothing but praise for this restaurant. Oh and you have to get the charcuterie board with the grilled bread. Simply fantastic."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant. I agree with others. When you walk in you wonder how long it may take to be seated. The place is busy. Only took a few minutes. Ambience is updated. Service was friendly and good. Food was excellent  This is a very nice upscale Italian restaurant with a friendly atmosphere. Can't wait to seat in the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this location on a Thursday night. It was crowded and we had a 20 minute wait. (normal) We received our page and we were seated quickly. We ordered our food and I asked for a diet soda with very little ice. The drinks came and ice was overflowing . Three sips later it took my server multiple passes before she came back. I asked her for a glass of diet with no ice this time. She came back with another glass with soda and a lot of ice. Food took 35 minutes to arrive and our server offered us a free desert. Food was awesome. It was a shame it took 35 minutes for a salad and tortellini. We will go back because of the food, but would like to have another server."}
{"text":"I came here with my coworkers for a work lunch. We were greeted instantly and treated with great service the whole time!!! The atmosphere is great. They have several amazing, lovely plants on several wall, and the outdoor area is very green too!! Food was delicious. The manager, Cole, made sure we felt welcome and taken care of. Would highly recommend eating at North :)"}
{"text":"Went here to pick up an order to go Friday 5/25 and started to admire the setting. Even thought about planning a night to eat here. That was instantly killed by the rude hostess who rolled her eyes at me and told me that pick up is at the bar. If this is the way you treat a pick up order I can't imagine how it would be actually eating there."}
{"text":"We went on opening weekend (waitress said it was their first weekend to be fully open). I've been to many restaurants on opening week/weekend and so much was lacking here and I was so excited to try this place.   We got there and had reservations and were seated immediately. Our waitress was very sweet and helpful so no complaints there. We ordered an appetizer that came out very quickly and tasted great (garlic should have been in much smaller pieces). It then took another 45 minutes to get our food. Our kids were unmanageable by the time our food got to the table and by that point it was hard to enjoy much.  We were brought bread about 30 minutes into the wait because the food was taking so much longer than anticipated. The food was mediocre. The potato and spinach daily special pizza was WAY too spicy and had barely any potatoes. The fig and goat cheese pizza with prosciutto was good, but way too many figs and not enough goat cheese, leaving the pizza just way too sweet. Super chewy and doughy spots on the pizzas, leaving other spots charred and too crispy to eat.   I can completely understand opening weekend can be rough, but we weren't even offered a gesture of kindness for having to sit and wait forever and it even took the same 45 minutes to bring the kid's food out. Just unacceptable to me for a restaurant that's not necessarily cheap. Most places would offer an appetizer comp or maybe a dessert comp even for the wait and frustration, but nothing.   I think we might go back and try it again, but it would have been nice to see management walking around to tables having to wait for extended amounts of time explaining the slow food situation etc. If we go again, it'll be sans kids just in case the wait is always this bad for food.  Long story not so short, the food is probably normally much better when things aren't so fast and furious in the kitchen and the waitress was very nice, but was just really hoping for a better experience."}
{"text":"Perfect spot and a great dining experience.  Just order the \"Italian Grinder.\"  End of story. Wow did I have food envy!  (\"Italian Grinder: Salami, Prosciutto, Turkey, Cherry Pepper Salad.\") I got a good Chicken Parm and it was nothing to flip over beyond fresh and prepared with quality ingredients.  BUT that sandwich! I had a bite of my  husband's sandwich because it looked amazing, as my mouth felt blasé with what I ordered. (I swear I'm just getting lazy about ordering these days.)   AWESOME sandwich! Loved it!  I wanted to go back to apologize to my mouth for feeding it something so bland compared to this divine sandwich!  I made faces at my husband as he teased me about how good is sandwich. :( sigh.   TLDR: Don't make your mouth mad. Get the Italian Grinder. Great little spot in an outdoor mall strip. Worth coming to as you enjoy your shopping adventures."}
{"text":"Fantastic!   The Branzino is absolute perfection...and the Spaghetti and Meatballs are the best you will ever have.  Great food paired with excellent service made for a lovely evening...Pretty sure our server's name was Aaron...  Please open in southern california"}
{"text":"OMG!!! Do yourself a favor and order the artichoke appetizer. It's greasy, but the flavor is to die for!!!   I went to lunch there with my mom (it's her favorite restaurant in Scottsdale) and we sat on the patio. It was a nice quiet place to have lunch after a busy morning. The staff is super friendly and helpful.   In addition to the incredible artichoke appetizer I had the Italian grinder. It was the perfect balance of spice from the salami and comfort of the turkey on a fresh baked ciabatta. My side salad had a bit too much dressing for my taste, but the greens were a wonderful compliment to the heartiness of the sandwich."}
{"text":"Solid bistro fare in a mall complex, accompanied by modern, hip decor and vibe. I went here for lunch while my wife had a work conference in town, and I had the meatball burger, which was pretty tasty, and the kale side dish, which was a little -- OK, way -- too salty. Service was excellent and friendly and accommodating re: me bringing my four-month-old daughter in a stroller with me. I'd go again if I'm ever in Phoenix/Scottsdale again. I had a bit of trouble finding non-chain restaurants in this part of town (could totally be my inexperience/unfamiliarity with the area), so this was a nice find."}
{"text":"Server was very sweeet. Once she knew it was my first time, she got me a plate of the zuchinni chips on the house to try! The appetizer plate was delicious along with the scallop risotto! This place is a slightly smaller, more italian version of Culinary Dropout at The Yard!"}
{"text":"North had been recommended to my husband and I so we decided to go on Sunday evening for Happy Hour.   The HH menu did not appeal to us therefore we chose a homemade seafood pasta and Cesear salad to share. We received 2 salads although we ordered 1 to share.  The croutons were too large and stale, the dressing was scarce and vinegary.  The seafood pasta contained a modest amount of shrimp and calamari but the pasta was very undercooked.  My \"house\" vodka arrived as overly dirty although it was not ordered that way.  The service was not attentive and the food did not meet our expectations.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with pasta from scratch?   Well you can't.  Dinner was simply amazing and the service was good as well.  Cool vibe. It was a little loud, but I think that was the case because it was packed. A definite go to."}
{"text":"I came in for Sunday brunch not too long ago and I was very impressed.  I'd been meaning to get to North for quite some time but location and timing evaded me.  Now that i've been, I certainly will find the time to go back.    Tradition dictates, for a watered down italian like myself, to eat Italian cuisine on Sundays.  Lucky for me North has happy hour all day on Sunday as well as a brunch menu to select from.  With 1/2 price bottles of wine it's really a great day to come to North.  We went with the $20 board (meats/cheese/etc) and bottle of wine to start and also ordered some pasta.  Everything was great.  The service was fantastic, the restaurant is beatiful (in that open kitchen industrial sort of way), and the value was tremendous.  Fox restaurants are typically pretty good but this one may be my favorite.  That's in terms of food.  If i want to drink $2 Icehouse and play ping pong, I still prefer Culinary Dropout at the Yard."}
{"text":"It bums me out to write a poor review for one of my favorite restaurants but I suppose the standard of excellence is not upheld at all locations.   My suspicions are that poor service, lack of care for customer experience and over all shabby ambiance is, in part, due to leadership.   I say this because this location is split into two areas - one that is deemed a bar (quick drinks, apps etc) and the other their more formal dinning experience.   Well not having experienced this split before, we walked into the \"bar\" area that basically smelled like a dive bar with half cleaned tables scattered about and yet nearly empty. Instead of walking us to our table, the manager (my assumption as he was later dictating orders) pointed to a table and we made our way over.   To be fair, we decided to sit outside soon after but because no one was actually accompanying us to our table, we moved outside only to find out we were not in the dining section of the restaurant. Got it. So we simply got up and left.   This is what sets off the rest of the dinning experience. By the time we made contact with a hostess - there are 4 to 5 of them, all with dazed looks on their faces and no greeting until I say hello.   Awesome. And by that I mean I am seriously shocked that we were receiving such poor service at such a greatly reputed restaurant.   Let me make a long story short for you - our waiter either checked on us every minute or was gone for 15 min periods. Employees in general around us (small space here) conducted themselves (surprisingly unprofessional) ... I'm used to Vito's no nonsense policy in Tucson but who am I?   Any good news? Yeah, the food was excellent and consistent with what we usually get.   Final word? I love North and I'll be sticking to the one in Tucson."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic.  We had the Bruschetta and chefs board for the happy hour and pasta and pizza for dinner. All were very good. Amos was awesome he even took time to take a few pictures for us.  David was a great host and accommodated our party of six .  Thank you to all for making our annual get together a Success"}
{"text":"Really good brunch place. The atmosphere is very different from most restaurants. The service was good, they were prompt and friendly. The food was good and I would recommend to anyone who hasn't been here. One thing I would wish they had more was people valeting. It's a long wait when you have a big group and one one person valeting. Other than that I think the restuarant is great place for lunch."}
{"text":"I sat near the kitchen.  The chef kept things moving.  I had my app within a few minutes.  I had the meatballs.  Very good.  My server kept my soda full and my entree was out before I knew it.  The place was busy for a Tuesday but serve was fantastic.     Note: parking is valet so have a little cash for tip if you are inclined."}
{"text":"After a rough day at work, my husband and I decided to treat ourselves by going out to Zinc. Unfortunately, they were closed so we wound up at North instead. Well, it certainly isn't Zinc so I won't compare it to that. It is a Fox Concepts restaurant, so it did remind me a little of Olive & Ivy. Some of the dishes and ingredients reminded me a lot of Olive and Ivy (scallops, beef brisket, etc) and the cocktails sounded familiar.   When we first entered, we were greeted by two hostesses. One of them asked where we'd like to sit and lead us to a patio seating of our choice. The inside was loud and filled with people whereas the patio was quiet and only had one or two other couples. Our waitress showed up rather quickly and took our drink order (just water). She came back with the waters and asked if we were ready to order. I went with the scallops on mushroom risotto and my husband went with the beef short rib gnocchi. Our food arrived rather quickly and was presented nicely. My dish was good but couldn't decide what flavor it wanted to be. The risotto was salty, extremely so. The scallops were citrusy, extremely so. Then some areas weren't salty or citrusy. It wasn't a well-combined flavor experience and I felt like I had to eat it in pieces as to not shock my palette. My husband enjoyed his gnocchi, whereas I thought the actual gnocchi was flavorless. (The beef short rib was delicious.)   As the night progressed, I noticed that the waiters and waitresses didn't work in teams or even really acknowledge each other. Our water cups drained and our waitress didn't come back for some time. However, two different waiters walked by, with a water pitcher and didn't fill our cups. When our waitress finally did come back and asked if we needed anything, I mentioned water and she was quick to grab a pitcher and fill it.   I've been to other restaurants where there is more of a team work/effort feeling and everything runs smoothly. Not sure if this was an off night or what."}
{"text":"We discovered North Italia recently from visiting the Arcadia location.   The food was unique and tasty. We ordered two full bottles of red sangria which was pretty amazing. It serves about 3 ppl.   The truffle garlic bread was probably the best part of our dining experience. It was delicious!   The pizzas are well prepared and shareable. The service is excellent!!!  Highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"I absolutely love North! My favorite time to stop by is their brunch on Sundays. I recommend everything on the menu, the quality in their food is outstanding."}
{"text":"This was my second time dining at North Italia.  The first time was the week they opened (Dec 2017) and the service was very slow, but my friend & I decided to give it a second chance in hopes that the slow service back then was due to how new they were.  Well, lets just say the service is still slow (entrees were served 1 hour after we were seated) and our server lacked basic customer service.    He was very friendly; however, I ordered the potato, sausage & kale soup as an appetizer (their featured item he told me about), but he brought me tomato soup. While he had the soup in front of me, he explains that the featured items he mentioned were incorrect.  I felt that I was not given a choice to decline the soup (I was really looking forward to the soup I ordered) as he had it in front of me while telling me what happened (keep in mind we were still charged for his mistake).  The food was okay.  Nothing to really rave about.  Usually, a spoon would be served with spaghetti and meatballs; however, we only had forks & knives.  When our server bought us the bill, he placed it right in front of me assuming that I was paying.  I know this review is mainly about an individual's customer service; however, this is when management needs to train better on proper dining etiquette when hiring young servers.  After giving them a second chance, unfortunately, we will not be returning based on the lack of training and low food quality."}
{"text":"Dammit! Why am I the only one who seems to think these Fox Concepts aren't quite as great as they make themselves out to be? Maybe I'm just not cool enough to \"get it,\" or maybe, just MAYBE, I've been to one too many restaurants over the years to the point where I'm able to ignore the showmanship, style, and \"vibe\" of a restaurant, focusing almost solely on how good the food is (or isn't).  My girlfriend and I have visited North Italia on two separate occasions. The first, I'd probably rate as a four star dining experience, with the second trip only coming in at a measly two.  For a Fox Concepts restaurant, the setup is pretty much what you'd expect. Ultra-modern décor, very sleek, hip, and trying to give off the feel of a local restaurant, despite being a pretty large chain that has over nine different locations all over the country.  I'm not a fan of the valet, or what I refer to as \"forced valet,\" meaning that if you want to actually park at the restaurant, you really have no other choice but to use their valet service. Yes, it's convenient, but I don't like being trapped into using a service that I've never felt is necessary. Don't make me get a root canal when all I need is a dental cleaning!  For the first trip, we had a very charming server, who actually went above and beyond to make our first experience a good one. We were given a bowl of free zucca chips, which were excellent. We opted to order some truffle garlic bread as a starter. My girlfriend really liked it, while I've personally never been a big fan of truffle, as it generally stinks and has a bizarre metallic-like scent and flavor that I've never been able to ignore. Additionally, we ordered a bolognese pasta, which was actually far better than what we've had at many other local places (including Nook and Central Bistro). For pizza, we ordered a prosciutto, which included two of our favorite additions: figs and goat cheese. It was decent, although not comparable to some of the more well known pizza establishments in Phoenix.  We were hoping to try this nutella and banana dessert we keep spotting on Yelp, only to find out that they don't have it anymore for unknown reasons. Instead, we ordered the salted caramel budino, which we both were quite impressed with.  For our second trip, almost eight months later, we decided to start with the grilled cauliflower, which included a fried egg, asparagus, bread crumbs, and a bit of lemon. It was extremely good! No free zucca chips this time, much to our disappointment. We decided to change up the pastas and pizzas this time, opting for spaghetti and meatballs and a bacon and egg pizza. We requested the pasta first, with the pizza as a second course, but our server apparently mixed them up.    The spaghetti was, in short, not very good. We both were simultaneously taken back with how salty it was, making it extremely difficult to say anything positive about the dish. The pizza, on the other hand, had ingredients that were decent in quality, but they unfortunately botched the crust. There's a fine line between charring a pizza and burning a pizza. Char actually subtly enhances the flavor, while burning it basically overpowers the flavor. Unfortunately, this crust was full-blown burnt. No good!  This time, for dessert, since we gave up seeking the banana and nutella combination, we ordered a dark chocolate tart, that allegedly has nutella mousse. We couldn't detect the nutella, but I suppose it was good enough.  In the end, I'd give it three stars. There are clearly good and bad choices on the menu. Unfortunately, despite a trendy and lively atmosphere, it's not enough to bump it into regular rotation. Sadly, there are far better options for Italian food in Phoenix if you're willing to look past all the glitz in North Italia."}
{"text":"We came here looking for a casual dinner. We were surprised!  Yes the atmosphere and people had a casual feel.  The tortellini and Chicken scarpetti were excellent.  Come on Sunday for $16 bottles of montepulciano.  We will come back!!"}
{"text":"First off - my husband and I received amazing service! This was probably one of the most pleasant experiences I've had since moving here. The food was also amazing. The chicken parmigiano paired great with some white wine and his alfredo was good too. We skipped dessert this time, but hope to try it out next time! Again, the service is so good! We also sat outside which was very nice as inside is a little crowded."}
{"text":"Service was beyond terrible . Hostess had a bad attitude when we asked not to sit at high top table and there was multiple others available.The bartender took 10-15 minutes to take order and I ordered sangria and a Bloody Mary and it's was the worst I had ever had.Tasted like Tabasco sauce but the sangria was good. Next step finally seated after 30 minutes manager came to table and apologized for hostess attitude problem . We ordered 3 pizzas and a meat cheese tray as a meal each. Half way in to the pizza they bring out the cold tray for my wife's meal .After we had to remind them of the missing entree. So that's 3 strikes in one visit. The foods good but not worth the hassle"}
{"text":"North Italia is another one of Sam Fox's restaurant concepts. The food is consistent, service is always on point and they have a great wine selection by the glass as well as great cocktails. I always recommend starting with the Zucca Chips (which are you guessed it zucchini chips!), their calamari and meatballs are on point as well. Salad wise I love their Tuscan Kale salad with has crispy pancetta, charred grapes, apple, pistachio, bread crumb and a parm vinaigrette. Entrée wise, I always stick with the Short Rib Radiatori... the horseradish cream sauce they serve with it is what dreams are made of.  If you up in the area its a solid lunch or dinner spot!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. Great pasta dishes... John, our server, was awful. He took FOREVER on every part of the service. I'm a pretty patient person but to wait 15 minutes when we are seated... 15 minutes for drinks... 15 minutes to get a check... 15 minutes for him to come back and get the check. Towards the end of our service the place emptied out, its close to 9pm.. he still took forever. I almost asked the hostess to cash us out before we saw him. For the amount of money you spend you think they would box your food. They box it at Cheesecake Factory... and \"lesser\" end restaurants. The tables are tiny here and to maneuver the dishes, boxes, glasses, boxes... I feel like for the area and the cost the experience should've been a little better."}
{"text":"Can I just say WOW! An upscale looking and trendy restaurant without the pretentious and price of one.   I had almost lost all hope in finding a great restaurant in this side of the valley (Arrowhead), and NoRTH really swept me off my feet. The sangria is worth ordering; with the blend of raspberries, blueberries and blackberries- tastes just like juice! The warm + soft bread with their tomato dip is addicting, I couldn't stop eating it even after they brought out the roasted artichoke as our appetizer.   Our dishes were delicious- the moist salmon was cooked perfectly atop a bed of roasted squash and spinach in a light creamy sauce, while my friend's baked ziti bolognese looked just as good as it tasted. We topped off the night with the panna cotta, truly the cherry on top of a wondrous meal.   If you're looking to impress your friends without breaking the bank or wasting gas driving to Scottsdale, I highly recommend NoRTH. Word on the street is their happy hour is pretty bomb, I will be back.."}
{"text":"This was our first Italian restaurant we went to when we moved down here and we were pleasantly surprised. It's located in the fanciful kierland commons and has a very welcoming and romantic ambience. Food-wise, they hand make their pasta daily so you know it's fresh.  My favorite dish here by far is the chicken parmesan; They provide a hardy portion with excellent flavor. The gnocchi here is very rich and satisfying while the spicy shrimp pasta has a nice ginger-semi spicy flavor to it. Bread is brought to you as an appetizer with a tomato butter spread, so an ordering appetizer isn't really necessary. What is necessary though is an order of the tiramisu! It is downright delicious! Hands down the tastiest tiramisu in the valley! The first layer of this fantastic dish is a plethora of mini-malt chocolate balls that covers the coffee flavored cake layer. These malt balls are what make this dessert dish top notch in my opinion. Customer service here is mostly on point, but there have been some exceptions. That's why I'm giving it 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in the area. They have fantastic food, great bread, interesting choices, and good service. I've had a number of things. Just try anything. It's all delicious!  The restaurant has great interior design in a very cool building."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Biggest gripe...their 'house speciality\" bolognese tastes like spaghetti O's meat sauce. The noodles are good but it just isn't worth tagging this dish as their house specialty. I sent it back, not worth the calorie splurge. Had the strozzapreti and that was delicious. Also...the grilled artichoke felt slightly undercooked, not great. It would also be nice if the table served bread were warm.  Delicious options- the truffle garlic bread, the heirloom tomato salad, the Strozzapreti. Wish I would have tried the chicken parmesan! Our server was very nice and attentive and they took off two of our bolognese dishes since we didn't like them much which was the right customer service move and very appreciated. We'd actually return...now we know what to get!"}
{"text":"First off! The handmade pasta is ridiculous. The apps were great, didn't get a chance to try pizza but I do think the pasta is the star. Small menu of pizza and pasta but willing to adjust to your needs! Good wine list. Modern environment and open kitchen! Will be back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but the food is very bland and nothing really to write about but here it goes...first off I would think if you hire a hostess you would hire someone that reflects a classy restaurant not someone with tats and nose rings all over the place. If that's your thing great, but to welcome me to a classy restaurant, sorry no! Second the staff was not accommodating at all. Barely checked on us and barely knew the menu. The food was bland and nothing special. Since this is northern Italian food I expect it to be some what different than southern Italian food which tends to be more flavorful and robust! North Italia reminds me of a place for millennials to hang out with and try to be cool. There are so many new Italian places in the area that I would never have a reason to come back here. Pricing wasn't bad, portions were ok but bland Italian food is an oxymoron!"}
{"text":"You know a restaurant is GREAT when you decide you will need to visit it's other location that's closer to home when you return from vacation.   The ambiance is hip, modern, and clean. The wait staff is friendly and on top of things.   1) Italian Grinder: this was sooo good. The side salad that came with it was perfectly dressed.   2) The Pig Pizza: love the crust! It's nice and crispy. The pig was a lil salty and greasy for me but still a delicious pizza. Would definitely try one of their other pizzas next time.  3) Meatball sub: didn't order this but saw one delivered to another table. Must try this next time and get the crispy potatoes!!"}
{"text":"Best salad in town!  Had great coffee after dinner too.  Wonderful menu variety, fun wines, nice atmosphere.  Its a shame I don't live closer!"}
{"text":"You know when you have that long-time crush that you finally get to go on a date with, and while you're there you're all giddy and smiling, but once you get home you realize that it wasn't all it was cracked up to be?  That's my experience with North.  I went to meet a friend for their happy hour, and it was an absolutely gorgeous day so we sat at the bar outside.  The patio is very inviting, comfortable so it was nice to enjoy our meal out there.  The thing is, that is honestly the best part about North; the atmosphere.  Overall it's hip, casual, and seemingly a great date place, but the heart of the matter (the food) is solidly mediocre.  We got the cheese and meat board, which was enjoyable but nothing extraordinary, and I took a salad and pizza to go.  Now, while I was there swilling my glass of wine, I was thinking about how much I was enjoying North and how I couldn't believe I hadn't been there earlier.  However when I got home with my food I realized that I had been under the \"everyone thinks that guy is hot\" aphrodisiac, because my salad and pizza were pretty disappointing.  The salad was TINY!!!  And I mean smaller-than a-side-salad tiny.  For $11 I expect to at least be half full after that.  And the pizza was okay, not great so it was an 0 for 2 on the take home scale.  I truly did enjoy the dining atmosphere at North, so I would go back to try the happy hour again, but if I'm looking for an all-encompassing food, wine and ambiance experience, then I will definitely go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We went to North Italia last night for the first time. We couldn't believe how busy it was due to the fact that they just recently opened. We were seated within 25 minutes. The space is open and fresh. It was bustling with activity inside and so I would not recommend the inside seating if  need a quiet place to discuss business or are looking for a quiet romantic dinner.  HOWEVER, they do have outdoor seating and that would probably be perfect.    My husband and I shared the Chicken Parmesan and the meatball appetizer which comes with the most delicious bread and sauce.  The chicken Parmesan was the best we have ever had. The pasta that they serve with it is creamy and delicious. This is our new favorite place for Italian and we can't wait to go back!  Thank you for opening in Summerlin!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I love this cute restaurant! Their staff is super friendly and I love how managers are always involved. They have great happy hour: favorite one is their daily bruchetta only 5 bucks & Margherita pizza only 8 bucks! I also tried their branzino and calamari and those two will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Good food.  Terrible service.  Terrible service. Terrible service.  Noisy. Don't go there if you are over 30, because you will be the only one!  They made so many mistakes on our orders, they comped us a bowl of soup.   They tried to be nice, but they were just overwhelmed with too many people and a kitchen that is not yet operating like seasoned professionals."}
{"text":"NoRTH has that standard sleek/sexy/urban/whatever leitmotif of FOX Restaurant Concepts.   I mean gone are the fruit chunks you see in typical sangria. Instead, there's a pureed sweet confection that's a bit too niminy priminy. But I can't find too much fault in it tastes wise.   The bruschetta was topped with asparagus and prosciutto. I was afraid the cheese would melt the bread out of sight. Ohs and ahs of satisfaction worthy. Best part of the meal hands down.   The pizza we ordered was scanty with the prosciutto and heartiest on the fig.  Therefore, yeah I like this place, but it's not what I'd call \"Modern Italian Cuisine\". Don't kid yourself."}
{"text":"We go here twice a month and love it every time. I haven't had anything that was bad. The home made pasta is amazing. The budino is also a top choice!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Vegas and found this great restaurant. The food is delicious and apparently everything is made fresh each day. We had a stellar server, Bonnie, who was so sweet and friendly. She really enhanced our guest experience. We left with a full stomach and a smile on our faces. This will be a restaurant we go to regularly."}
{"text":"I went for late lunch with my son right before flying back to San Jose. We liked their open kitchen, interior design, all servants were friendly with smiles, and foods were amazing!  We loved their specialities. Our servant Ms. Isabella, introduced us about their foods so well, and her recommendations made us such a happy Sunday afternoon. She was super friendly with big smile, too. I wanted to talk with manager how well she was educated about their own dishes...  We will definitely go back this restaurant when we visit PHX area next time!"}
{"text":"Appetizers... -calamari-so, I usually don't like calamari because it is chewy and gives an icky mouth-feel. I actually liked this fried calamari!!! Yum! -fonduta-a cheesy fondue with jam on top, doesn't taste tomato-y. I thought it was quite good and I ate more than should have been my allotted portion! -zucca chips-paper thin zucchini slices, fried; we got some lemon dip with them. Pretty darn good, especially when you consider how gross most zucchini is!   Entrees... -strazzapreti-a chicken pasta dish-actually freaking good. -short rib entree-this ties Becketts Table for me in ranking Best Short Ribs in Town! The veggies that come with it are super good too!! -pasta bolonese-my hub thought it was amazing and didn't particularly want to share, but I thought this wasn't exactly my fave, so it worked out well for us. -spicy shrimp pasta-it was good but not amazing. I'd stick to one of the above recommendations instead.  Desserts... -donuts-really good, melt in your mouth, with a lemon dipping sauce that's amazing. -tiramisu-delicious, less cake-y and more creamy than usual, and the chocolate balls on top were quite good. -salted caramel thing-my personal favorite. It was like a very rich creme brûlée that was very flavorful of caramel n salt.  All of the desserts are worth getting again.  -atmosphere-pretty loud (on a Friday night)... I had to shout across the table so my somewhat hard of hearing dad-in-law could hear me.  -service-very good.  All in all, a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Went to lunch here with 2 girlfriends.  The food was good as was the service.  My issue was when I paid my bill.  I paid with cash and was waiting for my change for quite a while.  I finally had to ask another server if I could get my server to bring me my change.  Waited some more and the manager came over and asked what I needed.  Told her I needed my change.  She left and came back a few minutes later with my change however it was not the correct change.  I received $2.00 back but my change should have been $2.62.  I asked about this and she said that was all of the overage in the cash drawer.  My server was no where to be seen.  I know $0.62 is not a lot of money however I work hard for my money and I value honesty.  I will not be going back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Red Sangria. Delish ! Chef board. delish ! Squid ink pasta and margarita pasta. Delish !   This place is so cute, wish I lived closer so I could pop in for an appetizer and a glass of wine. Recommend reservations they get busy."}
{"text":"Totally not impressed!!!  Just got back from having a dinner there. Kinda, hungry now. Humm... What can i eat around here. Ohh yes, anyhow. There is nothing specifically wrong about it, just does not feel right. Crispy pizza was soggy, feta cheese was overpowering, they skimped on basil leaves, and even huge piece of Tiramisu was so alcoholy i would have probably gotten a ticket if i was pulled over.   For the amount of money we paid it should have been way way better.  \"I like. NOT!\""}
{"text":"Gianna is the best! (I hope I have her name right) she always knows exactly what to suggest and remembers even the smallest details. The pastas are insanely good and they have one of the best happy hours around."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love North so much I'm there almost every week if not every week and I have to alternate between the two locations because I'm embarrassed because of my frequent visits.   I'm a big fan of Fox Restaurants in general, however North is my absolute favorite. I've tried nearly everything on the menu at this point. Some favorites include the Chef's board (one of the best charcuterie in the Valley), the calamari with some kind of magical lemon sauce, the mussels in a heavenly butter sauce served with grilled bread, the pesto pasta, the braised short rib over polenta (my favorite entree), and the tiramisu with chocolate pearls! I could go on and on, but you get the point.   My favorite drink to order when I go out is a Moscow Mule, but North is serving up their own version, the Milano Mule, which has a grapefruit twist..not even a huge fan of grapefruit, but if it isn't obvious by now, North is serving up a little bit of crack in every dish.   Finally, happy hour! $20 for a bottle of wine/pitcher of sangria and either a margarita pizza or the daily pizza OR the chef's board! Oh and happy hour is ALL day on Sunday :)"}
{"text":"All day Sunday Happy hour!  Whoo hooo  So this is a little spot tucked away off Camelback. I originally went on a date here and the guy was kinda lame, but I loved the place. Win some/lose some.   I don't know why I want to call the place cozy, as it's pretty spacious within, but somehow  it feels cozy.  I love the fact that the kitchen is open. There is a quaint bar up near the front and a patio as well.    They offer fantastic happy hours with $5 wines, beers and such and they also offer a variety of small plates as well . I'm a fan of the chef's board.  This consists of several cheeses, salami's, proscuitto, a jam, various breads, olives.  For $10? What a steal.  The chips are fresh and homemade as well and they are sinfully delicious.  I\"ve only gone for happy hours and it can be full. Not overpowering full like Postino's , but not empty at all.  Parking can be probelmatic but they do offer free valet."}
{"text":"Ahh, North, where do I even begin. Perhaps with Zucca chips, which I dream about?? Just kidding (well maybe..they're that good). Everything here is amazing; I have yet to see anyone order a bad dish. For dinner I usually get the salmon or spinach ravioli, yum. Started coming for brunch on the weekends and absolutely love their egg dishes (have had the sandwich, scramble, and frittata) with the awesome crusty bread on the side. :) Probably my latest favorite is the Jump Start - chocolate milk shaken and served cold with 2 espresso shots... so simple but so magical!"}
{"text":"These guys are onto something good.   Large energetic room.  Menu for everyone.  Nice wine list and cocktails.  Called ahead and they knew we were coming. So no wait for a table.   The kitchen was slammed. But this being the first week that's not uncommon.   The manager brought us out an amazing charcuterie platter as a Comp for the long wait. This thing was huge.   The food was amazing and the portioned were large.   We will be back."}
{"text":"Love everything I've tried on the menu and they make a mean scotch on the rocks. I've had the pizza, mussels, and a few of the salads. All GREAT!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed an awesome lunch.  Gluten free pesto pasta dish with gluten free salted caramel dessert. Everything was excellent.  This place has been around a while and I was here when it opened. These guys have stepped it up big time. It's better than ever. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've officially been to North once, but unofficially twice. The first was through trying brunch leftovers my husband brought home (The Pig pizza and Short rib gnocchi) and the 2nd I had to try for myself first hand. So first thing, parking lot is small. We happened to have reservations as they were opening, so it wasn't a problem. They have complimentary valet, kinda weird for such a small lot. But helpful. Interior is clean farmhouse rustic. I loved the family style table we were seated at, wish I could've taken that table home with us. Definitely great for groups, great for babies/kids. There is also a beautiful bar area, if its just a party of one or two. Now, for the food, that's really what u go for right? Ambiance is great and all, but what about the food? Top to bottom delicious, creative and executed to perfection.  Brunch Cocktail, first on the menu, The Red Rooster. An italian spin on a brunch favorite. Bloody mary with freshly crumbled parmesan mixed throughout and decorated with caprese. Caprese? Yes, one leaf of basil, tomato, and mozzarella. It sucks that I've never come up with this combination on my own. Bloody mary = tomato, italian = tomato, cheese, basil. Simple, creative, delicious. I would definitely get this again OR dare even try it at home.  Our chosen appetizers - zucca chips, bread board and custard filled donuts... is that a lot for appetizers, well yes, but that's not the point. Friends highly recommended the zucca chips, which I was more than willing to try even though I had no idea what they were. As it turns out, it isn't some exotic delicacy. Just fried zucchini. I don't say that lightly though because these were not the TGIFridays chunky cut, breaded, and fried zucchini. Zucca chips, were exactly that, chip-style - thinly sliced, slightly crispy, lightly salted, mini-zucchini goodness. Bread board has house-made rustic bread. Light, soft, airy on the inside with an crunchy outer crust. The usual thinly sliced charcuterie, cheese, olives, spiced mixed nuts, and a sweet chutney. Again, simple - but done well. Now, the unexpected we're the custard filled donuts. The very first menu item is pastries, choice of cinnamon rolls or custard filled donuts. We went with donuts. An order comes with 3, we got 2 orders. And they were nice enough to accommodate us with +1 for our party of 7. The donuts were unexpected because one, they are kinda hidden in the menu, and two - this place just screams savory - not sweet, but these little donuts (donut holes), crispy fried dough, dusted with powdered sugar, moist inside with a creamy lemon custard. That custard was so good, we were scraping it from the plate after having devoured our little tasty donut ball.  I was impressed with the short rib gnocchi i tasted from leftovers last week. Following that theme, I selected the short rib hash for my entree. I was not disappointed. Usually, my gripe,with hash - is the hash part. Usually too much potato. Not here. Perfect amount of short rib to potato. The hash was soft potato cubes with red peppers and onions. The short rib, moist and fall apart tender. All topped with poached egg. The egg yolk was soft but not runny. I would've preferred a runny egg, but did not affect overall taste. Buttered Toasted bread served on the side was so good. Toasted bread? Really - so good. One side was purposely burnt and it just worked.  It's a 45 minute drive, but will definitely come back -  gotta try more of the menu. Thanks to our friends for introducing us to North Fattoria Italiana. I don't even know what Frattoria means, but doesn't really matter. It is just good."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start.  I just had the most enjoyable experience at North Italia.  Man was this place busy!  Thankfully we had made reservations.  I almost didn't, being a Sunday.  But turns out they have a fantastic all day Sunday happy hour.  Pizzas and chef boards, bruschetta oh my!  Let's not forget the zucca chips (which were great by the way).  All the staff were SO friendly and our server was beyond helpful.  Loved it!  Not to mention I liked the crowd this particular evening...everyone seemed to be having a lovely evening.  It's a louder place but I actually enjoyed the hip and happening vibe.  I highly recommend.  The food was crazy good too!"}
{"text":"Terrific apps except for some weird fried zucchini. Stick to bruschetta and meatballs.  Caesar salad was decent.  Short ribs and polenta was fantastic. Strangely, waiter did not recommend them, but since I was already drinking red wine, well, I had no choice..  Anyway service was...not terribly intuitive...I don't want to ask for wine refill...sometimes I asked, other times they got it. Do I need a knife? YES?!?"}
{"text":"Ate here last night and it was amazing. The food was delicious, the service was great, can't wait to go again! New favorite spot!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. Great service, good food. The bolognese is my favorite. Great happy hour (bottle and board or pizza for $20)"}
{"text":"Just in town and needed my Italian food fix and boy did I get it.. Let me sum it up; * Valet Easy Parking * Upbeat Open Concept Dining w Generous Bar, High Ceilings, Great Acoustics plus Outdoor Dining * Friday night jamming and we had 6:30 reservations... Seated Immediately * Our awesome & knowledgeable waiter Mitchell pampered us like he knew we just flew in (How did he know) * Drinks came in 10 min (Thank You) * Grilled Artichokes for appetizers.. Yum! With cheesy garlic dipping sauce * Mitchell knew & thoroughly explained each dish suggesting options such as; Cheese Tortellini adding sausage , which dish is heavier & richer, Bolognese  or  Ricotta  Gnocchi  w crispy braised ribs. W granules of sea salt that exploded w flavors..Unbelievable)  * when asked whether we should go w Tiramisu.. Mitchell once again knew all about the Carmel w whipped cream dessert & Olive Cake... Clearly these waiters know the food!! * Great music, awesome food, super Kool environment & Killer service makes this one of my best ever Italian restaurants... And I cook Italian !! Thank for the fine Art of an Amazing Restaurant experience!!"}
{"text":"Great gem in North Scottsdale. Had dinner with friends who we haven't seen for many months. It's one of their favourite places and it did not disappoint. Hayley our waitress was absolutely AWESOME all evening, attentive to our table and our questions about the menu.  I had the Farm Salad which is very tasty and the house special which is their hand made spaghetti bolognese. It was very good. Triple meat mix in the sauce (which is also how I make it myself) when I do the same dish.  My wife had a Caesar salad which looked good (I didn't try it) and the meatballs, which were tasty and seasoned well.  Our friends ate pretty much the same options except my friends wife had the short rib radiatori, which looked very good too.  Dessert was the mixed gelato and I had the strawberry mascarpone tart.. both lovely.  We loved this place so much, we decided to go the next night with another couple who had just arrived in town for a few days..  Bellissimo.."}
{"text":"Love this place - started our food romance at North Italia in Kierland, but found this location closer to home.. The food is soooo good - authentic and great flavors. Portion sizes are perfect and not too big (which is a nice change) Wine list is brief but nice - combinations of reserve and house choices.. but quite a few selections from Italian wine regions too.."}
{"text":"Great restaurant off the Strip in Las Vegas. It was our first visit, so our party of four decided to follow the recommendations given by our server, Gerardo. From start to finish, every single bite was excellent. Squid ink pasta, \"The Pig\" pizza, short rib pasta, and the salmon were our choices. Short rib pasta with the white cream sauce was particularly good. Couldn't get enough!  After the main course, we had the tiramisu and hazelnut torta, paired with a \"Jump Start\" coffee. Again, Gerardo's recommendations were top notch!  Ambience is great. Love the decor - transitional modern with rustic, yet elegant, features consistently throughout. Service was exceptional as well.  Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"First of all, get reservations because we tried to get in here for weeks. It was well worth the wait, but seriously, book ahead. One of my best restaurant experiences in Phoenix so far, for so many reasons.   Star 1 for not having to park my car! I am ALL ABOUT complimentary valet parking, it was so nice to drive up to the door and hand over my keys.  Star 2 for service. Our waitress was genuinely friendly and super knowledgable about the menu. She obviously had the wine menu memorized and knew which ones were organic (I don't really care about organic wine as long as it has alcoholic in it, but I'm still impressed) and where they were from. My family had never been to North before and she brought us some grilled bread to try too. Which brings us to:  Star 3 for food quality! They make their own pasta and bread in house. And everything tasted fresh and was plated beautifully.   Star 4 was for food taste. Because damn, it was all good.  Star 5 for atmosphere. My family is not the 'sit around and enjoy each other' kinda family. We go out, we eat, we leave. This is the kind of place you want to spend some time hanging out, enjoy your wine, and sit a while. The food wasn't brought out super quickly but that was actually okay because then we had some time between appetizers and entrees.   Well done, Fox Restaurants."}
{"text":"*****REVIEW UPDATE:  GREAT EXPERIENCE!****  Below was a review from a dining experience at NoRTH Italia.  They really do care about these reviews because the GM Cole contacted me via email and we spoke personally.  He listened to my concerns and said, \"Your feedback is how we improve.  We need this!  I'm so sorry it happened and we'd like to show you how we really treat our guests!\"   Cole invited us back and we had an GREAT EXPERIENCE!  The service and food were totally on point!  The scallops were done to perfection! Every person staff person was terrific.  They made the birthday celebration a special evening from beginning to end.   Their attention to detail and professionalism was evident ~ flowed smoothly on a very busy Saturday night.    Cole and his team totally turned a bad situation around. So many other businesses may not bother acknowledging a poor review. At NoRTH Italia, they welcomed the opportunity to fix a problem(s) and create a long term customer.  Although they are new in town, they certainly understand HOW customer service is done. CONGRATULATIONS and THANK YOU!!  Looking forward to our next NoRTH Italia dining experience!  ****************************************************************************************** Horrible Experience  We've been here several times and the service is inconsistent to say the least.   Today, was way beyond inconsistent!   They had seated two huge parties one of 35 and the other of 20. They offered to seat us outside on the patio with a heater that took about 15 minutes to light.  Our server never showed up while other tables around us were being waited on.  After going to the host, one showed up and she was very nice and did her best.  We had our food checked on - it didn't show up either.  Other parties seated long after us were eating.  Finally, my french toast arrived along with our other meals.  Mine was awful ~ barely grilled on one side.    The manager did come over to our table (once because the server told him, another time because we flagged him down).  Their response both times was \"let me check with the kitchen and see what's going on.\"  Even after he saw my uncooked meal, his concern was bringing it back to the kitchen so \"they could see it.\"  How about asking if you could make me something else?   NOTE TO NORTH ITALIA STAFF:  GUESTS ARE HERE TO ENJOY A MEAL AND HAVE A GREAT EXPERIENCE.  WE ARE NOT HERE TO WORK OUT YOUR OPERATIONAL ISSUES!  Things can and do happened.  As long time residents of LV we've had our share of good and bad restaurants.  It's ALL about how you recover and fix the experience.  In my opinion, and that of another tables seated near us having similar issues today, this place has a couple of issues: 1) The front-end staff (host, managers) are young and inexperienced for this type of an establishment.  They're trying to give off an upbeat, hip vibe which is great.  HOWEVER, that needs to be done with an experienced, professional staff.   As another guest table said, \"they need more grey hair running this place; They're kids.\"  2)  Again, from an experience standpoint, who would book two large parties at the same time, without adding staff?  This place isn't that big!  People can have large parties,  but how about staggering the timing?  How about adding staff? How about a private room like other restaurants in town?  The situation today sacrificed a ton of customer service due to poor planning on their part.  We get that you are new and want the exposure and business.  Our experience today (and another during the holidays)  clearly speaks to North Italia needing work in several areas.  They may be busy now, but if this continues, their guest won't continue putting up with inconsistent and bad experiences. Their are simply too many other choices in town."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant in the valley. Great for lunch or dinner. Nice patio area. Good service. Trendy enough without being over the top. I took a grandmother type here & she enjoyed herself & then I held my sister's bachelorette party dinner here & everyone enjoyed themselves. With that sort of audience appeal, I can't give them anything other than five stars."}
{"text":"Modern and sleek.  Though their menu is short it goes a long way.  Happy hour all day long on Sunday with a $10  charcuterie board that is huge and can fill two people up in no time.   Haven't tried the pizza yet but it did smell amazing, so I'm having that next time for sure.  The bar has nothing special or out of the ordinary...  all the domestic beers as well as some craft ones.  Definitely a great place to come hang out and watch Sunday golf."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the meal, had the gnocchi with braised short ribs...very tasty.  Place was packed but they found a spot for us in the back outside which was actually nicer than sitting inside in my opinion."}
{"text":"Dinner Oct 1   What a fantastic restaurant!   Everything I ordered was incredible.  Fresh, tasty, flavorful.   Loved the atmosphere (hip, cool, fun, friendly), the small menu (do what you do well!), and the selections (which covered just about all of our needs!)   Kale Salad - best I have every had.   The Meatballs were awesome!   The Chef's board as well loved by all.   Entrees were CRAZY GOOD & Desert was top of the line.   I cant speak highly enough of the food here.  I cant think of one negative thing, seriously!   If in the area, it is worth the trip!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale! Some of the best Italian food you will ever have, along with great service and drinks. We frequent this location and we are never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love this place ! Beautiful outdoor covered seating and their happy hour menu is the best ! Pizza and a whole bottle of wine for $20 . Meat and cheese boards for $10. Great food and environment !"}
{"text":"Our server Tracy was the GREATEST! She treated us to free Zucca chips when she learned it was our first visit. I was blown away with the Bolognese and the Short Ribs entree, which I split with my boyfriend. The Sangria was also outstanding! Boozey and sweet, but easy to drink ;) I can't say enough good things about this place - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I started this evening off with a negative star rating as they dropped the ball getting waiters or waitresses and we waited for over 21 minutes to get service started. But the food was incredible - Betsy the poor waitress who got us after the wait was excellent and the service from her and management was over and above. They took care of everything, so much that I was totally compelled to rewrite my initial review of North!!!!!! I am more than happy and will recommend coming here and enjoying the food and service!!!!! Thank you management and Betsy!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was there last friday food was good but service was bad i waited over an 1 to get my pizza i order the pig and some pasta for me and my wife i dont see why the food would take that long when you have 7 cooks on the line they were more focus on doing preo than putting great food out for the guest very bad experience"}
{"text":"North is delicious! I don't know of many places that have gluten free pizza but North does and it's the best. Great wines and great environment"}
{"text":"North is probably one of my favorite Fox restaurants (next to Blanco... duh). I came in recently to celebrate my friend's birthday and everything was fabulous, as usual! The staff was friendly, adorable ambiance, and the food was amazing. ***Warning - you will leave North extremely stuffed. It's probably because the food is so dang good that I ALWAYS over-eat here... And I mean always. BUT it's always worth it.   This time around I ordered the Chicken Parm. If you're a Chicken Parm fan.... You have got to get this, no questions asked. It is sooooo yummy. I love that they pair it with a creamy Parmesan pasta dish on the side, as opposed to traditional pasta with marinara (this is the best part). All and all, North is the perfect place to celebrate any special occasion and catch up with friends!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place but was disappointed with the whole experience. Service was slow - the bus boy finally came over, apologized for my waiter being busy and brought me water. I was underwhelmed by the menu but ordered the bacon and egg pizza. It was ok but lacked flavor. I doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"North is really good and really nice, but it's a bit to pricey for my liking. The atmosphere is pretty, but because I was with a large group we were sat outside where you hear and see everything that is going on in Kierland.  I also felt like we were the only people under thirty five. The food was good and our waiter was nice, but I'd rather spend a chunk of change and go all out at The Olive Garden! Haha!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  I was a little nervous walking up to this place. We were starving. It was jam packed. And, I was sure we would have a crazy long wait. I was wrong. We were greeted and seated right away.  The restaurant was clean & bright with a bit of that industrial feel. Our server, Tyler, came over right away and took our drink order. We weren't given any kind or bread or anything. I don't know if it was a fluke or if this is something they just don't do. Our drinks took a bit of time to arrive. Not long enough that we were getting upset, but long enough to notice it. I felt like this wasn't because the service was lacking, but more a result of how busy they were.  We had planned to order pizza, but other menu items had us at hello so we opted for 2 entrées. My husband ordered the Bolognese ($18) and subbed  Rigatoni. I opted for the Red Wine Braised Short Ribs ($26). Both were excellent! The Short ribs we flavorful & tender. Served with Marscarpone Polenta, Swiss Chard, Carrots, & Fingerling Potatoes. The accompaniments were as delicious as the ribs themselves. I'm not a huge polenta fan, but this dish made me want to lick my plate!  For dessert, we had the Bombolini ($7) which are served with a vanilla anglais & lemon curd.  Again, not a dish I would normally gravitate to, but it was calling to me and I'm glad it did. These little donuts were light and lovely. The perfect happy ending to our meal.  I'm already planning my next visit to North Italia! I am excited to try some of their pizzas, especially the Prosciutto w/ fig & goat cheese and the Bacon & Egg w/ roasted potato, garlic confit, & rosemary. I'm, also, looking forward to the Zucca Chips & the Arancini.  North Italia has a great vibe. The food is excellent & service is laid back and friendly. They are in a great location, and clearly the word is out! My biggest complaint about this place is that it is WAY across town for me so I can't go nearly as often as I would like."}
{"text":"Another fine experience at a Fox Group restaurant.  We had the opportunity to eat dinner here during restaurant week, which gave us the chance to sample a total of three appetizers (yes there were three of us), and two desserts (yes, we doubled up on one).  The Arancini (stuffed fried mushroom risotto) was unique and flavorful.  The bruschetta was usually excellent.  And the chef's board of cheese, meats, etc. was a delight to share. We all opted for the Atlantic salmon entrée in an attempt to be \"healthy.\"  The fish was well prepared and the horseradish gremolata was unique in a fabulous way.  The olive oil cake was delicious though I didn't have room to finish it.  The salted caramel budino was out of this world.  I didn't think it would be my kind of dessert, but I had to expand my small taste into several bites. The ambiance is casual and friendly; we ate out on the patio.  Service is good.  Another \"go to\" place!"}
{"text":"Really good food and the server was excellent!!!price point is spot on.... wine list nice and the ambience makes you feel welcome"}
{"text":"I was visting Phoenix for the night and having dinner with my friend who lives in Arcadia.  I loved the look of this restaurant, which is very cool but left unimpressed with the food.  It was hoppin' on a Wednesday night and we luckily grabbed the only two open seats at the inside bar.  I had eyed someone's salad and immediately thought that is what I will be ordering.   We started off with drinks.  I really liked the creativity with their drink menu. KD had the midnight shandy ($9.5) which she enjoyed.  Shandies are an interesting concept, incorporating beer and booze. It was so hot out that a nice light white wine sounded good to me.  I went with the vino di tavola- white.  A nice pinot grigio ($5).   We had the grilled summer squash ($7) for our starter.  There are yellow raisins included in a major way on this squash.  Raisins are not my thing and it's not mentioned on the menu about the raisins  but it was a tasty app.  I would've never gotten it though, had I been aware that raisins were in my near future.  I attempted to talk KD into splitting that salad I spied with me and also sharing the ricotta gnocchi but she did not take the bait.  She informed the gnocchi is very good but she wasn't in the mood for a heavy meal.  I ordered the casa salad ($8) and KD ordered the pork belly($12). The pork belly was very fatty so I passed on having a bite.  My casa salad was dreadful.  I was super duper disappointed.  It had burnt grilled bread on top.  When this was pointed out to our server, she had another plate of grilled bread brought out to us.  The salad had a strong, unappealing flavor.  Perhaps it was simply an off night for the house salad?  I love salads and Fox restaurants have some amazing salads. This was not one of them. I love my Sam Fox restaurants as much as the next person but this one was not a highlight for me."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour! trying to enjoy the last of the patio weather as its so awesome and enjoyable here! Staff is always friendly, food is always awesome!"}
{"text":"Went to have an early Dinner . Really really loved every bit of it ! It was early and the sun was still out . Beautiful decor (appealing tables and comfortable sturdy chairs) with a wall of wine and a decent bar space . The huge mirror made the place seem even bigger . The lighting looked like it would be so cool at night -Large teardrop glass to give a great glow . Smaller lighting was above as an addition.   The kitchen is open . Our server was outstanding- just enough engagement , completely pleasant. The food came out super fast ...like lightening fast .   Didn't order traditional dinner - went for a bunch of appetizers . The mussels were delicious- garlicky buttery broth with salami ,toasted bread and herbs . The chefs board was also crazy good - cheese ,meat,almonds,asparagus with a slight Asian flavor, bread,roasted pepper and a flavorful fruity jelly . Next was grilled to perfection artichokes - garlicky with grated cheese ,herbs and aioli ,wow ..didn't even need the aioli. Lastly a great Margherita pizza . We tried to save some for home ...well, that didn't happen .   Had a sangria too - super tasty . I'd imagine this place could have a lot of extra background noise as it gets packed - I wouldn't let that deter you . If you want a lot of quite time and soft speaking go early . Overall great energy ,great food and awesome service ."}
{"text":"The beverage menu read; 'Cheap Cans $2.00'.   Cheap cans, as I incorrectly surmised was not an older woman named Waynette, whose once youthful 34D's had now fallen victim to gravity. Well, gravity and her recently deceased husband, Sid, overly-motorboating them throughout the years.  Lucinda, with no place to call home save for a stolen shopping cart, is waved in from the alley by your server to flash her 42 longs at you. And for all of two bucks! Boy, was I ever wrong.  Actually, Cheap Cans, as the server informed, is whatever they feel like serving on any given day. Some days Red Stripe tall-boys, others, PBR. Last night it was tall boys.  Someone in our party ordered appys, but I have no idea what it was called. I was too busy ruminating on the whole cheap cans thing. It was ten bucks and it had olives, cheese, pickled peppers, salami, hot salami, crusty bread and hot peanuts.  Two tall boys in, I dispensed with any graciousness and just started grabbing at anything i could get my hands on before the others beat me to it.   I suppose this is one reviewer's way of saying it was damned tasty stuff, whatever it was."}
{"text":"I'm always weary of pizza places in upscale parts in Scottsdale but I was taken away by the food fare options & plethora of bubbly spirits to choose from here.   It's a charming street side pizza parlor which makes everything from scratch, from the marinara sauce to the mozzarella cheese. It's delicious traditional Italian food at its finest!

{"text":"We met friends for dinner here on a Saturday night and it was definitely a neighborhood favorite, they were busy!  I thought the experience was okay, but I was not as impressed as others before me seem to have been....I was looking forward to the food, I had checked out Yelp ahead and had even bookmarked the restaurant previously. We had the Chefs board and the truffle garlic bread to start. Both were good. The truffle garlic bread was the star of the night! I would recommend this appetizer for sure.  Dinner for me was the \"House specialty\" Bolognese. Not impressed at all.... sorry... Chef Marc's Bolognese is FAR superior!!! I love pasta and didn't finish my entree...  My husband liked his Short Rib Radiatori. So did our friends at the table.  It really was for my a three star \"A-Okay\"..."}
{"text":"Was able to get a taste if their new brunch menu. Wow. Just as good as their lunch and dinner!   We started off with their red rooster Italian style Bloody Mary. It was delicious and had parmesian cheese sprinkled in it - weird at first but adds a great salty bit!  We had some baked French toast with vanilla syrup, homemade whipped cream and fresh berries. We also had a great parfait with Greek yogurt sweetened with honey and vanilla, crunchy granola and fresh berries.  On came the heavier courses of a veggie scramble and a short rib hash. The veggie scramble was my least favorite but that's only because I'm not a huge veggie in my eggs kinda girl. The hash though- wow. Everyone's favorite. If you've ever had their gnocchi then you've had their braised short rib and it's amazing.   Finish today off with a chat with the chef and a tutorial on how to make a tortoloni (yup not a tortiloni and I'm sure my spelling is off for both) then you can say I started my day in a pretty bad ass manner."}
{"text":"Since my last review we have dined here several times and enjoyed it every time. The food and service just seem to get better every visit. Our last meal here a few days ago was another memorable one.   It was a hot day but since the misters were on we sat out on the patio and managed to stay nice and cool throughout our meal.   My husband had the meatball sandwich which was delicious! The same sumptuous meatballs they serve with their spaghetti dish - a big favorite of mine.  I tried the 'not your typical' chicken lasagna which was also very tasty....lots and lots of spinach and mushrooms.  For dessert they did not have what I ordered so they bought our desserts for us! We were very impressed by that.  As always a great experience : )"}
{"text":"The only reason I visit this restaurant is the food. Service to be honest is a hit or miss. Couple of times it was ok, but again it went down the other two times we were here. I also don't understand their bread policy. Is it complimentary? Sometimes we get it, sometimes we dont. If its not for the food, specially their funghi pizza, i would give it a pass."}
{"text":"Everything was great food and service. The issue is I sat down at 7:42 and didn't leave the restaurant till 9:40. The food took so long to go out. They made up for it with how good it taste but no one should ever have to wait that long for food to come out"}
{"text":"Love it! The ambiance was so chill and welcoming and service was on point.  Came here with my husband for Sunday brunch, I was not feeling to good as I was recovering from a massive hangover so I needed food ASAP.  As appetizers we ordered the seasonal soup which had potato, sausage and kale soup and we also ordered the prosciutto bruschetta.  The soup was so good and comforting and the bruschetta was on point too.  For my entree I decided to order the Bolognese and my husband had the Squid Ink Mafaldine.  My bolognese very good and the pasta was cooked perfectly (BTW this pasta cured my hangover).  My husband's pasta was really good too, the flavors were really unique and tasty.  For dessert we had the hazelnut torta, very good as well.  Can't wait to go back and try some pizza and other pasta dishes."}
{"text":"get the butchers plate? I want to say thats what its called, I dont think its on the menu. but its a platter of all sorts of yummy things that they are serving that day like meats and cheeses and olives and spreads.  they also dont have sangria on their menu but they'll make it for you and its pretty tasty.   most importantly though is order a side of olive oil with whatever you get (for pizza crust, bread, etc.) Its literally heaven-sent. I would bathe in it."}
{"text":"My soon to be wife and I love this place! Talk about FRESH pasta! This place is delicious and you're treated very well here. Food is great and the staff is amazing! The open kitchen is nice to look at as your dinner is being made from scratch! Nothing is frozen here!"}
{"text":"I don't really like Italian food.... there, I said it, it's true. You can begin submitting your hate mail. When anyone asks the question, \"What do you want to eat?\" Italian will rarely, if ever, come out of my mouth. However, that may have been changed by North Frattoria Italiana.   Many of my Phoenix Yelp friends have been to and speak highly of North. I just realized that I can literally walk there from my home. At times, I'm completely oblivious to my surroundings. All this time, North has been sitting here, and I haven't taken advantage of it. Well, today that has all changed.  We came here tonight because my offspring loves Italian food... He may not actually be mine. I'm kidding, he's mine, bought and paid for.    The first thing I noticed about North was the setting. Unlike the typical Mamma Mia... Ay you's guys... Ooh La La (actually I think that last one's French) atmosphere, North has a farm house feel. The staff was even wearing plaid shirts and jeans. I liked that laid back feel. I'm a country boy at heart so the farm-esque tone was comforting.  We started our food journey with the calamari and a seasonal chef board: The calamari was okay. The breading was a bit heavy and I thought it took away from the flavor and feel of the calamari. It's not something I would get again.  The seasonal chef board was good. It consisted of brussel sprouts, squash, asparagus, mushrooms, some kind of cheese and a few slices of really good bread. I liked it, but it was more for my lady. The veggies fixation is her thing.  For my main dinner I got the Ricotta Gnocchi. It's braised beef short rib with gnocchi served in a horseradish crema and wilted arugula. I love short rib, but I'm not a huge fan of horseradish. I asked our server her opinion and she assured me it all complimented each other. She was absolutely right. It was excellent. The short rib was very tender and the crema, meat and gnocchi all worked perfectly. Excellent.  I could have ended the meal there and been content, but we didn't. For dessert we ordered the Tiramisu and Bombolini:   The tiramisu is served in a glass container rather than in sliced cake form, and is covered in playful little chocolate balls. I liked the presentation. It was cool looking and tasted great.   The bombolini are Italian donuts. They had cinnamon and sugar on the surface and were plated on a lemon/vanilla mascarpone pudding-like bed. It all worked well together and my son, who is a bit of a \"donut expert\", thought they were very good.   Overall, this was a wonderful experience. Everyone walked away happy and I found an Italian place that I could see myself frequenting... for that, 5 stars is in order."}
{"text":"I've been to North multiple times and it is at the top of my list.  Especially to take family and friends to because they always are consistently good... for service... ambience... and of course delicious food and drink.  They have a super tasty tequila drink that I recommend... and the pesto pasta dish with chicken is my absolute fave!"}
{"text":"Finally made it over to NoRTH the other night with some friends and had a really great overall experience. The place has been non stop packed since it opened, so I was worried we'd wait forever on a Saturday night but they took our number and told us they would text us (that's new!) when our table was ready. We walked across the street for a drink and before we knew it, text received.  Now while our overall dining experience was positively fabulous, there are a few things that have irked me since, namely, the price as compared to the quantity of food received. The portions are small, but the good kind of small where you don't over-stuff yourself with whatever you're eating. Where portion size is a serious problem however, is with their cocktails. 10 bucks for 6 ounces of booze?!?!?! Super weak. Now in their defense, they had cans of Miller High Life available for 3 bucks apiece but it wasn't really a high life type of evening.   The salads were refreshing. The gnocchi with braised short rib was RIDICULOULSY tasty and the raviolini was excellent as well, however the pizza was good but not amazing. The 2 deserts we shared (holy shit those donuts bro) were also excellent.   Overall, an impressive setup with great food that can be reasonably priced if you order correctly and have your cocktails someplace else. We will definitely be back here, in fact, I think I've talked myself into an extra star. Well done NoRTH!"}
{"text":"Food is good. But guess what? The service is bad - We won't come back. It's the second time. And that's the most important in restaurant. It seems like this is a new restaurant and you feel it every day there, Maybe it's a first restaurant for that owner. It takes them long time to come and serve you, They don't know to answer questions like which of the sauces contain chicken or beef broth , Everybody say something different. It takes long time for food to come. Really dissap  I did contact in private message 5 days ago - No answer, no comment ."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by some friends of ours. We are only here for a few days so wanted to pick special restaurants for each night we'll we are here. I went on yelp to read some of the reviews. Was a little concerned with some people saying there was a snotty attitude. We did not find that at all! We were greeted right away when we walked in and sat at our table which we had reservations for. As soon as we were seated a smiling young girl named Sam came over to greet us and brought us a cocktail menu. I told her what I was thinking about getting and she said that was one of her favorites!  She was super friendly and instantly changed our whole attitude about the restaurant. Soon after that our waitperson Jamie came over.  She was very's friendly also. See had great knowledge of the menu and seemed like she had all the time the world to help us. (Even though the restaurant was packed) We had the zucca chips and calamari...then a salad and Bolognese and my husband had STROZZAPRETI. Both were fantastic!  I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've passed by this place multiple times while in Boca Park and I am so happy to finally try it. Such a cute little place. It definitely has a more a contemporary feel but with home-y feeling. I was there for Sunday brunch so it was packed.   I ordered their breakfast wrap and my girls and I shared a pitcher of their red sangria. The breakfast wrap was so good! I literally inhaled it the moment I took my first bite of it. It had Italian sausage, mushrooms, smoked mozzarella, scrambled eggs, and roasted pepper. It came with this cream sauce on the side. I'm not entirely sure what it was but it complemented the wrap really well. It was so nicely made, it wasn't messy or greasy, and it was filling. The perfect amount of flavor and I was impressed that their was a good amount of sausage and mushrooms. Other breakfast wraps or burritos I've had in the past consisted mostly of scrambled eggs and not much of anything else. So this had a good ratio of everything. The sangria was nice and refreshing and between 4 girls, we were able to have 2 glasses each out of the pitcher. The pitcher is $28 which I feel is a deal instead of each girl getting bottomless mimosas.   The service was great and timely! Our service was very accommodating and sweet. I will definitely be back to try their other menu items!"}
{"text":"This is my place place to eat when I lived in North Scottsdale. I usually go there for lunch and always get the farmer's salad. Their salad is made with seasonal veggies and the white balsamic dressing they use is delicious. During dinner time, I get the braised beef short rib. It is so delicious.   I would say the only food I'm not very fond of is their pizzas. The pizza is not horrible, it's just meh. The toppings are similar to those of a take out pizza place like pizza hut."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful night here.  All the servers were friendly with great suggestions.  We tried the calamari, chicken pesto pasta, Short rib pasta, margarita pizza, tiramisu and Italian coffee.  Everything was delicious, Short rib pasta and calamari were my faves.  Can't wait to go back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"North is a great spot.  One of the best Italian restaurants in PHX.    The zucca chips are a must as an appetizer.   Also recommend the artichoke and cauliflower.    From a main course the pizza is to die for, 100% recommend.  Also the burrata tortelloni is a great meal.   Bon appetite"}
{"text":"I genuinely love this place! My boyfriend and I came for dinner on a Saturday night and the food was so so good. We didn't make a reservation and the place was packed, but we only ended up waiting about 30 mins. This place has a beautiful ambiance like somewhere on the Strip without actually being on the Strip. It's located right across the street from Boca Park near Honey Salt.  For food we started with the Arancini. They were perfectly crispy on the outside and stuffed with goodness. The sauce is really what made this one a winner though, super rich and delicious taste. (4/5) As an entree I had the vegetarian friendly Burrata Tortellini. The broth, omg, SO good! I ate every single piece of this dish and loved all of it. (5/5) My boo had the chicken parmesan which he said was phenomenal. I was able to try some of his pasta on the side which was super tasty. I would get the penne just on its own as an entree if I could. We then topped the meal off with some tiramisu (5/5). I loved the crunchy bites on the top and the flavors were very good.   I really cannot get enough of this place. They make all of their pastas and dough in house and it shows in the tastes. I will be back here again soon I'm sure and recommend it to others as well."}
{"text":"I've visited this location a few different times hoping to get better results.  Alas, its a no go.  Its always incredibly busy, very loud and the tables are small. (They have a few bigger, but apparently if you're only on a date, small is the way to go. I was afraid of knocking my drink off the table.  The food is alright. The artichokes give me the feeling they cooked them earlier and then microwaved it before they brought it.  The grilled asparagus didn't seem fresh at all and actually reminded me of when I forget I have asparagus and pull it out of the fridge a couple days before its going to be bad.  They did however make the portion bigger with the strozzapreti, which I appreciated when dealing out $16 for a pasta dish.  The service was really slow even when the room began to clear out.  (We ended up being there for about 1.5)  Oh, and word of warning wear shoes with serious tread. I've been there wearing heels twice and have nearly fell because of the floor.  Beast seating is outside because you escape from the busy, noisy and crowded inside however, keep in mind you're in the middle of a shopping center so you will have cars driving by, and people all around you. Its not a horrible place, I'm not absolutely against it, but its really not worthy money they charge. My date had some sort of steak which he said was decent, the sauteed spinach wasn't very good and tasted canned and the crispy Italian potatoes were alright.  He said \"It was decent, but not worth $28. He also said by the outside he expected a lot more from this place and the decor inside he wasn't a fan of at all.   BTW, Vegan in Yelp listing? Almost everything on the menu has meat, butter, or cheese on it. I wouldn't call this place Vegan its barely Vegetarian.  This was my last try of this location of NoRTH I've had better service and food at the Glendale location. I'd say, save your money and head some place with a little more class, faster service and better food."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Great service, great food! Zucchini chips and chefs board we're tasty. Brought Mom for Mother's Day and both pastas we had were fantastic! It made a great Mother's Day stop for dinner! Pricey but worth it! Reserved online, got valeted and seated with zero wait."}
{"text":"I ate at North Italia as research for a potential project. The food was fresh, tasteful and fulfilling.  I ordered a margherita pizza, bolongnese and dessert!! The pizza was a little over cooked and had burned edges but was tasteful. A little a less sauce would have been perfect. The bolongnese was a first for me so I can't compare it to other places I've ate at. The sauce was hearty and a little too salty for likening, but was delicious. Their pastas are made fresh. The kitchen was opened and the sous chef and manager checked in on how we liked the food. The patrons there was a diverse crowd. The location is in a residential neighborhood, but behind a busy street. Be sure to bring tip money because their parking lot is complimentary valet. This restaurant was not busy during my visit however has a lot of potential. This place would do well if it was in a better location and seen from the Main Street, not behind a storage facility. It was our waitress's first day and she was so sweet and knew her dishes."}
{"text":"From the greeting to the presentation amazing!!  Our server Shelby was one of the best servers I've had in the Arcadia district to date!  Amazing timing,  amazing suggestions.   And her assertiveness  was welcomed.  I appreciate good service. Shelby was great.  I have managed and served and bartended in many fine dining restaurants...  And bars.  But by far Shelby is a gem.  Every movement was calculated with great customer service and connection with us as customers.  Food was amazing had the Italian sandwich Shelby recommended...  Loved it.  My mother had the chicken Parmesan and pasta, both of which to die for.  Definitely recommend this place. We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place for both lunch and dinner.  The entrees are reasonably priced an soooo soo good!  Very modern interior, good looking crowd, great service and tasty food...what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"We went to North Italia for the Valentine's Day prix fixe menu and really enjoyed it. They had a chanterelle mushroom ragout for the day that's not part of their regular menu, but it was really good (mascarpone polenta is aazing). We also tasted the arancini, which are basically stuffed rice balls; these had mushroom risotto stuffed with scamorza cheese, really tasty.  For the main course, I ordered the burrata tortelloni which was really good, great combination of pasta, mushroom, and swiss chard. My Valentine had the red wine glazed short rib, so he got to try the amazing mascarpone polenta along with some veggies. The meat was tender and flavorful. (Short rib is on their regular menu, but it's prepared a little differently.) It was nice that the appetizers and meal portions weren't too huge so you didn't walk away feeling stuffed (as can happen in Italian restaurants). For dessert, I tried the tiramisu, which was really good but a bit heavy on the cocoa powder. I think I accidentally inhaled a bit!  I'd say the salted caramel budino is even better, even for chocolate addicts like me. The service was great and we felt like we had our own space even with the Valentine's Day rush; we were at a communal table along with another couple but we were on opposite ends of a large table. They also had some prosecco-based cocktails which were pretty tasty. Would love to try this place again on a normal night."}
{"text":"North was previously recommended to me several times, so I honestly expected better, especially regarding their customer service. I went with a friend around lunch time on a weekday and although it wasn't at all busy, after being seated, it took a server over 10 minutes to greet us and take our drink order. Then, after receiving our check at the end of the meal, we were hoping to ask to have the check split, and it took over 20 minutes for our server to check back after dropping it off to allow us the opportunity to ask to have it split. However, although the service was mediocre, the food was good and the salted Carmel Gelato was exceptionally delicious. Overall, the experience was decent and while I wouldn't be opposed to returning, it probably wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming here and I just love it! We sat on the patio and I love the open-ness and airy atmosphere. I ordered the seasonal vegetable salad with salmon. I ordered it well done and it was flaky and so delicious. Paired with Brussel sprouts and butternut squash it was fantastic. My date ordered chicken Parmesan with a parmesan rigatoni side. I actually took more than one bite of his dish because it was so good, I couldn't help myself! The service was great, and my ice tea was always filled up. Overall, North is a fantastic casual dining atmosphere and I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"One of my customers brought me here. I ended up paying however. No problem he is a very important customer. Restaurant was bright open very clean. The bartender had to be in his late 40's...with a mo-hawk hair do, to each his own. I want to go back because I didn't have time to explore the menu. I know homemade Italian...I had the burger. It was highly recommended, and very delicious. Amazing place can't wait to take my wife."}
{"text":"Well everyone said to go here.... With my experience I can understand why! In fact I went twice in one week! Absolutely adored all things on the menu, great options for gluten free and delicious drinks! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great date spot!! Love the ambiance!!  It's a bit loud but it adds to the atmosphere. Staff are attentive and professional. Glasses never emptied. The food though! Oh my good the food was exceptional! My BF and I enjoyed every last bite. We started with calamari and meatballs as appetizers. Then had the short ribs and New York steak for dinner! The flavors were perfectly seasoned. Steaks cooked to perfection.   A must try! Do not forget to order the calamaris! Thank me later ;)"}
{"text":"My wife and I love the Scottsdale location of North Italia and other Fox restaurants so have been excited about having our own in Summerlin. We went to opening night hoping for a great experience. They did not disappoint. Our food was excellent, the atmosphere outstanding. Our server, Oscar, was fantastic. Their happy hour offerings will quickly become a Vegas favorite. Can't wait to enjoy the outdoor patio on a warm evening."}
{"text":"I was extremely pleased about the food,service and atmosphere! Talk about top notch customer experience. We were promptly seated in a cozy booth next to the kitchen. Jennifer our friendly server was AMAZING! She was tentative but not over baring and would always check on us at the perfect time.  All the employees were prompt to help us out weather it was a food runner, server or buser. We started off with the Italian Farm salad, grilled artichoke and a bottle of Pinot Nero. The salad was DELICIOUS, i couldn't eat it fast enough. The grilled artichoke tasted wonderful but was on the messier side to eat (super juicy) For our entree we ordered the diver scallops.... SO GOOOOOD!  They were the biggest most tender scallops I've ever had, i have been craving them ever since we left! We had the donuts and a cappuccino for dessert..... again nothing but perfect! We regularly visit the Fox Concept Restaurants but North is by far our favorite. They go above and beyond the customer experience and the food has always been incredible."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant! We love to dine at many places and this one by far exceeds most places we have dined at. Absolutely amazing food and, service and ambiance! Can't wait to dine here again on our next trip to Arizona"}
{"text":"I love Fox Concepts....this was no exception! Customer service was on point, delicious food...three words \"braised...short rib...gnocchi..\" - that really says it all!"}
{"text":"Embarked on our usual happy hour recon routine and finally checked out NoRTH.  Really enjoyed it! The bartender, Kyle, was very attentive and helpful.  Have to agree with everyone on the Zucca chips.  We devoured them!  Not going to go wrong with any of the food choices for happy hour and the specialty drinks offer some cool choices also.  The regular menu is priced a little on the high side for us, but we will save a night to come back and try it!"}
{"text":"Perfect ! Thank you FOX Restaurant Group ? Delightful Happy Hour and excellent customer service . Welcome to the Neighborhood . Fig Pizza , great wine and now dessert  I will be back and back and back"}
{"text":"Fun location & adorable restaurant. Unfortunately our experience didn't start out so great-- we were told we'd have a table in 20 minutes, which turned into an hour. We checked in after 25 minutes. We were told '6 more minutes'. After an hour & asking one more time we got a table. I'm sure we were forgotten. Luckily we had a great waiter & the food was good. The pasta, meatballs, simple salad & truffle bread were all amazing!"}
{"text":"This place was one of the most pleasant surprises that I have had in awhile. My family and I were looking for a good restaurant for dinner and I pulled up Open Table on the hotels webpage that we were staying at, and this place was one of the suggestions. I wanted to try it because I am Northern Italian and I was hoping that this was going to be (at least) decent...it was great! First, we made reservations for 6pm and got seated right away, the hostess was happy and smiling when she seated us and the server came right to our table for our drink order and meal suggestions. We ordered our food and it came out super quick. My wife and daughter ordered the chicken parm, my younger daughter ordered the pasta with meatballs and I ordered the pesto. Everything, and I mean everything, was fresh and sooo good that I wish I would not have gotten full so I could've eaten more. This place is great from the valet, to the people that work in the restaurant, to the ambiance (the place is incredibly clean), to the fresh and tasty food, to the fair pricing...I will absolutely come back."}
{"text":"Very authentic and delicious food. The mussels are cooked to perfection and the bread is amazing as well"}
{"text":"I feel bad for saying this as I feel I may be disrespecting my other reviews for restaurants that serve Osobuco, but........  oh... what the heck!!!!  friggin' A!!!!!  the best osobuco!!!! served with tasty creamy polenta.  try one of their frizzante cocktails: prosecco with fruit puree of your choice.   pass on the chicken lasagna  The service was fantabulous!!!  Seating arrangements can be better but overall I was pretty satisfied."}
{"text":"I recently ate here with a group of friends and was underwhelmed.  I had a hard time choosing what I wanted to eat and finally settled on a bowl of pasta (Bucatini) with meatballs.  I thought the meatballs were overcooked and hard as rocks, the frozen turkey meatballs I microwave at home are better. Nice atmosphere and great, friendly service though.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing or maybe I don't like Northern Italian food."}
{"text":"First off, Paul you are the man! Seriously. You made my night.   This is not my first time visiting North. I get excited anytime I get to go here. Had a wonderful dinner and couldnt resist but to share my experience. This place has incredible service surrounded by a perfect balance of home cooking and a beautiful night out on the town. Its very reasonably priced in my opinion and I haveny had anything on the menu that I havent liked. Althought the bolognese is the best.   Danielle is our favorite server and if youre going anytime soon, try their Apple Bourbon cocktail for a perfect balance of fall and winter.   You guys rock. See you again soon!"}
{"text":"Not impressive. Our waiter was a total tool, a young kid who pretty much ignored us most of our meal.  Im not sure if he was new or just dumb.  1. Neglected to bring us the complimentary bread. 2. We requested lemons to go along with our waters, failed there. 3. Our drinks were not a priority of his, chatting up other waiters was more important. 4. We ordered appetizers for our table of 4 to share, he neglected to mention that appetizers would only be enough for each of us to taste a small morsel. 5. Never came by during our meal or after to check on us. 6. Hald of our pizza was burned on the crust. Normally I would chalk this up as an \"it happens\" but it seeing how the rest of our experience was going I was peeved. 7. We waited for a good 15 minutes after finishing our meal for him to finally come by and ask if we were ready for the check. Then we waited another 20 minutes, deciding finally to go ahead and flag down the manager to run the card.  We did express to the manager, Danny that our meal wasnt quite what we had expected. He listened and did seem genuinely concerned, even stepping outside the restaurant as we were leaving and offering us complimentary dessert.  Nice effort on his part, but the whole conversation with him was a little awkward.  Overall, you can probably guess that I think the service was terrible, and to be honest for the price the portions were meager.   I had heard good reviews about this place and was eager to try it, but based upon my recent experience I dont think I will be returning."}
{"text":"An exquisite and unique taste to urban Italian dinning. This is not your run of the mill from Italy Italian. It's a splash and thrust of new flavor and flavor to light your taste bugs on fire. This place never fails."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and was very happy!  Fair prices for good food.  Had the scallops with risotto and it was great.  Scallops were perfectly cooked and not over seasoned.  Risotto was just a shad over cooked for me but the flavor was great.   Nice attentive service to top it off.   + half price bottles of wine on Sunday :)"}
{"text":"Everything was great here tonight. Good service great food with unique flavors. Saturday night entertainment on the commons was an unexpected bonus. Try the grilled artichoke appetizer and the gnocchi with braised ribs was excellent.. I'll come back."}
{"text":"Didn't realize how great HH is at North! We ordered the $20 bottle and board- choice between a pizza, bruschetta or chefs board and bottle of wine. We opted for the red bottle and tomato bruschetta, as my friend is vegan. The red bottle is a light red- I'd compare as a cab/Pinot Noir blend. The white is Pinot Grigio. Pizzas looked incredible- would likely veer that route if (and when) we go back. Also ordered the zucchini chips $3 on happy hour.. smell and taste like fair food- highly not as healthy as they sound, but absolutely delicious. Jill also loved her soup- it was minestrone in nature- didn't pay attention to the name, hit had spinach and mostly beans- health and vegan friendly! They have happy hour all day Sunday and offer half off bottles Mon and Tues 3-6pm; if you can't make it in, Greenhouse offers half off bottles on Wednesday next door! Thank you Fox Restaurants for never failing to disappoint!"}
{"text":"Can not believe this is a chain. Some of the best pasta I have ever had and I am Italian."}
{"text":"I couldn't be happier that vegas is getting more cute places like this!   I have been several times since opening. Brrunch and Dinner and I have to say I have enjoyed both equally. For brunch the veggie scramble and baked french toast are to die for. For dinner I am a fan of Bolognese and the meatballs.   The only complaint I have is that several times I have gone to the bar to grab a glass of wine before getting sat and the bartenders arent very attentive. I had to wait 15 minutes (real time, not an exageration) for the bartender to even acknowledge that we had even sat down directly infront of her ... Closing our tab was the same time frame.   Table service has always been great and the waiters/waitresses are very friendly."}
{"text":"Made reservations for two tables online and the tables were separate, however, the manager was so wonderfully accommodating and found us a table for 13 as the original plan was for 16.  The staff was friendly and the food was phenomenal! It was a Birthday dinner and our waitress checked on us precisely at the right times. I ordered the daily pizza which was the Brussel sprout and pistachio pizza; perfect combination of flavors. Dessert was the right amount of sweet, not too rich but also not an average dessert. I will definitely go back and encourage  others to partake of their menu and take advantage of the happy hour!"}
{"text":"Been hearing a lot about this place and try it out today I order my typical Bruscheta, Pasta with tomato and basil with added goats cheese of course Perino on the side. Good job Chealsea good customer service and she nailed my pasta order. Definitely I will be back and tell my pasta loving friends about this place it is crowded though so be ready to wait to be seated if your showing up as a group or better yet make a reservation."}
{"text":"We love coming here any day of the week. The bar is great if we want to get a quick bite and the patio is really cool for dining. It does get busy with a wait so make sure to call ahead. We ordered our dinner for pick up today as we have to pack for our trip tomorrow and got home and realized one of our dishes was wrong. We were frustrated and called it in, politely of course. The manager hopped on the phone and without hesitation asked what we were expecting and is having it sent to us. We are pleasantly surprised by the great service tonight. Cherry on top of the great service we always get when we dine in!"}
{"text":"Super good food and awesome atmosphere. I've come a few times and love the food choices, there is something for everyone. Today I LOVED the grilled artichoke. Mussels were good, salads are fresh and unique. The bar is too small for the crowd which is annoying but also adds to the cool vibe so I would not trade the standing room only for the feeling of a crowd on a Saturday night. Love it."}
{"text":"I have waited a few days before I write this review. It was our first time for lunch for my foodie lunch group. First let me say that I called a few days (3) ahead to make reservations. I told them between 15-20 people and they refused to give us a reservation unless we could come after 3pm. Seriously? That doesn't work since we meet at 1pm each week at a new restaurant to review the food. I even offered to split up into 3-4 tables for their convenience. No go said the restaurant. OK. So decided to chance it at the door. So we all came and finally they said we could eat on the patio with the heaters turned on. That worked except it was 50 mile an hour winds and about 49 degrees that day.  The food was OK. I got ill on my portion of spaghetti and meatballs and the calamari was not good. Not sure if they spit in my food or not. Others had the ink pasta, Bolognese pasta, salads, pizza, calamari, sandwiches, etc. Very mixed impressions from our group. The waiter we had was very good but so rushed. Not sure how many other tables he was trying to take care of but he was pleasant and tried very hard. I would recommend only if you are coming with 2-3 people and then I would watch what I ordered."}
{"text":"ARE THE MANY 5-STAR RATINGS LEGIT?  Our group had a so-so experience at this loud, overpriced, undervalued venue.  $18 for a medium-sized bowl of barely-more-than-warm pasta?  Accompanied by nothing.  No bread, no salad, no vegetables.    The place has been open 6 weeks and the newbee local customers pack the place.  Will North Italia sustain a customer base?  Doubtful.  We enjoyed the food.  It was very good -- not exceptional.  A cast of twenty in the kitchen produced half our entrees after waiting 20 minutes.  The balanced arrived 27 minutes after ordering.  The service by M was defined by our 10% tip:  inattentive, slow to respond to a request, forgetful.    Not sure if a \"manager\" was around.  Not one person asked if we were enjoying our dinner.    And not sure if I will go back considering Olive Garden, Carraba's, Marc's Trattoria and others offer a similar if not better value and experience."}
{"text":"On the upside--when you order the scallops here, you get more than you would expect at any other restaurant.  On the downside--they were gritty.  :-(  The dessert (chocolate hazelnut cake & banana crepes) were amazing and perfect & the trio of hummos was excellent.  Unfortunately, my husbands salmon was so-so, at best.  The fish itself was OK, but it was sitting on this repulsively bland pile of something that constituted half the dish.  I think it might have been squash, but I can't even say for sure.    It's a great location, with a fun, busy atmosphere, so it's really disappointing that the food kind of misses the mark.  Or, at least, the food that we had missed the mark."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. I highly recommend! We had the funghi pizza gluten free which was absolutely delicious and crispy, the Tortellini and the Hazelnut torta. The waitress was extremely helpful in helping us choose the food and very friendly."}
{"text":"Almond crusted trout with potato au gratin. Scrumptious. Our waiter , Steve hit the perfect note with  his service."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, love the simple clean foods. The staff is always nice and the food is always fresh tasting. The restaurant has a great vibe and is perfect for small and large groups. Definitely sign up for the Fox Restaurant groups email and get the $10 off coupon valid for 2 weeks. The breakfast pizza with the egg, bacon, and potato is delicious. The zucchini chips are light and easy to snack on."}
{"text":"First time here tonight and let me say just wow!   Everything was very fast, from the food to the drinks. Had the calamari, bolognese, and the strawberry mascarpone dessert with an 8oz glass of Pinot noir.  Food was extremely flavorful and satisfying, portions were just right!   The only problem I had throughout the night was that the server repeatedly served us from behind (both my date and I were sitting on one side of the booth with our backs towards the expo line/kitchen). I always like to see my food/service/drinks served directly in front of me.  Other than that small problem the ambiance was perfect, the food was perfect and the night was perfect. Fantastic date spot and shall return.   5/5"}
{"text":"This is an update. I was contacted by a manager and tried to make it right so I finally came back tonight for a dinner date to give it a second shot! We ordered the chef's board and it was delicious. Then my husband ordered the short rib radiatori that was soooo good. I ordered the scallops again and they were perfect! They had all the toppings they did not have last time and there were 3 perfectly cooked scallops! Our server Mariah was super nice their iced tea was delicious. Nice casual date spot , with great customer service!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just ate here.  The food was really good. We had the spaghetti and meatballs. The sauce tasted fresh. We had the tiramasu for dessert, which was amazing. It had a unique flavor and texture that was delicious and not too sweet.   The main reason I'm not giving it 5 stars, is due to the restaurant being so warm. They need to add some fans or turn up the air conditioning. I'm someone who is typically cold in restaurants, so for me to be warm, I can only imagine how everyone else was feeling. Definitely worth trying and we would come again, but maybe when it's cooler outside n ;)"}
{"text":"New american style italian.  I enjoyed everything I had and the fact they had some real italian dishes mixed in w/ some italian with a new american twist or ingredients. Something for everyone here.  Espresso here is tasty as well and if your going to put italian in your name that is a must.  I don't recall what brand it is, I believe it is local not lavazza or illy. However I like that about the Fox chains. They are all dependably tasty, fresh and local inspired."}
{"text":"Came here for the soft opening and I will definitely return! Super cute Atmosphere and decor. Very friendly staff. We started off with the kale salad and it was a good portion. My boyfriend ordered the ckn parm and it was pretty good but the short rib pasta was Amazing, melt in your mouth deliciousness. Heard Sunday's will be half off bottles of wine and I'm pretty excited about that. Very open floor plan with a great patio! Thanks for the great dining experience! Will be back  :)"}
{"text":"Visited North for the first time on 03/26/14.  My wife works nearby, and I wanted to take her to lunch.  She suggested North because I like Italian food so much.  I can't wait to return to try other dishes!  North has done the impossible.  They got me to eat zucchini and like it.  I always swore that zucchini was not fit for human consumption.  They proved me wrong!  We started out w/ an order of the \"Zucca Chips\", deliciously thin sliced deep fried zucchini.    Do to it being my first time there, we decided to split 2 lunches.  We started w/ the Italian Farm salad.  Mixed greens, salami, cheese, roasted red peppers. olives, and  red onion.  I don't like raw onion in a salad, but I ate every morsel in my salad.  They tasted like they were marinated and did not have that sharp onion bite.    The other item we had was the Meatball Sandwich.  This was different than most restaurants, as it was served on a round roll, rather than a hoagie style roll.  The meatballs were very good and tasted like they had Italian sausage in the mixture; they were nicely complemented by the cheese, sauce, and tasty roll.  Accompanying the sandwich were some of the best potatoes that I have ever had in a restaurant.  They looked like they were par boiled whole, smashed and fried.  Very, very good, nice texture, and a great taste.  The nice thing is that they were not greasy looking or tasting, nor were they salted to death.  I have to mention that the service was very good.  The hostess, our server, and another server that was assisting ours were great.  They smiled and were welcoming and friendly.  No bad attitude whatsoever.  We told the server we were splitting the meals, and he had the kitchen split them so we didn't have to (nice touch!).    I have nothing negative to say about our visit to North.  The only detraction that I could mention would be the noise level; it was loud when the place started filing up.  Our bill was $36 before tip.  A little high for a midweek lunch, but not high when considering the quality of the food we had.  I usually don't say this about restaurants that are \"new\" to me, but I can't wait to return!."}
{"text":"Unbelievable service from the entire staff especially Tyler. Atmosphere is excellent and food is perfection. Easily 5 more things on menu I have to try. Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh, vibrant and full flavor profile. Started with an amazing light heirloom salad to wake up all of your senses! Then enjoyed a simple dish of spaghetti and meatballs; nothing like freshly made pasta and rustic style marinara which surprisingly paired beautifully with a nice glass of Sauvignon Blanc. Finished the night off with a chocolate torte paired with a Syrah; which probably could've been better paired with something more full bodied like a Chianti as recommended by Stephen our awesome server!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour. Great white sangria.  Messed up my friends pasta, but easy fix. Overall, great ambiance, good staff, and great drinks. One of my favorite spots for happy hour and dinner!"}
{"text":"I love North in Denver and love it here too! We came here for lunch and sat outside. The area outside is so pretty. We were greeted right away and ordered the chef board to start. It was just like their Denver location, outstanding. This time the staff did a better job of explaining what everything was that was on the board. I got a salad and my coworker went for the spaghetti. I love the Caesar here, although cost goes up quite a bit by adding chicken.  We were both very happy with the meal, however the food did take a while to come out, problematic with how hungry we were and that we needed to get back to work. No one let us know it was on the way or that they would check on it, made us feel kind of forgotten. Overall good experience, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have one complaint and that's why didn't I find this place sooner!? Holy Betty Crocker, this place is fantastic!  Firstly the decor is really nice. It's got this modern, rustic mix of an environment and I love it! From the wooden tables, to the pop of red and the large glass bauble lights hanging in the main dining area. Really beautiful.   The service was pretty good. Everyone was friendly and the food came out fairly quickly.   The food was absolutely delicious. I've tried the calamari, which was one of the best I've ever had. It's fried in a fluffy batter and served over some vinaigrette greens and a grilled lemon half. I've tried the Italian Grinder and the Meatball Sandwich. Both sandwiches are delicious and served with smashed, well seasoned potatoes and a side of lemony mayonnaise.  I do have one actual complaint... the valet parking. I really don't get why so many phoenix restaurants have this unnecessary, forced valet parking. It's a bit annoying when I can park my own car and not feel pressured to tip someone when I didn't want valet service at all.   Other than the valet parking this is a place you must try!! Next time I hope to try the pizza or pasta. MmmmMm!!!"}
{"text":"The food and the service are outstanding.  When I visited Phoenix, I was looking for a local restaurant with good food.  Needless to say, I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Super disappointed. Love the food and usually the service is on par. However after calling to make a reservation, I was told that I would receive a call back from the manager to confirm. I never received a call back and when I called back of course no one knew anything about a reservation. Bottom line don't tell a customer you're going to call them back and then fail to do so."}
{"text":"Outstanding food! The pizzas are great. The salads are great. The pasta boulanaise is outstanding.  We have eaten hear a few times and everyone in out group loved their food choice. Prices are reasonable and the quality is great. The watermelon salad gets rave reviews and the pasta boulanaise was 'the best i've ever had'."}
{"text":"I've been to North a few times in the past month. I really like the open air feeling of the restaurant. It is amazing that this cute Italian farm house used to be an old car wash.   The staff is pretty awesome and I have always enjoyed the food. Last time for breakfast I had the egg scramble, it was a beautiful surprise of fluffy eggs hugging asparagus and peas. I devoured the entire thing.    The happy hour is amazing, it is Monday-Friday 3-6 PM and All-Day Sunday. Last time for happy hour I got the $2 spicy nuts, $2 green olives and $5 chardonnay. Can't beat that.. I have to hand it to Sam Fox, he's scored again."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. First time trying it today. Thankfully it wasn't busy. I enjoyed the atmosphere. Was meeting up with friends to eat and have a drink. I ordered the Daily Special pizza which was Spicy Salami with arugula. Very tasty! I had reservations about the whole valet thing, but that's b/c I don't like anyone touching/driving my car but me lol. The waitress was nice. Would definitely eat there again"}
{"text":"I love their chicken Parmesan dish I've been there twice and I have gotten it both times. I get my little girls the cheese pizza, they love this pizza. I definitely recommend that if you have kids. I really enjoy the atmosphere and everyone is really friendly. Will be going back to try different items on the menu."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  This really is one of my favorite spots for dinner in Kierland.  The food is always reliable and every entree I have ever had has always been good. My husband and I both had the baked ziti.  Very flavorful and delicious pasta dish.  They do a great job with presentation and staff is always very attentive.  I prefer the outside seating in the restaurant. Defintely gets an \"A plus\" in my book."}
{"text":"So I came here with my nana who thought it was a great place, but upon looking at the menu, I was somewhat disappointed with the lack of variety. I couldn't really find anything that spoke to me so I ended up getting their Caesar salad with chicken. I was expecting it to be slightly larger and more filling for $15 price tag.    The service was friendly which is the reason why I didn't rate it 2 stars or less. Sadly I will not be coming back unless they add to their menu."}
{"text":"Company with poor integrity. Food quality is fine, sometimes, sometimes it is terrible. On the rare occasion I order delivery from this location of North, paying the escalated fees of course for this service, they send the worst quality food imaginable. Their inconsistent service is indicative of bad management. I will post a picture."}
{"text":"We'd been wanting to try North for a while and finally managed to get there. We went early, around five,  thinking it would be empty and we're surprised at the number of people who'd had the same idea. You can tell once this place gets really hopping it would be way noisier than it already was, not exactly a plus for me.   I was in the mood for a cocktail and tried two from their craft menu that were recommended by our server. Both were a little more complex, and sweeter than I usually like, I'm kind of a purist. Next time I'll probably stick with what I know.    We started with the grilled artichoke and garlic bread. I do love a good artichoke, and this one surely was. The aioli was not the best I'd ever had, could have used maybe some dill, or other herb. The garlic bread was otherworldly, and you damn well better love garlic because it is seriously loaded with it. The bread was light as air and the ricotta was amazing. I finished with the arugula salad, which I also loved. The hubs had the bolognese pasta. It was good, not as good as mine, but still worth having.   Another visit to check out other offerings is definitely in order."}
{"text":"Every dish was excellent. Service was awesome. Will definitely be back. Only one small thing: on the menu it says the sangria comes in a pitcher with oranges and strawberries .., but in reality it is actually only a carafe with one slice of orange on the glass and no other fruit. I was disappointed when the carafe came, but it tasted so amazing even without fresh fruit that I would say order it anyway if you are a sangria lover. We ordered a second carafe for good measure. Regarding the food: Our table ordered many different dishes family style: pasta bolognese, kale salad, Caesar salad, roasted cauliflower, truffle garlic bread... all phenomenal. Tiramisu has crunchy chocolate bits on top - a nice variation on the texture. Love this place. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Well what can I say about this place?  The restaurant is located in an upscale commercial complex with boutiques and an AJ's in the middle of Arrowhead Ranch.  Definitely doesn't have the boring suburban feel which you get along Bell Road only a mile away.  The inside has exposed brick on the walls with sleek looking seating.  Each food item comes out looking like a self made creation from the chef.  I have to say the Marguerite pizza is one of my favorites.  Having a crispy crust and savory flavors that make my mouth want to eat more, more, and more.  But I don't need to eat more because I fill my mouth with a good wine.  I had  a Dutton Estate Chardonnay(I think) which was half off on this day which kept me happy.  This place did not fail me. So will I be back?  Umm that's a yes!"}
{"text":"Fuck this place. No bread served before the meals and the portions are TINY! Italian, by tradition, is served in generous portions, but these meals were so small that my girlfriend, her mom, and her grandma were all left ready for another helping. And it's EXPENSIVE.  For what it is.  Would NOT come back.  I almost laughed when the waitress offered dessert because I hadn't felt like I even had dinner. Headed to Wingstop now."}
{"text":"Alissa was our waitress and was phenomenal! We frequently eat out and this will certainly be our new regular spot. Great menu, service and environment. It is often after bad service that you jump to write a review as it is noteworthy. This was so good that it made me go to write this immediately. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Another home run.  I love fox concepts. Each of the fox restaurants I've been to are unique but share the same quality good service and the same fluid flow of a well run restaurant.  This was our first time to north Italia. I wanted to try the chicken Parm and the mussels.   The bread was ok. Alright, I'll be honest. The bread was pretty unimpressive. I was slightly worried because of the bread was not so great, how was the meal going to be? Thankfully, my worries were unnecessary.  The mussels had me at first bite. I wanted to drink the leftover broth afterwards. Highly recommend it if you like mussels.  Chicken Parm was good and perfectly petite portion sized for those watching your waistlines. No leftovers here..."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times...and the food and atmosphere is always great. I usually order the Bruchetta w/ asparagus and the chopped salad. Both are great with a glass of wine! I highly reccomend for anyone looking for a modern italian atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a very important 4 stars. My wife and I had a major incident while we were there, and I have complete justification to write a bad review. However, the management staff recognized the major impact of the issue, took care of everything quickly, for the 4 star recovery. On to the food... I always respect an Italian restaurant that gives aranchinis a try. These were very good for an American restaurant. Still on the look out for an authentic style one... The entire menu seems like a scientific slight american modification of traditional Italian dishes. They were well prepared, but left me wanting the real thing. We will return, for the quality of the food was exceptional."}
{"text":"Not coming back.  Food was 3 stars and there was no service.  We were greeted and seated immediately by the hostess.  At first glance, the decor was simple, open, and soft lighting seems inviting and welcoming, but it stops there.  Don't get me wrong, there are a ton of staff and no one was particularly idle.  The failure on the service comes from a lack of training and perhaps the way the teams were structured.  From the time we were sat with a menu, it took 11mins for the server to come by and identify himself, as he was already walking away with his head turned to say \"I'll be right with you okkkkaayyy?\"  Another 4 minutes go by, he comes back to ask us if we wanted to order drinks, still no water in hand or on the table.  We asked for water and was about to order when he turned to leave so we actually had to stop him from running away to get the orders in and to not course it.  Now there are tables being set all around us that are assigned to various servers and our server got additional table at this point.  Everyone else did not seem to have to wait long to be greeted, get drinks, or have their orders taken.  We know this because the table that got sat 20mins after us in his section got their drinks and food first.  Not only that, our server never brought us bread until when my entree arrived and my husband asked if we needed to place an order for a bread basket.  You read that right.  My lone plate of pasta arrived first, ahead of the complimentary bread and our other plates, which were the arancini and a pizza.  When one requests to not course a meal, it is assumed to be brought out together, not one at a time.  By the time my husband's pizza and arancini arrived, my pasta dish was lukewarm.  Our bread with the olive oil and vinegar arrived last.  Server dropped it off and ran off without giving us bread plates.  We had to flag down someone else to get it.  Our water were never refilled.  We were almost through the meal when the server came by to ask \"how are things going?\" rather than when the food was delivered to see if we required condiments or if the food were to our liking.  I guess it's impossible when plates were spaced so far apart so that it was like we were eating separate meals.  About the food and flavors: - Arancini was delicious and comes in 3's on a cast iron plate, except the dish was not even hot when we got it.  It was filled with once melted but now has resolidified cheese - special of the day eggplant pizza was overly salty and the skin of the eggplant made it so when you took a bite, the entire topping came off with it and was messy to eat by hand.  You should fork and knife every bite - Squid Ink mafaldine was tomato and basil forward with a lot of heat to the spice.  While it's a unique dish, it was not great tasting and the portion was small for $20. The sauce to pasta ratio was good, but the amount of seafood was meager.  The 4 small shrimps and squid strips were not cooked in the sauce so it came out very bland  While I was still eating, the server started cleaning up my plate while I was mid bite to ask if we wanted dessert.  My husband had to stop the server and ask him to put the plate down because I was still eating.  My meal would have been no different if we ordered at a self serving kiosk and got our own water, utensils, and napkin with a number on an extension stand.  It was a ridiculous experience and a waste of time and money!  For the many Italian and Italian American options available in Summerlin (e.g. Trattoria Reggiano, Honey Salt, Masso Osteria, Spedini), I'm going to tell everyone to pass on North Italia."}
{"text":"Great get together with about 15 friends who had no reservation at this restaurant. We live on the edge!  But they welcomed us as we grabbed a couple of high bar tables outside and it was great. We all had several cocktails and appetizers all very good and our server was patient and kept track of all the checks which can be challenging.   It is very nice, fun place to hang out, have drinks or dinner.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just had the best meal we've had in some time.   We started  by sharing the fall vegetable salad, singlehandedly the most innovative salad I've had in a long time-faro, kale, romaine, dates and almonds in a beautifully light (and properly) dressed  white balsamic dressing.  Lord have mercy, that was GOOD! We then shared the ricotta gnocchi with beef short rib, arugula and bread crumbs. The bread crumbs did not go unnoticed by me.  They added a \"snap\" to the gnocchi that was fabulous-beautiful texture!  We also shared the raviolini which was stuffed with pork and roasted mushrooms, topped with fresh arugula in a preserved lemon sauce. Again, innovative and unbelievably delicious.  So unexpected, so delicious and all recommended by our knowledgable waiter, Connor.   And because we each took a very long bike ride today (and because we are pigs), we treated ourselves to one dessert each! The sticky toffee cake and the affogato.  Both were very good but super sweet and I would not have them again together-a bit too much. But that was our mistake. We simply couldn't stop. Once I got used to the salt on the sticky toffee cake which was a bit shocking on the buds (trust me, I know all about the salty sweet thing-I was a fan of it before you were born), I grew to adore it. We also got the affogato which we both agreed was a bit too sweet. I would have liked to bite into something a bit more substantial than just nutella-and trust me, I dig nutella. To sum up our experience-GO!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. Every dish I've tried is great and they put a fun spin on traditional italian cuisine. Highly recommend the bolognese   Reason for a 4 star rating - some of the staff isn't up to par. I've been here with great service and I've been here waiting for food for an hour and a half without explanation so service is hit or miss."}
{"text":"The perfect spot for a birthday dinner. Service was spot on, the food was wonderful, with a nicely paired wine list. Our waitress was very attentive gave us excellent service throughout the evening, especially with our large and at times demanding party. The buratta and chefs board appetizers were perfectly sized to share. Both the Caesar and seasonal vegetable salads were wonderfully fresh and just the right size. Everyone liked their entrees, but especially the bolognese, chicken pesto, and prosciutto pizza. The bolognese paired well with the valpolicella ripasso on the reserve wine list. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We love going to Fox restaurant concepts restaurants. They never let us down. North Italia was no exception. The menu is fresh. We make sure to sample an appetizer and a dessert as well. The pictures really do tell the story. See the fried cheese balls, I forget their name, were just perfectly crispy on the outside and with gooey mushroom risotto on the inside. For our entrées, we tried A sandwich and a pasta. The chicken sandwich came with a lemon aïoli which was surprisingly yummy. The pasta we got was a sopresetta, more of a bitter dish, with mushrooms, chicken and arugula. Needed a little salt and would be yummy with a hint of sun dried tomatoes. Our dessert was the dark chocolate Nutella tart. It was rich and dark just like I like my chocolate. There were several other things on the menu I wish my tummy could have managed to try, but alas, we will just have to return again. A lot of the salads in particular looked amazing from what I saw at other tables."}
{"text":"Great food! We had the meatballs for a starter and they were awesome for a large group. I had the prosciutto and fig pizza and it was SO GOOD. I tried some of the pasta my group was having and it was good as well. Having just been to Italy it was pretty close to the real deal. One thing to keep in mind is that it isn't a place for a quite or relaxing meal. It is LOUD and kind of crowded, but that's part of the atmosphere. Just be prepared for it! We couldn't talk across the table when we were there."}
{"text":"North...another beautiful atmosphere. Get the bread, soft, with a side of pesto. The calamari salad is good, I love the amount of spinach they put, but it's really more like a salad. The calamari is always a little tough. The artichoke is creamy and amazing. I've also had the ravioli which was wonderful. I need to try the pizza next."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday.  It's a bit noisy making it difficult for a party of six to join into the conversation.  Food is very good and the service is excellent.  We ordered all across the menu and all in the party seemed to enjoy their meals.  I would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian food, great service and wonderful patio. Make a reservation ahead of time!"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here on Saturday 9/7 to celebrate his birthday.  We are big fans of North Kierland (we had our 1st date & got engaged here :)) so we decided to try the Arcadia location.  It was great!  The atmosphere was extremely loud as there was a 40th birthday celebration with a group of 15 seated in the center of the restaurant, which made our dinner conversation a lot louder than it should have been. The staff was amazing quick friendly service.  We had the mussels to start and they were delicious!  The dish was served with 2 pieces of bread, which was not enough for the large bowl of broth and we were charged for the additional bread which was disappointing but well worth it.  For our entrees I had the seared scallops with mushroom risotto and at the reccommendation of our server he had the short ribs.  My dish was outstanding and we ending up sharing that as his was just average.  The ribs came with gnocchi which was good except there was very little meat.  My dish had 3 medium sized scallops they were cooked perfectly, but for the price I don't think I'd order again.  Overall the food was good, the atmosphere was far too loud to be considered kid friendly, and the price for the quantity was extremely over priced."}
{"text":"Italian food with a twist. I tried squid ink pasta , it had overwhelming amount of seasoning , plus our server or a menu had mentioned nothing about it being pretty spicy , so if you aren't a fan of hot food this dish is definitely not for you. Red sangria they had on special was bland. This is not a place I would recommend my friends to try."}
{"text":"Such delicious food, very attentive servers and I really liked the complementary valet! We had the chicken parmigiana which was different but so tasty and the Strozzapreti, amazing!!!!!! Definitely a beautiful date restaurant."}
{"text":"I gave it a 3 because the ambiance,  the service and the drinks was good, but the food is lower than expected. I would rate the food a one. The pizza was not even close to a true italian pizza, the arancini were barely acceptable, the trouffle  bread and the zucca chips we're below average however the marinara sauce was good. We end up not ordering more because food was so disappointing. I would definitely not give this place a try for a while. The menus need to be reviewed and the food quality need to improve for the price."}
{"text":"The Food and drink selections were amazing!! Was greeted by a very nice server who was knowledgeable and provided recommendations. I had the Short Rib dish with a Mascarpone polenta side.  The dish was prepared flawlessly, the meat was tender and juicy, the polenta was soft and creamy and cooked to perfection. Although a bit loud, overall I had a pleasant dining experience. Will most likely visit again."}
{"text":"Great food, great location and great staff.  The complimentary valet parking was a plus and made it hassle free to get inside the restaurant.  The layout is very nice and I love the atmosphere is emits.  Great for groups if you can reserve the seating."}
{"text":"Go on a Sunday - not too busy but fantastic happy hour menu. Pretty much everything on the menu that looked good to me was available on the happy hour menu and my server was very nice. Tried the zucchini chips and a margarita pizza with pepperoni. Both yummy! Also got the happy hour house red wine which I liked. They have indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"OK wanted to give a horrible review that bashed the service and Scottsdale in general.   Yes the food is great... and overpriced a bit for the portions.  OK the service isn't bad just they have that Scottsdale arrogance I'm guessing they could use better hours and better pay.  Had some great little event get together here in the past and am thank full for it."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant in town! To be honest mainly thanks to Nick, our waiter, he made sure we were taken very good care of, he was very attentive and made amazing suggestions. He was very professional yet funny and easy going. The food was beyond amazing, everything we tried exceeded our expectations. He helped us with wine recommendations as well and of course loved that!  Price wise, I feel it was very reasonable . I highly recommend this place and can't wait to be back there again soon."}
{"text":"Love this place. Funny thing is we've been going here for months, almost a year, and just found out the restuarant is on the other side of the bar side, lol.  We frequently come here for sangrias or beer and pizzas outside on the couches. Wish they had a cheaper champagne for mimosas though, the bottle is $81!!"}
{"text":"American Italian, but a pretty cool little place. Recently purchased additional space is quieter."}
{"text":"North has become a frequent lunch spot for my wife and I on Saturday afternoons. We typically sit at the bar or outside of its not too hot. The staff is always very friendly and the food is always good. We both always get the same thing, the chopped chicken salad and an occasional glass of wine or Bloody Mary. I am sure we will back within the next few weeks."}
{"text":"Great italian food with meatballs as a starter got us hooked right away then the pastas we ordered were legit the best and fresh!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and food! Service wasn't fantastic but I'm sure that will be ironed out eventually."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place! A friend suggested we come here for a late lunch on Monday and I jumped at the chance.   Our server brought out ciabatta bread with a orange colored spread, it was buttery and delicious. We started with the appetizer size romaine salad w/ lemon dressing, the croutons were soft and seasoned well. I ordered the thin crust, spicy chicken & caramelized onion pizza. It was the happy hour pizza so it only cost $6.00!!  I look forward to sampling other items from the menu. The reason I gave North 4 stars is because I really liked their outdoor dining area. This place is classy yet casual at the same time."}
{"text":"First time, but how can you burn Chicken Parmesan?  Waiter was a ghost after order.  Disappointing.  Maybe an off night."}
{"text":"The service was good. Atmosphere was good. The price was right. The food was delicious. You can tell that they make things fresh (bolognese). The dessert was also delicious (tiramisu). I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Great for a casual happy hour with 1-3 others because the wine is good and the food on hh is excellent, but the service is way too inexperienced and often, I would like to believe unintentionally, rude for a pleasant dinner."}
{"text":"Moved from Chicago and was excited to read the reviews.  Had drinks and then it went downhill from there. We ordered a couple of appetizers.  The arencini was extremely bland and  mushy. The second appetizer had roasted cauliflower and broccolini with a fried egg on top. The egg was cold. The entrees we ordered were brought to our table cold.  The scallops that I ordered were over cooked and so greasy.   Our server was wonderful and very apologetic.  As we were leaving we were nearly run over by another server who was quite rude. Won't try this place again. So many of these places just don't make the grade and serve mediocre food."}
{"text":"We went for an early lunch last Sunday and really enjoyed it. The vibe inside is fresh and clean with the indoor and outdoor meshing into one. We loved the truffle bread as our appetizer. My husband and I got pizzas and enjoyed them. My mother ordered pasta which was delicious and you can tell the pasta was made fresh. Will definitely return to try more items."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place...we were in LV for my daughters soccer team and we were looking for a non chain locals favorite and we found it. Our family has become somewhat of pizza snobs over the last few years taking trips to Italy and NYC. So getting run of the mill pizza really isn't our thing anymore...with that being said we were all so glad we came across this place. The atmosphere is top notch and the food is the same. The thin crust pizza done in super hot ovens is on point and when it comes out it is still bubbling...careful you can burn your mouth. Not sure about some of the other not so positive reviews, but I would look right over those and see this place for what it is....  We ended up sharing a few dishes among friends and family... we shared the prosciutto and fig pizza, spicy salami and arugula pizza, bacon and egg pizza, margherita pizza, meatballs, crispy zucchini slices and calamari. Everything was spectacular and despite all the choices my favorite was and always be a really good margherita pizza. I know simple and plain but this pie was amazing. Everyone loved the  items and it was great sharing.  If you are in Vegas and don't travel a short ways off the strip you are truly missing out...."}
{"text":"For most of what I've seen in Scottsdale its super pre-fab chains and this was a great break from that! The bruschetta and pizzas were amazing.  People were also fans of the desserts and pastas.  And generally speaking it was pretty reasonable for the quality and quantity.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot.. open & airy dining area .. great food & service..  On my last visit we started with the zucca chips, light and crispy.. you can't eat just one, you find yourself going back to the bowl until they're gone.   I had the Italian grinder sandwich (turkey, salami, pepperocini relish) with a side salad, perfect lunch size.. meat & bread were a yummy match..   Order the dessert.. you won't regret it.. it was my first time .. I had the bambolini .. four Italian donuts served over Meyer lemon curd and mascarpone.. omg so light and those flavors mix and pop in your mouth.. perfect ending to a great meal.  Service is always friendly.. looking forward to my next meal here!"}
{"text":"I went here last night to meet up with a girlfriend that I grew up with.  We haven't seen each other since we were kids at camp, and we ended up dining here.  I guess this place has two seating areas.  One appears to be more of a restaurant, and the other seems to be more of a bar area.  Both are upscale and classy, but I am not sure why they split it up.    Anyways, the resturant area was jam packed, but our party sat in the Bar north location.  We sat in the patio area.  Fortunately, they had heat lamps to keep us warm.  The menu here seemed to be fine, with pasta, pizzas, and a more upscale choice of food.  Great alcohol selection to choose from.  I went with the angel hair pasta and marinara sauce.  The waiter informed me that I could add chicken or shrimp to my dinner.  I went with the chicken.  The food came out and it was well presented.  The salad that my Girlfriend had seemed to be a small portion, which didnt impress me.  it was like a spoonful of salad.  My dinner was actually very tasty, but the chicken that came with my pasta was whole, and I had to cut it up into chunks. I guess thats fine, I just found it odd that the chicken was not mixed in with the pasta?  The food was tasty though!  I inhaled it!  Anyways, I really liked this place, but the service was just okay.  Our server sucked at refilling drinks. I had to ask him twice for water, and remind him every single time that my pop was running low.  He never once took it upon himself to refill my water. I hate running out of beverages, AND having to ask for refills!  The place is very well decorated though.  Nice interior!  Will return, since its worth my time, but a little pricey."}
{"text":"We had a great time. The atmosphere is fresh, fun and lively. There were all age groups (ours is on the older side! HaHa!) The staff made us feel welcome and the food was amazing! We had a combination of appetizers and main course dishes and everything was delicious. This restaurant is a must, if you haven't been already."}
{"text":"My daughter picked this for her birthday meal. We had been to a Yelp event here in the past and have been wanting to go back and try it. Boy am I glad she picked this place. We started with the grilled artichoke for an appetizer. WOW! I had no clue how much I would love this. It has truffle oil lemon aioli and was amazing. I didn't want to share but did! For my meal, I had an italian salad with Sopressetta and added chicken. The dressing was light and refreshing and the flavor combination was amazing. I love that it was served on a board like the Charcuteri platters.   Our server was great. She even showed us how eat the artichoke properly. She kept our drinks full, was attentive and answered all my questions. I loved watching the kitchen prepare all the food, and the atmosphere is great, nice and open and bright. Can't wait to go back and I am not sharing my artichoke next time!"}
{"text":"This was recommend to us and the first time we tried to go the wait was more than an hour. The next day we came at 5 pm and did not have to wait. We were so glad we came back!   With a group of 5 we shared 2 salads and 4 entrees and a dessert and we were quite full.   The seasonal salad was especially good. We tried the 3 pastas and a pizza. I especially liked the short rib pasta with a creamy sauce. The others were also well enjoyed, the mushroom pizza, the black squid pasta. The bolognese was good too but the others were more unique and enjoyed.   Fun decor and good service and good food. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food is always superb and if you don't like anything at least try the caramel dessert my hubby and I are in agreement that it's literally to die for! I'd recommend coming early as peak dinner times you will find it more crowded."}
{"text":"North Italia is very modern but warm and inviting. This location has a great patio to enjoy when the weather is nice. If you are going after 5 most nights and there is more than 2 of you I would suggest making a reservation. I like to start with the grilled cauliflower - so good! My salad of choice would be the arugula and fennel because its light but has a lot of flavor. For a main entree I think the burrata tortelloni is absolutely the best - loads of flavor, beautiful texture to the pasta, and feels hearty! I would also recommend the grilled branzino or salmon entrees. I would not really recommend the bolognese, it was okay but there are much tastier items! The reason I gave it a four is because out of all the times I have been there I felt like the service was not great."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Tears for Fears - Everybody Wants to Rule the World)  Welcome to North Fattoria There's no turning back Even while we eat We will find you at the bar for Happy Hour Buy a drink and some bruschetta Everyone should try North Fattoria  It's my own decision It's my own review Help you to decide Help you make the most Of eating and of pleasure Nothing ever taste this good Everyone should try North Fattoria  North Fattoria Italiana, almost a mouth full trying to say it.  Either that or I'm busy stuffing my face!  NFI is a Sam Fox Restaurant so you know the ambience is awesome!  I've never felt out of place every time I go to any of his restaurants.  NFI is laid out like an old Italian kitchen.  Like mama's home cooked meal I say!  Lots of vintage lighting and an open patio.  I believe the garage doors open during the cooler months for a fresh breeze to run through the restaurant -- mmm nice!    I came to NFI several times and their HH is very good.  Wine and dine at the bar with some flatbreads cause it's my favorite.  I ordered \"The Pig\"  and it was a bunch of pork, but man you know; that's what I like!  No skimping the protein here!  Nice warm and cheese crust, while can add some crushed pepper to give it some kick!  Perfect with \"ma ber\"!  Their pasta is good too so don't for get to leave some room before you come.  I ordered their regular spaghetti and meatballs and lets just say it's my favorite in town!  The sauce taste like it's made from scratch while the meatballs, well meatballs to me are meatballs, but the sauce is what really makes a pasta dish.  In the end, I was delighted with my meals and the atmosphere was perfect to just relax and enjoy a few drinks before departing. - Enjoy"}
{"text":"Great food and environment! Modern Italian kitchen, very tasty. Pasta is homemade and fresh. The bruschetta appetizer was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I was so conflicted with my rating for this restaurant. Myself and two other friends decided to try this place out on a Friday night for some much needed catching up time. This restaurant fares more on the trendy side, with split seating outdoors and indoors serving craft beers and specialty cocktails along with fresh made in-house pastas and quality ingredients.  Pros: DELICIOUS food-communally shared white truffle garlic bread, and I got the burrata tortelloni; our waitress was very friendly and talkative.  Cons: Service was frustratingly slow; portion size is very small; price is expensive ($17 for my 8 pieces of pasta, $10 for the 4 pieces of bread)."}
{"text":"Great food, decent service and reservations are always on time when it is super busy. I like the squid ink pasta and the yucca chips. Their ice tea is really good too. Recommend 9/10"}
{"text":"I almost desperately want to give NoRTH five stars, because the food is really something special, but it has one huge problem -- its very, very noisy (outside may be better if it is cool enough).    About the food - traditional Italian fare is freshly and expertly prepared before your eyes (well you can see the cooks but not the cooking).  The short ribs are particularly well done, and I recommend the platter version because the onions, greens, and other fixings are perfect for the dish.  The pasta is freshly made and tastes like it.  Another recommendation: the arancini (fried rice balls in a red sauce).  Hint: don't order the pizza; it might be really good but you don't want to miss the other menu items.  There is a decent wine list and a number of beers, including Italian offerings.  The prices seem high for beer but low for wine, which is a bit odd.  Service is pleasant, although on crowded nights it can be a bit of a wait for your food.  But don't worry -- you will be entertained by the other patrons: NoRTH is kind of a meat market, both at the bar and at the tables, so people watching can be, shall we say, diverting."}
{"text":"I'm so torn between 3 and 4 stars. We have been to North (this location) only a handful of times. The food is always delicious but the service declines every subsequent visit.   The pork tenderloin is so delicious if they don't overcook it but the polenta, sweet potatoes and balsamic reduction was finger licking delicious. The boyfriend ate almost half my plate because his chicken parm wasn't anything special. When we go back the tenderloin is all he can think about.  Goat cheese/beet salad is very yummy as is the Caesar. delicious croutons that seem to be made In house. Small portions but the entrees are so filling.  Short ribs are also delicious... That polenta I tell you! But the desserts are heavily lacking.  Pretty bland even if it does mention Nutella (my krypotonite!) I'd rather hit up a corner store for a pint of B&J.  I do like that they offer a slightly larger our of wine for a few bucks more.    We have sat at the bar and dinner tables during busy AND slow times. Water never refilled. Poured our own bottle of wine after the first initial pour. One server even opened our bottle away from the table and just walked up casually with it which I thought was kind of strange but maybe that's just how they do things there. Service is not friendly or particularly helpful which could set this place apart but shucks. Just mediocre at best"}
{"text":"I love the look of this place. Very open and inviting. Also great that they have complementary valet.  The decor is awesome! Very impressed. I loved that we could watch them make the fresh pasta and bread from our table.   We stopped in for an early lunch on Labor Day, with our awesome Fox Restaurants 25% off coupon! Thank you!  We had hopped to get the brunch menu, but since it was Monday we had to go with the lunch menu, looked just as good tho, so no worries.   We had this yummy cheese and bread appetizer, you must try it! Then we shared the salami panini and the other girls had a meat lovers looking pizza. Pretty much everything was gone from our plates so I think it is safe to say we all enjoyed the food.   There is something for everyone here, nice bar, a TV to catch some sports, a nice patio facing the Arcadia neighborhood, and lots of space to push some tables together for a large party.   What impressed me the most.... we arrived at 10:45 a.m. (we were for some reason thinking we were doing brunch) 15 minutes prior to them opening... and we were seated right away, they didn't even mention that we were early and they weren't open yet. Business as usual. Very nice, thank you!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and food! Friendly staff, especially  our server Alissa! Great personality!   Will be back whenever we are in town! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I went to this North Italia location for dinner on a Saturday night. We got the Margherita Pizza, one of the pastas, and two scoops of gelato. The pizza was delicious! It was a good serving size and more than enough for two people to share. The gelato was also yummy! Perfect for a warm night out in Phoenix over the summer.  The overall ambiance is a mix of classy and casual at the same time. The decor inside is BEAUTIFUL! Parking valet is complimentary, but don't forget to still tip your valet drivers!  I do wish the dinner menu was a bit more comprehensive. I would've loved to see more pastas. I have not tried happy hours here but would definitely come back to give it a chance. Overall a decent experience here."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place because we had just come back from our honeymoon in Italy and we were looking for an authentic Italian restaurant back home. This place is legit. Their cocktails are very delicious. Their chefs board was a delicious little taste of everything and you must ask for extra apricot pepper jelly! It tastes amazing on anything! Their bolognese was very true to what we had in Italy. Another must try is the short rib radiatori. I've never had a white creamy pasta with fresh horseradish on it! Completely new, crazy, amazing flavor! It was a long wait for the food and drinks, but the place was crazy busy and the food definitely made up for the waiting."}
{"text":"Place is cool.  Great ambience in the restaurant. Great cozy lighting. Perfect for date night,  I was surprised by the food though, the tiniest portions of b"}
{"text":"Place had great ambiance.  Loved the restaurant and surroundings .  Beautiful area too.  The food was just so-so.  We had the the bologanese. Came out in the smallest bowl.  Almost a kid sized serving.  Needed some bread to go with it   It wasn't worth the $17. My husbands was a chicken dish. And came in the same size bowl mine did.  Way to small. And everything was overly salted.  My  drink came in little baby sized glasses.  Seems everything is scaled down.  I would not come here again.  Also too noisy inside, sit outside and you will be glad you did.  Sorry North.  You need to step up your game a lot more. Be more generous with your servings. And always give bread with pasta. It's just wrong when you don't."}
{"text":"Went last night for an early valentines day dinner, we got there at 6pm and the place was full and the wait for a table was over 20 minutes. So instead we decide to have a drink at the bar, but we are not bar people so we sat and a bartender came to us and greeted us very politely. It wasnt my first time so i knew what drinks we liked to order, but my girfriend decide to have a glass of wine instead, and the best experience in a restaurant are with wine, we were recomended some pasta dishes and what kind of wine goes well with the food, the bartender Paulo explained  every single pasta dish to us and what wine we should have so with the aracini and meatballs as appetizers, then the salmon cooked medium was just fantistic, my girfriend had the pesto pasta which is my favorite pasta, it was so well cooked and the pasta is al dente, btw they made their own pasta, of course a bottle of red wine,  Then desserts the buddino is like caramel puddin omg amazing and also the torta i couldnt belive it how much we ate.  Any ways we ate at the bar for the first time and just because the incredible service of this bartender from now we are gonna be regulars and of course sit at the bar.  Thank you North for this amazing experience and like Paolo told us last night \"let me give a tour for the culinary adventure of Italy\"  Food 10 stars, service 10 stars."}
{"text":"Update: North is still delicious...!!! 3/11/18  \"Reunited & It Feels So Good....\"  I fell in love with this modern, family oriented, indoor out door Italian restaurant when my favorite unfiltered dame introduced me to North in Scottsdale.   The vibe is welcoming and the fresh made daily  pasta & pizza dough is delicious!  Our overall service was pretty consistent considering their recent grand opening!  FOOD Crisp Calamari $13 Highly recommended golden brown calamari paired with arugula and lemon of course. Great portion size for the price. Tortellini $17 This vegetarian friendly main dish was smaller than I anticipated but filling.  Daily Pizza (Potato Spinach) $14 SURPRISINGLY SPICY and our server failed to mention it before ordering. Thankfully I'm about that spice life! My first potato pizza and I enjoyed it.  Dirty Almond Chai $5.00 This latte was refreshing & filthy at the same time and I enjoyed every sip!   DON'T SKIP DES Dessert was on the House compliments of management but I honestly would have paid double for the Tiramisu & Buddino.    Total $56+ Tip   Heck yes I'll be back! This is just the beginning!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Italian food however I was definitely impressed with North's Fresh pasta made daily appetizers and dessert menu.   I had the opportunity to dine before hitting the interstate. The weather was phenomenal and the outdoor ambiance was refreshing.  My friends and I ordered a Margherita Pizza $12, Crisp Calamari $12, Caesar Salad $9 & Spaghetti & Meatballs $16. Dessert was heaven we ordered the Salted Caramel Budino $7 and my absolute fave Tiramisu (the crisp chocolate balls were so delicious). Next time I'm in Scottsdale I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"6 people seated at 515pm on Monday. Fantastic service and even as it became packed by 7pm our server was on point. Steak, pesto pasta, pizza and salads super fresh and tasty. The open kitchen was warm and inviting with people scurrying around but not loud or annoying. Worth the experience."}
{"text":"I had such a good time at North. The bartender was really servicial and friendly and always made sure to offer me more drinks. I ordered the Tuscan Tomato Soup as an appetizer which was a large portion and very yum. I then ordered the Strozzapreti Pasta w/Mushrooms, Spinach, Toasted Pine Nuts & Parmesan Cream as my entree after the bartender recommended it and mentioned it as one of their best dishes. It was DIVINE. Can not wait to go back to AZ & have dinner at North."}
{"text":"Love love love North. They have amazing salads and I love their pizza. Last time however the waitress suggested I try a pasta.....So glad I did. It was just as good as the pizzas. Everything is always so fresh and the service is wonderful. This is one of my fav places."}
{"text":"I stopped in here to sit at their patio for a rest and a beer after exploring the Kierland Commons.  The staff was very friendly, helpful and informative about their restaurant and specials.  The place settings in the wine bar looked picture perfect and the patio chairs were soooo comfortable.  I could have sat there all day.  Oh, and the happy hour deals are amazing for such a swanky place.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This North catered an event we had for 30 people this past weekend. The manager, Jonas, went above and beyond to make it successful and even delivered it personally to our house and lent us the serving trays for better presentation. The food was delicious, particularly the short rib. Very much a success!"}
{"text":"After coming away from NoRTH on North Scottsdale Rd. with a bland, over priced experience, we were wary when invited to this location. As soon as we arrived it was night and day difference. Parking is ridiculous and the place gets very crowded but after tasting the food you will know why.   We started with pork belly which is simply amazing. Honestly just delicious. We followed up with a round of pastas. I ordered the tagliatelle which is some of the best pasta I have had in my life. It is all made fresh in the open air kitchen - you can glance over and see it being made. NOTHING beats minutes old pasta in my book. The freshness elevates everything on the menu. Others had bucatini (think a thick spaghetti with a little bite) with meatballs - simple and delicious.   For dessert we had the salted caramel which was surprisingly perfect for a shared item. All in all just really great food and a  unique atmosphere. We brought others back on a second visit and everything again exceeded our expectations.   Takeaway: Skip the north NoRTH location and hit this one up. Its worth the parking headaches and the food is top notch."}
{"text":"I love this place. I go once a week. I love-love-love their thin crusted pzzas. I've had them all. My husband and I usually get the short ribs with polenta, which is fantastic and a pizza to split. I think the fig & proscuitto is my favorite.  It says on Yelp that it's not suitable for kids, but my kids love North. They like to people watch. I've never had a bad experience. The wait staff is fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Yes ---yes---and more yes!!! The artichokes and calamari were on par!!! The pasta dishes were so fresh and tasted amazing! Our server was very attentive and was great with taking care of my daughter with food allergies!!! To top it off--- they brought us complimentary Prosecco to celebrate our ten year wedding anniversary! Hands down--amazing!!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy get into my tummy. We tried twice to come here but both times it was super busy so prepare to wait when you decide to visit. The ambiance is awesome with a farmhouse feel to it: bronze salt & pepper shakers, wood top tables, comfy cushy chairs, even the uniforms are a farm feel but it works!  I immediately asked the server for vegan options and even though they don't offer a separate menu for those items, he was able to point out my options with making some adjustments to them. For my meal I had the   Tuscan Kale Salad (remove the cheese and parmesan vinaigrette dressing) and he replaced it with another dressing and it came with grapes and apples. It was awesome!!   Special of the day Vegetable pizza (hold the cheese) came with broccolini, crispy eggplant, mushrooms, roasted red peppers on a gluten free crust and it was AMAZING!! It was a decent portion, 6 good size slices and I ate every single one loving every bite   The bf ordered the tomato soup of the day and the scallops. He loved every moment and our meal was complimented by a glass of the Riesling, pinot grigio and a makers old fashion.  The service there was awesome from being greeted at the door to our server and food runners. Everyone was so friendly and if something wasn't right, they would do their best to accompany the request. Nick was our server and even though was very busy, never left us hanging for service.   Definitely check out this place and also in the same shopping center they're opening up a sister location called the Flower Child which looks to be a farm to table concept. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to North Italia for some time. It's located in the Kierland Commons and since it's pretty busy I decided to make a reservation on Open Table.   We walked in and it was pretty early for dinner but the place had a lot of people already. Pretty loud. It had Wood floods, wooden tables, bar with an open kitchen. Pretty modern looking with large glass windows overlooking the outdoor tables. We got an indoor table since was pretty hot outside.   We were greeted right away by our waitress and she got our drink orders right away. We decided to start off with the Bruschetta. It came with only four pieces and had prosciutto and grilled asparagus heads. It was really good. Since there was four of us we each got a piece, just wish there was more cause it was really good. Really enjoyed it.   After this we split the Tuscan Kale salad which had grilled grapes, apples, cheese with a Parmesan vinaigrette. It was probably one of the best kale salad I've had in awhile. Nice and fresh. The dressing was so good not overpowering. Really good.   I shared the Prosciutto pizza with my son. It had lots of prosciutto of course with figs, goat cheese, and arugula. Really nice crust. The prosciutto and figs went so well together. It was a really good pizza. I could have eaten that pizza by myself but controlled myself. Darn good.   My wife and daughter ordered the Bolognese since they weren't that hungry. I got to sneak a bite and the pasta was so fresh. The meat sauce was very good. Small little kick but really good.   To end our meal I had a latte and an olive oil cake. The cake was small like a cupcake with strawberries and oranges. The cake had a lemon taste and it was really good. Really refreshing with the fresh fruit.   Our waitress was really good. She was very friendly and was always smiling. She kept filling our water cups and got our food  out pretty quickly. Very good service.   So overall this place had really good service  with really good food. Very fresh. Really good Italian food. Great pizza. The place is pretty loud inside and pretty busy. When we left I saw a lots of people waiting for tables so I would recommend a reservation. Enjoy and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Meh. Stopped in at North today while shopping at the Commons. It was in fact, quite common. Don't mean to be a hater, but I live in San Francisco and must be spoiled by really good Italian. That said, I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio that was too tart for being \"full bodied.\" Then I had the seasonal vegetable salad with salmon. I had to ask the food server if the salad had been pre-prepared because the leaves were horribly wilted. He said it was made upon order. Seems unlikely, but...  The salmon was dry and overcooked. Boo.  I had to ask for bread and it arrived stale and tasteless.  I ordered a glass of Sauvignon blanc and it was marginally better than the PG.  All by way of saying, Postino was hopping a mere ten feet away and I'm guessing it's because it's good!  $50 lunch. Now I don't feel as guilty about that that last min purchase at BR. Just saying."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Located right next to The Greene House (another Fox restaurant concepts restaurant). We got seated right away for dinner around 5:30 pm. Although the table was small and very close to other tables, the restaurant was definitely \"homey' enough for it NOT to be distracting.  Our server came to us with a plate of olives (which none of us ate unfortunately)  We started with the bruschetta appetizer. Prosciutto with asparagus and crescenza cheese. Although pricey and portioned small, the flavors balanced each other well enough to satisfy the taste buds.   After asking our server, we decided to split the Strozzapreti dish: pesto sauce with pine nuts and crispy capers. Add chicken for a little extra. The portions were perfect to be split. A hungry customer would've definitely been able to finish a regular dish to themselves though. The dish was a little bit salty because of the capers. Otherwise, very tasty. We asked for bread to neutralize the \"saucy-ness\" and they happily gave us two slices no charge.   Tiramisu for dessert. MELT IN YOUR MOUTH. so good!  By the end of our dinner, the lighting was dimmer and the restaurant a bit louder. They do have an open kitchen which makes the restaurant a little more casual. My main complaint is in the small dining area, people stare at you and your food and it is sooo obvious. Moreso because their tables are so close to yours, its as if you are sitting at one table but...not really.   Happy Hour can be enjoyed at the bar or the dining room. Plenty of tables on the patio but the tables are again, pretty small."}
{"text":"One of the best indicators of a restaurant, I think is the how the restaurant sounds. Happy eaters who are animated - eating and drinking and have conversations. This was our experience at North. We walked into an an animated restaurant and happy waiters. The appetizers - esp.the cauliflower was amazing. The pasta and branzino were out of this world. Great food  and wine ,wonderful atmosphere and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Went on a girls out-ting with 12 or so of us. The bread at the beginning wasn't worth eating.   I had the Rosemary Chicken and potatoes (split! Huge portion) and it was absolutely fantastic. I also had the hazelnut cake and it was a little better than average.   Nice atmosphere and the service for a big group was great."}
{"text":"Great new spot in summerlin. Took our family there for our Christmas dinner and we were not disappointed. Food was flavorful and thoughtful. Service was friendly and professional without being overbearing. Restaurant was very busy but we were seated immediately for our reservation. Must have arancini, buratta and pears, and Italian farm salad. desserts butterscotch budino and almond cake. Looking forward to returning again soon."}
{"text":"Nice Arcadia area restaurant.  Pretty industrial look to the place, valet parking.  Meatball appetizers were very good and the pasta bolognaise was great as well.  Good selection of mixed drinks, wine and beer.  Very nice waitress and very attentive.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Did a work lunch here. It was excellent. Pasta was over the moon good. Sandwiches had great flavor but bread was a little hard to bite off. Side of potatoes were super fluffy and delicious. Great service. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Good lunch spot when you have a taste for something healthy and light.  My friend had the salmon and was satisfied.   I forgot the pasta name, but it included scallops which were slightly on the firmer side then I usually like.  However the dish all together was very good, mushrooms and all!  Would definitly come back when in the neighborhood, but won't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Good food good people. Dessert is unreal! The appetizers are all very tasty. I usually get the short rib hash for brunch. For dinner the Bolognese did not disappoint. Meat balls come w 6 so that's a perfect amount for sharing."}
{"text":"Our food was amazing and sent out quick.  Jaz our server paid attention to even the smallest of details and was very courteous and friendly. My friends and I will be back often."}
{"text":"Starters:  - Grilled artichoke: Not a favorite for the table, but a definite favorite of mine.  Very beefy and full of flavor - Grilled calamari: Wow.  Silky smooth with a hint of the grill and the white bean ragu, which I was skeptical of, blended perfectly - Steamed mussels:  If not for being in public, I would have picked up the bowl and drank the broth directly.  The mussels were good too. - Braised meatballs: Very nice red sauce.  Might have been a tad too tender and I might have missed it, but I like a little bit of pork in my meatballs.  Main (I only have what I tasted to go on, but the rest of my party looked very happy):  - At the suggestion of the server, I had the scallops.  I wish I hadn't.  Although the description looked wonderful, it felt like the mushroom risotto, scallops, and shallots didn't mix well.  The shallots blocked out the risotto, which blocked out the scallops and the scallops, while tender enough, had little flavor.  That being said, the risotto by itself was very good.  Desserts:  -Salted caramel budino: I'd drive the 25 miles back here just for the dessert.  Just amazing.  The creaminess of the creme freche topping with the salt and caramel was perfect.  Again, if I wasn't in public, I would have licked the small cup clean.    Very good wait staff and nicely timed for a large group.  Next time, I'll try the gluten free pasta instead of one of the meats and see how that goes.  Can't wait for more budino!"}
{"text":"We go here on a weekly basis, sometimes twice a week. Service is always good. Bolognese is the best. Sunday specials are great too."}
{"text":"Well you Better ask for Freddy ~~~~ And the Truffle Bread!!!! Win Win situation for sure!!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the wine, the service, the salad, the soup, the energetic atmosphere, the pizza, the meatballs, the dessert -- loved it all. We just moved to this neighborhood and know we will be regulars!"}
{"text":"The food was great but the restaurant was too loud and the service was so so. I wish I could give it 3.5 stars. I will certainly go back again."}
{"text":"the fish is always fresh, the beef short ribs are always tender and love the seasonal veggies.... It can get a little loud on the weekends but it's always a great experience. The staff is knowledgable and friendly. and Their bread is so good. For a corp Fox rest. concept, North is the best !"}
{"text":"I will say I was VERY disaponited at this location. The BURRATA TORTELLONI was undercooked and the flover was NOT the same as the Arcardia Location.  Had a GREAT server Booby  but my wife and both felt you need to vist the other Location.  Sorry  Robert"}
{"text":"Party of 3 on a Sunday. No wait for an excellent seat on the patio. Started with a couple of local beers and iced tea. Meat and cheese tray for an app that we finished in about five minutes. Delicious!!! Also had the zucchini chips that were just ok. One of us had brick oven pizza that was phenom.  My other friend ordered a sandwich that she enjoyed and I hAd a salad. It was a delightful Sunday afternoon. Overall good service would definitely return."}
{"text":"Went to North one day after work with my wife and started with the appetizers.  Ended up getting two pizza's thinking they would be small since they were on the happy hour menu.  We were wrong!  They were delicious thin crust with lots of good toppings almost normal size.  Tasted great! North also has a great vino selection which we loved to see.  Unfortunately, being filled with za and wine left no room for dinner.  The bright side we'll have to go back again soon because everything on the dinner menu sounded awesome.  Cool atmosphere, very industrial modern, and the staff are great!"}
{"text":"Went to north Italia with a group of friends Saturday night. We made a reservation and when we arrived, the place was pretty packed at 9pm. The decor is super sleek and cute inside. We were seated shortly after ordering drinks at the bar. Service was pretty good. Since I think this is a new location, they are still training staff.   Our party of 8 almost ordered most of the menu. For appetizers we got the arancini balls and calamari. I liked that the calamari came with arugula because it made it lighter but that dish was a miss for the table. They were expecting just calamari and more of it. The calamari was crispy but it didn't come with any dipping sauces. My friends said the arancini balls were just ok.   I ordered the funghi pizza. I love mushrooms and this pizza was very very good. It had great flavor and they were pretty generous with the mushrooms. The only complaints were that the crust is too big and thick, and the pizza was on the greasy side.   I also got to try some of the chicken pesto. It's very flavorful. The short rib pasta was good but the meat was a little stringy. I did enjoy the Parmesan cream sauce though.  The diver scallops came on a bed of risotto with butternut squash. The scallops were very juicy and big. It could have had a crispier sear to it. The risotto was good but overall the dish is on the sweet side.   The atmosphere is great and the food is satisfying so I'll come back again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come quite often and have dinner at the bar. Service is fast and friendly. We have tried so many things including the aranchini balls, zucchini chips which aren't my favorite appetizers but my husband likes them. My personal favorite appetizers are the burrata & the prosciutto bruschetta. Now my favorite entrees are the salmon or scallops. My husband raves about short rib pasta and the chicken parm. For dessert, we are usually too full by this point but we tried the salted caramel budino which was amazing."}
{"text":"Yo, this place is lit. There spaghetti is literally so good. There margarita pizza is super good, for sure 10/10. Plz don't even try me on the desserts. Plz go here and support good food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Has a very trendy vibe without being stuffy. Service was extremely impressive. Our server Fernando was very knowledgeable of the menu and gave us some great suggestions. The only thing that outdid the service was the food...excellent. A very unique spin on short ribs. I've had many short rib dishes and this ranked up there as one of the best. The \"not your typical\" chicken lasagna is also a solid choice.   Show up early and grab a drink in bar north. Bar north also has a nice vibe, but the main restaurant is more happening and has an overall more trendy vibe. If you're going to sit inside, we prefer the main dining room rather than the bar north dining room (same menu at both though). If you make a reservation and want to sit in the main dining room, make sure you request it specifically."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in Summerlin. We were recommended by friends and told to get the calamari. We did and it was great. Our server was pleasant and informative. We all ordered four different pasta dishes. The kids spaghetti was as big as an adult order. The pesto and braised beef was flavorful and filling. No bread needed at this restaurant. The desert donuts were a little different. The ricotta dip was not good. Everything else was great."}
{"text":"Always a great meal and wonderful experience here, and Bar North in the back is a great hidden gem of a place for cocktails."}
{"text":"This place has just gotten better for me since I first began coming here shortly after it opened.  Things I especially enjoy are their zucca chips, smashed tomato pizza (a chef's special that night), the spicy pasta with shrimp, and the happy hour - Oh the happy hour!  It is great, and goes all day long on Sunday.  Tremendous value and easily can get out for under $40 for a complete meal for 2 including wine if you take advantage of the specials.  I have also enjoyed several brunches here - they have a great patio with a fireplace for cold nights."}
{"text":"Lately, I've made a habit of going to Bar North for lunch (love it for meetings) and casual dinner.  Mainly because of the friendly staff and also the open layout/sleek atmosphere and simple but ample-enough menu.  Yes, Bar North is part of a big corporate co. (Fox Concepts), but they do a good job of creating an intimate and unique spot (lived in NYC long enough; plenty of unique eateries there, still can appreciate BarNorth; again, it's really the staff that makes this place).   Same menu for both lunch and dinner, with just a few big plates and a nice selection of small plates (though they mentioned they'll be doing something new for the summer) and they do have a full bar.  For nights out, we're able to coordinate the busy people we want to see, since this place is great for after-dinner \"camping\" at one of the large outdoor lounge tables and inviting friends to stop by, at no set time, to oder at our table (no pressure to make a big production) or just grab appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"Honestly giving this place 5 stars because everything was top notch for me this night. Service was two thumbs up. Very kind people. My server was very patient and helpful in offering his thoughts and what he thought I would enjoy. And my salad was absolutely the best salad I'd ever had in my life?! It was a roasted vegetable salad. So so good. I'd go back just for that salad. Next I had the mushroom tortellini. Very good. And I'm a picky girl when it comes to tortellini. Very small dish however. I only got maybe 8 tortellinis. But it's okay because I had also ordered the arancini which was very good and I loved how they were smothered in marinara sauce. Lastly I cannot remember the name of this cocktail but it was the wine mixed cocktail and was very good. The Ambiance of this restaurant was what I would've hoped for from the outside. Very vibey and lax but so appealing to the younger classier crowd I would say. Also they offer valet. Will definitely go back and this time maybe sit at their beautifully set up bar. One of my favorite fox concepts restaurants by far!!"}
{"text":"I'm actually kind of sad this my first review of this FRC joint since we are FREQUENT customers and love North!! Tonight's dinner was absolutely delicious, as usual, from the garlic bread and meatballs - which are the most scrumptious and moist meatball I've ever eaten - to the chicken Parmesan I had for dinner which is super hearty and the best!! The setting in the restaurant is beautifully designed with comfortable seating and awesome staff! We even come here so often for brunch that we know most of the staff and have even created a special menu ordering option for one of their brunch sandwiches! The creme de la creme and our current  jewel of the FRC family!! Come here quick! Hand made pastas and delicious pizzas too!!"}
{"text":"Spaghetti and meatball is so good.  Home made meatballs and sauce.  Squid ink pasta is also good and spicy.  Wish they had this quality of food in nyc."}
{"text":"Went there with co-workers for dinner after a long day of meetings. Really enjoyed the staff as they were friendly and enjoyed a good laugh with our table.  The food was great. We share the Crispy Calamari and Italian Meatballs. Both were good, but I have to say the meatballs were amazing. Really enjoyed these small plates.  Main coarse was one of their homemade pasta dishes which was excellent, nothing to complain about with the food.  My only concern was the noise level of the place, a bit louder then I had hoped. I would say this was because the bar and dining area are very close together and it was just after work, so the after work crowd was in full effect!  I would definitely recommend this place to others and enjoyed my dining experience."}
{"text":"I love North! Everything I have ever tried here has been delicious. I especially like the Zucca chips, pizzas, the short ribs and fingerling potatoes. The happy hour spaghetti and meatballs is a steal for $5 but a bit salty.   I also finally tried brunch this weekend and it was just as good as lunch and dinner. I had the fried egg sandwich and it was perfect. I sampled my friend's prosciutto and spinach omelette and it was perfectly cooked.  I highly recommend visiting on Sundays. Sundays feature happy hour all day and half price bottles of wine. The patio is perfect for Sunday funday drinking!"}
{"text":"North is one of our favorite restaurants. The Zucca chips are the best. I have never tried anything that even come close to the yummieness of these. They are flash fried zucchini, shaved razor thin. You can eat a whole bowl and not get full. The wine here is always good. The risotto is really close to \"moms\".  We have always have gotten really lucky and received a secluded table in the back, they are more romantic.  The dessert is pretty standard, not bad, just not spectacular."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at north! Amazing atmosphere and great service. The parking seems to be a hassle but I think that's why they have valet. We came for lunch and seated immediately. We then all proceeded to order a salad and were absolutely thrilled when they came out. I got the seasonal with salmon! Absolutely perfect choice for a light lunch! I will be back to try larger portions or I might just have to stick to the salad!!"}
{"text":"Love LOVE this charming restaurant. The outdoor patio is intimate, service is inconsistently excellent. The food is fresh and always presented beautifully. You really can't go wrong with anything you order, delicious and nice size portions."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of North Kierland, but this was my first time at North Arcadia. Other than the decor of this restaurant (which was beautiful and cool) I was totally underwhelmed. We were there for lunch and we were about the 4th/5th table seated as we were there before 11:30.  There was nothing offensive, but the service was really slow and had a bit of an attitude. The zucca chips (one of my favorites at North Kierland) were over cooked. The $17 lunch portion of bucatini with meatballs was pretty small in size for the price. Nothing here was terrible, but out the door we were at $59.00 for 3 people for lunch with no drinks. Just saying you should go have a less than $20/person lunch at a much better place nearby like T. Cook's or Coup des Tartes."}
{"text":"Dishes were very small. We got a salad that the waiter said should feed 2-3 people and we received 1 small bowl size of salad which ended up feeding one person and not ge. We ordered a Caesar salad and pasta bowls. The spaghetti dishes we ordered were underdone and not very appetizing. Not worth the hype nor the money.  Service was okay and desserts were phenomenal. We ordered the Carmel desert and the dark chocolate tart. However, we will not be coming again."}
{"text":"I brought my family here for my birthday dinner on 2/10 as a recommendation from a friend. The first thing I thought was weird was that my reservation was for 6:45 and at 6:40 they called and asked if I was still coming, even after I confirmed via their text service earlier that day. The party was only 5 on the reservation so it wasn't like they were confirming a massive party. Next, we ordered a bottle of wine and the waitress spilled it on my mom. Not only did my mom have to ask for napkins after she was spilled on, the waitress didn't comp the bottle or at the very least didn't get us a new bottle when she was the one who spilled it. Next, she brought us the wine but the other two people who ordered beers didn't get their beers for 40 minutes, until the food came. Very strange and poor service. The waitress was training someone the entire time. I understand that everyone needs to be trained but maybe they should have someone train that knows more of what they are doing. I give 2 stars because the FOOD was AMAZING. We ordered 5 entrees and 4 appetizers. All to die for. I would only recommend this place if you can get a good server."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best meatballs ever. Beautiful fire place. Delicious food and amazing drinks. Perfect for lunch or dinner.have to bring my mom here .She would love that food and ambiance"}
{"text":"Whoa , amazing customer service here at North Italia.  We stared the night with some vine the have a bottle pricing very reasonable and appetizer of meat balls.  It come with 6 meatballs and two garlic breads.  Very fresh and homemade.  For or entree I had roasted chicken with veggies. It was cooked to perfection. Super juicy and not dry at all.  My girlfriend had the roasted salmon which it had a base of white beans very different and unique that I never tried before. It pair extremely well with the salmon.  We hate it that we didn't have room for dessert or fr she pasta that they made in house. So I'm dying to go back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"The idea of bestowing gastronomic excellence inexpensively is breaking the rules.   A lavish restaurant which expends decadence upon patrons looking to dine, drink, chat and simply decompress. The building looks like a traditional yet modern farm architecture that kinda hovers between past and future, fancy and country. A loving tribute to an ancient noble farmer somewhere from a Tuscany hillside, Italy.  For a late lunch there is great activity. Locals today really care about their personal appearance and image. Everyone looks especially proud. I sat at the bar in the open air and ordered a Peroni Lager, 5. a light crisp Italian beer with a gentle flavor. My water was brought to me in a clear 500ml \"Grolsch\" swing top bottle with a clean glass. Even using a lemon as a paper weight for my tab was remarkable.   For my lunch I enjoyed a serious salumeria panini. Italian cured dry salami with mortadella, an Italian sausage. Roasted peppers and melted provolone. And I must mention the garlic bread. On the side was a small bowl of what looked like a spring mix pesto salad. 10.  This neighborly place with its kitchen sure was central to my heart and mind this afternoon.   Complimenti alla cuoca, Alla Salute!"}
{"text":"This restaurant did not disappointed from the excellent service to the excellent food. We got the meatballs which were in this wonderful tomato sauce!! The meatballs consistency was perfect blend. Then we got the garlic truffle bread... omg I cannot express how delicious this garlic bread tasted, then I ordered the margarita pizza which I was so full from the other food I could only eat s couple of bites. But... it was fabulous  I'm going to go back on Sunday to try their Home made pasta and 1/2 price wine bottle. We told the mgr  About our excellent service and we said he was going to buy our server dinner tonight! I love that recognition."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! Our waitress was super nice & staff was very friendly!!!We ordered half margarita & half pig pizza so good!! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for modern Italian dishes. We received wonderful service from the entire staff from beginning to end. I would also highly recommend truffle garlic bread and bolognese!"}
{"text":"My party of 3 came here for the all day Sunday happy hour.  We ended up ordering one of every food item from the HH menu and the Bolognese from the regular menu.  I also took advantage of their reduced price Sangria and had a couple glasses.  All around yummy!  I wasn't sure what to expect but I was impressed.  The service was excellent and our server was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu.  We were curious about a few of the items and she didn't miss a beat.  She explained in great detail and in a way that was very easy to understand.  I wish I had gotten her name because she deserves a shout out.  The stand out item for me were the daily pizza that was offered.  It was a white pizza with prosciutto, arugula, and onions.  I would say it was the size of a large personal pizza but can be shared.  This is now my favorite pizza and will be something I'll be looking for at other pizza/Italian places I go to.  I think I could make an excuse to come back here just for that pizza.  The zucca chips were addictive but we got more zucca flakes than actual chips.  They are really delicate and crispy and a lot of them were broken into flakes when it was dropped off.  This won't deter me from ordering this again.  My hubby was the one who ordered the Bolognese and it's his favorite Bolognese he's had anywhere.  He shared a bite with me and I liked it a lot and I usually don't like pasta with meat sauce.  The fresh made pasta makes a world of difference.  I don't see myself coming here for regular dinner but I would love to return for more happy hour meals."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. Ordered $18 ravioli that tasted average but EXTREMELY MISERLY portions. About 10-12 ravioli total. I was embarrassed when they brought me my food. Anyone who orders this dish is leaving hungry. Luckily there is a jackinthebox down the street. Wrote an email to Fox expressing my discontent and surprise, no response. I cannot recommend this overpriced, average taste, miserly portioned restaurant."}
{"text":"My first time at this spot and it was very good! I loved the laid back atmosphere and the cocktails! Had appetizers yucca chips? I think that's how you spell it, they were very tasty and the pizza was pretty good also. The owner introduced himself and ask how everything was, you can tell he wanted to make sure everyone who comes into his establishment has a good experience. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Really great food. Love the Zuca chips and the meatballs. My mom and I split those and a pizza with wine. The happy hour all day on Sunday is awesome so the pizza and wine was $20. Kind of annoying that the bathroom is outside and only has 2 stalls. Cute little restaurant otherwise. Flies also kind of sucked. They were everywhere. But overall, good food."}
{"text":"The Zuca chips are amazing. Service was so slow for mostly salads on a work day. Paul (I believe that was his name) was very helpful though in coming over and chatting with us about the issues. Overall, the food is great. The Italian farm salad was fantastic. The server had a funky thumbnail though that looked really dirty... Not something you want to see if someone serving your food to you."}
{"text":"This place is AH-MAZING!!! Can't wait to go back.  We went here for our 3rd anniversary dinner and I'm very glad we did.   SERVICE-Our waitress was VERY knowledgeable about the menu. She was great at first but when it got busy she completely forgot about us. By the end she seemed more interested in doing roll-ups to get out early rather than paying attention to her tables.  FOOD-  Appetizer: we had the grilled artichoke. The flavor was spot on--BUT it was WAY over cooked.  Entrees: We ordered the Gnocchi w/ Braised Beef in a light Horseradish Cream Sauce, it was FANTASTIC!! I could have licked the bowl it was so damn good--but I was in public. We also ordered the pizza w/ egg, potato, and bacon on it. It was like breakfast on a pizza and man that was a great breakfast pizza. We will definitely be going back just for the pizza. Dessert- Lemon Donuts. OMG so good.  GO HERE IF YOUR EVEN DEBATING IT! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"First time here, will be coming back. Great atmosphere. I sat outside with my girlfriends and there were heating lamps which made it nice when it was cold. I noticed that the outside was pavement instead of sand (when I passed by before it used to be sand), which was nicer. You have to valet, it's complimentary - do not try to park across the street, they will tow you. I never experienced it, but I shop at the Fresh N Easy across the street and have seen cars get towed. I ordered a pasta dish and shared a cheese plate with my friends. The food was amazing and the service was great. If you go, you must also try the dessert, it's so much yummy-ness packed in a jar."}
{"text":"Mmmm is all I need to say. Everything I had was GOOD: sangria, toasted parmesan bread (make sure to ask for bread!), mussels, simple salad (such good gorgonzola!), and the bolognese pasta. Seriously, excellent quality and reasonable prices, unlike many places around here (like other fox restaurants). The inside is a bit loud, but it is nice and spacious, kind of an industrial-farmhouse vibe. Server was friendly. Not much parking, but valet was easy. I would definitely make this place one of my regular places!"}
{"text":"Returned for my anniversary two weeks ago and it was just as wonderful as the last time I was there. I had the Bolognese, and it was the best I have ever tasted. It was SO flavorful! My husband had the short rib radiatori and it was very good too, but the Bolognese was my absolute favorite.  We had the hazelnut torta, because it was so good the last time I was there and I wanted my husband to try it. It was just as good as the first time. I will definitely be going back. It is a little on the high side for prices, so not a regular thing for us, but for special occasions it will be my go-to place."}
{"text":"Large party for dinner with friends (just make sure to call ahead) but it worked out great. Despite being a growing chain this spot makes you feel like it's it own mom and pop restaurant. The Milano mule is one my fav drinks.  Had the bruschetta to start & followed up with The Pig Pizza as my main course. Pizza was good but need some more flavoring to the sauce and maybe some oregano to give it that pop. Only downside, the AC was pumpin so hard everyone was cold and I think it cooled off my pizza before I could get half way thru it. Would still return!"}
{"text":"This place is located in heart of summerlin. We love going here; especially for brunch."}
{"text":"Good food; Bad Flies; So-So Service.  Tried this place with my family after the June 2012 write-up in Phoenix Magazine.  The restaurant was a little odd to find and the mandatory valet was interesting, but the interior is amazing.  The person(s) who did the building and interior design did a superb job-- the spot is very open, the revealed kitchen is fun (especially for an interested 4 year-old), and the artistic touches and lighting fit perfectly.  Not often I take notice of these kinds of things, but this is an exceptional concept place that way.  We tried the Chef's Board, Burrata Alla Panna (asparagus), Mafaldine (rock shrimp and long noodles), Margherita pizza, and buttered noodles. All were very good, though not remarkable.  Bread is for-charge and the water has an \"interesting\" taste.  The most offending thing was the flies.  We're talking lots of them.  And big ones.  And so persistent you might as well pull them up a chair and plate.    When your little kid asks why there are so many flies an why they have red stripes and such big eyes, something went awry.  A kid should not notice the exoskeletonal features of insects at a nice restaurant.  Odd to constantly brush the flies away, just look around to see every other table doing the same.  It proved to b a sad, asynchronous dance for would-be happy diners.  We skipped dessert just to get away from the bothersome diptera.  If only the service staff was as attentive!  Waitress was middling at best.  Drinks were left unfilled for long periods.  Two plates came out too hot while the pizza was just warm-- our daughter's dish came out so hot that she would have burnt her mouth had my wife not tested first (and singed her tongue).  I also had to ask if there were specials because it wasn't volunteered... Maybe specials are a private and fabulous secret, here.  I didn't order the special soup, so not sure if it was indeed nirvana.  Would visit again if there was reason, but my wife and I agreed walking out that it wouldn't be worth a trip on its own."}
{"text":"It is fantastic food. In an 11 day trip, we dined here 2 times.  I got the Ricotta Gnocchi with short ribs both times.  Unbelievable flavors!  I have had the bolognese last year.  It was simply average although it is says it is a house specialty.  My co-workers had the Fall Lasagna and Strozzapreti and enjoyed it as well.  Wonderful flavors and it was a joy to sit outside during the evening with the warmth of the heaters.    The ambiance of the place is nice.  The staff is friendly enough, but didn't impress me with outstanding service.  I recommend it.  You can always head down to LGO for a little dessert after!"}
{"text":"I cant say enough good things about this place.  Stopped in for Sunday Happy Hour.  Great food, great prices and a great atmosphere!  Pizza and the cheese and meat plate was my favorite.  Super helpful staff.  Id come here everynight if I lived in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, the service its top notch and the atmosphere is wonderful..  I live on my own and luckily live very close to north.. I go there a lot! Most of the time alone and enjoy dinner, wine, & espresso @ the bar.. I know all the bartenders and they are wonderful we all laugh and enjoy the evenings..  All the regulars as myself all know each other and if its not a football game that night we will all move around and sit by one another and laugh and enjoy the great nights.   Enjoy the outside views at night the bar is open cause the great weather.   I cant think of one thing I don't like about this place. They give me this family feel when I come in."}
{"text":"Our FAV Italian spot!! My dad is a native Italian and quite picky, we've taken him to several high end spots and we always compare it to North, North always takes the win!  When we have out of town guests or want to enjoy our meal, we come here! Always great service, EVERYTHING on the menu is worth it!   Their deals are also a big plus! Service is on point and the ambiance is great too!   Love it here!"}
{"text":"Delicious...awesome atmosphere.  Fantastic service.  Went with a large group (9) and no issues.  Weeknight visit.  Everyone was thrilled with their selections."}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  Nice patio for outdoor dining.  Awesome bar. Fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very nice decor with both outdoor and indoor seating  Service was prompt and attentive.  Our first dish was Calamari which was excellent, but the portion was very meager.  We ordered a bottle of Chardonay, which was fine.  The wine list is very pricy.  Bread was never brought to the table. We had to ask for some bread. Two  people at the table ordered the pasta bolongese which was excellent. Two ordered the pasta with short ribs. The beef was fine. but the sauce was a little rich.  The desserts were excellent.  All and All a nice experience for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"2nd time here. It has a cool Cali feel. I like the fountains in front. This time got the board it was good. The only problem we had was the waiters brought us the the wrong things 3 times. I used to work for a restaurant, it's not too difficult to know table #s & the difference between a 4 vs 2 top table. So, I am not sure whose fault that was. It became annoying to be interrupted. It seems the staff needs basic training. Our waitress was polite. The 3rd waiter to bring us the wrong item ( black guy, short hair -only saying to describe) was quite snarky. He said, \"your waitress Jessica said YOU ordered the bread!\" We did not! Lol It seems he wanted to argue. So, he picked up the bread & gave it to the other table, then picked it up again & gave back to us? So, I pointed out in Texas you are not supposed to put down food/drink items off a table & put elsewhere. Once again, he starts to argue with me again. Dear, even if you think you are right, the customer is always right! He could have just said, sorry. I told him, this has happened 3 times! One word UGH. I think couple next to us complained, as a Manager came to their table. No one came to ours. Food is good. Staff could use training. I think next time I go, I will just say yes to all items they put on the table lol. Be sure & sign up for their email club as you get $10 off. I liked North Italia, but with Mesero, Earl's, etc. next door I wontube back for awhile. No Manager replied to last review."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant with awesome services and prices.  The food is really good and we will definitely be coming back for more.    It's conveniently located in the Boca Park shopping center on Charleston and Rampart.  If you like Italian food that will keep you wanting more then check this place out."}
{"text":"Been here more than a handful of times. Actually I stopped in when they were still under construction and was invited to taste some desserts and a have a Chandi. They were amazing. But after that I was never really impressed. The food is mediocre. I love the ambiance here but the menu needs some work."}
{"text":"I love North. I think the atmosphere is awesome. They have a great patio and a nice interior. The wait staff is always polite and helpful. The restaurant is nicely kept and clean. They give you delicious marinated olives and bread with a compound butter on the table, and I really appreciate that. I've tried many meals there.  My favorites include: *Caesar Salad*- Always well balanced. *Italian Salad*- (hold the salami)- A really yummy, acidic salad. Just the way I like it. *Bucatini*- Delicious sauce, pasta always cooked perfectly Al Dente  My husband always gets the *Papperdelle* with Braised Short Ribs. He loves it. The meat is always tender, and it's always bursting with flavor.  Things I've tried that I wasn't crazy about: *Zucca Chips*- they taste just like thin potato chips that are overly fried. Not that interesting. Overrated.  They have Happy Hour all day on Sunday, which discounted food. How fabulous!"}
{"text":"The service staff seemed overwhelmed on a Wednesday evening, so I'd be hesitant to come back on a weekend night. I was with a party of 14 and the service was a little lacking, we really should have had two waiters instead of one. The food and drinks came at different rates making some of us  wonder if our orders were forgotten. I had to remind the server twice about my wine. I guess they don't do bread service? Strange for an Italian restaurant, especially a busy one, where people have a long wait even with reservations. Dessert wasn't offered or mentioned before the checks were arrived, perhaps they were in a hurry to turn the table. And one last thing, they pour wine from little wine carafes into your wine glass which is inefficient for their volume and yet they don't offer freshly grated Parmesan for your pasta at the table. If asked, they will drop off two plastic cups; one of granulated Parmesan and one of dried chili flakes like a common pizza joint. I'm not sure they have their priorities straight and it seems incongruous to their prices and semi high-end menu offerings. All of us at the table were a little surprised by that. But this is a chain restaurant so many things won't really be authentic anyway, I suppose.  Their star specialty, the bolognese pasta was very good. The fresh pasta makes a difference. Everything else I tasted was a little on the salty and oily side. Not sure I'll be back soon, maybe later when/if they've ironed out their service weaknesses."}
{"text":"Our second visit did not disappoint! We got a pizza for take-out and the crust and toppings were perfect and delicious! The caramel budino for dessert was the best decision we've ever made. This place will be on our regular list from now on!"}
{"text":"Salad served on a hot, hot plate.  Pasta so gummy it sort of stuck to my teeth.  I picked the chicken and mushrooms out and left a bowl of gummy pasta.  My wife said her pizza was a salt mine and the crust hard to chew.  In addition the temperature at our table was frigid with The A/C blowing us out of our chairs. Our waiter was excellent but not good enough to make up for a D- experience."}
{"text":"Service it's amazing, they are quick on everything. This place for dinner is a must, love their wine list"}
{"text":"I have dined here twice and love the atmosphere and the decor.  Service was good.  Busy little place with a lot of help shuffling around. Food not so much.  We had the hamburger which was cooked to perfection but not liking the taste.  May have been the tomato jam.  Asked for the potatoes for my side and they mistakenly brought a green salad. Took a while to get the exchange but let me tell you they were good. Smashed pieces of potato cooked to a slight crisp, salty and with fresh Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. The bacon and egg pizza was different but not something I wouldn't crave to come back for.  Second trip the Italian farm salad was oh so good. Pieces of greens, meat and goodies cut to just the right sizes and the dressing was fantastic.  It was a rainy day and I was looking for something comforting so we ordered the meatball sandwich. Didn't hit the spot. Got those scrumptious potatoes again. The Margherita pizza was kind of plain. You would think with a simple pizza you would have tomato on this pizza. Sauce just didn't do it.  Even to try the happy hour looking a bit limited."}
{"text":"Wow, the food has amazing flavor that i can taste it through my stuffy nose. We had the calamari( love the grilled lemon), the Chef's Board had so many flavors and textures, the Strazzapreti and Bolognese were delicious. My husband declared this is his new favorite Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"North is by far my favorite fox concept restaurant or actually my favorite restaurant in the Arcadia neighborhood.  The food is classic, has just the right amount of seasoning and flavor and is priced just right.  The decor is unique and brings a neighborhood feel to the restaurant as does the wait staff.  I have been numerous times and have had nothing short of an amazing experience.  It's never over crowded and the service is always great.    This is a staple for me in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Excellent, homemade Italian.   The Zuc chips are so simple, yet so delicious! The pasta was fantastic - not many places make homemade gnocchi or serve pappardelle. The chocolate pearls on the tiramisu are a wonderful addition to the dessert (definitely share between 2)."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, ambiance and service. We had an amazing time at North tonight, our server Nick was knowledgeable, outgoing and prompt. Chef Jalen and team make some amazing dishes. Always love coming to this spot for great food and service."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Italian meal Ive had outside of Italy. It started with the Zuca chips...its very finely sliced zucchini thats deep fried and perfectly seasoned...i am not a fan of zucchini but i couldnt stop eating these. we then had the Chefs Board...its cheese, prosciutto olives, bread, cheese and these 2 wonderful homemade jams....for my entree I got the squid ink Malfaldin....tremendous!! .my wife got the Strozzipreti....very light and delicious...all the pasta is homemade daily...the pizza, while we didnt order it, looked fantastic...definite must for anyone that likes good authentic northern italian cuisine"}
{"text":"The food was decent as usual, fairly consistent after a year of not eating there. However, the service was deplorable at best. We would've thought that spending $100 for lunch would've warranted decent service. The waitress was more focused on her table of 8 that came in!! I could continue but you get the picture!!"}
{"text":"Home made pastas were excellent, portion sizes are hearty, prices are very reasonable, the tiramisu which is parfait style was delicious and the starters (heirloom tomotoes, proscuitto bruschetta and mussels) were all excellent. We could not fault a single dish. Our favourites were the short rib radiatore, proscuitto bruschetta and the tiramisu. The service is friendly and efficient which is the way we like it. We don't want our server to be overly friendly and familiar. From start to finish it was perfect. Can't wait to come back to Scottsdale to eat at North Italia again!"}
{"text":"I hate writing bad reviews and I try to find the best in the places I go to. There were just too many problems with our brunch at North. The best way for me to explain the 2 stars is to give you a breakdown of our experience.   We arrived at North and right away I have to say that I liked the look of the place. Very cool barn design with tons of windows and a bar that is very inviting. Well things changed as soon as we went in. First off the place was maybe 30% full so there was a ton of seating. We were shocked to hear that there was a 15 minute wait. Now I know a little about the restaurant business and it could have very well been that they were short staffed. I still think it is a much better experience for people to be seated and explain your situation.   While we were waiting outside I decided to go to the bar to get some coffee for us. The bartender didn't acknowledge me and instead decided to help the people that came in after me. I moved down the bar hoping it was because she didn't see me. Well that wasn't it because I got another 5 minutes of her avoiding me like I was Kris Humphries at a Kardashian family reunion.   Finally she took my order to which she tried having two other people fulfill it. Needless to say we were seated before I even got the coffee. Bad service.  Once we were seated things seemed to get better. We had a very nice waiter and he was very quick with getting us drinks and our order. When the food arrived things went downhill again.   My girlfriends eggs were so salty her blood pressure went from 110/60 to 180/120. She only had one bite. Her oatmeal was also missing apples which was a big part of it. She was very disappointed. Mine wasn't much better. My breakfast sandwich is something I could make at home. Very plain roll with overcooked fried egg and two skinny pieces of bacon.  The potatoes were fantastic though. Odd they give you a thick aioli that ruins the potato. Just avoid it.  I can only review this place on its brunch. I haven't been here for dinner and not really sure I will give it another try. The service from the bartender and the very sub-par food makes me want to spend my money elsewhere. There are too many great restaurants in Phoenix that appreciate the business."}
{"text":"Had the bread plate for an appetizer, with a pizza as the main course. Awesome tasted throughout the meal. Service by Kim was awesome too. Great atmosphere, love the fact it all used to be an old carwash!"}
{"text":"I ordered their diver scallops and the scallops and the risotto side dish are really salty. I decided not to ruin my friend's birthday by complaining about my food. I   Am so disappointed that I had to pay 30 dollars for a dish that I did not enjoy a single bit. Will not be come back. Giving this 2 star because the dessert was good, great ambience and our server is good."}
{"text":"This was our first time in and I'll have to say we are joyed to see a new fresh restaurant on the west side of town.  The wife and I are giving North Italia a thumbs up and look forward to our next visit.  -Enjoy"}
{"text":"Great location and food. I tired the bolognese dish and it didn't disappoint. The staff was quick and attentive as were the cooks as my party didn't wait long."}
{"text":"Arancini was an A  Bolonese was lovely  Barolo was a little light for the dish but held up."}
{"text":"Came to North Italia on Sunday for an early lunch with my family and my parents who were visiting from CA.  The decor was really clean and modern and were greeted by friendly staff.  Our server was really attentive to our group the entire meal.  The exciting part of the restaurant was that make fresh noodles!  We ordered the kids chicken cutlet and kids spaghetti, fig and prosciutto pizza, squid ink spicy seafood pasta, kale salad and meatballs.  Our group of 4 adults and 2 kids are plenty and very satisfied!! The real highlights of the meal honestly was the pasta dishes (even the kids spaghetti) and the pizza.  Pasta was al dente with great texture and flavor.  The spicy tomato based sauce for the squid ink pasta honestly wasn't too spicy but flavorful nonetheless, lots of garlic and onion.  The pizza was really good, had the right blend of the salty prosciutto/sweet fig/creamy goat cheese/peppery arugula.  The dough was thin and crispy but had enough chew to each bite.  Pleasant surprise, worth a try!"}
{"text":"Always great good. Strongly recommend their happy hour specials. Also you have to try the zeta chips."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with delicious food! The atmosphere here is amazing! It's the perfect place for a girls night out and a nice family dinner! The restaurant is beautifully decorated and designed. They have an open kitchen so you can see your food being made which is awesome! The staff is also very patient and friendly. We came here for lunch and the place was pretty much dead. But, the next day we stopped by for dinner and the place was PACKED!  Seems like everyone must love the food! Personally, the food was amazing and fresh! All their pasta is homemade which is a major plus! We had ordered a cappuccino, chefs board, zucchini chips, italian farm salad, chicken parmesan, chicken pesto pasta, and Bombolini. We were externally pleased with everything we had ordered! My favorite was the the Italian farm salad, pesto pasta, and the bombolini. I highly recommend this restaurant and I can't wait to dine at North Italia again!"}
{"text":"Overcooked and understaffed. Had high hopes but I  was underwhelmed. Cafeteria chairs, just to give you an idea and set expectations."}
{"text":"I have been seeing this restaurant all over social media and everyone has been talking about it, so I've been dying to go. First, I started out with a dirty chai drink which was exactly what I needed in my life. It had espresso, almond milk, and chai over ice and it's definitely worth getting if you are in the mood for a coffee beverage. For lunch, my mom and I split arancini, calamari, and the vegetable salad. The arancini is basically a fried mushroom risotto ball and it is DELICIOUS! I would go back just for these. The other items were so tasty as well. The pizza and pasta also looked so good, but i just wasn't in the mood for all of that during lunch. Everything is fresh and you can definitely tell. My waiter was Winston and he was so friendly and helpful with the menu. I know I will be coming back to this restaurant all of the time. North Italia is the type of restaurant that Summerlin needed."}
{"text":"It was lunch for four of us, and this is a pretty restaurant inside and out with valet parking. Damn, where'd my $1s go?  We drank iced teas and ate the grilled artichokes before their salads and my pizza arrived. Good artichoke with good fresh and tangy cheese on top and a rich lemony dipping sauce. I love artichokes and grilling them is a top-2 method of preparing them (frying in olive oil being the other). I wouldn't serve the inedible parts of an artichoke to my guests at home, however, and they left the woody parts on this one. *Poor bastard who never had an artichoke before still trying to chew the tough ass outer leaves on his...  Salads look bright and tasty with greens and cold cuts and served on a cutting board.   My pizza is called \"the Pig\" and I thank them for naming this one after me. It had sausage, salami, and soppressata with mozzarella and tomato sauce and it was just what I wanted. Thin crust in the middle, thick at the edges and a little char on it. It was actually larger than I thought it would be so I had to take half of it home to enjoy it another day.  Service was attentive without being overly affectionate and as we were finishing our meal, we got to view some tortellini being hand made in the open kitchen.  Should I tip the valet again?"}
{"text":"Love the vibe; open kitchen in a renovated barn.  I've been here a few times and I always get the same things because they're so good!  Usually started with the Calamari app, lots of arugula which I loved!  I die for the Gnocchi and Short Ribs in a creamy horseradish sauce, yummmm.  My BF always gets the Chicken Parm which fills him up.  Perfect portions and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service and attitude was lousy!  Started withe host - we arrived on time for our 6pm reservation only to be shown to the patio and a table next to the gap in the unsecured awning where the wind was blowing in. I asked to be seated in the main restaurant only to have this rude dude say \"We're booked solid with reservation\" - yeah idiot and I have one. I told him we'll sit at the bar - not ideal but apparently my reservation didn't qualify for an indoor table - the guy was a knob! He checked the bar and said it would be ok - wow, really? Guy was not cordial, did not welcome us and never smiled. Some first impression - I'd can him!  Bartenders barely paid attention to us - it wasn't that busy, the bar was not full but we had to flag them down if we wanted anything - they didn't even refill water glasses unless we asked.  40th St location is much much better.  Lose the attitude boys and I might come back!  Minimal tip, but you earned it!"}
{"text":"After last evening's dinner at North in Arcadia I think I can claim I've hit most of Sam Fox's valley restaurant concepts. While I admire the man's business acumen (build in trendy areas, gentrify via menu name and cooking process what otherwise is a limit selection of food choices, and make sure diners in the dining areas have direct line of sight to the bar), the actual food at any of them is forgettable. North is no different really; it does not offer anything all that wonderful to talk about. The food, essentially, is of medium catering quality. We three diners (encouraged by our server) started with an anti-pasti board of two cheeses, spicy nuts, some kind of chutney, sourdough bread & salt-cured beef. It was alright, but I could have put something this it together at home from groceries picked-up at Trader Joes that would have been better. Two of us had the same (housemade) pasta dish, while one went for the mussels and roast potatoes (both appetizers). We were all underwhelmed by the quality of the ingredients and the flavor. Maybe we made the wrong choices, but we'll never know because we're not going back."}
{"text":"Finally! I've been dying to try this place. My boyfriend and I had dinner here on a Sunday evening after discovering they offer Happy Hour all day. The look and ambience of the restaurant is beautiful and inviting. I love the high ceilings, open kitchen, and large windows. While the valet is nice, I would like to have it be an option instead of forced.   We skipped appetizers and went straight for the pizza. I ordered the Margherita, which was okay. A third of the crust was burnt and the basil was placed sparingly (the worst for me because it's my favorite). My boyfriend ordered The Pig which was delicious! Just a little greasy but that's a given. The dessert menu was hard to choose from but I ended up going for the Olive Oil cake. OH MY GOD that was the best decision I made. I loved the mix of textures and it was a perfect satisfaction to my sweet tooth. Totally recommend!!  Our service was a little slow but our server, Erik, was so sweet. He apologized before we left and thanked us for our patience since it was his first week. It was obvious he was trying his best and it was pretty busy that night. We thought he was great!!  After today I'm eager to be back soon for brunch! And probably again for dinner so I can try a pasta dish!! ;)"}
{"text":"I am updating my review from 2 stars. The manager was kind enough to write a reply to my first review and invite my family and I back in. We ordered the chef's board, kids chicken strips w/ potatoes, & we split a wrap. I must say I am glad we gave this place another chance. The food was excellent. I would order everything again and I will be coming back soon. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was the waiter was just fair, very slow to take our order, never refilled our drinks & not overly friendly.  Great atmosphere & food. I've already recommended to a few family members!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"A wonderful example of a pricier option that's actually worth the extra money. Walking in and seeing an open kitchen is so rad. It's honest--like you know what the restaurant is made of. It's awesome and refreshing to hear a kitchen communicating and being able to see the mechanics of a kitchen staff work their craft--delivering incredible food. Any of the chef boards are amazing, the short rib and gnocchi was heart stopping. If you want fresh food with thoughtful presentation and you want to actually get full, there are few places as good as North to do it at."}
{"text":"This place is a 10.  Go with the calamari On Top of the salad, Yucca Chips, Salad w goat cheese, Salmon, & Short Rib entree w juice & polenta. We had dinner here Mon & came back on Sat. It was so busy we sat at the bar where Justin was most excellent. Manager Jamie was attentive. We are visiting from Maryland & we will be back!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I stopped by North Italia when the initial place we had planned to eat had a long wait. I have to say I'm REALLY glad the other place was so busy because North ended up being fantastic! I had the squid ink pasta it was amazing and my fiance had the Bolognese. We rounded out the evening with TIRAMISU! Do not skip the TIRAMISU! It's to die for!"}
{"text":"Great place, Its loud, packed, EXPENSIVE FOR what you get and only has valet. But, I like and will return. Have only been twice, but since Gaspers burnt  or closed down, this is pry my fav  for Italian in central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great food. We had the scallops and the Tagliatelli with short ribs...and a nice Shiraz....yum. Perfect ending to the weekend!"}
{"text":"I was definitely impressed with the food here. It's like an urban spin on Italian food so sometimes that can go wrong but everything was actually really good. (I didn't know until just now that it was a Fox restaurant, they are all excellent.) I settled on the Mafaldine, a spicy pasta dish with shrimp, which was delicious. My only complaint is that the portion was really small and the shrimp were tiny but I get that the menu is designed to order in courses.  Other favorites at the table were the beet salad, the raviolini, and the pig pizza. In fact the pizza looked so good and I was still hungry so I ordered the verdure pizza to go. Wow, who would've thought that butternut squash, brussell sprouts, and macadamia nuts on a pizza could be so good! And it had that nice char and chewy wood fire crust, amazing. Their food is great but I think the pizza is the ticket here. You really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a Saturday night with a friend. Be prepared for a tight parking situation if you opt out of valet service.  Got right in with no wait on a table for two on the patio, but it felt cramped out there. The atmosphere is as nice as you would expect for a restaurant in the area.  This place keeps the menu simple. One page for appetizers and salads, one page for pizza, pasta and mains, one page for wine and that's it. I like simple menus like this, and I figure everything on it will be the best they can offer. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and the flavor was good but it was too salty, which detracted somewhat. I was sucking down waters the rest of the night at $6 each at our entertainment venue.  Might try this place again, but with so many other options nearby, maybe not."}
{"text":"Great happy hour.  We are old, and arrived early, and didn't stay past the end of happy hour, so I can't review NoRTH's dinner.  4 people, 3 bottles of wine, 3 appetizers, 4 happy hours plates, and all less than $100.  The food is a mix of dishes that are eerily familiar.  The chicken sandwich is very similar to the breakfast sandwich at Olive & Ivy.  The gorgonzola chicken salad is the same salad I've had before at Sauce.  Good dishes, its just strange eating them in a strip mall on the west side.  Would it be worth the money after 6:30 pm, when bottles of wine are not half off?  Probably not, and NoRTH would have received a 3-star rating from me."}
{"text":"Came here on a rainy afternoon, our server was very attentive and food came out fairly fast. We ordered the mussels as an appetizer and i have to say, this is probably my favorite item on the menu, its a must try! I also loved the squid ink pasta, so good! Restaurant ambience was very relaxing as well!"}
{"text":"Food is great fresh and hot. Staff is fantastic. It is a little overpriced but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"A little pricey but not as expensive as the other restaurants in the area. I had the chicken Parm, my wife had the salmon, my kid had the pizza and we all thought the food was delicious.  The peach mixed drinks were also very tasty. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Zucca chips and seasonal salad were amazing. Also, the bread with sun dried tomato butter was out of this world.   We ordered the Funghi pizza as our main item. Unfortunately, it was not the star. The crust was a little think and chewy. Definitely not the thin and crispy style we prefer. The pizza also had onions that seemed out of place. Red onions would have probably fit the pie better.   The decor and atmosphere was appropriate and the staff was friendly. Our check came to about $40 for the chips, salad, pizza, and a glass of wine. I'd definitely recommend this as a decent and affordable lunch place."}
{"text":"Come on out for a good time!  If you've never been to the great old beer halls of Munich or Berlin, here's your chance... with a modern twist, & it's called \"community.\"  From the time we walked through the door to taking our leave an hour later, we were pampered by well chosen & well trained employees who love being your servers.  Oh, about the food:  We chose the better-than-usual happy hour menu of a Marguerita pizza ($10) & the appetizer board ($10).  I had the house Montepulciano red & my partner the Italian coffee in a big cup.  You'll know from the 1st bite that NI's pizza crust is made from scratch & ingredients are finer than usual.  It is also ample for two.  Even if you're both hungry, the 10 interesting appetizers on that board will fill you up... grilled asparagus, Prosciutto, eggplant caviar, cheese (to name a few).  Also offered up is the special appetizer board with a bottle of real decent wine for $20.  And don't forget to take a peak at the main menu because you'll find items for anyone's  taste, & prices to match.   It seems that manager Cole appreciates not only the bottom line ($$) but that engaged employees bring returning customers.  And we were fortunate to have Leonard & Ben (with brains & something to say).    If I could make 2 suggestions they'd be:  a definite singing guitarist on that wonderful indoor patio w/fireplace; and that North Italia add another day to the Mon.-Thur. happy hour.  Everybody else does.  P.S.  We not only dine out for the cuisine, but for the \"experience.\""}
{"text":"Great place for dinner with friends.  Atmosphere was light and fun and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Then you get on to the best part the food and service.  Even if you want a simple pizza or one of there amazing pasta dishes you won't be disappointed.  Have had a few dishes and all great.  Service has been great from host staff wait staff bus boy and bar staff.  Awesome pace to go."}
{"text":"Tonight was a disappointment. We arrived at 6:25 PM. The hostess told us we would have a 15 minute wait for a table. 45 minutes later we were hounding her and got seated. Why can't they just tell you the truth, so you can make an informed decision? Once seated, the service was incredibly slow. I don't fault the server, the restaurant was very busy. But someone is responsible for anticipating that problem and planning for it. The place was apparently understaffed both in the kitchen and the front of the house. I am a FRC fan, and will probably go back, but with so many great restaurants to choose from, it won't be soon."}
{"text":"I'm glad we finally got to try out this wonderful little spot in our neighborhood.   Soon after we were seated, we were greeted by the server who offered up complimentary zucchini chips as it was our first time. While super tasty, the chips were a bit on the salty side.  We ordered the calamari app to start, our first thoughts were that that marinara sauce was missing. However, we soon learned that the calamari didn't need it.. Rested atop lemon vinaigrette arugula, the calamari was very flavorful and tender and the breading was a lot more fresh than other places. Very delicious!  Since I had filled up a lot on the apps, I ordered a Caesar salad. Nothing crazy. My fiancé ordered the bolognese pasta which I sampled..oddly reminded me of having Chef Boy Ardee or Spaghetti O's as a kid. I'm not sure if that's good or bad, but it sure was scrumptious!  Service was superb! There was a lull in getting our food out to which our server addressed and apologized for. He offered us warm bread with vinegar and oil while we waited and also treated us to dessert free of charge after the meal - we totally appreciated this gesture and attention! I feel like a lot of places don't address that type of issue when it happens but it was definitely noticed and we were impressed.  Excited to come back! Keep up the great service :)"}
{"text":"Grab a chefs board and bottle of wine. This is one of my favorite restaurants in AZ. Always amazing food and staff. It's a great date night spot and also a fun place for \"friends night out\". Pizza is also a MUST"}
{"text":"The happy hour is rather amazing and so is their regular menu. Monday through Friday from 3pm-6pm. We stopped in after a friend told us about the great deal. You can get a a pitcher of sangria, or bottle of red/white wine with the chef charcuterie board for $20. The board is huge and is easily worth the price alone.   We had also ordered the margherita pizza, zucc chips, and two more bottles of wine from the happy hour menu. In addition, we ordered the burrata salad and the shaved vegetable salad. It was all delicious. The last salad and the chefs board were the stand outs.   We had also ordered 2 desserts. The hazelnut cake with salted caramel ice cream and the almond tart were both delicious. We also finished with the Last Great Wine Thief and their housemade raspberry lemoncello. If you are not down for solid desserts, the latter items are a perfect substitution."}
{"text":"Food was OK.  The wine list was sub-par.  I travel allot for my company and I did not recognise very many of the brands at all.  I ended up buying the Washington Cabernet for $42 bottle.  What a waste of money!!  Put a damper on the entire meal.    I do not like spending money on the unknown!!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time at North and I must say that the quality of food for the price is great!  My server was Brian tonight as he made my our night that much better.. Brian is very friendly and really seems to enjoy working at this great establishment.   This is a great place for a date, fun, hip, classy and very enjoyable!   By the way, the Chef's Board and the Ducati drink are my favorites along with the Bucatini...  5 stars all the way.  Thanks North!!!"}
{"text":"New gem in Summerlin area!! Truffle Garlic Bread was a bomb yet a bit pricy. Clean environment with friendly servers. The open kitchen looks great cause you get to see how they make fresh noodles from scratch. We tried the farm salad and absolutely loved it! Delicious dressing that would encourage you to eat more vege!! The short rib pasta was good but not to the point that I would jump screaming wow. I do like our dessert choice Tiramisu - perfect texture and just the right amount of flavors. Next time we'll come back to try dinner menu. Eyeing on the risotto and perhaps different dessert choice! Whoever loves Italian food - come out and give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Italian food I've ever tasted outside of Italy, service was impeccable!"}
{"text":"I was very pleased to hear from the company and that they were willing to take what I had to say to heart. I likely will not be returning there but I do appreciate the effort that was made after the fact."}
{"text":"The food was impressive.  The Fox Concept restaurants never seem to disappointment and North proved that again.  For starters we had the Zucchini chips, which were the most addictive things I've had in a long time.  I really wish I had a continuous filling bowl in front of me right now.  They were paper thin, and mildly breaded.    For dinner I had the spaghetti and meatballs.  Whenever I try a new Italian restaurant I always gauge it on how well it makes this dish.  I was really impressed.  The waitress had informed me that the pasta is made in house daily.  The sauce was just light enough, and the meatballs were almost perfect.    It wasn't too busy when we went at 8:30/9pm on a Friday night, so the overall atmosphere was still nice.  I will really like to go back again and try more from the menu."}
{"text":"Nice outdoor seating and best pizza I ever had definitely try eating here you will not regrade it"}
{"text":"My buddy ordered the Bolognese and I ordered the chicken parmesan. This was my first time dining at a fox concept restaurant and to be honest I was fairly impressed. The service was okay there was much room for improvement.  However the highlight of my evening was watching a young lady scraping questionable residue from the bottom of tables before I even finished my meal. So now while I'm enjoying this fantastic Italian cuisine I also have a bad taste of gum in my mouth with my marinara sauce."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had dinner here with my brother and his wife this past Saturday. It was packed outside so we had to sit outside which was fine. If anything it got a little too warm under the heat lamps, but the atmosphere was fine.  Food was very tasty across the board. We had steak and organic chicken on our side of the table both of which were cooked exactly how we wanted them. Juicy and tender.   Service was excellent. Recommended."}
{"text":"This was the second time I have been here. The vegetable salad with the white balsamic vinaigrette dressing is so delicious you would never know it was a healthy choice.  We also had the meatball sandwich with it's amazing homemade bread.  You must try this food!  The wine list is affordable and well versed too.  I was brought a glass that had lipstick on it and also the food for another table was brought to our table.  Cinch up the staff and have it fall in line with the amazing food and this place will deserve five stars."}
{"text":"I ate at North Italia in Irvine, CA where I lived at the time.  Thought I was going to miss it now that I live in Summerlin.  Merry Christmas to me!  North Italia is now in Summerlin!  Not to be missed. Pizza is delicious and the drinks and food is great. The staff is beyond wonderful. Cole, the AM was attentive and friendly. I love the hip vibe of the place. There is also a heated patio with a fireplace. Can't wait to hang with my friends there!"}
{"text":"North is still my favourite for \"modern\" Italian food.  Their pasta dishes are to die for, and their service is consistently good.  I am particularly fond of their cavatelli pasta dish. Prices are in line with the quality delivered but maybe a bit high for their pasta dishes."}
{"text":"so, the food here is ALWAYS good (i highly recommend the scallops, but i might be a little biased). but treatment/service yesterday was the catalyst for the review today. yesterday was mother's day, and we had a reservation. the initial reservation was for outside, and mom wasn't super happy about that (a little too warm for her liking). host/manager? guy was awesome about it. super friendly and nice and moved some things around so that we could move inside. really - he could not have handled it better, and i should have got his name.   but the food is consistently fantastic."}
{"text":"OH. EM. G! I've been hearing so many good things about this place so I've finally decided to make a reservation to go! Definitely make a reservation is your best bet, since they seem to be busy all the time. I went on a Monday night around 7pm and it was filled!   I went with my friend for her birthday and we started off with a glass of wine. I ordered the house Pinot Grigio, the 2nd one on the wine list- which was sweeter, they say. They brought out bread, which how could you say no?! I wish it was hot when they delivered it. But, the oil and vinegar just made it all better.   I then shared the Mediterranean mussels and margherita pizza, which was the perfect amount. The mussels were ok, it was definitely better towards the middle of the pot since the sauce was stirred and simmered on to the mussels. As for the margherita pizza, AMAZING! Perfect amount of cheese and a basil leaf to balance it out.   And last but not least, the salted caramel bundino for dessert, talk about never wanting it to end. It was soooo good!   Definitely must go back, would love to check out happy hour next time!"}
{"text":"NoRTH is always hit or miss with me, but the one on 67th is consistently good.  We went with a group of five and were treated great with excellent food to compliment our awesome server.  We split a bottle of Pino Noir, an artichoke app and a calamari app.   I had a pork tenderloin with Italian potatoes and asparagus for my meal and it was wonderful, absolutely wonderful.  Three people at the table each ordered a pizza and the chef screwed up one of them.  They brought her out the peperoni & onion pizza, boxed it, and promptly brought out the correct sausage & onion pizza.  To compensate us for the order, the waitress even offered us free dessert to take home.    Despite being one of the only tables in the place, we enjoyed the atmosphere on a late Sunday night and we really enjoyed the wonderful service."}
{"text":"My new FAVORITE place!! If you haven't gone to check it out, u need too! Can't wait to go back! I will definitely be a regular here! I recommend the chicken parmigiana or Bolognese.. both are amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious! North never disappoints. Their food is always delicious and consistent. I would recommend their chicken parmesan....it is out of this world! Every thing else I've tried has been great as well but I don't adventure out as much after having their parmesan because it's that good. Their Tiramisu is one of the best I've had! Love this place and would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants in Vegas next to Pasta Mia . I had the spaghetti  and meatballs The red sauce was perfect which made the dish overall everything I expected."}
{"text":"This was a solid 4.5. The food was incredibly good, however, the portions were a tiny bit on the skimpy side. They brought bread, butter and olive oil, crispy and good. We started with the vegetable salad, an order of the cauliflower, both were very tasty, great texture and very fresh. I had the Branzino and its some of the best I've had in a long time. Others had the Scallops and the Risotto and the Bolognese. the service and the atmosphere were great. I will return and try their pizza, it looked really good"}
{"text":"The pasta is out of this world phenomenal. The short rib radiatori is the best pasta dish I have ever had. Atmosphere and vibe are upbeat."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere and delicious food. Upscale and expensive, but well worth it if you are looking for quality ingredients in great culinary dishes. Great service too, valet parking only."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and the food was fantastic! There is a free valet which helps as there seems to be limited parking. Their ice tea is a black/passionfruit blend that was very refreshing. Very trendy decor and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 7:45 but came around 7:30 and they seated us right away. It was busy in the restaurant so it was a bit loud but we didn't mind. Our waiter was very nice and accommodating (I can't remember his name now) but the food was delicious!! We ordered the calamari for appetizer, margherita pizza and chicken pesto pasta for entree and the hazelnut dessert!! All were great choices. The pasta and pizza are all made at the restaurant so you can't go wrong with any of their options. The pizza was pretty big (definitely enough to share) but it was just as good as leftovers the next day. The calamari was delicious served on a bed of greens and it was nice that they split the portion so that we each got our own plate. The dessert was served with vanilla gelato and it was the best way to finish the meal. The service is great, from the hosts to the waiters, I'd definitely recommend North again!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the spinach tortellini and it was to die for. We also ordered the truffle garlic bread and meatballs as an appetizer. Great place for a group! I will definitely go to the Austin location when back in Texas!!"}
{"text":"We eat at this restaurant weekly. The food is fantastic. Best pizza in town. We also receive attention from a welcoming staff. Paul is a fantastic manger and runs a great ship. We will be visiting their new place Dough Bird on 44th and Indian School."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in so long. I'm so glad my boyfriend took me here for a date night. This place change a lot. I love it here.  The decor and rustic feel is so nice. The lightings are my favorite haha.   I had the spicy vegetarian pasta with spinach and pine nuts. So delicious. Omg and there zucchini chips was yummy too. The strawberry Bruschetta was amazing. Hmmm no complaints here. I would go here weekly if I lived closer.   I'll be back"}
{"text":"Great 'birthday week' dinner with my mom, who had already been to North for lunch today.  Started with the burrata alla panna (AMAZING) and bread and cheese (quite good, but not as good as the burrata).  Then had the best salad ever...the heirloom beet salad.  I could eat that salad every day.  It's the perfect salad for me.    Shared the tortolloni, which was good, but I wouldn't get it again, but am glad I tried it.  I will plan to try another pasta another time as the pasta itself was really good.  Shared the bombolini with my mom for dessert, which was good but we were too stuffed to really enjoy it.  However, lemon curd is always a good thing.     Nice atmosphere, close to home, free valet, good food.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I took a group of about 15 clients to North in October. The doors were open and the weather was great. The decor was super cool. Although the staff had put my reservation on the wrong day, it was a Tuesday at 6 so we were able to get a table. The server was really nice, and I have to say the food was DELICIOUS. I think almost everyone at the table really loved the apps, entree, and dessert. I'll be heading back when I feel like Italian food. :)"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing !!!   Had the squid ink pasta where the pasta dough is mixed with squid ink and cooked in a spicy, tomato base sauce!   The fig prosciutto pizza was my favorite !!! The mix of sweetness from the sauce and figs makes a perfect combination with the goat cheese on top!   Also had the calamari for an appetizer and it was very crunchy and tasty with that zesty flavor!   For desserts the hazelnut torta with salted caramel gelato on top, very very delicious and most of all the Salted caramel budino was to die for !!!  For alcoholic beverages , I tried the julietta (floral light refreshing cocktail ) matched well with the mussels appetizer according to the friend i dined with , the sangria was really tasty and just the right amount of sweetness, apricot cocktail  was refreshing too , and most of all the Apple bourbon cocktail was my favorite !! Very soothing and warms the insides really good and the flavor was just cinnamon and Apple and barely taste the bourbon but will feel it later .   The service was great and the servers were attentive ! Overall I will come back and dine here again !!!"}
{"text":"I got engaged to my new fiancé today and had planned on going somewhere very formal to celebrate (we're on vacation.) long story short the more formal and traditional Italian place was closed on mondays. So after looking at several alternatives, I chose this place because of the interesting menu, despite the not so traditional ambiance. I made reservations aight unseen and was not disappointed. It was far more modern and I guess urban than I anticipated but it wasn't pretentious like a lot of modern places. It was just nice. Despite the modern layout, everything was super high quality. The table tops are marble and not wobbly in the least, even outside. The service is serious in a good way as the servers know the menu well and answer questions thoroughly. But most importantly the food is great and incredibly creative. When we go Italian we try to find stuff that we can't find in our hometown and this place nailed it. And everything came at the advice of our wonderful waitress. It's not cheap, but it's not offensively expensive either. We left full and satisfied, feeling like it was money well spent."}
{"text":"I don't do a lot of reviews; compelled to write one for this restaurant. This place is fairly new; converted from a car wash station. Inside was contemporarily beautiful. The food is EXCELLENT and our server Brandon is hands down the most pleasant waiter we've ever had in a long time! He should get a raise soon because we believe he loves his job. The only thing that made me not want to rank this as a 5 star because you are forced to give your keys to the valet; no biggie. Check out this place for the ambiance and great Italian food!!"}
{"text":"I love NoRTH. I especially love NoRTH on Sundays because it's Happy Hour all day! My favorite part of their Sunday Happy Hour is their Chef's Board and a bottle of red/white wine for $20. When it's nice outside, it's fun to sit on the Bar NoRTH patio and people watch the Kierland crowd.    Considering NoRTH is a Sam Fox restaurant, you know it's good. Their Sangria is awesome and they sell it by the pitcher, so you should check that out. I've had both their Seasonal Vegetable salad as well as the Heirloom Beet salad; I like the beet salad better. I've also had the scallop entrée and it was very good. I do not like their zucca chips, because they are fried and I'm not into that."}
{"text":"Time to get real: this place is inconsistent.  First visit was ruined because some putz decided he needed to whoop it up during the World Series thus ruining the dining experience for nearly everyone in the dining room. The management should have stepped in but they chose not to.  The meals that night - \"the pig\" pizza and the bolognase were tasty as were the desserts so the place warranted a second try.  Tonight was the second try. 15-20 min quoted wait mid-evening on a Wednesday. OK. We got seated after about 15 minutes. Server was reasonably prompt. The pig and chicken parm were the orders. The pig tasted like someone had spilled a salt shaker on it. Disappointing. Chick parm was pretty good. It's weird that southern Italian (tomato) dish was accompanied by pasta in a thick cream (northern Italian) sauce. We let our server know we were ready for a to-go box. She promised drink refills and a box. It was nearly 15 minutes before she reappeared. No refill. No box. It was another 5 for a box, no refill and presentation of the check. No offer of dessert. Which, had we not been waiting now some 20 minutes after having finished eating, we would have ordered. It was a full 30 minutes from finishing eating until the check had been signed.  Management unable or unwilling to control an out-of-control diner. A server who abandoned a table. Excessive salt on the pizza. Enough. Done here."}
{"text":"Tried this for lunch one day with a girlfriend. Neither of us had been before. We split the heirloom beet salad and the grilled chicken sandwich. Both were excellent. Service was good and I would definitley go back. It was nice sitting outside and the only negative I have is that the slatted chairs were uncomfortable. I would like to go back just for dessert since the menu looked really good."}
{"text":"Our first time here and so very good. Husband got the roasted salmon and I got the bolognaise and both were extremely good! Great restaurant decor and they have a huge heat d patio area. A refreshing addition to the Summerlin area! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"So good! My friend and I went for Restaurant week and it was amazing. I had the chicken parmagiana, the arancini and the olive oil cake. You will get no complaints from me about food, service or quality. Can't wait to go back sometime soon."}
{"text":"What a great place, nice big outdoor seating area. The servers are friendly and fast. Authentic Italian food that is made fresh to order every time never tasted to good. Start off with the artichoke and the grilled chicken sandwich, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Very rustic,authentic vibe here. My husband and I very much enjoyed our meal and will most definitely be back on another date night"}
{"text":"Pizza was one of the best I've had since I've been in phx. Barn-like space with cool lighting. Bar setup was great and drinks were on point."}
{"text":"Amazing as always. The service is great. The food is delicious. The decor is farm-dreamy. But, what else could you expect from Sam Fox? I'd recommend the chicken (chef worried I didn't have enough sauce first time I ordered it and sought my table out with an additional bowl just in case) or the spaghetti (noodles very clearly made in house and out of this world)."}
{"text":"Wish there was a 0 star option. I would say this had to be the worst service I have ever received, but that would mean I actually received service. My wife and I came in and were told to seat ourselves anywhere we like. Once we seated ourselves, we waited about 5 minutes before receiving menus at which point we requested waters. We received our water orders promptly. We sorted out what we wanted to order and put out menus down - we then waited almost 20 minutes - no one came by for our order. During this time we saw the waiter come by several times and assist those who came in after us. It was quiet and very empty at the time (early afternoon) and there were only 3 other couples in the entire restaurant. There were at least two waiters just standing around and the third made rounds by us a few times and even noticed us try to flag him down - but never came by. After 25 minutes of waiting for someone to take our order we decided to leave and as we walked out, the two waiters standing by the door just smiled smugly and said \"have a nice day\" as we walked out. It seems they were waiting for us to give up and leave on our own. We're not very vocal or confrontational people so they got no lip out of us unfortunately. Aside from this, the place is cozy looking, quiet, clean and easy to find and access. The people working there were the rudest I have ever met though and we were very excited to try a place."}
{"text":"Somehow I didn't even know this place existed, and then my boyfriend's dad asked us to join him there one night for dinner and OH MY GOODNESS, we left feeling full and extremely happy.  First of all, the decor and look of this place is really cool. The ceilings are very high and the patio is relaxing, especially during these beautiful AZ nights in the spring.   To start, I had the Red Sangria. I don't know what it is with me and sangria but their sangria was super yummy! The rest of the table had different glasses of wine and no one complained. For the appetizers, we went with the Crisp Calamari and the Steamed Pei Mussels. The Calamari is more like half salad half calamari but nonetheless delicious! The arugula pairs so well with the calamari, my boyfriend doesn't particularly like arugula but he loved the way it tasted with the calamari. The mussels were perfect and the white wine butter garlic sauce is so good. TIP: If there's extra at the end, save the bowl and order a side of bread to dip in it, you won't regret it!! On another visit I got to try the Grilled Cauliflower. They top it with a fried egg which is great to break the yoke up all over the cauliflower. Creaminess mixed with the savoriness of the cauliflower is a flavor explosion.   For the entrees, my boyfriend and I ordered two dishes and split them both, I highly suggest sharing with a friend so you get to try multiple items!! We went with the Ricotta Gnocchi and Prosciutto Wrapped Pork Tenderloin. The flavors that came from both of these dishes...WOW, just wow. The Gnocchi might be the best gnocchi I've had in AZ. It's so creamy and delicious. I don't even like horseradish but it works to beautifully in this dish. The pork tenderloin was cooked perfectly and sat on a bed of great northern beans. Everything just paired perfectly with each other. Zach's dad ordered the Margherita Pizza and luckily I got to have a couple bites! Their dough and pasta is made fresh daily and you can really tell that it is, it's so fresh!! The pizza tasted refreshing, like they went out back hand picked the tomatoes and basil, and then made a pizza.   Lastly, the desserts. I don't even know where to begin. The Salted Caramel Budino and the Tiramisu. I would take one bit of one, and then have a bite of the other, then repeat. The flavor from each was so unique and vibrant that it did not overpower the flavor of the other dessert, making the one bite repeat possible and successful. The Salted Caramel Budino has me lost for words when it comes to flavor. The sweetness of the caramel paired with the salt is like unicorns prancing on rainbows on your tongue. The Tiramisu is also heavenly delicious. You can't go wrong no matter what you choose!  To sum it up for anyone who doesn't feel like reading the novel I just wrote, check out this restaurant and be prepared to spend some money if you want the full experience. The staff is super friendly and on point. I can't wait to go back to try more dishes!!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few Fox Group restaurants. This was by far the worst experience I've had.   Normally, from my experience, when you go a restaurant owned by a solid restaurant group, you know what you're getting...8/10 food, great ambiance/energy, true to brand, solid service and operations.   In this instance the food was sub-par and the service was brutal. We waited 93 minutes to get our entrees from the time we sat down. Granted we were a group of 10 and it was busy, but this is not an excuse in my opinion for a resto group like this. That's what they're supposed to be good at.   Our salads were wicked. Our pasta was a bit gummy and lacked textures. The pizza was also just  meh."}
{"text":"North offers clean, fresh Italian dishes in an equally clean atmosphere. My pasta was cooked perfectly and had a great blend of sauce, cheese and meat. I wish North were closer to home so that I could come back and try more of their food!"}
{"text":"We walked in to eat and was advised of a 25-30 minute wait. We were told outside was available immediately but we asked for inside and we're happy to wait and were advised they would text us when the table was ready. We went next door to grab some drinks. We waited 30 minutes and thought we were check on our table and noticed all 3 large tables had new people on it. We were told they saw us next door and cancelled our table. No one approached us or asked us anything but they simply assumed we would ditch our reservation and keep them waiting. This is poor customer service to assume this of your customers and you should rethink your methods. Or, did you all have a problem with the way we looked? Either way you all should be ashamed of yourselves.    - follow up - a manager reached out within an hour of me posting this and offered to make things right. We will take them up on in it soon. Nobody is perfect and mistakes happen...rectifying it and offering to make amends I can always appreciate.   - we just visited North again for drinks and apps. Everything was amazing and we had a great time!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place MORE than 5 stars! My daughter and I loved the food. Home made pasta? Yes, please! Our server, Hunter, was extremely attentive and ultra sweet. My daughter is telling me to include that he was kind and generous :)   We arrived without a reservation and the hostess made sure that we were taken care of, and even though it was super busy (we came at 6:30pm, packed house and I can understand why) they had our food served right away.   Will be returning soon!!"}
{"text":"Dinner was enjoyable - even at the bar.   I went with a friend and without reservations so when the bar had 2 seats open we took them. The bartender was great and openly suggested food items.  Burrata Alla Panna - grilled asparagus, caper vinaigrette, toasted almonds and mustard bread crumbs. DELICIOUS! The mozzarella on there was amazing. I ordered the gnocchi and the beef short ribs were very tender and mouth watering.  The service was good by the bartender.  My only bad comment is nobody got our food placement right. Even Amy, the owner, sat our plates down wrong. We even watched another server try to hand our dessert to another customer. We were in seat #1 and #2 at the bar...how can you get that wrong?  It was a great place to people watch.  I would go back and would definitely recommend the wonderful salted caramed budino. The sea salt and caramel were a great combo!"}
{"text":"I've been here 5 times now. Super cute place and delicious food! I don't usually write Yelps but the last time I was here, I felt like I had to. Met the ladies for some wine and apps on the patio. Food came out awesome and our service was amazing! Giana was so personal and attentive and made us laugh!  Will definitely be back and requesting her!!! Thank you Giana and North Italia!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at North this evening.  Like other reviewers, we found it to be nicely casual and excellent.  But I want to note two things.  First, congratulations and thanks to the chef that the Bolognese sauce on the Bolognese pasta was authentic.  In other words, it wasn't heated up with loads of chili peppers or cayenne pepper.  Not every dish in the world needs to be so fiery hot it has no other taste but heat.  This Bolognese sauce was flavorful and rich.  The pasta was a tad overcooked (nowhere near al dente) but still very enjoyable.  And the entrée was served hot, not luke-cold like so many other restaurants serve their food.  Rating - A.  At the suggestion of our server, who was extremely enthusiastic and friendly, we had the Yucca chips to start.  Nice idea, but there was so much salt on them they were basically inedible.  I love fried stuff, but this was just TOO salty. Rating - C-  My companion had the rosemary chicken and loved it.  I sampled the vegetables.  They were very tasty.  Rating - A  So, overall, we will go back, but we will skip the chips.  You should, too."}
{"text":"I've been here several times because some of my frequent dining companions like coming here, however, I have had several sub-par experiences at North. 1. My pesto chicken pasta dish was incredibly over salted. It was sent back and remade, but still incredibly salty. 2. After telling the waitstaff I was lactose intolerant and asking for my dish without cheese, it still came with Parmesan on top. 3. The parking lot is tiny and valet is mandatory, but they are always understaffed so it takes an inordinate amount of time to drop off and retrieve your car. 4. I asked for another dish's cream sauce to be subbed out for a tomato-based sauce and it took 30ish minutes for my party to get its food. I never want to come back."}
{"text":"Was crazy busy tonight. Manager bought us dessert for the long wait - food was great!"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes. A Friday night, starting at the outside bar then moving indoors.  We had to flag down someone at the bar after a full 15 minutes of zero eye contact. While waiting for a table that was to take 10 minutes, the host also avoided us until we stepped up to ask for an update. The bartender that did eventually help us knew her stuff, and is a big part of us sticking around. Great info and great recommendation. Over 40 minutes later, and staying because of the great bartender, we finally sat down.  The area is great and the layout is fun - love the huge patio! - but overall it was... meh. Our main server (we seemed to have a server and a million runners) was personable and *seemed* knowledgeable at first, but there were too many corrections to the information she was giving us on wines and dishes that it became a problem. Asking for help from others during long periods of her absence garnered a lot of \"someone will be right with you\".  Again, most staff were personable but for being sloooow, and the atmosphere was as expected (in the best way). The food was fine, but unremarkable based on the pricing and serving for this area.   We felt there were quite a few - we THINK - unintentional bait-and-switch moments with specials/features and wines. Sell us on something... but then so much was out or changed or not as advertised.   I want to try again because it's close by/convenient and I love the space, but after the actual experience I'm reticent to try again."}
{"text":"FINALLY!!!  A restaurant that has learned that you don't have to cook farro or quinoa in chicken or beef stock!!!!   Thank you so much for the seasonal vegetable salad.  AMAZING combination of everything delicious in a bowl and vegan friendly"}
{"text":"We like North quite a bit and try to get in whenever possible - heads up, this place is always packed for happy hour and dinner so plan accordingly. The happy hour board/pizza plus a bottle of wine can't be beat - that's the real reason to come here. Service is somewhat consistent, but for the love of GOD they need to stop messing with the menu. Word to the wise - don't fix things that aren't broken. Food is not consistent whatsoever and literally things on the menu will change depending on the kitchen staff. It seems that all the cooks have their own interpretation of menu items which frankly leads to disappointment if you like X menu item prepared a certain way."}
{"text":"Ambience and decor is nice! Like Pottery Barn next door threw up in here - I love it.   We came for brunch on a Saturday and were seated right away. Our table shared the chef's board which was amazing. Great starter. And in fact, my favorite dish today. We each ordered something different to have a taste of everything.   The squid ink mafaldine was delicious. Wish it was real squid ink sauce but handmade pasta will do too. The sauce was flavorful, slightly spicy, and more water than saucy.  The Bolognese has had great reviews on here and was recommended by friends. Though it was tasty, I thought it would be better. Maybe all the hype just got to me. Don't get me wrong, the dish was great. But I want to say I've tried better!  The strozzapreti was a pleasant surprise. I totally wasn't going to order it, but my friend did. The truffle flavor was perfect. Just enough salty and savory to do the trick.   The Today's Omelette was also yummy. The crispy potatoes were a hit! Along with the truffle bread. I didn't have too much of this dish but my husband enjoyed it.   And of course, all the pastas were perfectly cooked.   There's so much I want to come back to try. Though brunch ended up pretty expensive, round 1 here turned out great! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place! I was very pleasantly surprised with North! Great ambiance, always busy and bustling. Good service, amazing food. The Bolognese is AMAZING. Pizza crust was perfect. Have an amazing HH too!"}
{"text":"Consistently experience friendly staff and enjoy my dining adventures here. Out of all the FCR choices this has been my favorite. Great brunch option for the weekends. 5$ Bellini or carafe of sangria is the way to start."}
{"text":"The first time I tried to GPS \"North\" Google Maps laughed at me. \"Really Irene? There are hundreds of streets that start with North.\" Despite my lack of inherent navigational guidance I found my way there.   Dinner was a joy with a large group of people. I enjoyed the spinach pasta. Absolutely no feeling of guilt as it was so heavenly. I *did* regret missing Happy Hour. (It runs until 6pm. Wine is $4 a glass! Sangria and beer too!) I loved the ambiance and the incredible space. It was perfectly loud for new friends to have a good time. With gusto!  Fast forward to breakfast and I fell in love with the \"Short Rib Hash\". Eggs are involved. (Mom was doing it wrong all these years.) I forked my way through a gluttonous serving. Then I hoover'd down my neighbor's french toast. (The joys of communal eating.) The Red Rooster drink had just the kick of spice. I might have had two. (Shhh!)  Tonight I enjoyed a true Happy Hour. Vanessa at the bar is just *wonderful*. Full of energy she worked the bar. By that I mean she sprinkled her magic fairy dust and created smiles. (I didn't want to leave! Neither did any of my bar stool neighbors:) Hearing how much I enjoyed dark beers Vanessa offered  a Moretti by La Rossa.   Vanessa is amazing at what she does. North Italia provides excellent fare. Be sure to sample the pizzas! I had the special of the day. The crust is right up there with New York style crisp. Heaven. (And a steal at $8!)  Save me a bar stool during HH. (Two can share a bottle of wine *and* pizza for $20!) I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I only spent about an hour here so I will need to come back again to really get a better feel.  There was  cool chill music playing and the open-ness of the space was nice.  My drink was made well but I can't tell what was maybe missing?  It may have been that everyone was sitting?  I am used to bars with people sitting and standing.  I am a stander so maybe this is why I felt off?  I am interested to see if they get busier, it was pretty quiet for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Food was decent, drinks were good -- and other than my date's $15 glasses of pinot noir, drinks were not too overpriced.  However, for some reason the outdoor patio was closed on this beautiful evening.  I'd definitely go back, but I'd make my date pay next time ;)"}
{"text":"Food was awesome, squeezed us in without a reservation. Baby friendly, want to come back and try the brunch."}
{"text":"The wine list is good and the food was outstanding. The kale salad with salmon is one of the better meals I've had in Scottsdale.   I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I've never written a review for North as it's definitely in our top 5.  We dined for lunch today and took advantage of their Memorial Day 25% off.   It was excellent as usual. We had the Margherita pizza and the Strozzapreti.  I typically bounce between the Strozzapretti, New York steak and the Chicken Ceasar Salad.  All are excellent.  The artichoke is a great app here as well.  When the place is packed it can be a little noisy and some of the two person tables are seated pretty closely together but those are the only minor issues I could point out. I don't really think you can go wrong here.  It's our favorite Fox venue."}
{"text":"Pasta, pizza and creamy desserts......everything made with lots of love right in house. Semi-upscale environment. Large patio with a roaring fire and heaters, allowing you to sit outside during the Arizona winter. Perfect romantic date spot. Phenomenal cheery servers who are passionate about the food. Will definitely return. If you haven't been, it's a must try!"}
{"text":"Great food and staff are so nice.  Truly this was an enjoyable experience from beginning to end.  We love their pizzas, salads and pastas.  They give you great home made bread.  The vibe is upbeat and the decor is pleasant.  You can sit outside or inside.  We like the half booth, half chaired table and really believe the prices on everything are very fair.  Last night we had this arugala and fennel salad plus a pizza.  We thought it was great.  The gal who was our waitress was so pleasant.  It is located in a area of lots of shops so sometimes it is hard to find a place to park.  But they had a valet if we wanted to use that.  Check it out sometime.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent food and some of the best service I have ever experienced.  Great location and atmosphere.  Have a great time!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour.  Excellent service from Jon, fantastic food, chefs board and pizza were great."}
{"text":"I can't believe I never reviewed our favorite restaurant. Ive ate here well over 50 times in the last few years and have never had a bad meal. No seriously, never.   The pizza is amazing! The dough they use is just...special.   Im obessed with olive oil and they have one of the best i've ever had. One random night, i asked them their brand and of course, they give me a huge container to take home...without asking. Now thats service  Patio is cute as well!"}
{"text":"I went here for brunch with the bRUNch group (a group in which you run a 5k and then get rewarded with brunch and beverages) a few weeks ago. Now, maybe I was really hungry from running, but this was pretty delish. I got the short rib hash and it was done right. The eggs were perfectly runny, the short rib was soft and flavorful, the potatoes were good....I'll be honest, I cleaned my plate. The mimosas were also top notch, as was the service. So why only 4 stars? They don't have any pancakes on their menu....why is this important? The husband is allergic to eggs and so he can't have any egg dishes or french toast, but can tolerate pancakes or biscuits and gravy...I wish this place would add some of those items to the menu so I can come here with him! Anyway, if they did that, I would be a regular."}
{"text":"Awesome vibe. Amazing food great for kids. Half priced wine on Sundays is a great deal."}
{"text":"I have been to North Italia for the first time last Monday for dinner with my friends. Wow the restaurant looked good than in the pictures and did not feel like we were in Vegas, seems like in CA. Love the food especially the fresh pasta even the happy hour house pizza was good too. We had couple cocktails and 2 bottles of red wine, they were great. Good quality both drinks and food and also the service! All staff were super friendly and very fun to talk to. We met a male bartender named Polloh(sorry if i spell it wrong) but yeah he was awesome, took a good care of us and had a sexy italian accent lol we loved it here. Love all servers here as well, they were amazing. Will definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place! We ordered the zucca chips that was so good that we had to ordered another serving, chef board is definitely a must to order we love everything in it. SQUID INK MAFALDINE-(white shrimp, calamari, acqua pazza, mint, fennel pollen, calabrian chili) just perfect! SHORT RIB RADIATORI-(parmesan cream, fresh horseradish, wilted arugula, herbed breadcrumb) this pasta is so flavorful, the beef is so tender. BOLOGNESE (HOUSE SPECIALTY-traditional meat sauce, tagliatelle noodle & grana padano cheese) this is the best bolognese I've ever had. We were so full to have dessert. We just love everything we had. Service is really good too."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a 5 star review, but I can't. The truth is I never ate here. One of my customers spoke highly of North. As I do every Monday evening, I try a restaurant that is new to me. The young lady told me she would be expecting Monday evening anytime after 6pm. Great, see you there, I told her. I arrived a bit after 7pm. I was greeted by a very nice young man. This young man is one of their Valet's. Um... right, I don't do valet. I'll just self park. To which he replied, \"There is no self park, we only do valet, 7 days a week and right now the parking lot is full.\"   From a business perspective, a full parking lot is fantastic. On a Monday night to be full is certainly a testimony of how popular this restaurant is. However, from a guest perspective, this is not good. I then told the young man, I would just park next door or across the street. He then warned me that my car would be towed. Great! Since my car is my livelihood, I can't afford that, so what's my solution? I find the local McDonalds and have a $2.50 double cheese burger and well done fries, because at this point I'm pretty pissed. I moved here from California. If your parking lot hasn't enough parking, typically your establishment works a deal with the neighboring businesses for your overflow. Especially when their businesses doesn't operate in the evening. I'm not sure If I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place to go on a nice little date. Not crazy expensive, good atmosphere for a fun date and fantastic food and drinks. Took my girlfriend for her birthday and we enjoyed our meal to a live concert going on right outside. Our waiter was timely and certainly knew how to fill a need when he saw it by offering us things before we even knew we really needed them. Only downfall was parking but that's not their fault at all because it's a bustling area in Kierland"}
{"text":"If you're on the fence, fall on the side of North Italia! This place is wonderful, the ambience is relaxed, yet classy. It's incredibly clean and the staff is always great, friendly, and reliable. The general manager Jamie is a total sweetheart and keeps his ship tight. The bar has indoor/outdoor seating, perfect for the awesome weather we've been blessed with! Today, I had the Seasonal Vegetable salad, exquisitely dressed might I add, with cauliflower, romaine, kale, arugula, golden raisins, dates, farro, marcona almonds, avocado, and it was delightful! I also tried the Arancini, 3 deep fried mushroom risotto balls. Comforting, but not overwhelming. The vegetarian options are really good here, not much in the way of vegan selections, not surprising for an Italian cuisine. Spend the evening here with friends, the wine glasses are waiting for you!"}
{"text":"Excellent food,staff,& managers! My new favorite spot in Summerlin. Well done North Italia"}
{"text":"Spectacular experience. The service was top notch. Not only were they very accommodating, they knew their facts about every dish, drink, and decors purpose. You don't see this type of service anywhere off the strip. Food was mouth watering. Great flavors and pairings. I already can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good food. Better service. Great dish recommended by server. Make sure you get Steve as your server. Or Jessica, she's hot."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the mussels and the cauliflower! The gnocchi was great and their dessert was also phenomenal. There was not 1 thing on the menu I tried that wasn't fantastic!"}
{"text":"Excited to try this place as it always seems so lively and many of my friends love it. I made a reservation via open table to ensure I had a table And that went well. I had a table waiting for me. I asked about a wine and the waitress said she never had it and offered a taste of it and holy cow...that took 20 minutes and then another 20 to get the bottle and another 30 for the food. She kept blaming a back up at the bar...which was seriously empty so i would hate to see what a weekend night that's busy would be like.   Outside of the slow and undesirable service...the food was top notch. This restaurant would make it on food alone and it might just be so good that it would compensate for the miserable service.   The waitress asked if we needed boxes and obviously sees we have a pizza and realized after she brings tiny boxes that....yeah pizza...doesn't quite go in a tiny box. I'm not sure what kind of experience she has in restaurant....but she really needs some training.   I think the front of the house needs work to really nail this. If this restaurant flops, it's because of the front of the house. The food is impeccable. We had some amazing food. A little disappointed that they were out of meatballs though...but every dish was amazing."}
{"text":"I was here last night for a late night bite and it was pretty close to perfect. Our waiter suggested the perfect Malbec and it was wonderful. We shared the chefs board and it was delicious. The prosciutto was perfect. We also got the bambolinis and the affogato. Both were fantastic ways to finish the night! I would 100% recommend this location. The only issue that I ran into was that the hours said that the restaurant would be closed at 11, and at around 9:30 there was only one other group of customers and we felt rushed to eat and settle our tab. It seemed that the staff wanted to leave early so they decided to bring us the check before we had finished our meal. I found that a bit rude and don't particularly enjoy being rushed. The service and food were great aside from that point."}
{"text":"Love this Fox restaurant. The space is beautiful, clean, sparkly,inviting. our waiter, Shane, was friendly, knowledgeable, efficient. Started with the arrancini balls for appy, very tasty fried crusty rice balls oozing cheese, nestled in red sauce. Husband had the P.E.I. Mussels in a luscious wine broth with salami nuggets and grilled bread for sopping. Superb. Entree for me was gnocchi with arugula and beef short ribs. Heaven. Other entree was dubbed \"the pig\" pizza. Fabulous crust with various pork sausages. I stole a piece from hub and have to say one of the best pizzas EVER. Dessert was a salted caramel pudding/mousse type concoction that was the bomb. Sweet touch of salt, creaminess. Sigh. As usual Fox does not disappoint. Great meal, service, surroundings. Not cheap but worth it. Molto bene."}
{"text":"Service is amazing at the bar. Sometimes they are so busy it's hard to get fast food. Take your time and enjoy the atmosphere and food. It's worth it! Very good food but limited me use."}
{"text":"Excellent food, even though the service was slightly slow they went out of their way to make up for it. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"North gas great tortellini and amazing arancini! They also have a tiramisu that is to die for!!! I love the ambiance of the restaurant and it's a great place for a nice night out!"}
{"text":"We have had 2 completely different dining experiences at this restaurant. Our first experience was opening week and a complete disaster. This rating is based off our second try....a great dinner!  The restaurant has awesome indoor and outdoor spaces. It has super trendy decor and is cozy all at the same time.   We did not have reservations, so we had a 40 minute wait on a Friday night. We found seats at the bar and ordered drinks. I ordered a beer and my wife ordered a speciality cocktail. Both were served quickly.  Once seated, we were greeted by our server. She was very friendly and went over all the specials. We ordered the mussels to start with extra bread. The mussels were HUGE and the broth was really flavorful. The extra bread was needed.   For our mains, we ordered the bolognese and chicken parm. The chicken parm was good, but the pasta side that came with, was better. Really comforting. The bolognese was incredible. Something we will absolutely order again.   We ordered the affogatto for dessert. The gelato was creamy and sweet. The chocolate shavings were great with the hot espresso.  The meal was really good. We are looking forward to returning for another great meal."}
{"text":"Very impressive pasta dishes and salads.  Pizzas are good but not gr8.  Menu has tasty small plates and sandwiches.   Love the ambiance and service.  Super bar menu and craft cocktails.  Spacious indoor and outdoor seating.  Gluten free available.  The bolonese and pesto pasta dishes are my favorites."}
{"text":"North has great cocktails, great food, and pretty good service. I feel like we tried all of the appetizers and the fried zucchini was probably the only thing I didn't like. It's such a simple thing, but the bread and butter that came with the pasta was really good. Scallops and fish have been excellent here, but I'm not a huge fan of some of the pasta. The squid ink pasta is in a spicy red tomato sauce which is too much for me. Other than that, North is a great choice, whether you're here for drinks and appetizers or for a full dinner. I just wish they served food later at night too."}
{"text":"It is the first week and training and over staffing are always an issue, especially in Las Vegas where the competition for a good meal and returning guests is at a premium.    But honestly four hostesses at the front of the house and a manager(?) having to identify a guest as either a reservation or walk-in put me off from the start....so the walk-ins must be placed in a different area (?) then being placed between a husband and wife couple who had two unattended children legitimately jumping and screaming for the first half of my meal and a party of 4.5 if you include the baby carrier that was placed in the seat where I had been sitting ...before getting up to go to the bathroom..it is those little lapses that cause me to choose somewhere else. Be consistent and respectful of all of your guests.   I would give them 4.5 stars for the food and the energy of the venue. The presentation is solid, the food is good and the service is attentive.   I am sure I will return."}
{"text":"It was my first time at this delightful place as we were immediately welcomed by Blake. He explained the menu and wine choices, then introduced us to our server. We ordered a bottle of wine to share. It was really tasty! We ordered a salad and pizza. Delicious!! Blake was ever near as it was very busy and our server was swamped. I saw Blake serving food, cleaning tables, and answering questions. I found out he was the manager. I have rarely seen a manager so visible within a restaurant. Usually they come to your table to ask if everything is all right. This manager was working with his staff to make sure everything WOULD BE all right. Well done!!"}
{"text":"We have dined at North Italia for years. Love their food and service. Their is one problem ,however, they have no restroom of their own. Diners must go outside into the public area to use restrooms which are uninviting, small and often not very clean. This is a huge setback for an otherwise perfect setting for a dining experience. Kierland is notorious for providing far too little parking and basically third world restrooms."}
{"text":"Loved it Pasta is what to go for here and the app of mozzarella and bread is awesome. Food is good and consistent t and fun cool vibe to the place"}
{"text":"Not really a good spot if you're vegan as everything has meat or cheese on it. Portions are also rather small but expect to pay a pretty penny.   The atmosphere of this place is somewhat lacking as well...they have an outside patio that is somewhat awkward and tight. I think maybe it felt that way because it was rainy and cold and they had the coverings down with these gigantic heaters that were in the way. They should venture across the way and look how True Foods has their patio set up...the heaters are bolted to the roof and aren't in the way.   As far as good goes, I ordered a salad which was just ok. The portion was rather small and for $16, I'd expect at least a few extra leaves of lettuce in there. The greens and everything were fresh and crisp.   If you're in the mood for some light Italian this is probably your place. If you're a pain in the ass vegan like me, probably skip it and go elsewhere. I wish this place would cater better to dietary needs."}
{"text":"I went here with my son and my mom for my son's early birthday dinner. It was fabulous! Oscar, our server was extremely attentive and friendly. We split the arrancini for an appetizer... the sauce was amazing! My son had the kid's portion of spaghetti and meatballs and even had leftovers to go home. I had the arrugula salad which was dressed with a yummy lemon dressing. My mother had eggplant Parmesan which was huge!!! It wasn't on the menu, but our server made it happen! We ended our meal with a hazelnut torte and my son had the vanilla and chocolate gelato which was on the house for his bday. We left very happy and full!"}
{"text":"We came here earlier in the week for our first time....food and service was great.  We have had Bryan as a server 2x now and he is very courteous and nice. Truly a good guy. Now, for some reason the kitchen is very slow and it is fully staffed. Maybe because it's new. Now, the food was good and I will come back. Just be patient"}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere.  See and be seen at this new Summerlin eatery!   I recommend you make a reservation."}
{"text":"So after my previous review I decided to give North Italia another try.  An email from the Manager got me thinking about another visit. I respect his determination. Anyway, what a difference a week makes. No negatives this visit. The server and supporting wait staff were all on point. Attentive, friendly and professional.  The food was very good and fresh. I had the Salmon and my Husband had the Pesto pasta. Happy to say fresh basil was used.   Not overly garlicky. Overall, quite a nice experience. Good job. Now you should all give it a go?"}
{"text":"I loved this place. The food is delicious and the staff was overly friendly. We had a reservation for 915, but because of delays at the airport we didnt show until 945. The staff sat us, were friendly and didn't mind that we were the last ones there at closing."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner for the first time in 4 years. I sometimes forget North is a more than viable option for Italian food. I think part of it is the valet parking kind of deters me. Anyway, I'm giving them props for consistency. They claim to make all their pasta themselves and it certainly tastes like that. They have good spaghetti bolognese. This most recent visit, I was excited to have their arancini. The crisp rice balls with marinara sauce aren't a typical item on a lot of Phoenix's Italian restaurants. They were warm and crispy. For an entree, I had the stozzapreti with parmesan cream sauce, chicken and mushrooms. I went to Italy a couple months ago and spent more than a week there. I'm no expert but the food at North tasted pretty authentic. I also like that they have zucca (zucchini) chips, which are thin and fried. You can snack and snack on them but they don't have the same filler-effect as bread or potato chips.   The ambience, like most Sam Fox restaurants, feels modern and warm. You can pretty much see people with their grandparents or their hipster friends here. I look forward to bringing a dog to try out their patio when the weather cools down."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. Quick seating. We had the grilled artichoke to start. Great. Lightly salted. Shared the chicken parmesan and the Bolognese. Both were fabulous. Try the Margarita but add a shot of Ameretto to make it smooth. Trevor, our waiter, was great. Very excited about the menu. Fast service and great smile."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant. I am forgiving of new restaurants as they work out glitches. The food is fresh and delicious, the service great, thank you both Oscars. I wanted  to take  a group of people here and called ahead several days ago to see when they could accommodate a party of 8. When I arrived tonight, my 6:30 reservation was booked for 8:30. David immediately stepped in to right the situation. It was customer service at its finest. Great restaurant with top notch customer service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Anytime I've come here, the wait has been too long, the service sub par, and the food underwhelming. To add insult to injury, when the bill comes, your heart drops a bit. A bit disappointing for a Fox restaurant considering I've given almost all the others 5 stars.  There are plenty other places in Scottsdale to go to for a more positive experience and memorable food for the same prices."}
{"text":"Food is great. Portion size is small. Often leaves you getting hungry again before supper time if you've eaten there for lunch. Servers are hit or miss.  Some are fantastic.  Some seem like snobs.  I feel like I'm treated better when I eat there dressed up in a fancy outfit than I am in jeans and a t-shirt, and I don't think it should be that way."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Pasta was fresh. Pizza was a bit salty.  The noise level was super loud that we had a hard time hearing our table guests.  The lights started getting dimmer and dimmer as the night wore on.  I saw some restaurant patrons use their cellphone flashlights to read the menu!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service! I love most Fox Concept restaurants. They just do atmosphere and menus so well. We especially loved my spaghetti and meatballs with the added ricotta and my husband's fire-oven pizza. Yummy! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We stopped by here for lunch and were pleased with our experience. The decor is very clean and modern, and the ceilings are high with an open kitchen, giving the entire place a roomy feel. The dining area can get tight I'm sure during heavy hours, but we came as the lunch rush was winding down, so it wasn't too bad. The servers were on top of everything even with plenty to deal with. It has the feel of a busy, hustle and bustle type of place where you would catch a meal at random or a drink after work. The food was good and about what I expected... tasty but not too complicated. The prices are reasonable because the portions are large. I had a sausage pasta and my wife ordered a California strawberry salad of some sort, but both tasted great and fresh. I'd definitely recommend this place for lunch but it may be too crowded for dinner to be worth it."}
{"text":"This is a good example of consistent, decent quality food.  We come here pretty regularly because it's always consistently good and the service is pretty quick.  I wouldn't say it's outstanding or life-changing food, but the food is above average.  My only reservation to giving it 5 stars is that it's really loud.  If you struggle to hear, I suggest sitting outside on the patio because the dining room can get REALLY loud and it makes it hard to hear the people at your table."}
{"text":"Maybe we just hit an off night for our first go here ... Everyone was raving about this new place & I was so excited to try it !  We ordered quite a selection because we had our 2 adult kids and wanted to taste everything & give them left overs for work . The pastas  were bland & needed salt .    Our first pizza ( spinach and fig ) was beautiful  , but the second was so burnt and thin it didn't even look like it came from the same restaurant!  One person  at  our table had the chicken Parmesan and it was good but the pasta was cold and bland. The pesto was weak ,& our roasted cauliflower was so burnt that it was inedible . The Burrata appetizer was really artistic & great fusion of flavors . (That alone is enough for a light meal ). The doughnut type dessert on lemon was super sugary (crystals not dissolved in the dough ) & tasted like stale grease was used to fry it in .  Our waiter Amos was darling and attentive , so that saved the night . But for the price we paid for dinner ... frustrating to say the least ! I don't usually complain about restaurants , BUT WOW !  Perhaps drinking numbs the palate , because the drinking crowd seemed happy ;) to be fair , I wanted to give 2&1/2 to 3 stars .."}
{"text":"Someone cue \"On An Evening In Rome\" by Dean Martin.   I haven't been to Rome (yet), but this place gave me a little taste of what I vision it to be.  It's located in the little shopping area off the corner of Rampart and Charleston. You'll see a Pottery Barn and Honey Salt. The exterior of this place is super cute - Instagram worthy, if you ask me. They have an outdoor patio with a huge fireplace. I'm sure it looks gorgeous at night.   My friend and I went early on a Sunday afternoon. It was pretty packed, but we were seated right away. We had requested to sit outdoors and I'm glad we did. It was slightly windy, but it didn't take away from the experience. Our sever (I wish I remembered her name) was the sweetest. She gave us a rundown of the menu and even recommended her favorite items. One of options we chose was the Chef's Board. The part that stuck out the most was when the cheese was being described. The male server who gave it to us described it as \"The rebellious cousin of Parmesan cheese.\"  All in all, this place was amazing. My friend and I have already planned to return and order strictly pizza this time."}
{"text":"Last night was AMAZING! It was our first time at North and not only was it delish but it also had fabulous service!  I was debating between the margarita pizza and the fig prosciutto pizza and our waiter Ryan told me to get the fig prosciutto and let me tell you that was the best suggestion ever! The dough was clearly homemade with lots of love and was so incredibly soft I made the whole table try some! And the balance between the salty prosciutto and sweet figs and bitter arugula was out of this world. Then when it came time for dessert we pretty much wanted the whole menu but we ordered the gelato and the donut puffy yummy things that start with a B! Our server Ryan however didn't think that was good enough and brought us his favorite (the olive oil cake). They were all amazing! This place can do no wrong! I would definitely suggest this place to anyone who wants a great environment, Classic Italian food with a twist and awesome service (request Ryan!)"}
{"text":"Came here for a work lunch and it was so good!  The calamari appetizer is amazing.  Not too much breading on the squid.  And it's served with arugula, which is so tasty.  We also got the artichoke appetizer, which was good but not as good as the calamari.  For my entree I ordered the Bolognese.  I felt like $17 was a little high for a little meat sauce on top of noodles, but the noodles were SO GOOD!  they make their pasta fresh every day and you can really taste the difference between fresh pasta and the other kind.  well worth the $17 I think  Also we were able to get in and out in an hour and 15 minutes, which was good since it was a work day"}
{"text":"Since they opened Postino next door, the wait time is much shorter which is a plus for me. The food is consistent and service is fast. North Italia is definitely more family friendly than Postino. I'd recommend the grilled artichoke appetizer and their squid ink pasta. I'd consider replacing their shrimp (rather small and bland) in their pasta dish to other protein options...reason why they didn't get 5 stars from me. Their salad is also wonderful. My other favorite is their mushroom pizza. It all depends on what you are in the mood for, but you can't go wrong at North. Make sure to save room for dessert. Their tiramisu is the best I've had."}
{"text":"Praise their happy hour  their sangria is top notch, the daily pizza today was a spicy salami  sometimes it's something boring but I do like that they rotate their pizza of the day. This continues to be one of my favorite places. I'm a sucker for the strozzapreti pasta as well. It's a creamy Parmesan with spinach, pine nuts and chicken. Try everything in their happy hour if you're hesitant! The meat and cheese board with sangria is a great starter. The price is right"}
{"text":"Good little spot for wine and appetizers especially during happy hour. They have great pizzas pastas and salads. Definitely worth checking out coming in and getting a drink dinner or appetizers"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they first opened and always do a good job on food and drink. It is yet another Fox Concept in Kierland. Food is fresh and cooked to order. They also have happy hour during the week. The staff is always friendly and there to help you with any of your food or drink choices. The hostesses are always attractive outgoing young ladies that pay attention and do their job well. All in all a good spot. Glad to see they're doing well as always and wish some of the other Fox Concepts would follow their model."}
{"text":"The dilapitated carwash-turned-trattoria is a cute concept and was executed well. Almost feels \"local\" except for the fact that it's a Fox concept restaurant and carries the same inauthentic atmosphere as the rest. They did a very nice job reonvating this space and gave it some great curb appeal. But it lacks the true Arcadia genuineness present at it's neighbors' establishments. It's in the food, it's in the people. It's not in NoRTH.  My experiences have been mixed. The first visit was very nice - just there for some small bites and wine. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were incredibly friendly. Food was slightly above mediocre though incredibly salty and oily. Second visit - not so nice. Called ahead to see if they allowed dogs. The hostess put me on hold to confirm and came back with a yes. When we arrived, we were met with a \"um, no.\" They (the manager) were a little (or a lot) snooty about it, so my third visit took a while to come around. Similar to the first with mediocre results.  The bar is beautious with friendly bartenders, so I haven't even bothered with waiting for a table. The front staff always seems a little annoyed that we're even walking in like \"I guess we can be bothered to seat you\" which is why we always just help ourselves to the bar. It's close to home with all day happy hour on Sundays (decent wine), so I'll probably be back eventually. But only if I'm eager to have one of those \"stumble home in a wine stupor\" nights."}
{"text":"I was hungry for some type of seafood so my friend and I came here.  The restaurant has a nice clean feel to it, and seems generally pretty busy.  We didn't have to wait for a table when we were there at about 7pm on a Sunday night.  We got started with the sundried tomato butter that came with our bread on the table.  We each had a glass of wine.  I had a Pinot Grigio, the slightly more expensive one.  I wasn't a huge fan of it though.  We did have the Zucca chips, which were delicious and very addictive.  We easily finished this.  I chose one of the specials, the halibut and my friend had the risotto.  The risotto was quite delcious, but I was very disappointed with my halibut..  It was very bland, and seemed to be seasoned with a little bit of salt.  It came with vegetables that didn't have much flavor either.  I had to ask the waiter for some lemons, but that didn't help that much either.  We were too full to have dessert, but I was too dissatisfied to even try."}
{"text":"Disappointed tonight. Been once before where it was great. Squid ink pasta was cooked perfectly but was cold in parts and had two small prawns and slithers of calamari..disappointing..would have sent it back..but had a corporate group here. Would go elsewhere next time for the price and quality"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday and it was amazing. First, the ambiance and decor was very nice. I love the bar and whole vibe they had going on. We had the zuccachips for an appetizer. They were so good, nice and crispy, which is a nice texture. For my main dish I had the pesto chicken. My dish was probably one of the most excellent dishes I have had in a while. I have a go to Italian restaurant, but I think that North Italia really blew me away. It was so good, and everything was on par, I really enjoyed it. Service was a little slow, but I'd come here again, one of the best experiences I've had in a while."}
{"text":"In a nutshell: the food is very good. We had lunch here twice. The crispy Calamari is different from any other fried calamari I have ever had.  Very crisp and slightly sweet served on a bed of arugula - interesting.  The pizzas and pastas are also spot on. Service is friendly and accommodating. The bar is relaxing and comfortable. Even the restrooms are attractive and super clean.  But if you are in a hurry, pick another place. The kitchen just can't seem to keep pace with the orders. The last time we were there, it took 15 minutes for the appetizer and 20 minutes after the appetizer was finished for our main course. If they can overcome that one problem, this would be a five star restaurant"}
{"text":"I really love the food here. The open kitchen is very clean as are the bathrooms.   Now to the three star dings. The service could definitely be improved. It took 40 minutes to get a house cocktail delivered on the table despite asking three times. It was not swamped at this point in the day by any means. They didn't take it off the bill despite saying they would get the manager to do so. The food came out together for the most part. Sadly this bar issue is the second time it's happened."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic as was the pizza. The meat and cheese board was kinda lame. There weren't enough cheese choices. The was a small ramiken with creamy cheese spread, a hunk of parmesan and I don't think there were any other kinds. The meats were all salami or salumi and then there were some great olives. There were 2 piles of maybe some kind of onion/pepper stuff and some sweet marmalade,maybe? I dunno, not impressive at all for 16 dollars. There were 8 of us and they handled us and our needs with great ease, professionalism and class. We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Love this place.   The garlic truffle bread is unreal, same with the stuffed mushrooms. We had almost ever appetizer on the menu and were not left disappointed.   I had the chicken Parmesan and was sad that I couldn't finish it all. Yes, I was that stuffed.   With it being a similar restaurant to True Food I was expecting similar style food. Completely wow'd be and I would go back in a second!"}
{"text":"I came here twice for lunch on my trip and both times I got the risoto/mushroom balls for apetizer ( I forget what it is called on the menu). This is a fried risotto ball in a red tomato sauce with parmasean cheese on it. It comes with 3 pieces but is great for splitting or just eating on your own. For my main meal I ordered the chicken pesto dish. It is really heavy to eat and they give you a decent portion size, but it is so smooth.  Parking: the parking could be extremely difficult. There are parallel parking spots and normal parking spots but it is in a strip mall so could be difficult to find spots."}
{"text":"If I could only eat at 5 restaurants for the rest of my life, North would be on that list.  Zucchini chips are a delicious must every time, the pastas are made fresh in house, you can watch the goodies for your charcuterie being cut and assembled, great variety of foods and drinks.   Really the only downside, and that's if you can even call it that, is that I have the hardest time limiting the menu down. Everything has been so tasty that I just want to snack on a sampling of the entire menu!"}
{"text":"One of the few Italian restaurants in the valley that make fresh pasta. Food is great but because of the large open windows in the bar sometimes there are flies inside."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable experience. This place is busy so make reservations. Food was fun and service was friendly."}
{"text":"Good food, attentive service (and generally good looking!), and good energy.  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Zucca chips are a necessary part of my visits here, so thin & crispy and I love anything oily or fried.  Clean, contemporary, upscale atmosphere at this Arrowhead location, but the prices aren't too bad (though still a little pricey).  Service is usually good if it's not too busy, and there's often a nice spot at the bar during lunch hour if you're dining solo."}
{"text":"Service was AWFUL!!!! Hosts were rude, servers were frantic, disorganized and lacked wine and menu knowledge. For how busy this place was I was surprised at the quality of service or lack thereof. Salads were bland an uninspired, pasta was not made from scratch and lacked texture and density, my main course was extremely overlooked and presentation was mediocre at best. If you want to try some real Italian food give Masso Osteria at Red Rock a try!!"}
{"text":"Weeknight dinner at end of happy hour (great small plates and wine), so ordered off regular menu due to timing. Bruschetta (tasty with the asparagus and prosciutto), Crisp Calamari (lemon vinegrette salad), Caesar salad (perfectly dressed), Olive oil cake (BEST olive oil cake I've ever tasted--topped with a citrus simple syrup...YUM), and chocolate tart, topped with mousse & toffee pieces (must be a chocolate lover, more of a winter dessert or if craving chocolate) definitely worth trying with your coffee. Beverages - Pinot Grigio and coffee."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best pizza and pasta in all of Summerlin. Eric makes the best cocktails and very professional which is rare for Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Attended as a member of a group.  Service was good - food was really amazing - especially the appetizers and dessert!"}
{"text":"Wow! Little did I know I would go to Arizona and find an awesome Italian restaurant.  I can tell when the taste is beyond good, I've been in great restaurants before...I've even been in Italy, I can tell... This good was so good I pretty much ordered everything on the menu, ate most of it and made me wish I've had a bigger sized stomach.  Seriously, this good is so well done you would not be able to stop eating it.  This was my first time in Arizona and I must say, next time here, I'll be here eating the same amazing food I had.  Meatballs were amazing, so was the Margarita pizza.  I had also artichokes and there was also the truffle chicken pasta,..overall, one of the best places I've been.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"IF, you are 40-60 and looking for a \"double-date\" location, this is your venue.  It's awesome because it is located in Kierland Commons - an up-scale, outdoor, shopping district with plenty of places to spend a buck.   NoRTH has indoor sitting but it's absurdly noisy. Therefore, I would recommend the outdoor patio. Our waitress was amazing and on top of her tables. And for our Arizonian delight, they have outdoor heaters just in case the temperature should drop below 85 degrees. ;)  The trio of spreads appetizer was good (goat cheese=awesome, humus=great, olive spread= ehh?). I had the Buccatini (short ribs with tomato and pasta) for main course. Flavors were there but the presentation was not. The BF ordered the Grilled Ahi and I immediately had entree envy (seared but still very tender- I highly recommend). And if you like Tiramisu, order their Tiramisu.  All of that with a house bottle of Red, $90."}
{"text":"Bleh,  so disappointed in what I considered a sure thing for a good meal.   We live in San Diego and only have one Fox Concept,  True Foods.   I love it and go any chance I get.   First,  the service was mediocre at best,  no excuse for this as the place was packed with staff.   At one point,  I counted 14 people in the kitchen area at once.   I ordered the tomato soup,  the bowl and plate were smoking hot,  so I was quite surprised to have cool soup.   I very nicely told the waitress (who was missing a personality)  and someone else brought it back saying this would be much better...... I almost want to say worse as now it was 1/2 hot and 1/2 cool,  which tells me microwave!!!!!   I ordered the spicey shrimp pasta,  the six or so tiny shrimp were very good,  the pasta was awful and had zero flavor,  so I left it and my dinner consisted of 6 or so shrimp.  My husband had Spaghetti Bolioniase,  which was good.   Guess I will stick to True Foods and leave it at that."}
{"text":"This establishment never misses the mark!  Consistently tasty food and attentive service. My favorite of the Fox restaurants.  Pastas are fresh made and you can taste the difference.  The Chicken Parmesan is a home run!  Best of all are the dessert offerings. Try the lemon doughnut holes. YUM!  Great patio especially this time of the year!"}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night. Place was packed on arrival, and was told to expect a 45 min wait. 5 minutes later, I was told a window table for two was open and I was seated. Waitress was very attentive and checked on me many times as I waited for my date to arrive. Food was very tasty. Night was a success. Will be back. Valet is a little unnecessary as parking lot is small."}
{"text":"Our food was great. We had the appetizer plate with prosciutto cheeses chutney etc. fabulous. Then we split a pizza soooooo good service was great. Loved it."}
{"text":"My whole family and I LOVE this place. From the decor to the food to the service, North is amazing! Last time we were there, the server heard my mom debating between a number of desserts. We ended up ordering two, but the gentleman waiting on us noticed we hadn't chosen one my mom mentioned, so he brought it out on the house! The pasta is obviously homemade and everything we've tried has been WONDERFUL! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Was absolutely amazed at the quality of the food. I love to cook, love to cook Italian, and I can humbly say that this is authentic upscale Italian and better than anything I can orifice at home.  Great dinner with friends, great date place!"}
{"text":"Hipster atmosphere and plenty of house made options. Definitely better than your typical Italian restaurant but not the best. Very noisy and hard to park."}
{"text":"Oh North - you are absolutely delicious. The cocktails were amazing, the appetizers were fantastic (love those chips!) and our entrees were delectable. Dessert was truly a special occasion. Thanks for the great service and the friendly vibe. Oh, and your menu - aaahhh.... yum!!!"}
{"text":"Oh, how I love your way with food, North!! Hip and happening with warm and welcoming service. The cocktails were just delicious and the appies - calamari and artichoke were just yum. We all loved our individual pastas - the bolognese was glorious, and the cauliflower was too good to be true. Pizzas were also phenomenal. Thanks for a great evening!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! My boyfriend and I came for dinner on a Friday night and the food was very good. We ended up arriving right as happy hour was ending and we were lucky enough to find a spot at the bar. The bar atmosphere is amazing, as the bar opens to the outside which gives you a great opportunity to enjoy the patio vibe. The place has a beautiful ambiance!  I started with a cocktail, and ordered the Julietta which is ginger infused vodka, vanilla, st. germain, lime and prosecco. This was such a fun cocktail and very tasty. I highly recommend it!  For food we started with the Chef's Board which includes prosciutto, artisan cheese, marinated eggplant, roasted peppers, olives and almonds. This was a great starter and shareable item. The bread that came with the Chef's Board was a little to crispy, and could do without it being soooo toasted. When then shared a Margherita Pizza, the basil was fresh and there was a good amount of mozzarella.... so you can never go wrong there, came out hot and delicious.   I was a bit disappointed when I went to order a glass of wine and they seemed to be out of every options that I asked for. I was wanting red and all they could offer was white, so I ended up getting the last 2 ounces of a pinot.   Overall the food and atmosphere are wonderful! I know that the restaurant is still new and I can hope that the attentiveness of the service will improve. The staff were all very friendly and kind, but lacking attentiveness, and would forget drink orders all together. Although each time they were very apologetic, it was a bit exhausting. (and when we tried to sympathize by saying this must be a really busy night they responded with no, this is actually slower than normal for a Friday)"}
{"text":"Great food, Melissa did a great job of giving is suggestions and keep cold beer coming. I will be back! Great ambiance, we sat outside by the fire place and were very comfortable."}
{"text":"Sorry, Monica and Ursula but I don't think this was the best pick for the ISC dinner. The food was just ok and I wouldn't say it was particularly authentic Italian. I ordered the Fungi pizza and even though I was expecting exotic mushrooms and caramelized onions what is actually on the pizza is lightly sautéed button mushrooms and white onions. So, pretty much the same as you get at Pizza Hut or Papa Johns. And the smoked mozzarella had a very artificial taste to it, as if it was not actually smoked but had liquid smoke or some other chemical added to it to make it taste smoky.  Don't get me wrong, I still ate half the pizza that night and took the other half home. It wasn't terrible, just not as good as I was hoping. I probably would have given North a solid three stars if it wasn't for the fact that I also ordered a glass of pinot noir for $20. It was a large pour, but that is still probably more than I have ever paid for a glass of wine in a restaurant, including very high end places. I looked it up online and Fox Restaurants partnered with a winery in Oregon to bottle this wine specifically for their restaurants. So I am really confused as to why it was priced so high? Its the most expensive on the list (I didn't know that when I ordered it). Since it was commissioned by Fox it is not available in regular retail channels so I can't compare prices, I just know it was not worth $20 a glass. Its flavor lacked complexity and the wine had very little body to it... it almost tasted watered down (**not accusing anybody of anything, just saying that's what it tasted like**). It was very disappointing.  I liked the casual and open atmosphere of the place and probably would be a fan if I had enjoyed the food and drink more. For me, North falls into the category of \"not worth the money\". Unfortunately, I don't think I will return."}
{"text":"Service was not great. My dish was made wrong twice. And they brought me the wrong meal. Third time's a charm I guess.... until I found a beard hair in my food. It has a cool atmosphere and they comp'd my meal, but would strongly advise looking through your food before eating it, per the beard hair or just find a different place to go to brunch. A friend told me he found hair in his food before I went. Didn't think that would happen to me. They don't wear hairnets at all, even the hairy bearded guy. Not appetizing."}
{"text":"This place is literally the best of all! I've tried so many different pastas and dishes and none of them disappointed me in any way! They all actually were great! Especially their pastas! Not too much sauce but also not too little it's perfect and all so full of flavor!! I love it! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"A friend highly  recommend this restaurant. We were seated and greeted by a friendly server.  We ordered and received our drinks and appetizer timely. However, our meal took over 45 minutes for a salad and  pesto chicken pasta dish.   The server was very apologetic and offered a free dessert.  When we asked for our Diet Pepsi, we asked for very little ice, then no ice.  Both times the sever completely disregarded or didn't hear the request.  When they served the food, my drink was empty and she didn't offer a refill. I had to ask another server to get our server to refill.  Basically after the food was finally dropped, so was the service.  Food was excellent, but experience  was over 2 hours for the 2 of us."}
{"text":"Good, but nothing great. We liked the squid ink pasta, but I've honestly had way better. Trendy spot, probably not something I'd go back to."}
{"text":"Great food, casual atmosphere. The staff was very friendly. I will definitely return the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"The food and drink-Delish. The ambiance-fresh and welcoming.  The staff-friendly, attentive, knowledgeable.  Chris the Manager-exceeded expectations with a special request for a friend.   Enjoy your time, enjoy a great evening and visit North Italia."}
{"text":"When sitting at the bar at 6pm on a Tuesday, it was moderately busy. The barback after about 10 mins came over, threw down 2 menus for me and a friend, and walked off. Not even a \"how are you, I'll be right with you\".  10 more mins go by, both bartender and barback continue to walk by us, serving others and making drink tickets. I had to interrupt him and ask for 2 draft beers. It seemed to be a bother to him. After we had sat there for 20 minutes.  I had to ask someone to order, I had to ask for each beer while they continuously provided horrible service, even had to ask for my tab, a togo box.   Ordered a pig pizza to start, waited 15 mins then ordered 2 pasta dishes. It all came out at the same time ?  Not one single time were we asked did we need anything, how was the food, etc. And we're right in front of you. Me and a friend, $100 tab with the worst service I've had in Vegas. Won't be back.   The food was good, service was horrible."}
{"text":"First time to this location. We've been to their Irvibe, CA several time. Now living in AZ good to know the food and service as good as in CA. Service was excellent. Went Sunday evening with 1/2 wine and drinks. Got a bottle of Male for $20, nice. Our party had the pig pizza (lots of meat), pesto, speghetti, bolognese and tortelloni. All was excellent.  Must get their truffle garlic bread, wonderful. Prices are very reasonable and will return often."}
{"text":"I like North because the food there is consistently good.  The service on the other hand is a hit or miss.  Ate dinner there with the hubs and toddler the other day.  We ordered the burrata and the zucca chips for appetizers.  The zucca chips were delish, as always.  The burrata was  not all that great.  But that's okay - I wanted to try it and I did.  I ordered the Atlantic Salmon which was perfectly cooked and tasted delicious with the butternut squash.  Hubs had the pork tenderloin which was medium rare and cooked to perfection.  I just love the food here.   Service was a bit off for us tonight.  Drinks were not refilled.  Visits to see how we were doing were not very frequent, if at all.  We used a $100 gift card to pay for our meal which came out to $95 and some change.  We also gave her a $20 bill in cash and asked for $5 back - giving her a $15 tip. I was expecting to get my gift card back since there were a few dollars on there but it never came back.  When leaving, I asked if I was going to get my card back but she went on to tell me that she took my balance of my gift card and used it as tip towards herself ON TOP of the $15 that I already gave her.  Normally, I wouldn't mind giving a 20% tip but it was not deserved.  And one thing that IRKS me to no end is when a server ASSUMES that we don't need change back.  That alone made me irritated.    Please tell your servers not to ask if they need change back and don't assume it, either! I overheard another server at the table next to me asking if they needed change back and they said yes!! It's rude!!!"}
{"text":"I am never disappointed when I go to North.  This time around, the hubs and I decided to go to their 40th St & Camelback location as we usually frequent the Kierland location.  This place appeared to be bigger and more open spaced.  We really liked that.  The kitchen itself was also more open which gave a nice feeling all around.  Our server was very attentive and bubbly.  We ordered our usual zucca chips and opted to try the roasted cauliflower appetizer and split their kale salad.  Both were really good and it was nice that they split our salad plate up - and they were still large portions.  For our entree, I ordered the strazzopoli (spelling as I can't remember exactly the name), and the husband ordered the ricotta gnocchi with braised short ribs.  We both really enjoyed our entrees and even made room for dessert!  I think we'll start coming to this location more often as the space was a big factor for us.  We didn't feel like we were eating at other patrons tables.  They do have mandatory complimentary valet so we just tipped a couple of dollars when we left, even though the guy had to walk maybe 10 steps to get our car."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Very cozy restaurant. Definitely will be back. Something fresh in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Nice place nice customer service I didn't like the lasagna it was to liquid but our waiters Kathy was so nice and she bring me the menu again so I choose a salad it's was ok but the Sangria I drink was so so good I think I made me dizzy so excuse my worlds lol, oh she also give us a dessert I got the salty something and it was so good I will come back again"}
{"text":"7 tortellini for $17 dollars. Ok, so this might fly in Arizona but in Vegas welcome to true culinary competition! My main course didn't fill me up at a petite barely over 5ft! No bread with tortellini pasta either? Manager explained that is by request only! That's not Vegas! You need to conform to foodie culinary ways of Vegas! Give this manager ability to be successful! Allow your service professionals to ask guests if they want bread so this restaurant can be successful! It's busy but from the people at the bar it's ok.... make it amazing and give decent portions and offer bread! Let the manager perform magic! He appears extremely customer centered and amazing! Listen to his requests!"}
{"text":"So to start, I'm pretty sure the zucca chips are spinkled with crack.  ADDICTING!!  Those are a must order!!  I ordered a sandwich on a delightfully toasted bread which was served on a nice cutting board and had a great iced tea.  We got our food in absolutely no time at all and the service was super duper quick even at lunch hour.  I would definitely come back here.  Ambiance is great and clean food that reminded me of California cuisine."}
{"text":"We had gotten a gift card for the FOX restaurants. We had about 6 restaurants from which to choose. I decided on the North - Glendale. We made reservations for 6:45 and arrived about 10 min early. They were not busy yet and we were seated at that time. Our waiter was Matthew a very energetic and helpful person. He told us about the special and answered the questions we had for entrées we were considering. My wife decided on the Margherita Pizza and me on the Ahi Tuna. Their pizza is on a very thin crust which is how we prefer it. The Ahi was ordered rare. When our order arrived the waiter said he thought the Ahi may be a little more cooked than I had ordered and offered to take it back if I wanted one less cooked. It was cooked more than I would have liked but I told him it was fine. It was a very nice piece of meat. We had great service. Matthew was very attentive but not overly attentive. All our needs were met and we will definitely go back. The staff is a great group of people. Oh the pizza was very good and more than most would eat at one setting."}
{"text":"North just doesn't do it for me.  I really want to like it, and the two times I have been I have been excited about what I ordered, but in the end it just always falls flat for me.  This last time we went as a group of 5 at around 8 or so on a Sunday night.  The patio had a few scattered tables but the inside was empty and cavernous.  Obviously, we were promptly seated and our waitress came over and took drink orders.    The girl was fantastic, very sweet, and had a great sense of humor.  We ordered a calamari appetizer, an artichoke appetizer, and my dish was the \"not your typical\" chicken lasagna.  I tried some of the calamari but was really irritated that an otherwise crispy exterior is marred by being jumbled among dressing covered field greens.  The taste was good, but presentation was awful.  I didn't try artichoke because I don't like the stuff.  My lasagna dish sounded really good, a deconstructed cheeseless lasagna that consisted of the flat sheet noodles, copious amounts of spinach, a few too many leeks, a teaspoon or so of shredded chicken, a sprinkling of mushrooms, mounds of tomatoes all covered in a super slippery broth like sauce.  This dish is a fail.  It is way too messy to eat and the flavors just don't really work together.  Way too much going on.  I will stick to \"typical\" stuff from now on.  A mistake was made along the way, where an incorrect pizza was made, but it was remedied within minutes and a free dessert was given.  I appreciate when businesses make up for their shortcomings.  I had the nutella moussecake and man oh man was it good.  I have to learn to replicate it.  The strawberries do not make an appropriate garnish though.  Overall, I had a nice experience here, but I think that can be attributed to the company more than anything else.  NoRTH won't ever be my first dining choice, but it wouldn't be my last either."}
{"text":"Well where do I begin? I'd first like to say I'm an occasional customer at this restaurant and it's a little disappointing that when I get there that the options were limited to a three course menu. That's not a bad idea but don't take away your ENTIRE menu! It's not what we came for. That's a little ridiculous you know? To top it all off all I hear is this guy in the kitchen yelling screaming and cursing the entire night and it's on Valentine's Day! Nobody wants to hear that and it was very off putting. The only reason why I didn't put one star is because I do like this place and the food was good."}
{"text":"North in Arcadia is one of my favorite FRCs by far. Every time we visit we really enjoy ourselves. If you haven't tried their happy hours, you're missing out- especially on Sunday =  ALL DAY!   To start things off, I had the phenomenal cinnamon roll (only 3 bucks!) paired with their delicious coffee served in their adorable red mugs. The roll is big enough for sharing, but you probably won't want to. I took the rest of mine home to enjoy with my coffee the next day. :)   Next, I enjoyed a few mimosas and their HH pizza of the day (only 8 bucks!). The pizza that day had pepperoni, tomatoes, zucchini, fresh mozzarella, and balsamic. The dough was very fresh and it's just right - not too thick & not too thin. This is definitely enough for sharing as well. Also, they have a great deal on Sunday- a pizza and bottle of wine = $20!   Not only is the food good, but the atmosphere is spot on. This place is pretty spacious so the wait is never really long AND if there is no outside seating, sitting inside is just as nice. The restaurant is open with lots of natural light and fresh air. PLUS, the service is great!   We'll definitely be back again and I'm looking forward! Thanks North, Arcadia!"}
{"text":"Location: restaurant is well decorated. Parking lot is small, but they do have valet parking available.   Service: We were here for a birthday celebration. It started out wonderfully. The waitress was super friendly and I believe the manager dropped by to say hi too. All parties on the table were here for the first time. The food was great and I was looking forward to write a 5 star review. I even took photos of all the food waiting to upload on yelp as soon as i get home.....until I realized the things they did when the check was paid.   We ordered an appetizer, 4 entrees, 4 desserts and total of 4 drinks. We all tips generously. However, as soon as the bills were paid, the waitress started by cleaning up the plates (understandable). Next stop was to clean up whatever else she could find (napkins etc). Last stop was to take away our water glasses so that we were sitting on an empty table. We didn't expect refill or bother her at all after the bills...but must they do that to kick us out? We were there to celebrate a birthday and wants to spend a little more time together before we all see each other again. Is that too much to ask?   Food: food was great but I am in no mood talking about their food right after the service we got.   Rating: I still give it 2 stars for the food....I am not sure if I want to come back and experience it again. My warning to yelpers: if u don't want them to clean the table and kick u out, don't pay until you are ready to walk out. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Cocktails are good, but not as strong as I would like, lol.   Cauliflower appetizer was surprisingly delicious. A strong citrusy flavor. With some asparagus and eggs on top.   Caesar salad was generic, but good.  Bolognese was savory and tasty.   Strozzapreti felt a tad dry. The chicken was still overpowering the other ingredients imho."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of North. I have been here several times for both lunch and dinner (including Valentine's Day). Their food is very reasonably priced and always delicious. My personal favorite is the pesto chicken pasta (I always say I will get something else but really never do).  Parking lot is small though so get ready to valet or uber."}
{"text":"Went here for date night and it was a gorgeous night out on the patio.  It was half priced wine bottle night, but beware it is only a select number of bottles, not the reserve list, which is why it was not a 5 start review.  I felt that should have been more clear. Nonetheless... the atmosphere is lovely and interesting and the food was decent. It isn't my favorite restaurant in the Valley, and I prefer Greene House to here, but it was nice nonetheless. We sat for a few hours and a few bottles and didn't feel rushed.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Overall the service was spectacular! Alyssa was prompt and kept the meal moving without it feeling rushed! You could tell she loved her job and was informed about the menu! The food on the other hand was nothing to write home about. I one word greasy. The oil on the gnocchi and spare ribs could be soaked up with a towel-gross. The cheese tortellini was overly oily as well. The only good dish was the bolognase which had a great flavor! Dessert was good but agin nothing great - we had the tiramisu. This is a neighborhood joint that I will not frequent again."}
{"text":"Great place! Came here with my family ages 14-80 and we were a big party of 9. Food was really great-- all the appetizers, salads, pizza, pasta we loved it all. Ambience was very pleasant, waitstaff was incredibly patient and helpful with our big group. High recommend!!"}
{"text":"The breakfast pizza was excellent! The only thing I would remind people is they have valet parking here. Other than that, the food was great and I went with some co-workers and no one had any complaints and were impressed with the food"}
{"text":"We had a reservation and they sat us outside on the patio on a cold rainy and windy night (49 degrees) at a dirty table ! We didn't stay.  PS it was my birthday"}
{"text":"I seriously love this restaurant.  It's an awesome contribution to Kierland Commons.  The bar is great- bartenders are always fun.  The menu is superb- I've never had a bad meal here.  I love their homemade chip/crisps things.  They literally melt in your mouth!  It can suck if you want to go there for dinner because you'll have to wait for a table, BUT hanging out in Kierland never sucks.  There's always great people watching!  I really like to sit in their comfy outdoor seating on a summer day and have a cocktail or five!  Their pretty creative with their drinks as well.  Troy the bartender always whips up something new if you ask him for it.  I always have a great time here!"}
{"text":"We (2 of us) went on a Friday night and it was packed. It was a 30 minutes wait, which isn't terrible so we stayed. Usually when we wait we go and grab a drink but after standing at the bar for what seemed like an uncomfortable amount of time with no one acknowledging us we gave up and went to wait outside. We asked a few of the hostesses if there was a way someone was able to get us a drink while we wait and she said our only option was to wait at the bar. We had already tried that with no luck. There was quite a few empty tables so I wasn't sure why there was a wait. After the drink situation I wanted to leave but I knew my boyfriend had wanted to come here for awhile so we stayed. I noticed that a lot of people that came after us got seated before us. I was getting pretty upset but I thought maybe it was due to them having reservations. I was going to get up and ask but then we were seated. Obviously so far my experience wasn't the best but the reason I still gave it 4 stars is because I thought the service, once we sat down was so great! The entire staff works so well together! I've never been to a restaurant where everyone helps each other out the way that they did. Everyone was very nice. Our server was Laura (that's what the bill said so I hope that's correct) and she was great! Always up-selling (which worked!) and she did her job so well. Never got overwhelmed with it being so busy so definitely give some props to her! The restaurant itself is really pretty, trendy. Food was good. Overall, I would come back and I would recommend to friends but if you can, definitely make a reservation or go on a weekday."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd attempt at this restaurant. The place has a good ambiance, our server was friendly and there is absolutely no issue with that. The environment and staff suffers though from a lack of training - on relationship management and courtesy. All the interactions were brief and as if our server was too busy to take any time and explain the menu to us, or interact because I had taken out my brother-in-law, his wife and my wife there.  In addition, the meals were tasty and I had a great Moscow mule for $10 and the short ribs for $25. My wife ordered the bolognese dish with a Petit Syrah which she liked. Prior to that, we had a trio of bruschetta which wasn't bad but may have had slightly undercooked ingredients. The other two in our family  ordered pasta dishes. Needless to say, my wife and I were not very impressed with the size and portions for the price- $178 for 4 people(nearly $50 total per head) after the tip!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have dined at North countless times over the years at the Tucson and Keirland locations and love the concept - casual Modern Italian.  that being said, the 40th street location could use a little work!  The food is good, but the service isn't up to par.  We ordered the charcuterie and the cutting board had a fat crack in it, and the jam from the dish dripped through the crack all over my pants, which is not a huge deal.  BUT, they didn't handle it that well - no sense of urgency, nothing comped, etc.  I don't usually expect a comp, but the table adjacent to us was getting all kinds of comps because of their meal being delayed!  Very weak if you ask me."}
{"text":"This was a very popular spot for many Las Vegans as we visited thinking that it would not be busy. We were wrong. Thankfully, we were served right away because we opted to be seated outside. It was windy and cold, but thank god they had covers that made prevented the draft from entering.   The ambiance was romantic with many guests dining in with significant others. But this was also enjoyed by friends and family as the room was filled with muffled chats from everyone.   Our server was overly friendly as she helped us order our food and checked on us pretty frequently. They really cared that your beverage is filled to the rim so they often came back to refill our drinks when necessary. That was quite impressive for me.   We ordered the Chicken Pesto, Bolognese, and White Truffle Garlic Bread.   Chicken Pesto: I thought the pasta was not cooked thoroughly which made me enjoy the chicken instead. But it was delicious overall. I've always thought pesto didn't taste much so I was happy to learn that they have a different style of pesto that had hints of flavor with this plate. It wasn't too salty and you can taste the hints of garlic with it. Delicious.   Bolognese: Loved the cheese and the meat sauce that went with it. It was simple but heightened in another way as I enjoyed every bite of this meal. Would I order it again? Certainly.   Garlic Bread: I've heard a lot of good things about this plate, but I wasn't too impressed by it. I understand it's made with truffle but that wasn't enough to give it that \"wow\" factor for me. I also thought the side of cheese was a little weird as I couldn't figure out if it was indeed cheese or butter.   Also, serving the garlic bread was delayed as they gave it to the other table next to us. To our surprise, they apologized for the mishap and made a fresh batch, free of charge."}
