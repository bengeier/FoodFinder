{"text":"Cool vibe. Loud late at night. The hostess was the only one I encountered in Montreal that was having trouble with english. We had a drink while we waited for our table. I specifically asked for the drink to be made without an ingredient, and the directions were not followed, which was disappointing. The waiter was friendly enough, but not overbearing. To the food....we had charcutterie, gnocchi, and beef tartar. All of it was very good. The gnocchi was tiny and wasn't the same consistency I'm used to at italian restaurants in NYC, but it tasted good. This place was handy since it's open late...we went after a hockey game. All in all a good experience because the food was very good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a dinner reservation on a Saturday night. We loved the atmosphere--lively, not too overdone or fancy. Our server was also extremely nice.

We shared a small charcuterie board--it was delicious, and HUGE. It's definitely a good portion for two people. We also appreciated the wide variety: mortadella, prosciutto, pickled mushrooms, chicken liver pate, etc.

I ordered the short ribs, which was also a pretty sizeable portion. My only gripe was that they served it with the enormous bone still on the plate, and it was kind of cumbersome to eat around it. The dish also has spaetzle, but I didn't expect fried/crunchy spaetzle.

My boyfriend had the fish special (halibut, I think) which was served on a bed of greens. It was a much lighter dish than mine, which suited him just fine because he wasn't as hungry.

For dessert we had the green tea panacotta. I really loved it because I'm not a fan of super sweet desserts. This had just a touch of sweetness. If you have a bigger sweet tooth there are other desserts to choose from.

We would definitely return here, at least for the charcuterie and the wine selection!"}
{"text":"They're known for their charcuterie plate and it did not disappoint. There's actually so much variety it becomes difficult to identify everything, even after having it all explained by the waiter. Also an incredible whisky and tequila selection if you're into the finer varieties of those (and makes for a wonderful place to have a romantic drink/nightcap). My only caution is the staff (while super friendly) seems to err on the French side. Both times I've been with my girlfriend (who does not speak French) they did their best to explain the menu in English for her, but in neither instance were they really good at doing so. Wasn't a big deal for us, but if you're in from out of town, or just don't speak a word of French, you may have trouble understanding the extensive, sometimes complicated menu. Regardless, I imagine you'll enjoy whatever you end up with :D I forget what we had the 2nd time (we were just having such a great time and enjoying ourselves) but I remember it was all delicious."}
{"text":"Experience was great. Our server was attentive and friendly. We started with the small cheese selection and the small charcuterie. Both were great, although the cheese selection was a lot smaller than we expected. We also ended up waiting for quite a long time to order our entrees (we weren't asked if we were ready to order until after they had cleared the meat and cheeses). 
Within our dining party, we had the Cavatelli pasta dish, veal rib steak, steak, and escargot, bone marrow and mushroom risotto. All were great.
One area of feedback is that the waitress didn't bring us our check for maybe 30 minutes after our meal concluded and our plates were cleared from the table. It may be that they expected us to request that they bring our check.
Biggest complaint was that we were at the restaurant for SO long..perhaps 3.5 hours. If we went back, we would be more forthcoming with our orders and wanting the check so we aren't spending our entire night there."}
{"text":"The food is expensive and tasteless. The staff and atmosphere is nice. We had the duck and the veal and it was not good. The pork appetizer was tasty. Bottom line, if you want drinks and an appetizer this is the place, but if you want dinner, do not eat here."}
{"text":"Last day in Montreal and just happened by this place for brunch. Wow, great find! I had the \"Ricotta pancake, whipped cream and blueberries\". Thick, moist, delicious pancake with, I think, a hint of brandy -- so good.

I also ordered a side of \"Thick bacon\", delicious, maple-cured, slightly smoky, thick, primal-cut slices of pork belly bacon. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"We stopped into Hambar at 10 last night for a late dinner after touring old Montreal. The restaurant and outside bar were lively. My son had the cavatelli which he thought was on the small side for an entree but he said it was delicious. I had a cheese plate and two glasses of Rioja. The service was professional and efficient. It's nice to have such a nice restaurant in the hotel you're staying in."}
{"text":"Arrived late on a Thursday night and the place was bustling.  Ordered the \"death in the afternoon\" absinthe and champagne cocktail and it was delicious and very strong (obviously).

Shared the charcuterie board - it was some of the best I've had, and included house-made mortadella.  For the main I had the lobster with bernaise sauce.  It was quite tasty, but I felt that it could have been better.

I would definitely recommend this place (and if you're staying in the adjoining hotel, it's a no-brainier)."}
{"text":"Poor service. (They won't accommodate anyone with dietary restrictions, service wasn't too friendly and the waitress never came to ask us if we were enjoying our food)"}
{"text":"The worst brunch place EVER! Radioactive bloody Mary's, slow and cranky service, and half the items on the menu not available. Stay home rather than come here."}
{"text":"Le Hambar est situé dans le l'hôtel design, le St Paul. Le décor est chaleureux et distingué avec une belle présence de bois. Le mur de jambons séchés mets les charcuteries à l'avant-plan, cependant il y a un choix pour type de palet. Tous les plats sont exécutés avec minutie et que dire des desserts, tous fait sur place par une pâtissière. Miam miam miam. À retourner!"}
{"text":"We went to Hambar on the recommendation of our hotel concierge after another restaurant, Holder, was closed. We are sure glad we did. 

The food was unpretentious French and Continental. The setting was warm and welcoming on a cold January night. As for the food, everything we had was obviously from very fresh ingredients, and was creatively prepared and presented.

Highlights began with the bread and olive oil, and a simple but delicious butter lettuce salad with lemon vinaigrette. Also terrific was the cavatelli pesto pasta with tiny roma tomatoes. Also noteworthy was the simple flank steak and fries my son had. This is a French staple, but was particularly well-prepared and flavorful. The wine list is quite strong: interesting, broad and reasonably priced. We enjoyed a terrific Alain Graillot Crozes - Hermitage.  

The only downside, which causes me to hold back a star, was a bit of condescending attitude from our waitress. The \"French\" French Canadians need to get over themselves. You don't live in Paris. Don't act like some of those who do. Remember that tourist dollars, especially American tourist dollars, pay most of your salary."}
{"text":"According to my gf and her local friends, the charcuterie board is a must, which after giving it a try, i would have to agree. To start off our meal with a wide variety of meats, liver pate, etc., never fails, especially in montreal!

Afterwards came the savory french toast which i enjoyed. The combination of the savory mushrooms (so good) and the egg with the sweetness of the bread was pleasant to taste. The portion of this dish did surprise me though (not complaining!); my gf and i were stuffed even though we shared the plate.

Our friend tried the salmon tartare which he said was mediocre: alot of dill, very creamy, and nothing out of the ordinary. I cannot attest to whether it was bland or not since i didnt try it myself, but it did look very creamy (in a bad way).

The staff was friendly but service was really slow. There were maybe two other occupied tables besides us, but the food took quite a long time to get to our table and so did the bill (took maybe 20 mins or so)....or maybe im just accustomed to the new york minute."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite after a tour to Quebec City. Food was lackluster. Bar overcharged for scotch charging the same price for JW Red as Black. Management didn't seem to care as they never bothered to respond to an email.

There are too many good other dining options nearby to waste time on this place."}
{"text":"Une belle place sur terrasse en été, bon service attentionné. Parfait pour les 5@7 d'été. Menu et bières quand même dispendieux."}
{"text":"Went New Year's Eve. Food was just ok. Service and decor was excellent. 

Lobster risotto bland. Fried muscles edible. The prosciutto / arugula salad was nice and the mushroom gnocchi the best."}
{"text":"Pour le prix facturé il serait étonnant que vous sortirez enchanté de votre brunch au Hambar. Outre les oeufs Mimosa défraîchis sans grande particularité, peu de plats reliés à la spécialité de la maison. Café sans goût particulier. Sinon soyons tout de même honnête les plats étaient bons au goût."}
{"text":"Great for casual/business dinners, must buy the charcuterie platter."}
{"text":"Had Christmas Day Dinner here with friends (group of 9+baby). I just want to say thank you to the staff who did decide to work on Christmas, it was a surprisingly busy evening. The food was 4 stars, nice presentation. The appetizers and charcuterie platter were amazing. Entrées were a little bit salty and all the flavors in my dish seemed to be a little confusing (pickled mustard seeds + roasted eggplant sauce + sautéed enoki mushroom and bok choy for a veal chop?!)

They were obviously short staffed for the holiday so service was probably not as attentive as it would be on a normal Friday night, but again, thank you and Merry Christmas. I will be back for the grand Charcuterie board and that octopus salad."}
{"text":"One of my personal favorites when visiting Montreal on business trips. It is not an overly large place, but has a simple modern European look to the restaurant. The seating layout consists of a traditional private table seating area, seating at the bar, and then a long wooden high top table that allows closer seating and separates the other two areas. 

I have sat at the high top and the tables. Both are nice areas to dine. If you are looking for a more private experience, then sit at the traditional tables, but I personally have enjoyed the high top table as other guests are seated beside you on a busy night and you can meet some of the local people. 

Hambar is a versatile place in my opinion. It can be a great place to go on a date and enjoy their extensive wine list and deliciously prepared meals, or it could be a good place to go after work to grab a drink at the bar/high top and share a charcuterie platter or appetizer. I have done both and each experience has not disappointed. 

The charcuterie platters here are the best I have had in Montreal. They have a nice variety of freshly sliced meats, pickled items, and pates amongst other items on the wooden boards they are served on that are perfect for sharing and trying some new things. The platters come in a couple of sizes so feel free to scale the size and variety of options depending on the size of your party. I think the charcuterie platters are a must have if you like variety. 

Other than the charcuterie platters, the oysters, appetizers, and main courses are always seasonally fresh, presentationally stunning, and flavorfully rich. I have had several items from here and none have disappointed me yet which is one of the main reasons this restaurant gets 5 stars. The other reason is the value. The dishes aren't cheap which goes with the restaurant style, but they are well priced for the quality of the dishes and portion sizes.

I will continue to return to Hambar on regular trips to Montreal. If you haven't had a chance to dine here or go for some after work drinks and apps, then you should give it a shot."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. The 2nd time was not as impressive as the first. The service is young and lacked the attention received the previous time. I was very impressed the first time not because of the food or the ambiance but because of the great attention we were given. Not so the 2nd time. We were a party of three. 2 of us ordered the pork the other the filet mignon. Unfortunately my pork was under-cooked. The waitress did however not charge us for the coffee but at these prices I was disappointed."}
{"text":"I started off with a Bloody Mary which was beautifully presented. I ordered the ham egg Benedict on French toast with arugula and mustarda ...it was fabulous!!! The breakfast potatoes were perfectly sautéed and the caramelized onions were a pleasant surprise. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great charcuterie platter and wines. The french fries (didn't get the but wish I had)  look like angels made them.   
I'd go back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Such a cute and funky place. Came here while on vacation. The drinks were amazing. The gnocchi and Brussels sprouts were so delicious. The entrees were plentiful and ended the evening with the churros."}
{"text":"We were here for brunch after trying to get into Cartet, which I've heard is great. Sadly they were closed for the holidays but luckily we stumbled into Hambar. The staff was very nice, the food was excellent and the setting very comfortable. My husband ordered the eggs benedict and said it was the best he's ever had. I ordered the pain perdu and it was delicious. I would highly recommend this place. We also ate at Maison Bouloud which was great - just to give you a qualifier."}
{"text":"I've visited Hambar twice in the last month or so... The maitre d'hôtel was very kind, and brought us drinks in the lobby of the hotel while finding us a table (we hadn't been able to reserve, but tried our luck). The meals I had (brunch one day, dinner the next) were excellent... The charcuterie plate is awesome... Ravioli is a little lack-lustre.

The cocktails are amazing- had the Pim's- great place in Old Mo- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So here was a pretty solid brunch joint. Breakfast tacos were fantastic. Virgin Bloody Mary came with a 10\" piece of dehydrated ham sticking out of it. So it's not really a place for veggie folk. But the wall of ham hanging at the door (and the name) probably already clued you in."}
{"text":"Perfect service. Perfect meal!

Had the meat and cheese plate-honestly the small meat plate is enormous.

Had the cavatelli and pesto which was fresh tasting and delicious.  

Wine by the glass menu was solid and provided the opportunity to try a few different ones.  Forget the name of the Bordeaux but it was def the best!

Loungy atmosphere was great too.  We will be back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"The interior of the newly opened Hambar at the Hotel St. Paul is light, modern, clean, and airy. It's very inviting in a Euro wannabe kind of way (I mean that almost positively). It reminds me of restaurants near the Naschmarkt in Vienna. Hambar is supposedly about, Jamon. There are all kinds of cured ham on the menu, and the fact they have Bellota (the amazing Spanish Iberico ham made from pata negra pigs that live a very good life on acorns which gives the meat an incredible sweet nutty taste) is reason enough to try it. However, the service is pretty shoddy, and the food is, well, meh. I had a lobster roll (I know, but hell, it's on the menu, it should be good) which was not bad, but rather bland and the accompanying salad was a sad combo of frisee, arugula, and celery, and the dressing was just unpleasant and oily, without any flavor. The Hambar lemonade cocktail was completely imablanced and overly sour, and in fact they unartfully threw in four limes and two lemons for good measure (purses lips like the old cartoons where someone eats alum). I sent mine back and opted for a glass of Pouilly Fume which went nicely with the lobster roll. My colleague had the porchetta sandwich with manchego, and a cloyingly sweet candied quince topping that detracted from the nicely done porchetta. I'll return because there were a few interesting things on the menu that I can't readily get elsewhere in Montreal including the Jamon Iberico, but they've got some work to do to bring this place up to its potential."}
{"text":"I had the most incredible charcuterie board here while visiting Montreal this past week. The entire menu looked delicious but because of how filling the charcuterie board was, I only ordered and appetizer afterwards (the gnocchi) which was also delicious! The vibe of the place is really good and we had excellent, attentive service. I will definitely return next time I'm in the city to check out more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Sitting here at the bar for 10 minutes. The bartender never asked me for my order. When my boyfriend joined me she instantly asked him for his order. She never acknowledged my presence. He asked me what I wanted and gave her the order. This was the tone for the evening cocktail. We had a quick drink and left. Cute bar but bad service and hospitality is unheard of."}
{"text":"A tad expensive but what can you expect from the restaurant inside the St Paul hotel. Nice hotel deserves a nice restaurant. I've eaten here many times and their brunch is really delicious. Try the steak and eggs! Rich and flavorful."}
{"text":"Come for: brunch on New Year's Day when nothing else is open 

Food: had the papperdelle- duck confit was great, noodles were decent, salmon plate was also tasty looking and my friend ordered. We didn't get the charcuterie so can't comment there but seems like everyone else here loves it. The mimosas were also great

Service: very nice, attentive team. Knocked on stars because we were told the burger had prosciutto on it but it didn't 

Ambience: classy joint in a hotel"}
{"text":"This place is located in the St.Paul hotel. The first thing you notice whether coming in from outside or inside are the plethora of hanging legs of ham. I loved that rustic look. Since I stayed at this hotel I decided to try the \"Hambar\" I ordered a small charcuterie platter. It had a really good assortment of pâtés like head cheese, beef tongue, pate du fois(duck liver); salumi, prosciutto or iberico ham( the ones that are hanging), cheese & sweet jelly to spread. I might have left something out- anyway this was all delicious. The service of the bartender was very friendly & helpful - she also gave info where to shop & sightsee (tourist stuff). We sat at the bar. What was really nice I was walking around Montreal in the afternoon & she recognized me & waived & had a small chat. Guess I have an unforgettable face ( stroke my ego). Back to the Hambar; I also tried the pasta pappardelle with duck - amazing!  Overall I was pleased with my visit here. They also have a terrasse (outdoor patio)."}
{"text":"One of our favorites in Montreal! Oysters are delicious to start, we get them every time. Braised short ribs and Brussels sprouts were perfect for main course. Atmosphere is on point."}
{"text":"I don't even feel like writing a lengthy review for this place. It showed a lot of promise when we walked in but proved to be a pretty lame experience. The charcuterie plate was mediocre at best, especially for a place that apparently prides itself for its meats. For our main course we shared the pappardelle \"carbonara\", which literally arrived an hour and 3 minutes after we finished the charcuteria plate. The concept of the dish sounded good but by the time we received it, it was cold. What bothered us the most was the service, they were not attentive and we had to go out of our way to get their attention. It took another 20 minutes before we got the waitresses attention for the check and we ended up leaving very unsatisfied. Save your money and go elsewhere, especially with all of the wonderful options Montreal offers. In fact, go to Restaurant Helena across the street, it's spectacular!"}
{"text":"Great charcuterie plate!  House-made mortadella and prosciutto croquets are incredible! 

This place has a trendy vibe--and at first it was a bit intimidating--but the staff is really nice and not snobby at all.  We ended up visiting several times for drinks at the bar.

Great cocktails (the Yuzu was my favorite) and a great selection of wines by the glass make this a great place to visit for dinner or just for drinks.

If you are in the old Montreal area, stop by, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend for a late brunch on a Saturday. I would describe the place as a classy modern European style type. We had ordered the small charcuterie platter to share as an appetizer and had ordered a dish each as a main meal without knowing how much was on that \"small\" platter! And the unlimited amount of bread/crispy slices of baguette! Let me tell you we were extremely stuffed when we left the place. And I tend to eat a lot! Everything on the platter tasted amazing! Just thinking about it makes me wanna go back NOW! The main meal I had was the one with two slices of french toast style bread with two egg benedicts with some mushrooms and spinach. It was delicious! I would definitely go back again, but I'll stick with just getting the platter to not over kill my stomach =P"}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 15 for my younger brother's bachelor weekend. It was the perfect spot for a bunch of guys in their 20s to feast family-style. I arranged a set menu with Sarah ahead of time through their website. She was very prompt, helpful, and friendly. 

Drink service was painfully slow, but it looked like they could have used another bartender. I bartend and also realize that a party of 15 in a smaller restaurant can really sink the bartender when ordering craft cocktails. 

The food was SUPERB. Seafood platters were absolute perfection and one of my and my brother's favorites. Charcuterie boards were heavenly, gnocchi with prosciutto and mushrooms was insanely tasty, and we got family-style steak and ham. Oh. My. God. Like...seriously. I worked in a steakhouse in Boston and thought I knew meat and presentation. These were really incredible plates for us to share that were cooked absolutely perfectly. 

Only criticisms were wait times between courses and drinks, but if you go in expecting this, enjoy your company and take your time. It will be well worth the wait. 

I was the hero of the night for that dinner, and sure I researched a lot and had input to the menu, but Sarah knew exactly how much food we needed, and the execution of the kitchen was stellar"}
{"text":"I had a great time at Hambar last night.  The atmosphere is great, (look at all the hams hanging in the front glass), staff was good and food was great.

We ordered the mid size charcuterie platter to start, it was $46 but plenty for 4 guys!  It was fantastic, see the photo's.

They have an extensive wine list, at all price levels.  We requested a specific one that was not on the menu and our server went to check.  She brought back something similar and said you can try it, if you don't like it I will bring you something else and sell this one by the glass...I know most nice restaurants will do this but the offer was very nice, obviously trying to please us with the wine.

I ate the duck magret for dinner and it was great.

To be honest, aside from the platter to start, I was a little surprised about the lack of pork on the menu.  I would've thought a place with Ham in the name and all the Pork hanging in the front window that you'd have a little more selection, and some obscure stuff.  Very good food none the less.

And the best part was, if conversation slows down and you're bored, you just go to the window and look at all the pork hanging...it's pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Excellent dishes, very attentive service, upscale bar.  They play mostly 80's adult contemporary, very classy.

The food is excellent, the duck confit pappardelle is amazing anytime of the day.

Their wine selection is excellent as well, although a bit pricy.  However the staff takes great pride serving and is very knowledgeable.

Wish it were more crowded, it's lonely because it's not very noticeable unless you read foodie reviews or stay in the hotel."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place doesn't have better reviews or a higher star rating!

Food: DELICIOUS! Gnocchi to start was very tasty. Pesto pasta was wonderful and my husband liked his short rib a lot. Dessert tasted great and was presented beautifully. 

Drinks: strong!

Atmosphere: trendy, cool. You could dress casual but some were dressy. 

Great location too!

One detriment is that the wait staff was almost too quick and took our plates/drinks when we weren't done yet."}
{"text":"I have to admit I didn't see it at first. It was pointed out to me as I made my first stroll around downtown \"Old town\" Quebec.  But when it was pointed out, I said, \"I think I've found my home here.\"  I wasn't wrong. The relatively new (June 2012) Hambar is in a space adjoining the St. Paul Hotel. The lure? A gorgeous piece of art that's also at the center of the restaurant's reason for being: A beautiful window case display of prosciutti, serrano hams and other charcuterie. This, I though, was reason to go on in for a recon mission. 

The hostess was very friendly and spoke English and French (as do most Quebecois) and had none of the too-often maligned \"French-ness\" that puts off those who don't speak it. We explained that we had just finished lunch, but she was more than willing to talk about their menu, wines and best times to come. As it turned out, we'd return only six hours later to do a full frontal assault on it.  

Hambar has a cocktail like lighting and feel, and the groups inside ranged from mid-20s through seniors. Everyone felt comfy, though, and again the waitress was quick to spend time to explain the daily specials, and then pointed out which wines they had by the glass in addition to those in their voluminous full-bottle wine list. 

When she returned with cocktails, she asked if we had questions, which we did. Her advice? We had too much on our minds and that their portions were pretty generous. If we wanted more it wouldn't be a problem. Now when's the last time that happened to you? Me, neither. Never!  Her recommendation was the small platter, which was more than generous. We also tried the prosciutto croquettes (bits of ham in cheese, then panko breaded and friend.... awesome). The platter had both prosciutto, serrano ham, black serrano, and a variety of other charcuterie.  

Every bite was a a treat. Each new item was a delicious surprise. Each minute in the place conveyed happiness and a great exploration. My first thought was wondering how someone in Chicago could open a place like this and keep it close enough to where I lived that I'd be able to go at least once a week. 

I've been very stingy in giving five stars to any restaurant, but if I'm ever going to give one, this place rates it.  While I have a whole lot of new places and cities I want to visit for food, this place would be enough to get me to return to Montreal. There's more in this great food city, but I'd do both dinner and breakfast at Hambar."}
{"text":"Excellent food I recommend this restaurant for the quality of the food and the creativity of the chef. The Panacotta was really good and the churros."}
{"text":"A group of us decided to visit this spot after a mixup of our reservation at another restaurant nearby. Located in Old Montreal, this spot is modern and sleek, and is known for its charcuterie which also hangs from the windows. The restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived, and seeing that the Mtl a table event was happening, I was surprised. We ordered the charcuterie board, their octopus and pasta plates to share. Overall the food was okay; the charcuterie board with the delicious delis, pates and condiments was definitely worth the trip. The pappardelle was nicely prepared as was the cavatelli but the octopus was chewy and bland. Although we also ordered desserts, I could have done without. They do have a great wine selection too. Overall, the experience was okay but not a go to spot for me."}
{"text":"Held a private dinner upstairs. The food was meh and the service was subpar (for the price) - there was at least a 10 minute lag before everybody had their food at each table. Fine if once, but quite bad if it is on every dish on four tables."}
{"text":"Food is ok. I'm not terribly impressed with the menu. I also don't appreciate not being told what the specials are...both times I came.  The pesto dish was good. The charcuterie plate is plentiful (even the small one).  This place was just ok to me when I was expecting so much more because it looks so cool from the outside."}
{"text":"We were a large group of over 20 and the waitress managed to give us great service. The other staff were very friendly too. The place has a nice atmosphere with classy decor and lighting.

As for the food, I ordered the beef sirloin. It tasted pretty good but portions were a bit on the small side as they often are in these types of upscale restaurant. 

Overall satisfying experience."}
{"text":"I've been there a couple times for lunch. Besides the fact that the beef tartar is quite heavy on the mayo, their food is great! The set up is cute and bright, the prices are reasonable for good quality! I've never been there for dinner but would definitely recommend you try it for a quick yet tasty business lunch."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch a few years ago with some friends  and I remember not being very impressed. I remember that I felt bad because I had organized the brunch and everyone was disappointed. Tonight I went for dinner with two friends to celebrate a birthday. I figured why not give it another shot and the birthday boy was the one who picked the restaurant so what birthday boy wants birthday boy gets! So we started with the charcuterie platter and it was delicious! My favorite was the chicken paté! I never had that before. If you like foie gras you will love it! The prosciutto was thicker than I am used to but it was good ... it wasn't too salty. In fact all their charcuterie was good. I definitely recommend it. My least favorite was the one with the dried cranberries. We got the biggest size so there was two of everything. Next time I think I would just share the smaller plate. Next we shared the pappardelle with duck confit. That was the best main of the night. We also shared the porchetta which came with lentils and apples. The porchetta was very salty and the lentils were sweet. Lastly we shared the lobster risotto. It was OK ... not too impressive. There were two lobster claws in the risotto ....without the shell of course, which isn't bad. 

Putting the food aside, we were horrified that there was no soap in both the men and women's washrooms!! Eww! The washrooms are outside of the restaurant and apparently the waiters informed the hotel concierge to replenish the soap but they did not. Also someone was smoking in their hotel room which caused the fire alarm to go off. It sounded like a bird was dying! The waiter informed us that by law they are not allowed to turn it off and that they had to wait for the firemen to come and turn it off! Needless to say we got the hell out of there as fast as we could."}
{"text":"Got invited by a friend after work.

She told me it's a good place around our work. 

I liked the plat. We ordered one for share also tacos as entrée.

They have place inside and outside. Very good when it's sunny."}
{"text":"J'y suis allé pour un brunch. Je m'attendais à trouver plus de charcuterie dans mon assiette. Mais elle était tout de même succulente. Je recommandé vivement."}
{"text":"I went there for brunch. The one I had was poaches egg, duck, pain dorée and deep fried potatoes. It tasted good. The service was nice too."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! It's the perfect spot to get a charcuterie plate! The meats and cheeses are heavenly! 

The food is also just really really good! They know how to handle meat."}
{"text":"The presentation is great but there is no substance. The charcuteries are underwhelming. 
Let's put it like this: if you are someone who enjoys quality charcuterie at home, you will hate this place. If you are someone who never shops for charcuterie, then  you might actually enjoy it.

The prosciutto was ordinary. I was surprised that a place called hambar does not serve pata negra!?!

Their homemade patés are lacking in flavour. The homemade mortadella is terrible. No one at our table was able to eat their piece. The porchetta was tasty. 

The main dishes are ok, but again very one dimensional. They look great and the description on the menu sounds nice, but the execution is lacking.

My main problems were the quality of the cold cuts and their food is just not flavourful. 

The service was efficient, attentive and friendly. The coffee was good."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late afternoon snack on the recommendation of a friend. The bar was fairly empty so the service was stellar. We shared a small (?) chartcuterie board (it was plenty for two people!) We really enjoyed it. We also shared a bottle of wine. Great way to relax after a lot of walking in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Having read over others' reviews, I wonder what I have to add to the conversation. It seems like some were dissatisfied with the service, but I've been to Hambar several times and have always been well looked after. I do tend to sit at the bar, so that may have affected my experience.

The food is inventive, gorgeously presented, and delicious. They pickle their own vegetables here and use them throughout the ever-changing menu to brighten up the dishes. 

The by-the-glass wine list is extensive. The desserts are worth saving room for.

Whether it's for a glass of wine and charcuterie plate, a full meal, or a late night snack, I think Hambar hits the nail on the head."}
{"text":"Overrated.  Overpriced. Overcrowded despite half the restaurant being empty (they crowd you in one area to make the place appear full).  Part of a hotel although most customers were locals. Food deserves 3 stars but atmosphere lacked comfort and elegance."}
{"text":"Food, wine and service were amazing! Everything from the charcuterie and cheese to the veal ribs and grilled octopus were impeccable! It was crowded and we sat at a communal table, but our neighbors were very friendly and just added to the experience. Wonderful experience all around, and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very nice looking place with a large assortment of wines, and a charcuterie plate that is a must try.  

I brought an italian friend here and the prosciutto was of great quality by his standards"}
{"text":"Faut admettre que la spécialité de charcuterie est intrigante. Le plateau pour 4 était très bien, varié, bonnes quantités, goûteux, original. Un succès. Les autres plats, raviolis et gnocchis, étaient très bien aussi (mais le plat de gnocchis trop petit).

La carte des vins est intéressante mais aucun de mes 3 choix étaient en stock... on m'a offert un Cahors alors que j'avais opté pour 2 CDR, un Rioja... mais heureusement il était très bien.

Le service est sympa, du moins en terrasse mais le staff ne connaît pas très bien la carte et est un peu trop amateur pour un resto positionné ainsi.

Peut-être un brin trop cher... mais bon, le type de faune dans la salle ne semble pas avoir un problème avec ça."}
{"text":"Great food!  I didn't know what to expect so we ordered the French toast and the montecristo sandwich.  The French toast was delicious!! Such great delicate flavour.  The sandwich was a hit as well.  It wasn't crowded but we were there in the dead of winter storm.  Great service and the staff event helped up Shazam a track."}
{"text":"They are pretty good with the water refills. 
This is the old Vauvert. 
Drink portions are small except for wine so get that. 
The appetizer, cod croquet, is probably the best option. But fried.
I got the contrefilet beouf. It was really delicious but very small. 
My hubby got the veal (entrecôte veau). It was good, not great, but very small. 
A friend ordered a drink and it came with a piece of ham in it so beware if you don't eat ham. 
Service is good. 
It's nice atmosphere as a bar. But not my favorite restaurant. 
I'd come back only for a drink in a quiet but nice atmosphere. Good for talking. But not good for people watching cuz there aren't that many people."}
