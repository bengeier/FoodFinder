{"text":"I wished I had read the reviews before I committed to this airport restaurant. The reviews below are accurate; unfriendly staff. The waitress literally threw a menu at me, I wasn't paying attention and it fell on the floor. We had a standoff, staring at the menu, challenging who would pick it up.  Impossible to get the staff attention. Out of 17 chairs, 3 were occupied, so the staff of 3 certainly wasn't too busy to attend to their few customers."}
{"text":"chince on the tip... you'll pay for it when you drink.  Also, it is in Chicago.  I got a Chicago dog.  Very overcooked.  How do you overcook a hotdog?  The dog was also tiny so it seemed like all roll and relish.  I think it was 40 bucks for a hotdog and 3 drinks.  Ridiculous.  Well, I'm the idiot who stopped here."}
{"text":"Great chili ! But I left my iPad at the bar I have left hundreds of messages with every department and I never got a call back!"}
{"text":"This place sucks!  One of the bartenders was practically sleepong at the register and the other goluy avoided euee contact.   Our table was dirty and i asked for the plastic cups to be disposed of, after several minutes the sleepy guy came around and took the garbage but did not clean the table.  We asked to place andorder after waiting for 15 minutes to be waited on, and the guy had us yell it to him over other guest sitting at the bar. Unprofessional!   The food was cold.  We saw it sitting up there for over 5 minutes and my husbad walked up and asked for it. It was cold and nasty.  We disn\"t even eat half of it."}
{"text":"Passing through O'Hare I had a fantasy of tasting one of my weaknesses, a Chicago dog. Fantasy fulfilled! The large dog was grilled and charred.  The poppy seed bun and the neon green relish was right. The tomato tasted home grown and the other condiments were right.  The fries were puffy inside and had a crisp crust. Airport prices, 20 bucks for a dog, fries, and Stella draft, but it was the real deal."}
{"text":"I come here because I work in the airport and the food is decent but the fries are probably the best in all of T3. The energy is terrible tho. Nobody smiles. EVERY time I come there's always tension between the cook and the European lady at the register who never asks what you want to eat, she just stares at you until you speak to her first. I don't think anyone really likes to work here. There used to be a really nice gentlemen who was always friendly. Not sure what happened to him. This is a super weird environment but good food. I guess this is the place to eat if you want to wait for 10-15 minutes in an awkward silence while everyone stares at each other.   Not sure who's doing the hiring, but I'd definitely be tipping more if I got better service. Also the 2 stars are basically just my love of their fries. If it was service alone it'd be 1star :/"}
{"text":"This review is for the Chicago Style Hot Dog:  \"The path of discovery-\"Honey, I'm home!\"  FYI-  Frank Lloyd Wright-the famous Chicago Architect who mastered the \"Prairie Style\" architectural concept in the homes here in the Chicago area is featured here in the restaurant.  Six Word Review Hemingway Short Story Style for all of my hot dog reviews....see my hot dog  list!  PS.  Great wine selection (Malbec!) and fast and efficient waitstaff!"}
{"text":"We ordered Classic burger and Chicago dog.  Food quality is mediocre, nothing stands out.  HMS Host manager contacted me and apologized.  She said the will send me a certificate or card to make it up.  Nothing really happened afterwards.  Therefore the apology was not really sincere.  I will change the rating of this place to zero star if it allows me."}
{"text":"Steak Sandwich. Something like $5000 per sandwich.  ($11.99 or something, fine.) Drizzle in Tabasco, splash on Worcestershire sauce. Juiciest sandwich you'll ever have.  Wings. Dip wing into their hot sauce and blow your mind to pieces.  Whatever jetlag you had -  -  - poof, gone!!!!!!!!!!!!    Momentarily, anyhow."}
{"text":"Buffalo wings and hummus plate with pita, good to go lunch. I asked for ranch swapped versus Bleu cheese(ew) and that didn't happen, but other than that adequate. Messy, but good...."}
{"text":"Very small bar, maybe 20 seats total.  Fills up because H and K gates have few other options for getting a drink.  Service was ok, wings and beer were ok, just normal bar food.  Nothing more, nothing less."}
{"text":"I was here between flights and when I arrived the dude kept looking at me vs coming to the table. When he finally came I ordered a cowboy burger. Seemed simple enough to me. Turns out it's hard for them. Came out raw.  Absolutely terrible!!"}
{"text":"The service was pleasent, the food was decent, but none of that matters when your server is sick and coughing into her hands, and all around the dishes she is serving you. I was grossed out.   Also, 1Bud Light draft is $10.82. What's up with that!"}
{"text":"When observing this restaurant stall at the airport, I didn't see B*TCH on the menu, however that's exactly what We got when We ordered our meals to go.   While I have no idea what the woman's name was who took me and my fianc√©'s dinner orders, you better believe that if I did, I would have let it be known and her boss (if he/she read this Yelp review) would fire her. I really cannot get over HOW INCREDIBLY RUDE and JUDGMENTAL she was! It's as if SHE were the one who just got off a 20 hour flight, sitting next to crying 2-year old twins, that also had horrific turbulence... But no, she had simply just been working her JOB that she APPLIED FOR... And shockingly got hired to do.  Any who... Let me make a note about the food...   - The Steak Sandwich: I got a \"yum-huh-umph\" when I acted how the sandwich was, so I'll take that to mean it was a good choice on his part.  - Salad with 2 sides of grilled chicken and 2 sides of grilled salmon. The chicken was top notch, seasoned to perfection... The salmon was bland and tasted like that pre frozen crap you get at like Costco or something... The salad with fine too, using romaine lettuce BUT.... I SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR NO CHESSE, and what do you know... I found globs of melted cheese underneath my protein... As if the chef started adding it to my meal and then realized it said NO CHEESE on the order but was TOO LAZY to start over. Awesome. Well thanks for trying to poison me while embarking on an 8 hour flight! So sweet of you...   Sadly, despite the amazingly tasty chicken and the steak sandwich that pleased probably the pickiest person on the face of the planet... I have to give this place ONLY 2 stars because... Ugh that #%^*%!? of a server.... Was just.... So so so rude."}
{"text":"O'Hare was one of the layovers my friend and I had on our way to Alabama. We left Hawaii on a red-eye. When we were able to FINALLY have a layover we could actually eat at, we were HUNGRY. Prairie Tap was located in the food court in the airport. I was really hungry so I was looking for a eatery that didn't have a loooong line. We were in Chicago, and I would've wanted to try some deep dish, but when we passed the pizza place, the pizzas were sitting in a heating case. Kind of bummed because that meant it wasn't fresh.  Anyway, we decided to check out the Prairie Tap. My friend and I both noticed the Mushroom & Cheese Burger. We both ordered it. I ordered mine with a salad side Ranch. My friend ordered her's with fries. The burger itself was pretty big. I liked that there was a nice amount of lettuce, and it wasn't Iceberg. I can't say the salad was that great though. It was pretty plan didn't have much of anything in it. The croutons were stale. The burger was average. I didn't finish it all."}
{"text":"I hate to say it, but I'm slightly bummed that I chose this place over McDonalds. For the $12 (I tipped, even though I wound up ordering at the bar and then going up to the bar to pick up my food...), I got a very mediocre burger and some lame seasoned fries. It's nice to sit in a better spot than the food court, but it really felt like a bad economic decision."}
{"text":"Hugo offered outstanding service tonight. As soon as I took the last sip of my drink, he was over asking if I wanted another. It was a busy Saturday night, too, and in my 2 hours or so at Prairie Tap, I don't think I observed a single person walking in who spent more than 30 seconds before Hugo had made contact. I had the Texas chili and chips along with cabernet and it hit the spot. It's rare I get service so good that I feel compelled to write a review, but tonight was one of those nights. Thank you, Hugo!"}
{"text":"The Prairie Tap is as close to a community haunt as you can get in one of the busiest airports in the world. Armed with Frank Lloyd Wright inspired decor, standing tables and a small bar, and good eats, the Prairie Tap is the best place in the ORD to wait for a delayed flight or grab some grub to eat on the plane.  The owner has a great bar-yapping personality. He can chat you up while pouring up glasses of drought beer for others. M has talked to him about running races while she waited for her mushroom burger.  We've gotten burgers and dogs here on a couple of occassions and have been pleased. Not the best burger you've ever had, but it sure beats the fast food joints in the nearby food court. The portions are generous and the food is flavorful. I'm sure that we were the envy of coach with our warm plates of food from Prairie Tap."}
{"text":"So this is airport food/service let's start there so I'd still go here (limited choices) . Not expecting a lot but had a few misses. I ordered fish/chips which come with fries, cole-slaw as well as a pickle. Mine came out with no slaw and pickle, I asked and they said no.. they were out. I was debating between two different things and leaned this way cause I had a craving for slaw so that was a bummer. He beer selection didn't match menu, the food was good but they seemed to be out of a bunch of stuff and didn't tell you they were out of it.   Food was ok and service was par for airport fast food"}
{"text":"Stopped by here to watch a football game before boarding a flight back to LA. Service was rude. Ordered some cheesesticks and a Coke and it came out to $12. Sheesh."}
{"text":"Rude, rude, rude, rude. Did I say rude? My order sat in the window for five minutes while the bartender played on his phone. When I asked the expediter/prep cook who had just made my order if the order was what I ordered she replied \"I don't know\". How in the heck do you not know what you just prepared?? It's people like this that remain the primary argument for not increasing minimum wage, they probably already make more than they are worth."}
{"text":"Poor service. Used to be my favorite place at O'Hare but they took gyros off the menu and Kent is checked out.  Had to ask for a beer and food despite making eye contact multiple times."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was horrendous. The bartender was miserable and about as rude of a server as I've come across."}
{"text":"No glassware, only plastic. We had 3 drinks (1 single whiskey, then 2 doubles each) and it came to $120. Even taking into account that doubles are like two drinks, that's 10 drinks total for $120. 10 shots of Jameson to be exact. I've never in my life paid $12 a shot for Jameson.  Besides the fact it's very overpriced it's tiny - SUPER tiny and in an airport with people carrying luggage that is a bit annoying. On top of that our bill was wrong. There was no trouble correcting it but since the whole place only seats about 14 people max I don't see how you can mix up orders. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I didn't like the beer selection, and liquor prices were super high. I had a Caesar salad with chicken and it was actually better that I expected... Or at least more food anyway. :p I probably won't return though.."}
{"text":"Making a quick stop to grab a bite before your flight?  Running through the American terminal, head to the food court and sit down at the Prairie Tap.  This place has some of the best coconut shrimp I have ever had.  For being an airport joint, that is great!  The prices are pretty standard for an airport location."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant of all time in an airport.   If this place was not in the airport I would still be here.   I used to try and plan my business travel to Chicago as I knew I would have the Rib Eye Sandwich to and from the airport.  They use some quality steak in this sandwich.  Grilled onions with juicy mushrooms.  The bread is a roll that is toasted.   They have some great Buffalo Wings as well.  Lots of meat on that bone and juicy.   Not spiced up so be sure to bathe it in some hot sauce before running for the plane.    It is a great idea to get a meal from them when you are running to the next flight.   I always feel kind of bad eating food on the plane when others are eating bland pasta....BUT hey too bad.  Back to the review.   This place is located at K4 in terminal K.   Nice if you are an AA traveler if you are not- it would be kind of a haul.   It is located very close to the Admirals club.  They have burgers, salads, nice menu of beers and wines as well."}
{"text":"It's a restaurant-bar in the airport so set your expectations accordingly. That being said, service was quick and the food was average. The beer selection was limited and not cheap.   Eat here if you need a quick bite and beer near your gate. If you've got a longer layover look for the Goose Island bar in the Airport."}
{"text":"On the way back home to Dallas on a busy Thursday night in O'Hare all me and some co-workers wanted was somewhere to sit and a cold brew: Prairie Tap was the only place with the perfect storm.  Beers were exactly what we wanted: huge and cold. Food was meh. I ordered the buffalo shrimp and expecting giant fried shrimp covered in buffalo wing sauce I was greeted with a few small fried shrimp and a couple dipping sauces on the side. Maybe the chef needs a trip to Hooters to figure out what Buffalo (insert meat here) means."}
{"text":"I have been purposely routing my change of planes through ORD for years just so I can have one of their incredible rib-eye steak sandwiches.  I travel loads. and at $12.99 it is the best deal going in any airport I know!  Oh yeah, they close at 9PM so tell your pilot to throttle-up and park at gate K4 in terminal 3 (PT is directly across).  On tap:  Bud, Bud Light, and Sam.  Seriously.  What other airport food is deserving of five stars?  Zip.  This place is an Oasis."}
{"text":"This place is a tiny, compact, busy bar with a kitchen than turns out freshly cooked classic bar food. I got the salmon sandwich with slaw and fries $13. That was may be the healthiest dish on the menu. The slaw is tasty  but tiny so I quickly finished my little plastic tub. The bar staff gave me another without me asking...mind reader! :)  The service was friendly and chatty. The seating was pretty cramped on a Thurs night but once the H & K gates close it clears out around 7.40pm."}
{"text":"Decent pub food in the H and K food court in terminal 3. There is a good selection of salads, appetizers, and sandwiches. The service was fast and the bartender was very nice. I had the buffalo wings. They came with buffalo sauce on the side which was kind of strange, but they tasted good. The Caesar salad was not bad the dressing came on the side. Overall it's a good place to stop when you have time in O'Hare."}
{"text":"This airport restaurant consists of hightop tables and bar seating. We ordered at the bar but sat at a nearby hightop table. I found it a bit strange that I had to pay before getting my food. What if I wanted to tip based on the service that I was to receive? Yeah, about that. Skipping ahead, once the food was ready, the bar tender signaled for me to pick up my meal from the bar.   I'm not a breakfast food fan, so I appreciated the fact that the entire menu was available during breakfast hours. I ordered the Blue Burger and fries. The burger was an average patty, but it was pretty good sized. The fries weren't good at all. They tried to season them up a bit, but that didn't mask the horrible taste. I never waste fries, but now I can't say never."}
{"text":"Stopped here to get a quick bite before my connection to DC.  Pros:  Delicious grilled salmon sandwich  Close to K gates.  Fair prices.  Cons:  Unfriendly, unprofessional staff. Extremely long wait time.  And they treated everyone that way. Not just me. I would only eat here again if I was desperately hungry and in a rush."}
{"text":"I mean the worst food I've had in a long time. 27 years with American airlines and they treated me like poop. food was terrible service was worse. $14 dollars never going back"}
{"text":"Ordered two drinks from a not so happy bartender. Both drinks were served in small portions, not very strong at all, and for an expensive tab. Not doing this again."}
{"text":"I was delighted to dine again at Prairie Tap between connections after so many years!  Nestled in O'Hare's K Concourse near the food court, It used to be my go-to spot back in the day.  I always had their rib-eye steak sandwich with Caesar salad and a draft beer.  Happily, the grilled rib-eye was as good as I remembered, satisfyingly meaty, hot and juicy, tender, with soft sauteed onions and mushrooms, and a dollop of A1 steak sauce on the side to occasionally dip into (I almost never use A1 but for some reason - and not because of any deficiency in the steak - it just seems to go well for this particular sandwich and setting).  The faces have changed, but the food has not, and very happy to indulge in a generous lunch like this.  Some of the other reviewers have complained about the service but I never had a problem; although I recall when the place is packed, service can be a little on the brisk side, so perhaps that was the issue.  But the food is good, the beer is cold, and sure to fortify you for that final leg of the trip."}
{"text":"Crappy service.  Waited at the bar, which was busy, but the servers were too busy speaking Spanish to one another than wait on me.  I wonder if any if them plan on showing up as Mexican protesters at the next Trump rally...?? Estupido"}
{"text":"What is with this place? Tried ordering 5 different things...out of all of them. Who substitutes breakfast potatoes for french fries? To serve with salmon?? If you don't have any food...literally...you should close."}
