{"text":"Amazing. Had the beef bourgignon, which was as good as I've had in Paris. Great service. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Inglewood area is a distinctive part of calgary and we came here looking for a suitable dining experience. We found it at Eden. Casual atmosphere, friendly service, good food. We had the mushroom toast and crab cakes as starters, then the pan fried sole and ratatouille for main course. The quantity was more than enough and the flavoring delightful.  They have a simple menu and reasonable prices so you can focus on the company you're with and the quaint creaky floors that add to the Inglewood atmosphere."}
{"text":"Menu selection (cocktail and main) is absolutely wonderful. Tried the burrata, the mussels, the frog legs, the steak tartare, the bistro salad, and a black rose cocktail, and all were fantastic. Service was great, music was not too loud, and the experience was overall wonderful. 10/10 recommend !!!"}
