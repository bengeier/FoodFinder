{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service.  I live nearby, so I eat here a lot - when I'm too tired/lazy to cook for myself and my kids.  Yolanta, the owner, is top-notch.  She is a creative cook and an excellent baker - not just homemade bread but delicious sweets such as banana bread, lemon squares, and my favourite - coconut squares.  The burgers are excellent, as are the fries (fresh cut).  I agree with Mike B - the boar burger is delicious. If you want a more healthy meal,  Yolanta's soups are amazing and she offers several different ones (usually 1 per day), so it's always a surprise.  The burritos are great - I've had the beef and the veggie.  The homemade salsa is a nice touch.  And they really are huge - I sometimes save half for my lunch at work the next day.  Sadly, I'm usually too stuffed for my favourite item on the menu - the blintzes. Homemade rasberry sauce, or apple.  To. Die. For. The only downside are the irregular hours, but it is totally family-run, mostly just one person there, so it's understandable.  They take debit and credit as well.  I hope they stick around for a long time."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch on a snowy Saturday. I had a burger and Henry had a burrito. They were both delicious and made from scratch. They even gave us some coconut tarts for later which were the best tarts!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today for a late lunch with my teen son.  I had the Cuban bean soup and my son the student cheeseburger and fries special.  My son loved the fries and burger (\"it's the best burger I've had that wasn't homemade\"), and the soup came in a huge bowl and was very flavourable, especially once I added the salsa that was included (tasted like a strong chimichurri).  The owner was very nice and even added a small serving of fries to my dish to try along with a coconut tart/muffin for desert.  This place has a ton of choices from crepes and burritos to exotic burgers (camel, anyone?) and soups.  Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Had the very fortunate opportunity to have a catered dinner from this fantastic restaurant at J&C Bistro - The Bistro on Jane at a friends house this past Saturday....OMG! Everything was to die for! I'm a HUGE #foodie and I know how to make great food too, but this lady's food was amazing!  My friend who is a food developer for a major grocery store, hint...(MAJOR Family company that makes President products), was blown away with this place too! Lemon Bars, coconut cakes, and the lasagna was the bomb! Organic meat sauce, fresh homemade lasagna noodles, proper bechamel sauce,  and oodles of cheese...made for a great  lasagna take out!  Apparently, she had another shop outside of the city too, and moved to Toronto.  Her brunch is amazing too according to my friends!  Great prices, and I heard that the french toast is made with homemade brioche bread, and there's amazing crepes....sign me up! Looking forward to going to the restaurant if their take out was this good!"}
{"text":"Bistro on Jane has great potential.    I had a burger and fries with a salad, and really enjoyed it (the burger was a homemade patty, homemade bun, and super fresh salad).  The owners are very nice, took time to get to talk to us, and introduce themselves.  They also mentioned that they make their own bread, soups, and other goodies.    The hours at the moment aren't great (open at 11, close at 6 on weekdays, and closed on Sunday), so that pretty much rules out dinner visits for me, as they're closed by the time I get home from work.  However, the owners mentioned that they're still trying to figure out their client√®le and the best hours for the area.  They did just add a student's menu for the high school across the street.  I really enjoyed my meal and the atmosphere when I went the first time - looking forward to trying it again soon when they've had some time to settle into the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Well, it's time to review again.  This place is really hitting its stride.  It opened back in November, and I had been a few times - but they've since updated their menu.  They have a burrito that is phenomenal.  It's huge - it comes with homemade salsa - it's one tasty treat.  But here's what pushes it over the edge for me:  The boar burger.  Don't ask for such and such on it.  Just let them make it how they make it.  There are mushrooms in truffle oil, and beautiful cheese on top of a patty like none you've ever tasted - all on a bun made completely in house.  The bread alone puts this a step above the rest.  And just as before, the husband and wife team that runs this place are top notch.  There are few places I'd rather eat - and eat - and eat - than here."}
