{"text":"Great atmosphere and delicious food! Raw bar is best in the city! Also, I love the beef tartare with the potato chips !!!"}
{"text":"My third time here and clearly I like it. Bar staff is on point with nicely hand crafted cocktails. Food is \"big city\" competitive. The atmosphere is cool/hip/chic with glass all around looking over the streets. Music is solid with a slightly funky playlist. Y'all come and say hey to Kyle and Taylor at the bar"}
{"text":"Went to Union Standard on Friday night. Overall it was an underwhelming experience all around.  Remodel was impressive, nice space, and the atmosphere in other parts of the dining room looked nice. However we were sat by the door under some bright lights, which at 10pm was off-putting.  Wine was unremarkable, cocktail (Union Mule) was fine.  Oysters were great, super fresh, Would go back just for these.   Ribeye was good. Cooked nicely, but the burnt brassica on top wasn't a great side. For $42, wasn't worth it.  Trout was bland, full of bones, and sitting in a bland potato soup. I had a few bites but after I got a few bones, and started looking at how many more bones remained, I was done with that dish. I left most of this soggy meal in the bowl, and waiter did not inquire how it was, or if I wanted it wrapped up.   Manager was horsing around with acquaintances and hostess, did not inquire how any tables were doing, but did ask us how it was when we were getting our coats to leave. When I said that it wasn't great and why...he stood there motionless, and sheepishly said he hoped it was better next time. Maybe it will be better in a few months, but at $150 with tip, I'm not going to go back anytime soon.   We live downtown and it's great that restaurants continue to open, but I will be excited when this trend of overly complicated, and (in this case) poorly executed food is over. Even if you have a great space, cool menus and uniforms, if you're not meat and potatoes / butcher and the rye, don't pretend to be."}
{"text":"Potato bread appetizer was delicious!  I had the cauliflower schnitzel meal which was very good.  Nice ominous, clean and Rey enjoyed the music selection"}
{"text":"Bar Review Only  I stopped in for a drink with some friends. When we walked in I was immediately hit with the smell of slightly off fish. I love eating seafood and cooking it and know that it shouldn't smell like that. Since we just came for drinks, I wasn't worried.   The bar is in a big open space and has a modern hotel bar feel to it. We got a seat in the bar area and the upbeat, friendly server came over and greeted us. We asked a couple of questions about the drink menu and made our selections.  I like dark beer and there were two on the menu that were local, so I was happy. Then the server came back and said they just ran out of my chosen beer. I chose the other dark beer they had and the server came back again and said that beer had just run out too and they were replacing it with a wheat beer. Strike two! The only dark beer they had left was in bottles. This process took about 20 minutes and by this point some of my friends were part of the way through their drink.   The server offered an amber beer to try and I liked that, so I ordered it. A different server brought a beer to our table, but it was the wrong one. The beer they brought was a wheat beer, that looked like orange juice. Strike three! After about 40 minutes I still didn't have a beer. At this point, my friends were almost done with their drinks and I just wanted to leave. One of the managers came up to our table, said they were sorry and took one of my friends drinks off the tab. I was really looking forward to liking this place, but things just didn't go well."}
{"text":"Some tough reviews so far.  I went to the bar last night for a drink and some snacks.  There is a good selection of wine by the glass; I had two glasses of the Austerity cab - very nice.  We also had the crab dip  and the clams.  The crab dip is delicious - buttery, creamy and full of big chunks of crab - and we finished every morsel; but the star of the show is the clams.  The broth made with Arsenal cider is rich, just the right amount of seasoning, enhanced with bacon and leeks, mustard, lemon...crispy croutons that soak up the broth and perfectly steamed clams.   I've been for dinner as well as couple of weeks ago - all good - the service has been great at the bar and at a table.  My new favorite - great food and a nice atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"We really like Union Standard.  It's not cheap, and so the expectations are higher, but they have delivered the several times we've been there.  First, this is a place that knows how to prepare an oyster.  They are always shucked properly (not beat up like you can get at places in Pittsburgh), and they have different varieties, which we always like.  They serve their mignonette with an eye dropper, so you can add just a drop or two, and have the taste compliment the oyster rather than overpower it.   The rest of the menu is good and inventive.    Funny, but with everything on the menu, let me recommend their burger.  I think it's one of the best burgers in Pittsburgh.  Now I don't want to start a fight on this one.  I love Tessaros burgers, and Burgatory is a favorite place to make your own custom burger, but the burger at Union Standard is one of my favorite right-off the menu burgers.  It's simple, not overly topped with this and that, and so it relies on the burger itself being well seasoned, which it is.  And then there's the Marrownaise.  Can you guess what that is?  Yes, it's what you think it is, and it's excellent!  We've had the crisp smelts, and they're great, and the crispy squash blossoms with ramps chimichurri, also great.    Good selection of beers, good service, nice atmosphere.  All together it's one of our favorites."}
{"text":"I came for lunch on a weekday.  It's a beautiful looking space and the bartender was very nice.  I got the spicy bluefish sandwich with fries.  I made the mistake of assuming that the fries came with the sandwich, that's on me for not asking.  The sandwich was good, but did not have a lot of taste to it.  I'm a fan of Eleven's swordfish sandwich so I was a little bit disappointed.  Also, I feel that the lunch was not worth the price.  Over $20 with tip for a fairly modest sized sandwich and a handful of fries.  I don't think I will return for lunch unless someone else is paying, but will bring my wife down for dinner someday on a special occasion."}
{"text":"This review is a little overdue, but with the holidays, I got distracted.  My husband and I came here for dinner on a Friday night in early November for my birthday.  The food was absolutely incredible- one of the best meals I have had in a long while.  We started with the potato bread (a must have!).  It comes with three different butter spreads to put on it.   I wish our waiter pointed out which butter was which, but it was not anything we couldn't figure out by tasting it.  My husband and I contemplated ordering a second \"loaf\" of the bread, but held back in order to save room at the end of the meal for dessert.  My husband also ordered the steak tartare.  Although I didn't personally try it, my husband said that it was the best tartare he's ever had.    For an entree, my husband ordered the sea scallops and I ordered the strip steak.  The steak was amazing - a perfect medium rare!  I thought the dish was large enough to share.  My husband had some of the steak and I still had enough left over to make a sandwich the next day.  The chimichurri and mashed fingerling potatoes complimented the steak well.   My husband's scallops were also cooked perfectly.  I wish we had left over some of the potato bread to soak up the broth that came with the scallop dish.    For dessert we ordered the vanilla dutch baby, which came recommended by our waiter.  Dessert was good, but definitely the weakest part of the meal.  I wish the apples were cooked down, instead of being raw.  I think it would have added an additional depth of flavor and warmth to the dish.    There are a lot of elements of Union that are similar to Eleven (which makes sense because the chef/owner is the former chef of Eleven).  All leftovers are packaged and left at the coat check for when you leave.  It's a nice touch that helps avoid leaving leftovers on the table.  Te overall decor is modern, but the fabrics and colors used in the space made it feel warm and comfortable.  Our bill came to about $130, which included 3 drinks, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and dessert.  It was a lot lower than I expected, but still high enough to save this place for a more special occasion.  I will definitely be back again, but plan to try out their happy hour soon.  The happy hour is half off oysters and burgers, and based on how well the meals were executed at our dinner, I'm sure the happy hour will surpass my expectations."}
{"text":"Just ok...the space is beautiful, but very loud, acoustics force you to yell to your table.  The food was pretty good but not great, not great value with respect to the pricing.  The service was friendly but slow, we waited a longggg time for our entrees, and it was a Thursday night, it wasn't full.  Overall I'd say it's worth a visit, but I wouldn't hurry."}
{"text":"Definitely give this place a try. We went here for my birthday and absolutely loved it. We showed up early and had a drink at the bar before our reservation. Both cocktail were very well crafted and balanced. We ordered half a dozen oyster with our drink and were very happy with them. The bartender recommended the katama oysters and I second this recommendation. They were fresh and paired well with our cocktails. For dinner, we started with the beef tartare which was amazing. We then ordered the salmon and scallop dishes. Both were outstanding. The service was very prompt and friendly and provided recommendations for wine pairings with our entrees. Would absolutely go here again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Brunch today with my mother and a friend.   We all enjoyed the ambiance and service.   The menu offered a broad range of choices.  Our meals were beautifully presented and flavorful.  Big shout out for the potato bread and goat butter.  I plan on visiting again this week during happy hour!"}
{"text":"Located in what will soon be the Distrikt Hotel, the Union Standard is in a beautiful space on William Penn Place in downtown Pittsburgh. The drink list is quite varied and the Martinez I ordered was spot on. The menu is small with a focus on seafood. I was disappointed that they did not offer the raw bar menu to us even though we were seated at a table in the restaurant. We ordered the crab dip to start and it was probably my favorite dish of the night. The roasted potato and goat cheese soup was delicious with just the right amount of goat cheese. I ended up ordering clams steamed in cider and while they had a great flavor, they were just way too salty. My boyfriend ordered the burger requesting medium rare, however it was cooked well done. It's probably best to stick with the seafood options. The staff are all very accommodating and friendly which is a huge plus!  Not sure that I will be back but I am glad that I was able to try a new place in downtown. Overall, I think Union Standard will do well for the downtown crowd."}
{"text":"The menu is extremely limited and pretty pricy once all is considered. The reality is I had a lamb stew and it was small for the outrageous price I paid. It was damn good though."}
{"text":"The drinks are delicious. They were great for the price and expertly constructed. The food and service left a lot to be desired. We waited a log time to be served and to get out check and later to pay the check."}
{"text":"I was very happy with this new downtown bar/restaurant. The drinks were good for fairly standard downtown happy hour prices. And the small bar food items were delicious and only $6. Even something as simply as the fries were amazing. I have every intention of going back."}
{"text":"Delicious! Especially liked the quinoa salad that came with my salmon. Husband really liked his rigatoni."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Service was slow. Our waitress was inattentive. For the cost, the service should have been better. Atmosphere sort of odd -- has a hotel feel. There are better places to eat downtown."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Downtown Pgh eating scene! Thoughtfully prepared dishes that are unique and tasty. Although the menu seems small, everything on it is delicious. Try the crab dip!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar both times I've been here, and both the bar staff and other patrons have been very friendly. That atmosphere goes well with a great craft cocktail! Food has been very good too. The tomato salad they had over the summer was one of the best I've had, both in flavor and visual composition."}
{"text":"Went for brunch before a show at the Benedum.  We had extra time and our server was gracious about our Staying at the table for so long.  Starter breads were yummy.  Two of us had the scramble, one the omelet and one had the French toast.  Scramble didn't have much meat but still was good.  The restaurant space was really lovely.  Would love to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Just got a 5oz pour for $9 glass of house wine. Really?!? I asked for a bigger, but was told that this was a standard. Bottom line is \"take it or leave\" because this one is on the house!! Wow!! I'll be willing to pay $10 for a standard 7oz pour. Not happy about it!!"}
{"text":"I have recently returned to Union Standard for lunch with my family. Previously, I only went to happy hour, where the drink options did not color me entirely impressed. This time around, as I sat down for lunch with my family, I ordered the baked pesto rigatoni, while my family ordered options such as the halibut and burger. The service was good, albeit not as attentive as I expected as the water was not filled very often.   When my meal arrived, it was quite beautiful. The pasta was a beautiful kelly green color and a side salad made my plate burst with hues of green. The flavor, however, did not live up to its appearance. The sauce was oily and did not stick to the rigatoni. I suggest a noodle like angel hair or fusilli that can hold onto the sauce better than the large rigatoni. The vegetable mix inside the pesto bake was interesting as well. It featured potatoes, which I would not think to put in pasta, but it soaked up the pesto nicely. The ramps and cheese melted on top were my favorite parts of it, since the ramps wilted in the sauce, giving it a creamed spinach feel. The side salad was also delicious and featured a light dressing that did not mask the crunch or flavor of the greens.   My family seemed much more impressed by their meals. I have a feeling that this restaurant is better known for their meat options. Nonetheless, impressive menu and good service. A nice place to go for lunch with coworkers during the week."}
{"text":"Went for lunch this past weekend. Ordered a salmon salad thinking it would be a bed of lettuce with a piece of salmon on top. It was just a piece of salmon over quoina, peas, and chopped cucumbers. Although it was very tasty, I wish it was properly labeled. This salad was very pricey for what you got. I don't know too many people that will pay $19 for a salad on their lunch break. Atmosphere was superb!"}
{"text":"It is worth checking out this new downtown establishment.  I had heard they had great food but the service was less than desirable.  We went for brunch this past Sunday and it was not the least bit crowded.  The service was on the slower side but overall it was fine for our group of 6. The brunch menu was pretty limited with mostly lunch foods and appetizers. I went with the melted leek and goat cheese omelet which came with fingerling potatoes and a citrus salad.  It was all very tasty and a hearty portion. The citrus salad was especially good with orange and grapefruit slices topped with basil.  Everyone else in our party was pleased with their orders including the oatmeal bowl and the salmon dish. The prices were pretty reasonable and it was a comfy yet chic atmosphere."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how good the food is. I have been here for nearly one hour and i am still waiting for the food to be served. Deplorable service."}
{"text":"As a long -time fan of Eleven, I anticipated an equal experience from Derek Steven's new restaurant The Union Standard.  Unfortunately, that was not the case. The ramp fettuccini was al dente to the point of chewy.  The $12 baby green salad was just ok, nothing great.  Our biggest disappointment was the hosting staff.  The restaurant was not full - even on a Saturday night with the Penguins playing at home.  I asked if we could sit in one of the booths near the front - all three were empty.  The staff informed me that those were already reserved for parties of 5; we were 4 people. We ended up in a very small booth in the bar area.  But as we left, two of the larger booths were occupied with parties of 4, and a party of 4 was JUST being seated in the third --NOT parties of 5.  Hmmm...  When questioned, the manager appeared to be unconcerned and barely appologetic.  BTW - the reservation was made 3 weeks in advance; we arrived at 6:00; our reservation was for 6:30; we were dressed up. So will we return to The Union Standard? I doubt it.  Disappointing experience...  One positive note, our server was attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on their first day of serving lunch. Beautiful place and the service was excellent. Husband had the burger that came with a marrowsauce (yes, you read that right - mayonnaise infused with bone marrow). I was hesitant, but it was really good! I tried the chicken pot pie, which may sound boring, but it was very tasty with a lovely flaky crust. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Some good, some bad.  Despite the slow food service, everything ran pretty smooth for being open 2 days.  Our waitress was super helpful with the menu and we ordered a little bit of everything.  Some things that stood out: MUST get the Red Oak and Spinach, it had so much flavor, the potato bread was great, the sweet potato and squash soup felt lack it was lacking something (and the bread served with it got super soggy), the fries were below average, and the oysters were very good with a great variety.  We had the Union Mule and Promenade and both were fantastic.  Will definitely make a trip back.  The restaurant is a lot bigger than I expected with a nice, clean look.  We were seated in the back on the third level and felt sort of secluded.  No valet yet, so we had a hard time finding parking.  Worth a try!"}
{"text":"A group of us dined for a birthday and made reservations in advance. We were seated right away on the second floor. I didn't realize the space was that big. Something about the decor lacked personality - even the mural. Overall it has a clean, sleek appearance, but certain things felt chintzy and lifeless.  Drinks: I was a little disappointed by their cocktail list, so I ordered off-menu and got a Knob Creek Old Fashioned. It didn't disappoint! Kudos to the bartender.  Food: We started with the potato bread. I didn't find anything dynamite about it. In fact, if it didn't have the accompanying butters/spreads, it probably wouldn't have been eaten by the group. Several of us got the salmon dish. The skin was crispy, but other than that, the fish lacked flavor. At one point in the meal, two of us dining looked up and asked each other: \"are these frozen vegetables?\"  Service: Dutiful, but not overly warm."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch!  Nice trendy atmosphere. The food was amazing. The scramble was delicious!  Portions are not large but just the right amount of food. Our server Nate was amazing and so friendly. He was so helpful on telling us all of the attractions and things to do in the neighbourhood.  Right downtown and close to lots of hotels. Right next to the William Penn and Monarch hotel and walking distance to the Westin Overall a great place to go!"}
{"text":"This place will hopefully just get better.  I'll give it 4 stars although probably closer to 3-3 1/2.  Cool space, bar had a nice vibe.  Although the lower dining room where we sat I felt was really bright and cold. Next time I will ask for a different area.   The trout was great, and we liked the apps we ordered.  The Brassica was interesting and quite tasty. The Tartar was also nice with the sunflower seeds.  The pork chop, unfortunately, was not too great.  Done well, but not much flavor and the beans really clashed.   Overall had a great time and I am sure they will work out the kinks.  I appreciated not a huge menu and the wines were tasty!  Didn't try dessert...that's for next time!"}
{"text":"This ok if you like very average food. We were seated on the first floor with the kitchen on the 2nd floor.  The strip steak was cold. The roasted chicken was barely seasoned.  The laminate in the tables also appears cheap. Would be better with white table cloths."}
{"text":"Stopped in randomly when we were downtown. We had some of the best oysters we've had since we moved to pittsburgh from Washington state.  Kyle and the rest of the bar staff were amazing and Very welcoming.  The crab dip was unbelievable - Chunks of crab and fresh lemon flavor with homemade potato bread. Yum.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Union Standard is fun new restaurant in downtown Pittsburgh. Great ambiance and very spacious. Was able to have a conversation without yelling.  The blue crab dip was excellent. The trout was a generous serving and very flavorful. The lamb shank was good, but slightly disappointing. It reminded me of a pot roast.  I would recommend this restaurant and I plan on going back."}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh! Everything about it is fantastic! the service was excellent and the food was amazing!! There is enough variety on the menu that everyone in our table was satiated and happy. It was a wonderful experience, and I will be back there again"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, excellent food, decent service. None of the servers were extremely friendly, and many different people were tending to our table. We started off getting a cocktail at the bar, a simple cosmo and a manhattan - both were done just right. We then sat down at a table near the window. The food was outstanding, and it was nice that my friend and I were able to share a few things. We started with the scallops and steak tartare. We finished splitting the strip steak, which the kitchen so nicely separated into two dishes. Phenomenal and inventive sauces and garnishes on each plate. Really looking forward to visiting again soon; well done, Derek!"}
{"text":"We wanted a placed to grab some drinks and food after work. We arrived around 6 and sat at the bar until all 3 people in the group arrived. We all ordered a glass of wine. We moved to the table and ordered more drinks. We ended up ordering  skillet baked blue crab. It was full of crab and very good. The bread was very hard, too hard for my taste. I would have liked the bread a little softer. We ordered steak tartare! The chips were crisp and breakable. The tartare was more like bruschetta to me in terms of texture. We ordered the oyster especial which came with about 6 in the order. Over all good experience"}
{"text":"Great place to grab cocktails and a nice dinner with friends. The Pacific Northwest cocktail was refreshing and delicious. I had the steak tartare for my main and it was a hefty portion, enough to either share as an appetizer or as a main for a light meal. Very attentive servers and kind hostess. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Wow. This food is exceptionally bad. I asked the bartender for a recommendation and what I got was the most flavorless dish I've ever had."}
{"text":"Good mixed drinks...bartender knew what he was doing, nice decor, very friendly staff. Had some oysters and they were delicious.  I only stopped in for 1 drink and some oysters so I can't give a lot of feedback other than it seems like a nice place. I'll definitely be back for a full sir down meal one day."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant on a layover in Pittsburgh. I had a heavy lunch and thought a couple appetizers would be perfect. The first order was oysters from Maine and Alaska. They were very fresh and clean tasting. The second appetizer was the steak tartare. I was disappointed. There were several onions that were not uniformly chopped. They were the size of your pinky finger. It was not just one, but six large cuts compared to the rest cut properly. Also they used way too much mustard.  So much so that all you could taste was the mustard and you could not taste the mineral flavor of the raw beef. Lastly the beet chips were greasy and soggy.   The staff was friendly and polite. The friends I was with had the Monk Fish and they said it was delicious. So, I will give this place another try and just chalk it up to a bad plate that got by Chef."}
{"text":"Since this place opened, I have visited with friends for a birthday dinner and gone for lunch a few times. Every experience has been the same- food is delicious and bartenders/wait staff are friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. They also have specialty cocktails that really knock it out of the park- I have yet to try one I don't like. Food wise, their Brussel sprout salad is so yummy- and the asparagus soup (which has since been replaced with carrot) was heavenly. The oyster accompaniments are also to die for- the perfect finishing note to the fresh shucked oysters. The only negative about this establishment is that I do feel it's a bit pricey for the amount of food given. I will continue to splurge for lunch every once in awhile though, as the menu seems to rotate and I really like trying the new flavor combinations."}
{"text":"My first impression of Union Standard is that is had a cool vibe, great space, and a long wait. I ended up sitting at the bar for brunch and ordered the Ricotta Toast and Chicken Hash.   The ricotta toast was quite good. The bitter blood orange atop of the ricotta was perfect. The honey and pistachio made for a great finish.   The Chicken Hash, however, was a mushy mess. There was too much water from the poached farm egg in the dish when served. The potatoes were way over cooked to a mashed consistency and about half of the chicken was shredded while the rest was cubed. The water, potatoes, and semi-shredded chicken made for a odd paste like consistency that I just could not eat. The only thing left was the egg and chicharrones which were fine."}
{"text":"Since I can buy decent salmon for $6/bag at Aldi, I make it a point to avoid it at restaurants when I can. However, when our delightful server at US recommended it so highly, I had to try it. I'm SO glad I did. It was the best salmon I've ever had. Cradled on a bed of quinoa/grain goodness, the salmon was perfectly done, perfectly seasoned, and perfectly delicious. Looking around our party of 6, it was clear I'd made a great choice, but I'm sure the other menu offerings had redeeming qualities as well. Coupled with the excellent service and welcoming staff, I thoroughly enjoyed my brunch and look forward to returning for dinner!"}
{"text":"The sound level here is AWFUL. There is no way to have a conversation at your table. We asked twice to have the piped in music turned down. No luck. The food was very good and service excellent, but the noise ruined the meal. I doubt I will return. We ate early at 5pm and it was incredibly loud. They need to lower the music and add sound buffers."}
{"text":"My dining experience last night was nothing short of a triumph. From top to bottom, it was invigorating to sit awash in the success of such a new restaurant. Crossing the threshold I was amazed by the refined style of the building, and was promptly greeted by the charming and attentive staff at the host stand. My partner and I decided to enjoy our meal at the bar, which I was excited to see so busy at only 5:30!! A great sign for things to come.  One of the bartenders, Sam, a tall handsome brunette in glasses cleared a space for my partner and I, and flashed a knowing smile at us as he flawlessly prepared our cocktails. I thought to myself, \"This man knows what he's doing. He's so charming and confident, I'm in good hands tonight.\" The drinks themselves were perfectly balanced and the perfect way to start our meal. And the meal!!! We began with the baked blue crab, it came sizzling in the cutest aquamarine  baking dish, with an illuminating side of house made potato toast. For someone who doesn't eat much seafood, I was utterly taken aback by the creamy textures and the oceanic mascarpone. The Strip Steak was next, and I was suddenly escorted back in time, to a cool summer night, fireflies dancing to the cricket's cadence, my father humming under his mustache while he worked the grill.  5 Stars and a sincere congratulations to the wonderful hard-working folks at the Union Standard. Opening a restaurant in the current climate of this city is almost impossible, but I feel confident that this revelatory new addition will quickly find itself a staple, and will continue to delight the senses for many years to come."}
{"text":"Great drinks, great food, and an amazing dahntahn atmosphere. I got the Pennsylvania trout and my buddy got the house burger - we were both extremely impressed! The cocktail menu is on point. I recommend sitting at the bar. Definitely returning to try the other treasures of their menu!"}
{"text":"Beautiful building and a great interior. Really a nice spot to eat.   The food was okay - for the price and the hype I've heard, I had high expectations.   The fries and marrownaise were the high point.   The spicy bluefish sandwich was okay, but just okay.   The ginger chew on the hostess desk was awesome! In fact, that's probably my favorite thing I ate!"}
{"text":"Here are my thoughts: really beautiful, masculine and modern restaurant. The food is REALLY good, but also REALLY rich. There is something to be said about a clean, light dish that incorporates a little restraint. It's almost like every dish is trying to be the star of the show and there are no really interesting supporting characters. It's clear that Chef Stevens really put some thought into his dishes, which is cool. However, having an app for sharing, a starter, an entree AND dessert, will leave you feeling heavy and uncomfortable. I'd recommend sharing a Salad (which all are seemingly hearty) and then having an entree. You could really just have an entree and be good. We had the Salmon and Halibut, both really decadent. The desserts don't really stand up to the attention to detail and beautiful, luxe flavor profiles of the rest of the menu. In my opinion, for a restaurant that seems to have been really thought out in every capacity, the endings/desserts arnt even in the same playing field, but then again, we came there for dinner and, honestly, I'm not much of a dessert person. If they toned down the richness of their offerings, allowed for a few really lovely supporting characters, hired a pastry chef, Union Standard would be an absolute, hands down, home run."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I've ever received eating at an establishment in Pittsburgh. Almost left prior to ordering the entree."}
{"text":"Union Standard is a hip new restaurant in the bottom corner of the beautiful Union Trust building. A lot of the building was vacant for a long time, so to see this amazing restaurant take shape has been really great! Definitely start off your meal with their warm bread, it's perfection. Everything else I've tried on the menu has been really good. It's a bit pricey for a lunch downtown, but I think worth it. I've also heard it's a good spot for happy hour too, but I haven't gotten to check that out yet. Hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"Looking for a good lunch place downtown since our \"go-to\" place relocated to the suburbs, so we tried Union Standard.  It was ok.  Not bad but not great either.  Very limited and spotty menu.  I met 2 colleagues there and decided I wanted a sandwich for lunch.  Only 1 sandwich on the menu - butternut squash grilled cheese?  If you are a foodie, that might be attractive, but for the everyday professional who wants a decent place for lunch with a diverse menu, this is NOT the place.  Again, only 1 sandwich on the menu and 2 entree salads.  I had the pot pie since the butternut squash grilled cheese was not appealing.  It was good, but not great.  One of my lunch mates had the salmon and he said it was good but was not a fan of the mixed grain salad with sunflower seeds.  My other lunch mate had the grilled cheese.   She liked it, but said she would probably not order it again.  She wanted a side with it (fries or a salad, etc.) and they tag you for another $3.  It did not even come with a side...just a grilled cheese on a plate.  I will probably go back just because there is nothing else close to our building in town.  All in all, it was ok but not great."}
{"text":"Union Standard has been in my bookmarks for quite some time now, but today that changed. My friend and I had made brunch plans admittedly at a different restaurant. I completely forgot to make reservations until last minute and they couldn't take us until 1:30. We like to brunch early, so I made the suggestion of coming here after finding out they had open tables and we were not disappointed!   This is a restaurant with an ever evolving menu and changes based on the season. If you see something you would like to try, you better hurry on over before it disappears. Prices are pretty average for the quality of food you are receiving. There is a parking garage across the street which is very convenient and inexpensive.   We started off with our brunch cocktails. She ordered a bloody mary ($9) and I ordered a mimosa ($9). Lexi takes her bloody mary's very seriously. She raved about the pickled veggies! I would have to say that my mimosa was also very delicious and definitely wasn't lacking on the prosecco! We both ordered the griddled salami and swiss cheese potato bread ($11). It comes topped with whole grain mustard hollandaise and two eggs sunny side up. The salami and swiss are baked into the bread and it's pretty thick. The bread itself is soft and fresh. We did wish that they gave you two slices instead of one (we liked it that much). We like things saucy and they were not stingy on the delicious hollandaise sauce! I am so happy we got to give this place a try and I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a solid brunch spot.  Brunch is offered Saturday's and Sunday's from 10 - 2."}
{"text":"I must say after reading some of the negative reviews posted here that I was apprehensive about taking my wife here for anniversary dinner. However my adult son heard it was fabulous so we decided to ignore those reviews and check it out for ourselves. We were really glad that we did. We started out with a nice selection of oysters but at three dollars apiece we only shared three each. I could've crushed two dozen by myself. It was very fresh and sweet and I didn't even add any toppings. We also shared a shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were large and cooked perfectly, Nice and firm. We also enjoyed the calamari very much. The cauliflower gratin made a nice Side dish with our meals and was enough to share. For the main course I went with the lamb shank which was quite similar to an osa bucco and was delicious. My wife opted for the scallops and really enjoyed them. For her the highlight of the meal was the walnut pie which she raved about.   I was a little surprised about the decor because Other reviewer's that had posted about the classic building it is in. My expectation was that The restaurant would've been more old-fashioned but it turned out it was very contemporary. Nevertheless it was warm and inviting.   I definitely would return here and recommend it."}
{"text":"We liked the atmosphere of the bar and the restaurant. The drinks were good and service was decent (until near the end in the bar when it was super busy).   The food was amazing and restaurant service was top notch. Prices are high, but I'm willing to pay a bit more for really great food sometimes and this qualifies. The monkfish wrapped in bacon and scallops were both delicious. We were both torn between the two and neither of us made a bad choice (I tasted the scallops, too, and they were wonderful). The bread appetizer was super hot and delicious. We will definitely go back! Almost everything on the menu and delivered to nearby tables looked great."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with some coworkers. The space is nicely designed and has a cool vibe. My pesto pasta was more al dente than it should have been. A few pieces even crunched.  I might be back again to try something different as the fries and sandwiches at my table looked really good and everyone else seemed pleased with their selections. They also box up leftovers for you and give you a valet-esque ticket to pick it up at the front when you leave. I thought that was kind of cool."}
{"text":"After being here several more times since my first trip I am even more impressed.  My past time we ordered the warm potatoes bread appetizer.  Who knew bread could be so good.  The apple butter and garlic butter that come with it are incredible.  The only two things I have had are the union standard burger and the lamb patty melt.  These are two of my favorite sandwiches in Pittsburgh.  The burger is perfectly cooked every time and has great flavor.  The lamb patty melt is a very different sandwich.  It is fresh, juicy, and filling.  They also have some amazing onion rings."}
{"text":"We were disappointed by our evening at the Union Standard.  Atmosphere: We began by asking to be moved from our original table which was immediately next to the door to being sat at a table immediately next to the restroom. Atmosphere felt generally cold and it wasn't just the draft. Food and Drink: The wine glasses were still damp from their previous rinse before ending up on our table. Seriously? Wine however was reasonably priced across the board. We unfortunately found issues with nearly all the dishes we ordered and I struggled to say something positive about the experience after dinner.  Spinach salad was sopping wet with dressing and egg yolk.  Kumamoto oysters were small and relatively flavorless. These are my favorite oyster and I was disappointed with the quality. Homemade hot sauce and fresh horseradish was a nice touch however.  Beef tartare was average and lacked much flavor. The toast it was served with was cold and damp. Lame.  Scallop appetizer was just OK. Nothing memorable.  Suckling pig entree was under seasoned. Needed sauce and some contrasting texture. Ate half and had enough.  Fries were returned due to over salting and were removed from bill Service: Server was helpful and attentive despite the wine glass mishap.   Maybe things will improve with time but this place is not on the same level as other downtown establishments. I expected more from this chef after enjoying his offerings at Eleven for a number of years."}
{"text":"Quick solo lunch on a random afternoon while in town on business. Did not expect to be dazzled. Fried chicken sandwich was fantastic, and the French fries were coated in some magical combination of unicorn spice and fairy dust. Blown away. And fast, efficient, courteous service. Def going here again."}
{"text":"I believe this will be better as they blossom. Growth in any restaurant start up is work.   Service is a lil slow with food. Understanding we are 24 hrs in. And there will be tweaks to the staff as they develop.   Food: B-  The Skate had too much salt. Less salt it would be unbelievable.  I love Skate.   Steak Tartare: good  Calamari: ehhh  Stone Crab: lot of work and no mustard sauce, (needed )  Oysters: decent selection. I love Kumamoto Oysters. Check and on the menu.  Aioli French Fries: ran out of Aioli. Brought us straight mayo. ****UNACCEPTABLE   Cocktails: on par.  Crown of Stone: good Promenade: excellent   Wine list: eh"}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour oysters and ended up getting a whole lot more! Firstly, I cannot even say anything else without mentioning the potato bread. We ordered TWO because we destroyed the first one in seconds. Delicious. It is soft and has a sprinkle of salt on top. Comes with some really unique spreads. I then ordered a cauliflower side dish and it was absolutely large and filling enough to be a main dish. It was cheesy, and had bread crumbs on top. It was heavenly.  As for the service..it was great! They were pretty packed but the servers and bartenders are so sweet and helpful! I really had a good experience here. I wish I could think of better descriptive words! I will check out a dictionary and revise later.."}
{"text":"This restaurant gets 5 stars! The bar on the second floor is Stunning! I ordered a Mint Julep which was amazing, my boyfriend got an old fashioned and it was amazing as well! We were here to celebrate a birthday dinner and we ordered one of everything on the menu, literally!!! It was amazing! All of it... super flavorful! The crab dip was my fave .  the shrimp cocktail is tasty as well:)  everyone should check it out"}
{"text":"This is a cool spot downtown. The oysters and scallops were delicious and a must! However the service could use some work. I was impressed that our server didn't write down our order, that is until everything came out wrong. Wrong drinks, wrong number of oysters. On top of that, there were huge gaps in trying to order. We had to go to the bar to order some drinks since we couldn't find him."}
{"text":"Excellent spot in downtown Pittsburgh. Bartenders are a little stiff. They were efficient but not too customer friendly. It could mirror Pit toughness?  Clams were the best of my life and we eat a lot of clams East and West. Cider bacon and biscuit croutons. Genius dish. The Maitake mushrooms on croutons with goat Gouda were also stellar. The raw bar looks like it's on the coast. My seat mates at the bar raves about the wild shrimp and oysters"}
{"text":"This was a disappointment, ordered the burger med rare but came out well.  The bun was charred and there were onions all over the place.  Would not recommend for a burger, can't speak to anything else there other than the service, which was very good (that's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 2)."}
{"text":"There are many other better restaurants to visit in Pittsburgh. We took a friend from out of town and we were disappointed by all. Service pretty bad, food nothing that stands out. Ambiance like a cafeteria not high end restaurant. For the price I definitely will go to other places."}
{"text":"I go to Union Standard's happy hour from 4-6 at least twice a week and order their house white wine and cheeseburgler with fries and marrownaise- I am of the opinion it is the best in the city.  The exposed raw bar is something unique and their service is top notch- especially one bar tender in particular, Kylo- and a manager, Wayne.  I have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night.  Service was good.  Atmosphere is nice.  The menu looked intriguing but the resulting dishes were mixed in quality.   We started with the small loaf of bread (that came with no cutting knife and it was a little challenging to saw through it with a butter knife)  and the calamari with white beans.   The bread was tasty but the calamari dish was a salt bomb.   We ate it, and then drank a lot of water.  Main courses were okay, but none of them had the complexity or high notes we were expecting with all of the five star reviews we had read.  I got the dutch baby for dessert and I liked it a lot.    I guess at the end of the day we expected more from the reviews and the price point ,but hopefully they will find their groove over time."}
{"text":"I have really high expectations for a restaurant when I can't pronounce half of the words on the menu but Union Standard did not disappoint. Additionally, the bathrooms at this place were phenomenal.  I really recommend visiting the bathroom if you get a chance. LUCKILY my table was in a premo location right next to it.  Lot's of fish options on the menu...I would say it even gives Long John Silvers a run for it's money. They offered something called a swizzle on the drink menu. I pictured it with a crazy straw but I was a tad disappointed when it turned out to be an adult snow cone.  Definitely will be back here for the adult snow cones but I would love it if they put some PBR and lime-a-ritas on the drink menu to add some class"}
{"text":"Cute place and nice wait staff. Unusual food options but good food. The rigatoni was a little spicy to me, but I have a low tolerance for spicy foods. The skillet that the rigatoni was served in was straight out of the oven and made my food too hot to eat quickly. I had to dump it out and into the room temperature plate to be able to eat in my time frame. Also, the white cloth napkins left white fuzz on the black pants of myself and everyone I ate with. Also, realize that if you take the waiter up on sparkling water, you will be charged for it."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant I've been in in a long time. Maybe I caught it on a good night but this place should be packed."}
{"text":"First few moments were not good. Hostess stared at her screen utterly perplexed for a good five minutes after confirming we had a reservation, then finally determined what she needed to do next. Seated at what could possibly be the worst two-top in the house (right next to where all the servers are waiting for the their orders to come up, at the top of the stairs on the way to the restrooms), watered, and then...crickets. We sat for close to 15 minutes without being acknowledged by any server even tho literally six servers were standing next to our table at all times. We managed to flag down a hostess who found our server, who apologized very nicely and said he was negotiating with the kitchen for a GF diner at another table. He actually ended up being a fantastic server so all was forgiven there. Cocktails were skimpy (once you pulled the giant olives out of the martini there were three sips in the coupe), so we switched to a bottle of wine instead, which was a good selection from a nice but short list. Apps - husband said the tartare was \"soft\", whatever that means. The oyster and clam stew was delightful but TINY - I realize it's an app but it was still really little. Entrees - his pork chop was good and my burger was good but it was overcooked and needed some acidity - sweet onion, sweet pickle, and lots of fat need something to cut them a bit. A nice dill pickle or some mustard would have been welcome. Onion rings were crisp but kind of bland. The miso sauce was great. The dessert menu, to me, was a complete miss, so we walked over to the Commoner and had sticky toffee pudding. All told. the food was good but I expected more from Derek Stevens. The place is incredibly loud (and it might be better on a weeknight because it was packed) so this is not a romantic restaurant or someplace I'd recommend if you want to have an quiet conversation. The parking situation is weird (take a ticket, garage door opens, and there's a valet inside, then you have to walk back outside to the restaurant), and the walk from the garage to the restaurant includes being treated to the smell of rotting fish (not sure if there's a garbage chute or what, but not appetizing). All in all, I won't put US on our regular rotation but if a friend wanted to go there I wouldn't protest."}
{"text":"Great place, I will be back! Arrived early for meeting up with friends and had a drink at the bar. Great bartender (can't recall his name unfortunately), fun atmosphere, and great view looking into the restaurant space as well as out the large windows seeing the foot traffic outside. Had the strip steak with chimichurri sauce following sharable appetizers and everything was very good. Comfortable, modern decor. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Location: On William Penn Place and Oliver Ave. Located in Historic District of downtown. Short walk for BNY and Steel Tower employees. Inside of the Union Trust Building. *Once the Union Arcade, a storefront mall, of 230 stores built by Henry Clay Frick in 1917.... must explore the history of this building and walk through it to see the open vault dome inside.  Restaurant: Trendy and Modern. Soft Lighting and Various Seating Options (High Tables, Private Tables and Seating on 2nd Floor, Low Tops and Booths) The atmosphere is comfortable, warm and calm.   Food: The chef Derek Stevens was known for working as executive chef at Eleven and also at the Duquesne Club, Casbah and Hyeholde. The food is artistic and well-balanced contemporary American. You can order anything from a kale salad to a ribeye to a cauliflower shnitzel. They have an excellent raw bar and east coast oyster selections. Also, many options for vegan and gluten free foodies.  Service: Jigmed and Wayne are excellent managers that will take great care of you and ensure all of your needs are met. This includes private parties and large group accommodations.  The wait staff know the menu very well and are attuned to giving great recommendations.   Overall: It's a must-do in downtown. One of the best restaurants in the Historic District and fair priced. It should be $$ instead of showing $$$ to accurately describe the cost. They have an excellent happy hour with $1 oysters and discounted drinks. The menu is diverse and changing and it is a reminder of the chef's experience as your changing appetite is satisfied each visit. It's very relaxing and impressive and it's very rare when you find a location that the food quality exceeds the price point."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Four of us went here for a Saturday night out. We were sat upstairs in a corner by the restrooms, not exactly the atmosphere you want for upscale dining. We waited over 15 minutes for someone to greet us and provide water. Our waiter had a waiter-in-training and made no issue making it known that he was not pleased to have to train someone. The crappy service continued all night. We literally had to flag other waiters to get our waiter to wait on us and at one point ordered our drinks 2 at a time because it took about a half hour to get a drink. The food wasn't much better. I got the monkfish, my fiance got the rib-eye, and our friends got the clams and salmon. While the potato bread was excellent, the rest of the food was bland and unremarkable. Definitely NOT worth the price.   Sub-par food, terrible service - all four of us agreed, Union Standard is overrated and under-delivers. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I'd been looking forward to trying out this new addition to the downtown restaurant scene for some time despite the mixed reviews.  I was a bit taken aback that the place was only about half full at 8PM on a Saturday night, hmm.   Overall, good although not particularly impressive or memorable.  Service was quite good as were the mixed drinks.  I'd probably go back but sadly I wouldn't put Union Standard within the top 10 in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Ate here for Valentine's Day 2/14/18. It was dead inside. Few other couples. Service was good with exception of getting recommendations from the waitress staff. She was attentive but not able to offer much opinion. Meal tasted good fresh ingredients but honestly for the price expected FAR higher end. The \"massive seafood appetizer to share\" I was hunk was 6 bites of mixed seafood. Not 6 each, I mean 2 shrimp bites, 2 lobster bites 2 seafood salad bites and maybe all. I could eat 3 myself. Needless so say PORTIONS VERY SMALL. Not enough courses to make up front like other comparable high end \"small portion\" places tend to do. Wouldn't choose to go back but I'd eat there if invited to some gathering."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for an early dinner as we were in town for another appointment.    The Union Standard is beside the Omni William Penn and Mellon Square, making it a great location close to everything.  The multi-level restaurant is attractive and was well attended during the early Friday evening when we were there. The staff was courteous and professional in their attention to detail.  I had the roasted chicken and my wife the scallops. We thought that both meals were well prepared and tasty.  The menu, while limited had a nice selection that I believe everyone could find something to like.   The prices were (we thought) a bit high, but we did think the food was very good, so we felt we received value for what we paid."}
{"text":"I was seated upstairs on a Wednesday night. I got the cauliflower and benne soup which was pretty good. The main course was fantastic- bacon wrapped roasted monkfish. The gravy was great as well. All pretty healthy.  Definitely my go to place from now on. One of the restaurants where you get your money's worth."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin but I guess I'll start by saying his brunch was AMAZING! A friend and I planned to check out Or, The Whale but sadly couldn't get a reservation so we ended up switching it to Union Standard. At the time I was upset but looking back I'm so happy it happened.  The restaurant itself is super cute. It's not super big but it's not super tiny either. The tables are nicely spaced out into different sections which almost makes it feel more intimate. As if you aren't in a restaurant with tons of other people. It was really nice.  I told myself I wouldn't get a drink at brunch today but I caved and got a bloody mary. Boy am I glad I caved! The flavor was delicious and the pickled veggies on top were to die for. It came with a pickled green bean, cauliflower, garlic glove, pickle, and a sweet pepper. Each one of them having the perfect flavor. They were clearly made fresh in house and you could tell by the crisp, fresh flavor. They weren't pickled too much or too little. They were pickled just enough to give it a very mild but awesome flavor.   For my entree I switched the giddled salami and swiss eggs at the very last second. I somehow completely missed it on the menu and I'm beyond grateful that my friend pointed it out to me. The dish has a thick piece of toast with salami slices in it that is toasted on both side. On top of that is 2 fried eggs with a outrageously delicious hollandaise sauce. I don't think I've ever tasted a hollandaise sauce that good. All of those flavors mixed together was out of this world. I truthfully debated ordering a second plate and I haven't stopped thinking about it all day.   On top of all that, the prices are actually reasonable. All too often I check out brunch spots and the drinks are outrageous and so are the entrees. My total only came to $21 which I think is extremely reasonable for a brunch. Granted they do have some pricier options on the menu but for the most part it all looked like fair prices in my opinion.  Union Standar, I will definitely be back for you soon! I will use any excuse to bring someone else here for some delicious brunch."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch and the food was fantastic. I'm not vegetarian but I ordered an egg dish with cream cheese and mushrooms and it was amazing. It was cooked perfectly and the mushrooms were of high quality. I loved the way the cream cheese was blended with the eggs. The Bloody Mary was also pretty good though a little pricey.  The service was excellent and the dining area was bright and open with modern decor. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I just don't get it.  I've been to so many other restaurants in Pittsburgh that are much better.  Went here for brunch on a Saturday.  From the beginning with the utterly disinterested hostess to the waiter who acted as if he didn't really care if we were there or not to the food/drink runners who REALLY didn't care that the drinks we ordered took 20 minutes to get to us it was totally dissatisfying.  The food was stale and tasted as if it had been prepared last night.  The drinks were completely overthought and not very enjoyable.  Honestly we left and went to Urban Tap and had a much better dining experience.  For context, we eat in a lot of restaurants of all $$$$ amounts so we're not unfamiliar with the trends in cuisine.  No reason to ever go back here and this is not one of the best restaurants in the City.  It's not even one of the best restaurants downtown."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a Saturday. Had the \"Ricotta Toast\" for a lighter option. It was incredibly delicious (especially the roasted grapefruit on top- something I've never had before). I especially liked the vibe of the restaurant- I felt like I was in New York or a bigger city.  I didn't try any of the cocktails or mimosas because the price was a little high for a brunch time alcohol. While the mimosas were advertised on the sign outside they didn't list them on the menu (unless I missed it).   Overall would recommend but also need to try more items!"}
{"text":"Went in for a tasting for a potential company buyout. Food was amazing, seasonal, fresh and a delight to try. We ordered the breakfast breads, goat cheese toast, fried chicken salad, gruyere leek omelet, pesto rigatoni. Everything was divine! Goo goo goo!  Also, that biscuit passed my southern girl soul food test.  Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Went to Union Standard for lunch. It was great. Has the pea and asparagus soup with the potato bread. All were delicious and the service was super"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there last night and had a great experience.      The design of the place is beautiful with three levels and we said up on the third level.   It is a fairly large restaurant but doesn't feel big because of how everything is arranged.     The server was very helpful and the food was top notch.   I had the pork chop which was prepared with polenta.    My wife had the Branzino which was the better of the two dishes but you can't go wrong with either.       For dessert don't miss the Dutch baby."}
{"text":"I was staying at the William Penn for work, and had an hour for lunch, so I decided to go to Union Station for expediency.   I'd heard about their raw bar - which is why it was weird that, as I sat down, I was offered all kinds of menus but not the one for the raw bar. I had to ask for it, which took the waiter about 5 minutes to bring it back.   The food was AMAZING!  I had 5 kinds of oysters, including some amazing ones. I also had the popcorn with Foie Gras, and the hamachi with grilled ramps (fantastic!).   Service, however, was lacking. It was 2:30pm, the restaurant was mostly empty. And yet, things took forever, and waiters would disappear often. When I was ready to leave, there was literally no staff within eye or earshot.   So, definitely go for the food and ambiance (it's a beautiful restaurant), and forgive the service."}
{"text":"This place is positioned right in between other trendy restaurants/bars such as the Commoner and Speak Easy which makes it convenient to have a few cocktails before heading here for dinner.   The restaurant is very spacious and modern.  The service was wonderful.  Very attentive and genuinely nice.  My husband and I had 2 cocktails each.  They were very well made and had ingredients such as maraschino and other popular spirit forward liquors.  It did take a little longer to get our cocktails vs. the food we ordered.  We got oysters and the steak tar tar for starters.   Both were delicious.  The portion of steak tar tar was really large.  I got the cod for my main.  It was just ok, not really a lot of flavor, so that is why I am giving only 4 stars.  It was a little disappointing after such delcious appetizers.  It was a little expensive, so I would try this place again and get the steak or something other than the fish next time."}
{"text":"Omg.  Absolute longest wait ever.  Reservation at 645. Seated right away then waited 25 minutes for our waitress.   35minutes later still waiting for our dinner. This is ridiculous"}
{"text":"I was dining alone and decided to sit at the bar to avoid a wait for a table. I had a Red Oak  and SpinachSalad. Best Salad ever. When you say salad it seems like such a simple dish, however the attention to detail and the depth of flavor built here was amazing. The crispy fried pork croutons melted in your mouth like a flavor bomb of pork goodness. I also discovered a new ingredient in the leek ash that they included in their leek ash & buttermilk dressing that I went home and used in my next grilled item at home. It's a must try place to east especially in this part of the downtown area."}
{"text":"This was an amazing restaurant. The food and service was outstanding. It was a dining experience. Wayne the manager was top notch and was very accommodating. He was friendly and went above and beyond. I would recommend this restaurant and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"2.5 stars, rounding up to 3. My aunt and I had a reservation on a weekday and were seated immediately at a comfortable little table upstairs, but that's the only truly positive comment I have about Union Standard. Service was very slow and it took 15 minutes for someone to come and take our drink order. We both ordered a glass of wine. The restaurant wasn't busy, yet it was another 15 minutes before the drinks made it to the table. Strike one. I will say the wine I selected (a syrah by the glass) was quite good once I finally had it in front of me to taste. We ordered stone crabs for an appetizer and they were dinky, not super fresh and served without the appropriate tools (fork + shell cracker). After what seems like forever, I received my main course (salmon) and it was okay, but not spectacular. The fish was cooked perfectly, but it had minimal flavor and the side portion was so small (about 1-2 TBSP of butternut squash micro cubes) that I felt hungry (salmon was about 6 oz). My aunt had tartare and said it was just okay. We both love Eleven, so we were expecting great things from Chef Derek's new baby, Union Standard, but it's almost as if he left Eleven and forgot how to cook. The restaurant does not validate or discount parking in the semi-attached garage. I won't return to Union Standard since there are so many better options at that price point in the city.     TL;DR: Cool space, bad service, unexceptional food."}
{"text":"Finally, finally, finally, Union Standard is open for lunch!  Hip! Hip! Hooray!   Okay, I have been anticipating the opening of this restaurant for quite some time.  And since I don't live in or near Downtown Pittsburgh, my first forays to new restaurants are usually during lunch time.  (Better to explore a new restaurant at lunch during working hours, than to commit to a long drive, expensive parking and an expensive meal that you may or may not like during dinner hours.)  The restaurant is located on the corner of Oliver and William Penn in the Union Trust building and decorated in a very tailored and no-nonsense way.  No frou-frou, just clean and simple lines on multiple levels.  I liked the décor. (I can see this spot becoming home to frequent power-lunchers.)  Me and one half of the usual dynamic duo (The other usual suspect was out of town this week.) ventured there and were seated immediately. (I made reservations and I suggest that you do the same.)  The hostess was extremely welcoming and our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu.  My crime partner ordered the Elysian Fields Lamb Patty Melt served on rye with bacon, Swiss, roasted sweet onion, caramelized onions and whole grain mustard.  I ordered the Crispy Halibut Sandwich - cornmeal fried and served on potato bread with cabbage & carrot slaw and smoked pepper remoulade.  We also ordered a side of fries which came sprinkled with their house seasoning and pickled red onions. (I've never seen fresh-cut fries served with pickled red onions, but they worked because they cut through the oiliness of the rich foods that we were eating.)  Both of us cut off portions of our sandwiches to share with one another and they were both delicious!  The halibut portion size was extremely decent, as well as the lamb patty. (Note: The fish appeared and tasted like it was breaded with a type of panko instead of cornmeal, but it was still delicious!)  And since I'm not really a ketchup person, our fries were served with a house-made aioli and a dill dressing.  Both sauces were outstanding. (Note: Fries or sides are not served with the sandwiches, but ordered separately.  However, the $5 portion could have easily fed three people if accompanying a sandwich.)  I would just like to make a suggestion that the owners list the potential side dishes on the menu, so you don't have to ask and so that customers know for sure that sides aren't included with the Sandwiches & Mains.  Tipping a little over $20 for lunch, including tax and tip, we got pretty much what we expected...a high quality meal in a place that allows you, for one moment, to assume that you are a mover and shaker and this is where you should eat."}
{"text":"Came for their Easter brunch - this is clearly one of the best brunch places in Pittsburgh.  The menu is unique and I can't wait to come back and try more items.  The bread plate is a must-try. It comes with this special goat-milk butter which is delicious.  The grilled salmon is made to perfection on bed of lentils and peas, which tastes very fresh and flavorful.  I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Only stopped in for drinks but we had an absolutely stellar experience. My mule (I forget the specific name of it) was truly one of the best I have ever had. That is saying a lot because I have spent a good portion of my life running restaurant properties that execute fresh/scratch bars. My wife had the mint julep and loved it too. Also impressive execution here, not too sweet, nice fresh mint, could still taste the Bulleit...nice job! I am looking forward to coming back for a meal. Glad you have a raw bar, looking forward to oysters too!"}
{"text":"Interesting place.  Walk in and a large mural on one wall.  The place and the bar seems a little on the cold side atmosphere wise due to the mostly darker gray color.   It has only been open a few days but the service was very good and our server seemed pretty knowledgeable about the menu.  The bar has a decent amount of beer about 8 on tap and 8 or so in bottles, a decent wine list and of course fancy drinks.  There is a small oyster bar with several different types of oysters, stone crab claws and lobster and some interesting Snacks at the bar. Started with the Jubilee Steak Tartare that had sunflower seeds, sprouts, pickled garlic and deviled egg dressing with a couple of great homemade potato chips sticking out of the top. I enjoyed the tartare but it seemed a little bland to me.  For the main course the Lamb shank was tender and one of the better lamb shanks I have had.  Was not hungry for desert but had some wonderful Millie's Sorbert.  Looking forward to returning to try some of the other items and desert to go along with a dessert drink."}
{"text":"In my check-in I said Union Standard set the standard. It did...below standard. The building in which it is housed is historic and stunning. It drops off sharp after that. The decor in the restaurant has that industrial cafeteria/assisted living commissary feel. Multiple levels of dun colored boxes as charming as a used car lot in Jasper, Texas. There was a long bar with  sleepy staff and a raw bar with sleepy oysters.      On Thursday night at peak dinner time it was empty and that should've been a sign. The menu was limited, but actually it was the kitchen that was limited.   The Vibe: Who goes there? Apparently, almost no one. A few stray office hoppies and tourists who read and trusted the current Eater Top 10. Eater will need a good talking to.   The Bar Program: There was a list of house cocktails with indecipherable ingredients that defied a google search. (Bluecoat, Dolin Blanc, Salers...sounded like a home remedy for a Thrush infection.) Have a draft.   The Staff: Well, she tried. (She tried my nerves.) \"You have to have the Chicken. It's the most amazing thing you will ever eat,\" she implored. My bud gave in and ordered the Chicken. \"I am so thrilled and excited you ordered the Chicken!\" she gushed with a straight face. The poor thing was actually breathless and quivering. Save the candy and flowers with that one and just buy her a chicken and hope for the best. Alas, the Chicken was \"86\" by 7:30 PM. The chicken had crossed the road before we got there.    \"I'll have the Steak Tartar to start please.\" To start what? A fire? It was a tasteless cylinder of meat mush (useful in getting the charcoal going in the chimney perhaps). A piece of cold stale bread grilled once in it's life was on the plate along with potato chips I could bend in half without breaking. The steak was a compressed disk of sawdust topped with Sunflower Seeds, Sprouts, Pickled Garlic, with Deviled egg Dressing, none or which belongs in this dish. Or maybe they all do in this version.      I'll just have some warm Potato Bread and Butter with my warm beer. Alas, the bread was cold and as soft as dust bunnies.   The Brussels Sprouts, Castlefranco and Bibb Salad with Boiled Miso Dressing. Roasted Garlic Croutons, Hidden Hills Dairy Allegheny (cheese, I think) came next masquerading as a salad.   It was all shredded beyond recognition. If you like eating green dental floss...dig in. I think a Brussells Sprout had been rolled around and over the mess before service and then reserved for something else.    So far the food was fit for a King. Now where did that German Shepherd get to?    The Grilled Lauren Bay Calamari under under-braised Escarole, canned White Beans, and a charred Lemon was forgettable.The Escarole had sand in it to make the squid feel at home? The Escarole must have been washed with a squirt gun at 10 paces.   Next came the Whole Wheat Fettuccine with Serenity Hills Farm Lamb (the lamb must have had followed the Chicken across the road because it was MIA), Peas, Kale, Chive Butter, Maitake, and Goat Rodeo Stampede (this must have been cheese). It's okay to use stinky cheese but not cheese that stinks. At best it was astringent and had an Ammonia finish. It tasted like a goat's groin after you chased it uphill all day. (Please don't ask how I know what that tastes like.) The Gorilla Glue Sauce couldn't hide it and it too was horrid on it's own. Okay, this glop of cement had been left in the pot for the starch to congeal. Stick a fork in it and the whole tangle came up together in one chewy lump. Inedible.That was a rookie's mistake. Leave the cooked pasta sit for an hour and voila this is what you get. Why not cook it al dente, and quickly mix it with pasta water and a tasty sauce that will stay down? Maybe just get more hours on your day job and throw in the towel cooking here at night?   The French Fries (an impulse buy) were as limp as a sleeping puppy's feet. The soggy pile came with Marrownaise adding no taste and plenty of calories.   The manager listened to our complaints patiently and without disagreement, I might add, and offered two comped desserts. The Ice Cream Sandwich was Maple Oat Ice Cream that tasted like neither of those ingredients. There were some diagonals of bananas (big deal), and two Coconut Macaroons. Aren't those supposed to be soft, moist and chewy? One dropped on a plate and cracked it. The other fought off the point of a steak knife previously employed to deal with the pasta. A vice and a chain saw may not have worked. Enjoy snacking on a cue ball? Order this.   The Chocolate Dutch Baby came with Salted Caramel Ice Cream, Marshmallows (not needed or adding anything to the dish) and Chocolate Sauce (probably store bought) and renamed Ganache and a few soft candied Pecans. In all fairness it was actually manageable, but if you give a typewriter to an infinite number of monkeys eventually you will get Hamlet.   Union Standard is closer to American Standard."}
{"text":"Impeccable service and the fries are worth a five star review! The menu is quite small and I don't think it really covers a full gamete of tastebuds. The burger on the bar menu was perfect."}
{"text":"This was probably one of the best dinners I've had in Pittsburgh. The ambience is subtle allowing the old buildings across the street to shine- the William Penn, Oliver building and Mellon square comprised a beautiful backdrop. We started with a selection of oysters and the potato bread. The oysters were fantastic served with lemon, fresh horseradish and two other sauces. The potato bread was a little loaf sprinkles with salt and dill. Two butters and a tomato chutney complimented it perfectly. We tried the Heirloom  Tomato salad which featured fresh tasting red and yellow tomatoes, some greens and cornbread croutons. I wasn't wild about the croutons, they had a funny texture but the salad was good otherwise. We tried the cauliflower schnitzel and the cauliflower gratin. The schnitzel was a miss for me although tasty. The fried cauliflower was a little too oily. However the cauliflower gratin was the best second only to my mother's. We finished with a watermelon upside down cake which was amazing. It was both moist and crispy topped with plum sorbet and a lovely sour cream. The service was so helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. What a great addition to the Pittsburgh food scene."}
{"text":"My experience at Union Standard was amazing. I started with the Promenade cocktail which was mixed perfectly and was a perfect light start to my meal. For an appetizer, I ordered the scallops - they were perfectly cooked and the flavor combination with the chicken broth was delicious.   Now for the main course - the Lamb Shank. I rarely order anything other than chicken or steak but I was feeling adventurous. I will honestly say I had an out of body experience eating this. It was the best piece of meat I've had in a long time! ;) The serving size was very generous - two very large cuts on top of multiple types of potatoes and just enough gravy."}
{"text":"I've been excited to try out Union Standard since they opened a few weeks ago.  I went with a friend for Friday night cocktails and a few apps, hoping to check out the new establishment.  We quickly found two seats at the bar, and settled in.  It felt a little trendy, a little industrial, but overall a great comfortable bar that I imagine was probably very crowded a few hours before we arrived.  The bartender was upbeat and lovely, and she handed us several menus, food, drinks, cocktails etc. I went with the Pinkerton  and loved it!  I'm a sucker for herbs in my drinks, so the sage and pepper was delightful.  My friend went with a glass of pinot gris and pour was generous.  I would definitely go back for drinks.  My friend is a vegetarian, and I will say that the options were pretty limited. We went with the kholrabi app and split the squash entree.  We skipped on the potato bread, but next time I think we'd add that onto the order as well.  All of our food was decent, but a little on the bland side.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying some other menu items, specifically the oysters, but as for vegeterian-friendly food, I'm not sure this would be my go-to spot.  Overall it was a great happy hour, business casual, cocktail spot and a nice addition to the downtown bar scene."}
{"text":"I couldn't have asked for a better meal for my birthday! My friend and I chose to go to Union Standard for the first time for my birthday and it certainly did NOT disappoint!  When trying to decide on an appetizer we both decided squash blossoms were the choice as we had both never had them before.  I'm not sure how I never had them before - they were SO absolutely scrumptious.  I could have certainly had them as my meal.    For my entree - I got the salmon.  2 things to point out with the salmon 1.  I asked for it rare.  It wasn't.  But that was NOT a problem.  The flavor made up for it.  2.  I am a salt heavy type of person.  (Although I never ask for it when it is not on a table).  This did not need any additional seasoning (In a good way!)  It was absolute perfection flavor wise.    We chose not to get a dessert - but our sweet waitress still brought us a slice of brownie with a candle for my birthday.    If you haven't been to Union Standard - go.  I have already told many people about it and how scrumptious the food was.  I can't wait to go back for brunch and dinner again!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Every item on their menu we tried was fresh and delicious. Cold and fresh oysters with shaved horseradish and a green apple migonette. The Speck with Melon salad was beautiful and delicious. The sauteed Calamari with white beans was flavorful and perfectly cooked. The whole Branzino entree was creatively prepared and amazingly tasty. We will be back....I promise!"}
{"text":"Always a great variety of local meats and produce in all dishes. Great appetizers and dessert options. Can't wait to try their brunch!"}
{"text":"I have one weekend a year where I host a group of out of town guests for work. They are serious about their food and booze and Union Standard did not disappoint. I'm pretty sure we had one of everything on the menu and it was all amazing. I have very happy campers."}
{"text":"Went during happy hour. Half price oysters were great--fresh and interesting paired vinegars. Unfortunately they do not have saltine crackers (which i eat with my oysters) but the waitress offered my toasted bread instead, which was nice. Seemed to be a more crowded happy hour but it didn't affect the service."}
{"text":"Went here before Prince tribute and had some good food and drinks. Oysters fresh and tasty. Calamari good. Scallops  good. Squash soup good. Three of us got the Branzino whole fish. Subtle moist and tasty. Steak tartar and mussels. Cocktails great best Moscow mule I ever had. Good wines nice port. Service was great everyone was so attentive. Not slow like some other reviews stated. Got there at 5 had a rez. Out by 7 plenty of time to walk to show. Atmosphere a little cold. Booths were cool on street level. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wow do I like it here. The ambience is lovely for a weekday lunch seated in the front dining area or after work dinner, happy hour in the bar. The decor is clean, modern, simple with style and comfort. The cocktails are refreshing and made with local alcohol from distributors such as Boyd & Blair. My favorite is the Promenade. The heirloom tomato salad is really amazing and full of flavor. The scallion vinaigrette is the best I've had in a very long time. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Went here on the second night of service, and was impressed.   We got there about an hour early and headed to the bar. Tyler was helpful with recommendations and made a mean cocktail. We had the Union Mule and the Mint Julep, both were excellent. We opted to order a few things from the raw bar: 2 Kumamoto Oysters, 2 Cranberry Creek Oysters, and 2 Littleneck Clams and an order of the Smelts from the bar snack menu. The accompaniments for the raw bar are really great and I enjoyed the fresh shaved horseradish and the homemade hot sauce. My husband said the mignonette sauce was delicious. The smelts were also well cooked and the charred lemon was a nice touch.   The hostess then came over to the bar to let us know that our table upstairs was ready and gave us a few moments to settle up at the bar, and then lead us to a small banquette table between two others. We had nice companions on our side and spent much of dinner conversing with them, but if that is not to your liking you may want to request a more private table.   Our waitress was very helpful, but sadly I can not recall her name. We ordered 2 share plates the potato bread which is phenomenal and a must order and the blue crab skillet. Though the blue crab was good and had plenty of crab it fell a little flat for us, we felt like it needed a touch more seasoning, but luckily my husband grabbed the hot sauce from our raw bar plate from earlier and brought it with us to the table and it was delicious on the dip.   We later ordered some firsts to share rather than an entree, though I will say as it was the 2nd night they were out of 3 entrees by the time we went to order(a hiccup that I know will be rectified with time). We decided to share the Sea Scallops, the Tartare, and the Red Oak and Spinach Salad. My husband loved the tartare! The Red Oak and Spinach Salad is a must order! We did end up sending back the scallops due to them being overcooked, but again something that will get better with time.   For dessert we had the German Chocolate Donut which is topped with Millies Homemade Salted Caramel Gelato. This dessert was phenomenal!   I can't wait to go back and try some of the entrees and definitely to get that salad again!"}
{"text":"Still good but a few issues.  First, the wine list remains very basic. Limited selections of non-descript bottles.  They really need to up their game with wine or it's BYOB time.  The calamari appetizer was a bit disappointing.  Flavor was very good, but mostly beans and just some ringlets and one tentacle in my opinion did not justify the price.  The scallop main course was first rate.  Nice portion and wonderful flavor."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is amazing. It feels like a genuine piece of pittsburgh. The longer I spent here, the more in awe of the place I became. The cocktails were mind blowing (I especially loved the Rosemary Tuco because it spoke to the bourbon girl in me). I recommend the baked crab starter. There aren't words to describe how delicious it is. Just imagine the most perfect lumps of crab meat you've ever eaten..... now realize that they will pale in comparison. If all of that weren't enough, I had the ribeye. My god that ribeye. Now just in case you were wondering if I spent all of my time drinking and shoving food into my face.... allow me to inform you  (unfortunately) that wasn't the case. I had great conversations there with the service staff about their recommendations on cocktails, starters, entrees, etc. You would've never known that this place is brand new with the knowledge they had to offer me. It was an all around stellar experience and I look forward to going back very, very soon!"}
{"text":"This is NOT one of the best brunches in Pittsburgh - contrary to what numerous articles say. It was mediocre at best. The pastries were cold, dry, and tasted like store bought Enteman's. The French toast was dry and flavorless - basically dry bread. The scrambled eggs similarly had no flavor. For a restaurant getting a lot of press, it was a big disappointment. I won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Downtown's new offering of raw oysters at Union Standard caught my attention late on a Wednesday after work. The decor is modern with plenty private nooks. The menu was vast and impressive but we opted? to try the raw bar  and drinks. They rotate the oyster varieties every Week and had 2 each of East coast and west coast oysters on this day. We tried a raw oyster platter of 2x all 4 varieties, shrimp cocktail, and crab claws. The oysters were wonderful and fresh and the server was knowledgeable and answered all my questions.  He helped me pair our sea food with a wonderful Gewurztraminer from Cave Springs  Winery. They? were served with cocktail sauce, a house hot sauce that was amazing, a apple vinaigrette, shaved horseradish and lemon. The crab and the shrimp were ok but nothing special.   The seafood is served over a fake rubber seaweed that frankly disappointed me. Such an upscale restaurant should have a better presentation for their seafood than rubber seaweed."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by staff at my hotel. Jason had a full understandings of the menu and made several recommendations.  Selecting the sea scallop was an excellent choice. Large, cooked and seasoned spectacularly (Thank you Chef), accompanied by fresh carrots, micro-green, radishes, and a light dressing, the sea scallops took on another life of their oen  Thrilled with my lunch, with one day left in the 'burgh', I hope that I can return for dinner."}
{"text":"I took the fiancee here for her birthday because she loves raw oysters.  We will definitely be going back.  Everything about this place emanated a fresh perspective on Pittsburgh dining downtown.  Each dish was unique and extremely tasty.  Our server was Timothy F and was great.  He was fast, efficient, knowledgable and not full of BS that you sometimes get with higher end dining.  He even accommodated my birthday request (see dessert section).  We started with drinks.  She had the Rum Arcade and I had a dirty Ketal One martini, up.  Both drinks were outstanding and the bartender knows what they are doing.  The Rum Arcade is on the sweet side FYI.  Next she sampled two of each of their raw oyster offerings.  She had 3 from the East Coast and one from California.  The best ones were the Windmill Points from VA.  She said the texture and flavor was simply awesome.  The two from New York were not as good which surprised me because she always likes Blue Points...  The other standout was from CA and neither of us can remember the name!  I want to say it was Choco Point...but thanks to the stiff drinks we both forget.  The CA oysters were unique with great flavor.  She said they were like little balls, similar to a cooked mussel.  5/5  For sharing we got the Skillet Baked Blue Crab.  Simply amazing.  The amount of lump crab was perfect and the flavors changed as we ate it.  The crostinis were delicious but seemed to explode when we bit into them.  The trick is to let them sit for 30 seconds so they absorb some moisture.  5/5  For appetizers she got the Sea Scallops and I got the Smoked Potato & Goat Cheese Soup.  The (2) scallops were 2.25\" across but cooked perfectly.  The chef knows what they are doing because they were tender, juicy and still had a perfect burnt crust.  I just wish there were 4 of these so I could have had another.  :-)  5/5  The Smoked Potato & Goat Cheese Soup was great.  It was thin for potato soup but still creamy.  I would have liked a little more goat cheese because that really made the soup.  4/5  Her main course was the Skuna Bay Salmon cooked medium.  It was a true medium with slightly raw in the middle so be forewarned, you do not have to order a level down if you want some red in the center.  She said it was delicious but didn't understand the pairing of the beans.  While everything was good she thought it would be better with a pasta or rice.  I ordered the Elysian Fields Farm Lamb.  It was outstanding and cooked perfectly.  5/5  For dessert she had the Blood Orange Upside-down Cake and I had the German Chocolate Doughnut.  Since it was her birthday I asked them to do something special for her dessert and they threw a candle in the ice cream.  This was perfect since we tackle anyone (ask our server about that one...) that tries to sing Happy Birthday.  She said her dessert was great but I know it was not as good as mine.  The German Chocolate Doughnut was fricking awesome.  I almost finished it and will order it again.  The salted caramel, cream...some kind of brittle.  It was just awesome and you should order it.  We highly recommend this place and will be going back.  $180"}
{"text":"Outstanding lunch for my friend and I. We had the roasted butternut squash grilled cheese sandwich, Mesclun salad with Goat Rodeo Cowboy coffee, roasted sunflower seeds, avocado, and vinaigrette, the crispy cod sandwich, Grist House Fire on the Hill IPA, and tea. The food is top quality, with great attention to detail. Excellent in every way.  This lunch couldn't have been better. Worth every penny. Our server, Ross, was pleasant, knowledgeable, fast, and not intrusive.  This is what a meal downtown should be. I'll be back. I can't recommend it highly enough."}
