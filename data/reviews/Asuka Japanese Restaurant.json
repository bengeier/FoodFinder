{"text":"People really need to start learning how to review sushi restaurants and how to judge quality maki rolls, as well as sashimi freshness -_-;; I'm sick and tired of walking into these damn highly reviewed businesses with high hopes and dreams only to have them crushed when I receive my less than appetizing platter of rubber and slime.  DON'T DO IT. It may be located in a sublime location, but there is absolutely nothing worthy of its geography. Save yourself the trouble and go eat somewhere worth your while."}
{"text":"After recently moving back to Toronto from Vancouver, my sushi expectations were high. Asuka did not disappoint and in fact, made some of the best sushi I have EVER had! The Green Dragon Roll will change your life.  Exceptionally fresh and perfectly presented, the food was truly outstanding. I couldn't stop \"mmming\" aloud in the same vein as the awesomely obnoxious What About Bob? movie dinner scene.   Great service, and delicious fresh fruit that was the perfect end to the meal. No surprise it's a celeb hotspot and will definitely be a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"Had some beautiful sashimi and very nice, light and crisp tempura at this cute little walk-down basement restaurant on Yorkville Avenue when we visited Toronto.  If I lived in the area I would absolutely be a regular!"}
{"text":"The sushi/sashimi is wonderful here! It's very fresh and authentic! While the restaurant feels very homey and pleasant, the service was anything but that. The hostess was a bit disorganized and gave my group a bit of an attitude as we were being seated. Instead of taking us directly to the table, she instead, 'pointed' at the table we were to sit at. After 5 minutes of sitting, she comes back to our table and yells 'NO, NOT THIS TABLE! I SAID THAT ONE!' wtf?! It was an honest mistake that we mistook the wrong table as ours but I swear both tables looked the same (both seated 6 people!), what difference will it make? After out little incident, we ordered and the waitress brought our food and after that, we never saw her again, except for when she sweetly dropped off our bill. Chef Sato needs to hire a better staff that has people skills!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Good sashimi but I was turned off by some of their rolls  Went last night (Sat), as it was very busy we had to sit at the sushi bar. Very traditional decor. The sashimi I ordered seemed very fresh (yellowtail, scallops, salmon), but my friend and I shared the Sexy Roll and it wasn't great. It actually had too much in it and tasted mushy (shrimp tempura, eel, avocado, maybe salmon?, wrapped in soy paper and topped with a sweet sauce). They offer a few other rice-less rolls which is a cool idea, but I didn't find they looked appetizing.  I'd go back for the sashimi. Overall, it was alright."}
{"text":"Love it. One of the only other good spots in Yorkville (mostly devoid of good food and celebratory of plushed up nonsense), Asuka's incredible sushi (some of which is not written on the menu, I'm talkin' to you \"Red Carpet Special\" and \"Drew Barrymore Handroll\"), the restaurant always delivers solid food and at a pretty good price. Get there before 10, after which they make no attempt at hiding their strong desire to retire for the night..."}
{"text":"The place is a little pricy but definitely worth it. The red carpet roll and sexy roll are sooooo delicious. This will be the place I miss most about Toronto."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi in the city. The quality of fish used is much better than most Japanese restaurants in Toronto, and anything off the Chef's Recommendations menu is excellent.   If nothing else, definitely try the Chef Dynamic Special, it comes to the table on fire (cool) and tastes really good. The Red Carpet roll is nice too, there is no rice, rather it is rolled in tuna (also cool). The Wakame salad is the best I've had, the seaweed is fresh, and the avocado is a nice touch. The gyoza and tempura are pretty standard for a Japanese restaurant, but they are still delicious.   It gets really busy on Friday and Saturday, so I highly recommend calling in advanced for a table. The cost of a meal here is a little more than most casual sushi spots in the city, although the quality of the meal is much higher. Though, compared to other restaurants in the area, this is a 'price-conscious' option. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The sashimi is (usually) really fresh, and the prices are pretty reasonable for Yorkville.  The rolls are decent here--but the real treat are the special rolls like the \"Red Carpet Roll\", etc.  Those are fantastic.  Service is usually pretty good, though when it's busy you have to remind them to refill the tea.  The ambiance is great and this place doesn't come across as one of those cheesy Ikea bento box special places.  This is a great place for a proper sit-down dinner, though reservations are important if you go on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"The main reason I go here is because you get excellent sushi and sashimi and the fact that Sato the chef is a real character who makes up some \"off menu\" items that are delicious. Service can be a little iffy at times but besides that the quality here is what counts."}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves 3 and half stars for sure. I haven't tasted everything but the sushi is better than average quality, it is fresh and tasty. Service is friendly and fast. Asuka is worth the visit."}
{"text":"I came here last wed with group of people. Food was good as usual and service was very attentive and quick. I was highly satisfied  and  everybody in my group was happy with the first asuka expierence. I have no doubt in recommending this place to other people :)"}
{"text":"As far as I'm concerned, there are three spots in Yorkville for sushi: Shogun, Sushi Inn and Asuka. Shogun is the most expensive, and U2 eat there when they are in town. Sushi Inn is like the McDonalds of sushi: it's open late, and all the tourists eat there. Asuka is for the locals. It's almost always packed; at lunch with the business crowd and at dinner with the after work/pre movie crowd and late night with locals and restaurant workers.  Sato is the head chef, and he's been there since I was twelve. He loves baseball, he collects celebrity signed pictures and he jokes with all the customers. Most regulars know him by name and he will remember your favourites after only a couple of visits.  The cuts are clean, the staff are efficient, and it's not short on personality either. it's good for groups, a date, or grabbing a bite alone at the bar.  If you want to see what makes Toronto so diversity rich, Asuka is a great place to start, for both tourists and the newly re-located.  It's not cheap, but its not over the top expensive either."}
{"text":"Something that I'm finding out about Toronto is that you guys have some mad awesome prices on sushi for really good quality fish. How in the world did you get so lucky?! Asuka is no exception here.  The part that really makes this place stand out though is the service. Sato-san (head sushi chef) is hilarious. He busts out lines like Stephen Segal busts out kneecaps. Also, the restaurant is covered with pictures of Sato-san with some famous people. I kind of got some heart palpatations and shortness of breath when I saw that he had one with a pot-bellied and red faced Bill Shatner. Sato-san....I salute you :).  Besides being a delight to sit with, Sato-san is an amazingly solid sushi chef. I loved the touch of tempura crunch hidden beneath my hotate nigiri, and also loved that I got some seriously fat cuts of fish. However, he's got some great talent in making sushi rolls. I just had him roll me up whatever he could think up, to which he responded \"Oh...you definitely want the #1\". Its a great roll...whatever it is. I think the other roll was a dragon roll variant, but it was also quite tasty. Trust the Sato...he knows what is up at this place.  Can't wait till I'm back in Toronto to hit this place up again!"}
{"text":"Despite being situated in swanky Yorkville, this is a good place for a casual sushi night. Even on a weeknight, this place was buzzing. We were a group of 8, and ordered a boat-full of sushi & sashimi (literally a large wooden boat filled with an assortment of sushi and sashimi). It was all fresh, flavourful, and simple. Service was very quick and it was nice to watch the chefs prepare our meal."}
{"text":"Asuka not only provided some of the best sushi I've ever had - it also had a cozy, settled-in atmosphere because of the plethora of photos and memorabilia from all kinds of visitors during its 28 years in business. I speak of all of this in past tense because unfortunately Yorkville's affinity for building condos on every street corner made Asuka a casualty of Toronto's frantic push for development. I cannot believe that after almost 30 years, becoming a neighbourhood staple and part of what made Yorkville such an enjoyable area, Asuka has been forced to close so that this can become an even snobbier part of Toronto. Absolutely idiotic."}
{"text":"Love love love their red carpet roll and green dragon. Highly recommend it for a casual sushi date .........."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday. Great ambience and food is as authentic as it gets. Try the sexy sushi roll."}
{"text":"I would want to love this place, but unfortunately, I cannot find any reason to appreciate it. First, the food is very average. The quality of the fishes is of the same as other lower end sushi places. Second, the service was not good; the staffs were chatting so loud among themselves during the entire time. And lastly, I happened to sit at the bar when the delivery man delivered the goods, while the head chef (the one in the pictures on the wall) signed the document over the fish counter I inadvertently notice his nails. From then on, I can barely swallow his lovely made sushi."}
{"text":"Oh sushi. What would I do without you? This is probably the best sushi restaurant in this area. Sashimis we ordered were so fresh and delicious. Same goes for rolls. No complaints here other than praises. They were tasty.   Service was quick as our foods literally flew out of the kitchen. Nothing is worse than a group of hungry people waiting for food, and this restaruant didn't commit the sin. All of us were fed well, portion was good too.   We thought it was slightly expensive but after all we were happy diners."}
{"text":"Usually I just use Yelp to find interesting places to eat and don't bother to review a restaurant as I don't view myself as a food critique, but this one really annoys me.  - Irresponsible service: the waitress \"forgot\" to bring me the salad and miso soup, no apologize was given.  - Messy washroom.  - Mediocre sushi quality: some of the raw meat sushi does not have wasabi under the meat, the sushi rice tastes like a hundred years old and the maguro tastes like wood.  - Is the itamae supposed to \"taste\" the sushi rice and chewing it in front of the customer to verify it's edible? Gross.  - The default tip rate on their machine was even set at 20%. WOW you guys are really confident about the service, huh?  How sarcastic that my worst dining experience is in an Japanese owned restaurant while the Japanese people are famous for courteous service."}
{"text":"*The 4-star is in consideration of the standards of other Toronto sushi restaurants, but probably a 3 to 3.5 in comparison to all other sushi I've had in my life*  Asuka didn't even know it, but she had a very tough sushi critic and her +1 visit for an important lunch today. A lot was on the line, like my friendship with my +1.  I was a very brave girl in bringing DS to try another Toronto sushi restaurant. I have previously mentioned that I am a huge sushi snob, but DS is an even bigger Vancity snob who had already given up hope on all sushi restaurants in Toronto. I was risking getting a good verbal lashing by DS but thankfully we came out of Asuka with happy smiles and satisfied bellies.  The location is great in the heart of Yorkville, but the decor was terribly drab. Dark (sub-ground level), and filled with those cheesy booth things with rice paper sliding doors that are supposed to make the atmosphere more \"authentic\". Even tackier are the server's \"sexy\" kimonos. WTF? Please do not be led to believe that such things are authentic Japanese. Please. I beg of you.  Aesthetics aside, the menu had a lot of sushi items, which we thought was a good sign. Any restaurant with the confidence to offer a \"Omakase\" or \"Moriawase\" probably has a proud and fresh selection of sashimi to offer.  I ordered the Nigiri Sushi set from the Lunch menu and DS ordered the Chirashi. Both were great! Considering they were the same price, I would recommend the Chirasi over the Sushi set as it definitely had a larger portion and better selection of fish. The fish were fresh and tasty - you could tell by the umami and texture. The sushi had the right type and portion of rice. Tip: A sure sign of a shitty Japanese restaurant is when they give too much rice on your rolls or Nigiri sushi.  I think the fact that my dear friend DS was happy and said would return to Asuka should be reason enough for everyone to pay a visit here. But please don't remove Vancouver or Japan from your travel plans; Toronto is still not comparable.  Atmosphere - 2/5 Service - 4/5 Food - 4/5 Price - 4/5"}
{"text":"I expected more: Better fish, better appetizers... More.  The service here was great-- friendly and prompt, by all three of the ladies working the dining room. However the fish was not blow-me-away good. It was just fine. Nothing was \"wow\". According to my companion, this used to be quite a decent sushi spot. What happened? Even the tea was meh.  My Asahi was nice and cold. whew."}
{"text":"I realized that's Korean owned Japanese restaurant when I saw the menu. It's easy to tell asuka is not a traditional Japanese restaurant. I knew it and I regretted coming in if my fd didn't push me. I ordered sunomono.... I was shock ..."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Toronto!Def great place to grab lunch in the Yorkville area"}
{"text":"I decided to go here upon the reviews of fellow Yelpers here, and after passing by the oft-too-packed-for-comfort Sushi Inn, took the opportunity to try Asuka!  Surprisingly, all of the empty booths were 'Reserved' when we swept in, and it was already 8:00pm. We happily took a seat at the bar, watching the sushi chefs work their magic. The prices are definitely higher than cheapo-depot sushi places, but sometimes, you really pay for what you get. We ordered a sushi boat and a pork katsu type dish to share. Both were very good.  All in all, a decent sushi experience, though a bit more than what I'd like to pay for a regular dinner-out meal, but perhaps that is more a fault of mine than the restaurant's.  And yes, when we left the place at 9:30, the place was packed, and every Reserved booth, claimed."}
{"text":"Good japanese restaurant in Yorkville. Fresh fish. If you are lucky, you find someone famous eating here."}
{"text":"Whenever I have friends from out of town ask me where to go for great sushi in Toronto, I send them to Asuka.  It's small, cozy and usually quite busy; tucked down a flight of stairs you would walk right past and not notice it.  The fish is fresh, the prices are reasonable and the service is nice. I love the hot towels they bring you when you sit down. I usually order a sushi/sashimi boat or loveboat and share with a group. Call ahead of you want one of the private rooms. Seating can be a bit difficult if you have a group larger than 4 people."}
{"text":"The sushi is good enough but the staff are horrible or they were this Sunday. They close at 10pm , we arrived at 9pm and all the waitress wanted to do was close the place. She rushed us before we sat down, which is really annoying. I would do take out maybe but as far as going back, not going to happen. I want to enjoy my meal and not  feel rushed when i have an hour. If you want people out by 9pm , close at 9 not 10."}
{"text":"Sushi was excellent.  Pieces were large and meaty.  The fish was nice and smooth and buttery tasting.  We ordered the sushi boat and they gave us a nice variety of fish and rolls.    There are lots of pictures of celebrities that have eaten there.   This place would have been 5 stars, but the teryaki chicken was dry. The veggies that came with it were very tasty."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic.  Was able to quickly get a table for 3 after we walked in without waiting.  The prices were good and the fare was outstanding as was the service.    We were enjoying the sushi so much we ordered seconds and the waitress suggested we try something 'off-menu.'  She brought us a Sexy Roll and I was definitely happy with it.  It was essentially a Dragon roll but wrapped in a pink rice-like material.  Definitely order it!"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi, tastes great and decent atmosphere. Excellent and friendly service; one of my favorite sushi spots. Don't be fooled by how small it looks from outside."}
{"text":"My Yorkville to-do list goes something like this: - Get an expensive haircut - Buy a grossly overpriced party dress that you will wear maybe once - Play spot the pretentious hottie or not-so-hottie - Eat some tasty sushi at Asuka  This cozy little restaurant is one of my new neighborhood favorites. Reasonably priced. We ordered the Love Boat (sushi and sashimi)  and soft shell crab rolls. Everything was fresh and yummy. Server was friendly, you just have to remember to use the call button. I like the seating in the little private booths. I'll have to go back and try some other rolls."}
{"text":"For all of the hype I heard about this place, I was a bit disappointed. I tried a bunch of everything in order to figure out what I liked best (as I do whenever I try a new sushi place).  Perhaps it was just a one off when I went but the fish wasn't fresh. That really turned me off. The rolls were pretty good though.  The presentation wasn't anything special and I think it's an important detail, just like paying attention to details when you dress. There wasn't a big sake selection either.   The waitresses were kawaii though, which is why I bumped it up to 3*. Decent spot if you're craving sushi and its right there, I guess."}
{"text":"An authentic Japanese restaurant. Slightly pricey, but it is fresh food and really well done by Japanese owners (you won't get disgusting mixes of mayonnaise and chopped leftover salmon bits here).  I like it very much, and would rather come here than Sushi Inn."}
{"text":"The sushi is relatively good and the clientele is charming (Yorkvillian, after all), but it's not the best quality I've had. I am coming fresh from the California sushi scene, so perhaps I'm not being fair, but ideally it is preferable for the fish to be served in solid, well cut pieces rather than mulch. It wasn't bad, but it makes you wonderful about the quality of the proteins they're mixing together. Will I be back? Maybe."}
{"text":"Asuka is always packed. On a monday evening, I couldn't get a table, so was sat at the sushi bar. Well, that's not a problem, but what a treat! The first things I saw coming off the bar were 'off menu' items. Maybe  I'll keep it a secret what all the items were, but I ended up with several of them. You must go and tell Sato what kind of fish you like and he'll create you something you can't get anywhere else. I'd heard this was the kind of place that once you go, nothing else will be the same. Well, it's true!"}
{"text":"Started with the beef tartar, which was really good! didn't get sick or anything  we then ordered a sushi lunch and a sashimi lunch the sushi and sashimi were below average. Salad and rice were dreadful. For a sushi restaurant in Yorkville I was expecting much better!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the city. It's fresh and always delicious. Reservations are recommended for a party larger than two. The food is consistent and has options for non sushi lovers."}
{"text":"Went here on a first date. Not bad. Food was great and service was good. A bit crammed but that's how these places usually are."}
{"text":"Asuka is tucked away under stores on Yorkville Ave in Yorkville. You go down a few steps and enter an authentic-enough looking Japanese restaurant. The staff is very friendly and we were seated quick enough even though it was the peak of lunch hour and the place was packed with suits.  Although it's in Yorkville, I was surprised that the prices are very reasonable (only slightly more than your hole-in-the-wall Queen W sushi joint).  We sat right up at the sushi bar and the chefs, although working at warp speed to meet the orders, were friendly enough to chat.   Word of caution: If you order the beef teriyaki, it comes on a sizzling hot plate with veggies. PLEASE let the veggies cool down for a while. The steak is at the right temperature to eat but I actually burnt my lip with a piece of broccoli."}
{"text":"I love love love this restaurant.  They have these rolls: the red carpet roll, and the yellow carpet roll, that are the best things I've ever had. They are like candy! shrimp tempura and avocado wrapped in tuna and tempura bits. OMG!!!!!  I was there for lunch. My friend and I had: 2 red carpet rolls, 1 yellow carpet roll, seaweed salad, edamame, hamachi sashimi, albacore sashimi and Ika sashimi. The only dish that wasn't amazing was the Ika sashimi.   The service is OK. Not overly friendly, and they forgot to bring us napkins. But the food makes up for all that is lacking in this department.   I highly recommend Asuka."}
{"text":"Good sushi - edamame / dumplings app...salmon / cucumber roll, spicy yellowtail roll, spicy tuna / shrimp tempora / avocado roll, salmon / tempora / avocado roll"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend last night and the food was really good. Our sushi arrived really quickly and it was pretty fresh. One piece of my ginger seemed a bit old but the other 99% of it was good ;)  Our waitress was hard to get a hold of (she forgot to bring us soya sauce) but my friend got up and grabbed a bottle from another table.   If you want good sushi at an affordable price in Yorkville, I highly recommend this restaurant. It's not too fancy but it was busy, which only means one thing. It's good!  The only hard part was getting our waitresses attention to place our order. Once we places our order our food arrived within 10 minutes. Talk about record speeds. :)"}
{"text":"If you're in yorkville and you feel  like having decent sushi/japanese food, I would go to Asuka.   The place is small but you will be accomodated, however the service is hit and miss. Sometimes they're really rude..which kind of throws me off as they have so many \"celebrities\" on their wall of fame, you'd think they'd be good with customers...  Anyways, thank god their food is good. I usually get the chicken teriyaki. They use WHITE chicken meat for that. At other sushi places they use brown meat with fatty chunks which is not very appetizing--at least for me. At the end they give you fresh fruit which is a nice little touch."}
{"text":"This is a pretty great sushi place. I've never really done higher-end sushi (mostly because it's too expensive for students!), but this was a great choice.  My friend and I both got sushi dinner combos ($16-19). First off, the salad was REALLY delicious. The dressing was to die for! The miso soup was good not, and not overly salty.   The sushi was great too. I can see what paying more money for sushi yields. The fish was amazingly fresh, and each piece of sushi was made up of nice big slabs of fish with a bit of rice on the bottom. I think this is the first time I've had sushi where there's significantly more fish than rice!   The service here was just mediocre. Every table was full (on a Monday evening too!) but it took awhile for us to get our bill, and we were in a bit of a rush. Otherwise I'd be willing to give a 5-star rating for this resto! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ate at this Yorkville sushi joint this evening.  We made reservations early, arrived on time and were seated promptly.  However, we waited 15 minutes before we had anything to drink, or were served.  At the point we were finally served we just ordered everything at once.  Pros: great \"ninja roll\" - absolutely delicious.           Cons: too small of an establishment with a busy, pretentious crowd             overcooked teriyaki salmon and chicken             poor, inconsistent service  We are not very likely to go back here to eat at all, unless we go for lunch and only order the sushi or sashimi."}
{"text":"One of the few Sushi places that is actually run by a Japanese person (yes, this doesn't really have a direct relation o the quality of the food, but it feels, and therefore tastes, more authentic.  Not the cheapest, but considering it's on Yorkville (been here for a long time), and the quality of the food, a very fair deal. One of my favourite spots in downtown Toronto for a quick lunch. The fruit really makes it different too.  Service is always good, not excellent, per se, but no complaints. Atmosphere is mainly business."}
{"text":"Good sushi great location. The fish was fresh. Went on a Sunday. They did not have sea urchin. But they normally do. Good sushi. Not the best in the city but I'd go again.  Appears to be Japanese. The pricing is very good. Recommend getting sushi or sashimi because he fish is fresh and the chefs are japenese.  I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"In the area of overpriced and underwhelming food, Asuka is a rare blue fin tuna belly sashimi among a land of white tuna sashimis.   For a very affordable $23, I ordered a Kame salmon dinner- the equivalent of a bento box.    The salad was my favourite part of the meal. Not to say that the other parts of the bento weren't good, but the salad was just...good enough for me to dedicate this paragraph to. When it was first delivered to our table, I was getting ready to take my earrings off and angrily protest how we received the wrong order. It looked too good to be part of our bento. How dare they tease us with delicious looking food that is not part of our bento. Good thing I'm cheap and planned on eating it anyways to take advantage of their incompetence. Even better when I realized they didn't make a mistake it and it was actually part of our meal. Not your typical iceberg lettuce nonsense, this one was filled with pieces of octopus, shrimp, daikon, real seaweed (no bright green trickery) and generous slices of avocado. Delicious and healthy.  To conclude, Asuka is a great choice for Japanese food in Yorkville. An especially great choice if you feel like getting some value back after spending enough money to feed a small village in Zimbabwe for a year on two pairs of heels."}
{"text":"A dank basement sushi place that's definitely past it's prime. The whole restaurant is a shrine to it's former glory, with signed photographs of c-list celebrities lining the walls. I'm sure this place was once one of the best sushi restaurants in Toronto, but the bar has been raised and there's more to compete with than maki mile on Bloor street.   The food isn't great. It's decent enough, though overpriced but it's the service that's guaranteed I'll never be back.   When calling in a take out order, I asked to substitute a different roll in a dinner combo for the california roll. Something I frequently do in my regular orders here - and in other sushi spots in the city - that is always accommodated. I was told that's fine, but that there would be an extra fee. Again, that's common, so I agreed and she quoted it as a reasonable extra $1.   I arrive 20 minutes later to pick up my order and it's not ready. It hasn't even been started because the waitress who took my order is saying she asked the chef, and he said $1 wasn't enough. I say that's fine, and ask how much it will be and she tells me $1.50. I'm annoyed because I have to wait longer and my food hasn't been started, but I'm fine with the extra $0.50 and wait for my order.   The restaurant is busy, so she's with a few other tables before she comes back 10 minutes later telling me this time that the chef has said no again, that the roll I've asked for only comes in a roll of 6 pieces and the combo only comes with 3 pieces. Even more frustrated at the further delay, I ask her to make the substitution in both of the combos I ordered then, at $1.50 each and that solves that problem. She agrees, brings me my bill and I pay for the 2 orders and $3 extra for the upgraded rolls in both.   She comes back 10 minutes later and tells me the chef said no. He won't do the substitution at all. At this point, it's been an hour since I called in, I've already paid, and they're the ones who have been setting the rules on what they'll do that I keep agreeing to but they keep moving the goalpost. After going back and forth to the chef with waitress as the go between, I finally get my order at 9pm, 90 minutes after ordering.   If you're looking for good sushi in Toronto, try Akai on Harbord, Yasu for high end, Hiro for traditional, JaBistro for modern, and Sushi 930 for takeout. All are head and shoulders above in quality with exponentially better service."}
{"text":"Best option for sushi in Yorkville. Typically go on Saturday for one of the lunch specials. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Came here at the recommendation of the nice concierge at the Intercontinental Yorkville - we were in a dire need of Asian food after a few days of deprivation (fish and chips, anyone?).   It wasn't half bad.  Our favorite was the sukiyaki - big shallow iron pot of beef, glass noodles,  cabbage, tofu and sweet sukiyaki sauce.  The beef was plentiful and the sauce was not watery (unlike most places).  Went really well when gobbled down with soaked-up steamed rice.   The rest of the dish was just OK - we had the gyoza (which I wouldn't have been able to tell apart from Costco's Ling Ling brand - yup, the panda - had the two participated in a gyoza blind tasting), salmon sashimi (which, while fresh, was cut too thick) and oyako donburi (which was no Sumika).    But the sukiyaki saved the day.  Or the evening."}
{"text":"It's one of those places that's trying way to hard to accommodate Yorkville. Caught between traditional Japanese and some form of modern  kitch, the waitresses are slow unless your a star or Japanese. Lorn knows what happens when you're both. You probably get your picture on the wall. The foods ok and I wouldn't write home about it. Keep searching in Yorkville and you'll find better."}
{"text":"I have to disagree with the majority of reviews posted here. I really wanted to love this place and went in with high expectations.  My boyfriend and I weren't sure what to order - all of the food looked very tasty as people received their orders promptly. Our waitress was a bit cold, and seemed rushed and slightly impatient right from the beginning. I ignored her bad attitude and remained positive as I was starving.  We settled on an order of assorted tempura, a green dragon roll, two miso soups, two green salads, a medium bottle of hot sake, a spicy salmon roll, and a yam roll to share.  The tempura looked great, not greasy in appearance at all. However when I bit into the dough, it was not crunchy and the batter was largely undercooked. Boo. I love tempura and was so sad with this offering.  My (and the bf's) favourite part of the meal was the green dragon, topped with meltingly tender avocado. The shrimp inside was crispy and delicious. Yay!  Miso soup and green salad, were good and straightforward. Nothing out of the ordinary.  The yam roll was just meh.   My least favourite part of the meal was the spicy salmon. The roll was not spicy at all and the tempura pieces inside were not remotely crunchy. When we pointed this out to our waitress, she frowned and said it was perfect the way it was. She then left until we asked her for the bill. Major bummer.  The small fruit offering at the end was not enough to coax us to ever return. It seems the locals may really enjoy the place, maybe it was an off night but I would never rush back."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars I went here on a Tuesday night with my cousin and the place was really busy. I suggest you make a reservation. It was a super cold night and they offered us one of two tables right at the front by the door. The food was good, the service was kind of non-existent. It took forever to get our drinks and they were never refilled once. I don't even know if she ever came to check on how we were doing. We shared a mixed sushi platter and ordered spicy salmon and deep fried tofu. All of it was delicious. They only gave us one salad and a soup. Shall I take a sip then you take a sip? Thought that was odd, it kind of showed they didn't care. I'm sure if I went to a restaurant in Brampton they would offer two soups without caring, but not here. I liked the food though and it wasn't terribly expensive. I would go back. So cold. Next time I'll sit at the bar if I decide to pop in sans reservation."}
{"text":"Edited down to a 1.5. Sushi not nearly as good this time around and the server questioned my top (which was solid). I don't repeat visits to places like this.   Came here for lunch today as I work in the area - true to reviews, it was filled with suits (including us!). We didn't have a reservation, but the servers were friendly and immediately seated us anyway; by the time we were leaving, there was a line out the door.   Service was friendly, quietly polite and quick, with a smile. The area is cute - quaint, with a mix of attempted authenticity with sexy kimono uniform, paper walls and little private booths and walls covered in autographed celebrity pictures who dined at the restaurant and many framed baseballs.   Sushi itself was quite good - fresh and decently portioned, delicious but not the best I've ever had or expect to. BEST fish/salmon I've ever had - didn't realize it could melt in your mouth like that! Prices were slightly high, but ok for fancy-pants Yorkville. 3 spicy crispy salmon rolls, 1 green dragon and a California roll came to about $43 before tip. They had well priced lunch specials outside the realm of my pescatarian indulgences.   I'll be revisiting :)"}
{"text":"Somewhere between stupid-expensive Shogun and super-cheap Sushi Inn lies Asuka. On my last visit my friends and I split a platter that was a mix of Sushi and Sashimi, which was tasty but a bit weak with respect to the variety of fish we were given. The maki rolls we shared (Unagi, Hamachi, and soft-shell crab) were all really good. For the price, it seems like a very reasonable place to go. It's definitely the place I would pick if I was going to grab sushi in Yorkville, but I don't see it as a place you need to go out of your way to try."}
{"text":"Kind of a 'hole-in-the-wall' feel to this place. Very small waiting area, and very crowded. Ordered a Love Boat with 30 pieces of sashimi, 16 pieces of sushi. Fish was very fresh. Wait staff is very friendly. Can get pricey depending on how you order. Reservations are recommended. Mostly small tables. Not good for large crowds."}
{"text":"Just okay in terms of the food. A perfectly pleasant yet average sushi joint, with a rather small menu and not much to write home about in terms of the decoration.  Service was great! Sue was our server's name, and she was a sweetheart."}
{"text":"Good lunch menu selection. They have bento box from 9.95 to 12.95 which include the soup, salad and fruits. Small restaurant but it was packed during lunch time."}
{"text":"This place is an oldie but forever a goodie. I have been coming here for the past 10 years. I ALWAYS order the red carpet roll & the yellow carpet roll. Even though the space is tight and doesnt have the best floor plan, it really is the best spot in yorkville to eat sushi. Theres a bunch in the area but NOTHING compared to Asuka. Dont get fooled by the weird smell when you walk in. Its Vintage ;) lol trust me when i say this, the sushi here is perfect!"}
{"text":"It's between a 2.5-3 star. I'm undecided. It's partially because I got my food to go and thus may have affected my rating. For one, the menu is standard. It has Korean and Japanese dishes. The sushi roll selection was quite small and unexciting. I found the prices to be average. I got the small sushi boat for $35 and seafood and vegetable tempura for $15. The restaurant itself is on the smaller side with some tables and seating infront of the sushi chef. The atmosphere feels intimate, like a place you can go with your buddy for a drink and a meal.   The rating fell because 1. my sashimi came with no wasabi and 2. they put the hot tempura takeout box on top of the sashimi take out box and did not separate it. I had a 30+ minute drive home and this may have affected the freshness of the fish. The tempura was a huge portion and everything tasted fine, although a bit soggy. Normally restaurants poke a hole in the take out container before putting it into a bag to let the steam come out... Anyways, this probably isn't a fair review but the takeout experience could have been better if they had paid more attention to little details."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the years and tried it again today.   You get what you pay here. Average prices for average food. Had a chirashi and the fish was mediocre with a few unique cuts. Good selection of food.   Service was swift and friendly.   A place I'd pop in occasionally when I have craving or Japanese (run by Koreans) but don't expect much."}
{"text":"This place was a little better years ago, but the last few visits have gotten progressively worse for sure.  Asuka does not serve authentic Japanese and the quality is only ok but I used to come in here for quick lunches for convenience and value. I would never order sashimi here bc i know their quality is not up to par. I only eat simple things that you can't really mess up like makis and their lunch bentos.  I must have never been here on a Sunday bc on my recent visit i found out the lunch specials were not avail on Sunday so we had to pick from their regular menu.  The bf ordered tempura udon which was very meh. The soup was really salty, like a soup mix and the tempura were not crisp. I ordered two sad maki rolls. The rice was really sticky (too wet) and bland, the filling was extremely skimpy. I ordered a spider roll but they didn't even bother to put the legs out. Which is why it's called a spider roll in the first place. I could've done better at loblaws.  The servers were very disengaged. They just want you in and out. They also squeezed us between two other tables when other tables in the back were empty.  With all these authentic Japanese places popping up in Toronto the last few years, I really have no reason to come back ever."}
{"text":"I want to give this place a good rating so badly. My friends love it and it's in a great location. It's been recommended so many times... But to be frank, it's not good.   This tastes like westernized and lazy Asian food. The sushi is sub par and the other dishes really need work.   Do yourself a favour and make a other choice"}
{"text":"Good sushi. If this is the best in Toronto then the Toronto sushi scene is average. The locals rave about the taste and quality, but it is just OK compared to East Coast standards."}
{"text":"After getting shafted on the whole Asuka experience the last time I was out here, I had to take the opportunity to redeem myself.  Alas, I made the walk from the craziness of Queen and Yonge (a good idea to walk it off before and after) and made it to Yorkville in the sleet and got a seat at the bar.  Nice.  Yes, I sat among the autographed pictures of Britney Spears, Megan Fox, Captain Kirk and Jean Chretien as one of the worldly elite who have graced the chairs of Asuka.  I must admit I floundered (no pun intended) between a 4 and 5 but settled on 4.  Prices aren't too bad...  The hand rolls are a deal, actually.  Fish is pretty fresh, and I like (unlike AYCE places) the nigiri rice pads are sized appropriately, and you get more than a laser-thin-cut portion of fish.  One of the better albacore I've had in a while.  But they were out of toro!?! on a Friday night!?! Nooo...  Satosan was there overseeing the two younger gentlemen sushi chefs, and unfortunately the one who made my nigiri didn't pack the rice enough, and almost every piece started to come apart as I picked up it.  :(  The clientele are really pushy...  People just force their way in and sit down without even the afterthought of perhaps the table had a reservation.  This old dude came in and plopped himself at the bar and played dumb when the hostess tried to move him to a single spot.  Maybe he was dumb, but he got the spot right by Satosan and was served by the master himself (although I must admit the roll seemed a little loose and sloppy).  No, definitely had a good meal, got what I wanted without killing myself on rice, and redeemed myself from last time.  Oh, one thing- not wheelchair friendly.  Down a set of steep steps and hard to maneuvre inside.  Domo arigato mister Sato."}
{"text":"Fantastic Yorkville staple. Sato is a legend, still doing his thing in stride. Unless you're offended by dated sports memorabilia or fantastic sushi, you'll like this place.   Menu is simple and well-executed. Fish is always fresh, delicious and generously cut. Everything from miso soup to tempura is excellent. Fresh honeydew and orange with your cheque."}
{"text":"I'm sticking with my 4 star rating for Asuka dinner but need to give it a 5 star for lunch. Walked in Saturday for a quick post-gym bite and it was perfect for the cause.  I'm talking walk in, sit at sushi bar, order lunch special (14 pieces quality sushi, miso soup , salad, and green tea), eat, pay and leave under 20 min and 15 dollars.   I left a happy happy man."}
{"text":"Nestled in richie-richersville, Asuka's clientele the night my buddy and I patronized it was either elbowing their way into getting tables (judging from other reviews, this is not an uncommon phenomenon) or extolling the virtues of giving hefty donations to an Ontario private school to increase admissions chances.    It all felt pretty bizarre, but the common ground everyone in the restaurant shared was, of course, the food, and let's just say it was tasty enough to put off total class warfare for another meal.  The Sexy Roll and Rainbow Roll were fantastic--I love the soy paper as a substitute for seaweed--delicious and generous portions.    I need to return to try their nigiri, but I'm already anticipating the challenge of turning down their rolls.  Just that good."}
{"text":"Decided to walk to Yorkville on Thanksgiving weekend as Asahi sushi was closed and I had a craving that couldn't be ignored.   Was told this place was pretty good, but I must admit that I wasn't overly impressed. You sit down and see all the stars that have eaten here, I guess location plays a major part in traffic.   For two I typically spend about $35 at Asahi Sushi, for similar dishes here it was $55. The portion sizes were substantially smaller and I wouldn't say any fresher than what I've come to expect at other decent places. Overall, not that impressed and wouldn't return. If you are in the area and have an itch that needs to be scratched, this will do the trick, but you might leave thinking you paid a little too much."}
{"text":"After moving furniture and painting all day we were both stiff and sore and needed to go out for a walk so we decided to go to Asuka that I was curious to try . Sadly, the menu was a bit of a disappointment. Not only was there no oshitashi or nasu dengaku on the menu (one of the signs of a Japanese-inspired place) but there were a selection of Korean dishes, never a good sign for a sushi place. The restaurant was cute, a small place settled in the basement of a selection of shops. Everything was really cute and themed along the lines of a traditional Japanese wood-beamed house. The service was pleasant, although a little slow given that there were only a few people in the place and the prices reflected the area. We ordered the seaweed salad, a bowl of chirashi and an order of tempura don. Everything arrived in portions that fit the prices charged and it was all delicious but not in anyway exceptional. It was an enjoyable experience pitched at tourists and Yorkville locals but not really a draw for any other reason."}
{"text":"This was our favourite sushi restaurant back in 2010-2012. We went back this year after not going for 2 years and it was absolutely atrocious. Most of the positive reviews about this restaurant were probably based on how Asuka used to be several years ago. We ordered salmon maki, hamachi maki, taco nigiri sushi, eel nigiri sushi, red snapper nigiri sushi and butterfish nigiri sushi.   The salmon maki had the appearance of mulch. The texture was very mushy and it tasted slimy. The hamachi maki tasted sour. The taco nigiri sushi and eel nigiri sushi were very average. I couldn't even recall eating the red snapper or butterfish nigiri sushi because they were both tasteless. We got some stomach pain after coming back home.  It's very unfortunate that this restaurant went from amazing to utter crap. Almost any sushi restaurant on Bloor would beat this one. The service was also really bad. They didn't refill our tea. They didn't come by to ask how the food was. They were also very impolite when they giggled in the corner of the restaurant, stared at the customers and seemingly gossiped about the customers in their language. Maybe that wasn't what actually happened but we certainly felt that way in the restaurant. It was a very uncomfortable experience."}
{"text":"My favourite Sushi spot in Toronto.  Although its located in Yorkville, pricing can be reasonable depending on how you order.  The head chef, Sato, usually remembers you after a few visits and is always fun to have a quick conversation with.  The only problem is that after ordering rolls here wrapped with soybean skin (instead of seaweed), I can't eat sushi any other way!  Usually its quite busy for a small restaurant, so its good to call ahead or take out."}
