{"text":"Manhattan prices in Mint Hill? They refuse to accept a current coupon they published and the customer paid for?  need to read more?"}
{"text":"Good se selection of wine and beer. The staff seems to be knowledgeable wines. Their food portions are small and pricey but they are quite good. The atmosphere's pleasent. Great place to meet up with friends and have a glad of wine."}
{"text":"Love the food. Atmosphere. Table is cool. Waitress was very nice. Cool bathroom floor. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"This is a great shop. They have a great selection of interesting wines. They have 6 different local drafts that rotate on a regular basis. One great thing is their daily deals. If you want to try new wine come on Monday. If you want to get a bunch of yummy beer come on Wednesday. The food is fairly good... But I don't really see this as a place to eat as much as to drink. I think the menu just needs to be fleshed out a little more. The only thing I would rate a four star is the service. I think it's because I frequent bars with bartenders that have been in the industry for ages... Most of these folks seem fairly new. Either way they are all nice and fun to be around. My wife and I will continue to come for sure!"}
{"text":"Fantastic wine bar in Mint Hill with NC Craft Beer on tap. A local gem!  The bartenders are polite and friendly. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and variety of fresh new drinks available.  A must stop in Mint Hill!"}
{"text":"Vinter's Hill now offers breakfast items such as espresso coffee drinks, croissants and soon sandwiches.  This is a great way to start a morning!"}
{"text":"Staff knows their wine. Very friendly. We were using a groupon and were not scrutinized for it.  Food we had was good. But would love to have more variety. Just can't go and have two or three glasses of wine unless we go on Monday night when it is half price. Champagne taste on a beer budget.  They need more hot food and  better deserts. Good hang out spot if you live in Mint Hill."}
{"text":"Just what Matthews/Mint Hill needed! I love to come here and unwind after work. Great wine selections, small plates, and atmosphere.   They usually have a good crowd so i hope they make it. Only downfall is it may be too pricey for the area. I don't think they do any specials or anything like a lot of restaurants do."}
{"text":"Awesome place to chill and have a drink. Beer is great atmosphere is awesome. Small plates and great appitizers. Place looks nice as well. Come see it!"}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised to find such a little gem in downtown Mint Hill. Food was delicious and well prepared. Staff was able very knowledgeable about their wines. Great selection. Ambience was very relaxed and comfortable. My only criticism is that as a first time patron I was not greeted when I came in and didn't know whether to seat myself or wait to be seated. It took more time than I felt it should have to be attended to and this continued throughout my visit. It was not a very busy time so I can't understand the poor service. I will visit again and hopefully the staff will be more attentive."}
{"text":"I'd love to give them the benefit of the doubt but reviews from five months ago read the same as our experience.   The concept/place is really cute. The entrance is set up really awkward, you kinda feel like you're interrupting a private event or something. There is just bar type open seating but a 'seat yourself' sign or a bartender greeting guests would be nice.   Unfortunately they messed every single thing we ordered up. Yes, every single thing. They apologized profusely, but you need to do more to get people to return, which I can't see doing. We had the groupon which included an app and two entrees. The word app and entrees are misleading since this is a small plates place. A $12 salmon app was four tiny toasts with a tiny piece of salmon. 'Entrees' were equally tiny and expensive. The food was tasty, just way too expensive.   -Somehow our app was mistakenly given to another group so we ended up with having it as dessert.  -we ordered an alcoholic ginger beer and since they were out of that brand, they subbed another ginger beer, one that was non-alcoholic...only telling us after we started drinking it. Which they still charged us for.  -I ordered the $10 wine sampler and was charged $30, apparently because I picked the four wines (which I was told I could do) and the $10 deal was four ones they picked. I did refuse to pay that and they did change to $10.   In summary, our food order and drink orders were all wrong/messed up.   And, being still starved and some $50+ poorer (even with the groupon discount), we ended the night with Arby's..."}
{"text":"Not too bad overall.  Pros: Great local selection of beer Atmosphere Very cool wine tap system with temperature controlled partitions Good food Local community presence   Cons: They use an app style credit card system which seems a bit clunky Only choice if water is tap which has a distinct chlorine taste. You would think that at a place where people pay attention to subtle flavors in their wine and beer they would invest in a water filter or offer bottled water for purchase."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in after work and we will definitely be back! Staff was very knowledgeable and very friendly, we really enjoyed the atmosphere as well. We were very pleased with the food and drink selections."}
{"text":"What a great place to meet friends and relax!  They have the most interesting decor, unique tables and the restroom has a floor made of pennies.  I don't drink wine but the beer I had was super.  Risa is such a friendly and personable bartender/server!  When I make return visits to places it is bc of employees like her.  Nice patio seating also."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and I left with mixed feelings. I ordered the wine flight which is 4 - 3oz wines for $30. I selected my four and received my first pour. Midway through the first glass I was told they had switched out their wines and lucky me 3 of 4 I selected were in that group including the one I was drinking. Seems like a point to share before pouring. A tip: if you order whites like I did, it's cheaper to order 4 - 3oz glasses than do the flight. Your bartender won't tell you this. We ordered the charcuterie plate and it was very good and filling. Priced well. We also ordered the Sweet Heat mix which was to be a mix of honeyed nuts and sesame sticks with Cajun seasonings. Sounds pretty good except we received bland bar mix with no heat and no nuts. Again, I had to ask and it was another switch. \"Still waiting on our regular mix to come in\". Vastly different mix and disappointing that it was served with no explanation. You pay for the mix, it's not gratis like some bars. We tipped well because it's clear the bartender/waiter will need to change careers. We'll give it another go because the concept is good, but will move on if the experience is similar. We do want to support a local business."}
{"text":"I've come here three different times and it truly is a gold mine in Mint Hill. Clean, neat and friendly...always. The girls here work so well together and they really know what they are talking about, I even went into a drawing on one occasion and won a $25 gift card! If you happen to be in Mint Hill come check this place out it's my go to spot here in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"I went to Vintner's for the first time, what a wonderful little place!! I loved Grapes but like this place better. Close to home - Lawyers Road, make a right onto 51, drive down and it's next to the Snap Fitness on the left (really wish they'd let them put up a sign to stand out). The staff is wonderful, interior is very cozy, artwork for sale on the wall - some of it was pretty cool. I had some tapas and can't wait to go back to try others. Very quiet, though it's a Monday. Definitely recommend this place if you love Tapas and good wine (and they have a pretty cool wine menu!) I did the flight or sample wines - I love Merlot and a few Cabs but you can't beat the staff recommended selections. I don't recommend the second cab in the list - Def NOT a fan. The first and third were good and i enjoyed the one merlot they have. Flat bread with fig was amazing, bruschetta was great. I want to try the meats and sandwich, the dessert may be awesome too. Anyway, give it a shot. If you're looking for cheap stay away, if you're looking for quality quiet time and tapas - this is where you want to be. GREAT DATE NIGHT by the way, hint hint guys...I LOVED my fig and arugula flat bread."}
{"text":"Good wine & beer & yes there is food. I couldn't tell anything about food from the website but there is a small menu of flatbread (I had pear & blue cheese which was good), salads. & small plates."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! The atmosphere is pleasant, staff was friendly and accommodating, and the food is really good. I particularly liked the bruschetta with the fig jelly appetizer! I didn't give five stars because it's a little pricey, but I'd go back when I can splurge again."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at Vinter's Hill.  The food was very good, service excellent. The manager was pleasant, she introduced herself and told us a little bit about the restaurant and events that  are coming soon. My husband had the chicken pesto and I had the flat bread. Yummy!  Can't wait to go back again. Oh and they have a sampler dessert to die for. All in all a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Vinter's Hill. My fianc√© and I headed to Mint Hill last night with a Groupon in hand to check out Vinter's Hill for the first time. We had pretty low expectations based off of other Yelp reviews but still felt optimistic. Boy were we wrong.   The service was great. The ladies working were knowledgeable and friendly. The atmosphere is also very relaxing and inviting. That is where the pros end, however.   Vinter's Hill purports to be a tapas style restaurant. I would argue it's more lunch than anything else. Lots of sandwiches, salads, and such. We ordered the pimento cheese appetizer which was good but only because it was from Queen City Pimento Cheese. I ordered the chicken pesto panini for my entree. What was delivered to me was a sub par sandwich with scant ingredients and two rather odd sides that didn't go with my sandwich: mixed greens with balsamic and flaxseed tortilla chips. I can make better food than that at home any day. My fianc√©'s fig and goat cheese flatbread was good but very small.   The worst part though was the wine which was wildly overpriced. $13 for a 6 oz pour when I can buy the bottle for $12.99 at a grocery store?! That's just robbery. We paid $47 for 4 glasses of wine...absolutely absurd. We unfortunately won't be back to this place. We simplcan't afford it and don't want to either."}
{"text":"I love this place. My husband and I go here several times a month. The inside decor is great. It's cozy, but not too cozy and they have a nice outdoor area. minus the road traffic. I like the selection of beer and wine. The prices for wine is a little high. I love that they are active with the community and have different specials each night of the week. The food is excellent as well. I love the flatbread with the jalapeno pimento cheese. Sometimes they can be a little slow with the food service. Several times I've been there when it has been really slow. Also one of the women that work there, she may be a manager, can come off kind of rude sometimes. I don't know if she gets stressed easy or what. But I do love this place and will keep going back."}
{"text":"Although this is known as a super wine bar in the middle of Mint Hill, it is also a perfect place to come for morning coffee and a bite to eat anytime.  I came for lunch with Ginn and had a delicious Cobb salad with a creamy basil dressing.   It came with sliced baguette garlic bread. It was all so yummy.  The service was really efficient and friendly.  The atmosphere was upscale, in a casual kind of way.  The bar was alluring bar and had some artistic table tops.   This is definitely much more than a wine bar and I look forward to returning to try some of the other offerings, perhaps the flat breads next time!"}
{"text":"The shop itself is really nice decor-wise. There's plenty of seating at the bar, which has a great light fixture above it. There's also a long table (one solid slice of tree) to the side. When we went, they were setting up for a painting event, so I imagine that there is usually more standard seating throughout the rest of the shop.   Mint Hill is desperate for a place like this, which is why I had hoped it would be so much better than it was. It certainly wasn't. There are a lot of staffing and management issues to work out before Vintner's Hill is worth a second trip.  When we first came in, we were halfheartedly greeted by employees who were focused on setting up for a painting class. Nobody welcomed us, explained the setup to us, or asked if we had questions. We seated ourselves at the bar and were handed menus. That was about the extent of the customer service.  Right away, my wife got a bad vibe and started hinting about just having one drink there. We had planned on Vintner's Hill being our only stop of the evening and doing the whole shebang there. It ended up being a one-and-done for us.  Six craft beers are on tap, and there's a heavy Charlotte focus (five taps). One tap was from Westbrook, which made everything on tap a Carolina craft beer. For small 12 ounce pours - especially of the standard stuff - the prices are a little much. The bartender that served us knew nothing about craft beers - or what they served on tap in general - and spent a few minutes looking though all of the wines for the Sugar Creek one. Seriously? The glassware selection is terrible as well, especially for a place that emphasizes craft beer with huge window stickers.   The wine tap system is strange. It might have been soap residue on the glass or just a bad pour, but my wife's wine had a frothy head to it that made it really unpalatable.   The entire time we were there, we were served by a new employee, and she was terrible. I chalk that up to management. Who leaves a new employee, who doesn't even know that Sugar Creek is a brewery, how to close a tab, or how to perform other basic tasks, to function completely independently behind the bar? The other regular employees were busy setting up for the painting class. Really? Priorities, people!   Finally, when we received our check, it was messed up. On half-off glass night, we were charged $8 for a glass of wine that was originally $8. I understand the idea of different size pours, but this was never stated on the menu or by the bartender.   Overall, it was not a pleasant experience, and certainly not one that justifies a return visit in the near future. I hope this place is a success, and I will come back once they show some competent management, but I've talked to a lot of people with similar experiences, and the situation looks fairly grim."}
{"text":"More than just a wine bar. We stopped in on a Thursday night for dinner and loved it.   We are not big wine drinkers but did enjoy a beer and very good food. Wonderful staff."}
{"text":"I hate to say anything bad about small businesses especially in a place like Mint Hill where variety in restaurants and entertainment is lacking.....but.....this place left me feeling not fully satisfied.  Pros: I love the concept and decor is very tasteful. They also have a nice patio area. The drink selection is also great. Although staff seems rushed and not really interested in customers, they are still fairly friendly...I may be biased though because I'm used to staff engaging with customers and showing they really care.  Cons: Prices! I get that you're supposed to use the food as something to pick on while enjoying drinks and the drinks are supposed to be the highlight of the meal but portion size is very small. I'm glad I ate before I went!   All in all, it's not a bad place but I just wouldn't go out of my way to visit. I might stop by if I'm passing by."}
{"text":"A group of us went there last night to party and celebrate a birthday. We always brag about this place being so cool, being chilled and just a great place to enjoy friends and listen to music. When we got there, the place was empty, there was no band and the service was horrible. A member of our group came 15 minutes after we got there and no one ever came to get her drink water. I ordered a pimento cheese that rocked this world usually, but the portion was so small that only three of us could eat off of it. The staff was more interested in their friends and their phones and the service was disappointing. To the owners, go back to when you first opened,  back to your place where every table is filled every night, your prices were awesome and your portions were out of this world. Clean house on your staff, And then maybe you'll be back to the hit of Mint Hill."}
{"text":"Service was slow and unfriendly. Patio is too close to the road and suffers from road noise as a result... You're also able to see into the next door gym which is... unsightly. Meat and cheese board was poor... With little meat and low quality cheese the large stale crackers finally convinced me to write a negative review of this place. No notable weekday specials."}
{"text":"This a great little unknown spot.  The owners are very affable and remember who you are.  Great place to unwind from a long day or week.  There is live music on the weekends and the beer and wine selection is excellent."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and very friendly service. Very good selection of wines on \"tap\" and beer selections. The cheese/meat boards are a nice finger good while hanging out."}
{"text":"Amazing wine and amazing people. My experience here has been nothing but wonderful. I would recommend VH to everyone!  Perfect for groups and dates whether it's your first or 110th. Thank you for opening a wine bar in Mint Hill!"}
{"text":"Vintner's Hill is one of my husbands and I favorite establishments! Not only do we enjoy the live music on Friday nights, but the food is delicious and the staff could not be more friendly. They have a variety of small plate dishes, craft beers, wines and coffee that are only the highest quality of ingredients. This is definitely a place to kick back relax on their leather sofa, have a great glass of wine and take in the live music! What a great addition to a Mint Hill!"}
{"text":"Jury is out on this place. Mint Hill needs a good wine bar. They were still painting when we went. Prices a little high. Charcuterie small plate was adequate. We'll see. Hope it gets better in time."}
{"text":"The staff was super nice and they have some great wine choices.  The Chipotle Chicken wrap was pretty good too!"}
{"text":"A really great wine/beer bar in General, and especially to find somewhere in Mint Hill! A much needed touch of class and relaxation in an area mostly populated by heavy fare bars. Great outdoor seating and friendly staff, lots of fun events and a great local beer selection on tap (not to mention a delicious menu) make this a must visit!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate for my friend's birthday back in Feb. '17. The outdoor area is beautiful and has a nice lounge feel to it if you sit near the fire pits. The wine was delicious and salad was good, however I did find it a bit pricey. One glass of wine and a regular Goat Cheese, Apple, & Cranberry salad was more than $20.00, before tip. I will definitely come back, more so for the wine and atmosphere though. Service was good and friendly as well!"}
{"text":"So I just got done reading all the reviews for Vitners and I was shocked to see all the negative reviews... so everyone's expectations are like seriously high!! You're probably that person that complains at anything and nothing will please you. Let me start this off by saying, it's in FREAKING MINT HIll! NAme one place in Mint hill that's classier? Can't name one... okay, thought so... name on place in M.H. that has such a selection of craft beer and wine?? Can't think of one, thought so... Name one place that has a nicer patio?? If u named Dunwells( Chucky Cheeses) you're an idiot... Name one place that offers a food Truck Thursday?? Can't come up with one?? Didn't think so... Name one place that the staff is as friendly... if you don't agree, then you must have come in once and expected 5 star service... My point is, there is nothing in Mint Hill like this place... yes, I agree, the prices for wine and beer are a little high, but that's why u go on special nights.. 3 dollar draft craft beer, 1/2 wine nights... this place is finally bringing well needed sophistication to Mint Hill, it's a great place to enjoy company and not see bar fights.. if u complain about Vitners, well then you're prob not sophisticated and probably cheap and probably a red neck."}
