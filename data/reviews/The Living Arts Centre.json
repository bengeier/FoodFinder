{"text":"I recently went here for a concert and was not impressed.

I'll start with the positive:  sound quality is great, and the staggering of seats in the dress circle is well done, ensuring visibility.  From my vantage point, the floor looked less staggered, but I can't comment on it.

However, several factors affected my experience negatively.  This was my first show attended at the venue, and being transit-reliant, it took time to negotiate how to get to LAC from the bus terminal (their website only provides driving directions and refers you to transit websites to figure out how to get there - lovely).  Once arriving, the first door I was able to see and find was blocked off due to construction, but no signage indicated which way I should circle the venue to find an open door.  It was pouring rain!  Annoyed.

Upon entering, I discover that although the merchandise table provided debit/credit pay options, the concessions were cash only and no ATM was on site.  This is an extreme abnormality these days in venues:  they either offer debit/credit or provide an ATM in the lobby. 

The seating was extremely uncomfortable.  This venue was built in 1994 if I recall correctly; at this point, the overall average size of the population was large than, say, back in the early days of Massey Hall.  The seats should not be built for tiny people, with no shoulder width and short legs.  I had to half-hug myself all night because of the width of the seats, and my arthritic knee spasmed violently from being bent at such a strong angle all night long.  My disabled father could never sit in this venue. 

Last:  the ushers were ridiculous.  Every venue claims no photography or video recording, but most artists and venues accept that fans just want to snap a few photos to remember it by, not sell them for profit.  I personally feel that non-professional cameras without flash should be permitted to snap away if not obstructing the view of other patrons in the venue.  I never noticed, from the dress circle, cameras flashing; I did, however, get repeatedly distracted by an usher waving her flashlight wildly in people's faces, trying to get them to stop taking photos.  It was just that one usher; someone in front of me took photos all night and wasn't stopped.  This same usher chastised people who stood up during the encore for a fast-paced hit song, which is also just silly.  It's a rock show, and it's the end.  Other patrons were standing in another area, left alone to dance.  It was just rude and came off like LAC doesn't want anyone to have any fun whatsoever. 

I personally will never attend another show at the venue, for the reasons above.  It's a shame, because the sound is good, but the way patrons are treated and the uncomfortable \"must be underweight to feel comfortable\" seating that is also ableist is not worth the trouble."}
{"text":"I love the Living Arts Centre, they have spacious rooms and theatres.  I have been both for work and play and I have been blown away by the service and cleaniness of the facilities.  The staff are super helpful and friendly.  The space is open and clean.  You would think that municipal facilities to be dumpy but it is not the case at the LAC.

The underground parking is great, heated and proper signage.  Parking is free after 6pm and on weekends!"}
{"text":"The LAC is a place that's extremely easy to overlook unless you're going there for a certain purpose.

Compared to the monolithic Square One across the street and all the attractions around it (the Coliseum, restaurants, go-karting, the central library, etc.), this almost feels like a bit of a hidden gem. Yet, it is the nexus for essentially every major music performance of note in the city, as well as being a classy and expansive space on its own.

Although I've been going to events, press launches and concerts here for nearly 20 years, it was only this past weekend that I had the unique opportunity to attend two events in both the RBC and Hammerson theatres, and was suitably impressed with the overall attention to quality and making sure the end-user experience is great from top-to-bottom. That's not to say there aren't a few minor quibbles, but this was a standout experience for me.

The first show I attended, \"Louis Jannetta and Memories of the Imperial Room\", was a tribute event held in the RBC Theatre. I was covering it for the paper I work with, and was able to get seats on the lower-balcony section of the theatre. Though the manager said that it was the \"nosebleed\" section, I was actually able to have a better vantage point than some of the guests sitting on the ground floor, as there was a tap-dancing performer whose footwork was much easier to see. This was a cabaret-style seating event, and most of the chairs were set up at tables with small lamps, red cloth covers and candles, which provided an intriguing experience and a fantastic, soulful show.

(On a side note, I also met someone who played a key role in designing the centre, and he told me that a bit of the inspiration for the centre came from the aforementioned Imperial Room, which ran inside the Royal York Hotel.)

The second was a Miss. Symphony Orchestra concert with music from Star Wars, which was held in Hammerson and featured appearances from the 501st Legion (the volunteer Stormtroopers/cosplayers who show up at SW-related events), and was generally a enjoyable show. Barring some sourpuss patrons next to us who didn't clap, this was a rousing show that featured highlights from all eight films (so far) in the mainline series.

If I have any complaints about the experience, I'll echo the seating concerns. They were probably good when they were first built in 1994, but these days, the seats in Hammerson are extremely uncomfortable and had me shifting around constantly. There's no back support for them, and if they do renovations, this should be a priority.

Secondly, the bar is cash-only. I ended up walking across the street to a nearby Second Cup after seeing long lineups for concessions, and there doesn't seem to be any ATM (unless there's one inside Live Restaurant, but I didn't notice that).

Speaking of which, I also stopped in at Live on the Friday night and had a post-concert coffee and dessert. They had several types of cake out on display, and I enjoyed a slice of white-chocolate raspberry cheesecake which may have been the best cake I've tried in the last year. And it was less than $10 for the duo, so there's some good value there if you have a sweet tooth.

I enjoy visiting the LAC and have always made it a destination for premium theatre experiences. While it's not a 100% perfect venue, there's more than enough here to warrant a wholesale recommendation, and it's one of the best theatres in the region."}
{"text":"During my tenure as a yelper, I've had the pleasure of taking in performance arts at each of the various theaters in Peel and York Region. Each has it's own beauty and it's own benefits and notable features, so it's hard to compare one against the other. 

That said, after visiting The Living Arts Centre this past weekend to see a performance for the first time, I was seriously wowed! I've been inside the theatre by day before and it really doesn't do it any justice, by night fall the true beauty of the centre really shines through.

The positive experience begins in the parking garage, a) it's underground with ample spots to support all theaters being full, and b) it's free! What a wonderful combination, Free underground parking. 

I then take the elevator into the main lobby of the Centre and am instantly in the midst of a buzzing crowd that can only be described as a rival to some of Toronto's biggest centers for the performing arts. But the crowd is the least impressive sight to see, the architecture and layout of the lobby is truly amazing, definitely not something you would expect from a municipal performing arts centre.

I believe there are two main stages, I've yet to see the larger of the two, but on Saturday I took in a performance by Ritmo Flamenco in the smaller RBC theatre. This area is extremely versatile as the stadium style seating can be decreased/removed and the floor can be filled with tables and chairs. In addition the seating in the upper levels wraps around the performance area on all sides to you can take in a performance from differing unique perspectives.

Overall a great spot, and one I plan to return to, the next time a show premieres here that tickles my fancy"}
{"text":"I was here for Shen Yun in 2017. It was my first time watching a performance in this venue. I liked it!"}
{"text":"Shows-
I am always pleased with the shows I've seen in Hammerson Hall- their bigger stage.  The sound and view is always clear from whereever I am sitting.  

Last night I saw Glenn Chipkar & The Swing Shift Big Band in RBC Theatre.  Luckily I was able to get tickets to this sold out show.  I found the intimate and lounge-like atmosphere to be highly appropriate for this type of set.  Whereas I have been more familiar with experiencing Classical performances in Hammerson Hall.

Classes- 
I have taken Sunday Adult Ballet and Modern Lyrical Dance for over 20 weeks.  My instructor has been really great and informative at breaking down the mechanisms of the body to ensure proper movement that avoids tension. Which is really important so one can avoid injuries.  My appreciation for Dance has only been increasing since my first enrollment and I can feel an adjustment to the way I move in my everyday routines, my movements are much more stronger and fluid and less rigid.  

Art Exhibits -
I'm always interested in seeing their current art exhibits, but unfortunately the gallery never seems to be open when I am at the Living Art Centre during evening concerts or Sunday morning Ballet Class.  Hopefully they'll be able to open up the hours"}
{"text":"Adult Classes:
I have taken several courses here (eg. cooking, sewing, hot glass, pottery, painting, sculpture, drawing, photography, theater, dance). 
My favorite is their 10-12 weeks hot glass making classes. It's a lot of fun and you'll learn from some very high caliber postgraduate instructors like Heather K. She was awesome and made sure we didn't get hurt handling hot glass. You get to make a different art piece each time!

Dining:
I have also dined at the Living Arts restaurant for brunch. Food was pretty good and service is great. Our meals were prepared by student chefs but you wouldn't know the difference if no one told you. $35pp excluding drinks

Business:
Once we had a business meeting here and my employer booked the place for a day. It was well organized and everything went smoothly. Food was good and staff took great care of us during the full day of meetings and events.

Parking:
It's free when we went and you can easily find your parked car later"}
{"text":"Having visited this place for the first time, I really felt like I live under a rock - the Living Arts Centre gives many downtown spots a run for their money.

The main hall is simply amazing, with great seating and great sound.

The free parking is an absolute win, and the fact that you can take spirits with you, to your seat was a first (and a bit of a shock) for me - I'm used to doing that at a hockey game, but never thought to do so at a theatre performance :)

Really looking forward to visiting it again (and Shaping Sound's \"After the Curtain\" was an amazing show - would love to see it again)."}
{"text":"Drove all the way to Mississauga to watch Shen Yun, just to avoid all the chaos in Downtown Toronto AND to save a chunk of money on tickets and parking. The Living Arts Centre has excellent acoustics comfortable chairs but very little leg room for tall people, especially if someone comes in late and has to step over them. Parking is free after 6pm on Tuesdays, not sure on other days. Friendly ushers and info desk personnel. Theatre is clean and so are the washrooms.

Excellent choice of venue to watch a show, if you're willing to travel a little farther."}
{"text":"I love this venue. It's close to home, lots of great restaurants nearby and underground parking plus several outdoor lots close by.
We saw a show in hammerson hall today. Bought 2 water bottles for just over $6 at the bar and got to take them inside. I went to the patrons line but went in with everyone else as per the usher.
The seats are comfy with lots of leg room. Washrooms on each floor are clean and have several stalls plus hand dryers AND paper towel. 
We sat in orchestra centre in row N and the view was perfect.
There are 2 balconies as well. Stairs and elevators can get you upstairs."}
{"text":"This place is basically a Centre in downtown Mississauga that has different venues for different occasions. A stage with seating is available as well for small concerts or shows. On the first floor there is a restaurant buffet as well.

I come here every week because my church rents out the room for Sunday and Friday service. The rooms are pretty spacious, depending on what you would like it for. Some rooms are bigger than others. 

people usually have their dance recitals here, shows, meetings, etc. 

I like this place because of the little pieces of art and pictures of people all over the place. it also has free underground parking which is also heated in the winter, which is awesome!"}
{"text":"3.5*, but pumped up 'cause I'm biased.  How do you give the \"hub\" of arts in your city a negative review??

As a life-long resident of Mississauga, I have been to LAC about 3 times:  a bridal shower at LIVE Restaurant (nice atmosphere, galleria wall, high ceilings), a production of \"Bye Bye Birdie\", & tonight's presentation of Mississauga Festival Choir's \"Jingle Jazz\".

In comparison to Richmond Hill Centre for the Performing Arts, Mississauga's version pales in comparison.  After all, it is older and smaller.  However, LAC does have underground parking, free after 6pm.  I'm not sure if RH has underground, but RH's parking is free 'til midnight!

The concert I saw tonight was in the smaller, RBC Theatre, approx. 340+ seats.  The theatre is rectangular, so the \"best seats of the house\" are near the front in the centre.  The absolute worst seats are on the 2nd level, flocking the stage OR directly behind the stage.  On either side, you will only see the barrier and have to literally crouch forward, head over the railing to see any action.

On the other hand, Hammerson Hall, the larger theatre, has a better layout.  The seats descend towards the stage and radiates, focussing on the stage.  So there are more better seats as opposed to when the seats are just places in straight rows.

So your experience will definitely depend on what specific theatre your show will be at.  You'll definitely have a more enjoyable experience if the performance you're seeing is at Hammerson Hall!

Note:  I was stopped by an usher for taking a photo with my crappy cell phone cam.  I read the brochure which stated that photos are prohibited which I think is kinda dumb, especially if you're using a unprofessional camera which will not disturb the performers."}
{"text":"I came here for Shen Yun.  It's about $10 cheaper than going to see them in Toronto. But the venue is smaller than Toronto, so you get better value.

 However the seats are very uncomfortable and I was very uncomfortable most of the time. They need to update the seats in there.

I'm not sure why but parking was free on a weeknight.

I would recommend this place for a performance."}
{"text":"4.5 stars... bumping it up after seeing Nikki Yanofsky and comparing this to another GTA arts centre.

I recently sat in the Hammerson theatre for a great event and I realize that I never wrote a review for this place!  My last visit was in the RBC theatre for an actual wedding reception and that was years ago!  

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience here  ... clean, open, and with good seating for a fair price, I laughed and giggled my way through a performance that easily compares to any in downtown Toronto.   This wasn't your high school art performance... LAC brought a top tier act and I think it was sold out (deservingly). How often do you get to laugh at a living giraffe (aka Ryan Stiles) on stage with a cub? Another great point about this is how easy it is for parking... just underground and its free!  I remember spending at least $20 for parking when i go to Sony or anywhere in Toronto.  

For concerts, I have to say the acoustics and sound was very nice... definitely clear and nothing that makes you wonder 'who the hell is back there messing with the sound'.  I saw Nikki Yanofsky and it was easy to see everything from me seat.  For the price, it is a smidge cheaper than places in Toronto but when you factor in a nice ride in, free parking, lots of people to help manage the crowd, and a usually a short trek back home (for those who live in GTA)... it is worth it.

I also have to say that the maintenance of the facility is really good here.  I recently went to an event for the Richmond Hill one and I was just ... shocked at the state of the women's washroom.  I think a kitten has shredded less toilet tissue and left them scattered everywhere.  When I went to the Nikki Yanofsky concert, everything was pristine, clean, and I saw at least two staff in the bathroom cleaning.  So YAY LAC!  

I dont come to LAC very often as most of it's acts do not grab my interest but if you do see a performance that is interesting, don't hesistate!  I would say the LAC is a great venue and the Hammerson hall is just as good as the ones I've experienced in Sony (ok... much smaller) but I dont think there was a particularly bad spot at all."}
{"text":"Nice arts center with a great restaurant and lots of interesting workshops. Fine dinning but at a lower cost."}
{"text":"Nice theatre.  They get a lot of grest acts, singers, comedians, etc.  Good sound.  Comfortable seating.  All rows are raised, so no one's head is going to block your line of site!  Which is awesome.  Don't eat at the restaurant, it's dreadful!"}
