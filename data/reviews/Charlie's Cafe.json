{"text":"I am honesty shocked by all the low ratings. The coffee here is fantastic! Everything from black coffee to caramel macchiatos is amazing and way better quality than Starbucks. I have had a few things like breakfast sandwiches and spinach and feta croissants and I would definitely buy them again. You usually have to wait in line and their computer system is pretty slow, but it's worth it for a good cup of coffee. I'd easily pay an extra dollar for a caramel macchiato that is ten times better than other places."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviewers regarding the coffee.  But - also why must people buying a bottle of water wait so long? The barista should be making quick sales before making a full meal or latte for another customer....or get another barista to run the register.  Its annoying that you have to wait in a really long line just to buy a bottle of water."}
{"text":"I don't drink coffee so I can't speak to their particular cup of joe.  However, I've eaten their twice: Once for a sandwich and one a muffin.  The sandwich was subpar.  The muffin was pretty good.  White chocolate something-or-other.    It's not that Charlie's has personally offended me or anything - it's just that I would prefer almost any other restaurant in existence to inhabit that spot instead of Charlie's.  If I'm forced to grab a snack in the law building, Charlie's is it.  The vending machines never take my debit card (idk why) so I'm forced to eat an overpriced, ok muffin.  It's unfortunate.  At any given restaurant I can at least find one item that's not too expensive that I like.  Not Charlie's.  It's an anomaly."}
{"text":"Sandwiches and pastries are fine grab-and-go food, but the food is completely over-priced. Of course, convenience will drive up prices but its gotten a little ridiculous.  Despite these semi-high prices, the service completely ruins any positive attributes of the cafe. My first year at the law school (2012-2013), the baristas were excellent, providing efficient and quality service. Obviously, Charlie's just lucked out with the two main baristas during that year. Its apparent that they have not even attempted to adequately train their workers or adequately staff this cafe with enough workers to handle the demand. This leads to high wait times, terrible service, and \"hangry\" (ahem, administration that means hungry plus angry) law students.   Needs improvement pronto!"}
{"text":"O Charlie's. I keep going to you out of convenience but I keep being consistently disappointed. The female workers are lovely people with whom I enjoy chatting. But the service is completely terrible. Only one person working at 3 p.m.? I have counted 15 people in line at one time. I think most businesses would recognize this as a problem and act to fix it! Not Charlie's....  Additionally, burnt coffee, burnt espresso, burnt milk! If the coffee and food were on par with the high prices, it might be okay. However it's the whole combination of bad food, bad service, and TERRIBLE COFFEE that makes me frustrated with this coffee place."}
{"text":"Update: I mean, they have tried to improve. People say their coffee has gotten a little better. We were also very harsh on them when we first started the yelp. I'll award them an additional star but it is mostly out of pity.    Original review:  The customer service here is not that bad. The coffee on the other hand is lacking in quality. Actually, it's some of the worst coffee I've ever had. Some of the sandwich options are tolerable , but it's a coffee shop... and the coffee is awful. Also,  there is a fee to use your card if under 5 dollars. Pfft"}
{"text":"This place is on par with airport restaurants. They know you can't really go anywhere else so there is no hurry to serve you and the food doesn't have to be affordable because you only eat there when you really have to. Consequently, I only eat here when I really have to."}
{"text":"Tried for my forth time and it will be my last! All the coffee and lattes are horrible, food sucks, customer service sucks.....not pleased!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The food and drinks are incredible and on top of that, I really don't think I've ever met anyone nicer than the staff. I always go to the one in ASU's design building and I've never ever once had a bad experience. I'm in college, and tight on cash, and the employees always help me pick the best drinks that are inexpensive. Amazing, every employee here definitely deserves a raise!!"}
{"text":"There is currently an ad up showing a Pizza Hut 1.2 miles away from this caf√©. I could probably stroll there and back in less time than it would take me to get through a three person line at Charlie's. In addition, I'm convinced that Pizza Hut's coffee is superior to Charlie's (and I don't think Pizza Hut serves coffee)."}
{"text":"The muffin I got was stale and tough but they did give me a refund when I went back. Too bad because for that price it should be fresh."}
{"text":"This goes for both locations, but especially the library one. The business structure needs to be worked out. I suspect the owners are cutting costs every place they can, but it hurts the business. Just a little strategically placed competition, and you're toast. As of now, the Starbucks in MU and the Starbucks buggy are too far to hurt business. But if one opens next door or just outside, you're done. But the issue is that you can fix your business easily.  1) Update card swiper to not need signatures 2) Update and maintain pre-prepared food selection. Random salads and curry and rice are inadequate, they get old, and folks don't want them. 3) I've been there with huge lines where you have one person both taking orders and making coffee and another filling the case with muffins or making sandwiches for cases (not for orders). Do that stuff before you open. Streamline service so it's faster. I've walked out a ton of times because it takes too long. The lines mean you get the business. But they also mean people will bail on you if a better option is just outside. 4) Improve your coffee and iced coffee."}
{"text":"The manager of this facility, Joseph Bryan Rollins should not be working here. He was recently fired from another cafe for a multitude of reasons. He told me that the only reason he works at Charlie's Cafe is so that he can \"take advantage of ASU girls\" only he didn't use the word \"girls\" and rather a word that starts with a \"B\". He also stole an irreplaceable music collection given to my wife from her best friend who died of cancer. This man is a predator and human garbage, he should not be in close proximity to young women. I could go on forever but I won't."}
