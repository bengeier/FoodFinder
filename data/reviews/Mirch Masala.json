{"text":"Very clean! Buffet looked great, especially since the buffet closed in 10 mins from when I got there. They didn't have old dishes just sitting.  I ordered off the menu. Veggie masala and samosas. Both were great! Samosas were nice and crispy and the filling was delicious. I eat a lot of Samosas, and these are in the top 3! The curry was well flavored and veggies were fresh!  I was very happy I stopped here."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant to have on state street! I called and ordered a half vegetarian dinner for two for take out (which is not on the menu but asked and they were very helpful and said they could do that for me!). The restaurant looked very clean and well kept when I was there, not many people at 2:30 pm on sunday, but the buffet looked very tempting! I usually like to order from the straight from the kitchen but it looks like I will have to come back and try the buffet. When the food came out i was surprised by how big the bag was! After getting a look at the buffet then getting a big bag of goods straight from the kitchen, i was pretty excited. Three vegetarian entrees, rice,naan,kheer, chutneys, vegetable pakora and a soda for 20$ with tax! The food ingredients seems to be of good quality as well not only that but they are prepared very well. The sauces don't taste cheap or off like they have at other places i have tried, the rice was fluffy and just right, I had just the regular naan and it was great! I'm sure the more interesting naans are even better. The kheer is really top notch as well! taste better than most i've tried. If you're in the mood for indian food downtown this place should certainly be on the top of your list to check out."}
{"text":"Well, the food SMELLED good.  However, upon being seated, we received two pieces of news that precipitated a rapid exit: 1) they were no longer honoring the coupons we had purchased--that prompted us to visit Mirch in the first place--because 2) they were closing in two days.  Buh-bye."}
{"text":"On a Sunday evening my husband and I decided to go to Masala Mirch without having a look at the reviews. So when we reached there and went inside, the waiter came to get the order from us. He did not even have the list taking pad, then we went ahead and gave our order. He kept on repeating the order again and again. Then to our surprise he was the only one(apart from his wife) to take the orders, cook and to serve. First we ordered schezwan prawns and naan. What he cooked and served was just ridiculous! The prawns were floating in such a red liquidy gravy which tasted like nothing but absolute chili. Then came our chicken fried rice and garlic chili chicken fried rice. I couldn't spot any taste difference in between the two dishes. Lastly, we also ordered chicken corn soup which he actually forgot to bring and we were very thankful for that! On the whole this restaurant is a disaster, please DO NOT waste your precious dollars here!!! I wish I could forget the visit to this restaurant and never recall this incident again!"}
{"text":"I anticipated that the restaurant would be busy so I got there early, I was lucky to get a table.  I waited for my bf when he came we got in line. The cash register was at the grunt of the line. It took the cashier a few minutes to tell us to go ahead and get started. I grabbed a plate (which was soaking wet) and proceeded to get food from the very empty buffet. So, we gave our plates back to the cashier and told her we were leaving because there was no food...she didn't even apologize. Won't even bother to attempt to try that place again."}
{"text":"The chow mein is very similar to what you find in India, but there's not many options for vegetarians overall. For vegetarians, it's a pretty decent Indian place and now that it has moved to State STreet, it's much more accessible."}
{"text":"Big fan of their buffet. Lunch buffet is 9.99 plus tax for variety of Indian food , desserts and fresh salad and fruits.  The Service is really good , the owner's wife I guess , she always has smiles on her face and really friendly.   The Price is decent for variety of choices.  The Food is good : My favorite are butter chicken and some yummy curry beef and their fruit rice.  Totally recommend for someone want to try different kinds of Indian food before they order dishes for dinner."}
{"text":"Honestly they have of the best Chicken Tikka Masala's in Madison! I'll be coming back for more."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The food is amazing and the service is incredible! Would recommend this place to everybody"}
{"text":"Eh.  All I can say. And to think I looked across the street and anticipated this for months.   I came in, asking if there was any take out, and all I got was a flyer with their number on it. Did you even listen to me?  Food was just ok. Chili chicken was great. I enjoyed that. I agree the naan was doughy, but still had good flavor.   The bones in the chicken could cut your mouth if you were not paying attention.  Rice with the chicken in it (forget the name for it), had a weird taste to it. I just couldn't put my finger on, but it was cold.  Most of the buffet was empty and I was scraping the pan or waiting for more to come out with most of the selections.  Overall, was decent, but I don't think I'm coming back at that price. Not worth it at 10 a head when I didn't think it was good enough to warrant seconds."}
{"text":"There are a lot of mixed reviews of this restaurant.  My husband had his reservations. He said everytime he passed it downtown,  it just looked dirty on the outside. He said from its appearance,  it looked as though flies would be buzzing all around the establishment, and that the food would be disgusting.  He sort of lowered my expectations and anxiety about going, but we went anyway because I didn't want to waste my Groupon.   Once inside, we were humbled by the cleanliness of the place, and the amazing aroma of spicy food in the air. We began making our plates. We did the $9.99 lunch buffet from 11@-3pm.  I got a little of everything. The waitress was nice and she brought us plenty of naan. We liked the food. This was our first Indian cuisine experience,  so our palates aren't privy to the way that certain dishes are supposed to taste, still we enjoyed it. We both left out full, and very satisfied.   I don't know if it's a custom, but our waitress gave us water with no ice, and according to my hubbie, wasn't exactly personable. Yet, we both said we would go back again."}
{"text":"Ordered Lamb Masala and got a dish that had a few pieces of boneless lamb in \"butter chicken\" sauce. Probably the worst Indian restaurant in Madison."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, everything else lacked.  Cold and dated atmosphere.  Awkward service.  No Kingfisher or any other beer.  Get takeout. Get shrimp biryani."}
{"text":"I ordered the vegetable curry, and though it tasted good, it was really greasy. My friend got the chicken madras, and there were literally 6 pieces of chicken in a soupy sauce. Not worth what we paid- Maharani is way better."}
{"text":"The ability to sit on the square was really nice with a great view of the square.  The food was solid but not the best Indian I have had in Madison.  Garlic Naan was a bit flat and the dishes were not terribly aromatic or bursting with flavor.  I would come back for sure as it is a nice experience.  Perhaps it was a one off night.  I enjoyed myself and will return at some point."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner, they had amazing chicken tikka masala and gulab jamun. My friend choked, completely his fault, and they offered to give him anything on the menu thinking he was upset. Such amazing service and a great family owned restaurant ! Will be back again very soon :)"}
{"text":"Everyone has to have a go to Indian buffet in the city and this is mine! Being on Public Square catch up on your Bollywood movies and watch the hustle and bustle of the city. You won't leave hungry"}
{"text":"Good service, good food. Got the 3-meats curry combo, the butter chicken was a bit on the creamy side, but the beef and lamb curry were well prepared. There was a hint of herbal flavor in the beef curry, which was unique. A lot of my colleagues from India come here, thus, the place is not westernized. If you like Indian food, you will not be disappointed.  Update: I crave for Mirch Masala everyday."}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian dishes and excellent service.  I was only two nights in Brampton but enjoyed it so much the first night I came back for the second night.  It was excellent Indian cuisine prepared with spicy but not overly hot sauces.  I would say if you're a strict low fat vegan you should ask for the dishes to be made \"low oil\" since by default they are fairly heavy.  Also many of the vegi dishes have paneer cheese as an ingredient so you may ask them to make it without paneer.  However the chef is excellent and all dishes can be made to your desires.  I did not try any of the meat dishes but I am sure the tandoori dishes must be quite good.  I tried the vegetarian Jaipui and it was really excellent. The Aloo Tikki Chat appetizer was excellent with the chick pea sauce being spicy and delicious.  The next night I had the Chana Bhatura appetizer which although fried was done just right.  The outside was delicately crisp and the inside just the right texture with amazing flavors.  I had the Navraton Korma which was much milder in flavor but still very tasty.  Next time back I'll have to try the dahl dishes.   They hve a decent beer and wine selection and the prices are OK."}
{"text":"Me and my wife  visited Mirch Masala for the first time yesterday . We ordered chicken vindaloo , it was out of this world . . Ambience was beautiful, very clean and service with a smile are the things which will take me back to this amazing place."}
{"text":"This was my first real Indian food experience, and now I'm addicted. The food is fantastic, definitely recommend the chicken tandoori! It's got a great location, great staff, and I think it's family owned. We'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Their lunch buffet is highly recommended.  The selection is smaller than Maharani, but every dish is excellent.  This is, by far, the best restaurant I've been to in Madison.  In terms of flavor and quality, there is absolutely no comparison between Mirch Masala and Maharani.  Chicken and meat are tender at Masala, and every dish has the depth of flavor.  Their vegetarian curry was absolutely gorgeous.  Their lunch buffet also include an excellent tofu dish."}
{"text":"We were very happy with the quality of the dishes and it satisfied our taste for Indian food. The Beef Vindaloo was spicy and flavorful, the biryani fluffy, and all the sides were yummy. They offered mango ice cream for dessert, along with pudding and some hot items, very good. Great price, well worth the stop :)"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place because we had a Groupon. Upon walking in, I thought we had made a mistake. The restaurant feels like an Asian take out joint with a loud tv in one corner and a lack of updated decor. We sat ourselves at a small table in the corner and were brought glasses of water that seemed to be right out of the tap with no ice. The man serving our water left dirty fingerprints on our glasses and delivered unwrapped straws to our tabletop with his bare hands. Not a good start. I was questioning the cleanliness of the restaurant based on the water delivery and the general state of the dining room. Putting all this aside, we decided to order.   We started with the appetizer wings, which were delicious! Served with a bbq type sauce with peppers and onion, they were meaty and juicy.   I ordered the Achari chicken, mostly randomly, and was very happy with my decision! The dish was flavorful with a peppery sauce. My boyfriend ordered the chicken tikka masala, a classic. It was slightly sweet with a buttery tomatoey sauce. Very good.   We also got an order of the plain naan. It came out warm and slightly crispy on the outside and was the perfect vessel for scooping up all the delicious sauce from our chicken entrees.   Overall, I would go again, but I do wish they would clean things up a bit for my peace of mind in their quality! The 3 stars is purely for the cleanliness factor. Otherwise, the food is a 4 for me."}
{"text":"Simply delicious. Stopped in for the lunch buffet and had the Tikka Masala, Spinach Chana and Chicken Biryani. Everything was fantastic."}
{"text":"Food is fine, service was extremely slow, almost two hours. Hardly anyone was there, they were just understaffed. Maybe the lunch buffet is better"}
{"text":"We had the buffet on a Saturday night ($15 per person; served Friday and Saturday nights only).  The server kindly offered to bring out more fresh naan, even though we were the last to arrive for the night.  While I can't honestly say that everything in the buffet was a home run (for example, some of the veg offerings had flavors that were a bit muted and \"home-style\" for my liking), the butter chicken alone is probably worth the price.  Probably one of the best butter chicken preparations around.  As well, the rasmalai and kheer were both really good, especially the rasmalai."}
{"text":"We ordered the Lamb Biryani, Beef Saab, Lamb Masala for dinner.  All were delicious! Service was attentive, and the restaurant was conveniently located in the Capitol Square. Nice, cozy atmosphere. I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Naan is as fresh made as it gets. Hand made!! With a dish of butter chicken... its to die for!!! This place is far from us but totally worth it!! The owner and his wife run the place and they are always a pleasure"}
{"text":"Mirch Masala has a new location in Pineridge, and I believe they are licensed now. Same great food, just a bigger location! Go already if you haven't. :)"}
{"text":"We went there on a Sunday evening and throughout our time there we were the only guests. I am well acquainted with the Indian cuisine and the food there was below average. Lachcha paranthas were well made but other than that everything else was a put down. The biriyani they served was no where near the authentic stuff that we were expecting. Overall, it was a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 or 5 times, always for the lunch buffet. The first time was right after it opened, and the food was good, but a little watery. Every time since, it's been a slam dunk, best Indian buffet I've ever been to, better than Charka (RIP), better than India Garden, etc.  What makes it so good is that the buffet food is actually spiced like it ought to be, unlike most Indian buffets. I've never tried a meat option there, but ever vegetarian thing I've had there has been great.  They've had many different options for vegetarians each time I've been. My usual favorite of Palak Paneer is very good. They always have fresh naan available too.   Yeah, service is a little weird, but who cares. It's an Indian buffet with awesome food."}
{"text":"What this place lacks in ambiance it makes up for in food. Tasty, savory, exotic and free-flowing food.  We stopped in here for the lunch buffet and were pleasantly surprised. It's tucked into a nondescript location on the second floor of a strip mall. There are simple tables and not much going on, other than a nice little buffet. The food is great here, and the value is incredible. Two of us ate like kings for $20, and were very satisfied."}
{"text":"Delightful food, great service. My wife and I just enjoyed some excellent late-night take-out from Mirch Masala. We stopped in to order their \"non-vegetarian dinner for two\" to go. We were in a hurry because our date night was at an end and we had to pickup our kids at a certain time.  The staff at the bar were welcoming. We ordered our food - which they customized to our spice preference, medium in our case - and then shared a glass of wine at their bar while we waited. It was cozy, the music was appropriate and not too loud dirt didn't interfere with our ability to talk. We regretted not being able to stay longer to enjoy the atmosphere.  Our food was ready very quickly which we appreciated and packaged extremely well. There were lots of sauces included with our meal and they survived the ride home perfectly.  Even after thirty minutes in the car, the food was hot and smelled delicious. It tasted even better! Two saucy dishes (one chicken, one lamb), a huge serving of steamed rice, seasoned chicken and other ethnic treats awaited us. My wife and I were thrilled with the entire meal  - every dish was different and flavorful.  We were extremely pleased with Mirch Masala and are already looking forward to returning so we can enjoy their outdoor seating the next time we're hungry for good Indian food."}
{"text":"Good Food and great service. Good ambience for dining in. Owners take great pride in customer service. My favorite dishes here are the fish pakoras, Keema naan, butter chicken and beef curry."}
{"text":"Mirch has a great student lunch buffet with a pretty decent variety of foods (including the classics such as chicken tikka masala) at a good price (and student discount)!!!  My main caveat with this place is that the food is toned down compared to other Indian food that I've eaten.  I'm not sure if this is to cater to the diverse student body, but for more flavor and/or spice, there are better Indian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it a 2.5.  Nice place. Clean and well kept.  Smelled great when I walked through the door.  Service was excellent as I got a table right away and was shown the buffet.  Seemed to be plenty of food.  I'd give the naan bread at least a 4, very good.  But the rest of the food was well boring.  I didn't get all the nuances of flavor that I expect from Indian food.  It was like a mid-west meat and potatoes style Indian food.  I want to get a POW sensation when I eat vindaloo (it's vindaloo, its supposed to be HOT) but nothing.  So if your palette runs to mild food this is the place.  If the great use of spices is what you want in Indian food, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I used to eat at a nice little Indian place on W 9th, but that closed and I needed my fix. I have eaten here twice now...the first visit was decent, but bit disappointed with my last. I like a vindaloo, and I went with the chicken. I would like it a bit hotter, but would say the biggest complaint was the high amount of bones in my dish. I am ok with some, but this was just too much.  I have also tried the lamb, and think that was decent as well...could use more heat tho.  Not sure I will visit again...definitely had better in / around Cleveland."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Cleveland and decided to give Mirch Masala a try.  I had read other reviews, so was a little skeptical, but in the end, I'm glad I tried it out.  Did not go for the buffet, but ordered take out instead.  I got their Chicken Tikka and Saag Panner.  Both were very tasty and the chicken was cooked to perfection. It was still very moist without being undercooked.  The naan could have been a bit larger, as they were small compared to other Indian restaurants.    I did not place the order ahead of time, therefore it took about 30 minutes for them to prepare the food (Good to know they were actually making it fresh and not rewarming it). As I waited they brought out an appetizer portion of papadam for me to try. Although it was cold and seemed as if it had been sitting out for a while, it still hit the spot. Not many places will bring you out an appetizer while you are waiting for your food to be cooked.    I would definitely try Mirch Masala again.  If you're ordering take out, I recommend placing the order ahead of time as it does take a little bit for them to prepare the food."}
{"text":"Good Indian food is strongly seasoned and spiced leaving no room for \"Wisconsin seasoned and spiced\" - which translates into not spicy at all and usually plain on flavor. Mirch Masala plays right into the Wisconsin palette. Service was very slow, but our waiter was so kind."}
{"text":"Good service. Good food great people. Highly reccommended. Come here and enjoy ur lunch. Owner actually came himself after we dome eating to check if everything was ok. Good thing is owner is also head cheaf."}
{"text":"I've gone for the lunch buffet, for dinner, and gotten it for delivery and I have always been impressed by the flavor of the food! Usually, it's a wife and husband running the place and they do a great job of keeping the buffet stocked and have always been friendly enough to me.   My friend always gets the shrimp masala, which is chock full of shrimp and totally delicious. I really like their chicken curry but I also enjoy their chicken biryani and the vegetable curry. The spice does run rather hot - medium for me is always the perfect amount of spiciness and sometimes even too spicy so plan accordingly! The samosas are yummy and worth getting as well. The prices are a little bit expensive but I think they're still reasonable considering the probably high price of rent being on (or so close to) State. I still probably do like the Amber Indian buffet better but since this place is so much closer, it's become my go-to Indian place."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is a great bargain for all the delicious Indian food that you can get.  The chicken tandori is excellent, along with the aloo naan when they have it on the buffet.  The mango ice cream is a nice dessert.  It's also a bit off the beaten path on State Street where it's easy to find a table without a wait during the school year."}
{"text":"Different kind of place.  Made the mistake of sitting under the tv in the corner.  I regrettably realized that it was cranked up blaring an Indian soap opera.  So, the half dozen customers who don't speak Indian and the 2 employees who do were mesmerized by the high pitched wailing that seemed to never end.  Besides that, food was just ok.  They refreshed the buffet line during commercials.  If I ever become addicted to East Indian soaps this will get another star."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be on the capitol square but moved a few blocks down a state street two years ago. No wait for a table on a summer Saturday evening, and the menu has several dozen entrees; I had a lamb and vegetable dish (the waiter asks you to rate your spiciness preference on a scale from 1-5; I went with 4 and it wasn't reach-for-my-drink-after-every-bite overwhelming) and my companion went with chicken curry. Portions were a little above average in terms of quantity, the lamb was tender, as was the chicken. The drink selection was good (beer, wine, etc) and the service friendly. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and service. Love the buffet on Fridays. Never that busy, so getting a table is as easy as walking in. Staff is friendly. Been here 5-6 times, and its always been good."}
{"text":"11 filtered reviews (as of this review) should be all most experienced Yelpers need to know to stay away from Mirch Masala.  Excited to try a new restaurant so close to the action, we did a take-out order and were very disapointed by both the portions, quality and overall taste of the food. The chicken was very bland and somewhat burned.  To top off our very poor experience, service was very slow. I hope management can turn the restaurant around quickly or I'm afraid they will not last very long in the highly competitive downtown dining scene."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. My other favourite is the host downtown Toronto....this restaurant is my new spot in Brampton."}
{"text":"Best Indian Food in the NE aways worth the wait ALWAYS FRESH!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Mirch Masala twice, and have gotten take out once. My experiences at the restaurant were okay. The service, as many other reviewers have mentioned, is pretty terrible. My group of 5 waited for 30 minutes for our appetizers after we ordered, and another 45 after that for our meals. But the food was decent and I was with friends, so it was fine.  But yesterday at around 6:30pm, I decided to stay in and order take out. I called three times before anyone picked up, and asked if I could place an order for delivery. The woman on the other end of the phone was nice, but confused, and said that the delivery man would call me back to make sure he could deliver to my apartment... even though I live 3 blocks away. I waited, and a few minutes later, the man called and took my address. He didn't realize that I hadn't even ordered yet, and said that the first woman I spoke with would call me back to get my order, so I waited again. 10 minutes later, the woman called and I tried to place my order. I had to repeat my order several times because she was talking to another customer in the restaurant. She then said she would have to call me back. A few minutes later, she called again and took my order. She told me it would take about 45 minutes for the delivery man to come.  So I waited. And waited. And waited. An hour and 15 minutes passed, so I called the restaurant again, and the same woman apologized and said the driver was on his way and would be at my place in 10 minutes. So I waited again. 10 minutes later, the driver called and said he was lost, so I gave him directions from where he was to my apartment, which was maybe less than 5 minutes away even with traffic. I waited some more until TWO HOURS had passed since I placed my order and finally the driver showed up at my apartment. He was apologetic and nice, but I was really frustrated at this point. I'm an unbelievably patient person, but this was just ridiculous. I settled down to eat my dinner at almost 8:45pm only to find that everything was ice cold. The naan was actually cold to the touch! The food was much worse than I remembered it being in the restaurants, not at all flavorful and unnecessarily oily.   I'm really disappointed, especially since Charkha in the Warehouse District closed, and Mirch Masala is the only downtown Indian restaurant now. I would not recommend getting delivery from here because it would honestly just be faster to walk there and get it yourself."}
{"text":"We were skeptical at first - there were only 2 parties in the restaurant at 5:30pm on a Saturday evening, but the dining room slowly filled as we were eating. Wait staff was attentive and food was prepared in a reasonable amount of time. Food was super yummy and our almost 2-year-old son couldn't get enough of the dahl soup mixed with rice."}
{"text":"I used to go to the Mirch Masala on the square very often for a good chicken tikka. They have moved to this location since then, located above the well known bubble tea shop on state street.  They have a pretty good generic Indian dining menu which is expected. From the popular tikka, tandoori, samosas, pakoras to any \"curry\" dishes that people like.  However, they do a $9.95 buffet supposedly 7 days a week. I went there for Sunday lunch and was offered that or a regular menu and decided to try the buffet. The buffet selection was decently sized with a number of good selections for both vegetarians and meat lovers. There were soup, samosas, pakoras, 3 vegetarian curry dishes, goat and chicken options, tandoori chicken, rice and nan. Bonus is the the selections of chutney and also papadum! Also if you are into Indian sweets, there are the classics as well! Very good value and tasty food at the same time, will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"We arrived promptly at 11:30. Our hostess/waitress seated us and took our drink order. She was friendly in a quiet manner. We watched them bring dishes out to stock the buffet until @11:40 when our waitress told us we could help us ourselves. They continued to bring out new dishes until @ noon. We made several trips to the buffet so there were new dishes to try each time we went back.  It's not the largest buffet but there were many choices and I really enjoyed most of the dishes. The chicken vindaloo was delicious; fairly mild curry w/garlic. It made me think of butter. The goat dish was fantastic; spicy and I particularly liked that I didn't find any bones in it. The naan was plentiful. I enjoyed the biryani, it was fluffy and tasty. The samasos were fragrant. The only dishes I was disappointed by were the chicken tikka and the rice pudding. The chicken was much saucier than I prefer. The pudding was thicker and not as sweet as I'm used to. That may be how they are supposed to be prepared, but I was not a fan.  We'll definitely go back, but next time we'll wait till at least 11:50 so they have time to prepare."}
{"text":"I went here on the recommendation that it was really tasty, but I didn't find this to be true at all. As someone who is accustomed to Indian food from India, I was hoping for some authentic dishes. It was frustrating that all of their food seemed to have a similar spice base. In fact, their paneer sauce tasted more like tomato soup than anything else I'd had.  The service was great and the location was nice, but if you have had Indian food before, don't go here. On a more positive note, their Mango Lassi was tasty (but again, not at all authentic)."}
{"text":"I've walked past this place several times, and was finally able to try them out today for my lunch.  The only option I had to choose from was to get their \"buffet\" which is really pathetic as there is less than 10 items to choose from.  It was also very hard to understand what to do as neither of the people working there spoke English.  Language barriers aside, I grabbed a plate and put some food on it.  Some of the choices were palak paneer, chicken biryani, a chili chicken, and some vegetable pakota.  Drizzled on a few of their chutneys, too.  The first few bites were admittedly decent until I saw a hair in rice of the biryani.  I thought to myself - \"ok, it happens.\"  Not a few bites later I pulled a hair out of my mouth from the palak paneer I just ate.  After that it was like my eyes had opened up and I was really seeing the restaurant for all the filth and dirt that was there.  I understand that for some people eating Indian food is a \"culinary adventure\", but that should refer more to the exotic spices and flavors.  It should not mean having to experience peoples discarded hair."}
{"text":"So so good. Went with 3 people total and ordered 3 different dishes and a bowl of rice. Got the chicken masala, vegetable mango and one other dish. We also got garlic naan. The food was plenty for the 3 of us and we even had extra to go. Really you can't go wrong, the waiter we had was awesome and gave great descriptions of everything. I would highly recommend Mirch Masala."}
{"text":"Loved loved the food! Everything was just too amazing! For $10.50, I think it's one of the least expensive buffet I have ever had :) Very impressed"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, all around. The pakora is amazing, and their butter chicken is sweet and tangy, just as it should be. I love the owners! They are so kind. If you are planning on buffet, you should call ahead just to make sure that they have everything ready."}
{"text":"Shrimp and goat curry are good , chicken and lamp is not , I somehow like the curry and is willing to visit again .   Personal notes , three stars means I am willing to visit again but not regularly"}
{"text":"Wow! Came to Brampton for my hubby to have surgery and decided on Indian food for last meal before hospital food.  What a lovely surprise Butter chicken that looks like it started out as tandoori that was simply divine and lamb korma that melts in your mouth! We are full and enjoying the wonderful after taste of perfectly prepared food.  The service is also great!  Home run!"}
{"text":"Authentic Indian food with great flavors. The all you can eat lunch option allows you to sample many different dishes. The paneer fish was my favorite."}
{"text":"Went with my son,husband and very picky MIL with our  dogs. Sat outside. Food was very good. We had chicken tikka, goat curry, samosas, naan and saag paneer. Everything was amazing and fresh. Mango lassi and good beer too! Knocked one star due to bathroom."}
{"text":"Walked in a 12 noon. Seemed busy. Grabbed a plate that was soaked still. Got to the buffet and it was empty. They need to figure out how to keep the food up and dry their plates. I walked out. No idea if the food is any good."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and had a great experience. The goat biryani was absolutely delicious and spicy. The chicken tikka masala was good although was a slightly sweeter than what tikka masala should be. Next time we will definitely ask for it to be spicier. The water was a little weird tasting and didn't have ice. The bollywood channel on the tv was quite entertaining. Other than the slightly too sweet tikka masala and somewhat slow service, this would have been a five star! Overall a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Update: This place is still, just ok, but this visit was better than the initial visit, which was within a week of it's opening.   Today, the selections were much better, the food was warm and pretty tasty.   The chicken tikka, was very good.  It was flavorful, with hints of lemon.   There was also a red bean curry-type dish which was excellent paired with the basmati rice.    The naan was replenished regularly and there was also brown rice, as an alternative to the white basmati rice.  T"}
{"text":"I have ordered pickup several times, every time it has been very good.  The to-go containers are small because the entree and rice are separated, but once you combine the rice and entree together, you will see it is a nicely sized portion.  Although I wouldn't call the portions large, there was plenty enough for me for lunch, with maybe a fifth of it left over for later.  The food is very good, the to-go containers don't seem to leak (this is a frequent problem with pickup when curry is involved).  It's not cheap, I would say the prices are about 20% more than you would expect to pay at a non-downtown location, and that's pretty standard.  When Charkha existed down the street, the prices were nearly identical.  If you're looking for cheap Indian, definitely hit Indies in the arcade instead, however I like the food here much better.  The butter chicken is thick and creamy and delicious and not weak and watery like at Indies.  Pickup service is prompt and the food was hot, ready, and waiting every time when I arrived.  My biggest (and only) complaint is that there is no parking anywhere near their location.  For pickup, I have to park (illegally) around the corner, about a block down the street and walk up to the restaurant's location.  It would be very difficult to try to find real parking nearby, you're probably better off walking.  But all things told, I think this is the best of the three Indian restaurants that were or are located downtown.  I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Not the very best Indian food I have had, but is delicious nonetheless (technically it's Indian-Nepali here). I have been for the lunch buffet only, which is a fantastic deal, especially with $1 off for showing a student ID. The naan is always delicious and the spread is very consistent. Usually multiple meat curries as well as multiple veggie dishes and a salad station.  You can't miss the gulab jamun for dessert- moist, sweet balls of dough in a rose honey sauce."}
{"text":"Mirch is my goto Indian food restaurant. I get the tikka masala and it is a good size and consistently tasty (I go here pretty often).  I will say on Friday or Saturday nights it can get busy and the service is slow at those times... but understandable and my service has always been polite. They also charge for naan, which kinda sucks, but this seems customary in this area.  It is always hot and fresh. I recommend maybe getting two orders if you are sharing and really like naan."}
{"text":"I miss this place real bad. Their buffet was always on point. The chili paneer was my favorite. Their variety, professional service is very much missed as I now live and California and the Indian out here is nowhere near Mirch Masala."}
{"text":"We had a good buffet here. I sampled all the food and enjoyed my meal. The kabob was notable as was the fruit salad desert. The nann bread and chutneys were spot on. There are better buffets, but from my experiences, you'd have to go to Columbus for a better one with meat."}
{"text":"I wanted to love Mirch Masala.  I really did.  I tend to hate buffets as I love my food prepared to order.  In this case, the food actually had pretty good taste and flavor.  The problem?  Most of it was cold.  Not luke warm, but actually cold.  There were four of us and we all had the same complaint.   This was the real downer of MM.  We were also well into their lunch service at about 12:30, so it wasn't like we marched in as they opened.  The service was pretty mediocre too.  If I go back, I'll order off the menu and skip the buffet."}
{"text":"Mirch is a quick spot to grab food as it is right down the street from our apartment downtown.  I ordered the chicken biryani and hubby went for the lamb vindaloo.  We also had two orders of garlic naan.    I ordered online and then went to the restaurant to pick the food up and bring it home.  Online I owed more than what the restaurant waiter told me I owed.  When I gave a quizzical look he stated \"oh yea, online the price is always more.\"  Word to the wise, do not pay online, pay when you pick the food up - they don't tell you it is extra if you pay online first and then pick up - they just do it.   Anyway the lamb vindaloo was great, and the garlic naan tasted good and they give quite a bit for the price.  Although the chicken biryani was ok, I would never order it again.    Decent food, but I'm still on the look-out for excellent."}
{"text":"Food was good, but extremely spicy (we asked for very spicy...). Super fast delivery on a weekend night."}
{"text":"Nice buffet option for lunch. They offer a full menu as well, but I've only ordered the buffet. Food choices turn over frequently from day to day. I would say their food is prepared with great flavor, rather than over-powering spice."}
{"text":"Food here is very spicy(not hot), because of the spice its hard to get the taste of dishes. Food quality is fine. Service is not friendly."}
{"text":"Loved it. Nicest people in the world, fantastic naan, and the cheese in the mattar masala was heavenly."}
{"text":"This restaurant is adequate. As it is always difficult to discern how to order your food, which degree from mild to spicy, this is a place to err on the milder side. The medium spice level on the mango curry caused my husband's temples to sweat. The spice level on the Panek Paneer was just fire with no smoke;so no additional taste to add to the dish's enjoyment.  The chai tea is adequate although it should be served with sugar and a teaspoon. Talking about basics, they did not serve the meal with napkins, just knives and forks, so long sleeve advisory- The waiter was friendly and the service was attentive!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this restaurant. It has an awkward open layout, but I'm slowly discovering that most restaurants on state street do. I guess it's just dat college vibe! Food was good, satisfying and at a decent price. Went for dinner and what I really wanna do is go back for the lunch buffet to try EVERYTHING!!"}
{"text":"I love Indian and believe than any Indian is better than no Indian. And that's pretty much what Mirch Masala delivered. We went in for the lunch buffet and we were excited about the number of people inside but honestly, the food lacked flavor and had been sitting for too long. Giving it more than one star because the lady working the tables was very nice and kept our waters full.  In a city like Madison, I knows there's better out there. Keep looking."}
{"text":"Good, authentic Indian food. Wide selection of dishes to satisfy the herbivores, omnivories, and carnivores.   Tip: They have a 5-level spiciness rating system. Unless you comfortably cook with ghost peppers as an ingredient, order one level down (less spicy) than what you think you want."}
{"text":"Went to the lunch buffet week before Christmas as I was craving indian food.  Service was poor but main issue was almost everything on the buffet was cold and bland. It's almost as if the cooks were reading a recipe book. I never got a second water and place was pretty empty.  I give it 6 more months before it shuts down."}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch or dinner. View of the capitol too! Only gave it 4 stars though because it looks like every other Indian restaurant (Like a Banquet hall) But the food was great! Had the beef curry and rice and 5 stars on the food."}
{"text":"Great spot on State Street to satisfy your curry cravings! I've been here a couple times and each time my plate has been consistently good. The curries are creamy and the briyani is really good too! Naan is hot, made to order (love the garlic one). Can't go wrong with the sombosas for appetizers too. Service is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"If I had written a review for Mirch Masala when they were located on the square I would have easily given them a 5 out of 5 stars, but I can't due to my last visit. To be honest I have to give them 3 stars due to service... But the food was very flavorful and I love Indian food, if the service wasn't bad I could easily see myself giving them 4 or 5 stars.  We were attending a concert last Saturday at the Orpheum Theatre and wanted to grab dinner before the show. I had a craving for Indian food and remembered how much I enjoyed Mirch Masala previously. We arrived around 5pm and there were 2 other tables already dining. We were seated right away. Unfortunately the service was extremely slow. We waited about 5 minutes before the server (the hostess) came to get our drink order. At that point we each ordered a beer, and our food. It took another 10 minutes for her to bring us our beers. After another maybe 10-15 minutes our food arrived. Maybe we should have told our waitress we were in a hurry. Mind you we have now been waiting at least 35-40 minutes.  This is where I was even more upset. I remember Mirch Masala previously served Daal soup as an appetizer.. That was not the case this time. I was a bit let down but it is what it is. If I wanted it that bad I guess I should have ordered it off the menu vs assuming it would be included like it previously was.   The food was delicious as I remember. We ordered 2 types of naan, my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (spice level 3), and I ordered the Seekh Kabab (spice level 2). I thought my dish was spicier than his was. Both were good but I think I would bump up the spice level if I go back.   Once we were clearly done, it took another 5-10 minutes for our waitress to come with our bill... Since we were in a hurry we just gave her our payment and left as soon as she brought back the change. For as empty as the restaurant was, the service should have been much faster."}
{"text":"I get it now. I used to hate Indian food, but oh man, not anymore. Mirch Masala, I love you. Please don't ever leave me.  I don't think I could ever properly write a review for this food. I'm unfamiliar with the spices and methods used in Indian cooking. All I know is this is some of the best food I've ever had in my life. I'm sorry Paul's Pelmini, but this is my new comfort food.   I order here quite often and I always get buttered chicken, samosas, keema naan, garlic naan, and aloo paratha. I've had a few other things here and there, but those are my happy place. Split between my boyfriend and I. I don't eat the rice. I just dip naan in curry. It's really too much food, if we're being honest. I just don't know what to cut. It's all too good.  The butter chicken is delicious, creamy, liquid gold. The naan is almost always perfect. Sometimes the garlic naan can get a little hard and sometimes the keema naan can get a little tough. Neither are a regular issue. Usually they're fluffy, flavorful slices of heaven. The samosas are always perfect. They're fist sized balls of fried spice. Definitely try them if you haven't.  I've only ever gotten delivery from EatStreet so I can't say much as far as the restaurant itself goes. If you're trying to pick which Indian restaurant to order from, I've had them all and this is the right choice. You're not going to regret it."}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious food, happy customers. Came here on a Sunday for the lunch buffet around 2pm, an hour before the buffet closed. The owners were so nice, and they cooked more food when they saw us come in. Everything here is absolutely delicious, especially the naan. I've never enjoyed a buffet as much as Mirch Masala.   The samosas are amazing when hot, and make sure to mix the sweet chutney with the cilantro chutney together to make a sweet and savory sauce for the samosas. And the tikka masala? Amazing! I can't have dairy, but I couldn't stop eating it after I had some. Mixed on top of the white rice and eaten with naan... Worth it so much. I need to find a lactose pill that'll work for me so I can enjoy this every day.  Servers refill water often, and they didn't turn people away coming in for the buffet close to when it was closing. Space is very large, and the decor is very calm and neat. Parking is everywhere (street and a parking lot a block away). Just rememeber to pay at the front when you're done!  Love it here, and I plan on coming back when I feel like eating like a king."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is soooo worth it. If you're a college student looking for a decently priced, delicious meal, I definitely recommend going here! The curry selection is great and the tandoori chicken is made really well.   I wasn't too impressed with the desserts. Overall, definitely worth going to!"}
{"text":"Wow, this is good.  Seriously, this isn't your standard boiler plate Indian place.  The spices are just more complex - the vegetable masala hits some nice earthy bass notes, rounded out by a creamy tang.  It's just delicious.  Super affordable and everyone there is so nice.  We always stop here when in Madison."}
{"text":"This was our second time ordering from Mirch Masala. The first time, order was correct and we had no issues. This time our eggplant )Baingan Bharta) was not delivered, instead they sent potatoes and cauliflower. Opened the rice and there was a dark black shirt hair right on top on the interior of the container, contaminating the rice. Lastly, the Vegetable Samosas were raw on the inside. This is highly disappointing, for which I will be reporting to GrubHub, as well as expecting a full refund. I have pics to share. Not sure how to on Yelp."}
{"text":"Probably the best Indian food I have had in a while (coming from a guy who has been eating Indian food forever). Visited this place during my first trip to Madison and I was extremely impressed. Although it wasn't all that fancy and super premium, the food was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. Pure Desi flavors, spices and thick gravy had me sipping my fingers. It is run by students working near University of Wisconsin and they certainly love what they do. Highly recommended if you are a vegetarian stopping. Try ordering less appetizers because they were your typical Indian appz instead order a few more traditional curries along with some naan or rice of your choice, some pickle, papad, and most importantly onions!   Best recommend you carry out if you are distracted by the ambiance because it does not have ambiance and it is a little out of order."}
{"text":"Walked in as I work downtown and wanted to try something different and something quick. Didn't expect a buffet but I walked over to check it out.   A woman came out and just started talking to my loudly in a different language. I assumed she might have known some basic words about the restaurant or food and asked how much the buffet was and tried to ask questions about the menu....she just proceeded to grab a to go box and start putting things in there.  She would occasionally look back at a gentleman in the back who spoke English and would sort of answer a question but just would yell if something was vegetarian or not....  I just decided to try it anyway even though I was already uncomfortable and annoyed not knowing what I was getting myself into.  The food was okay-ish, it was edible. I've had much better Indian food by far and I just wish I knew what was in the food I was eating also.  Yeah never going back here  Very weird experience and off putting."}
{"text":"Authentic Indian restaurant with great service. Their Garlic Naan were really awesome. Paneer Lababdar was tastey. I was not impressed with Baingan Bhartha."}
{"text":"Food was flavourful but the portion sizes were a bit small. Also the garlic shrimp we ordered was super spicy - couldn't eat much of it anyway. The paneer was good and the gravies were yummy. Definitely worth coming back! And if you don't like a ton of spice, make sure to tell them to make the food a bit mild."}
{"text":"Excellent. Had veggie samosas and paneer tikka masala. Excellent comfort food for a cold wisconsin night. Samosas were excellent, filling and nicely spiced. Wandered up and down the street trying to find the place but thats on me. Next time im in madison im here."}
{"text":"Very good food. Nice atmosphere. Very clean. Friendly. Sit inside or out side on a balcony. Smells as good as it taste. Good buffet fresh foods. I will be back."}
{"text":"Just took my family to the lunch buffet to convince our two girls that they should like Indian food.   First off, the food is more like 3 stars, nothing to write home about but solid - I really liked the veggie samosas, the girls now love chicken tikka masala and the mango ice cream was a big hit. Still, nothing to rave about. There are much better Indian places in town (shout out to Chutney's on E. Wash).  But man, the \"service.\" While we were seated promptly as our water glasses did get filled, our server never came back to our table for a drink order, never asked if we wanted anything else and never stopped by to see how we were liking things. And it's not like the place was slammed. Then, to top it off, when we went up to pay for 2 adults and 2 kids (9 and 6) the waitress (who was also working the register) asked how old our oldest daughter was and, when we said \"9,\" told us that 9 year olds were considered adults! Not only is this not what we were told on the phone when we called the previous day, it was also apparent that she was just making the rule up - no one draws the line at 9 and, if there were a policy she would've said \"kids are 12 and under\" or whatever, not \"how old is your specific kid.\"   Anyway, we won't be back - you could do worse but if you bring the kids get ready to pay 10 bucks for them to eat a spoonful of rice and one serving of chicken tikka!"}
{"text":"The food is Ok not that good.. I guess it has a very big advantage due to its location.. hence d good rating..I have been here only because I was in downtown and wanted to eat Indian.."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic addition to the neighborhood! We've been to the new location twice for dinner and once for lunch and couldn't have been more pleased. The food is lovingly prepared with high quality ingredients and served by some of the most genuinely kind and professional waiters in Madison.   I especially recommend the lunch buffet (11-3). At ten dollars it's really a steal."}
{"text":"This was a really nice place with a plethora of choices. As a vegan there were more than the usual Aloo Gobi for me to have. Service was good and seating was easy."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Madison, in my opinion.  I am so glad they reopened!  The samosas and garlic naan are a must.  My boyfriend always gets the tofu buff, which is fantastic.  I love the malai kofta.  The service has always been great too."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here for their lunch buffet, but have had that around 10 times.  I've eaten at a number of Indian Restaurants around town.  I think this place is very similar to most of the other places I've been.  It's always consistent, service is always good, and the food has great flavor.  Although a bit pricey compared to non-Indian restaurants, it's right on par with its' peers.  I think lunch runs about $11 without a drink.  If you like Indian food, and you're used to Americanized Indian Buffets, I think you'll enjoy you're lunch here at Mirch Masala."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Went for dinner and probably best Indian/Nepali food I have ever eaten.its very authentic, the cooks are Nepali and the service is great as well. It's on a second floor so kind of hard to find."}
{"text":"vegans: this is actually a vegetarian friendly menu and a V/VG indicates the status in print. There's nunerous vegan & vegetarian items on the buffet and they're well marked. Wow!  Dal, curries (there's a dark red condiment type sauce to make it hot as you like) and tandoori vegetable. don't miss the  eggplant curries & noodles on the buffet either?   awesome. Don't you love the ethnic food options we get in these progressive college towns?"}
{"text":"Was promised authentic Indian taste by the owner/chef. Ordered the butter chicken and the Daal which was supposedly their best offerings! Couldn't even finish the food and decided not to even do the rest in take out as the flavours were nowhere near to Authentic Mughlai Flavours! Have heard good reviews from friends though so maybe the day we visited - it wasn't just their day!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service.  I lunch here while in the area.  I tried a dish that was something like a lunch sampler and it was awesome.   I would highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch buffet, didn't have to wait but tables were steadily filling and turning over. Servers seem like they need a little more time to practice, very timid and sometimes confused.    While I prefer Indian Flame on the east side or Charkha in the Warehouse District, this place will do the trick for a quick lunch. The food itself tastes like a fast food version of what you can get from them. The squash curry was my favorite from the buffet."}
{"text":"My personal opinions, experiences: Amazing place, highly recommend it.  Thanks for making the chefs speciality extra spicy for me today, you might remember me based on that, great service, great food, very nice atmosphere.  My Wife and I love this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here on Sunday night and we sat outside on the capital square, which was very pleasant. We first ordered a Mango Lassi that tasted great, so we had high expectations for the rest of the meal. We ordered the 2 person meat dish which included Chicken tikka masala, lamb curry and tandoori chicken along with naan and golubjamon(an Indian dessert) all for $40. The naan was good but the curries were terrible. They all tasted overly sweet and were a little too watery. Ive had these dishes at many other restaurants and ive never had them taste sweet before. I dont know if it was an off night for the chef or if that is how they normally taste. The tandoori chicken was even too sweet. None of the dishes had that pop of flavor that Indian/Nepali food usually has, it just tasted like sweet mush that was missing flavor. We had a lot of left to overs to take home but we gave them to some homeless people on the capital square as we walked to our car. The golubjamon wasn't good either. Needless to say, my wife and I wont go back to this establishment, I would not reccommend this restaurant for the curries, just the naan and the mango lassi."}
{"text":"A cozy restaurant with a trendy name; Vast selection of interesting dishes and beverages. Both A la carte and buffet.The latter of which was seemingly very rich and diverse. The menu variety was in keeping with the name of the restaurant; Hot and spice. The Tangy taste was exciting for our tastebuds.service was prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"They have good service and tasty food.  I found beef vindaloo is my favorite - highly addictive - best I've had in the city!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out for dinner and was not disappointed!  We ordered the Dahl puri amazing flavour $4.99 for 6 pcs, 1/2 tandoori chicken delicious $8.99 - it can out on a sizzling hot plate on top of a bed of veggies nice presentation.   For our main we had Butter Chicken, Lamb Korma, Jeera Rice and Garlic Naan (so flakey warm and delicious and made in house!)   The staff were very welcoming, warm and attentive. The place was very tidy and clean.   We will definitely go back for lunch when they have an all you can eat $11.99 Buffett and $7.99 Thali."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with the food here. The service was great and the atmosphere was nice, but it doesn't make up for the terrible food. The biryani here was inexcusably terrible. Corners are cut here it seems. Not only was the food very overpriced, but the quality of was very disappointing. Anyone looking for decent Indian/Nepalese food should look somewhere else. 14$ wasted."}
{"text":"I love the lunch buffet at Mirch Masala and I'm so glad that it has reopened.  My husband and I go to many Indian restaurants in madison and this particular restaurant/chef is our favorite.  I find that their ingredients are fresher and better than some other places nearby.  My particular favorites are their goat curry, veggie noodles, tandoori chicken, and their sweet naan (peshawari) .  What I think sets this place apart are the slight alterations the chef makes to the usual dishes.  For example the palak paneer has more than just spinach in it, I think the chef puts in some leek too which I find quite surprising and pleasant.  Sometimes there is a slight bbq sauce in the tandoori chicken which is awesome.  It isn't the same as other traditionally Indian restaurants, perhaps due to the Nepalese influence.  I really appreciate what this chef/owner is doing with the food.  He was originally the chef of many known establishments, but saved his money up to get a place of his own where he can cook the food he wants and I respect that and hope this restaurant does well in this hidden location."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food on State Street! Visited with my parents for dinner and the food was fantastic. I had the lamb with vegetables in a curry sauce. The medium-spicy level was definitely spicy, but so good! The lamb was cooked perfectly. My mom got the paneer in a red curry sauce, which was also fantastic. Dad got the mixed vegetable appetizer. It had a lot of variety and was a great veggie option.   Service was a little slow, which is why I gave 4/5 stars. You can tell they are typically set up for brunch, so the dinner ambiance wasn't especially charming. Would love to come and try lunch though!"}
{"text":"UPDATE:  THIS GREAT RESTAURANT IS CLOSED!  SO SAD!  The fish pacora is OUTSTANDING!  Best you'll ever eat.  Basically all the curries that aren't a yoghurt base are excellent.  The yoghurt based curries are average.  The owners are wonderful, friendly people that always smile and make you feel pleasant.  I highly recommend trying this place even if you're in an entirely different quadrant of the city."}
{"text":"The best, most authentic Indian cuisine I've ever had. Everything done to perfection and our host Sarabjeet was a riot."}
{"text":"One of my worst food experience happened here at mirch masala.  I ordered a bunch of things for dinner via delivery. Food arrived in expected time frame but   * Lentil soup had a big piece of plastic at bottom * Had eaten naan and curry before realizing plastic  Food gave me terrible upset stomach for next few days.  ****Avoid this place at all costs*****"}
{"text":"We ordered through straight2yourdoor, so maybe that's why the food was so bad, but ... Plenty of people have figured out how to make food taste good, even after a 5 minute car ride.  For 4 people getting one entree and one piece of naan, plus one $4 appetizer, our whole dinner cost $90. And it wasn't good. The dough on our momo was chewy and the naan was like trying to rip off a piece of cartilage. The curries were all watery. I was so upset I just spent $90 on that!  I don't think many people in Madison have had a lot of Indian food if this was good to them ..."}
{"text":"Had the lunch buffet at Mirch yet again.  This is my third visit in two months.  The lunch buffets is consistently good.  I had several different dishes, but my favorite one on this visit was a tofu in a creamy curry sauce.  I absolutely loved it, especially when green chutney and rice were added.  I love Indian food!"}
{"text":"Excellent chaat, okish biriyani, great service. Fresh food. The place is very clean and lively. Unlike the other Indian restaurant s we visited which were so dead!"}
{"text":"I liked this place before they changed their name. It is basically the same. Delicious aloo naan. Good vegetarian options. Very large menu. Always deserted at dinner time.   This was my third snow-storm trip to Madison and we wanted to dine at Taste of India. This time our service was polite and attentive. Of course, we had the place to ourselves. But the server was pleasant and quick with the refills.   The food: overall good flavors. Small dishes for the price, though. Our bill was about $50 for two lassi (drinks), one order of aloo naan ($2.95), and two masala dishes (lamb and vegetable). There wasn't really enough to take home from either of our dishes, and they could have been more generous with the vegetables. But the flavors were there.  Overall a good place and would recommend."}
{"text":"Food was amazing good atmosphere, chef owns couple of restaurants in Ahmedabad and brings same taste in Canada. HIGHLY Recommended."}
{"text":"I came here with high expectations but turned out feeling just ok with the meal. Nothing special, and the food portions were very small."}
{"text":"Did a quick takeaway for a veggie curry and was surprised by a fairly Indian taste. Right amount of spices, well made curry ticked all the right boxes. I am reserving my rating to four stars and would soon go back to have lunch. I am hopeful that it turns to a five star. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"This place is a must try. We ordered the thaali, kulcha and tandoori chicken. I have to say that it is one of the best kulchas I have ever had. The filling was appropriate and the thickness of the kulcha was perfect. I would definitely come back to eat that chicken. The spices were perfect and the meat was tender yet juicy. The chef even came and talked to us."}
{"text":"Well hello there!  Tucked away in an upstairs balcony just off State Street is a nice little Indian treat.  I hadn't heard of Mirch Masala before but have had various Indian places in town and around the country so I am always game for adding another to the list.  The fact that they are not directly on State (albeit mostly on State) is nice because it kept the environment relaxed and allowed us to snag some seats outside for a comfortable lunch on a beautiful sunny day.  Both my wife and I had the lunch buffet, which along with a couple of sodas was only $25 for the two of us.  Good price for a weekend buffet, and the food was great.  While not the best in Madison by any means, I would definitely eat here again, as they had a fairly solid variety and the signature dishes were tasty.  Tikka Masala, Paneer, Pakora, Samosa, Biryani, Goat and Tandori, etc.  The hostess (and owner I believe) was a nice friendly lady who served us, but there was a bit of a service lag and some confusion.  She was walking around randomly a bit, and we had ordered some sodas that I had to go remind her about after they didn't come for a while.  Even after this they didn't get there until we were halfway through our meal, but it wasn't that big of a deal.  The other knock was that when we got there around mid lunch time they were running out of food, but they eventually restocked and the new stuff was fresh and extra delicious.  I'm thinking they had probably just finished with the lunch rush and since there weren't a lot of people there they may have just not been rushing to get stuff out.  I wish I had seen the tin full of naan, as both my wife and I missed it yet others on Yelp had mentioned it is very good.  The patio is worth a visit alone, great place to people watch and take in Downtown Madison.  Combine it with the good food and friendly staff and you have a Yelp sleeper in the works"}
{"text":"This place needs more love from other yelpers. Really. It's been a while and they only have 7 reviews.  After learning that Mirch Masala was closed down, I was sad. This place has left some good impression in me. The food is good and the lady owner is nice too. So, I was ecstatic when they finally re-opened on State street. Yay. It is even closer to my apartment.  State street needs some Indian restaurant and woohhoo: Mirch Masala is here. If you are craving for some Indian food in the middle of the day, come to MM for their lunch buffet. They have a quite selection of menu. Not the best, but it is pretty decent."}
{"text":"This is a off-the-beaten path restaurant up in the NE. We went on a Saturday evening so had the buffet (only available on Friday and Saturday evenings). There was nobody else in the restaurant, but we got fantastic service. The owner was very friendly and was chatting with us and refilling our water all the time.  The buffet was delicious and we kept going back for more. The curries actually had lots of meat in them and she owner kept refilling them with more meat. She mentioned that buffets are hard to keep fresh and it drives her crazy, so she recommended coming back some time when it wasn't a buffet.   The restaurant is very authentic Indian and the owner really cares. It makes for a great experience. I will be back for more."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating the food here. They had a great variety of food, and it all was very tasty. The Mixed Vegetarian Platter was very diversified and all the options were to my liking. We also ordered Chili Chicken and Panner Marsala. Both of them tasted absolutely great, and the genuine taste of the food was enjoyable. But the crazy person in me asked for extra spice, but the way the spice was added felt as though it was after it was cooked, and didn't feel like it mixed in with the curry and hit really hard kind of ruining the taste. But over all the experience was quite enjoyable."}
