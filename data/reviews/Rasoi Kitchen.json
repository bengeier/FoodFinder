{"text":"I was going to write about how tiny and overpriced the portions were (I mean seriously!  Almost $40 for for two tiny takeout boxes and a meager portion of rice and store bought reheated naan that others noted?), but after being bedridden for an entire day with a liquefied stomach, I think that tops the low value.  Of course, it's always impossible to ascertain the cause of poisoning, but the remainder of my food yesterday was homemade food and my son, who didn't eat the Rasoi food, was fine while my husband and I both suffered.  And I agree with the reviewers who found the flavours to be less complex than at other establishments.  Probably would appeal to people who are a little scared of Indian food and need a soft start."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant during a Vine and Dine event. And I was in heaven.  I did think we were going for Indian, but during the introduction it was made very clear that it is more of an Indian fusion, with flavours inspired by Indian cuisine, but using lots of local ingredients.  I love Indian food, and this was just as good. It was amazing to have those flavours in the food, and a good transition to my partner who had never eaten Indian before.   The food was so detailed it's hard to come up with it all, and the menu changes with the seasons since they are supporting local farmers. When were were there we had a bison roast which was to die for yum, and a squash soup which had a goats milk cheese twisted through.   Definitely a place to visit! It's quaint and the staff all seem very passionate."}
{"text":"The restaurant is modern and stylish, the service is nice but the food is catered to a bland palette and not flavorful. The paneer pakoras were obviously reheated, the samosas come from some south Asian supplier where they probably cost 50 cents and are sold for $3, the pain puri was soggy and really bland. The butter chicken was acceptable and thankfully not as creamy. The naan were reheated grocery store pitas. I was very disappointed by the lack of authenticity for the dinner items. The tandoori chicken salad seemed more fresh than the other items.  However, if you feel like getting fooled and love overpaying for what you get then enjoy it. In addition to carrying little of the taste of Indian food, luckily the hygiene in this place was much better than the sticky tables and chairs you find in establishments that focus on food."}
{"text":"I love Love LOVE this place!!  I like Indian food, but this place puts a twist on it that makes it even better.  I'm vegetarian so I can't speak about the meat dishes, but all the veggie items are crazy good.  The decor is serene and lovely.  The staff and owner are warm, friendly and eager to please.  I really can't say enough good things about this place.  Just go there."}
{"text":"Overall I failed to see the western infusion of the whole western/indian fusion.  There were crab cakes and that was about it.     Overall the flavours are decent but not enough to wow.  The lamb entree and pistachio cake were the best of the night.  Pani puri was a let down though.  Good natured waitress.  For the price I would ask for more."}
{"text":"Rasoi is a Marda Loop gem I wish more people knew about. Indian fusion at its finest. Small but to the point menu and there's usually some sort of feature going on like the Karma menu that's happening right now. Jash (the owner) knows his stuff and has created something unique in the vast Foodie-land that is Calgary and I wish him much success!  Do yourself a favour, try it!"}
{"text":"This is a sexy little restaraunt that seats maybe 35.  It is comfortable trendy, good service and has ample parking.  So why only 3 stars?  I am an Indian and am always trying and disappointed by these 'new' fusion Indian restaurants coming out.  They are way overpriced and adding a large wine list does not constitute fusion.  Wild caribou or smoked salmon samosa's (if someone uses these, I would like the credit ;)) are fusion, under spiced everyday Indian food with an English description is not.  Don't get me wrong, the food here was good and if you haven't had Indian food before you will enjoy this, but as an Indian growing up with this food I expect more.  One pet peeve I did have about this place was at these prices, clear away and bring new cutlery for each course.  Taking my dirty fork from my dish and putting it back on the table just looks really sloppy."}
{"text":"5 stars and nothing less.  Rasoi serves some of the best food in all of Calgary. Unique dishes, large portion sizes, reasonable prices. Fine dining experience in a relaxed atmosphere with friendly staff. I love the variety of Rasoi's menu, incorporating delectable vegetarian and vegan (paneer pakoras, pani puri, paneer steak, chana masala, etc) options in addition to their famous beef tenderloin and rack of lamb dishes. The restaurant is always accomodating to dietary restrictions, with the abiltiy to substitute ingredients without compromising the taste of the dish. Whether you are new at trying Indian food for the first time (spice levels can always be adjusted), or already love it and can appreciate great fusion food, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was hunting for someplace a bit \"different\" to take a friend for a belated birthday supper. Natasha K's review of Rasoi convinced me that this place was worth a shot. Indian fusion sounded like it had just enough of a twist.  Monday night turned out to be a great night to head up Marda Loop way. We had no trouble finding a place to park on the street and we had the place to ourselves when we first walked into Rasoi.  The decor was clean and trendy, the lighting wasn't too dim or too bright, and our server was just the right amount of friendly without being overwhelming.   We perused the menu for a bit, but ended up ordering from their Karma Menu. What is a Karma Menu you ask? Well, for $30, you get an appy, an entree and dessert. The menu is set out with two choices for appys, same for entrees and then this yummy little Indian doughnut kind of thing to finish it off. The bonus is that once food costs are covered, the extra money made from the Karma Menu is donated to a charity in India. I was in do-gooder heaven.   The best part of the meal was the pakora, although my sweet tooth wants me to say it was the dessert. The beef and veggie entrees we ate ran a very close second.   At first I gave Rasoi four yums up, but the Karma Menu got them their fifth star. It's only running into December though, so definitely try these guys out soon."}
{"text":"As a lover of world cuisine, I was thrilled to learn that my friend's brother Jash is the owner of Rasoi. And it took me THIS long to finally try it out.  The decor is clean, modern and elegant as I walked in. Jash greeted me warmly and got me a glass of water (cool, refreshing cucumber water with not too much ice) as I looked over the menu.  I chose the coconut curry shrimp with naan to start. The curry was flavourful, but delicate and fresh tasting. There was a slice of lemon perched atop the tiger shrimp, which is both visually stunning and delish. And the naan? Holy. I love naan bread, but these sweet, soft beauties are the best I've had in a long time. When I was finished with the shrimp dish, Jash brought me some more naan to enjoy the curry with. Good thing! I wouldn't want to waste any of it. Compliments to the chef (who I also got to meet)!  I also tried a new lager from Montreal. Refreshingly Canadian and a surprisingly beautiful complement to the Indian fusion food.  Also, Rasoi's equipped with free wireless and is fairly quiet for weekday dinner time. You will need to come early or make reservations for weekends, though.  Will definitely come back with a group of friends for some after work bevvies. Gotta say, I love it!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in a while, quality of our meals was fabulous !! Spicy calamari and the tiger pawns were tasty and set the stage for the rest of our meal. Lovely bride had a steak with a nice twist of Indian spice and cooked to perfection, I had the salmon it was just great. Surprising number of folks popping in to pick up take out in the very comfortable up scale style restaurant. I think will become regulars and can't wait to try the butter chicken and rest of the menu."}
