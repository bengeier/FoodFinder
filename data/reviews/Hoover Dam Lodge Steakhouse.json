{"text":"When we checked into the hotel we ask if there was a good place to eat, they highly recommended the steakhouse. 
 I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki it came with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Vegetable of the day for $16.00. When it came the Chicken was real dark and swimming in a brown liquid it was alright but I think I could have got better at a fast food place. My husband got the 6 oz Filet on the menu said tender well for $24.00 it was not. The service wasn't any to talk about so I won't. It just wasn't a good experience."}
{"text":"Preis Leistung sehr gut. Das Steak schmeckt wirklich gut und die Menge reicht völlig aus. Gegen die Essenspreise in Las Vegas ein Schnäppchen..."}
{"text":"When we checked in Hoover Dam Lodge on 14 AUG 2016, we were told that they have a new steak house restaurant. We tried it out. We spent $51 (excluding tip) for two different steaks and a desset. Friendly staff and we didnt have to wait in line to get seated. However, it took them over 30 minutes to get us our food from the time we ordered. The waitress was very apologetic and said there was a \"big group ahead of us\".  

The restaurant is small and inside the Hoover Dam Lodge itself, on the first floor, besides the hotel's mini market. I can see this business in Google and trip advisor but not in yelp, so I added it. 

I'm adding the photos"}
{"text":"The filet mingon was delicious and cooked perfectly. The sides left much to be desired. Broccoli was over seasoned and mushy and I'm not sure the \"pillow of garlic mashed potatoes\" came fresh from potatoes and was served lunch-lady style in a perfect sphere from the scoop. But I was glad to not have to drive into Boulder for fast food, so there's that. And be meat was great which was the most important part of a steakhouse."}
{"text":"It was cheap in every respect exept the price !!!! They charge you for a salad with a twenty five dollar steak . They mixed up the wellness of the orders as well. The prices reflect a view of the lake BUT THERE ISNT ONE !!!!!@##$#"}
{"text":"Dont know if the steaks are really good or cause its the first filet mignon ive had since november. Ive had a prime rib and ribs but not a good ole fashion steak.

This place is great. Simple one page menu. Steaks and salad and appetizers.

Steak:
Filet mignon
Rib eye (which is a filet mignon with fat)
Top sirloin 
New york
Porterhouse
And i forgot. Look at pics.

My filet mignon was tasty. I recommend adding no salt or seasoning cause... If you add all that just get the cheap shit since it will taste like seasoning and not the beef. 

Gamja: mashed or baked. I get mashed cause eating a baked potato requires too much time/effort.

Veggies. They salt the shit out of em. Horrible.

Service. Just wondefful."}
