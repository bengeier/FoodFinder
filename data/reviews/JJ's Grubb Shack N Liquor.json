{"text":"I guess a good thing must come to an end. Got an order last week Queens Platter and 16 piece wings BBQ spicy with fries. I was completely disappointed with the whole order the queens platter was for my Mother my mom is old school so when she said the fish was smushy with no test I couldn't  believe it since every time we have gotten the fish it was great. I tasted the fish it was beyond smushy with no taste the shrimp was chewy and the wings undercooked.  My wings were undercooked and not seasoned  and were hardly sauces and the normally on no point fries were a smushy mess. I reached out to the Grubb shack to voice my displeasure  and get my money back $30 with no response so very disappointed"}
{"text":"Better than fast food! Has a home/picnic taste to it rather than a commercial taste, recommend."}
{"text":"Customer service is always great, definately the most organized drive thru in the area, good job guys, by the way my son loves the sucker he gets every time we go."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place; I love hole-in-the-wall type places and the lady was really nice. However, it was extremely disappointing and I wish we could get our $30 back. The website promises fast drive through service, but we had to wait over 20 min for our food. The lady was nice and apologized for not having everything ready at the same time and offered us a refill while we waited. This would have been forgivable if the food was edible, but unfortunately it was not. The queens platter was soft and soggy (I had to throw it away). The fried zucchini was cut so thin it tasted like just over fried breading. Also, they accidentally forgot the nuggets for my two year old, which we had to go back for. Burger was just ok. The lady promised that it's not usually like this and to please try and come back, but after loosing 30 bucks, I wouldn't want to risk any more money."}
{"text":"The food is always good; however, there customer service is really bad.  I mean everyone except the hood rat that is loud and ghetto is good.  I mean she actually told me one night that the kitchen was closed on a Saturday at 8pm.  I then pulled up the website and she told me she wasn't familiar with it.  Mind you a week before she had an attitude and began slamming things because I pulled up with my bf 15 minutes before closing to order food.  I would give this place 5 stars if they fired her!!!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a Really good burger so I saw this place on Southern. I decided to check it out on Yelp and decided to give it a try. A little confusing not knowing that it is \"Drive Thru Only\". When I ordered, a young lady came to the window and was very pleasant. She helped me with my ordering and repeated everything back to confirm order. There was 1 car ahead of me and it took about 15 minutes to get my double cheeseburger and fries. I also ordered a small soda and received a milk tanker as my cup. It was gigantic. The burger was very fresh and tasty. Worth the wait. You could taste the grill marks on the burger. Like dad used to make back in the 60's. Really good .  My only negative was that the young lady who took my order, also was the cashier. She had food service gloves on which led me to believe she was cooking the food too. Since you cant see inside, you dont know if she was accepting cash and then handling food with same gloves on. Definitely a Health Department no-no. If she washed hands after she changed gloves, then I would say I will definitely be back. Dont know for sure. I have decided that she is a professional food service worker and understands that people can get very sick if they dont follow Health Department rules and guidelines."}
{"text":"I was really pleased with the burger combo with onion rings which I ordered. The burger patties had a great taste and were juicy not greasy, the veggies were fresh,  and the onion rings were crispy and not greasy. Everything was great, and the service was also very good. The young man was very courteous and you could tell he took pride in what he was doing. They do make everything fresh to order so I would recommend phoning in your order if you're in a hurry.  I will definitely be back and recommend this place to anyone that's in the Laveen area. Definitely a good local business to support."}
{"text":"Great for lunch, burgers Fries, cooked to order so you will wait about 10 mins. It's a drive up window no inside eating. But our mechanics love to go there & grab a good big meal for your $. Better than little fast food BK burgers better price too.   They have other food besides burgers but haven't tried them."}
{"text":"Hands down...the best drive through Iv'e ever been to...with the multiple windows there is never a wait for anything...a really well designed method..Good job"}
{"text":"A very disappointing eating experience.  Had been excited to try a local place and now wish I had gambled with the 2 stars at Applebees.  Waited a long time in the drive-thru for our food and were told that the double cheeseburger had not been started yet, meaning that our plate of fried food was left sitting while it was made.  I was also surprised that the woman did not know exactly what kind of \"fish\" was in the platter.  When it arrived all of the fried items were soggy and barely warm and some were burnt as well.  All of the items, including the burger seemed pre-made and frozen from a package/box - nothing seemed fresh.  One of our items was forgotten.  Woman working was nice and apologetic but does not make up for the bad food and the wasted money.  I will not return and will not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple  times and I love love love their wings. They have alot on the menu but been to addicted  to the wings to try anything  else lol"}
{"text":"Simple, good food. No nonsense. I'm a fan. I will be going back today for dinner!"}
{"text":"My first choice for wings every time. A better taste for less money. I have JJ's on speed dial. The guys are always glad to see you and present themselves well. One would not expect such service from a drive through."}
{"text":"The food was delicious.... I have a tear... mmmmmmm chicken wings on point 100%  watch out Marcias"}
