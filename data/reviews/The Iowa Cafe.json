{"text":"Heard about the biscuits and gravy, they were pretty good, but lacks service as I needed a refill on my water....and haven't received any water, probably under staffed....coffee wasn't pleasant..."}
{"text":"We visited the new Iowa Cafe location at Higley and Brown on Feb. 13th, 2012 with friends and were looking forward to having a good time, especially when we had a short wait signing in and saw that the place was hopping--it has to be good with people streaming in! That was the end of the excitement: our booth was ripped and very lopsided, then we waited over an hour to get our food which was mediocre at best. When we finally caught the waitress to mention the long wait and we needed to make an appointment, she managed to get our friend's food out and they started eating. I think we finally caught her again about 10 min later to ask where our food was. It would have been nice after that long wait to at least get to eat along with our friends! My patty melt had soggy bread, as though it had been sitting for awhile and I was given fries rather than the cole slaw I chose as my side. My husband's corned beef sandwich had cheese and sauerkraut  in it which wasn't listed on the menu. He felt it was a strange combination but we were so glad to finally get our order, we just ate and got out of there. We felt the wait staff was not just busy, they were quite lax. The food was poor and the wait unbearable and not excusable or even understandable. From what we hear, this place is usually very busy. If so, why not prepare, have more staff and definitely get a new cook! We will never go back."}
{"text":"The Iowa cafe is moving its location to Higley and Brown The food is good and like the claim it taste home cooked friendly wait staff good service quaint atmosphere I ordered the home made meatloaf and mashed potatoes there were smothered with a brown gravy $7.95 good food good price"}
{"text":"This place was ok.   We were driving around trying to find a place to try in our new neighborhood and for some reason the building here sort of stood out. It didn't really...we were just hungry.  When you walk in, as the name suggests, you're overwhelmed with Iowa stuff which is interesting. To your right would be a bar (in terms of sitting at the bar to eat your meal) and a couple TVs). To your front and left is the seating which doesn't have any kind of privacy. You could be inches away from the table next to you.  Sitting there looking over the menu kind of reminded me of Joe Pesci from My Cousin Vinny when they ordered breakfast: \"we'll take two breakfasts\". There is plenty to choose from it just felt limited at the same time, if that makes sense.  The service was good.  The food itself was nothing to write home about. We'll only come back if we want that midwest/southern feel."}
{"text":"Awesome locally owned mom-and-pop type diner.  My wife and I went there for breakfast last night (breakfast served all day!).  I got the pancakes, my wife got the biscuits and gravy.  We were both very happy with the food, the portions, and the price.  The service was a little slow, but we also came during the dinner rush (which, with the number of retired folks in the area, is pretty early).  I'll be back, no question."}
{"text":"Unless your over 60 don't go , waited to be seated , people got seated in front of us . Order food came out bland and tasteless . When we got the bill it was someone else's bill, finally got ours and it still didn't seem right . Finally just paid and left to get out of there . Won't be back ."}
{"text":"Too expensive. Portions too small. Zero food quality. Iowa Cafe gives chains a great name. Go to the Cracker Barrel!"}
{"text":"Nothing offensive against older people however when I walked in and it looks like a nursing home scene I should have gotten a clue about the food. Bland, powdered mashed potatoes and gravy, undercooked - doughy dinner roll and canned gravy... I'll pass."}
{"text":"Kitchy, cozy, down-home feeling place.  Pretty much what you'd expect from a breakfast/lunch hole in the wall but cleaner!  The food was pretty good (standard breakfast and lunch/sandwich offerings) and the coffee was really good.  The server was very attentive and friendly.  We enjoyed our lunch here on a friend's recommendation and would be happy to pass the recommendation forward."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. We sat down, waited 39 minutes to get menus, another 30 minutes to get water. They didn't take our orders until we were there for at least an hour....and we waited almost 45 minutes to eat breakfast. We were very disappointed because we went our ways to go there since we are from Midwest. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place for the first time this morning with a friend.  Got seated right away great... Water and coffee right after great. Ordered and food served quickly, Awesome, then it all goes downhill from there as the restaurant starts to fill up.  My friends food was served without the bread so we asked for the bread which was delivered when she basically finished her meal, no apology for that, never was our coffee or water refilled. Tables were all getting seated and not getting any attention, people sitting and waiting as they keep seating and filling up the restaurant.  Saw a table sit and wait and finally walked out. Some tables were waiting for 15 minutes till coffee was even offered.  Just a few suggestions.  1. Having two waitresses on a busy Sunday morning not a smart choice.  2. Waitresses may want to have a more friendly attitude.   The food was great just a big disappointment in service. I used to waitress and I know it's not easy but you know Sunday's get busy so have another server on. Would make a huge difference.  Not sure if I will go back at this point honestly.   Disappointed customer"}
{"text":"The hour and a half Breakfast... I'm sure the food would've been good had it been warm.  I'm sure our visit would have been pleasant had we not sat waiting for our food for so long that rigor mortis was setting in.  Was impossible to get a refresh on our coffees. I think because the server didn't want to come to our table anymore. If there was a problem in the kitchen, it would've been nice if the owner had come over to our table and let us know. Some were getting up and leaving. And then there were some who came in long after us who were served and done and gone before we were served.   Not the Iowa caf√© I remember."}
{"text":"I was hungry for breakfast along my cycling journey this morning and saw this gem along the way.  It looked to be a small business and locally owned, something that met the criteria for my blog.  The breakfast here is not only amazing but comes at an extremely fair price.  The customer service was above and beyond and something you will find with a local restaurant.  If Melissa is there try to get in her section as she is a top notch waitress.  Fun, bubbly personality with a great sense of humor.  I had the Chicken fried steak here and it was super delicious.  They serve breakfast, lunch and supper at all hours too so thats really nice.  Screw IHOP or Dennys, take the time and stop in to the Iowa Cafe.  I'll certainly be back.  For a more detailed review please check out my blog at www.azspicycycler.com and check out my YouTube channel (search azspicycycler) for my video."}
{"text":"I thought I would give this place a try regardless of the reviews I have read,  I live right around the corner from this spot and I will say there are a bunch of great breakfast spots in the area so you really need to step it up to compete.  The service was good,  and when you walk in you get a nice mid west diner vibe.   But aside from that I didn't really enjoy anything.  One of my pet peeves is not brewing your own ice tea,  ice tea from a fountain is terrible, which is what I got from here.   I ordered the country fried steak with eggs and country fries (crispy).  The country fried steak seemed to be pre frozen and the gravy was so salty I wasn't able to eat it.  I don't think food is made from scratch at all.   The potatoes were just sliced and deep fried which were fine but not crispy like I ordered.    Overall they need to really work on the food,  unless I hear they do a overhaul on the menu I don't think I would come back which is too bad because the atmosphere is somewhere I could definitely see myself hanging out for a bit in the morning to do some work."}
{"text":"One of the very few places one can get a breaded tenderloin sandwich. I used to have favorite place back in Iowa for tenderloins...this is better. If anyone reading this is from Des Moines and knows Smitty's Tenderloins on Army Post Rd they you'll love this place. The tenderloins taste the same but they're thicker. I have yet to have a pie there but I hear they're to die for."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service and HAIR in food!  4 out of the last 5 times I've been here, the service has been terrible. August 21st was our last and final time.  We were sat down in the corner. And yes, they were busy for a Sunday. But not completely packed.  It took 11 minutes before we were seen by anybody just to order drinks.  11 minutes may not sound long, but that's completely unacceptable in the restaurant business. So of course we ordered our food as well after we saw our waitress for the first time, cause who knew how long it would be before we saw her again.        The food was always good.  It's what kept us coming back.  Hoping they could get a handle on the abysmally slow service. But this Sunday after my girlfriend finished her plate of biscuits and gravy, she found a HAIR in her gravy! Buried right at the bottom. Disgusting.  We'll never be back there again."}
{"text":"Back in the day... 'bout 8 years ago -- this was my favorite breakfast. Excellent portions (not too big-not too small) It's a classic short order diner that does/did things right. There cinnamon rolls are awesome and don't forget to try some pie some time. That said, I've seen a slight dip in service the last couple times which is why I didn't give it four stars in case something is change there I don't know about. Other than that, it really is a good place to get a breakfast. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Lets just start out by saying....years ago when you saw the word Cafe, you just knew the food was going to be great, the waitresses would greet you like they'd known you for years & the owner would be right there helping & making sure everyone felt welcome! This is not the case at this Cafe!!!! The older lady that seated us, was gruff, extremely rude & was very nasty to my husband & I with her tone of voice. Why would you own an eating establishment if you were not a people person? Doesn't make sense at all. This owner & I'm being more than polite, is an ASS!! I felt sorry for the staff & yes she spoke down to them too. So, the ONLY reason the Iowa Cafe even gets one star, is because of our waitress (Katie) who was soooo sweet & spoke to us like we were real people. THANK YOU KATIE, you are an angel. The Iowa Cafe should have a sign on the door that reads \"WARNING....ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK, OWNER HAS HER HEAD UP HER ASS\"!!!!!"}
{"text":"The \"new & improved\" Iowa Cafe leaves a lot to be desired.  The restaurant has moved from it's former location into an old vacant fast food drive-thru establishment (I believe it used to be an Arby's).  My husband and I have been on & off again customers over the years and have never had any major complaints about the wait times, food or service levels. After driving through the area a few weeks back, we noticed the new signage, \"Iowa Cafe,\" and we're both thinking, \"Cool, they're moving\" and we were excited to come back.  Well, with much disappointment I must say, our experience was sub-par at best, which is NOT at all what we were expecting.  We arrived, placed our name on the waiting list, which in all we maybe waited 10 mins (if that), so that was a thumbs up.  Then we were seated at a 2-top by the exit door, which looked like the space would best serve a newspaper rack and a couple of gum ball machines, rather than a spot to enjoy a meal (thumbs down).  We were seated by the owner and quickly greeted by the waitress who filled our drink order (2 coffees).  When she returned, we quickly ordered; my husband a 2 meat omelet and I ordered 1 pancake, 2 sausage links with 1 scrambled egg, nothing too complicated, right?  Wrong!  After finishing up our 2nd cup of coffee having waited over 20 minutes we began to wonder where our food was, just then an older couple was seated across from us in an equally poor spot.  (On a side note, when we were seated a young couple with a baby in a highchair were sitting in this spot, when the owner came by and moved them to another table stating that it is a fire hazard to seat anyone there). About 15 minutes later, the couple who was sat across from us received their food.  The older man quickly said, \"Have you folks received your food yet?\"  We smiled and politely said, \"no, not yet.\"  Then he said, \" you know we've been going to the Iowa cafe for over 30 years!\"  And after a few minutes of chit-chat, we settled back into our tables.  Now, finishing our 4th cup of coffee, our wait time had surged to over 40 minutes.  We had a vet appointment for our dog at 1:45pm, it was now 1:05pm, not able to wait any longer and seeing no signs of our food, watching table after table receiving theirs, we finally flagged down our waitress and said, \"we never received our food, we've been waiting 45 mins!\"  The waitress looked shocked (however, keep in mind she was filling our coffee cups the whole time and serving others around us whom she helped AFTER us)..  The waitress did do the right thing, she comped our coffees and didn't charge us for the food we never received.  At that point, we up and left even more hungry than we had come, but now had nothing in our tummies to offset our extreme coffee buzz.  This may have been an oversight, but having said nothing is worse than keeping us informed or admitting a mistake was made.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"The place was real busy but we were greeted right away.  This was my first time there and I thought the food was pricey for a cafe. I had the biscuits and gravy, one egg, bacon and my signature item of choice, pancakes. The eggs were fluffy and hot, bacon was good sausage gravy was fine, I needed more black pepper on it but that's a personal choice.  the pancake however left much to be desired.  Could not cut it with a fork.  I tried my husbands home fries and they were also very good.  I am going to go back one more time to try the omelette and that will help me decide if I go back."}
{"text":"Food was not awful, but atmosphere and basics lacking. Always leery of a place that has fountain iced tea."}
{"text":"My husband likes to find what he calls \"quirky\" places to go to for dinner for his birthday. He picked The Iowa Cafe this year, probably because he's from Iowa. He had the all you can eat fish and said the fish was pretty good, fries were terrible. I made the mistake of ordering their turkey sandwich, which, according to the menu, was supposed to be \"special\". It was not. It was turkey lunch meat and the bread was stale. I could only manage to eat 1/2. It would have cost me probably $1.00 to make this at home but it was $8.00 there. And yes, the fries were awful. Tasted like elementary school food. We didn't try the pie, which I hear is very good. I will also say the wait staff was friendly, but a little slow. I doubt we will go there again. And for sure...don't anyone order the turkey sandwich!"}
{"text":"Great food and usually great service. But Friday nights during winter visitor season they are understaffed. The ladies do as well as can be expected, but I've never seen owners or management here when things are hopping and they need help. We've been here for breakfast and it's busy then, too...people are going to start leaving if they have to wait too long."}
{"text":"Everything from the service to the food is spectacular!!! The wait staff make you feel like family and the food is like mom cooked it with love, but even better. Seriously THE BEST Biscuts and cinnamon roll I've EVER had. I'm a super picky eater and breakfast is my favorite meal so the fact that I love this place says a lot. Don't miss out on this place and if you get the cinnamon roll top it with nuts and raisins... you will not be disappointed! Don't let the decor and simple building fool you! It may  not be as fancy as Over Easy or decorated like Hen House, but it's soooo much better than both! So what are you waiting for? Get your Iowa Cafe on people!  BTW, for those that can't stand public bathrooms, like me, you will be impressed with this one. The sink in the bathroom is beautiful and everything is very clean! :)"}
{"text":"This place has a pretty good breakfast and that is what I am writing my review on because I haven't tried their lunch.  Apparently they have really good pie too but I haven't had that either.  They moved the location from McKellips to Higley which is great because it is closer to my house.  I will give them a try again but I already have a couple breakfast places I like to go."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a midwestern style place or some pie this is the place to go.  Definitely a small town feel.  Nothing fancy here but sometimes that's just what your stomach wants!"}
{"text":"Pork tenderloin is the best around! They also have a loose meat sandwich that is fantastic."}
{"text":"First visit, lunch time April 21, 2015. The place was busy, about 70% full.   Let me first say this about the resturant, the dining area is exceptionally clean and well maintained. Not very fancy but spotless clean.   I ordered the loose-meat sandwich (aka Maid-Rite, authentic Marshalltown Iowa), fries and lemonade. The fries were plain but hot. The bun was soft and nice, the meat was dry dry dry and  a bit over cooked. The sandwich is served plain, which is not authentic Taylor's. Iowa Cafe's is like a sloppy joe sandwich without anything added to the beef.  Even the mustard and ketchup at the table couldn't help it. The beef was decent, tasted like actual beef, give 'em credit for that.  Service was excellent, I tipped well. Patrons and staff were friendly, 100% family atmosphere.  Total for sandwich, fries, and a drink with tip was $13  Would I go back? Perhaps, but I'd never order that sandwich again. I saw others eating huge portions seated at other tables, my lunch didn't meet that description.  Easy access, plenty of free parking."}
{"text":"Well the first few times is okay.  After that, the place goes down hill.  The staff there seems friendlier to Iowans, or those who are not NYers.  Had 2 bad dinners there..quit going after that.  The pie is good.  Go for dessert."}
{"text":"Is Zero Stars an option?  Went on a Saturday morning, 930am. Hostess sat us at a high top table, we asked for two waters... Then nothing.   Crickets chirping.   People that came in same time as us all ready drinking coffee and placed their order.   Nothing. No one brought the drinks.. no one came by to say \"Hi, be right with you...\" Nothing.   After probably 10 mins we got up and found the girl that got our drink request..  She says .. \"sorry.. I forgot to tell your waitress\".   Great...  Even so, in the course of 10 mins a waitress with eyeballs should be able to see someone new sitting at their table looking around for help.   Nothing.   Maybe the food is good? I don't know. We never got any.   That's Zero Stars. It's the worst thing a restaurant can do.. completely ignore a customer until they give up and walk out to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Have been going to the Iowa Caf√© both old & new location since we bought our little house in Mesa a few years ago. Being a homegrown Iowa girl I knew I would love the things on their menu. Of course I gravitated immediately to the loose meat sandwiches and the pork tenderloin.  We stopped in today and were seated at a booth. It appeared as if the old saying of \"when the cats away the mice will play\" was in effect this afternoon. There appeared to be a lot of Horsing around, kidding around, and not much waiting on the customers.  Had to ask for silverware for our table. When my husband and I both placed an order for a loose meat and french fries and a tenderloin to share, I got mine but he did not get his & the waitress said she misunderstood and hadn't put an order in for him.  Had to flag down the waitress multiple times to get a refill on our drinks. The big disappointment though was the loose meat sandwich it was so dry that it was almost not edible and in fact my husband and I both left half of it. I also felt the tenderloin was somewhat overcooked but it was edible. Very disappointed in my Iowa Caf√© as I have always considered it a Little home away from home but this is actually the second time I have felt that their food was not up to par."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here several times. The service has always been fantastic. I will say that they do keep their restaurant a little on the warm side, but given that the clientele is a little older I do understand. We have ordered a few different things off of the menu and they have always been fantastic. Their pork tenderloin is my favorite, and it is NOT a health food. Wait staff is always very friendly and the restrooms have always been clean. This has been our \"go to\" breakfast/brunch restaurant for the last couple months. Nothing beats an Iowa home cooked meal."}
{"text":"Great home cooked food. Best tenderloin sandwich there is. Even better than my grandmas (but I didn't tell you that). And HUGE too. Nice owners/waiters and good prices."}
{"text":"\"Well, my wife's from Iowa so that pretty much makes me from Iowa too.\"  This place is a diamond in the rough.  A needle in a haystack. A king among men.  Well, you get the idea.  It's located between 'Bum F*** Egypt', and 'Where the hell am I', but it is worth the drive!  We usually run down there for breakfast because they have the BEST whole wheat pancakes this side of Iowa city! The rest of the food there is pretty much what you would expect from a midwestern greasy spoon, but the pies... oh the pies...  The only downside to writing a review about their pies, is that the english language doesn't have words to describe how utterly amazing they are. Exquisite? Nay.  Delectable? Closer, but not close enough.  I will simply say that if you venture to the realm of this genius facility, pie it up."}
{"text":"Im dining in the restaurant as we speak- note to self- don't come here again.   When you walk in it's confusing- everyone is cramped into the front or in a little door entrance   It took the server 10 minutes to approach our table and take our order  Food took 20-25 min to get to us, I ordered the biscuits and gravy and clearly the gravy was from a can with about 2 specs of sausage in it. I sent it back and they offered me some more toast or home fries. No thanks.   Price seems kind of high for a breakfast place especially since the food sucks. 8.00 for biscuits and gravy with toast and hash browns.   Go somewhere else before your disappointed like I am."}
{"text":"This is a Nice Cozy Cafe.. Warm Waitress made me andd Husbands first time there special ,can tell she haf regulars.. The food Was awesome, service was great, prices are what to be expected for breakfast.. Warning to small eaters.. I ordered the two pancakes!!!! OMG took up my whole plate that is how BIG they were.But they were very yummy took the leftovers home.. Will be back.. I love finding little gems hidden..And cannot wait to try her famous pies..will have to come for lunch or dinner.. Thank you"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here! The food is always delicious and the employees are so sweet. Their sausage gravy is a gift from God."}
{"text":"I actually did a search for best pies in Phoenix and this place turned up. Ugh. Well the best place isn't actually near Phoenix, but I wasn't about to drive up 65 miles north to Rock Springs for their apple crumble, and THEN drive back here.  So I took a long drive to Mesa, which is a larger city than I thought. And I entered the late morning breakfast crowd of tiny Iowa Cafe.   This is a very small place. I sat next the register. I had had breakfast very early that morning so all I came in for. So really I wanted a slice of their \"famous\" pie and a cup of coffee. Mistake: I got the \"cherry supreme\", which was a gloppy, thick viscous cream that had bits of cherries in it, whipped cream on top. It was not a pie as much as it was a gloppy pile. Also it smelled and tasted like it had taken on fridge odors overnight.The coffee was stale and not very hot. Oh, and I added a side order of scrambled eggs and they were cold and rubbery.  I suppose if you advertise that you sell Midwest traditional pies Iowa style you should probably have your best pies out there. But this was not the case that morning."}
{"text":"Horrible service, poor food quality.  Soup was salty, fish over cooked and waitress was horrible.  Never again."}
{"text":"If it weren't for our uncle (from Iowa) wanting to try this place, we would likely never have come here.  The place has different Iowa college banners lining the entire inside which pleased our uncle.  He was nostalgic of the famous Iowa breaded pork tenderloin which happens to be their specialty along with their pies and cinnamon rolls.  Not a place to go if you are looking for healthy breakfast.  I was laughed at with \"it's Iowa food. You're not gonna find healthy haha.\"  We ordered a cinnamon roll to share and it was very fresh and soft but the icing was too sweet.  Still haven't found one better than a Cinnabon.  The giant breaded pork tenderloin lived up to its reputation and more.  It was like a chicken fried steak but 10x better because it tasted like real meat.  You can taste the juicy pork under the ultra crispy breading.  The monstrosity was not complete without bacon gravy, home fries, toast, and eggs.  Some would call this a \"diabetes platter.\"  We also ordered the corned beef hash which was equally gigantic with all the works.  It specified homemade corned beef and had a good flavor.  Really wish the beef was much bigger pieces. It was very grounded and not quite satisfying.  The blueberry pie was also good but not sure about the \"award-winning\" label.  Overall, this was a nice find with no wait on a weekend.  Good place to go once in a while if you feel like indulging and ignoring calories.  Also, service was quite slow."}
{"text":"My husband, a fan of the Taylor's Made Right in Iowa, feels that their loose meat sandwich is good but does not compare to the original.   The Omelet was huge and good but nothing unique. The biscuit wasn't good enough to tempt me to eat the carbs. All in all, we would not seek it out but wouldn't be opposed to coming here if someone else wanted to dine here.    Service was very friendly!"}
{"text":"The wait is the first thing on the menu. Unless you are a Senior Citizen. If you a not, well. Just sit back and watch the waitresses serve them first. After waiting and watching others get served who came after me, I left. Interesting enough the young couple who we saw at the door showed up at the Applebee's 10 minutes later. If you are not a SC the only thing on the menu you can order is WAIT!"}
{"text":"I don't do reviews for 2 or 3 stars, but am making an exception here, because it's so complicated. Great quality home-made food, which should make this place an easy 5 stars. The management made the dining experience uncomfortable and down-right strange. I've never seen an owner/ manager behave the way this lady did. Go in, and see for yourself. It's very distracting and weird. If the service is slow, it's because it's under-staffed. The staff that is working seems to be doing all they can. Great food, unorthodox management style. If you own or manage a restaurant, it would be worth sending your new managers here as part of their training to simply observe what not to do as a manager."}
{"text":"I would like to thank all of our customers that came in today,  Feb. 24th, for all of their patients and understanding. I know it is the cafe's  responsibility to be fully staffed but today it was an unfortunate event.  I appreciate everyone's understanding and all of your encouragement and praise for the server.  Thanks again and hope to see you all again soon."}
{"text":"Unless you're 70 or older don't come here. They're very slow and if you're under 70 it seems they don't want you in there. They say on their menu they have fresh pie baked everyday... We went in for pie... She said they have Minnesota slop and Apple raisin... Wtf? Gross. I suggest going to village inn instead don't waste your time or money"}
{"text":"A mixed bag of goods and bads.  Their \"new\" location (at Higley and Brown) is a building formerly occupied by an Arby's; they moved in just after Christmas 2011, and you would think the new facility would be pretty spiffy because they would take time to fix it up so cute.  Not so!  It still looks like a tired and shabby Arby's, all scuffed up and untidy and frankly not very clean.  So, ambiance is a maybe a 2.  Now, prices are most reasonable, so for value I give them a 4+ rating, as in this economy, you want them to be easy on your wallet.  But, on the down side, the quality of what you get for a really low price is not so good, so my rating there is 1 1/2.  I took one of my pork chops home, but in the end just threw it out as it was tough, like leather.  Wait staff was great, attentive, and right on with answers, so I give them a 4.  The one saving grace amongst all these mixed ratings is certainly their PIE.  That, for sure, is a solid 5 stars and makes up for their lesser ratings.  I had their apple pie, um mm.  My wife had a different pie, and she ate it so fast I did not have a chance to sample it so I can't tell you what it was.  I hope the Iowa Cafe management continues to improve this place, and perhaps is will time to catch the rhythm of running a cafe."}
{"text":"Understaffed leads to horrible service on a busy weekend morning. Good was average, but it's breakfast so tough to screw up. The only thing reminiscent of Iowa is the decorations, the employees and service are a far cry from \"Midwest\"."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite breakfast places in Mesa! My grandpa used to take me here when I was younger and I've always love their biscuits and gravy, so delicious! Best gravy and their chicken fried steak is pretty tasty too. I told my bf he needed to try them out and so we made the drive out there and now he's a fan lol. It's always busy when I visit but I don't really mind. We only wait about 1-2minutes to get seated. The staff are so friendly and always make sure everything is going great. Food comes out fast and hot and the servers always make sure your drinks are never empty. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"A little breakfast spot that has the old dinner feel to it so if your looking for something of the more local downhome feel for breakfast versus a chain this is a good spot.   While it is nothing that is outstanding it will hit the spot if your looking for just a simple breakfast. I have had the corned beef hash and 2 eggs twice now and while it hasn't been anything that jumps out and screams \"come back for more\" it still hasn't stopped me from clearing my plate each time. However it has needed a kick of tabasco and some pepper. The pepper is because it is a little blander than i would like but the tabasco is just because i love spicy breakfast. The first time my eggs were a little overdone but not horrible and they were just fine the second.  If your somebody who prefers a mom and pop place over a chain like iHop this is a pretty good alternative and probably a better taste too."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. OMG it took over 45 minutes to get our food. Everyone around come in after and received there food before us. Not sure if the guy was new or not. But my order was completely wrong and not complete. I order the chicken salad sandwich on wheat bread with French fries. I receive chicken salad on white with potato salad. I wasn't going to dare say anything. I was so hungry. There was no I'm sorry or how did everything come out. I was very disappointed with this cafe. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Really good food but kind of slow getting food during lunch. I had the large pork cutlet sandwich or should I say huge!!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Open early with a friendly staff and regulars"}
{"text":"A locally owned Mesa gem, well-known to folks from the neighborhood including the friends of mine who introduced me. The most delicious pies in the world, my favorite being coconut cream. Awesome breakfast entrees. Really friendly staff who actually seem to be from Iowa. And an interior that actually does magically transport you back to a small-town diner in the middle of rural Iowa.   Eating here is simply a classic American dining experience from top to bottom."}
{"text":"What friendly happy people....Love the customer service.  The food was not great, matter of fact it was a bit disappointing.  However times are tough and these people are doing what they can to provide cheap filling food.  I had the breaded pork special and it was average.  Pies were well received and the smiles kept coming all night.   I will try this place again but I will stick with the breakfast menu that is served all day."}
{"text":"Iowa Cafe is one of those places I always saw and wished to stop but never did. Someone from our church had told us that it had reopened under new management and in a different location. Then, we heard other friends talk about it and said that it was good with a down-home feeling. Well, one Sunday after church my whole family decided to go there for lunch. We all liked it!!  My husband ordered the meat loaf and he said that it remainded him of back home (Ohio) so I guess that's good. The food option in the kids menu is good and super affordable. I ordered a small traditional breakfast with bacon and country potatoes that was good but also ordered  a cinnamon roll to share with everybody that it was amazing!! Just make sure you ask for it to nice and warm.   Overall, our first experience there has been nice. Service is great and super friendly!! We're definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I've been to this place. The first time was in their old location and we had a pretty bad experience and then we went again since they've moved and not much else has changed.  Welcome to death's waiting room ladies and gentleman! (hold for trumpets)  First of all this place is always packed so prepare to wait to sit.  Once seated expect to continue to wait forever for your food. We decided to sit at the breakfast bar where you have full access to the kitchen window, this was probably the best part of our experience - talk about entertainment. The waitresses are constantly stressed and do they bitch and moan- totally unprofessional.   After about 30 min. of watching \"the kitchen window movie\" we realized that we still hadn't gotten our food (we ordered simple dishes: 2 egg/hashbrowns  and I got a side of cinnamon bun french toast).    The person sitting next to us who came in long after was already eating.  When I asked what the deal was she said his meal was super simple that's why he got his before us. \"You two ordered omeletes right?\" Umm no we didn't...oh and  wait, stop, hold up...let me get this straight so people who order biscuits and gravy and french toast get to eat before people who order eggs and french toast? Well ok I'll make sure to get that next time then! Now that we know the secret our experience should be much better.  We finally got our food after 40 min and it was wrong.  (boo! I'm starving!)   After going through all of that the food was just ok. The homefries are good but the rest was sub par.  The \"homemade\" cinnamon roll they used for the french toast was chewy and dry and the ham my husband ordered looked a lot like spam meat to me.  After all the waiting and drama this place just isn't worth it.    I should note that our waitress was very nice and did a pretty good job even though she was slammed but I bet it was b/c we were literally  sitting in her face at the breakfast bar and even in that location we never got a refill on our waters or coffee...ok so never mind she wasn't good either.  She did comp some of my meal which was a nice gesture though I would have demanded that if she didn't offer anyway.  Additional Tip: For all you omelete eaters out there, they cook them then microwave them before they're served. I'm really not a fan of microwaved eggs so I thought I'd pass that nugget along.  Sitting in front of the Kitchen window can certainly be enlightening...and gross."}
{"text":"After dining at Iowa Cafe for over 20+ years I, along with my extended family & friends, will no longer frequent this establishment. I have had 3 disappointing visits in a row. It is apparent Iowa Cafe has lost its ambience and graciousness to its customers. Reading the other reviews on here I see others feel the same way. The current employees are destroying the image of the cafe which in turn results in loyal clientele no longer wanting to dine there again.   I came last week with 2 of my friends. Sat down for lunch at around 11:00am. Beverages served right away. Only one other table was in there waiting for their food. 3 other tables had already eaten and were finishing up. We ordered around 11:05am. Another table sat down beside us. 10 minutes passed by. My side salad was served. By 11:35 still no food. The table after us was served their food. Their entrees pretty much matched our selections . So why were they served first? Why didn't a waitress come to our table during this whole time and check on us? We would have liked to have refills beverages and updated about our food. My empty salad bowl and empty iced tea glass remained ignored for at least 10 minutes. It wasn't as if the 2 waitresses were busy by all means. I noticed our waitress went outside twice to smoke while we were sitting there. When she came back in from smoking and touching the front entrance door handle she never washed her hands. She was also playing with her cell phone a lot. Which I know has to be filthy too. Needless to say, with the wait, the feel of being ignored, and the disgust of our waitress's filthy hands we decided to leave. I did put down $8.00 on the table for the 3 iced teas and side salad. I'm sure that money never made it to the cash register. As we were leaving, the waitresses good and well knew we were leaving disappointed, acknowledged our movement and said in a sarcastic voice \"Thank you! Enjoy your day!\". This confirmed to me that this was no longer the Iowa Cafe that my entire family would gather to for special lunches over the years. The cafe my grandmother enjoyed the Giant Pork Tenderloin and the cafe my grandfather use to compare the Country Fried Steak to my grandmother's is now tainted with heavily tattooed and disrespectful employees. I can go on and mention the other last 2 bad experiences. One with my father that he never got to eat and the other with my mother where it took over an hour to have lunch with being the only table there. But I think I have expressed enough with what I have shared so far. I tried to reach out to the owner to share my experiences before writing this review. Five days have passed without contact.  I can no longer recommend this restaurant. If comfort food is what you are looking for these types of diners are a dime a dozen in this area of Mesa. You can Google or Yelp the word \"diner\" and find a restaurant that truly values your patronage."}
{"text":"For those of you looking for a diner with Mid-West prices, portions and hospitality, this is it!  I went there not knowing what to expect and found the plates to be packed to the edges, the service to be just enough without being pushy or disruptive and the check to be well within reason!  I will definitely e returning in the near future."}
{"text":"My neighbor at the senior mobile home park has been telling me how good the Iowa Cafe is. I figure she should know since she's from Iowa. I'm from the Midwest with lots of Indiana roots so I grew up eating pork tenderloin and always eat a lot of it when I go back to the Midwest for visits so I had looked forward to coming to the Iowa Cafe for the same kind of food.   My daughter and I tried to come here one night a couple weeks earlier after my grandson's Awards ceremony nearby. Yelp had them listed as being open until 7 p.m. but when we got there we saw signs on the door announcing their hours were now only until 1 p.m. (I notified Yelp and they have since corrected the hours). When Mother's Day rolled around and we wanted to have an early lunch together I suggested the Iowa Cafe again because it was near the church she attends. We were both very happy with our meal. She got an omelet breakfast and I got the pork tenderloin plate. Unfortunately we were both having tummy problems that morning, apparently unrelated from activities and foods the day before, so we were happy to find basic unspicy food available.   The Pork Tenderloin was tender and they gave me a good portion for the price. The pork gravy was especially good. The mashed potatoes tasted homemade. I was very happy with the green beans which were prepared like an old fashioned green bean casserole using mushroom soup. I'm not sure I've ever been in a restaurant that serves them like this even though it's one of the easiest recipes you could make. The whole meal was down home and excellent. I was too full for dessert but couldn't resist the temptation of pecan pie on the menu so I ordered a piece to take home. It wasn't as good as my mother's. Few pies in restaurants and bakeries are. But I still enjoyed it. I wish they didn't close so early since I'm not a morning person but I do want to come back here someday when the opportunity presents itself. I saw other things on the menu I'm sure I would enjoy.   The only thing that was lacking was the service which was surprisingly unenergetic considering it was Mother's Day. A surprising amount of time went by between when we were seated and when someone finally came by to take our order and it took quite a while for the food to come out also. Our waitress was cheerful at the end and finally wished us a happy Mother's Day which we heard waitresses wishing other people the whole time we were there. I had to share my water with my daughter when they didn't come back to refill hers. I just figured a down-home cafe would have friendlier more attentive service to lure people back. You would have thought they would have been crazy busy mid day on Mother's Day but the place was only half-full which made the lackluster service more surprising since they weren't overloaded with customers, at least not when we were there.  After writing this I started reading other reviews and see that service has been a problem for other customers also."}
{"text":"We are from Iowa so we thought it would be fun to go to the Iowa cafe. It was charming with the Iowa souvenirs. Wait staff very friendly. I ordered the Iowa tenderloin and upgraded to jumbo. We received it in a reasonable amount of time, started eating then was told we got the wrong order and someone else got our jumbo. Waitress told us we would get a piece of pie to compensate for the mistake. Ok, that was fine. But when we got the bill we still had to pay for jumbo. I was disappointed. I thought I would only pay for regular since that is what I received and pie was comped for the mistake. Anyway the tenderloin was good. I would go back again but would send back any mistake they made."}
{"text":"The food here stinks! I will never go back again! Don't waste your time and money there are other restaurants with better quality food!"}
{"text":"The tenderloin is fantastic as are the briskets and gravy.  However i have lived in the area for almost 30 years and the little old store on McKellips was much better than what they have now.   Since the owner sold out a few years ago and the new owner took over and moved to the current location the service has bombed and the prices have skyrocketed. Being from Iowa I still go there for the tenderloins once in awhile but nothing like I used to."}
{"text":"To be fair I have only eaten breakfast here but have been back again and again and again.  The portions are large, the food is good and hearty and the 4 egg omelets are the best anywhere.  Fluffy, always cooked to perfection and delicious.  The other day I had the chicken friend steak for breakfast with eggs and gravy it too was wonderful.  The restaurant used to be in a different location.  They have recently moved to the Higley location and the place is spotless and with all new everything.  It is always busy or almost full but because the service is good people move in and out and we have never had a problem getting a table.  From my perspective this place is just an awesome breakfast stop, a place you can go every weekend.  The staff is friendly and nice, the owner is always around greeting people and being accessible.  Good work and thanks for being in Mesa where places like this one are few and far between."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a few years only because I live kind of far from it and when I do have the time to get there it's on the weekends for breakfast and then I'll have driven a long way just to wait for about 20 minutes to get a table.  When I have eaten here the food has always been decent. The breakfast is typical eggs and bacon. I would definitley recommend getting a slice of pie and a home made donut."}
{"text":"Don't like.  Cramped. The help is rude and loud. The waitress dressed like a tramp and the food was average.  Loud TVs.  Too many people.  Heard the waitresses personal life to other staff.  Won't go back. Like ever ever again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast with my husband on a Saturday morning. The place was moderately busy. We were seated and our drink orders were taken. Afyer reviewing rhe menu, I decided on the two egg breakfast. This comes with two eggs, cooked any style, homefries, and toast. I chose my eggs yo be cooked over hard, and whole wheat toast with no butter, and Orange Juice. While waiting for our food to arrive, we admired the Midwestern theamed decor, and being Midwesterners ourselves, we related to most of it.  When our waitress brought our plates of breakfast yumminess, we got to work eating. My eggs were cooked perfectly, the homefries were crispy and tasty, and my unbuttered toast was toasted to the perfect toastiness! While eating my husband noticed they offer a variety of pies. When our waitress btought by our check, we asked if they had Michigan four-berry pie(being a midwestern cafe, I thought maybe...) she said they did not...we talked for a bit about the amazingness that is a four bery pie, paud our bill and left. Overall this was a good experience, and we will be back to try other options on their menu."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast we  loved it! Will return for sure.. Homemade Corned Beef Hash & he had an omelet... Yummy!"}
{"text":"Pork tenderloin sandwiches to Iowa is like lobster is to Maine.  It is the state food.  But it is hard to find good tenderloin sandwiches in far away places like Arizona.  Fortunately, The Iowa Cafe supplies the tenderloin sandwiches that Iowa retirees in Arizona crave.  We were not disappointed.  Good stuff.  (The pies, on the other hand, were not particularly good, so stick with the tenderloin sandwiches.)"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 17 people for lunch.  We got there at 11:45am.  We asked for 2-3 minutes to decide on our orders.  The waitress did not come back for about 20 min.  We had to flag down a different waitress to get help.  After placing our orders, it took over an hour until the food started coming out.  During this whole time, our waitress did not once come to our table.  No updates on the order, no apologies for the delay.  There was no apology at all during the whole visit.  Other patrons came in and left before our food even came.  I have never experienced such slow service before.  The second set of patrons were waiting a long time too as everyone was waiting for our order to be completed.  The food was good, but not worth the wait.    I would have understood if the service was just a little slow, but it was REALLY slow and receiving no feedback over the course of an hour and no apology whatsoever prohibits me from giving more than one star."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, slow service... My wife and I went to lunch and it took forever to get a cheeseburger and a salad."}
{"text":"Had pork chops dry over cooked briquettes pkg gravy left nasty taste in mouth, not good"}
{"text":"We went to their new location this morning (they have moved to the SE corner of Higley & Brown, behind Applebee's).  We went right at primetime on Sunday morning, so it was busy/crowded.  We were so put off by the behavior of the hostess/owner, that we just left:  1)  When we first arrived, we entered through the first set of doors, which leads into a very, very small waiting area that has a second set of doors into the dining area.  People were crammed everywhere into this little waiting area.  The hostess (which I believe was also an owner) was windexing the little windows on the 2nd set of doors, which prevented us from entering the restaurant!  At 9am on a busy Sunday morning, in March in Arizona (it doesn't get any more prime time than that!).  Apparently this task cannot be done at a slower time when people will not be inconvenienced.  So there we are, trapped in this tiny little waiting area, in everyone's way, and we can't move - she is not stopping her cleaning to let us in.  When my wife goes to open the door, the hostess gives her a look like \"wait till I'm done!\".  Finally the hostess/owner finishes her little windexing chore and we enter the restaurant to put our names in.  2)  Before putting our names on the list, I ask this same snotty hostess/owner \"how long is the wait?\" and she replies, \"don't worry, the tables turn fast, it won't be long\".  I ask a second time, she says again, \"not long\".  She won't tell me how long!  So I respond, \"more or less than 20 minutes?\" and she says \"about that\" in a very unconvincing way.    So at that point, we were out of there, totally put-off and annoyed.  I have always heard the food was very average, but we were in the area and thought we'd try it out.  This behavior however, was unbelievable.  If they are making so much money that they do not have to treat customers properly, then good for them.  They need me more than I need them, and I will not give my hard-earned money to a business that acts as if I'm doing them a favor by showing up.  I will never set foot in this place again, and I will tell as many people as I can about my experience."}
{"text":"Fried pork tenderloin sandwich!!! If your from the Midwest you know what I'm talking about. That is the only thing I've had here and it's the best I have found in the PHX area after looking for 5 years."}
{"text":"This place is just like a small town diner.  Every small town I have been to has a little place like this where the locals eat.   I found Iowa Cafe using my Yelp Blackberry App after finishing a hearing at the East Mesa Justice Court.  The restaurant itself is a small and old fashioned in a 1970's midwest kind of way, but it was clean.  My waitress was friendly and she took my order and delivered my food without any delay.  I had the corned beef hash, over easy eggs, and rye toast.  The breakfast was hot and delicious, but very traditional.  There was no artistic license taken with the food.   My meal was ridiculously inexpensive.  Don't come here looking for healthy options on the menu.  There are no egg-white omelets or low-carb wraps.  My breakfast really stuck to my ribs, though, and I did not get hungry again until almost dinner time."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years, both the old location and now the new. The new is much more open and airy. Sometimes busy, but food is consistent and always good. Love their fried potatoes and omelettes."}
{"text":"Leaving one star because zero is not an option! Left after watching a roach crawl across the counter toward the open display of pies"}
{"text":"Comfort food lives here! The Breaded Pork Tenderloin & Eggs \"Special\" that we tried today was wonderful - I really liked their fried potato slices too. The decor here is a tribute to Iowa. Amy being from Iowa, we thought it was kind of cute. If I owned the place - I'd invest heavily in landscaping to make it look like Iowa on the outside too.  FYI - They always have a Breaded Pork Tenderloin sandwich on the menu. Next time!"}
{"text":"The kids convinced me to come back here to get the pie that they have been craving and I wasn't wanting to go after the last visit but I did.  Very glad that I did.  The pie is amazing and the breakfast was also fantastic.  I don't know what happened but I have to say it was all as good as we experienced at the old location.  You must have the pie regardless of when you visit.  Pie is good for breakfast, lunch or dinner here."}
{"text":"Good place to go when visiting your grandparents from the midwest.  grandma and grandpa will love it because the waitress knows exactly how grandpa likes his oatmeal!  You'll tolerate it because you see the waitress being nice to your grandparents.  Cinnamon rolls were pretty good!"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what you expect.  Tables in every nook of the drawn out building means plenty of seating.  The kitchen is quick and the servers are pretty good (but lack any charming personality).  The place has all sorts of random junk you can buy if you are into buying postcards at your breakfast stop.  It is a decent experience.  Where it gets me down is the food.  I ordered my typical Texas Toast french toast and it was beyond boring.  The pieces were small and had no hint of extra flavoring.  The syrup was bland and tasted store-bought.    What I wanted was home-cooked goodness for breakfast.  What I got was cookie-cutter blandness.  Too bad, this coulda been a great place."}
{"text":"Decided to try out this place for breakfast. Going in we were greeted immediately and taken to a booth. It's definitely old and outdated but it's clean. Our food was good but the iced tea is not brewed it's from the fountain. The biggest complaint I had was the price. $28 for 2 diner quality breakfasts. I had corned beef hash and tea, my husband got French  toast with bacon and coffee and OJ."}
{"text":"Went out for breakfast on a Sunday morning and decided to give the Iowa cafe another try.  We were sat and ignored.  Other patrons came in, sat, water and drinks served and still no one came by.  We waited ten minutes and walked out.   Done with this place."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast hangout ... You have to try their new Eggs Benedict. Yum! I love the Iowa hometown feel where the servers know your name and care about you."}
{"text":"Garbage.  I went to this place a few years ago and really enjoyed it.  The food was excellent diner food and I was especially fond of their homemade corned beef hash.  If I would have reviewed it a year ago it would have been 4 stars.... but something has changed.  I visited again a week ago with a serious craving for corned beef hash.  Unfortunately, everything was different, and in a bad way.  It wasn't even the same recipes.  My dining partner's omelet wasn't anything to brag about either.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good classic breakfast food! Love the Iowa vibe.  Brings me back home to sit at a counter and sip coffee from an Iowa Hawkeyes mug."}
{"text":"I have been there for breakfast many times. Busy place. The service and the food has always been good.   It is a must place to go. I bring or meet friends and family. Parking is never ending."}
{"text":"Iowa, the 29th state. Iowa Caf√© the best home-style breakfast place in Mesa. I'm a Midwesterner, and this is down on the farm good home cooking. The caf√© is decorated in everything Iowa. They have pennants from probably every college in the state not to mention the giant Hawkeye banner on the wall. The menu has all the farm fresh favorites. I ordered the corned beef omelet with onions, peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, and cheese. This came with sides of toast and home fries. The eggs in the omelet were light and fluffy. the corned beef and vegetables were cooked to perfection. A rather large portion. The home fries were deep fried not skillet fried which made for an even golden brown color and a surprising crispiness.  The food was great, the service was good, and the total bill with coffee $15.10. This is the best mid-west breakfast I've had in Mesa."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast.  Ordered two eggs, corned beef hash, and toast.  It was okay.  I do not know if this would be considered \"Iowan\" style.  I am originally from the Northwestern corner of Illinois, on the Iowa border.  I do not know if I would call it \"Iowa\" style.  The food was okay."}
{"text":"Being originally from Iowa this place was spot on! They had the Midwest hospitality that no place out here has! The pork tenderloin tastes just like home! Service was amazing and all the staff were spot on! Will definitely return here!!"}
{"text":"Reminded me of home. Good food. Service was a little slow but in the Midwest people don't rush so gave you even more that Midwest experience."}
{"text":"We started out intending to go to the local IHOP but they had a line out the door. We came across Iowa Cafe right across the street and decided to give it a try. It was a good choice. We walked in and it was packed. We were seated within a couple minutes. All of us ordered an omelette. It came with potatoes and choice of bread.   I chose an English muffin. They advertise \"fluffy\" omelette's. It was delicious and filling. Didn't finish everything because I didn't want to be stuffed. The staff is friendly. Service was good. I even enjoyed watching the football game that was on the huge tv right in front of us. I would recommend for breakfast. We all enjoyed our food."}
{"text":"The worse breakfast place for kids they don't let you sit in booth if you need high chair they say it's health code which I know it's not then what breakfast restaurant does not off box cereal for kids wow 1 breakfast and 2 kids pancakes $30 lmao I will stick with wild berry but they were closed today"}
{"text":"Best not to go close to closing. We arrived 1/2 hour before closing and were the only patrons. They rushed us through ordering & eating. The turkey sandwich was unremarkable.  No garnish,  looked naked on the large plate all by itself. The website's hours aren't correct."}
{"text":"Ok....so I'm sad for the 3 stars because of the potential  of this place. We were greeted immediately and sat down at a nice booth. We put in our drink order right away but this is where the promptness ended. Like, slam on the brakes ended. Ridiculously ended. Tyler was the server and was very sweet. We ordered an iced t, a milkshake and a cocktail so we weren't surprised by the wait until it was literally 30 minutes later when we got them. We asked a couple times where our drinks were and he just kept saying \"one sec\". Our food came out before our drinks. We had the split pea soup, which was delicious, a fried pork tenderloin sandwich and it was plenty to share and corned beef and hash. All came out as ordered and nice and hot. Still, no drinks. Im getting super irritated at this point but Tyler was really trying and the other server on was absolutely no help. Its a small cafe style place and if there was teamwork in place, I feel like they would be more successful at making things run more smoothly. She just kept yelling at him to get his food out of the window etc....I would hate working with her as she just helped in his getting futher behind which as you can guess, is horrible for business. We also ordered a piece of the cyclone pie with cherries and peaches and vanilla ice cream. Very good and not too hot. The bill for all that was 42 bucks so not bad on that, either. All in all, I would check this place out again."}
{"text":"The Iowa Cafe isn't amazing, but it's a decent choice for breakfast in Northeast Mesa.   I'm not a huge breakfast fan in general, but I do enjoy their biscuits and gravy. They're about as close to homemade as possible. The menu seems pretty typically Midwestern. Portions are large and the fare is very hearty.   Service is pretty hit and miss. During the winter it's packed with snowbirds-but what isn't in this neighborhood?- and wait times can be lengthy."}
{"text":"sometimes the wait sucks, but the food is awesome. The amount of food for the price is well worth it"}
{"text":"My Parents and I have been coming to this place for years. Especially before they changed their location (near/on McKellips Rd. & Recker). Today was the first worst service that my friend and I have received. Maybe the girl/hostess didn't intentionally try to give me and attitude, but I feel like there's a certain way to greet and speak to people when they enter a restaurant.  First off, I arrived before my friend got there. Since My Parents and I have always went there to eat breakfast, I talked up the place; saying it was one of the best places to have brunch. I got excited for him to try the food (since he's always down to try new hole-in-the-wall restaurants. He took an Uber from Tempe to this location; I told him he would not be sorry.  So when I arrived, the hostess/waitress with a good sized tattoo on her arm didn't really greet me. Only said \"One of you?\" I responded with \"Yeah, and there will be another person arriving.\" She said \"Okay\" and walked away. I saw a few empty tables and wondered if I should have sat myself down, but I really didn't want to disregard the \"Please wait to be seated\" sign. So I kept my eyes on her to see if she would wave me over.   She continued to assist customers that we already seated and I really didn't mind waiting. I just wished she would have said \"Please wait a minute\" or \"I'll seat you in just a second.\" Then I wouldn't be left waiting or disappointed (I hate being brushed off). So I waited, watching her run herself around the restaurant.  She went back behind the counter and then walked out and rudely walked across in front of me with no \"Excuse me.\" If we were vehicles and she ran a red light, I would have T-boned her. She was that close to me reaching for menus next to the counter that I was standing next to. I shook my head at her like \"Geez. I could have moved if you said 'Excuse me.'\"   So she grabbed the menus and walked to a table booth area without saying anything. So I stood there watching her put the menus on the table, with her looking back at me like 'Duh, follow me.' At this point, I'm wondering if it's that hard to politely ask the customer to follow you to the next available table? I sat down with her saying nothing to me of course.   I knew right then that if she was in fact going to be my waitress, I would request another one. So while I was waiting for my friend to arrive, I drank my first beverage brought by another waitress which I hoped would be better, but it seemed like she was being very forgetful. She forgot/lost the ticket that belong to the couple that were seated next to me. Then, I didn't pay it no mind.  When my friend arrived, we looked over the menu, and then our waitress arrived. She took down our beverages (including my second beverage) and order, we chatted for a good while until we both noticed that we never received our beverages. We would have flagged her down but she never came around our area until she brought our meals, including our missing beverages. It's not too big of a deal. We just noticed that we never got our beverages while we waited.  Overall, the food was good as always; my friend would agree. He didn't experience the rudeness upon my arrival, which is good because, he'd probably would never want to return if he got there before me.   If they were new waitresses, they'd get a pass. But if you've been in the restaurant business for a couple weeks or months, please be a lot more polite, aware and acknowledge your customers. And also, communicate. Don't just walk off and ignore, but at the same time expect us people to catch on. You have to speak up and let us know what's going on. We don't run the place.  Next time, I expect better."}
{"text":"In terms of food, I would really only give this place a 3 star rating because I didn't find it to be particularly wonderful.  However, I loved the setup of the menu that let you order as little or as much as you like without having to break the bank by ordering everything a la carte.  The place is fairly small and tucked away in a place you might miss if you were driving by, but they have a pretty big sign out front.  It was a seat yourself kind of deal and the server came by pretty quickly to take our drink order.   While waiting for drinks I was able to observe the eclectic and not entirely cohesive crap all over the walls and on the shelves.  I didn't quite understand why some stuff was on the walls, but to each his own.  The restaurant seemed a wee bit dirty but it didnt really bother me one bit.  For breakfast I ordered 2 buckwheat pancakes, an egg, and some bacon.  The egg was cooked just the way I like it, with the edges of the white nice and crispy.  The bacon was fine, but nothing special.  The pancakes were enormous and entirely too much food for me.  They were pretty tasty, but a little on the dry side for my taste.  The East Valley is lucky to have such a nice alternative to the usual suspects for breakfast."}
