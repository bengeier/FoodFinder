{"text":"Truly amazing experience. Highly recommended. The food is good and cheap, all the pho are less than 10$ with tax for large size, and it is more than enough to become full. The service is great too. Good place to chill with friends. Highly recommended their all dressed soup, since it has a bit of everything. The boeuf saignant pho is good too."}
{"text":"Good place if you're looking for a well-balanced \"bun bo hue\"! However, this is one of the most unattractive places in town! Read more on http://theforbiddenmeal.com/2014/11/16/a-hidden-vietnamese-restaurant-in-ville-st-laurent/"}
{"text":"Quaint mall restaurant with delicious pho tonkinese soup.   Excellent price and size of soup bowl.   Service slow but worth the wait.   Would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"well tried there caramalise fish not what we expected
very very salty like salt flavor  and like piss and mud taste 
hot and sour soupe broth good but not sure or spicy"}
{"text":"Best pho place in montreal! Their bun bo hue is the best its very flavorful and their pho is very good too. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Must order Bun Bo Hue (Beef Spice Noodle)! Our server is efficient, the price is reasonable. The only thing is their imperial rolls. They are too small. We had to order 6 of them!"}
{"text":"If you don't take in mind the decor and just concentrate on the food this is a good place. The pho is good and so are the grillades. Service is friendly. Taste of the food has always been consistent from one time to the next. Go to place for a quick bite when I'm around."}
{"text":"Since this is in the neighborhood, my family tends to eat here a lot. They have really authentic pho, unlike certain restaurants who lack in flavor. You could fill yourself up with $15; super affordable! 

However, I've stopped coming here because the past 4 visits, I've found multiple hairs in my food. I'll probably come back later and give it another shot to see if things get better; perhaps wearing a hair net! 

It's a shame because this was my to-go pho joint. I want to eat your pho; not your hair!"}
{"text":"Very good value restaurant. Being in Montreal, we have the luxury to have access to a wide array of different cuisines from all around the world. That being said, there are no shortage of Vietnamese restaurants in Montreal. Pho restaurants can be found at almost any neighbourhood, with different ranges of quality and price.

This restaurant is arguably one of the good deals on a bowl of Pho. Here, you can get the XL size, named the \"train\" size in Vietnamese, for 9$, tax in. Usually, that size would be around 12-13$ tax in in other Pho restaurants. The flavor, however, is not the best, neither the worst I've tasted. I would say average overall. The portions are good and filling. Service is definitely not a highlight, as it usually goes for asian restaurants.

A bonus, there are always parking spots as it is located in a local shopping mall.

Overall, a great place to get your pho fix on a budget!"}
{"text":"Cha Gio (imperial rolls/spring rolls):
Mediocre. They were small, with hardly any filling resulting in minimal flavours. The texture was just right though. Had a perfect amount of crispiness that added well to the bun bo hue I had with it

Bun bo hue (spicy beef vermicelli noodle soup from hue):
Again mediocre at best. Ive read many reviews suggesting that this place would have an exceptional bowl of bun bo hue and was mildly disappointed. I found the broth to be lacking depth and spice. I ordered an extra large portion, and was also quite disappointed by how little bun (vermicelli/noodles) I felt like I received in the bowl, however they did put in quite a bit meat. In my opinion the meat:noodle ratio was off point, BUT you should also note that an XL bowl here costs less than a lot of other places (probably the cheapest) and that at that price for portion it is indeed good.

Ca phe sua da (vietnamese iced coffee):
I ordered this last while leaving and figured I would perhaps have to wait another 5 minutes or so for it to be prepared. I was wrong. Although the restaurant had hardly any customers inside, it turned out they pre-drip the coffees. Now I know there are a lot of places that do follow this practice, but nonetheless I figured \"hardly anyone we'll make it fresh\". In any case, I did not have high expectations for the coffee and behold....I WAS WRONG. It was quite nice. Very rich in flavour. However, the amount of coffee you get is less than half of the take out cup. The whole cup is filled with ice with only 1/4 of coffee filled (as shown in photos)

The 3 items i ordered came up to be about $15. For the extremely cheap price, I would probably come back and try their pho (also read good reviews) and possibly order \"extra noodles\"."}
{"text":"As we do most Sundays, my family and I go there to have a delicious bowl of pho or of bun bo hue. On the good side, the food was yummy and tasty. On the other hand, the customer service was so-so. They don't seem very patient and they kept interrupting us while we were ordering our food. Otherwise, thumbs up to the food!"}
{"text":"Delicious bun bo hue. The grilled chicken vermicelli is good. The pork and beef are tasty but the meats are fondue meats so... A bit stingy. The red bean drink is delicious but small."}
{"text":"I've been going to that mall to do my groceries for so long and I've never seen this place until I read the reviews. Non-expensive, good and fast! This will be my place whenever I feel like eating Tonkinoise soup."}
{"text":"Do not let the \"decor\" or the place fool you. For me, I was pleasantly surprised! Ok, the menu was kinda sticky and the place kinda sketchy but the food was really good! The service was friendly and fast. Nothing was to be complained about with the food. Generous portions if meat vs. the ration of noodles and broth. Prices were more then reasonable. It is kinda out of the ordinary that this place is in a \"cheap\" kind of shopping mall. I would of never known of its existence if it weren't for my auntie :)

I rarely come to ville st-laurent but will make a stop here when around!"}
