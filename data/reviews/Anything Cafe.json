{"text":"Love it!  We live nearby so it is very convenient to pick up for a quick lunch or supper.  Excellent #50, spring rolls and salad rolls with great, friendly service.  A welcomed addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"To be fair, I have only been once and I had a sub.  It was fantastic. This is exactly the type of place that  you want in your neighbourhood.  Fresh, fast and privately run.  Not sure you can beat the prices.  I will be there often assuming that the quality and pricing sticks.  If you live in Marda Loop, go and support them."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible! 
Called for a pick up order which said would be ready in 15-20 minutes, when I got there it my Order wasn't even started! I waited while he made my food . Spring rolls, salt & pepper squid and a chicken sub. 
The he forgot the food in the fryer, the rolls were burnt, squid dry and tasteless, and sub bun was burnt to a crisp! And meat was just fat. And still served it to me!! 
Terrible!! 
Waste of money, food is garbage and will never be back. I do not recommend to anyone!!"}
