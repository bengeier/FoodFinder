{"text":"Food was OK. I ordered the Baked Mac and Cheese dinner and it was super oily, a bit on the bland side of taste. The whole dinner tasted super oily. And I guess their business hours changed on Saturday, menu stated it was 11Am/9Pm - The woman on the phone while exceptionally polite corrected me and said it was 8 PM. Will I order from this location again - maybe. Just not the Mac and Cheese dinner."}
{"text":"I got take out specialty pizzas and salads from here the other day for a small group.  The girl who took my order over the phone was sort of underwhelming and it's sort of weird that you order at a register but the pizza was very good. I'll definitely get it again."}
{"text":"If there's one reason I'm upset I don't work in Beachwood anymore, it's because I can't hit up Tomaydo Tomahhdo for lunch.  This is a great place to pick up quick food that's really tasty!  The menu has a ton of options so there's something for everyone, but I will say that the salads and pizza are THE BEST!  The left coast chicken salad (oh I was so ticked when they took this off the menu - rest assured, it's back by popular demand (their exact words)) and the spinach florentine pizza are my absolute FAVES!  The chicken pesto is also worth trying out.    The dining area is small, so I would suggest this place as more of a to-go type of meal.  Hey, if you're not in the mood to cook then let these pros do it for you - you'll be very satisfied (especially if you're accident prone in the kitchen like me!)"}
{"text":"Had dinner here two nights ago 5:00. No one else in there. We both ordeted soup and tuna sandwiches. Took 45 minutes for them to prepare our tuna sandwiches because they forgot to make them. I had to go remind them. Their excuse was printer broken. Really? Only us two customers,chef,and other kitchen guy in whole place. Couldn't just tell him the order? Tuna sandwiches slothered wirh way too much mayo. Tomato soup was tasty. Don't get tuna sandwich! And don't go if you're in a hurry!"}
{"text":"This is the VERY BEST TOMATO SOUP I HAVE EVER HAD, WOW!!!!! The flatbread pizza is excellent too!! I came in from out of town and wanted something good so thought id give it a shot. And if I'm ever back I will make it a point to come here again. They made the pizza right in front of me in a brick oven too which I thought was pretty cool."}
{"text":"Awesome friendly clean nice place and great food!! Great service!!! Awesome soup!!! Was great to find a great value like this!!! Thanks Charles!!!"}
{"text":"This is like a smaller, less frenzied version of Panera, except instead of bread being their main attraction, it's tomaydohs. Er, tomatoes.  There is plenty to choose from on the menu, including salads that were actually delicious (I had the Seattle Walnut), sandwiches, soups (two choices - their \"signature\" tomato basil and a soup of the day), and flatbread pizzas.  Of course, they have one of those \"choose two\" options. Duh. Who doesnt?  They have Dr. Pepper AND Diet Dr. Pepper on tap. Shout out to Amy T!"}
{"text":"The service is very bad, I was double charged and to get it fixed I need to talk them twice and they don't have any regrets for their mistake. I felt the taste of the pizza(Spinach Florentine) is not that great, and Tomaydo Soup is ok. I felt food is over priced."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Amazing food. Had a South of the boarder pizza, and it was just amazing. Cant wait to try more."}
{"text":"Good food but everytime we go, the food takes forever to come out. By \"forever\" I mean longer than most traditional sit-down restaurants with a server. As I write this review we have waited over 20 minutes with only one family in front of us."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here and there was only 1 person working here , I guess  there was a call off so the food to ok a little longer  than usual  but the manager came in told us the food was  on the house for the inconvenience. Everything  was delicious  and the staff was very  friendly."}
{"text":"Great lunch option.  Pretty big menu for a fast casual restaurant.  The menu features flatbread pizza, soup, delicious salads and very good sandwiches.  I had the grilled turkey melt with white cheddar, bacon and chipotle mayo on ciabatta and it was very good.  I like that they offer fresh fruit as a side."}
{"text":"I adore this place! We went tonight after dreaming about their veggie lasagna for months! It lived up to my expectations and so much more! There is always enough for two meals. Their garlic bread is amazing and the Caesar salad is quite wonderful as well. My husband had the chili and a BBQ chicken flat bread. Both were good as well. Service was friendly, personalized and timely.  The best part? We were leaving near closing time, so the manager handed us two divine, rich red velvet cupcakes with the most delightful cream cheese frosting! Yum!!! They definitely made this girls day!!! Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"The food is always good. This is my first time at this location. I normally go to the one Downtown. It was very disappointing to see ONLY 2 people staffed on a Friday! Which made it difficult waiting on people, preparing food and taking phone calls. Unfortunately I was trying to call my order in but I was left on hold for 10 minutes. By then I was at the location placing my order in person so I hung up the phone. One thing I will say is that it didn't take them long to make my pizza. So the two stars is basically due to the fact that they were short-staffed."}
{"text":"Tomaydo Tomahhdo has some good food, but there are some things about this restaurant that prevent me from giving it more stars.  They have some inconsistencies in their food and it is a bear to wait in the line while they take phone orders.    That being said, for the price you will be hard pressed in this area to find better food in general.  That, and they deliver which is a huge plus to people working in an office.  The salads are pretty good, pizza and calzones are tasty and I do like the chips (only when they are fresh, so be sure to ask!!)"}
{"text":"Each item had a unique flavor and a burst of color. Super friendly owner and great staff. Mayfield Heights location has a neat kids area, flat screen televisions and ample seating. Menu has an array of delicious choices. The tomato basil soup is made from scratch every day and the bread comes delivered and baked fresh every day by Western Reserve Bakery. I'm recommending this place to everyone. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here for lunch today at work. Not even a large order and they literally screwed everything up. Most sandwiches didn't even have toppings, they forgot a a salad. Then, they decided combine two of the orders instead of sending them separately. Then, the replacement items were ALSO wrong. This place has seriously gone downhill over the years. We will never order here again."}
{"text":"Great when you dine in! Counter service for orders, but they bring it to the table. Love the pizza oven and what it does for the crust.   I've stopped trying delivery as the up charge, min order restrictions and loss of quality are all factors."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! I used to go to the one on the west side but it was closed due to lack of customers. Seriously, I don't know why, it's so good. I really like the buffalo sandwich or the Cesar salad. Too bad it's not as close to me, or else I would be here all the time!"}
{"text":"I've been there a few times and have found it to be consistently good.  Each time, we and our associates enjoyed our meals and we got out for a very reasonable price.  In particular, the salad assortment was nicely varied and the serving sizes were abundant.   All in all, I think it's a good value for what you pay and I recommend it.  There is no waitress service at the table, however - you order at the register and they bring your order to the table.  Of course, that also eliminates tipping, making it even more economical."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while.  About 1 year ago and past, I loved the pizza (nice & thick) and peanut slaw (it was spicy & had peanuts & maybe oil but definitely no mayo). About 6 months ago the pizza was fine but the peanut slaw had mayo...I ordered  my usual pizza a few days ago (week of Oct. 13, 2014) & slaw.  The pizza was as thin as a cracker. That is not an exaggeration...The peanut slaw had no peanuts, lots of mayo, maybe a bit of sugar. I was glad it was still spicy...I'm guessing new ownership but the man at counter denied it..."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I used to go to the wesgate location and haven't been to Tomaydo Tomahhdo in years and after my encounter today I won't be returning. food is WAY over priced for the service and the quality of the restaurant. The staff was short and rude. The restaurant was dirty I had to stare at dirty plates and tables for my entire meal (which took forever to receive) Not to mention mine and my nieces meal was completely cold by the time it reached our table. My nephew got a kids meal and didn't get the crayons and paper or milk until AFTER HE received his meal.. The whole restaurant and staff seems to need an upgrade. Staring at paper menus that are fastened to the ceiling un-even, bent, and ripped is not pleasant. I will not be returning nor recommending this establishment. This place is a complete joke."}
{"text":"Food was great. Their pepperoni pizza tastes like a nicer version of Chuckie Cheese's. My husbands pizza was also very good.  They are lacking in atmosphere though. It feels a bit dull. Service wasn't too bad but it wasn't fast either. My toddler slept the whole time we were waiting but had he been awake it would've been a bit stressful for us."}
{"text":"The young lady that took our order was not the sharpest tool in the shed.  She didn't ask me what kind of dressing I wanted for my salad and served my salad to me with no dressing.  Then she wasn't around to ask for it so I had to ask the other women there who seemed to be the manager was healpful with that and very friendly.  I also had to ask her for my bottle of water because when I placed my order, the girl didn't tell me whether I was supposed to get it myself or if she'd bring it to me.  Reguardless, I never got it so I had to ask for it.  I liked my salad.  It was pretty big and I ordered it as a combo with some flatbread, which was edible but nothing amazing.  Would i go back?  Sure, but I may order something different next time and hopefully that same girl that took our order is either trained more or kindly let go."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, with my date being my son - who is under a year old.  Both times, the staff have been very helpful in getting food, silverware, napkins, and to-go boxes for me.  The manager at this location is very helpful as well.    I love the little kid area as well and look forward to it when my son's a little older.  I also watched as a server made a milkshake for a little boy today.  They let the little guy watch and even let him pick out a straw!  The staff is truly kid friendly.  Their menu is expansive - appetizers, pizzas, soups, sandwiches, Italian dishes.... a little something for everyone.  My only issue is with the Pesto Harmony flatbread pizza.  The balsamic seems to be quite sweet for the rest of the pizza.  Other than that, though, I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"I used to love this place- seems like it went downhill!  I remember a pizza with toasted pine nuts, but they no longer offer it.  I was bummed but picked two others to take home. Neither pizza got finished in my household of 6.  I was disappointed and think it is over priced.  Maybe a will try again in another year or so.  For now, I had my fix.  nect time, I will stick with a salad or sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is A-OK. It's good, but there's nothing special about.   It was my first time here and I ordered off of their Tom-Tom Combo: Soup of the Day (Lobster Bisque) & Roast Beef Sandwich. The lobster bisque was reallyyyy good, but it also just taste like any other lobster bisque I've had. The Roast Beef is good, but it's hard to mess that up.   The one complaint I had was.. both my friend and I asked for no onions in our sandwich and both of our sandwiches had onions (surprise!).   Would I come here again? Probably. But not because it left such an impression on me, but because it's just like another Panera's Bread store... the food is good, the place is clean and nothing super terrible happened."}
{"text":"2.5 Typical salads, pizzas, wraps and sandwiches. They seem to go really heavy on the bread here. You order at the cash register, fill your drinks and they bring the food to you.   My salad was decent, everything was fresh. This place needs a good cleaning.  We were about the only folks in this place. If it was on my dime I would probably go somewhere else.    My folks like it and it is quick. They have things for kids like chicken fingers and smaller pizzas."}
{"text":"Tasty and big salads but kinda dismal feeling about the place. The staff was pleasant but not \"friendly\" as stated in their poster when you walk in. We went there on a Thursday which is family fun night with discounted kids meals which is nice because we have a kid. But they hire talent for these nights and the talent on our night was a creepy artist that drew a picture of us (not knowing) and then wanted us to pose with our picture so he could take a picture of his picture. Very uncomfortable situation didn't care for the drawing or sure if I should tip him for this unwanted picture, very awkward. Will probably go back but avoid the family \"awkward\" fun night."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time here and the food has been good and it's a good value! Note that this is a lunch spot with out wait service. The staff has always been nice. The restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Let's call the whole thing, on?  A large and delicious menu make this cafe a great place for a workday lunch break or catching up with some old friends.  The interior could, however, use some updating.  Not only do they serve genuine brewed SWEET tea, but they offer both Pepsi and Coke products! Whaaat?!?  Their salad dressings alone are worth the visit."}
{"text":"My parents brought me here when I was in visiting for a weekend and I was pleasantly surprised.  I had an Italian chicken sandwich that was very good.  The servers were a bit spacey but not terrible."}
{"text":"People's definitions of \"amazing food\" must vary quite dramatically. This place reminds me of what a poor man's Panera would be like, but with poor staff members that have to wear MC Hammer pants with red chili pepper print."}
{"text":"Stopped in the new Tomaydo Tomahhdo for lunch today. Located in the space that formerly housed Go Bistro, after walking in, at least visually, not much has changed. The booths are the same...the tables are the same...but now there's a modestly stocked beverage area, a children's play place, and some very red walls.   Like its predecessor, the Tomaydo Tomahhdo ordering methodology is fairly straightforward - you stand in a line, place your order, and then someone brings your food to your table and busses it when you're done. If you order a drink, there's a self service drink area located near the back of the restaurant.   I had a Tom-Tom combo, which is a half of something and a half of another something. I got the sonoma salad and the tomaydo mozzarella sandwich. Both were really good. The salad was much larger than what you'd expect for a half salad and the sandwich was pretty hefty, too. I have a pretty healthy appetite and I left feeling satisfied with my meal. I especially enjoyed the fresh, soft focaccia bread that was used for my sandwich. (but I'm a sucker for bread in general)   Service was fast. The restaurant was clean. And for under $10, I got a pretty delicious and hearty lunch. I'd definitely check it out if you're in the area...just note that the pizza oven isn't up and running just yet!"}
{"text":"The service here is very slow, waited about 20 minutes for our food and didn't get our smoothies until we were done eating. Really great food, but I would definitely order ahead next time."}
{"text":"The office ordered from here for the intern's going away lunch. The food was decent. I got a Left Coast Salad which was alright. I mean, it was a huge portion but it didn't taste amazing. Everyone seemed to be happy with what they got.  The delivery guy was a real sourpuss (I've never used that word in my life). He was complaining to the receptionist that I didn't leave my name when I ordered (the person who picked up the phone never asked). Then proceeds to tell me I need to leave my name next time (even though the receptionist knew to call me when the food arrived). Whoa there buddy, I don't need a lecture."}
{"text":"We decided to try this new restaurant. I had a very bad experience. As mentioned from Roxanne, you make menu selection on the menu board. It's hard to read the menu and too busy for the eye.  I ordered the \"House Homemade Tomato Soup\" and the meat lasagna. Both I didn't enjoy at all. The tomato soup is so salty. Looks like a canned tomato soup with some cream added to it and taste like someone spllled the salt shaker in it. The meat lasagna was not recognizable when it came in. It was served in a large indented bowl. Four pieces of garlic toast and a mass of melted cheese on top. Can't see the layer of lasagna. It looks like frozen lasagna sheets (the one with cheese already) layered with broken meatball. It was very salty and couldn't pin point the source. Again, it was from the tomato sauce. There's no tomato sauce in between the layers of lasagna, it on the side. I couldn't finish the dinner.   My wife ordered a Margarita Flatbread pizza. This sounds interesting. It was a nice presentation on flat board. The intepretation of the Margarita pizza is an insult. The flat bread was as thick as a regular pizzza, we were hoping to have a thinner crust. They layer tomato slices instead of fresh tomato sauce. Caramelized onions and the balsamic glaze drizzle on the pizza made it too sweet.   We had to find the server for drinking straws and silverwares. Perhaps they may have some good sandwiches as reviewed by Roxanne. If they cannot perfect their signature Tomato Soup which claims homemade, I am not sure what to believe.  I was going to walk next door to Five Guys Burger to wash out the bad experience.   I don't think I will go back again. It cost us $30 for dinner and went out unsatisfied. :("}
{"text":"Place was dirty and staff was very unorganized.  Food was okay but a bit overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"This place honestly is a joke and I miss the establishment that was in it's spot before. It is a panera style italian restaurant. Order at a register give your name or get a number and the food comes to you.  The food fits with its location. East of clevelanders are known for their bland taste buds and have been known to knock a restaurant because it actually has flavor. I wish I could write more about this place but honestly its just bland. Bland food, bland service and survives and showing itself as healthy and fancy. Not enough for this foodie."}
{"text":"A coworker strongly recommended that we go out to lunch today.  In addition, he strongly recommended that we go to Tomaydo Tomahhdo.  So off we went.  This was my first trip to this establishment and my culinary curiosity kicked in.  Upon arrival, we were surprised that the place wasn't crawling with people.  However, the counter was teeming with to-go orders.  Looks like most people call ahead.  We placed our orders and about 15 minutes later, our food arrived.  We were a little surprised by how long it took to make three sandwiches.  In reality, they probably made a LOT more than three sandwiches due to all the to-go orders.  So I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, but I had them convert it to a wrap.  I also ordered a side of the tasty-sounding cole slaw.  Coworker #1 ordered a turkey club with house-made potato chips and coworker #2 ordered the Blackened Chicken sandwich.  We were given a number and we took it and sat down in the back to await our grub.  As I was sitting there, a drop of water landed on my arm.  I looked around and didn't see anything.  Then another drop.  I looked up and I saw the ceiling was leaking water on the table, so we moved to a table closer to the windows, which also came with a better view of the women entering an exiting the establishment.  A lot of ladies frequent this place!  Finally, our food arrived.  My Buffalo Chicken wrap didn't have much Buffalo flavor at all.  My first bite had a strong taste of melted cheddar cheese.  It was warm and pleasing.  The wrap was made of spinach, which was a pleasant surprise.  I grabbed a bottle of Tobasco sauce and put some on my wrap to give it the kick I was hoping for and it did the trick.  The taste and quality of my wrap were very good, but not amazing.  Then I tasted my cole slaw.  It had peanuts in it, which was an interesting twist to an old classic.  The slaw was light and airy.  It was not weighed down with a heavy sauce.  It sort of lacked flavor.  The only thing I could taste was the peanut, wihch wasn't noteworthy.  I asked my coworkers how their sammiches tasted and they both said they were delicious.  Both of their sammiches were served on ciabatta bread, which I am generally not a fan of.  They offered me some of their home made potato chips, so I indulged.  They were quite tasty and didn't have a lot of grease on them. This place was turning out to be a half-way healthy lunch stop, minus the carbs.  But since coworker #1 was running 20 miles Sunday, he was trying to get a bunch of carbs into his system.  Overall, I'd say this place serves high quality food.  I'd really like to try their soups and pizzas in order to get a better idea of what they do.  The BBQ Chicken Pizza sounds awesome!"}
{"text":"I give this venue 4 stars because my meal was awesome but the lady who answered the phone when I called to place the order was not friendly. She was also the one who got my food for me when I got there and was not pleasant. I did however get the Sante fe salad and loved it. Definitely will be going back for the delicious food."}
