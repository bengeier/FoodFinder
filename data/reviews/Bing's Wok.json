{"text":"The restaurant itself could have used a MAJOR overhaul, but the food was excellent & really reasonably priced, & the staff were always friendly.  Unfortunately, it closed."}
{"text":"I like Bings. Try the curry chicken and the vegetable spring rolls. If you want to eat under 10 bucks and its local then you can't really go wrong with this typical Chinese place. The food is fine, go for it."}
{"text":"I was actually swayed by the review below to order from this restaurant.  I can't believe how far from the truth it turned out to be for me.  Ordered eggs rolls (cold and greasy), wonton soup (the wontons were ok, but no bits of pork in the soup and the soup, again, not even warm), chicken fried rice (greasy), chicken balls (overcooked, but the balls themselves had a good amount of chicken), hunan beef (nice taste, but the vegetables were way overcooked and slimy and overall greasy), Cantonese chow mein (greasy), sao mai and har gow from the dim sum menu (mediocre at best) and this is the kicker, we ordered the breaded shrimp and got the tiniest shrimp (the kind you get in a cheap shrimp ring), deep fried and oozing grease and they had the nerve to charge $9.99 for it.  In total we paid $61.10 including the 10% discount for pick up (we were earlier than the 30 minutes they told us and still lukewarm to cold food).  I love Chinese food and have been looking for a good place since Red Rose closed and this is awful.  I am SOOOOOOOOOOO disappointed.  Save yourself and go elsewhere. Your review helps others learn about great local businesses."}
{"text":"I was certain I'd reviewed this place in the past, but possibly on another website.  In any case, this is my personal all-time favourite stereotypical North American Style Chinese takeout place, for two reasons: 1) The food tastes noticeably better than anywhere else I've ever ordered Chinese food from, and 2) You can't beat the price.  Somebody in the back understands that quality ingredients produce a quality product, and I can taste the difference in every bite.  Bear in mind this isn't a fancy, 'authentic' eatery. If you were to look in the window, you might not be impressed. That's not what Bing's Wok is about, so don't worry about that.  If, however, you have a hankering for some typical Chinese takeout, you'll be hard-pressed to match the value and quality of this place.  Highly recommended."}
