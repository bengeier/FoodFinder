{"text":"Very very good! I got takeout Lamb Mughlai. Fresh and tender. I will stop in again! The location is fairly easy to get to and parking wasn't a problem."}
{"text":"I thought Taal Indian Cuisine located on Broadway Avenue in Beachview was the best Indian cooking I think I have ever had.  The chicken Tikka Masala was excellent.  The restaurant was very clean and neat.  The proprietor speaks English very well.  The wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.  I will definitely be trying more items on the menu"}
{"text":"After reading other Yelp reviews, I was excited to try Taal Indian Cuisine. I ordered take out, Butter Chicken with naan and rice. My meal was excellent. The inside of the restaurant looks beautiful. I plan on going back to eat-in soon."}
{"text":"Had the take out standard Indian - Butter Chicken and Tikka Masala last night. The owner seemed deeply interested in my opinion, and my opinion was that it was probably the best Ive ever had. Seriously. The restaurant is gorgeous inside and I genuinely hope they do well, because this is the kind of place and people that deserve it. Do yourself a favor and check this place out"}
{"text":"Great experience and food! The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, giving us some tasty meal recommendations and delicious drink pairings. When you go, you have to get a yogurt drink! We had a great time and will surely visit again."}
{"text":"Where do I begin.... My friend and I came for dinner excited to try a new Indian spot. That's where the excitement ends. The staff was sitting in the dining room staring at us the whole time which was really awkward. Particularly the creepy man that went outside and was standing right outside of the window looking in where we were seated. Weird. We ordered chicken tikka masala and aloo gobi to get a feel for the place, in my opinion both dishes are hard to mess up. Our tikka masala tasted like spaghettios and the aloo gobi was in a sweet yellow cream sauce which I have never had served like that before. The naan we got wasn't even naan it was legit the flat bread you get with a gyro. I felt really bad because the chef came out and asked what we thought and I didn't have the heart to say it was by far the worst Indian food I had ever had. We spent probably 15 minutes total there and left as soon as possible."}
{"text":"We had a Party of eight, and we all enjoyed our food and the service was excellent! We will go back again and try more dishes."}
{"text":"WORST Indian Food Ever! It's a bit harsh but there it is. I said it.  We (my sister and my better half) were craving Indian food and came here yesterday with high hopes after reading all the 5 star reviews and also since most of the Indian restaurants near by were closed on Mondays. The restaurant interior and furniture looks old and somewhat dirty and you can tell that the owner/management has done nothing to improve the look or feel of the restaurant.  When we got there, the restaurant was pretty much empty besides 1 table. We were asked to seat our self anywhere - so we chose the corner far end of the restaurant close to the kitchen door and next to the windows. The chef him self came to greet us and warned us that the AC until on that section wasn't working properly so if needed we can sit elsewhere which was nice. However, we chose to stay there since it didn't really bother us much.  Our server although friendly seemed new to this job. She seemed a bit nervous and was struggling trying to get us set up with plates, cups, water etc. She didn't seem to know much about the dishes which I can understand. We've all been there at some point.  We ordered masala tea, pakora and samosa (vegetable) for appetizers and butter chicken, chicken biryani and paneer tika masala for our main course. The main dish came with a choice of either rice or naan. So, we chose to go with one of each. Since she was struggling with the names as we placed the order - we made sure to repeat everything we ordered.  After few minutes, the chef came out to double check on our drink order. Apparently, the server wrote down Mango Lassi instead of Masala Tea but my guess is the chef had already heard that we had asked for Masala Tea. The Masala Tea couldn't be any tasteless topped with tea stains all over the cup as you can see from the picture. That's exactly how it was served with no attempt to wipe those stains. The Vegetable Pakora was partially uncooked - The outside was nice and crispy but the inside flour and spice mix wasn't fully cooked. As for the samosa, we got the meat samosa instead of the vegetable. I was okay to let go but wanted to check to see what kind of meat was in the filling since one of us did not eat beef. So, when asked she called the chef instead. We told the chef that we had ordered the vegetable samosa but that we were okay with the meat samosa as long as the filling wasn't beef (It was lamb). Turns out they didn't have Vegetable Samosa to begin with and that the chef had instructed the server to say so which she forgot to mention. However, we overheard the chef and the server get in to small discussion in the kitchen about the mixed order and the server saying that she had mentioned about not having vegetable samosas and that we were basically lying. Regardless, the meat samosa was pretty good.  At this point, we were very impatient and disappointed but still somewhat optimistic about our main dish. First came the Chicken Biryani - which looked and tasted nothing like a biryani. It's basically a low grade cooked rice mixed with some curry flavored spice and some chicken. The Paneer Tika Masala and the Butter Chicken look very much identical with the exception of one being chicken and the other a paneer. But then again, looks can be deceiving right? No! Not here. They tasted pretty much the same as they looked - like a can of microwaved heated tomato soup. The gravy was thin and runny with no spice or flavor to either of the dishes. The Naan that came with the meal was thin and small and tasted like one of those pre-cooked packaged naan. As you can see from the attached picture - we decided not to the eat much but instead pack it and perhaps re cook and flavor it at home and eat. So, when we asked for a box - the chef came and asked if we didn't liked the food. As much as my sister and fiancee wanted to complain about the food, service, the lying - I made a gesture to them to not say anything.  When the check came in - we were charged extra for the Naan (which was supposed to come with the meal). She quickly apologized and corrected the amount. And this is when it gets very weird. The server stood right next to us the entire time as I was signing the check and ready to leave a tip.   Needless to say, I would not recommend anyone to this place for Indian Food. If you have the slightest idea of what Indian Cuisine tastes like - you will be very much disappointed with Taal."}
{"text":"Great Indian food. The owner is super nice and the process are good. Check it out if you have a chance."}
{"text":"Super disappointed.  We ordered through GrubHub, and a few items were missing from our order. When we called to let them know, they told us they were out of what we ordered and called Uber and told them, and we had to work with Uber for a refund.  When we tried to explain we didn't use Uber, they didn't listen.  We called GrubHub, they told us the restaurant never notified them of an issue, and they would take care of it.  Then we decided to eat what food we did get. And I wish we hadn't.  The food was not good and didn't taste like anything was supposed to.  I get that the flavors can vary, but this wasn't even close.  I will never order from there again as there are some delicious Indian restaurants nearby that have never disappointed me like Taal did."}
{"text":"Ordered through Uber eats. The food was amazing. The chili chicken was so spicy and moist. Always a go to. We also got spinach with the Indian cheese and tofu. It's in the vegetarian section. Tasted really good. Overall we would order from them again and again."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here a few weeks ago. The food was excellent, The staff was attentive, the owner came over and talked to us he was honestly happy to have us. The food felt authentic, now I'm not an expert on Indian food so I can't say that it was but I could tell it was scratch made. The decor is old world Italian as it was formerly an Italian restaurant. I can't wait to see what they do with it. I've walked past the building several times before it opened and could see the potential. So I'd love to see it decorated to the culture."}
{"text":"Owner was so friendly!!!  Service was fantastic.  Owner made me a special side order  I recommend that if you like your Indian a bit spicier that you ask for a spice level one or two higher than usual.  We ordered a spice level 3 and it had zero spice. The mango lassi was thinner than I've had at other Indian restaurants. Those were the only things I could find wrong with Taal' s food.  This is a new restaurant off the main roads in the Beechview neighborhood.  It's a very small intimate restaurant too.  One bad thing about the building is that the restrooms are located down steep stairs.  That's just the way this building was built, nothing the owner can do about it. This was Davio's Italian restaurant for many years."}
{"text":"New restaurant in the location that was formerly Davio. First, the owner could not have been more engaging and even provided some samples of his offerings.  But to the food--based on my first experience I was very impressed. Indian food (like Chinese and Mexican) can be of varying quality, but Taal is clearly on the higher end. The masala and naan were excellent and just spicy enough without going crazy. The samosa was also excellent as were the accompanying dipping sauces. Prices were reasonable.  I look forward to eating here again and would recommend."}
{"text":"We were so exited to try a new Indian place with so many 5 star reviews.  Unfortunately, we went last week before the newer reviews were posted.  My sincere apologies to those who endured a meal there due to my delay in getting this review in.  There were several reviews saying this was the best Indian food they had ever eaten?  Really?  Have you ever had Indian food?  Based on early reviews we went in with high expectations.  They were so nice that we would really have liked them to succeed.  But that isn't going to happen.      On the plus side, the owner could not have been nicer.  He came out several times to see if we were happy.  We had a bottle of wine - no corkage charge.  The entrees here are about $3-4 less than other Indian restaurants so it was an inexpensive meal.   Also, since the food isn't very good, there is always plenty of seating.  We had the Chicken 65 as an appetizer.  It tasted like yesterday's tandoori chicken with some veggies and unremarkable sauce.  Also tired the Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala.  See the photos below.  Can you tell which is which?  The worst part is, it wasn't much easier to tell the difference when eating them.  Both where very heavy on the tomato sauce.  Perhaps this is an attempt to make Americanized Indian food devoid of spice?  If so, it doesn't work.  By far the worst was the Naan.  I know things change by region in India, but this Naan must have come from the region so far to the west that it was in the Arabian Peninsula.  It looked and tasted a lot more like pita than Naan.  See the photo.  If you are in the area and have a hankering for Indian food, just head to Mintt.  It's worth the extra couple of bucks."}
{"text":"This restaurant cannot cook Indian food- the Paneer tikka masala tastes like tomato bisque. Missing all of the spices to make this actually a desirable dish.  Also the naan that came with the order is Deep brand frozen naan.  This restaurant is to be avoided at all cost.  They also have horrible business ethics and practices.  I ordered from UberEats and they called me to tell me I had to pay more for my food because the prices on UberEATS were for, get this, DINE IN... the sheer idiocy of the owners, coupled with the bland and frozen food offerings, should discourage you from even considering this restaurant."}
