{"text":"Caesar salad was amazing. Gnocchi short rib was hardy but not heavy. And the creme de la creme was the pork chop. Best pork chop I've ever had. And then topped off with Best bread pudding ever had. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Awesome food, cool vibes and great drinks.  This is definitely our new 'go to' place!!!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous place!  Great food, fantastic service and a super atmosphere!  We had the chicken liver parfait, mussels, pork chop and gnocchi!  All delicious!  What perfect addition to Leslieville. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm really shocked that this restaurant was raved about in Toronto Life because the food is bland and disappointing. I went back in September of 2017, and I'm not sure if it was just an off night, but  our meals were not good. We tried about 4 dinner items on a very limited menu. I'm pretty sure I had a squash risotto and it tasted very strongly of vinegar - like something went rancid. 

The staff and host are amazing, friendly and informative and the decor is right up my alley. I'm a big fan of this little block of the city so I'm hoping to come back soon and have a fabulous experience because I'm seriously am wondering why so many people recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Bf and I tried this restaurant for brunch. I would say it's pretty ok but nothing to write home about. 

I had the brisket hash and he had the carbonara. The brisket hash seemed to imply that the potato would be shaved up (\"hash\") but it was just home fries. Brisket was good but the entire dish needed salt, which I was happy to add. The carbonara was quite nice too but heavy for brunch. 

My major issue with Bunny's was that it was supposed to feel like 38 degrees that day and the restaurant had no a/c. They left the door open but it was quite warm. A table of three men and a a table of two women had come and left by the time we were waiting for our food because they wanted to sit inside a comfortable space. Maybe it was just down for that day but I would call in advance to ask if the a/c was (a) working and (b) going to be turned on.

The orange juice is $4 and it's Tropicana- because we saw the tetra pack sitting on the counter. Don't get it lol it's a tiny glass. 

Service was good- but that's because there were 3 seated parties the entire time we were there and there was one server."}
{"text":"A great new addition to Leslieville! 
(Side note: And a fun, cool spot that immediately reminded me of Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist - the part about \"Where's Fluffy\"!!)

VERDICT: A really cool spot with a great vibe and fun decor (you gotta appreciate neon bunny's)! The service is good and the staff friendly. The food is yummy (see below for more details).

FOOD - THE GOOD: Their Eggs Florentine is great. Yummy. And not too heavy at all. Enjoying the saut√©ed spinach. The Squash Tartine (forgot the exact name) was also really good. A good recommendation from our waitress. Both dishes were really well seasoned - a great little explosion of flavours.

FOOD - THE BAD: The Brisket Hash. The potatoes were pretty undercooked. I could taste the toughness and grittiness in them. And there was barely any brisket in the hash... Super disappointing. I definitely won't be re-ordering this - and don't recommend it based on my experience. Another item that I've tried is their Breakfast Tacos. My friend ordered this item and I got to try it. It was ok. Nothing to write home about. But definitely not undercooked like the Brisket Hash.

Overall though it's a great place. It just has inconsistencies in terms of its food. But if you stick to the 'good' dishes it's an awesome place. Definitely happy it opened in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"We had a pretty good dinner here after a reservation mix up. The food was good and the service was great. The space is small, but very cute inside. Seems like a neighborhood spot--if I lived closer I'd go regularly."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the Queen East food scene. Fun quirky decor with framed images of  - you guessed it - bunnies, cozy atmosphere, attentive and engaging staff  and delicious food. The bucatini with meatballs is delicious and portion size is perfect. My partner enjoyed the Chicken Schnitzel (served topped with a fried egg). recommend. We will definitely be back for more. Soon!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and ordered the brisket and potatoes. It was all potatoes, 1 egg, and 3 bites of brisket. Most expensive plate of potatoes I've ever ordered. Waiter confirmed the brisket size was not a mistake. 

Our waiter was very friendly but forgot to put in our order and forgot what we ordered.

Overall terrible value. They're just banking on the overflow traffic from Lady Marmalade. Avoid."}
{"text":"The food here was super delicious. Shared the brisket hash and the eggs Hemingway, and was not disappointed. Good sized portions and every part of the meal tasted like magic. The coffee, which initially seemed expensive, upon tasting, was well worth it. Ask for some hot sauce on the side and you'll be rewarded with a very flavourful, albeit quite mild red pepper sauce."}
{"text":"Nearby and hungry and wanted to try something new, the bf and I popped into this cute restaurant that had art of bunnies all over.

I love risotto, so any time I see it as an option on the menu, it's a must have for me. It was the biggest plate of risotto ever served to me. The portion was enough to feed two people. It didn't taste bad, but wasn't the best I've ever had and it was a bit too runny. The runniness resembles a porridge like dish rather than a hearty risotto. Having absorbed most of the liquid, consuming the left over the next day tasted better than the original."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago a friend & I went to Bunny's since it is located close by. What a disappointment. I ordered eggs benedict which was just 2 poached eggs with hollandaise each on a three inch slice of toast with nothing else. For the $15 price tag I was expecting at least a side salad , some potatoes or some fruit. For 2 meagre brunch entrees, a shared French press of coffee with tax & tip it was $50.00. This is not what Leslieville needs."}
{"text":"Great spot to stop in for delicious food served by a very friendly staff!  We actually were visiting Toronto from Buffalo and had liked the previous restaurant at this location, \"Hey, Meatball\" by the same owners.   But Decor here is really beautiful. It's very comfortable upscale, moody in the best possible sense. 

We started off with the mozzarella tomato salad which was delicious, super fresh served on a beautiful traditional blue and white plate. My husband and daughter both had the steak which was melt in your mouth tender, nicely seasoned and served with bubbling Gorgonzola cheese.  I had the pasta with meatballs which were pleasantly snappy with Just the right hit of spice and a very fresh tasting sauce, topped with parm and fresh basil.  We were anxious to try the French onion soup but opted for the salad--next time we will try it for sure!"}
{"text":"Seems to be a common thread that people just find this place by sheer luck. And it's really good luck! We were just looking for some brunch, and this place is great. Non-descript exterior, but inside you'll find friendly staff and more importantly, fabulous food.
We had the smoked brisket hash and the breakfast tacos. The brisket is shredded and really good, the potatoes are properly cooked and seasoned, overall the dish is fabulous! The breakfast tacos were also great, but lacked some sort of salsa to finish the deal.
We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for a late brunch, and were promptly seated. The service was wonderful, and the food was absolutely delicious. The beef hash was incredible, as were the eggs Hemingway! The decor was adorable, and the staff were lovely. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Super cute place with excellent coffee! Went for brunch, and was sad the wafflemaker had broken, so I couldn't get those. I got pancakes, which were pretty good, but after seeing my partner's meal (burger with brisket on it), I kind of wish I had gotten something more lunch-like. The patrons around me had amazing-looking salads with eggs and other things. Maybe next time! Really liked the bunny-theme."}
{"text":"Nice renovation of the former Hey Meatball, while the menu is typical in size, 6-8 apps, 4 pasta dishes and another 6 or so entree's, the apps could use a little more focus on sharability.

The service was initially a little of the hurry-up style, but was it became apparent we were there for a while the pace became more reasonable.

Some interesting items on the menu when it comes to the entree's like the maple and miso cod, which was a very well prepared. The Flank steak was also better then typical, although the gorgonzola butter was very heavy on the gorgonzola, that's the risk with that particular cheese.

From a beverages perspective, the beer selection is very limited, but the wines are decently priced and cover a reasonable range, well suited to the menu overall.

Desert is the weakest point, although it may change frequently as the only source of information is the service staff."}
{"text":"New restaurant in Leslieville. Just happened to drop in looking for a meal with a friend. So cozy!  Food is amazing!  Service was fabulous. We loved the atmosphere and music. It's great when you find a restaurant by chance and end up enjoying it that much.  Will definitely come again"}
{"text":"One of the most disappointing experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. Service was very poor, food was disappointing, small portions, and overpriced. 

I had the brisket hash, which was basically just a small plate of potatoes for $15. It had one single tiny egg on top which was burnt on the bottom and undercooked on the top. Very small amount of brisket, which was cold. Overall very little seasoning and flavour. 

The two of us ordered coffee, which was served in a miniature French press that amounted to about 1.5 cups each. We had two of these, and were charged $16 for the equivalent of 3 cups of coffee!

I'm not fussy with restaurants whatsoever, I've never sent back a dish in my life and never bothered to write a review or complain to staff. This was just such a frustrating experience that I left feeling like I was completely scammed."}
{"text":"What an odd little delicious place. 

Let me start off by saying that if you have a fear of bunny decor... this place is NOT for you. What starts off as pictures of cute little bunnies, ends in a few terrifying photos of people running for their lives from the impending hopping death that comes their way. 

Located right on the busy stretch of Leslieville, this cute brunch spot offers more than meets the eye. Surprisingly spacious, surprisingly delicious and even more surprised that we managed to get a table immediately for brunch in Toronto! I'm sure it was a rarity as it was very busy throughout the time that we were there. 

Service was friendly, food flew out quick. 

I decided to go with the grilled cheese sandwich and added a pancake for fun. To my surprise, the pancake stole the show.. so definitely save it as more of a dessert piece for future noms. 

There also seems to be a mini bar and delicious beverages on tap, to my amazement the location is open pretty late considering I thunk it just did brunch. 

Bunny phobia aside, the place is real cute and deserves all the praise it can get. 

Like come on... when they put slices of lime in the water, it's not to cover up the taste of the tap... but it shows that they care right?"}
{"text":"Bunny's is a tiny little restaurant tucked in beside the Starbucks in Leslieville. I went there for weekend brunch.

I get that the theme of the restaurant is bunnies/rabbits, but I found the decor a bit strange. I can't say it's the most comfortable experience eating in a place with paintings of rabbits. I felt like I was in a house in a horror movie or something.

The food, however, is great. I got the Smoked Brisket Hash and it was delicious. The fried egg is a nice, simple touch and the meal overall felt very hearty. I would definitely recommend this dish if you're at Bunny's for brunch."}
{"text":"Dinner review: not good ya'll. 

Salads wayyyyy overdressed.
Mussels came out very smelly; not cleaned well. Some tasted questionable. 
Gnocchi was hard and chewy instead of light and fluffy.
Burger was VERY salty, almost inedible with side salad too overdressed to use to balance it out.

Such a shame for such a quirky place. Definitely a regrettable meal."}
{"text":"A solid and even reasonably healthy-ish brunch place. Friendly staff, tasty food. Coffee for two served in a French press. Even a decent price. The decor is a little underwhelming but the seats are comfy and the place isn't overly noisy. Overall, it's a solid choice."}
{"text":"If you like all things bunnies, then you've come to the right place. My friend and I checked this place out for brunch and the interior is cute. Although the decor almost gives off a gentleman's club ambient--not that I've ever been to one but based off of films, I'd imagine it would feel like this. 

Like, I would not be surprised if they had an underground strip club or something based on the interiors. Anyways, I'm sure you came here for a food review. Food's good, we enjoyed our dishes. However, for the price point, I would say it's a little more expensive than many brunch places in the area. It pales in comparison to Maha's and Lady Marmalade. 

I don't think I'd return again. But if you're into bunnies and down to try something new, by all means! The service was pretty good too."}
{"text":"The decor is splendid, dark and warm, but the acoustics and ceiling vents are not customer friendly. The round tables that run down the centre should not be there, as it's a small place and it brings the place down a notch.

It was two of us on a Tuesday morning around 11:15 a.m. There were two other tables seated when we walked in. We ordered coffee, juice and eggs Benny, all at the same time, but the eggs never arrived. 

We sipped coffee and juice for forty-five minutes slowly, meticulously saving some for our breakfast, sitting patiently, watching the restaurant fill to capacity. Eventually the server noticed our table needed some attention. He jauntily asks, \"where are your eggs?\" I thought he was joking at first, since we were wondering the same thing ourselves, for the last forty-five minutes, Toronto-style, politely assuming they'll be here any second now. 

He returns from the kitchen and casually asks, \"are you in a rush?\"It's a good thing he was looking at my guest's face instead of mine. With apologies, he explains that, although he took our order, 45 minutes ago, he was remiss in sending it in to the kitchen, [or even taking noticing for that matter.] 

The restaurant was now at capacity and our now lunch, would be lucky to arrive by mid afternoon. I had a birthday party planned for that evening with a list-full of errands to run, and guests to accommodate, so no, we were not going to be polite Toronto-style. He comped us the coffee and juice, and we promptly left. 

Good food and relaxing decor is paramount to operating a successful restaurant, but servers are the front line and the reason patrons either return to or retire from, a restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place to eat for brunch   I had the hash today and strongly encourage anyone to try it.  Great ingredients and good food.  Staff was excellent."}
{"text":"This is definitely a hidden gem in Lesliesville. We came across this place. Small & cute, and staff are friendly & helpful. We ordered Bunny burger is a must try. My friends ordered Tacos and it was delicious too. 
Small menu but looks like I will come back and try out the rest of their items here."}
{"text":"Omigosh this place is cute and gorgeous at the same time. They totally maximized their space to perfection. Although the table of 2s in the center of the space was tight, the round tables itself were sturdy and rustic. 

The food presented was nice (it could have been bulked up a bit more), but the taste was great. I ordered the Eggs Hemingway was delicious and the salad was great and not overly dressed. 

This is a fairly new brunch restaurant -opened only 2 months when we went. 

The service is great too. Everyone is nice, friendly and super helpful. 

I'd definitely come back (hopefully get a booth seat next time hehe)

Bunnies is the theme and I wouldn't change it!

Great job on the business guys! You made my weekend that much more fun this weekend!"}
{"text":"I was captivated to come inside given the neon flashing bunny sign. The place is quite small but cozy nonetheless. We ordered the eggs florentine (spinich eggs benny) and eggs hemingway (smoked salmon eggs benny) which came with salad on the side. The food did take quite a bit of time to come but our waiter was a pleasure. He was witty and made the dining experience enjoyable. The portion of the meal was decent with the poached eggs done nicely and the salad dressing was good."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious coffee!!! Yummy omelette of the day and bread pudding worth every calorie. An cool atmosphere and friendly service so I'll be back."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this gem while looking for a brunch spot in the neighbourhood and was absolutely pleasantly surprised at this hidden gem. 

Had the brisket hash for brunch which was a great value for price and was absolutely delicious. 

The staff were kind and welcoming and service was fast. I will absolutely be returning here very soon and would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Even though one of the paintings looks more like a were-rabbit than a bunny, the delightful decor here is engaging and conversation-provoking.

The dinner menu is short but thoughtful; the seven beers range from Sapporo to Blanche de Chambly to a local craft brew, and wines by the glass offer a similar degree of choice.

I had two specials, a richly creamy cod chowder that reminded me of long-ago trips to the Maritimes and a lamb main. The lamb was shoulder but carefully prepared and presented, seeming more like leg, and served over a stew of chickpeas, tomato and peppers. My partner had the chicken liver parfait brule and the burger, both from the regular menu. We both enjoyed our meals very much. I'm not usually keen on burgers, but a bite of my partner's has left me open to possibly ordering this another time. And the liver parfait came with a generous number of crostini, thus avoiding a mistake made by all too may restaurants.

Service was warm and welcoming. All together a lovely experience."}
{"text":"I told my server, I was going to sign up for Yelp and say how good their burger is.   Phenomenal. There's many wonderful looking things on the menu, but when the gentleman next to us received his burger, we immediately changed our orders.  Shout out to him!
Literally - the best I've had in TO, and I know that ye olde burger has become an 'it' food in 
 this foodie city.  

The patty itself is hand crafted, fresh and every bite was something to savour.  Cooked perfectly, right amount of pink.  It wasn't dry.  

At this point, it comes down to the bun - I've had many a good 'fancy overpriced toronto burger' ruined by an unflattering bun.  But this pretzel style bun was light, NOT dry and crumbly and the right balance of bread to support the incredible middle. 

Mixed greens with that dressing (I believe it was honey dijon) was the perfect side...I endulged but it wasn't heavy.   No need for fries.  And I love me some fresh cut fries...but this salad was redonk.

Lots of appealing looking stuff on the menu...this neighbourhood continues to change and Bunny's is definitely a new highlight.  Gotta check out brunch...but I may still put the 'unch' in brunch and order the burger.

Note - it's quaint.  Best suited for date nights/groups of 4 and under.  No stroller parking."}
{"text":"I went here tonight for a special occasion with a friend. We both live in the area and there was a bit of hype around this place upon it's opening. We were intrigued, as we couldn't find a menu online and compared to most places, the reviews/foodie pics/etc. were lacking. A bit of mystery! We entered with an open mind...

While the service was great and the ambience was dark, very unique and extremely intimate (overall lovely!) - the food was unfortunately beyond subpar. We ordered the risotto and gnocchi dishes. Both had to be heavily salted by yours truly - which is an insult to any chef, but it was so incredibly bland that I had to do it. It was also oddly room temperature - not cold enough to complain, but definitely didn't taste pleasantly warm, or fresh. Which was odd...because we were literally the only table in the restaurant! For a good hour, no one else walked in. Overall, despite the large, very generous portions - we felt that for $20+ a plate, we were being a bit ripped off when it came to the actual quality of the meal. 

One bonus is that we got a nice-ish bottle of wine to split for a reasonable $36 (though it was a white) and again, the service was really great and the spot itself was quite visually appealing.

Overall, I wouldn't go back. The bill came up to $110 and even though I had a nice time and I wouldn't call it a bad experience, it definitely didn't feel worth the price or deserving of the hype."}
{"text":"The breakfast taco's portion was quite generous, and the pickled red cabbage has nice kick of heat. My husband wasn't a fan of the hidden citrus flavor, otherwise it's not bad. 

The bunny pancake with blueberry sauce, maple syrup and whipped cream. Again, the portion size is quite generous with 3 huge pancakes. It's nice and fluffy, aside from it being a bit burnt. I would ask to have the maple syrup on the side next time so it's not dredged in syrup. 

The side of peameal bacon was fine for $4. Thinly cut and not too salty. 

We would come back to try other brunch items. :)"}
{"text":"Was going to visit Lady Marmalade down the street, but the lineup there was crazy. Stopped by Bunny's instead since there was barely a wait, my friend and I got seated within minutes. I ordered the smoked brisket hash, which was soooo delicious, the brisket was perfectly smoked and seasoned, the entire dish was extraordinary. My friend ordered the classic egg Benedict, and as we expected it was perfect, eggs were perfectly poached. We both had dessert, (the guy served us did a really good job at selling us, which I'm not complaining) I ordered the bread pudding and my friend had the Eaton mess. Both were awesome and in big portion. I would say I werent supposed to order so much, but I don't regret it. Great service + great food, what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"What a nice and unexpected surprise. First of all,  no line up for brunch in a sea of line ups up and down the street. I dread the day when this gem of a restaurant is discovered by others! Secondly, service is superb. Friendly and prompt. Thirdly, coffee!! What can I say, it's simply delicious. Comes in different size French press made for sharing or 2 nice since cups for the single serve. Lastly, what a great variety of food. And delicious to boot. We shared avocado toast and the flavours were wonderful. Lime creme fraise complimented it beautifully. Pancakes so light they are almost crepe like. Pasta carbonara with rich  creamy flavor and the smoked corn beef hash will be a repeat order for me! Perfect smokiness with lovely soft sweet and regular potatoes and nicely sunny side up egg on top. Decor is fun with bunny pictures and bunny books at some of the booths. Completely lovely brunch. Rodney Bowers has done a terrific job. I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I had a really good time here for brunch one weekend... and that's coming from someone who doesn't really \"do brunch\" often. 

Firstly, I love LOVE rabbits so obviously the decor was A+ to me! It was about half full when we came in and got to choose the table with a copy of The Velveteen Rabbit at the table. (It's one of my favourite stories!) 

The brunch menu was diverse enough that each of us chose something different and 3 out of 4 dishes were really good and tasty (breakfast tacos, brisket, and eggs benny). The other wasn't bad, just not as great (cubana). 

I'm also not a huge fan of booze in the morning  so I had a pretty decent coffee but my friends enjoyed their caesars and mimosas. The mimosa looked really refreshing though. Maybe next time!"}
