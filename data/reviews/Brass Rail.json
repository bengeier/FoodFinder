{"text":"The four stars is strictly for the night life. I never ate here before or had dinner. It's always a place to go at night for some fun, laughter and drinks!   As you first walk in you immediately think no one is here and the bar is not so hopping and bopping with people. It's a very relaxed environment up front. So if you are looking for a bar that's not too busy and relaxing just stay up in the front.   BUT..if you walk towards the back you then see the real party is in the back with a few bars in the back and a dance floor to get your groove on. The party is back there, people are dancing, drinking and having a good time.   You get the best of both worlds! Also as a coconut rum drinker try the new Electric Lemonade! It is truly electrifying! The other summer drinks are just as tasty.   The drinks a reasonably priced and the staff is very friendly. The location is probably the only negative because it's off of Lebanon Church Road past west mifflin so once you are there that's all that is around you."}
{"text":"Typical bar with typical bar food.  I'm not a huge fan and really couldn't find much I wanted to eat, but it was fine for what it was.  Drink specials were pretty good and the service was friendly.  Just not my kind of place."}
