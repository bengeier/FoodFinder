{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! She hung up on me when i called back to tell them we got the wrong pizza. Instead of trying to figure out what went wrong or to make the customer happy she hung up on me yet again. Good luck if u order here!"}
{"text":"I think they're food is pretty good. I love the ham hoagie. The pizza is very good too. Best of all are the prices. They are by far the lowest in town."}
{"text":"I never even got the order from this place because the number listed is apparently some old ladies number who is very rude and how this information wasn't updated I don't know nor do I find it very responsible of the pizza shop"}
