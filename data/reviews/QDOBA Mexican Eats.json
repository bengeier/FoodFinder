{"text":"Last review said Qdoba served frozen guac??? This couldn't be further from the truth!!!! Qdoba ALWAYS makes fresh guac from a case or sometime two avocados, EveryDay!!!! Ask to watch them make it!!! Totally FRESH everyday!!! I believe Chipotle is the one w frozen guac and a Chipotle worker made this review"}
{"text":"My favorite place for fast Mexican food in Oakland. Love that they are actually open past 10 unlike most places on Forbes. Staff is always friendly and the student discounts also make it great!"}
{"text":"It amazes me how crowded most Chipotle locations are while this place never seems to be busy. People have no clue what they are missing out on. Qdoba is slightly more expensive than Chipotle, but the quality of their chicken and steak is much better than Chipotle and they give you more of it in their burritos. Plus, Qdoba does not charge extra for guacamole like Chipotle does, and Qdoba offers several different types of queso for your burrito, which is so delicious. I love this place and I hope it sticks around, because as long as it is here I am never going back to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Needed taco fixin's for a last minute office lunch party.  Not being a party planner, I was advised to use QDoba's.  Called and spoke with Rebecca, who could not have been nicer or more accommodating. She helped me figure out what I needed...and got it to us at the agreed upon time.  The ingredients were fresh and well prepared.  I would highly recommend, and will most likely use again, although we don't have many office parties.  Thank you Rebecca!"}
{"text":"Great flavors! I love the flavor of their shredded beef. The queso and guac are fresh. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Food was okay but staff was unfriendly. Order a kids meal and was charged for a regular meal. When I mentioned that I order a kids meal the cashier looked at me and asked \"Are you sure?\" Horrible experience."}
{"text":"This place used to be good.  I hadn't been there since earlier this year.  Their lime rice used to be delicious and they even had grilled veggies which I would get on my naked burrito.  Yesterday, when my husband went to get the order which consisted of a veggie and a chicken naked burrito, he said that there was nothing in the pans and that in his words, \"They were scraping the bottom of the pans\" putting the food in our order.   He ordered the chicken and got almost no chicken in there.  They looked at my husband like he was crazy when he asked for the grilled veggies for my order.  When he brought the food home, I noticed immediately, the rice didn't taste the same and there were no grilled veggies.  They had filled it up with a lot of lettuce and very little of anything else, which was like a big salad.  What a waste of money!  The quality and taste has definitely changed, and we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Not a huge Qdoba fan. They don't have many or any at all where I used to live, but I thought I'd try it a few times instead of getting Chipotle.

This Qdoba is located near the campus of Case Western Reserve University. My experiences here weren't the best. First of all, they were all out of meat, so I had to wait for them to cook up a new batch. The guy who   steamed the tortilla for the burrito did a horrible job, and ended up over-pressing it, which stretched the tortilla. When the lady at the end of the line went to roll the burrito up, she ended up tearing it. Now, I've been to this Qdoba twice, and this was the second time that she tore it. Like giving birth to a baby...

\"Crap. Would you like it double wrapped?\" She asks. No, I don't want it double wrapped! I want to actually taste the ingredients inside, not just tortilla on top of tortilla. 

It's not that hard to run a Qdoba, and the food was good, I admit, but this one needs to hire better workers who actually know how to maintain their work station! Messy!"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of beans, so I enjoy the Fajita Ranchero Burrito which is just rice, chicken or steak, peppers and onions, your choice of salsa, and cheese.  Tonight's version was tasty for $7.  

The restaurant was a little chilly and nothing special about the service.  

Overall, it always seems worth the extra $2 to spend vs. Taco Bell crap for a decent burrito but it's not the best one in town."}
{"text":"This place is often busy, but if you are willing to wait then the food is pretty good.

This is one of the best qdoba restaurants in the area, and you get a lot of food for not too much money."}
{"text":"Another good burrito.  Serving size is huge always have trouble finishing it.  Quick service and clean place to eat."}
{"text":"I generally like Qdoba but this one in Birkdale has the worst custome service I have ever experienced. My family and I have been in there 4 times since moving to the area and each time we've had some sort of instance wherre the staff have acted or reacted to customers in a completely rude manner. We will not be returning to give thm another opportunity."}
{"text":"There are a few Qdoba's in the area, but this is the one I frequent most. It is clean and modern inside. I usually get steak burritos and I have always had a great experience with the staff and the food in general. Everyone is friendly, and I absolutely love that they don't nickel and dime you for toppings. I love this place and it is one of my favorites when we are looking for somewhere fast-casual."}
{"text":"I have been working a contract in center Charlotte for a couple months now and don't often pack a lunch. There are a lot of options in center city, however about one to three times a week I eat here.

Not only are they the tastiest of all of the burrito assembly line joints. They are consistently clean, which matters a lot to me. I have yet to see random meat chunks fallen into beans or cheese all up in the quac.

Also, the habanero salsa is awesome."}
{"text":"I have been here twice this month and the food and the service have been consistently great! Defiantly my new go-to place."}
{"text":"The Chicken burrito was Amazing!!! I love the chips and Queso sauce.
I can't wait to go back until I have tried everything on the menu lol
LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"I love Qdoba. Whenever I eat at another place like Moe's or Salsarita's I find myself comparing it to Qdoba and appreciating the variety but thinking it's just not Qdoba. Their burritos are about the same price as elsewhere but bigger. They have also have a great selection of other foods. My go to dish used to be their burritos but now it's the Mexican Gumbo. So good.

The location of this Qdoba is great. It gets really busy like all other eateries around Myers Park at lunch but it's worth the wait. The manager, Mike, is really nice and recognizes the regulars and calls them by name.

Don't forget to sign up for your Qdoba card so you can get free entrees!

There is also $1 beer on Fridays with the purchase of an entree... a nice warm evening, you've finished your work week. You meet some friends for delicious Mexican food and eat it outside while enjoying a $1 beer. It's a great start to a weekend.

Overall Qdoba is a great place if you want some quick Mexican."}
{"text":"This my second visit to this location.  My first since my last visit to Las Vegas five years ago.  We stay in the Tahiti Resort on Tropicana and this restaurant is just around the corner.  Although I did not ask for it they also give a discount to Tahiti guests.

We took out two steak burrito bowls with all the trimmings.  Very very good.  The portions were full sized, the meat and vegetables fresh and the wait staff was very attentive.  My only complaint was that there we temporarily out of white rice.  This should not happen as they were not that busy.  Give them a try, I think you will like what you find."}
{"text":"Not super awesome. My wife's sour cream tasted like old cheese and her quesadilla had some sort of protoplasm in it.  Super not cool"}
{"text":"Thought I would try Qdoba as the interior of the restaurant looked like Chipotle. I brought the 3 tacos home only to find subpar chicken and old rice. The corn salsa had a good taste and kick, but hardly medium spice I was hoping for. 

Staff seemed okay."}
{"text":"Excellent  customer service, Affordable  price. The staff created a plate of all 3 of the most popular  tacos. The cheese dip is amazing. They were very pleasant  and afterwards came to the table to clear our plates and ask if we enjoyed the food. Extremely  impressed with the customer  service for a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"3 of my family members got sick after eating their guacamole.  

1 extra star because it at least tasted good while eating it.  Even if it did make us sick for the next day or 2."}
{"text":"Great food! Always get the chicken nachos and chicken soft tacos when I come here. Prices are good and service is pretty good I just wish they would have more locations. This place is literally across town from me and is always busy. Would be nice!"}
{"text":"I went to this Qdoba a few times. No matter what I ordered, it was always bland. No amount of almost empty bottles of Cholula hot sauce could make up for it. They also have no idea of portion control when it comes to guac. Which means if you're getting some, prepare for two small avocado's worth.

Although this place seems to have a reputation for bad customer service, my service has been pretty okay overall. Their pricing can be a bit weird at times though. They are not very consistent with what they do and don't change more for."}
{"text":"I don't go to a lot of fast food places, but this is one I have been to way too many times :)

I really like the food here. I almost always go with the \"Naked Burrito\", or a bowl that you can pick and choose what to add to. It comes with white or brown rice. Black or pinto beans. A selection of types of meat (chicken, beef, pork (or veggie)), and a choice of salsas, sour cream and lettuce. You can also add quesa (cheese) sauce. It's good, but not very healthy, I believe :) You can also add grilled peppers and red onion. To be honest I think all of it is good! After having tried all the meats I would definitely pick the chicken, but that could just be me loving chicken a bit too much.

They do of course have a lot of other things to chose from, but the bowl is the best option!"}
{"text":"I really love Mexican food. A lot. And I cannot stand to eat at this restaurant. I've had a few different things on the menu, but I am just never satisfied with the quality of their meat. Every time I've had anything with chicken on it I've been greatly disappointed. Qdoba is basically the only restaurant I will not eat at. And I will eat almost anything."}
{"text":"First a preliminary rant, yay. The typical compliant against Qdoba is that \"it's not authentic Mexican.\"  I say, \"Who cares?\"  I don't see why food has to confer to what people think it should be if its successful on its own merits.  The valid comparison in my mind is not whether the food adheres to what you expect it should be, but practically how it compares to other restaurants of similar class.

So the Dobe offers stuffed burritos that while pricey, around 6-8 dollars, for grab-n-go are a good chunk of food.  I recommend going when you're absolutely starved.  Like Subway, the Dobe offers you nearly all the extra ingredient fixings you want, a nice selection of hot sauces, and vegetarian options.  I prefer their shredded cheese more than many burrito places method of one or two slabs of cheese because it's more noticeable here.  Their more inventive options I've had less success with including their BBQ Mole Sauce which was blah, stick with what you know you like.  Their menu irritatingly describes the options so similarly its very hard to distinguish much between items.  Largely, you're burrito is defined by what you specifically ask them to put in it rather than any menu selection.  

Essentially, for those who like more in the burritos, copious amounts more, Qboda will shine since you can insist I them putting in everything.  If you prefer a simpler burrito, or aren't all that hungry it's really not worth it.  This customization is the only real rationalization of the expensive prices.  My familiarity with the non-burrito options has been limited but every time I'm in there what I see of them dissuades me.  

The chain could also use a bit more of a theme since its pretty bare inside.  Obviously, no one goes to a fast grab-n-go place for the environment and dcor but a little something is still nice.  It's more the lack of anything that really makes it an issue.  Their dull design is straightforward, clean, black tables and high stools.  Which to be honest, every time I'm in a Qdoba I found it awkward, alienating, and uncomfortable and prefer to eat elsewhere.

Overall, it's a worthy chain for an occasional splurge, however it's disconnected interior and expensive options prevent it from becoming what a chain strives to be, a comfortable and welcoming sight."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I eat here about every two weeks. We always get takeout, and are in and out the door in less than five minutes, even if there is a line. The staff are comical and animated. They make good food even better by joking with the customers and interacting with them. It goes very quickly, but in that time span multiple people on the line converse with you. They also never short staff the line. There are at least four people on it, and one clerk on the register at all times, making for an efficient and pleasant dining experience. I highly recommend this establishment. We've wanted one for a year, and it was worth the wait. Moe's pales in comparison."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, was on my way to subway and came across this place. I was surprisingly happy and I would have to say I enjoyed it a little more then chipotle.

The employees were super friendly and the place was very clean. Will most likely be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for a quick and nice lunch! Just go there and the people are soooo nice!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just got a monster burrito from here!!! very good salsa;s are awesome!If  your in the mood for burrito's I recommend"}
{"text":"Pretty good for quick Mexican food. The chicken quesadilla is pretty good too. Normally this place is fine, but there's one female employee who always has an attitude. I say \"thank you\" and she scowls. She also jips you on chicken. She doesn't even give half a scoop of it for each taco, whereas all the other employees give at least a scoop. She clearly needs Midol. Other than that occasional issue, it's a good stop for a quick Mexican food craving."}
{"text":"Love this place! Clean,delicious food,authentic Mexican food,real food & polite professional employees I go here at least 3 times a month"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of Qdoba and I love that they offer guac and queso for no additional charge!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the Mexican Salad, Wrapped Burritos, and a variety of Tacos. The Pork used in the Mexican Salad was superb! Each of the items ordered were prepared exactly as requested.
Our family having owned various themed restaurants around the United States perhaps gives us better insight into what is quality in ingredients, preparation, and service compared to Las Vegas customers. It  is interesting that in the Las Vegas Valley, the number of restaurants that serve 'Entrees' with quality ingredients,properly prepared to order AT ATTRACTIVE PRICES are few and far between. As to  Mexican, and other themed, Cafes/ Restaurants in the Las Vegas Valley, other than Qdoba, one might say: \"Lo Siento Mucho\".
Maintained quality of food and service will bring repeat customers."}
{"text":"Yuck!!!!!! I know not to expect anything great at a fast food place but my money would have been better spent  at Taco Bell. The chicken was fatty with a nasty seasoning. For what we paid we could have had a great meal at Azteca."}
{"text":"I was shopping nearby and spotted this Qdoba. I had never been to one before so I decided to give it a try.

To sum up the look, feel, and menu of the restaurant, all I need to say is think Chipotle. If you've ever been to a Chipotle then you've been here. 

The menu is also 90% identical to Chipotle, just named a little different.

Since I love the steak fajita burrito at Chipotle, I decided to get the same thing here. It wasn't hard- you order exactly the same way and direct the worker to add what you want (exactly the same ingredients available too).

So I got my carbon copy burrito and unfortunately the taste was the only thing different. The steak in the Qdoba was not seasoned- it was just steak. I'll admit it was good steak, but in a burrito, I want seasoned meat. The burrito was a bit bland IMO.

So to sum up, I found Qdoba to be a near perfect copy of Chipotle- except for the lack of flavor.

Only 2 stars for being copy-cats."}
{"text":"Held off on my review to make sure my experience was consistent.  And it sure has been. Delicious food and the best is seeing the friendly staff who go out of the way to please. I come weekly for my dose of qdoba. I highly recommend you come give it a try. My favorite is the tacos.. just can't crave my qdoba taco addiction."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of 'fast food' Mexican food, but this place is different. From the moment you walk in the door you are greeted with a very hearty hello and welcome. There hasn't been a time that I have been in here that they haven't offered to let me try something before I decide.  All their items are fresh and made in the local stores. (other than the tortillas) and it tastes like it.  

The cheese sauce is the bomb and the grilled chicken will make you question trying any other of the meat choices. So far I has have the soft tacos, the nachos, the naked burro (in a bowl no tortilla) and each one is as good as the last.  My best fried goes for the burrito and even as a big eater this kicks his rear.  

Great food, good value, a really nice place to kick back, eat and relax."}
{"text":"To bad I walked away with lunch for the girls and the orders were wrong.  But the worst was the customer service. We are always looking for dinner 7 night's a week. Fortunately we won't be back, Unfortunately for Qdoba looses 14 women's dinners any other times we order for the office.  Won't be back ! Time to value your customer's and appreciate the business of anyone entering your establishment. Word of mouth does go along way. Thanks for YELP"}
{"text":"I ate here a while back and forgot to post my review because usually im too busy drinking...but this food is great.fast service,the meat is cooked just right.I ordered the big ass steak burrito loaded with everything but the kitchen sink and it rocked.They really do know how to make great mexican food.I'm actually contemplating now if I should go grab a burrito quick since I live like a minute away ...:)"}
{"text":"Thanks Lucky Karmz for introducing me to Qdoba.  I'm not one TexMex or Mexican food or chains but we were in a hurry and Qdoba was right there.  The guacamole is so good.  I had the chicken quesadilla which was alright but it was that much better with the guac smeared all over it.  I can't say that I'll go out of my way to find one of these but it's good to know that there's something I like here."}
{"text":"I started eating here just recently, and so far the food and service at this location has been exceptional. The great selection of fresh and flavorful ingredients keeps me coming back. Taco Tuesday is where it's at! Can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've had Qdoba food and I was glad I took the time to stop.  Ate w a y  too much as usual but I don't feel guilty because I rarely get a chance to eat there since they closed their store on Craig & Jones.  I really miss this place.  Hope to see them open another location North or North West in the valley."}
{"text":"Just a standard qdoba but would never go again. The whole place smells like stale cigarette smoke and made me sick."}
{"text":"The biggest rival in the fast food industry for the best Mexican food is between Chipotle and Qdoba. Most people have a personal favorite or opinion on why one is better than the other. I personally enjoy them both but I believe that Qdoba wins over my favor. Qdoba has more to offer than Chipotle. For example, Qdoba offers fresh homemade queso that Chipotle does not. Being in college and on a tight budget, Qdoba also offers free student drinks for all high school and college students. The quality of the meat, tortillas, and ingredients at Qdoba is much more fresh than that of Chipotle. I would recommend Qdoba over Chipotle any day."}
{"text":"I love their veggie tacos!!! And that's about all I normally get there. But I only get one thing when I go to Chipotle, too- a barbacoa burrito. For veggie [non-vegan] dishes, I prefer Qdoba."}
{"text":"I eat there fairly regularly. It's quick. You get a fair amount of food for the money. It's tastes pretty good. I'll keep returning."}
{"text":"Here's my advice: go to qdoba and get a cup of queso. Then go to chipotle and ask them to put it on. You should not go here. The rewards program is also absurd. Just gimme a punchcard; it would be so much easier."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from eating here. Ended up puking in another restaurant because of them."}
{"text":"Good food. Had vegetarian options on the menu which was great. I had the vegetable burrito and it was huge. I was very full after my meal. Friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Not veggie friendly.. so I've always liked Qdoba better than Chipotle, which happens to be right next door to them, but I'll definitely go to Chipotle from now on! Normally I grab food on my way to work in the evening,  but today I stopped in around 3pm..what a difference. I ordered a vegetarian burrito and get this they charge for an extra scoop of lettuce! This extra charge is not listed on the menu and it's a vegetarian burrito, what else would you put in it? Chipotle has tofu, Qdoba does not. I did not get the grilled veggies on it because they are always salty and normally I just get a lot of lettuce on it beside the rice and beans. Now it is not like I wanted a bowl of lettuce just 1 extra scoop and yes there is a charge for that. I have never been  charged extra at any other Qdoba nor at this store in the evening for lettuce. What made it even more surprising is this extra charge is not listed on the menu.  So when asked for a customer service number to file a complaint she kept insisting I call the survey number on my receipt to speak to a live person....total lie no live person just a recording so I ask her for a store manager or a districts manager 's name and she claims there isn't one that they are between district managers..Finally I gave up and searched online,  found a customer service number where an actual personal answered, got a store and a district manager's name and a promise of a return call. Being charged extra for something  like lettuce bothers me, but being lied to is unacceptable.  I could've dealt with just filing a complaint about the lettuce charge and went on with my day, but being lied to is terrible customer service. Next time I will just go to Chipotle where they don't charge for lettuce and the employees are nicer."}
{"text":"For the money not worth it, for two burritos two chips and queso and two drinks was 26$. Could of went to chilies right next door for the same amount and had a sit down meal. Chips were also stale. Queso is good and the burrito was good just $$$$$$"}
{"text":"Watch out for the short fat white girl she makes burritos with hatred and will put holes in it, call that shit and tell her to remake it"}
{"text":"So last week I was on the other side of town, so I stopped at a ChipolTe. Food was cold, no flavor or spice to the food. Qdoba blows it out of the water!! Plus their queso sauces ate delicious. Great service, and will let you sample to taste new things!"}
{"text":"Maybe just having a bad day? I was there around 2, and the garbage was full (borderline overflowing). The soda machine was out of Barqs. The queso didn't taste quite right. The wifi was not working.

On the plus side, burrito was still very good and service was friendly."}
{"text":"Best mexican fast food! Very yum Mexican Gumbo (vegetarian)."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for a quick take home dinner on a week night.  The food is good and consistent. I usually get the grilled chicken burrito or naked burrito or naked burrito ad my husband tends to mix it up.  We have even had them cater an event with crowd pleasing results."}
{"text":"It's mid-priced Mexican cuisine on the fast.  Think of it as the next step up from Taco Bell, but a step down from Pedro's or Chi-Chi's.  

Not everything on the menu is a winner, but the pulled pork quesadillas are outstanding and the Mexican gumbo is pretty solid, especially on a really cold day.  

I rarely understand the people behind the counter on the first try.  Usually, they have to ask their question two or three times.  I love our Mexican brethren, but they're not too fluent on zee Engrish...

Don't think this place is the be-all, end-all, but it's okay."}
{"text":"Terrible experience and terrible customer service. They dropped my bowl on the table and nearly half of the stuff inside were coming out. They just put a little more back and pretend nothing happened. Never go there again. Really bad."}
{"text":"WOW!!! This is the place you want to go for fresh and tasty food. Great service and friendly staff.Everything at one price and no up charge for guac.
Love it and will return."}
{"text":"Chipotle line was out the door, so I figured let's see how Qdoba is still in business. Upon walking in, the tables were mostly all dirty. I go to order, and see the kitchen is disgusting. Rags and trash scattered throughout the kitchen floor, and there was raw chicken next to cooked chicken just a few feet away from a big bowl of guacamole that seemed to be sitting out too long. I then go to order, and get to give my order to someone who'd rather be watching grass grow than work there. The other employees have their pants halfway to their knees... (How appetizing). The food itself? Chicken tastes like it was manufactured then injected with silicone. Corn seemed like it was fresh... Out of a can a week ago. Rice was exact same as chipotle with cilantro, yet was much more gross and mushy.

Oh, and to top it all off... It's more expensive than chipotle!! Isn't that great. Disgusting kitchen, inappropriate employees, manufactured food, and all for a higher cost. Fantastic."}
{"text":"Wow! Just discovered this place. SUCH great fresh food. Really loved the guacamole and the fresh vegetables, which were \"just right.\" Manager also was super friendly and doing a great job. Insisted in giving me a free drink after some confusion with my card. My new favorite. And I like it way better than Chipotle. Food is just BETTER, somehow."}
{"text":"They have good food. I like the Coke Freestyle machine. The food is delicious, and they are an underrated establishment!"}
{"text":"how disappointing!  the Qdobas in NYC are pretty good - they have to compete with Chipotle after all, who i think puts crack in their food because it's so addictive.  here though, after multiple tries, i just got mediocre bland food in many forms.  too bad because i know it can be good."}
{"text":"Delicious !
The Quesadilla, 3- knock out tacos we had were very good. Food is not greasy and full of flavor. We also tried chips with Queso Diablo yum! It was a bit spicy as it has chunks of jalapeño.
If u are around try it.
Next to the Henderson DMV after being there for 2 hours this meal was worth it ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant! 5 Star! Im always greeted with a smile! Super nice manager and staff! Thank you very much!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in this location yesterday just as they were opening. The workers barely acknowledged us and did not appear to be ready for service. We studied the menu and finally ordered the lime chicken tacos and a quesadilla. It took over 15 minutes to order and get our food. No urgency and kept going in the back to get things. I went to get our drinks to find the machine spewed out and got me wet. All of the diet drinks were out, so we settled for tea. By this time, the line behind us is 10 deep and no one can get drinks. The workers kept coming over to open the machine and push some buttons, but no drinks. There was a huge sticky mess in front of the machine, so the worker moved the rug over it. After watching all the obvious inept behavior and lack of attention to anything, we threw away our food and left. They need a complete overhaul of employees."}
{"text":"Usually this place is good. I like it better than Chipotle but tonight was honestly just terrible. I ordered a burrito online and everything was correct, picked it up 15 minutes later. When I got home all it had on it was shredded beef, guacamole, beans and rice! I ordered a burrito with roasted corn salsa, cheese, guacamole, beans and rice, ancho chile sauce. The rice was extremely hard and the avocado tasted terrible. I just can't believe that I was charge $7+ dollars for a burrito that didn't even have half the things I ordered! I won't be going here anytime soon. If you can't get a burrito correct than why are you working there?!"}
{"text":"best queso ive ever had man!! i put it on my tacos and man is that stuff goooooood!!! better than moes southwest girll, i tell you what!"}
{"text":"The food at this location is poorly prepared and totally lacking in anything I would call good flavor. The staff is not particularly friendly, especially management. I don't know about the average customer, but I know that I do NOT like being treated like dirt and get terrible food as a reward for putting up with it. Avoid this location."}
{"text":"First time ever coming here, in fact I never even knew this place existed, but when looking at the prices I was taken aback... $6 for a burrito, I say to myself. But nit eating all day I decide to \"take the hit\". Then I see why, the burrito was massive and almost forced me to use knife and fork. I got chicken with Brown rice. Though everything is in warming trays, the rice was fine, not dry at all, and the chicken was of good portion. It was a good choice. One I'll make again."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican fast food places I've been to. Definitely better than all the other quick Mexican food locations that I've visited. Their habanero salsa is so delish."}
{"text":"If you want a stomach ache, terribly wrapped burrito, & over pay -eat here. Students don't know how to make a simple burrito and it sits in your stomach like a rock for hours"}
{"text":"Literally the worst Qdoba in Charlotte. They're always running low on things and their burrito makers are the equivalent of kindergarteners trying to draw inside the circle. I've gone there multiple times and had my burrito looking more like a ball than anything resembling a burrito. Half the time I go there, the employees are just standing around which makes it weird that their supplies are ALWAYS low. They try to scrape the bottom of a crusty queso pan instead going to get a fresh one. Just a horrible place to eat. You're better off driving to the one in the Arboretum. THE WORST IN CHARLOTTE!"}
{"text":"Chipotle is worth the drive. The quality of Qdoba's chicken is consistently horrible. Chewy and fatty and quite gross."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving a two star rating is because the food is outstanding, otherwise it would definitely be a one. The service at this particular location is terrible, they rush you through the line with rudeness and carelessness. I visited this location this afternoon 4/11 and the kitchen area was a \"wreck\" with piled up dirty equipment and dishes. I definitely won't be returning to this location. Whoever owns this restaurant should really look into their hiring process because what their doing now isn't working."}
{"text":"My husband and I moved to the area about a year ago and frequent this Qdoba pretty often. Not sure why this place seems to have a bad rep on Yelp - we love it! 

There seems to be the same group of employees that work when we go - they're always really quick, friendly & funny. Our food comes out fast, the line moves quick and foods great."}
{"text":"This place is WAAAAAYYY better than chiplotle.Tacos And the rice are GREAT close to  pretty much EVERYTHING in birkdale,Right across from movies too ;)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with a coworker. Service was fast and food was good. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"When Qdoba originally opened we visited often and preferred it over Chipotle. I stopped by this last Saturday at 6:05 pm. The west side door had a not stating they would be closing at 7 pm to celebrate the Easter holiday. The windows were filthy, and the door was already locked. I knocked and no one answered. So much for closing at 7. On a previous visit I ordered a bowl to go and when I opened it to eat it the amount of food was crazy. There was barely enough food to call it a meal. This place definitely appears to be going in the wrong direction. Very disappointed as of late."}
{"text":"1) Let's start with food prep. You do not try to make 7 different food items for 3 different people. Food sits there, gets soggy and is cold by time you get it. Two people working out front and 1 lolly gagging around in the back. Poor in this area.

2) Since WHEN does the employee have a RIGHT to tell ME what I can and cannot have on my taco? I am legally purchasing food from your establishment. I was clearly told, sorry sir you cannot have salsa on your taco, we have to serve it on the side since Qdoba wants the customer to experience the chef selection. I can care less!!!! My money is buying your food. How dare your employees tell me no!!! You'd be lucky if I ever step foot in one of your restaurants ever again.  

3) It's not even summer anymore. You shouldn't have roaches...err...sorry...Palmetto Bugs crawling around on your floor. When I tell your staff to exterminate and you correct me on what I am telling you... stick it where the sun don't shine. Take care of the bug problem."}
{"text":"This Qdoba has changed since the earlier reviews. The staff was polite and helpful. My burrito was made exactly the way I asked. It was hot and delicious."}
{"text":"I've been to plenty of Qdoba's and this is hands down on the bottom of the list. The manager on day shift is very rude. Rest of the staff seems highly uninterested in being there. My work \"lunch buddy\" and I always used to eat at Qdoba before we changed locations, we tried eating her several times and just got tired of the manager and staff attitude. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I use to come here alot , till I ask for a request and the employees acts like they never done it before.  I asked the cook  if he can cook it for me, all his response is I don't know how.  Do the manager asked what I need I told him,  his response was so rude.  And he asked me who done it for me to give  the person's name so he can fire that person. I said no I'm not gonna give the name.  So I just walk away, I'm never going to that place again."}
{"text":"Knock out tacos are literally the best tacos my wife and I have ever had. They're unique combination make of ingredients gives them the feel of a smaller place . not to mention, Qdoba offers all toppings for free."}
{"text":"This is the best fast mexican food i have ever had. The staff is always very friendly and helpful. 

the Chicken Queso Burrito is amazing"}
{"text":"Great food! Fabulous service! Would recommend to anyone of my friends . The staff is very friendly and the food is fresh"}
{"text":"Door was locked at 8:00pm.. They close at 10.

One employee completely ignored the line while another spent about 12 minutes indulging an ADULT couple participating in KIDS eat free on Sunday, yes.. The man had a burrito & his woman got a kid bowl for free. He then made my food, ignored my children's menu questions & said they were both new & don't know anything... 

After the couple ahead of me got free food, I paid 26.00 for mine & then a dirty guy on a scooter comes in, after eating food out of the outside trash in front of us, and gets a burrito bowl & a soda for free... Guess I was the only one PAYING tonight.

I love Q'Doba in Tempe. It'll be nice when Ahwatukee finally gets it together with their staffing issues ... The food is always good. Service is always crap."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and the staff is always nice. Have done several catering events with them. They are very prompt and in time.

Taco Tuesday is very packed so get there before 12."}
{"text":"As far as quick, easy food goes, Qdoba gets it right.  The general concept is subway's build your own sandwich, but with Mexican food.  They have the right balance of healthy food options, quick service, and savory flavors.  The overall concept is similar to Chipotle, which is right next door.  What sets Qdoba apart for me is their Queso, which now comes in 6 flavors, and which Chipotle does not have.  Also of note, this location offers the Coca-cola flavor shot machine allowing you to make your own flavors of soda.  UPMC employee's get a 99 cent drink.  All toppings are now included in the price, allowing you to get things like queso and guacamole at no extra cost.  There is plenty of seating, both indoors and outdoors."}
{"text":"This is a really great concept and the food is great. Anytime we are in Chandler we stop here. We love all the options and things you can add to your plate at no extra charge. The staff is nice and food is always great. We wish there was a location in Tucson. I had the tacos and was able to do 2 chicken and 1stake and both meats were delicious. We Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"If I was the franchise owner, I would highly recommend all cashiers take a business and customer service course. I stopped into this location and ordered a burrito bowl. As I order, I am told there is no rice of any kind. So I make my way to the end of the ordering station and up to the cashier. Chicken burrito, lettuce, hot salsa, black beans, and shredded cheese. The cashier proceeded to charge me $8.xx for a basic burrito bowl without even the most basic ingredient. (Who runs out of rice?) I told him, I don't think so. 8 anything is over priced to begin with and you're unable to offer a basic ingredient. I will be happy to continue with 10% off and he says no, full price or nothing. Here's where the kid who is likely going to the UW should have enough common sense to say, we can make 90% and still satisfy our customer, or we can miss the sale, waste product, and of course take a 10-30% loss. I proceeded to say you're unable to offer your full product, I will be satisfied with 10% off or it's no deal. He proceeds to put a lid on the bowl (more money wasted) and throws the bowl in the trash. Good job bud. Way to make your franchise owner proud."}
{"text":"Qdoba recently made it s return to the campus. This time its located in the basement of the union where that sushi restaurant used to be. 

Unfortunately, Qdoba continues to dissapoint. Its prices are shockingly high, 7.40 for a chicken bowl or 8.50 for a steak bowl. For such a price you'd expect quality food, but instead its like eating a less fresh and less flavorful Chipotle. Considering that chipotle isnt known for being very flavorful, you can use your imagination about how good qdoba's food is. 

Luckily, there was no line at qdoba when I went today, whereas chipotle almost always has a line. If you're in a rush and craving pseudo mexican food, then this might be acceptable, otherwise I'd recommend going to Maize or, at worst, Chipotle."}
{"text":"In a simple words better than chipotle. Fresh air.. And their food is fresh... Good ambience .. Staffs are friendly ... Very near to Walmart ... A great place to have dinner ."}
{"text":"Great taco salad!! Mango salsa is amazing !"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong I love Qdoba but this particular location did not have a welcoming vibe and the reason why I came here was not available. I arrived at 1 pm and they were out of the grilled corn for the day and the lady tried charging me extra for the guacamole (since I asked twice about the corn I'm guessing and was extremely rude and seemed as if she hated her job) but I knew Qdoba doesn't charge extra so.. Worst Qdoba experience here. Unless you like rude people making your food, don't come to this Qdoba."}
{"text":"I could probably eat Qdoba everyday and be completely satisfied. Burritos are truly one of my favorite foods and Qdoba's are fantastic. I like the fact that it is made in front of you so you can see the freshness of the ingrediants and customize your burrito anyway you would like. I usually get a burrito but they also have delicious quesadillas and nachos. The chips and queso are also a great compliment to your meal. The service is also great, I have never had any issues. I would recommend trying a naked burrito and their guacamole."}
{"text":"Was disappointed, food was just ok, and very overpriced.
I will say the staff are very nice.
Won't be back."}
{"text":"I have actually always had great experiences at this one with no complaints. Food, service, and cleanliness was always above par."}
{"text":"I really like Qdoba Grill. For those who have not been to Qdoba before, the concept is similar to Chipotle. Burritos, Salads, Quesadillas, Tacos, Nachos. Select your item, pick a meat, select from an \"assembly line\" of ingredients. The ingredients are flavorful and fresh and I've never been disappointed with a meal from here. Great for a quick lunch or dinner. 

My favorites are:

Naked Burrito - just means it comes in a bowl without the tortilla
Queso Burrito - perfect medicine for a hangover
Grilled Chicken Taco Salad - sans the crunchy tortilla bowl

Favorite ingredients are:

Blackbeans - protein rich goodness
Corn Salsa
Pico de Gallo - fat free low cal volume

This particular location is ok. I've been to a few other locations and the staff is more friendly and \"giving\" on the portions, but overall this is a good location. Typically I come here for lunch so realistically the portions they are providing for LUNCH are sufficient."}
{"text":"I've never been to a place with a more apathetic staff. They would rather watch Cartoon Network on the tv and play with their phones than acknowledge your existence. They already have a disadvantage since they aren't chipotle and they aren't doing themselves any favors. Avoid."}
{"text":"Love it here, super friendly, close to my house, and there's almost never a line. Great food!!!! I always get a burrito."}
{"text":"They sent me an email for a buy 1 get 1 free smothered burrito for Valentine's day, so I decided to go in to take advantage of the offer. Then they refused to give me the offer because they said I don't have a friend with me and I can't take advantage of the buy 1 get 1 free by myself. Waste of my time, as the sole reason I went in on this day was to take advantage of the email offer they sent me. Great way to keep your customers Qdoba."}
{"text":"I've had no huge complaints on the food here. After Chipotle getting rid of chorizo & adding a dumpster sauce they call queso I've decided to make qdoba my go to. It's 5 minutes away and just convenient for a quick eat.

I prefer burrito bowls or loaded nachos & every time I've been fairly happy. Only complaint would be their chicken. 
 I've tried both chicken options they sell and each time I received overcooked chicken. Overcooked or sat for hours, who knows. Tough to chew, some grit, no thank you.

Real complaint is the employees. Line full of people, 1 person prepping & 1 older white guy showing off his chest hair walking around talking on his cell phone trying to figure out if the person is coming over tomorrow. Some employees actually do work so it's not a complaint against everyone.

Almost every time I've ordered online they didn't \"realize\" I ordered until I was there to pick up. Not a huge issue for me because I rather my food be hot than sit for 15 minutes prior to my arrival time. Still skip the line. 

With improved professionalism of employees & a fresh'er version of chicken my rating would go up. I love the loaded nachos & will continue eating here though."}
{"text":"I like this place.  It can be packed during lunch but occasionally there is a lull and you can have your pick of seats.   The dining room is open and cheery, clean and comfortable. 

The rice bowls come with a choice of brown or white rice...a choice of their yummy queso if you want it (yes please I do), and then chicken or beef, choice of black beans or pinto (both are good so I get a combo)....ingredients are fresh.  

A chicken bowl (Queso Burrito Chicken Bowl) is $7.80  -see photo
I don't think they charge extra for sour cream but might want to ask before you get it just in case.

Tacos are small but good and fresh ingredients.  

The queso dip can be ordered separately too.  There is no price on the menu board but you can get a little cup for $1.50 and then a larger cup (which is priced up on the menu board) is $4.00 .   I would recommend to order a couple of the different ones in the small size so you can taste the different dips.  They have a new one called \"cheeseburger\" queso right now."}
{"text":"The employees are really nice here. The food is good. I prefer it over Chipotle. They have a nice rewards program. But I wish they would use all white-meat chicken. And a soft corn tortilla would be nice for the burritos for people who are gluten-free."}
{"text":"Was a good place till I went to this location! Server didn't care about the making anything good or fresh I wouldn't feed my the dog the food she put together won't ever step into QDOBA again. Killed everything eating hard rice?!? Like that's nasty"}
{"text":"Wow, how awful can this place be.  

First I walked in at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon and there were 3 people in line ahead of me.  Nearly 10 minutes later my nachos were being started.  It would have been faster to drive to Mexico City to get my food.

I ordered nachos.  Chips, cheese, rice and veggies.  Let's not forget the pint of sour cream they dumped on them.  Seriously, the sour cream was cold, and there was so much of it that it was running down the outside of the bowl.  The nacho chips became soggy in 5 minutes and then the entire bowl of nachos were tossed in the Qdoba garbage can.  It took longer to get the food then it did to dispose of it.  The soda was horrid too and had more syrup than Aunt Jamima.  All for the low, low price of $10.13.  I really took it in the shorts here, and the poor english speaking staff could have cared less.

I think I'd gladly walk across East Washington Ave, and feel like Frogger, take the risk of dodging the cars and go to Chipole next time I want this style of Mexican fare.  Knowing I might get hit by a bus trying to avoid this Qdoba location should tell you just how much it sucks."}
{"text":"Food was cold paid 8 $ for three tacos with 1 tacos worth of meat spread across them a couple shreds of lettuce on each and half the cheese they should've had even though I paid for extra cheese. Do yourself a favor and go to taco bell. I'm never coming back here to throw my money away."}
{"text":"I just got back from qdoba in the south side. It was a terrible experience.  I received buy one get one entree coupons, so I've been using them on fridays with a co worker. Today I went (another friday) with my gf and used the coupon, but the cashier said I can't use it on discount days that they have, even though I've used them three times already on fridays.  The cashier was the same one that let me use them the other times too and no where on the coupon does it say anything about what she stated. I was frustrated, but paid full price for both meals.  She was really unpleasant and not accommodating. Then for some reason they threw away my gf's quesadilla, so they had to make another one. When she got the new one it was all slop and had no veggies on it that she requested.  They all fell off on the grill. I will not be coming back to this establishment ever again unless they get new staff and honor their coupons."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised there aren't more reviews for this place. We had a great first impression just walking in the door. The staff was very nice and friendly. My boyfriend and I both got chicken burritos bad some chops with queso. Everything was very good. We will definitely be back here"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight , never been before, won't EVER go back! The sign on the menu clearly states 3 tacos for $9.00. But I was charged $10.50 for the 3 tacos we ordered. After My family sat down to eat I went to question the charges. The person I dealt with was completely disrespectful and told me the reason the price was different was because of tax. When I told him that didn't make any sense, because the tax was also charged at the bottom of the receipt he then asked me to look at it on the screen with him. He charged me $3.50 3 times ($10.50) and then hit total, again claiming the tax was making the charge more than advertised. BUT at the bottom of the screen it showed the price (including tax) was actually over $11 with tax, again proving he was wrong. I continued to state my case, they were clearly false advertising and I wasn't going to accept his BS story. He reluctantly opened the register and gave me $1.00, but I was owed $1.50! I demanded the additional $0.50 and he complied, slamming the register and giving me a nasty looks as I turned to walk away. There are too many good places out there that don't rip off their customers, I'll take my business elsewhere!"}
{"text":"As the four stars would imply, I'm a fan of Qdoba.  

Nothing against other places like Moe's, Salsarita's and Chipotle, I just think Qdoba tastes a lot better.

They have multiple types of burritos that you can order with tortilla or without (saves you a surprising amount of calories).  They also have quesadillas, nachos, soups, etc.

Recommendations:  Naked BBQ Chicken burrito.  It's sort of amazing.

Not sure of how long this will last or if it's just this location, but they have Buy One Get One Free Burritos at the Woodlawn/Park location."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying a New Mexican restaurant for take out. A place to get a nice burrito. However, this didn't turn out to be the place! The woman behind the counter spoiled the experience! When I told her I was new to Qdoba and unfamiliar with the process, she didn't seem to care and just kept asking \" what else do you want ?\". She never explained what the ingredients were, or what the options were. Very frustrating! They were also out of several ingredients. Two burritos and a taco salad cost $25 without tax, and that didn't include drinks or chips! I don't believe I'll ever return!"}
{"text":"I pretty much lived on this stuff for a year. The service was always great and the prices are good. The veggie nachos are great, they load them up with queso. If you order chips & salsa you'll get a bag of chips so huge you won't be able to finish them."}
{"text":"Clean and easy. 

Based on all the reviews it seems that this place is a mixed bag. I, for one, was pleasantly surprised. The eating area is clean with a nice layout. The service was quick and pleasant.  

I ordered a big burrito that featured a BBQ sauce. Can't remember the name, but it had a lot of flavor. The ingredients were very fresh and the tortilla was literally bursting at the seams with meat, rice, beans, veggies and sauce. 

I don't care about the Chipotle vs. The World debate. It is what it is. The quality of the food at Qdoba stands on its own and that's all that matters.

They really should have a salsa bar though."}
{"text":"This was not a good experience. The food is alright, but service was terrible. I walked into a very dirty looking place, received a very messily made bowl, and was treated like I was bothering the staff. When my girlfriend asked the difference between the two types of chicken, the guy working said, \"it's pretty much the same thing, but one has seasoning\". All in all, it was a disappointing experience and we probably won't come back."}
{"text":"With all of the hype (and controversy) surrounding Chipotle, it's easy to forget about this little hidden gem. Service can be a little on the slow side but the food is always worth the extra wait. Nothing beats free Guacamole & Sour Cream, especially considering most similar spots charge $1.50 extra for each. It's the usual Beef, Pork, and Chicken offerings with good sized portions. The shredded pork in green sauce is my personal favorite, but all of them hit the spot. A Good location just  a few blocks from the 215 freeway. Check it out."}
{"text":"The last few times I have been there the staff has been horrible. The don't pay attention and then when I ask again for them to add something I already asked for they give an attitude. The food isn't that great to have to deal with staff that don't care. Chipotle is the better option anyways for fast food Mexican in Oakland."}
{"text":"Great food for lunch. Always fresh and clean. Service is excellent. The manager lady is always a friendly and a pleasure to deal with. Staff is focused and nice to deal with. Order whatever you want with the queso sauce on it!"}
{"text":"Very good burritos,huge,good taste and price... Very clean..I also liked the soda machine!"}
{"text":"Bad Food Prep

This evening my friend purchased a chicken burrito to go. When she got home it fell apart and had to unwrap and rewrap it to eat it. So I took the liberty of calling the store to inform them of the situation. I explained that my friend had just purchased a burrito and it fell apart when she picked it up to take a bite. His response was \"okay,\" followed by silence. I told him she had to eat it with a fork (which defeats the whole purpose of ordering a burrito), to which he replied \"okay.\" Then I asked if I can come back to get another one (on the house of course) and he said sure and asked when I'd like to come back. I responded \"next weekend.\" He said \"okay, I'll be here.\" Then I asked his name - he replied Alex. I asked if he was the manager - he replied yes. Huh? So the entire time I was speaking to the manager? Bottom line, the food was ill-prepared and the customer service provided by THE MANAGER was horrific. Thanks Alex, but my friend and I will not be returning. We're more than happy to spend our money at a competitor."}
{"text":"They food is very fresh, not overcooked or stale. Very clean environment. Staff is friendly and greet you with a smile .  That says alot"}
{"text":"First time to Qdoba yesterday. It was great! They aren't stingy at all with their portions. If you ask for more they give it to you. And guac is not extra. It is also delicious. I will be back. Even tastes good leftover and cold. Unlike chipotle."}
{"text":"Love the food and it's a great price. The food as yet to dissatisfied me! It's always very quick too if you're on a lunch break. Very clean environment and nice outside patio for nice days when you want to sit somewhere clean and non crowded."}
{"text":"Tania is amazing! So nice even at 1:00am when customers are annoying! Also their queso is still better than Chipotle's"}
{"text":"Great food as always with this chain! The restaurant was initially hard to find as the sign out front was burned out. Thankfully the signs in the windows were working."}
{"text":"Going to Walmart, I've passed by this place many times, so I finally decided to try them out. It's sort of cafeteria style, with food sitting in hot plates or broths, so it's not fresh or really even authentic Mexican food. I wasn't impressed. The pull-pork came out of this broth that seemed days old. Now that I know, I'll just stick with Faustos Mexican food, which is practically across the street."}
{"text":"TLDR: food is great, service is not.

I came here during busy lunch hours, which was probably my mistake.  I ordered a briskey quesadilla, which was delicious.  The server was really generous with the toppings, and it tasted quite delicious.  When I got to the cashier to pay and also order some queso, I had asked some questions about how I could order, but the cashier wasn't as nice about answering them.  Especially this being my first time ordering the way I did, I wish they were nicer about answering my questions."}
{"text":"Ugh I got a veg nacho and they just turned it into slop.  So much liquid cheese and wet salsa that it was soggy and the chips weren't crisp at all.  I couldn't eat it it wasn't a nacho, it was just a disproportionate amount of toppings.  Normally that wouldn't bother me but it does when you can't find a chip to pick up the toppings with.  Shredded cheese would have been better than the melted cheese...it liquified the chip.  It was just kinda gross"}
{"text":"I mean when you've eaten at one QDOBA you've eaten at them all amirite?

The staff here are pleasant and were patient with me while I waited for data so I could show them my rewards code from the QDOBA app on my phone (sign up if you want freebies!).

I usually get the fajita veggies here and at Chipotle and I do wish that they would slice them a little thinner here and maybe cook it a bit longer, heck I'd even settle for them to be warm. Yup, they were cold even though they're in a warmer with the rest of the fixins'.

But what gets me to come back every time is that Guac is free!!"}
{"text":"I'm having an internal debate right now. Has Chipotle become less relevant? Is Qdoba due a triumphant nod?

Hard to say, I feel as though Qdoba gives you way more food and doesn't judge you when you ask for extras.

The Smoked Brisket I had can rival Barbacoa any day of the week.

You also get FREE queso and FREE GUAC!!!!

Plus now they have this delightful pineapple pico that's making me crush hard.

I also feel Qdoba has a more rewarding rewards system than Chipotle.

Well I guess from what I noted above... color me a convert!

...at least for now ( °  °)"}
{"text":"Unless you eat the beans in their dishes, there's not enough food for the expense of it. I ordered without beans, not much food for my $9.  I took my lunch back to work and had to add supplemental chicken, cheese, and lettuce to actually have enough food to call lunch. Pathetic. Cheapskates. For a $9 lunch, I'll take my money elsewhere if you're not going to give me enough for a meal. 3 ounces of chicken, 6 strands of romaine shreds, and a small amount of shredded cheese isn't worth $9."}
{"text":"This corporation cheats their customers at every turn. Their rewards program is a lie. Their rewards offers are not given and the customer is charged full price, while the receipt tells you there should be a reward given. Fix your rewards program or discontinue it, but stop lying and \"offering\" rewards that cannot be redeemed."}
{"text":"This location has a sign on the door advertising kids eat free every Sunday.  Most free kids' meal deals I've seen are not on weekends, so that's nice."}
{"text":"The staff here is absolutely awful. Out of the last 10 times I was only happy about 1 time with my order. They move so slow and are consistently messing up the order even though you just told them it. They're constantly on their phones and almost seem stoned half the time

The one bright spot in the staff is this kid cole( I think?? he has glasses). He just started (we go about once a week for food) He is friendly and attentive.

The food is sub par compared to chipotle, but better than moe's in my opinion. Will I continue to go back? Yeah. But only because it's closer than chipotle.

They'd get more stars if their staff wasn't so bad"}
{"text":"First, qdoba is delicious. Second, this particular location has free parking which is odd for a place in the city. So it gets half the stars just for that. The qdoba in Oakland has zero parking. Third, it's right next to a chipotle in case you change your mind between parking and ordering. 

Finally qdoba has quesso, it's delicious and the only reason I go. We can all agree that both chipotle and qdoba are magnificent and we don't need all this hate and vitriol in the burrito eating community. Burritos come from a place of love."}
{"text":"At first I was not a believer of the Qdoba experience... but now I am, this is a more particular review of this location as I will go more in depth of the food in another review. This location is ok, it has a very odd line system but it feels really really large. The only real problem that I have with this place is that the Whiskey Jacks Saloon is right next door and their line can go right up to the Qdoba door so you have to walk through a wall of drunken people just to get into the restaraunt. It is relatively clean and is in a great spot for a quick late-night dinner after being out on the town."}
{"text":"I am totally for being bilingual, i am , Lady at the counter couldn't understand anything I was saying because she spoke Spanish.  Gave me the smallest amount of everything and then the lady at register was extremely rude.  Sitting down two people came in and three of them and none of them said hello or acknowledged them. Something needs to get fixed."}
{"text":"Serving sizes are definitely worth the price...Although I fail to understand why it's an extra 50 cents for ranchero sauce and a few other menu options when your already paying close to ten bucks just for a burrito. Compare that to Chipotle and it doesn't seem worth it. Otherwise good overall experience. A/C sounds like a jumbo jet on steroids."}
{"text":"Expected food, hurried service, good atmosphere. I went here with my family for a quick lunch, the woman serving our food seemed to be in a hurry but what else do you expect in a fast-food restaurant? The food was as expected but would've been nice if it was warmer. The tables were clean and there was plenty of space to sit and eat which was nice. I'm still a Chipotle fan but Qdoba comes to a close second for me."}
{"text":"Food is good but the tacos are wayy overpriced for what you get... at least the 3 cheese nacho bowl was good for the price. Got a brownie also...it sort of tastes like a brownie but not really..

The place is clean... but the music is horrible. We about left mid-meal due to it. Don't know what the ____ type of music they played tonight but it was downright terrible.. 

We won't return."}
{"text":"Food is good but the menu seems to keep changing. Desperately needs an a la carte option. Craft 2 option won't let you mix and match certain items, so it's just an illusion of choice."}
{"text":"This is a very very nasty store I went there one day and didn't buy nothing but I hate some of my friends and it made me sick it didn't even look good"}
{"text":"I give this restaurant 1 star the food is good but the employee that serves the food are some cheap ass people especially this young black girl everything they put is little of it especially the chicken not even a full scoop she fills it up than only puts half of it and puts the rest back that's why I love Chipotle some location there are cheap people everywhere you go I wasn't even full a little after eating here
This is Last time coming here I'm very disappointed and it's more expensive than Chipotle.. Chipotle is the place to go at least I get full over there"}
{"text":"Have been here several times to eat. Service is almost to fast which is fine. Always have to try to find a table that's been cleaned, garbage cans are always overflowing and floors mainly carpet is always covered with food. The food is always pretty good though I like to eat in a cleaned area."}
{"text":"So today I ordered lunch from Qdoba through Foodsby and, although my order was wrong the last time, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and ordered again.  So that's where I went wrong.  Their ability to f*ck up an order is spectacular.  I ordered the Taco Salad Bowl, no shell, no  beans, add pico, guac, sour cream and steak.  I got my order and it's in a shell, with extra beans, peppers, no pico, no sour cream, steak that tastes and looks a lot like the chicken I didn't order and about a half ton of quac on top.  I'm assuming this quac roof is some attempt to cover up the hot mess that lies beneath.  There are so many beans in this thing that my rice turned purple.  I keep getting bites of this weird beige gelatinous stuff and then I realize it's actually that f*cking shell that has become a thick layer of dough from the weight of the beans and quac.  I also just dropped a 15 foot long piece of bell pepper on my chest.  I didn't' even know you could get a bell pepper outside of a fajita.  It's like I've stepped into this alternate backwards reality.  I keep waiting for Ashton Kutcher to jump out and tell me I'm being punked.  Is that show even still on in reruns?  I don't have time to go get anything else and I'm starving at work so as I sit here and eat this bowl of mostly stuff I hate, it has occurred to me that maybe this order isn't even mine.  Maybe they put the wrong name on the bag because there is no way you could just mess up something this bad. I asked around and everyone confirmed that I am in fact who I think I am so I'm gonna go ahead and assume that Qdoba f*cked up my order for the last time.  If you need me I'll be over in a corner of the office trying to find someone to blame all the gas I'm gonna be expelling after eating this bucket of beans."}
{"text":"Took the family there for the first time. I had been there before, but this visit left me not wanting to come back. The place was empty, save for a family of four. The girl working the line asked what we wanted and when my daughters said they weren't sure, my wife said it was there first time here, causing said girl to roll her eyes at us. After taking our order, I gave my money to the unenthusiastic manager, who seemed just as annoyed with my family as the girl working the line. Food good, customer service bad. Back to Chipotle or Moe's I guess."}
{"text":"Must have good management because you can tell all the employees are helpful and happy. Food is good here. I prefer it over tasteless chipotle."}
{"text":"Not sure if I came on a bad night or just came to the wrong restaurant but the food was tasteless. You're better off spending the money at Chipotle. Bad first impression, will probably never eat at a QDOBA again."}
{"text":"According to the employees on Sunday the 25th.  They are closing for good tomorrow."}
{"text":"The entire first experience was exceptional.. the staff passed me over to the manager who allowed me to sample all of the wonderful quesos they offer. The staff was very engaging and accommodating. The atmosphere was very clean and welcoming and they even suggested different fountain drinks. I will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"I tried Qdoba to compare it to Chipotle. I got the bowl with the grilled chicken. You definitely get more for the money, everything is included. At chipotle you have to pay extra for guacamole. Qdoba also has a better selection of meat. I'm going to try the brisket next or pulled pork. I'm glad I gave this place a try, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Qdoba Who?
Funniest thing happened, as I walked into a Qdoba I felt like i walked into a chipotle. Yes, same thing. Except that I had no idea what Qdoba means, (and I'm Mexican) but it looks more like a middle eastern word.
  The concept at Qdoba:  All the ingredients are laid out in front of you. You pick  from burrito to tacos or just a bowl or naked burrito, you pick your protein, steak, chicken or pork and last you pick all your toppings and you have a meal. A very good  Quality meal for a very good price, fast!
 I really like the location there is plenty of parking  and right across from my favorite star bucks. The place is clean and the service is also great. Great for quick lunch or a nice casual dinner with friends.

  Some \"useful,\" information. The word Qdoba has no meaning, it was created by Qdoba marketing because two previous names they used were already being used by someone else. \"funny\" so they decided to come up with a unique name and they ended up with Qdoba.\"cool\""}
{"text":"I just ordered food for delivery from Uber eats and after eating about half of my burrito realize there's no steak on my steak burrito and there was no queso on any of the items I ordered never ordering from there again"}
{"text":"Qdoba...enough said. It's a chain that has Mexican food. Walk up to the bar, pick tacos, a burrito or a bowl. Pick your protein. Pick your toppings (up to 10). Get a drink. Pay. Walk out. It's simple and predictable, but sometimes that's what you want.

This location is clean and always somewhat busy. I've been in at 5 pm and I've been in at 9:30 pm. Always good service and the food seems to always be fresh. Recently, I've begun using their app to order ahead, so it's ready to grab right when I arrive."}
{"text":"Love it here! The only Qdoba I end up visiting just because I like the people who work here so much! The food is always consistently good and the service is always quick. I love their craft 2 option! No complaints."}
{"text":"I came across Qdoba for the first time when I was in Philadelphia. I liked it a lot just because they have more options and many healthy choices on their menu. I can put it in the same category as Chipotle sometimes but somehow they are not as good as Chipotle. In comparison to Chipotle, they do not have good ambiance and sometimes their food does not feel or look as fresh as Chipotle. This particular location is very small and I did not like as much as I liked the one on Walnut street in Philadelphia. I still liked their Gumbo which remains my favorite Mexican dish and that is the only reason I go to Qdoba. For everything else I just to to Chipotle or other independent restaurants."}
{"text":"Continues its downward spiral. Subpar service with completely enthusiastic employees. Always out of something; fajita onions & peppers. Food prep is questionable with the rice not cooked properly on most occasions. Most of the time the chips are greasy and undercooked. Gross. The queso is the only saving grace. Skip it and go to Chipotle and come back here for the queso."}
{"text":"I Love this place! The people are normally very nice. The food is always pretty good. Very good value when they put out coupons. I always get the naked burrito and i never regret it."}
{"text":"Came here after workingout. I ordered the grilled chicken burrito bowl. The ingredients were super fresh. They have the Coca-Cola freestyle machine which is awesome! They offer a military discount as well!"}
{"text":"Qdoba is the best! In my opinion, they're way better than Chipotle and the staff is always so friendly. A lot of times I've gone here after class for lunch and the line has been pretty long, but I never find myself waiting for longer than 5 minutes because the staff is so quick and efficient. 

In addition, their queso dip is phenomenal!! They have a few different kinds, although I always just get their three cheese queso as it's delicious and my favorite burrito bowl topping. Their guacamole is pretty good too and the nice plus is that they don't charge a ridiculous $2 fee like Chipotle does for theirs. This place is definitely one of my favorite places to get lunch after or before class."}
{"text":"This place is great. Says I checked in once but I've been here 5 times. The food is good, fresh, and decently healthy. Free guacamole! No one offers that. I'm vegetarian and there's still so much to eat there. I can't stand Cilantro so unlike chipotle I can choose NOT to have it in every ingredient. The turn off to chipotle was an employee told me \"All Mexican food has Cilantro in it.\"  Wrong thing to tell me as I am Mexican and it just not true."}
{"text":"I have to say that I am never disappointed with my food at Qdobas.  Three things keep me coming back to a restaurant,  good food, friendly workers and a clean place to sit and eat.  My table was clean as was all the others but 80% of the seats were covered food and the floor was dirty everywhere.  Before I sat I had to clean my own chair.  your employees were polite but not friendly.  Will I come back?  Not rushing back..."}
{"text":"I love the food and everything about this place. Great food and great customer service. The food has good taste and flavorful. The burrito is hugh and the staff are nice. The atmosphere is good and a very clean place to eat. I would go back...and I have."}
{"text":"Typical corporate location.  I was in a group that had some taco.  They were nicely prepared and tasty.  Service was efficient, but could have been a bit more friendly.  Oh well, it was a holiday weekend.  Problem; this unit needs a cleanup.  Bathrooms were particularly poor.  Please."}
{"text":"Don't be intimidated by the line at this place come lunch time on a week day, it moves very quick with the Uptown lunch crowd, Efficient service anytime I've gone here although when they first opened I was in sensory overload with them yelling \"Black or pinto beans? Chicken, beef or pork? all at one time. Solid, quick food with reasonable prices and it's always a toss up in between their nachos with the delectable cheese sauce that I sometimes want to sip through a straw and a burrito the size of a youngin. They honor coupons found in the paper and online, which is always a plus. They have an outdoor patio facing Blumenthal Theater which is a nice little escape as opposed to some of the eateries in The Ivy that don't offer a view or any outdoor seating. Nice to have an alternative from Salsarita's Uptown (Oh yeah, Wednesdays are $4 Margarita day) and they have muchos bottles of Cholula and that stuff just rocks."}
{"text":"I love the portions you get for the price!! Ingredients were fresh and the staff was very friendly!!"}
{"text":"Came in for a burrito and the employee behind the counter talked me into something different. His name was Connor and he was exceptional at his job. I have worked in the customer service industry for 13 years, and managed employees for 9 of those. This man went so far above and beyond my expectations I was inclined to offer him a job on the spot. He took great pride in his work, and made me the best food I've ever had from a QSR. 
I stop into a Qdoba a few times a month after getting off work, usually around 9 or 10, after most of the other restaurants in the area have closed. This fine young gentleman ensured I will be returning to his restaurant much more often in the future. 
It's amazing how a great service experience can change everything you fell about a restaurant. Qdoba had always been a place that gets the job done well enough when I need food in a hurry, but with employees like Connor, they truly stepped it up to a couple notches. 
I'll return again (and again and again) to have my tacos and burritos made with care by the team at this particular location."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is painfully slow.  The dining area lately has been filthy with dirty tables and overflowing trash cans. 
The employees are very nice but should use time more wisely"}
{"text":"They advertise  coupons and then don't honor them. It happened to me on two different coupons and the woman cashier blamed \"corporate\"."}
{"text":"Go here all of the time. The food is great and always on point. The staff is excellent and very friendly. The sweet woman that works there even recommended a dish that I never tried before and I now order it very regularly. I love Chipotle (still do) but think this place is way better."}
{"text":"Obviously, this place is very similar to Chipotle but in regards to flavor this place slightly edges out Chipotle for me. For one, you can order nachos with an actual 3 cheese queso as opposed to just grated cheese at Chipotle. Also, when you get a salad here it comes in a tortilla bowl score! The service at this location can be spotty at times but bear with them because the food is worth the wait. Also, this location gives out $6 meal coupons on the back of Safeway receipts ( the meal coupon  includes any entrée and a drink for only $6 buck, can't beat that with a stick!). The actual dining area is okay, but again their service needs work so sometimes you will see dirty tables. Overall, I'd say find the coupons, use them and get your food to-go, BOOM!"}
{"text":"Ya know it's mediocre. It's way better than chipotle, not to mention the risk you take of getting e-coli when you go to chipotle. I love that queso and guacamole are free and for some reason everything tastes better as well. It's about the same price as getting a combo meal at a fast food joint, but definitely a better and healthier alternative. The sizing of the burritos and bowls really all depend on what you get. I jack pack mine full with just about everything under the sun, so I usually end up with a really fat burrito or a bowl towered high. It's nothing special, but definitely a much better alternative to chipotle or moes."}
{"text":"How the heck did I manage to spend over $8 for a grilled chicken burritto and a drink?!  I know.  I WAS RIPPED-OFF!!  How does this chain manage to stay in business?!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite before heading out across the Mojave in the early evening hours.  For a Saturday night the place was not very busy and make for a quick order and food retrieval.  The staff was friendly.  The environment was clean. The food was A-OK.  I guess I am just not a fan of Qdoba cuisine.  It's not that the food sucks....it's just a little to bland for my taste.  It does not matter how much I spice it up, the overall meal to me seems to be lacking a particular ingredient."}
{"text":"I think most people in the valley are familiar with burritos so this is more of a thumbs up for this location. The main reason I come here is for the vegetarian pinto beans ( the other burrito place adds delicious pork ).  The veggie burritos are good and they aren't cheap with the guacamole.  The service lately is kind of hit or miss and they are always low on stuff.  THey are always really friendly, but they need to puck up the food prep planning a bit."}
{"text":"Solid burrito, taco, quesadilla joint.  I generally put Chipotle above Qdoba, but the food and service at this location is quite good.  

My one gripe is that they don't put enough meat in their tacos.  However, that seems to be a Qdoba-wide issue and not specific to this location.

I downgraded my rating a bit, as they did away w/ Taco Tuesday, $5 burrito Friday, and the complimentary drinks for UPMC employees. Sorry, guys...your restaurant is less of a value for me now."}
{"text":"Just no sense of urgency at all. None. How can this place even stay open. The food is good, like all Qdobas, but the workers just refuse to put any effort in. Chipotle has to see triple the customers"}
{"text":"Enough with the nit-picky over-charging nonsense! While I really enjoy the food, it is so annoying to have them scrimp on each ingredient, charge for double if you ask for extra, or $1 up charge for a lot of components. I would rather be charged a higher base price and then get whatever toppings I want. I've known this about Qdoba, which is why I took a three year hiatus. But I had to learn the hard way again today. 

On the plus side, the tortilla soup is great. I got the gumbo, which comes with rice and beans. I only wanted a small spoon of rice and no beans but I asked for extra broth when I saw that the bowl was only 1/2 full. You would've thought I asked for something unreasonable. The guy did deign to give me a half spoonful more, which still left my bowl half empty. Don't think about adding fajita vegetables or add another $1. Guacamole...$1. Queso...$1. Pretty soon, you'll have a $10 half full bowl of soup. 

I'm officially done with Qdoba. Moe's and Johnny Burrito are just as good or better and they charge one base price for their items with whatever toppings you want."}
{"text":"Disgusting lazy employees.... So we go in for the first time ever and only one couple in there eating. We were greeted and started the order,  four steak bowls. Only one serving of peppers available which my wife ordered and when we asked for some peppers on the other three bowls they said they had none left and it will be ten minutes to make some,  OK  so we proceed to build our bowls while two employees are carrying on a conversation instead of working. One of the employees lounging in the kitchen arrived for her shift with us but I guess she already needed a break before working , go figure. When we asked to speak to the manager she arrived in all her glory and said its only going to be a few minutes for peppers. Ummmmmmm so why weren't they made ten minutes ago when you ran out? No apologies, so we simply left. First time there, last time back. Lazy idiots"}
{"text":"Wow just wow.  I haven't been to a Qdoba in a while and finally had an opportunity to take my better half there ( she is a chipotle fan) and try it. I was super excited but 5 mins in line and I knew this wasn't the same Qdoba.

Their menu used to be simple. Now they have all these options, cheese whiz in your burro?  Gross.  Anyhow I went with the basic. Steak burro, white rice, corn salsa, cheese and black beans. 

Steak had little to no flavor.  Rice was just as bland, the amount of celantro in the rice was minimal. The corn salsa was good.  Cheese is cheese.  Black beans were so so too. 

She has the grill chicken burro, same setup as mine. Chicken was like rubber with no flavor.

Where is the flavor?  I had to use damn near a quarter bottle of hot sauce. 
 

Very disappointed.  Sad to say that chipotle has a better burro..  We won't be back"}
{"text":"I noticed a previous review of a disrespectful manager at this store. Something very similar happened to me. This quote \"MANAGER\" should go back to training. I asked her her name when she was being rude. Her name is ALY. I have been in the restaurant business for years and if I were  the owner I would want to know about one of my Young managers was not representing my store as I would expect. When I was in she did the same type of thing \"Rolled her Eyes\"and acted like I was an inconvenience. I normally like the food but the experience makes me think twice about recommending my friends or going back myself. Once you have been treated this way no food tastes good. Hopefully the owner will address this young disrespectful \"MANAGER\". There are many choices on where to spend my families hard earned money when eating out or ordering to go. This ALY at Qdoda makes it hard to return. 
Shame on her.
Good luck if you visit.
Paul"}
{"text":"I love Qdoba. We get the Craft 2 and chips and queso and 2 drinks with free refills for around $20,bucks and it's more than enough for a quick meal. The Craft 2 gives you 2 tacos and choice of another item so we get the quesidilla. Yummy."}
{"text":"Qdoba is about as authentically Mexican as Harris Teeter-brand salsa, but that doesn't detract from its brand one bit. The food is delicious and the servings are American-sized, which is a wonderful combination.

I showed up to this locations right before closing. I know that's not the best way to experience any establishment, but I was impressed that no one hurried us out the door. It was clean, the staff were friendly, and the food was as fresh and you can reasonably expect in the middle of the night."}
{"text":"My family of 6 loves Mexican food, even when it is semi-authentic. Qdoba Mexican Grill is a chain restaurant that offers Mexican-American food like burritos, tacos, and nachos, at the speed of most fast food joints. My husband and boys love the Chicken Queso Burrito, while I prefer a more vegetarian burrito or taco salad w/o the chicken. Both are typically decent here. 

We have been to the Huntersville (Birkdale Village) location, the University City location, and the S. Tryon location. S. Tryon is fairly clean, but not as clean as the other two locations based upon several of our visits. On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being spotless, this restaurant ranks around a 5-6, while the other two locations are more of a 6.5-7. My biggest quandary with the S. Tryon location is they frequently run short on food. 

My husband and kids went to the S. Tryon Qdoba around 8:30 p.m. on a Saturday night (restaurant closes at 9:00 p.m.). They were completely out of white rice, and at 8:45, at least 10 additional customers were in line behind us. No white rice available?! Seriously?! On a busy Saturday night? I could understand scaling back if service had been slow...but isn't rice a big part of the menu? 

Rather than get the standard white rice in our burritos, we all had to get seasoned rice. My husband and kids still found the food edible. I did not. I thought the rice had a terrible, artificial taste to it. For this reason, I am giving this particular location 2 stars, which I feel is more than generous given this was not the first time they were \"out\" of something in advance of closing time. Given this occurs a lot, I'm wondering if the staff stops preparing food in order to close the restaurant early, or to reduce leftovers and waste? Seems odd to me, either way. 

We have also eaten at Chipotle and have NEVER experienced a food shortage there. Our family tends to prefer Qdoba over Chipotle for taste, but I'm not sure I will personally return to this location."}
{"text":"Food is decent to good.  I have gone there three times for take out for my staff and the orders were completely screwed up three times and when I our someone else tried to correct the order they were incompetent or hostile."}
{"text":"Better than Chipotle and no E. Coli. I love the steak and the shredded beef burritos. You can get it however you want it. So that means I don't have to have that disgusting queso that you Clevelanders love so much forced upon me. Win-win in my book. This is closer to Mexican food than Taco Bell or any of the other \"Mexican\" restaurants in this town. 

Restaurant is clean and service is snappy."}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything spectacular either.  To be honest, I prefer the Chipotle restaurant next door."}
{"text":"2 words Taco Tuesday!  This isn't advertised that well and who could blame them when I walked in and ordered 7 different soft tacos with chips, salsa and guacamole for $13. Every Tuesday, all day long , Qdoba offers $1.39 tacos. You can get hard or soft sell and any kind of meat except steak.  I recommend the chicken.  Their salsas are always fresh and the guacamole is delicious. The staff was friendly and they are quick with your order.  If you want a quick, cheap and tasty take-out place this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I was very saddened to see this Qdoba ranked so low on Yelp, so I decided to try to boost its average.  

We frequent this particular Qdoba in the University area about once a week and have had nothing but fantastic experiences, quality service, and fabulous tasting food!  In fact, I've mentioned during lunch how we see the same people working week after week and how they've got it together.  I've been to many other Qdoba (and other similar burrito restaurants) and have yet to find a staff that is more consistent in their quality service and delivery of fresh, tasty food.  

Now, onto Qdoba's food.  I think I've tried practically every single item on the menu by now.  Their chicken choices definitely top my list over their steak (sometimes tough), beef (sometimes greasy), and pork (usually dry).  The chicken, in the words of Goldilocks, is \"just right.\"  Every time.  The regular chicken burrito (with extra hot salsa, please!) is always a winner.  However, when I'm in the mood for something with a little more pizzazz, I go with the pesto chicken burrito or formerly, the retired mole chicken burrito.   And when I'm in the mood for something naughty, I go with the queso chicken burrito.  The Naked Burritos (without the tortilla, for you low-carbers) are good...but I leave still feeling hungry.  

Since we go to Qdoba regularly, we've signed up for the Qdoba Card, earn points each time we visit, and have gotten a handful of free burritos over the past few years.  It's a great rewards program for something we already enjoy!"}
{"text":"I really don't enjoy giving places low star ratings.. but this experience was not the greatest. I've been here a few other times but it hasn't gotten better. My issues were with the store more than the food. It's just like any other qdoba. Great queso!! 

Anyway, I ordered the 3 cheese nachos with the protein that was supposed to be $7.50 and a regular drink that was $1.50. I got to the register and it was $10.50 and with tax I do t think it should've been that much. I didn't think it through and the lady didn't give me a receipt to see how she charged me. I could be doing my math wrong and if I am just regard this portion of the review! I will admit that it is 100% my fault for not going back and saying something or not saying something at the counter. Just as a warning though if you go make sure to say something (unlike what I did). 

As for the service, I felt as if I was rushed when there was no line behind me and the lady wasn't super nice. She could've been having a rough day so who knows!! I didn't look to see what the health score was but when you looked up there were super large globs of dust everywhere on the ceiling. Not the best thing to see when you are taking a big bite of food. The bathrooms weren't really too clean either.

I probably won't go back on my own but at least the food was good!"}
{"text":"Sanitary concern:  an employee wearing plastic gloves and handling food and typing on a mini IPad at the same time.  See:  grabbing a handful of lettuce and then using the same hand to swipe a keyboard on a tablet.  

Folks, the employees here don't know the menu.  If you try and order the Triple Threat burrito, they will encourage you to make your own burrito because they don't know what goes in it. The reason the girl had the IPad is because she had the menu open that lists the ingredients. WTF??

Hire some competent and trainable people, please. And for the love of God this is food service. Have some sanitation standards. I am calling the Board of Health in the morning."}
{"text":"Similar to Cafe Rio, Zaba's, Chipotle, etc.. Good quality food; I've tried their burritos, salads, and (personal fave) Mexican gumbo. They send out BOGO coupons once a month or so, and prices are reasonable. Only issue is the service- they've messed up my online order almost every single time, and have even messed up on my in store orders too."}
{"text":"The worst experience. First of all Bald tall Manger is super nice and friendly but staff he hires seems like they hate there job specially girls short blonde and tall blonde omg No smile on there face always rude and cranky. Always tight on giving meat like they are trained to charge extra for one spoon of meat with an attitude wow seriously very disappointing. The meat you charging extra already dried up by sitting over hours. I am sorry girls if you loose your job over this but if you cut your attitude and put a smile on your face and greet customers and be generous on giving customers extra meat with no extra charge you can stay. Don't forget you are in food business and learn some manners from your boss. 
Dear Boss you better train your staff soon and make this place friendly otherwise you will be closing down soon too like your next door midwood smokehouse lol 
Not just the girls all the boys too they are stingy and always try to short on meat just to charge extra. 
Only this location Sisky YMCA in front of publix is the worst one. 

other locations I went omg they were super nice greet as soon as you walk in doors with a big smile like you are welcomed and give you extra meat at no extra charge and always talk friendly with a smile and always say come back and see us again and makes you feel like go again but not this location. 

Well I will not be coming back to you guys Goodluck"}
{"text":"I am indifferent to the food here. The salsas are kinda' bland but you can tell that the meat is lean and not fatty. Whenever this is the only restaurant in sight, I always drive around for a bit to see if I have another choice before settling ."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been checking this place out for sometime now in Uber eats and yesterday we finally had it, we surprisingly weren't disappointed! Ordering in there was simple and easy, there was also a lot of add on for free which was perfect for us because we are slightly picky with what we do or don't want on our burritos. My boyfriend for the chicken QDoba burrito and then the brisket nachos. I got a brisket burrito with brown rice, guacamole, chile verde, and cheese. The brisket was nice and tender which made the whole burrito perfect. It was a great burrito, but I think next time I order from here I'll order light rice and extra meat because my last few bites of it was just a rice burrito yet it wasn't too bad to the point where I wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"Went here for midweek lunch. The nearby high school had gotten out early so the place was packed with screaming teenagers. We should have left but decided to hang in there. We were 11th in line...

The chicken burrito was just fair; the rice and beans were watery and soft. My wife had a quesadilla whose crust was burned.

This location has outside seating overlooking a large manmade pond with a fountain and ducks. There's an awning to protect you from the heat and summer sun; nice."}
{"text":"So happy I found this place. Way better than Chipotle. I usually get the burrito bowl and every component is seasoned well and the guac (which is included!) is amazing. Staff is nice and the service is great. I also love that the soda machine has vanilla coke!"}
{"text":"We stopped on the way to our hotel and it was a mistake, almost empty and it was by far the dirtiest one I've been to. The person making our food obviously didn't want to serve us and the manager was readjusting he's pants while bagging our order. I got the impression they didn't like serving whites"}
{"text":"I ate here about a month ago and found a piece of plastic in my burrito. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I used Qdoba for catering a wedding and I cannot say enough good things about them. The food was wonderful and customer service even better. They came and set up for a small fee (25, or I paid 35 since I was farther out) but made for a stress free day and servings were generous so we had left overs. Will definitely use them again when I have a large event!"}
{"text":"I've loved qdoba's food since I first discovered years ago in the Midwest. I frequently travel I85 between Atlanta and the Charlotte or Raleigh areas and this location is an \"easy off, easy on\" stop in the Gastonia area.

My personal favorite is the pork quesadilla, served up with shredded lettuce, hot sauce, sour cream and guacamole."}
{"text":"Very small portions on my burrito...and chipotle or moe's tastes better. No bueno

The cashier decided to cook peppers on the grill while 3 people waited by the register...for at least 3 minutes. This location needs a supervisor or someone focused toward customer service"}
{"text":"My friend took me here during school to try it out. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of food you get. He always gets the nachos and they give him way too many chips each time, which we appreciate. The burritos are packed, they look like cantaloupes when they are finished. Great food."}
{"text":"Usually love qdoba...never going back. I went there with my niece the staff was just flat out rude. (Their conversation was more important than the 8 people waiting in lines orders.... but anyways it wasn't just once I gave them the benefit of the doubt and by that I mean I understand it's not always easy finding competent employees at a cheaper eatery such as...but no I go there a second time and get the same service. Sad to see I've taken my business to habanero's worth the extra drive."}
{"text":"After a busy morning of moving I thought I would take in the Qdoba after having passed it numerous times in the past.

The set up is much the same as a Zaba's or a Chipolte as is the chow.  I ordered up a Queso Burrito with chicken and a side of chips w/ queso sauce.

I found the food in general to be a bit bland which I determined to be a result of the much touted three cheese queso sauce.  I flavored it up with some bottled hot sauce.

Not hating, not loving but just plain OK."}
{"text":"There is often this Chipotle vs Qdoba debate that arises, but honestly I love them both in different respects. With that being said, this is definitely my go-to place for nachos as I can get queso and as much as I want without paying extra. The options here are pretty much limitless, and that's one of my favorite things about this place! Did I mention that they have one of those nifty virtual soda machines?"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've gone out of my way to give them a try and both times they were out of plain white steamed rice. I don't want brown rice or the white rice with cilantro and oils in it. I just want steamed rice. This is a very simple and key ingredient that could go in just about every order yet they can't keep any on hand."}
{"text":"Craving quick Mexican...Qdoba can hit the spot.

It's a similar concept to Moe's or Chipotle, fresh ingredients and toppings over you choice meat with rice and beans!

One thing I really like bout Qdoba is the Craft 2 deal. It's smaller portion options of some of their most popular dishes.

I chose to go with the two tacos and three cheese nachos. The tacos were good, I had one with chicken and one with steak. You can add any toppings you like including sour cream and guacamole for no extra charge. The steak was a little tough but the chicken was very well seasoned.

The nachos were a bit disappointing, they were layered with a heavy cheese sauce and it left most of my chips soft and wet...not how I like my nachos! I wanted and missed the crunch! 

Overall, I like the Craft 2 concept, the staff here were all very nice and the tacos were really good. Was it better than some of the other local Mexican joints around town...no but for quick Mexican it hit the spot."}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent.  The only drawback is the parking. Otherwise, the staff are very friendly and helpful. The food is fabulous!"}
{"text":"I still got an upset stomach sometimes eating at this Qdoba. The person making my burrito was rude and didn't even warm up the wrap. Not sure how their employee training went."}
{"text":"Terrible food. The cheapest nastiest tortillas I've ever had. And how hard is it to roll a burrito that doesn't just fall apart? Hate."}
{"text":"Just moved from TX to Pittsburgh and I'd been craving some good Mexican food. I finished up some light shopping in the area and decided to give Qdoba a shot...big mistake! I'd never eaten at a Qdoba before this incident and most likely never will. I did not know it was cafeteria style food but decided to try them out anyway...hey you never know right? Unfamiliar with their menu I go with the craft two, quesadilla and nachos. The cheese quesadilla was ok but the nachos were luke warm at best! Who sells luke warm queso on nachos? I politely asked the manager if my food could be reheated and I was given was a whole lot of attitude! I was there by myself and the manager did a really good job of embarrassing me and making me feel un-welcome. She was very argumentative, rude, and combative. All I wanted was hot food, I swear. I'm an easy going person and I understand how it is working in guest service but I don't condone or tolerate being rude to others! It's not necessary. But what blows my mind is that SHE IS THE MANAGER!!! Really?  She kept saying I'm sorry I can't heat up your food. I said can I just please have hot queso. So she puts some cheese in a ramican and hands it to me. No, I aplologize let me make it right or anything. Instead she made it seem like it was my fault and how dare I expect to get my money's worth! I sat down and called a friend in NYC describing my experience. I didn't even want to eat anymore. She just humiliated me in front of others! I went up to her letting her know how I felt and she still wouldn't listen. She just kept talking over me and continuing to be rude to me. I had to call corporate. They listened and offered coupons to give them another shot but honestly I'm not ever going back to a Qdoba again because of this location! The Caucasian manager with the chubby face, long kookaid red hair with the nose ring ruined my experience! Thanks a lot! Word of advice customers don't expect to get cold food...they expect for it to be hot and if it's not the customer expects for you to be apologetic and to offer to make it right! No exceptions!!! There's no excuse for bad service ever!!! I wish I could rate it zero stars!! Don't eat here!! You've been warned!!"}
{"text":"Taco was good. I just had the beef with guac. They charged $1 for the guac! Margarita was frozen goodness. Typical chain but good. It is inside an old downtown building and has cool colors.  Very clean as well with attentive staff. They collected my trash!  The atmosphere was all business lunch but I had a relaxing time with my taco and drink.  Go for lunch, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Decent food, good service, but prices are kind of high.  Four kinds of salsa:  Pico de Gallo (very mild), green tomatillo (tasty), and two types of red sauce.  I think their salsas taste too much like pre-made, and not fresh, although the Pico de Gallo looked like it was made fresh - but it didn't have too much flavor, and was not \"hot\" at all.  I would rate their guacamole as being one of their best items, along with their shredded chicken, shredded beef, and shredded pork."}
{"text":"I eat here several times a week.  The food and service is fantastic.  The only downside is waiting in line for lunch, which can be quite long on some days with very little room.  No matter how busy, the staff is always friendly and the food is always high quality."}
{"text":"The food okay but it definitely lacked flavor, even the salsas that were supposed to be hot tasted like nothing. 
Plus: Guac is not extra charge. The Loaded Tortilla Soup was good."}
{"text":"I used to be a Q'Doba fan.  But it will probably be a long time before we return, at least to THIS location. 

A visit to the men's room before the meal tipped me off to a decline in the quality of this location. Toilet paper was stuck between the stall door and the stall wall to fill in a \"I see you\" gap.  The wall board was also buckled.  Finally, the paper towel dispenser produced little paper.

Food wasn't good either. Had the Poblano Pesto Naked Burrito. Mrs. had the Mango Salad.  The chicken in both was hardened and a turn-off. 

Sorry Q, you won't be seeing us for a long time."}
{"text":"Qdoba reminds me of Chipotle in that you can make your own burritos and bowls/plates. You can also get nachos since that queso dressing is available. The chips (that were not covered in cheese) were not very crispy. After eating half of the nachos, my stomach had a semi-uncomfortable feeling. The food tasted okay, but felt as though it was somewhat lacking in flavor. The guac was just smashed avocados (no tomatoes and onions).

Qdoba promises adding guac and queso to your entrees at no extra cost. This is true ONLY if you add said items on top of the entree and NOT on the side. I mistakenly believed that getting guac and salsa on the side (I wanted to dip the chips into guac, not guac on top of chips) would be at no extra cost. Unfortunately, the employee did not let me know that there would be additional cost for getting the guac (+$2) and salsa ($0.50) on the side. I wish that the employee had at least told me about this additional cost."}
{"text":"Every time we come to Vegas we come to this specific Qdoba. Friendly people, good food, enough said."}
{"text":"Similar to other locations, I'm not a fan of this place, but they do have good chicken nachos. The food is bit pricey when you compare it to Chipotle, and less fresh as well. I'd only recommend this location if you are craving mexican and there are no other choices. Service was good."}
{"text":"I worked here for a few years (like 7 years ago ) and saw how the food was prepared. This place fresh as can be and the food is amazing. Every time I eat there still it's good. Way better than Moes, Chipotle; and salsaritas"}
{"text":"I go to Qdoba all the time and have tried all different ones around the country. But I have to say, the Qdoba in Chandler is my absolute favorite. Not because of the food (even though the food is amazing), but because of STEPHANIE! My boyfriend and I go to this location about every week, and are honestly disappointed when we don't see Stephanie there. She basically memorized our entire order in a matter of weeks and always is so happy to greet us when we come in. The level of customer service is amazing and should not go unnoticed. Thank you Stephanie for always making our experience so great."}
{"text":"The Qdoba in maryland was always so quiet. I was quite surprised to see this one so busy! Anxious to try the quesadilla that I ordered!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but not always the warmest. 

Service varies by staff member, some are quick and just want to get you through the assembly line and others help you put your order together taking the time to ask you what you would like. 

Extras are confusing; what can I really get on my burrito or taco? And staff aren't always the most helpful in letting you know about your options.

We still enjoy coming here! But now we know how to order so we're satisfied."}
{"text":"Not bad --- they have great queso and chips. They seem to keep raising the prices ... a chicken burrito is up to $8! There are a few other tex-mex places I would hit up before I'd venture here again. Sign up for their club membership online and you'll get frequent email coupons for buy-one-get-one entrees."}
{"text":"Read on and you'll get a kick out of this review...

Love QDOBA and visit it in many cities around US. But will never come to this location again due to horrible customer service. Here it goes:

I order the burrito and the chips, get to my seat and come back to ask for some Salsa. This really \"smart \"girl at the register(Irene) says, I'll have to charge you $0.97 for that. I asked her, \"how come? I didn't get any salsa with my chips.\"  She goes, \"because you ordered the Chips, which was $2 and not Chips and Salsa, which is also $2, so I'll have to now charge you for the salsa.\"

Really??  I just smiled and paid the $1. It's amazing how stupid can one be. Both the girls working the shift seemed to have no interest in their job and seemed like were forcefully just passing time. Stay away from this location."}
{"text":"First time there. honestly the food was so good, made me question ever going back to Chipotle. however, the staff here is very rude and judgmental. you'd think an older staff would be nicer."}
{"text":"First off, it's hotter inside the building than it was outside. 

Second, the little short Hispanic woman was very rude and barely talked to us. When we ordered tequila lime chicken bowls, she didn't even put chicken in. Also, she then proceeded to make the other worker (who was very nice) stop helping the other customers to come finish what she started. When the nice girl finished she asked if there was any meat in the bowl and we weren't sure. So she asked the rude woman and she ignored her coworker. Then the rude one decided to try and help finish off our bowls and I asked if there was chicken since she decided to ignore her coworker. All in all I had to ask her four times if there was chicken and then there ended up not being any. And after all this she continued being rude to us and her coworker. 

Also the entire time this was all occurring the rude lady continually got in the other females way and the cook did as well but then would get frustrated at her because she was moving too slow because they were in her way. 

Terrible service. Never going to this location. Rather go to chipotle."}
{"text":"Good spot and yummy food! Only thing was that the service was super SLOW. Had 5 people ahead of me and was literally waiting for 20 minutes I was about to just say F it and leave but I wanted to try it out for the first time after my friend raved about it. So I finally get to the front and when I go order fajitas as my alternate meat choice the guy tells me that they ran out so I was waiting for him to cut up the peppers and he quickly cooked it and I feel like he really did his best and I hate to complain but by the time I got to my table to eat my food the bell peppers were so undercooked they tasted so raw that I had to take it out and just eat the bowl without it which was disappointing. I didn't want to complain because he tried his best but I feel like they should be better prepared next time sadly they had only 2 employees doing everything!!! Not good. Place is also ok kinda old looking"}
{"text":"A couple of months ago,  I would completely agree that this location of Qdoba was subpar, but I think they are hopefully listening and starting to turn things around.  I was satisfied with my most recent visit.  My favorite entree is the chicken quesadilla, and it was made well. The chicken tasted fresh and tender.  There was no skimping on ingredients,  in fact they almost put too much cheese on it, but I like a generous helping of cheese anyway.  The staff was courteous and friendly.  They happened to be out of brown rice, so my wife had to settle for white rice on her burrito, but overall we were satisfied. I hope the improvement continues and I can raise my opinion to 5 stars."}
{"text":"According to the menu, the ancho-chili bbq sauce is slightly sweet, but it's not, it's very sweet, cloyingly so.  It works however on the slow roasted pork burrito primarily because the pork itself doesn't have much flavor at all. 

Major additional complaints are that the rice they put in the burritos is too mushy and their chips have a pre-packaged taste and feel although I'm sure they're made fresh in house. 

All in all it's a mediocre experience for made to order Mexican food at a fairly reasonable price.  Wouldn't recommend it compared to other options around town, but I wouldn't avoid it if friends wanted to go..."}
{"text":"Tasty food...but avoid the anemic and overpriced taco salad that would be better priced at $1.99 rather than $6.99."}
{"text":"Swetha + Qdoba's Grilled Veggie Burrito = wheeeeeeeeeeeee!!!

Yummmy, yum, yum, and some more yum!

Oh yeah, don't forget to go in wearing sweats!"}
{"text":"Love this place, the food is great. Love the fact that guacamole is actually free. Fresh food all the time, no long waits like chipotle! 

Make sure to give the Chile con Queso a try!!!! It's amazing! (Mexican style nacho cheese)"}
{"text":"Qdoba is the same concept of chipotle but better quality food and flavors. They offer more options in food and sauces. Their portions are huge & always fresh. I usually go with co-workers go lunch and they have a 2 for $22 deal. Two entrees, two drinks & a bag of chips and queso dip. I get a burrito or bowl with the grilled steak and chicken. The staff is vey friendly and quick. If there is a line, it moves quickly. They also offer kids meals for around $5. The location is clean but parking can get crowded bc it's in a busy parking lot with a large gym and big Starbucks."}
{"text":"delicious when im feeling a late night mexican feast and when chipotle is closed.  it has a larger variety of meals to choose from and a rewards program whereas chipotle doesn't

I got the chicken burrito (which was pretty good): a little on the greaser side with the rice, the chicken is delicious and vain free (unlike chipotle), not a huge fan of the fajita or salsas (the salsas have no kick/spice to them-not like chipotle's salsa), i didn't get beans on it though.

the chips and queso were delicious and a bit on the spicy side.  

if i had to choose between chipotle and qdoba- i would pick qdoba's chicken and everything else would be from chipotle."}
{"text":"I ordered the Nachos, they were pretty good.  I like the queso cheese on the Nachos, and the chicken is good.  I also like the portions.  For me, the chips are a little to salty, but I don't eat a lot of salt in general anyways.  The service was pretty fast and mostly friendly.  Me and a friend ordered together and specifically asked for 2 drinks.  She gave us 1 cup and when we told her again we needed 2, she said \"I only charged you for 1\" in a somewhat snotty attitude.  WTF, I don't care, charge me and give me another cup.  Other than that everything else was fine."}
{"text":"I prefer Qdoba over some similar places such as Chipotle mostly because Qdoba has more selections to choose from and because I am a hige fan of the Queso cheese.  Other than that this place isn't anything too special.  The food is pretty good, the prices are 'ok', and the place is clean which is about all you can ask; however these types of places are a dime a dozen and I can find better quality foods at Carlito's Burritos or places like that.  One thing that I do love and would recommend to anyone is order the Chicken or steak quesadilla and order a side of chips and queso.  They give you way more queso than you need for the chips, so take the Chicken quesadilla and dip it in the queso cheese for an amazing taste.  Also, sign up for the Qdoba fan club and you will get a $6 meal deal coupon about once a month which is a nice little deal to have."}
{"text":"I feel like there's always this argument within my circle of friends about who makes the best burritos: Qdoba or Chipotle? To be honest, I've never had Qdoba before this point. Always a Chipotle fan so never found the reason to try the \"other\" burrito place. 

To judge for myself, I went to Qdoba and ordered their burrito with the exact fillings I would've ordered at Chipotle. Here's what I have to say about Qdoba. First off, their burrito is equally as fat as Chipotle's. Qdoba's chicken was a bit dry and the seasoning not as flavorful. The beans too soggy, making the whole burrito extremely soggy. The salsa was not crisp, but mushy. Overall, I thought the burrito was kind of bland due to the lacking of seasoning in the chicken. 

The final verdict: I did not finish my buritto. Qdoba disappointed me and I will be back at Chipotle tomorrow."}
{"text":"INCONVENIENCE! This is the first (AND LAST) time I've visited a Qdoba. Very simple. . .I went out of my way to go to this Qdoba to get a $50 gift card. I wanted to use my debit card (with my pin # that is connected to my checking account). I was told by the \"manager\" that they only accept cash for gift cards. But for food, I could use a debit (or credit card). I asked him if it was a franchise. Yes. I asked him who's policy that was. He said, \"It is Qdoba's policy.\" I asked him who his boss was (wondering if he is the franchise owner or not). He told me that the district manager in Henderson is his boss. 
Well, already having gone out of my way, I was NOT going to be inconvenienced by finding an ATM only to come back with the money - that they could have charged directly to my checking.
So, I called Qdoba Corporate. Apparently, Qdoba is a sister-company to Jack-in-the-Box. FANTASTIC! Jack-in-the-Box takes credit & debit cards, right? The receptionist at corporate explained to me that the \"Cash for Gift Cards\" policy can be enforced by a franchise owner, but is not necessarily mandatory. 
According to the \"manager,\" there has been problems with using credit/debit cards for purchasing gift cards. But if I were a real scammer, I could have bought $50 worth of food, paid for it with credit/debit card, complained about the food (so they re-make it and waste food). Or I could have disputed the charge later. . . .
I think I will take the high road and just NEVER step foot in another Qdoba. . . .In this town there are a TON of competitor Mexican restaurants who will gladly take my money.
THANK YOU, Qdoba, for teaching me a valuable lesson on economics & customer service! Good Job!"}
{"text":"This place has good management. Super clean restaurant and kitchen. Burrito was pretty darn good. Five stars for not charging extra for Guacamole. Will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places... My go too Mexican lunch spot!!   I prefer it over chipotle because they offer acquisition sauce option and I am a sucker for question!!   On a side not they now offer 3 flavors of quest... All 3 are good, but original is still my favorite!!   The craft 2 lunch menu is a good value... A smaller portions of 2 items for $6.49.  Make sure to try the Mexican Gumbo at some point... My second favorite item after the chicken quest buritto!!"}
{"text":"First time to this chain.....tacos were awesome loved that the gauc is free even if blan in flavor."}
{"text":"Qdoba is one step up from a drive-through, but it's definitely worth the couple extra dollars. Not too spendy, good food that doesn't make you sick, unique flavor. What more can you ask for in a \"make your own\" burrito bar. Plus, the drink machine they have is pretty awesome! So many different soda flavors, I'd go back just to get an unique soda. 

Obviously, not the greatest food in the world. But good enough to curve a good burrito craving."}
{"text":"When it comes to fast-casual burritos, I really prefer Chipolte, but given that Qdoba is much closer, I go there more often. I do really like their poblano chicken burrito with cilantro-lime rice.  When I have stopped into this location, it is not too crowded so service is generally pretty fast here and you have plenty of options for seating."}
{"text":"Very similar to the food offered at Chipotle, so if you like Chipotle, you may like this chain, too. I tried the shredded beef bowl (without any queso sauces) and it was good. I left pleasantly satisfied. Staff were friendly and a HUGE plus for me here, although probably not for everybody, is that it is a smoke-free environment, too...hip hip hooray!"}
{"text":"Tonight, an employee at your Gastonia location verbally harassed a mother for breastfeeding her child. 

The employee approached the mother, who had just finished breastfeeding, and told her she was \"making sure you weren't showing too much skin\". After further conversation, the employee stated that had the mother still been breastfeeding and deemed to be showing too much skin, she would have been asked to cover up or leave. And if she didn't comply, the authorities would be called. The employee stood by this declaration even after being informed that a mother has the LEGAL RIGHT to breastfeed anywhere she is legally allowed to be, and that breastfeeding mothers are legally exempt from NC indecent exposure laws. Furthermore, the employee called the store manager, and the manager upheld this absurd and ILLEGAL ruling. 

Excuse me, Qdoba. You have no right, legal, moral, or otherwise, to judge if the manner in which a woman feeds her child is appropriate. Do you make a habit of harassing the female customer whose skirt is cut up to there? The male customer who se shirt shows a little too much chest hair? You want to dictate what customers can and can't show in your store, post a dress code. EXCEPT, OH WAIT, BREASTFEEDING MOTHERS WOULD STILL BE EXEMPT. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TELL A BREASTFEEDING MOTHER TO COVER UP WHEN SHE IS FEEDING HER CHILD. IT'S ILLEGAL. AND ALSO JUST PLAIN SHITTY. 

The woman in question was told that it is Qdoba's policy to address every complaint. Personally, I think a better policy would be to respect every woman, and also perhaps follow the law, because, you know, it's the law. 

Let me repeat, one more time, because your employee and her manager didn't seem to get it, so apparently it needs to be said multiple times: IT'S ILLEGAL TO TELL A BREASTFEEDING MOTHER TO COVER UP. It also creates a culture of shame and fear around what should be the most natural, normal, and healthful of acts. 

Do what is right, Qdoba. Rectify this situation, immediately. Don't break the law, don't dictate the appropriate way for a woman to feed her child, don't be the reason a mother felt shamed for doing what is best for her baby. Make it right."}
{"text":"Seriously don't go here later on at night. We went  around 7 and everything tasted old and not fresh. The rice was hard and the ground meat tasted old. The portions were small and not worth the money. Go to anywhere but here. Sad."}
{"text":"At 3am, Chipotle is closed. Qdoba is open. The end.
Wowzer the line is brutal on barnights, but worth if it you need it.
Watching the staff get crazy angry at drunkards is a hoot as well, unless you ARE one of the drunkards.... it happens."}
{"text":"Truly terrible food, awful quality and full of deadly sodium!

{"text":"We've gone here for years and the past few have been cringeworthy. The service is abysmal and the employees seem quite incompetent. They normally mess up the order or get easily confused. They mislabel the burritos. This used to be our go to place for a quick dinner and now we avoid it unless we have a craving."}
{"text":"I had forgotten about Qdoba, as it rarely comes to mind when thinking about \"fast food\" mexican.

This location is a pretty decent size & clean. Employees were nice & sociable. 

We ordered 3 seasoned beef tacos, a grilled chicken burrito, along with fresh guacamole & queso. Toppings were fresh & not mushy. Chicken & ground beef was
cooked perfectly & seasoned well. 

Chips were seasoned with lime & warm & crisp! The queso was good & the guacamole even better. 

*edited: Maybe too much TMI, but 4 hours later, the food is sitting in my stomach like a rock. :("}
{"text":"The ONLY reason I come back is the food. The service,  however, is not the greatest.  I barely get a smile or hello most of the time. However,  most importantly, they NEVER look at the special instructions on carryout  slip.. I never get exactly what I want unless I go in myself."}
{"text":"As Greg F said, this is still the worst Qdoba in Charlotte. Portions are tiny. We ordered nachos with the chips on the side. I could practically see the bottom of plate with how little cheese was in the bowl. All 4 of us felt like we got ripped off and were still hungry after, but what can you do. Go to the arboretum instead where you actually get your money's worth."}
{"text":"My mother loves Qdoba.  And boy do I mean LOVES!  She works around the corner from the University Circle location and goes for lunch at least once a week.  Tuesdays to be exact, because it is triple points Tuesday.  Now, if you're a regular Qdoba eater you may know they offer a rewards system that will earn you points and ultimately free food if you're a frequent diner.  My mom gets so much free food from this place, it is definitely worth joining the free club.

I've been to Qdoba more in the past month than in my entire life.  I must say, I like the selection and the friendliness of the employees.  I know there are WAY more Chipotles out there but Qdoba boasts a variety that Chipotle just can't match.  I love the chips at Qdoba too.  The UH location stuffs that bag FULL and well, I can't say the same for Chipotle and the 1/3rd full bag of chips.

Qdoba offers a \"pick two\" menu where you can choose a smaller version of 2 items for approx $6.50.  I like this because again, I like variety, and I can have 2 things that aren't huge and I get more bang for my buck.  Generally I can take one item home for a snack or lunch the next day.  

The Gumbo is delish!  The naked salad is yummy.  There are about 6 salsas to try and Qdoba does offer seasonal options.  This year they had a yummy mango salsa.

If you're a Chipotle junkie, or just like your Mex. food, try Qdoba the next time you pass it.  I think you'll be surprised at the options and the goodness of the food!"}
{"text":"Ah, my guilty pleasure 3-cheese chicken nachos. I have been (somewhat) secretly loving you for over ten years.  I will wait in ridiculously long lines to be with you.  As with other University Circle restaurants you are crazy busy and slow during lunch (12-1) so I visit you on off times when I can."}
{"text":"Adequate.  Don't be silly,  neither Mexican or healhy."}
{"text":"Well it's better than most of the fast mexican places I have been to but its nothing special.  My veggie burrito was huge and came with guacomole (ps. this is big deal considering most places charge up to $2 extra) but everything just tasted blah not very exciting. The black beans weren't cooked through.  A plus though the place was clean and service was friendly."}
{"text":"One star is giving them too much! So my family loves this place, me, not so much. Today I ordered a bowel, my first,  and received what the picture shows. I asked for sour cream on side got home,  NO sour cream. What amazed me is that there was nothing in the bowl. I asked for two scoops of the rice and like I said, while good, no way worth 8.00
It was messy, leaking something down the side, no salsa just so sad. Then, and this ALWAYS seems to be an issue, i showed them my membership number. She looked at it and said ok and handed the phone back.... We have been to this store 6 times since March 1 and have had our order credited twice. 
How hard is it to put in a number?
I think I've reviewed this location before  because I thought I had commented on the horrible attitudes there and the fact they dont speak to each other in English when in our company which is kind of rude. Now the burrito we got that was 9.00 and was huge and full and correct. Sigh..."}
{"text":"Got three tacos to go...they were disgusting. Ice cold meat, taco shells like rubber, and I walked in as they were being made!!  Not like they sat around...can't imagine how much worse they could have been. I'll NEVER go here again.  Bull River Tacos in Squirrel Hill has my vote!"}
{"text":"For a long time, I avoided Qdoba. Really! I always had this idea that the food here was awful, greasy, and just all around bad for me. Well, I was mostly right, but it turns out that Qdoba is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be! In fact, I could easily see it becoming a fantastic occasional treat in my life.

I stopped in and ordered a quesadilla to go and couldn't have been happier. The pulled pork was delicious and I was able to get extra salsa, guacamole and sour cream in little cups on the side, meaning that my main entree wasn't completely slathered in distracting toppings. And I was SO impressed with the staff and assembly line they had going. Despite coming in to find a long dinner line, I was in and out within minutes. Very nice!

I didn't stay to eat here because the layout in the dining area seemed pretty cramped, although I noticed as I was getting ready to leave that there was an upstairs. Any place in Oakland is bound to have space issues sometimes just because of the student lunch/dinner rush. But the layout here did nothing to help the matter; while the staff were able to keep the line moving, there was almost no room to actually accommodate the long line that began forming and snaking through the tiny building. 

Still, the food was pretty excellent, even if I had to go elsewhere to get some elbow room while I devoured it. For the record, comparing Qdoba and Chipotle seems pretty apples and oranges given that their menus are only a little similar. So sure, the food is better at Chipotle, but the options aren't NEARLY as diverse. Apples and oranges. A better comparison is Qdoba and Taco Bell, and in that sense Qdoba is truly superior. I mean really, who thinks it's even a contest?

Unfortunately there were no reasonably healthy options here, so I doubt I'm going to be able to become a regular. Once I work off the quesadilla in about a month I'd love to eventually come back and see if the tacos compare - although I admit, when it comes to burritos I do think I'll forever be a Chipotle fan."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time about 2 weeks ago. 

My experience:
I walked in and it looked pretty standard for the type of establishment that it was. I looked at the menu for a little while and decided on a taco salad and two tacos. I wasn't sure if the taco salad was build-able or it had preselected ingredients like it showed on the menu. It was buildable kind of like chipotle where you go down the line and decide what you want (black beans or pinto beans kinda ish). While I was picking out what I wanted I was asking questions on what was what. The man preparing my food seemed very annoyed with me even after I explained it was my first time there. Not all the staff were unpleasant there was another man there he seemed actually interested in helping me get my order ready. 
Conclusion:
Finally after having my food ready and prepared the way I wanted it to be I was pleased with my order. The Taco salad was fabulous I like the crunchy bowel it came with. The Tacos were delicious as well (I picked out the pre-selected choices on the menu). Now comparing with Chipotle They seemed to have more options such as sauces/dressings and there guacamole was better. I would come back, but I am disappointed in the service."}
{"text":"Ordered food online at 5:40. Email said it would be ready at 6:00. Arrived at 6:05 and waited 30 min for my food. I asked twice how much longer the wait would be since my dog was in the car. Both times I got blank stares or rude answers. Got home and was missing an entire burrito and my queso was spilled all over the chips as if it were thrown into the bag."}
{"text":"Door was locked even though the restaurant was supposedly open and there were still people inside.  Would rate zero stars if possible, since one star implies that I at least experienced the food."}
{"text":"Methinks not is right. This place continues to disappoint. The food is overpriced and I don't know why I came back here, especially since the last time I swore this place off forever. Silly me. I ordered the steak salad, which comes with lettuce, steak, and then you get to add all of your toppings like cheese, salsa, beans etc. They asked if I wanted any dressing for my salad, I said I would take the chipotle ranch. The lady gives me a smalll 2 oz cup of dressing for a large salad. I asked for another dressing AFTER I paid, so they wouldn't attempt to charge me. Well the joke's on me, that ranch was DISGUSTING. It was probably some Sysco brand goop, mixed with ass, it was horrible!  I had already poured most of it onto my salad, so I couldn't eat anything more. I debated whether or not to ask for a refund, but figured I would just chalk it up as a loss and never return. One of the only things I did like about this place is they have the Freestyle Coke machine, but everyone has that now and even still if they were the only restaurant in the world that had that machine, I wouldn't step foot in this place again. I mean it this time."}
{"text":"Always very clean, the food is fresh, and the staff is super friendly! Their Guac is the best!!"}
{"text":"Let's face it there are a lot of Tex-Mex Fast grill places these days. There are 2 things that set this location apart from the competition... really amazing cheese or \"queso\" sauce and the Coca-Cola freestyle drink machine"}
{"text":"Q-doba is probably not a place you'd make a special trip across town to visit.  But if you're shopping in Matthews, give it a shot. Located in the Sycamore Commons Shopping Center, this place is between Jimmy Johns and Stool Pigeons.

I always get the taco salad.  They fill up a taco shell bowl with ROMAINE lettuce (not that pale substitute...Iceberg, is it?), shower it with spicy ranch, and your choice of fresh salsas.  Its a definitely a meal when you add the toppings.  

The service is normally good.  The young, fresh faces serving you haven't been stripped of all hope in humanity (yet).  The place gets packed at random times.  But its pretty certain that after church on Sundays (hey, this is Bible Belt), they will be a bit rushed.  A little pricy, but definitely worth a few $$$ more than Toxic Bell."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm a Chipotle girl.  No need to try Qdoba in my mind.  But I'm glad I did.  I love that they have several choices including soup and salad variations.  Also, they have a vegetable burrito that is not just beans and guac but also squash and other real vegetables.  Servings are similarly huge so you have to watch your consumption, but nothing is too expensive and four-for-four experiences were very good."}
{"text":"We ordered the taco bar catered for 20 by phone. On the day and time it was supposed to be ready we found out they FORGOT to make our meal!  No accommodation, no apology...but they did send a survey by email!  Nice job Qdoba."}
{"text":"Qdoba is a hidden gem for those of you that have been hiding under a rock or never heard of it. The concept of Qdoba is similar to Chipotle and Zaba (healthy Mexican food). They have quesadillas, burritos, taco salads, tacos, and some of the best nachos with toppings that you can buy. The queso dip is incredible as well. You are able to pick your meat of choice as well as the toppings to go along with it. Very simple. The naked burrito is by far one of my favorite things on the menu when I want to eat healthy. You order what you want and they put it in a bowl for you. The staff are always very friendly and the place is always extremely clean. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Ok, so this was my second time ever going to a Qdoba and I can say for certain it will be my last. The first time I ever tried Qdoba, I remember the food being sub par and thinking to myself, why didn't I just go to Chipotle?! Several people I know rave about this place and I'm starting to think the only thing keeping this chain alive is the queso. I tried the featured mango salad which I actually ended up throwing away after eating the mango chunks off the top. The iceberg lettuce was gross, I'm talking wilted with brown slimy pieces mixed in. The guacamole was brown/black almost to the point that I didn't order it in the first place but I have a slight love affair with anything avocado so it's hard to say no. All in all, I will not return and when I get a burrito craving, I'll head to Chipotle."}
{"text":"So queso here does cost extra! False advertising! Just not a fan of this place. That's probably why no one is ever there. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Went to Qdoba for the first time and it was just A-ok.  Had the naked bowl with chicken.  Serving size was ok.  They charge extra for the fajita veggies, where chipotle doesnt.  I think the only thing they have going for them is that they offer queso and do some other combinations that are a little different that Chipotle.  Next time I'll probably try the tacos, but maybe next time I'll just got back to Chipotle :)"}
{"text":"I like their food and the rewards program, but if I hear them say, \"that'll cost a little extra\" one more time, I'll puke."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. It was recommended to us by a friend and I'm so glad I stopped by this place. It has the same chipotle concept, but more options to put into your food. My boyfriend and I got the burrito and it super filling. We absolutely loved it. The Queso sauce is the best!!"}
{"text":"I could eat here most everyday if my waist line wouldn't mind. Since I can't do that, I manage to sneak in a couple times a month. The ground beef nachos are to-die-for!!! Their queso is the bomb. And their chips are excellent and very fresh. If you love fresh salsa and friendly service, this is the place to go in the University area."}
{"text":"The food at Qdoba is obviously amazing but I had a terrible employee making my tacos one day. I accidentally asked for guacamole twice and she gave me such attitude saying \"yeah I heard you the first time,\" I was shocked she was so rude and I told her I wish I had better customer service and she replied with \"I wish we had better customers\" 
When I got to the register to pay I told the cashier how rude the employee was and he informed me she was the manager. 
I refuse to go to the Qdoba location on state street now."}
{"text":"WAY BETTER THAN CHIPOTLE!!! There quick and the food is amazing the meat is always cooked just rite. My husband comes here once a weekend to pick up our favorites burrito bowl and carne asada burrito. Tastes fresh and the man I see work there always works so hard!"}
{"text":"I ordered a burrito from Uber Eats and when I got it rather than being in burrito form it was a square. A square where they layered the meat on one end and the rest of the ingredients on the other. I took a bite of my square burrito on one end and it was meat and the other it was rice. Seriously? I mean you make burritos everyday. I threw it away because it was gross and I just wanted puke."}
{"text":"So when I walked in the girl had an attitude that was working.. however after I gave her one back she did snap out of it. Decided on a pork burrito after sampling the meat. I had to ask for a little more of everything.. they must get commission based on the smaller portion sizes they give. Got a drink and the burrito for 11.46 with tax. Food was okay, I would suggest going to chipotle or next door to Wingstop. 2 good things were all of the sides are included in the price and the place is empty so you don't have to wait in line . . Now I know why ."}
{"text":"If you are in a lunch or dinner rush and find yourself in Uptown, I would recommend swinging by Qdoba - they have a fairly good variety of your typical burrito/taco selections.  I upgraded my chicken burrito to a combo with nachos and mild salsa - they honestly barely give you enough salsa to finish the nachos....so that was about the biggest complaint I had.  The service was pretty decent, very fast - a pretty decent 'fast food' option in uptown in you find yourself in a pinch for time."}
{"text":"Tasty entrees including vegetarian selections.  Limited menu with patrons' choices for ingredients.  Pictures on wall menu would be helpful"}
{"text":"My sisters & I decided to pick up food on a Friday night. We ordered several burritos & a quesadilla. My sister asked for a side of salsa twice & she was  just ignored. Finally she is given a half full container of salsa with an attitude, mind you we paid an additional $1 for a side of salsa!  The rice was hard & the chips were super salty. 

I don't like to give negative reviews, but the whole experience was upsetting!"}
{"text":"Great service from Zach today. He went above and beyond to be courteous, funny, and came to clear our table. Thanks for the hospitality!  I went with my usual chicken burrito and jazzed it up with queso- living on the edge. I was pleasantly surprised that my drink was free with my reward card. Overall, very enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"Nothing much to say about Qdoba except reasonable price food, nothing WoW about the food except it ok, decent portion, and if looking for something quick on the go. It decent option. It located right next to my normal gym 24hours so if starving after workout one of my go spots. I normally get the bowl because less of mess then burrito style. Maybe all the same but feel like getting more food in the bowl. Not much of fan comes to brown rice but they do have that option. I usually get the chicken feel cooking on point sometimes dried out since cut small diced and keep warm. Really when you put the salsa, beans, and guacamole all good. The guacamole fan of! It taste fresh and made daily. Overall not authentic Mexican but in the end food that would come back for quick, simple, filling, and hits the spot.

The service never had bad one. The staff has always been friendly and  great experience. I like the soda fountain. It one of self service but catch is get choose from six different coca cola flavors and lot more choices. The only downfall is since only one machine depending on the business might have to wait. The interior is pleasant, clean, and relaxing vibe."}
{"text":"Employees are incredibly friendly.  Food is fresh and delicious!  I could eat this every day"}
{"text":"Q-GOAT-BA! Thats what i call it because its the GOAT, okay maybe not GOAT but for me its my number one go to mexican spot for a quick fresh and frugal meal! For ME, its way better than chipotle, they have queso, and always have new additions to the menu. Tacos, salad, burritos, burrito bowls, its all great! Most of all they have a rewards program! for every meal you earn points toward FREE food. TAKE THAT CHIPOTLE! This particular location is my favorite, its always clean and the staff is friendly and polite. Always helpful, let you taste queso, the chips are always fresh. I love the qdoba franchise and everything that comes with it!!"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I love this place! The staff is very generous and the girl that works nights is always extra friendly!"}
{"text":"This is a great location (and one of the only ones I've been able to find in Vegas). The staff is always friendly and it's never been super busy when I've visited--been about 10 times total, some lunch and some dinner. I love that you get free queso--something no other burrito place seems to want to do. Also, they don't advertise it but they have free wifi. So if you work from home like me and you're tired of having to go to a coffee shop every time you want to co-work, you can do a working lunch/dinner here. It's nice and quiet (and delicious).

TIP- If you're like me and get things like the Double Decker Taco or Cheesy Gordita Crunch from Taco Bell because they have that softness with a crunch, next time you get a burrito from Qdoba ask them to add tortilla strips. It's the perfect add-on for crunchaholics like us ;)"}
{"text":"Found the server's long black hair halfway through my salad. I didn't go back and demand a refund or to get something new. I'm sure it was an accident but I will absolutely never eat there again."}
{"text":"All I can say is waaayyyy better than chipotle. Not just the food, but the customer service was great. I had never been here before and she helped me so much with my selections. And I got guac for free!!! I didn't have to pay a whole bunch extra. Great place."}
{"text":"QDOBA is the less satisfying version of Chipolte, and if I were to rate QDOBA by itself I'd give it 2 stars. I have been really happy with this specific location on multiple occasions. The staff are all really nice and or remains pretty clean and organized, even when it's busy. You can expect this place to be busy during lunchtime Monday through Friday."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to burrito place but I haven't been for years because I work  close to a chipotle. 
I went at 3pm and the food did not look fresh. It was left uncovered even though there were no other customers. The customer service was ok. The burrito was huge and guacamole is included in the cost, so that's nice. 
Overall there is nothing about this place that would make me drive out of my way to go to."}
{"text":"Qdoba is ok. Same idea as Chipotle Grill, but, in my opinion, the food just doesn't taste as good. The burritos don't have that magic ingredient that makes me want to return. And I did not dig the decorating scheme - especially the concrete floors and metal tables. It feels cold and dark, even in the summer."}
{"text":"A Qdoba is a Qdoba is a Qdoba. This is no exception. The food/ ingredients are consistent. I visit this location semi frequently and have always been pleased.

This location is in a convenient place but the parking lot is less than desirable. One way street in one way street out the back. It's very clean inside and the staff is friendly. I usually show up later at night and I am always in and out.

I like this location, and it is consistent for what it is."}
{"text":"This place was awesome when I first came to college and Chipotle wasn't around.  I still prefer it over Chipotle because they have nachos.  

There was a short period when the state street location offered breakfast burritos on the weekend but that stopped after a few months which was a shame.  The breakfast burritos were awesome.  It was like sonic x2.  

I'd go there every weekend and pick one up and eat half of it in the morning then pass out.  Wake up later in the day and finish it off.  I'd easily give it 5 stars if they brought back the breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"Great 1st experience here. My friend treated me to lunch & has been talking to me for weeks about trying this chain. Slow when we came in, we were treated wonderfully. I explained I was a first timer. The gal behind the counter gave me a sample of each of the queso sauces & a chip for each. Went with the smothered burrito with shredded beef. Original queso sauce on top & inside the burrito. Love that the guacamole is free! Most places charge extra from my experience. Got an extra side of chips & more queso. I love queso & this meal was a home run for me. The manager came over & was very friendly. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Can get busy at lunch time, but the staff always gets me through quickly.  The veggie burrito with corn salsa is to die for.  I appreciate that they warn you that extra guacamole will cost more."}
{"text":"I really had no clue what type of concept Qdoba was because I had never heard of it at all, this location is right by our house and we gave it try since our first time but it will be our last..

This place is barely OK, just in the same lines as Chipotle :/

My mom ordered a ground beef taco and a beef and bean burrito as was not thrilled at all. Neither was I, how can you mess up at plain basic soft taco? Their meat doesn't taste good, it's not seasoned and didn't taste fresh. I only got a soft taco with meat and cheese and it was like $3.00+!

Rice and beans are just so so, the best things were their chips and queso dip, that was the only redemption in this meal. If you like Chipotle than you will like this place.

Staff was friendly and accommodating to us since it was our first time! I hope the food quality improve :/"}
{"text":"I have to spend many Sundays hanging around the ASU campus and there never seems to be much to eat before 12pm...or after.  Everything but Burger King and Qdoba are closed in the Memorial Union.  I really appreciate Qdoba as a more refreshing option than Burger King when desperate.  The food is just mediocre however.  The quesadilla is probably the best of the options.  Hard to really really mess up cheese in tortilla.  While it is packed full of melted cheese and meat, it is quite salty - both meat and cheese.  The salsas could be more flavorful as well.  I do like that they do not charge you extra for guacamole like most places do."}
{"text":"It sort of reminds me of a subway version of mexican food but that said : it is no Taco Bell. I've always been a huge fan of their grilled veggie burritos , bean burritos and taco salads. The ingredients are amazing and I know some people complained about the beans but gosh - they're the best part! I love that hot salsa-- pour it on!"}
{"text":"Go to this location every few months. This evening we went for dinner. The place is spotless.  The employees are so friendly and welcoming. Food is delicious and a great price. Weight watchers can make a bowl and only count few points. Good job! The only negative for me was the air conditioning emitted a high pitched sound that my sensitive ears could hear so we took our meals to go."}
{"text":"Tonight Wednesday night was a great experience, it looks like there's new faces working there which was I was impressed with great customer service overall. They were attentive, fast and nice especially a kid named Isaac he was so sweet and nice. The burritos are excellent I love this place!"}
{"text":"What I like about this place is the agility of the staff on getting the food ready.
The food was good but I was not impressed and the menu is a little concise. 
It is a great place to go if you don't have much time to sit down and wait for your food. 
They are also gluten free so you have food restrictions you can go without being afraid of getting sick. 
The manager was really nice and checked on us many times during our meal."}
{"text":"I love that we have Qdoba back in CU.  The location on Green St was fine, but their quality really went south towards the end.  The location in the union is a welcome return!

I am especially pleased they now offer tacos at this location, the menu was limited to start.  The diablo Queso is excellent!"}
{"text":"Happy Valentine's Day! It's also buy one get one entree Qdoba day yay! 

I love the taco shells here. It's all I ever order. You can add rice, beans, meat, and various toppings to your order. The jalapeños are also extra tasty for some reason. 

I recently discovered the rewards app. It's good to rack up points it you visit every so often."}
{"text":"Decided to try something new.

Service was excellent, people were very friendly.

Food was good, had a pork burrito.

Overall was a good cheap bite. Nothing high end o grand but sometimes a good cheap bite is just right."}
{"text":"Best healthy food option in the area - my go to is the 8.99 burrito bowl with a tortilla on the side. I load it up with extra beans, all tops of salsa and the free guacamole. They let you load up your meals so you get a ton of value, the only thing that costs extra is when you ask for extra meat, other than that - ask for extra everything!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I'm generally a fan of Qdoba, mostly because of their queso and the taco salads (I love the chip-bowl for the taco salads!). The staff were a little slow in getting to me, and the lady who was working the registers decided to spend several minutes chatting with the guys cooking in back while I was standing at the register waiting to pay which was annoying. But this place has one of those cool touch-screen Coke soda dispensers where you can mix like 30 different flavors in your drink! I haven't seen one of those machines in forever!"}
{"text":"Qdoba is in a convenient location and the service is good. I got the veggie burrito and once they wrapped it and gave it to me, man was it heavy! The chips and salsa were good and salty. In a pinch, I'd go back. I still prefer Chipotle (get with the program Qdoba on non-hormone injected meats)."}
{"text":"I usually pass over this restaurant in favor of the Qdoba on Sixth. 

Nothing special and also the restaurant is very narrow and you have to squeeze pass people entering the restaurant to get to the fountain drink machine.  This Qdoba is poorly laid out and I never feel completely comfortable eating here. 

I often wonder if because of my size I get served less food. My tacos are always filled with the tiniest bit of filling at this Qdoba. Yes I may be a small person but I am paying the same price as the next person. So it does annoy me when I'm served less and this happens all the time here. 

I cannot get full eating even 3 tacos at this Qdoba, it's not a good value for my money."}
{"text":"Blech. The saltiest Mexican style food I've ever had - worse than places like Baja Fresh. I had the fajita burrito with chicken. If you like salty, give it a try; I won't be repeating it."}
{"text":"Miserably hot -83 degrees inside. I told the man at the register (bearded guy) that I wanted to eat but would just take a drink because it was too hot and humid to eat here - his response was \"fine don't eat here - its always this hot in the summer - come back in the fall\" Real classy"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Qdoba on several occasions, usually when friends insist or for convenience.  I have never had anything there that blew me away.  Last night I had the Taco Salad and added the 3 Cheese sauce, guacamole and corn salsa.  It was good.  It wasn't anything special.  I don't seek this restaurant out but will not go out of my way to avoid it.  It is just, well, adequate.  The staff were nice and the restaurant clean.  No real complaints."}
{"text":"I eat here at least 3 times a week.  The cooks are so down to Earth , and also make me smile when I come in. 

I normally get two tacos, steak or ground sirlion. I like that this place is so close to my job and that the cooks are nice.

One con- None of the cooks ever mentioned a  rewards card to me. I would think that since I eat there so much some one would have told me.  I  do have a rewards card now. But with the amount  of money I spend in here I could have had 5 free meals lol. No harm no foul."}
{"text":"When they change the girls that work there I will go again. I don't  know what the attitude problems are about. First time I went I was like okay whatever. Second time two weeks later I got the same thing. I did contact corporate and hopefully they talked to them. I don't spend  my money on luke warm food to get greeted by an attitude of someone that hates their job. You don't like it, then quit."}
{"text":"Delicious and I think they give you a lot of bang for your buck! The concept of this place is like chipotle but I feel like they give you a bit more food. I like that you can choose between a burrito, bowl or nachos and you can build up upon it.

After my workout before a softball game, I was STARVINGGGG so I wanted something clean but filling and we happened to drive by and it only made sense since everything else was greasy fried food. I got the bowl with white rice, tequila lime chicken, all the veggies, pinto beans and no sauce and it totally hit the spot for $7.80. Not a bad price at all and they loaded up my bowl with food.

I feel like if you're on a budget, eating here would be a good choice as the bowls and burritos are good for 2 meals or 2 people. Definitely fresh food, the chicken was nice and juicy and the veggies were nice and crisp. 

Staff were very kind and got the food out quickly and efficiently. All in all, I will be coming back to this restaurant when I'm on this side of town!"}
{"text":"I have not visited a Qdoba since 2009 when I left Seattle. When I moved to Charlotte and found out there was one here I was amped. My memories of this place did not disappoint. It was everything I remembered.

The chicken was juicy and seasoned, fork tender. The Mexican gumbo was spot on. The guacamole was to die for. I am happy to be reunited with one of my favorite places to eat. Everything was fresh and the service was great."}
{"text":"Convenientlu located next to Settlers Ridge cinema.  Good, fresh-made to order Mexican food. My friend and I both had a fajita which was made just right! Before ordering we were given samples of the different Meats since we could not decide what we wanted. The gentlemen helping us was friendly and enthusiastic about the restaurant and its food. My friend is a very finicky eater and she kept saying this is so good this is so good. Qdoba was a winner for her and me. It gets a little busy near six seven o'clock because of the movies so give yourself a little extra time. For $10 each we had a wonderful meal and soda"}
{"text":"Food good. In both cases where I have been there there were few other customers but service was painfully slow. Today I almost left. Two Timer pork taco was tasty!"}
{"text":"Tuesday is Taco special day. The price is 1.29 dollar per taco, which is really inexpensive. But the taco is really small and the worst of all, it is cold. 
Which I didn't expect is that even I bought tacos with super low prices they still offer free drink if you can show a valid student ID card. 
But I have to mention that the tacos on Atwood street are way more better. I'd rather get cash from the nearest ATM and walk there."}
{"text":"On a Friday night, there were only a few of us looking for a quick, made-to-order dinner.  The staff were friendly and efficient.  The restaurant was clean.  

I do like that you can do a sort of pick 2 here.  My choice of a plain cheese quesadilla and a salad were nothing exciting, but were prepared well and as requested.  Coke Freestyle machine - yay!"}
{"text":"Breastfeeding is a RIGHT!!! Your company needs to conduct their business the right way and according to the law!! Since the manager stated that it is the COMPANYS policy to discriminate against breastfeding women then I will no longer go to any of the establishments."}
{"text":"The first time I had QDoba was years ago in Chicago and am shocked this is the only location in Phoenix! There's something different in a good way about this chains food. Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of this shop. The pans the food was being served had crusty's all around the rim. The staff seemed to forget they were at work since they spent more time in the back chatting and on their phones than out front organizing/cleaning which was desperately needed. Still same great food, would only come back to this location because it is the ONLY one in the state! Why?? There should be more!"}
{"text":"Always come here for the burrito bowl. Even there's always a line. Grilled chicken is the best here. It is very quick but you need to know exactly what you want, otherwise by the time you are thinking, even it is just two seconds, they will take it as no I don't want anything. So be aware of that."}
{"text":"I would have agreed with some of the older reviews, but I went yesterday for the first time and it was better.  There was a different manager working than the younger girl who used to be there.  The younger one was not friendly and was always quick to point out what they can't do for you.  One time she tried charging me for extra guac because the guy working put it on my burrito without asking.  Thankfully, they no longer charge for guac and sour cream, but they did raise the prices slightly to make up for it.  The food is decent but they don't have as many toppings to choose from as Moe's does.  I'd go back since the food is decent and the service has improved."}
{"text":"There's fast food and there is sloppy food.

The Qdoba is sloppy. How sloppy you ask?

So sloppy that the black bean that fell onto the counter is tossed back onto your nachos. So sloppy they they give you a ton of sour cream and barely any queso. So sloppy that your quesadilla will be soggy and drippy and contain no melted cheese. 

This is why everyone loves Chipotle across the street."}
{"text":"Fairly tasty for fast food type mexican food. 

Their chicken and steak soft tacos were pretty good!"}
{"text":"Food is great but the staff needs to be as good as the food and speak English!
 So this the  only place where their meat is well done, it  seems the other joints that are similar to this place,  the steak is not as well done. So if you like well done meat it's good. Beware of staff"}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had in any establishment of this category. (Moes, Chipotle, or Salsaritas) I've been to other locations before and they have been fine but this one...wow. First off, the guy preparing the food was so rude to us, it was uncomfortable. I just wanted a steak and cheese quesadilla, with a side of rice, and I had to ask for the rice twice at first. Then my boyfriend ordered his food and he told the guy that he wanted salsa in a cup on the side for his tacos, and the guy looked up at him and left the cup completely empty in the box. We also ordered chips and queso. When we got to the register to pay, (another gentlemen was there who was actually very polite,) I noticed that my side of rice was missing so I asked for it again and the same guy that made our food filled up a cup halfway of the rice and I (kid you not) put a lid on it and slammed it down next to the rest of our food whilst looking me directly in the face. I don't think I've ever wanted to ask someone what the heck their problem was so badly but I left it alone for the sake of my boyfriend. Plus who knows what this guy would've said/done?? Because of all of this we took the food to go. 
So then we get home, and that's when we discover my boyfriend has an empty salsa cup in the box with his tacos....um, what? That was weird. So then I begin to eat my steak quesadilla and the steak is so dry I just ended up picking it all out. My boyfriend agreed that the steak in his tacos was really dry too. And he never complains about food. Lastly, we go to eat the chips and queso, and guess what? Lol, THE CHIPS WEREN'T EVEN COOKED ALL OF THE WAY. Wow Qdoba. For the prices you guys charge, you should really make sure that your employees have some common decency. Maybe some of them need to go back to training. 
(The Hispanic guy at the register was very polite and efficient, the long haired guy was the one acting completely ridiculous.) As soon as we walked outside, my boyfriend said, wow that guy was a total a** hole what the heck was his problem??
And he never complains about restaurant employees especially since he used to manage at a McDonalds for a few years when he was in his twenties. 
Anyway, needless to say, we will NOT be returning. I'll stick with Salsarita's, they've always been my favorite anyway. And they're a heck of a lot more affordable."}
{"text":"Food is good and service is excellent.  Came here after the gym and the guys were friendly and built me a custom meal per my request (since im on a lean down diet).  The meal really hit the spot.. Definitely be back here again!!"}
{"text":"Terrible not as good as chipotle more expensive and the lady that made my burrito was very mean never going there again"}
{"text":"Typically, I prefer qdoba over chipotle. But I was disappointed in the quality of the food in this particular location. 

I am a big Qdoba fan. I go to college in Oakland and two years ago, I literally are at Qdoba every week, I love it! But this location just didn't cut it for me last time I went. 

I ordered a veggie quesadilla. Easy right? Something that can't be messed up? Wrong. The woman working was very nice, although they appeared to be pretty disorganized in the kitchen. She asked if I wanted any rice on my quesadilla to fill it out a little more and I said sure why not. 

Basically, the rice wasn't cooked enough, there was barely any cheese on my quesadilla and it was tasteless and falling apart. The best part of the entire meal was the side of guacamole. 

I still love Qdoba, but I won't return to this location."}
{"text":"Qdoba is always a win for me. I love their tacos, nachos, quesadillas.. they are all good. Their salsas are fresh, their queso is delish and their guac is so good. You can't go wrong here. This location in particular is great- it's really spacious and a great place for students or anyone on a budget. I came here a lot during undergrad because they had student specials. Their staff has always been attentive and pleasant as well. Taco Tuesday anyone?! YUM."}
{"text":"ordered 1 chicken burrito through uber eats. how don't you put chicken in a chicken burrito. is it really that hard. smh."}
{"text":"I brought my kids here tonight for a change from typical fast food.  The restaurant was busy but they seemed prepared with a number of people working so we received our order pretty quick.  The store has been clean each time I've went there.  This time we did to go so I did not stay long."}
{"text":"Sure, I'll review Qdoba. My friend Elizabeth and I were waiting for our field trip to the Natural History Museum to start, were hungry, and figured we'd go here due to our similar love of pseudo-Mexican food.

It fronts the intersection of Euclid and Mayfield, giving an interesting view into the intersection, where people and cars fly by on their respective ways. You can try to find street parking, OR, there's a metered lot in the back on Mayfield.

This place is pretty darn good...I'd need to go a few more times before giving a better review than four stars...as is with all fast food places, their value lies in consistency...and, well...value.

It's kind of pricey, as a meal (there are several things...quesadillas, tacos, 3 cheese nachos...and I think burritos. I got the tacos, with steak. Elizabeth got a pork quesadilla. 

My tacos were awesome, with a slightly lesser grade of steak than say Chipotle. BUT...a major mistake is having too high a grade of meat on tacos. I don't want to be gnawing through fat in my steak chunks, which is what happens with Chipotle every single time. They have a bunch of stuff you can put on them, different salsas, peppers, onions, sour cream, etc. The lettuce was a bit strange, but the peppers and onions were better than...again, Chipotle, which is I'm sure their main competitor (and probably their inspiration to even open at all).

Elizabeth's quesadilla was a bit soggy, but she claimed it was awesome.

And hey...they had sweet tea on tap. That's an auto-extra star.

Again, the price was a bit much...my tacos and drink were $8 and change. 

BUT, great food, and in a spectacular location. If you're heading to the museums, it's the perfect place to eat quick.

Also, an extra note, the employees here seem to be pretty into it. Many seem to be Case students."}
{"text":"4x a week I'm here - I love it! Great service too!! And no extra charge for guacamole :) my kids love it!"}
{"text":"Although I have enjoyed Qdoba in the past, this location is not one of my favorites. Due to lack of options in this area however, I find myself there occasionally out of necessity. I will not make that mistake again.

Despite the fact that my friend and I arrived at 11:30, the chicken in my burrito bowl was cold and dry. The black beans and brown rice weren't much better. His quesadilla was okay.

The workers are friendly enough and the place was clean, but I can't tolerate mediocre food. Since it has been better at other times, you still might want to give it a shot in a pinch but I'm done."}
{"text":"I love me some Qdoba, but I will always be a Chipotle girl. However, you can't go wrong with either. This location has always been super fast and food had always been made fresh. The manager here is also very nice. There have been multiple times were we will come in and they will honor our coupon, but not redeem it so we can use it again :-)

The chips and queso are clutch and you can't go wrong with unlimited guac on everything. I recommend the chicken burrito bowl with extra corn and grilled veggies for starters. I love brown rice, but I would opt for the white rice here. It just tastes better!"}
{"text":"Love this place.always fresh and fast, except on taco Tuesdays. If I had one issue, it would be that they need another drink machine"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Las Vegas, Qdoba is a must. The staff is friendly and they always get me in and out within 5 minutes. Chicken queso bowl is always on point!! Chicken is fresh and hot! Love!!!"}
{"text":"Waaaaaaaay better than Chipotle. Cheaper, better quality products, they don't charge for queso and guacamole, and the line isn't for 20 minutes! Plus the employees are friendly & patient with me as I navigated through the menu. The chips are also delicious!"}
{"text":"Better than moes, but worse than chipotle. Think of it as a chipotle will queso. Went pretty late so the ingredients didn't taste very fresh."}
{"text":"Called to place a catering order and they rudely asked me to call back in 20 minutes b/c they were busy. WTF? How about I'll call one of the other 20 Qdoba's in town to give my money to."}
{"text":"Pretty good! My boyfriend works down the street from here and when he has time to grab some lunch or asks me to pick up lunch for him, Qdoba is always something we agree on. I absolutely LOVE the fact that nothing costs extra. You pay one flat fee for whatever you choose (tacos, burrito, salad) and all the ingredients are all on the table, literally. We have only tried their taco salad with tostada shell bowl. It comes out to just a little less than $10 but that could feed both of us fine. I'm not sure what took us so long to try Qdoba, we have just started going here this year. But we are glad we did."}
{"text":"This Qdoba is just like all the others, as far as food goes.  The meat is great and they have a better selection of salsas than Chipotle.  The queso is amazing, every time.  Go here hungry and in the mood to consume a large burrito.

The only nice perk of this particular location is that it has a big open window that looks onto Fish Hatchery Rd.  Not exactly a great view, but it does make the place look really big.  During the summer it is fun to see the mix of pedestrians that use the road, as this location is right on the edge of the yuppie and ghetto parts of Fitchburg."}
{"text":"Love love love their food! Definitely choose this over cafe rio any day. The staff here has moderate customer service not bad and not great no complaints here. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is we just came from there entered the restaurant at 8:03pm and they don't close until 10pm, already had their chairs up, mop out, and grills looked like they were being worked on to get cleaned. The young lady who helped us had a light blue shirt on and she seemed as though she wanted to get the orders out of the way and like she was tired lol I get it but come on 2 hours earlier? Anywho love this place love the food and the staff is ok!! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Eating at Qdoba reminds me of eating at Chipotle' except a little more on the mexican side. I mostly eat there on longer lunch breaks because I'm never sure how big the crowd is gonna be. Another major factor is that Qdoba's manager comes by my work (a block away) and drops off 2 for 1 coupons, which really is a no brainer. 

I like how all the ingredients are laid out in front of you, the workers are pretty efficient and quick to choice selection as well. I prefer the soft Burritos with Carne' Asada and corn, some black beans, Guac and Sour Cream for a super filling meal.

At the same time, I can't see dropping $8 on lunch when I can get a massive mondo Carne Asada Burrito right down the street at Roberto's. 

But, the place is clean, The bathrooms are usually spotless, and it's usually busy at lunch time. It's twice the distance (2 blocks) from my work which deters me sometimes, and though I like Qdoba, I usually can't find a spot close to it to park with my limited time due to gym crowd and workers parked in the parking lot. 

I enjoy this place and will come back every so often. I don't believe they deserved quite 4 stars, maybe about 3.5.

Cheers!

{"text":"This is my new spot for tacos. Food is great and customer service is even better. It's a nice touch when the cashier offers to carry your food to the table when he sees you bought more than you can carry.  I will return."}
{"text":"My review is solely based on the nachos which are the bomb diggity bomb. This place is exactly as my bestie described it. Sort of like Chipotle, but better, much better. 

The few times I've had the nachos they were just great. I have tried the shredded beef, the pulled pork and the lime chicken which were all in my opinion properly seasoned and fresh. So were all the toppings. All of the toppings are great, yes ALL of them. Yes, I have tried them all. Nope, no shame. The spicy cheese is to die for, ask them to spread it all over erryting!

It really boils down to taste. If you're open minded like me... stop in, and try it, try it all. Not all at once, but little by little until you hit your sweet spot. The customer service is great. They greet customers the second they walk in thru the doors.  I've always taken my orders to go. The place looks very clean and organized. 

Tip: If you are a beer lover like me, get yourself some cold ice beers before you go grab yourself some nachos, you're welcome."}
{"text":"I went to Qdoba with a friend to get a quick dinner. The employee that took care of use was completely rude. He asked us in a rude way \"what do you want\" without even getting a minute to look at the menu. He then when we were deciding on the toppings we wanted he would ask \"umm are you done already\". If it wasn't for the fact that we were hungry my friend and I would have walked out.

I will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"The new tacos are pretty good - I usually stick with the Drunken Yardbird. I mean, you can't really go wrong with chicken and avocado....Their queso has a spicy kick to it and it's delicious. Also they have one of those fancy Coke machines where you can create whatever drink you want. When I go during lunch it has been fairly empty and the service is quick."}
{"text":"On the rare times I get into Pittsburgh, I usually try to go on some sort of excursion to get food I can't find in Greensburg.  On this particular trip, I was coming in to get my car serviced around the corner, so without a vehicle, I wandered into Qdoba.

While I prefer the base ingredients and regular burritos at Chipotle, QDoba has one ingredient Chipotle does not: queso.  And their queso is delicious.  Other than that, I can't get too excited about it, although I do appreciate that guacamole is \"free\" now, and that they offer whole wheat tortillas so I can pretend my queso burrito is healthy.  I like their pork, but I'm not the biggest fan of their rice or fajita veggies.

Not the best, fanciest, or most authentic burrito around, but the store was clean, the employees were friendly and fast, and I got my fill of cheesy calorie-bomb deliciousness while my Mini was in the shop, so overall I'll give them an \"A-OK.\""}
{"text":"Typical Qdoba location, set up is almost exactly the same as other location.  What set this one apart from the other locations is that it was able to handle the influx flow of customers that seemed to form a line to the door.

They worked efficiently to make the food as fast as they could.  The guy in the kitchen area was what really made them go so fast.  It was like he knew what was going to be going out soon and had it sitting there waiting for them when they were about to turn around.  The lady at the head of the line made it a smooth process too.  She had everything set up and was on to the next person.

One of the major things that I don't like is that it seems that the portion sizes have gone down since my last endeavor to a Qdoba.  I got a naked burrito and the bowl it was in seems to have shrunk.  I was still kind of hungry afterwards."}
{"text":"I used too go here a lot but thought I would try one last time. Same experience. Used to be good food an still somewhat just ok but used to be better. The customer service is the worst. Guy making my burritos not friendly at all nor guy taking my money. I will take my business elsewhere. QDOBA just FYI get friendlier people to make your food or soon you will go out of business. No one wants to eat somewhere with bad service an halfway good food."}
{"text":"Always a good place to get filled up-twice even sometimes. Service at this location has always been the best out of any location I've been to. I really wish they still had the Mole and a few other choices that made this place unique.

Hands down though, this will always beat some other greasy fast food place if you are in a hurry. Oh yeah, $1 taco's on Tuesday's make for a great, quick, cheap meal."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, they barely give you any food, the food look like it's been sitting there for a while and when we asked for fresh food they gave us an attitude. I love Qdoba but will never come back to this location"}
{"text":"I wish I'd gotten the chance to try the food. I walked in today at around 5 pm and I see the manager standing in the kitchen eating. When he saw me he turned around & put some gloves on. Already two health code violations in this visit: he was eating in the kitchen and didn't wash his hands before helping me. While I stared at the menu for a minute, he scooped some rice into a container and put it aside. I guess I took too long to decide because he huffed out, \"Let me know when you're ready\", grabbed the rice, and continued to eat. I turned to tell my fiance I didn't want to eat there anymore because of how rude this guy was and we walked out. A couple minutes later I went in again and asked the other guy behind the counter for his manager's name. When he said \"Danny\" the manager, who was helping other customers, turned and saw me. I told Danny that I live across the street & would never come back because of his attitude, to which he responded \"What attitude?\", WITH that same rude attitude. No apology, no attempt to explain himself, no attempt to keep a potential regular. So no business from me."}
{"text":"Well I hate giving only one star because I really like their food, but just had an experience that left a bad taste in my mouth. While dining in I felt water drop on my head. I look up and the a/c is dripping on me. I tell the staff, and a kid moves a table that wasn't in the drip zone farther away but does nothing with the place where I was sitting. I ask to speak with the manager. None on duty, according to this kid. I ask him if it bothers him that water is dripping on customers heads and possibly in their food. He says he can't do anything about it. I suggested maybe moving the table and chair from under the drip, perhaps closing off the area. He moves one chair then leaves. Health department sign gave them a 96.5 rating...inspector must have come by with a completely different staff on duty..."}
{"text":"They have been running a $1 taco Tuesday special for a while now, and really can't be beat.  Choice of hard or soft shell, choice of chicken, ground beef, steak or carnitas and whatever toppings ya want. I like a combination of the habanero and corn salsa.  Check and see if your local Qdoba has same special and you got yourself a solid lunch for under 5 bucks."}
{"text":"Review is for the owner, who is a complete dbag.  He tried fighting me once when I worked at the parking lot around the corner because I wouldn't let him park for free.  Who harasses students doing their job trying to pay for Nordenberg's salary?  Anyways, food isn't bad, won't go back due to said dbag."}
{"text":"Coming to Qdoba is a treat for me. Since they have a few locations, they have their variations to select from. One fav is their chicken mango salad.  It's a light meal and has the mexican citrus flavor. The restaurant is clean and great service."}
{"text":"My favorite place ever! So good and good prices! They don't even charge for guacamole. Great customer service as well!"}
{"text":"Steak quesadilla... That's all you need to have a satisfactory experience. Also get the queso, it's fire."}
{"text":"Qdoba needs to que up their service and cleanliness.  I was quite disappointed walking in to this location to find shreds of lettuce on the floor, sticky chairs, and trash under tables.  I know it isn't a five star restaurant, but cleanliness is mandatory, no matter what type of restaurant it is."}
{"text":"My family really loves dining at this place. We are big fans of the no upcharge for all the add-ons like queso, guac, fajita veggies, Etc. Their taco salad is delicious and we love their habanero brisket and queso! It's usually not very busy which means the service is really fast."}
{"text":"Ive dined here dozens of times. The menu is not explained well all. The guy today working thd steam line was an all out jerk to me today. That's pitting it mildly. I was in around 2pm and got really bad customer service. Generally speaking , its clean and the staff is pretty friendly. Its a bit overpriced considering what you get. Watch out for the sneaky over charges on grilled vegetable items. Guacamole is 1.19 extra. Whoa. The salads are .20 more than they have posted on the menu. The food is good though. Lunch for me was 8.42 today."}
{"text":"Their air conditioning was broken. Walken in. Walked out. It was almost as hot as outside. It is 110+ outside. In situations like this they should close the store until they fix their ac. I couldn't stay and eat if I wanted to. First of all, it cannot be safe having food out in that heat. Second, I needed the cool to enjoy the food. Close the doors until you fix the ac."}
{"text":"It's Qdoba so it's good as always. This place gets really crowded at lunch time but the people that work there are very efficient so even if the line is out the door you will only be waiting for about 5 minutes until you can place your order. While the inside is small, a lot of people take their food to go so there is usually somewhere where you can find a place to sit."}
{"text":"Me and my husband did not have a good experience when we went on one occasion.  We ordered chicken quesadillas and our chicken according to their standards was \"charred\".  I was not fond of their \"charred\" chicken!   The last time me and my husband went to this location we opted for the ground beef instead to avoid any \"charred\" chicken.  There meat could have used a little more flavor, but it beat their chicken that's for sure!  We will probably not be frequenting this location very often."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. I have been to Qdoba before and have always had fast, friendly service and decent meals. We recently moved to the Ahwatukee area and decided to stop in at this location for a quick dinner. It was not busy, there was one other couple in front of us in line. Standing in line I noticed a large pile of chicken sitting to the side of the grill with flies buzzing around it and quickly decided I would try the steak instead.  I do not know if they were running out of inventory or if the staff was just being lazy but never in my life have I seen such embarrassing sized portions from any Qdoba. My favorite part of Qdoba has always been eating half and saving half for later, this time none of it was worth saving.  As we watched our food being made we knew something was not right, so I politely asked why the portions seemed to be much (MUCH) smaller than what we were used to. The girl making our burritos literally rolled her eyes, laughed and offered extra meat for an extra charge. I did not want extra meat, I wanted the same size bowl I was used to getting. We declined, and she seemingly pawned us off on the other girl working.  As we approached the register we asked another employee (possibly the manager), why the portions seemed to be half of what we are normally used to getting at Qdoba.  She seemed nervous, but assured us the portion sizes were correct. After our 2 minute car trip home and opening our bag of food we realized this $18 meal would definitely not satisfy our hunger. To top it off, the steak tasted like it had been soaked in some type of oil, and everything was completely cold! Not  even lukewarm, cold. I hate to complain, but after this past visit we will not be returning to Qdoba. 

I have attached a picture of the food we received (next to an 8oz bottle of vitamins for comparison) for viewers to see how small the burrito actually is."}
{"text":"Qdoba is the anti-Chipotle.  Much better quality food and A+++ service at this location.  They always make it a pleasant experience even during the buys weekday lunch hour.  I enjoy the queso cheese sauce with everything and the habanero sauce is just spicy enough"}
{"text":"First time at this location.  Went in at lunchtime.  Only one server/cashier working but she did a great job moving us thru.  There were at least 6 people in line.  Had a naked chicken burrito with queso and no rice.  Excellent."}
{"text":"Its fast fresh Mex.  Great service at every location.  The naked burrito with no rice is a great hi pro / low carb meal. Mexican Gumbo is also a favorite.  A+  Qdoba rewards card is a bonus.  Every tenth entree is FREE."}
{"text":"Fast. Open until 3am on bar nights. Perfect break from the library. Lots of seating. Way more options than Chipotle. Yum."}
{"text":"Great location and great food! I ordered the gumbo bowl, which is delicious. Their chicken and pulled pork are probably the best meats. The portion sizes are very good too for the price. They have 3 different kinds of Queso, the Pico is always fresh, and there are a slew of varying sauces to put on your tacos, burritos, and on the bowls. The manager is really outgoing and so are the employees, and they give UNCC students discounts too. 

BIG PRO: They don't charge EXTRA for Queso, Guacamole, and veggies!!! FREE. I just about fell over when they told me this, started recently after 1/1/15

I found this Qdoba better then Moes and Chipotle- which doesn't even offer queso because of \"preservatives\", like what kind of Mexican-America restaurant doesn't offer queso? They don't play cliche spanish music either. Good place."}
{"text":"I enjoy Qdoba quite a bit and definitely will try to make my way here if I'm in the area, hungry, and am with a willing crowd. A couple of weeks ago I was with my parents and we decided to pop in for some lunch. Lo and behold it was free burrito day! Buy a drink and get a full-sized burrito. Qdoba has excellent food that you build yourself with the help of an employee (reminds me of a Tex-Mex Subway) that's always hot and tasty. They also have a free style soda machine, which is a plus. I'm usually just an unsweet tea drinker but the temptation of vanilla ginger ale or strawberry cream soda is a siren song that I just cannot resist. 

The restaurant has always been clean and very efficient every time I've been there with friendly staff. Give it a try and make sure to get a side of queso. It's quite good, too."}
{"text":"Qdoba has edible Mexican food (that's not saying much since I LOVE vegetables and it makes up for the taste) but they were not very clean and the service was average. Average as in wow doesn't anyone ever smile anymore? The quality of their ingredients is so-so. Nothing about this joint was worth remembering. Stingy meat portions, too."}
{"text":"Overeating, supersized, excess upon excess...I tell ya, with all the extravagance of this country, savvy Americans clean up pretty good. Case in point: My outrageously delicious & generously portioned KID-sized lunch at Qdoba.

Some weeks ago, a friend mentioned that the steak here is even better than at \"the other\" popular fast-casual Mexican grill chain. Wrote that off as woefully improbable, but then found myself both hungry for meat and steps away from a Qdoba yesterday. 

Blindfold me, place me in here, remove all signage and then take the blindfold off, I'd swear I was at \"the other\" place. Almost identical in layout....even how the food is displayed. I don't know which chain came first, so cannot point my copycat finger accurately.

Anyway...sorry, yes, back to the point I was trying to make! The meat is wonderfully seasoned but mostly comparable. What DID lift my lids were 3 things: the FREE guacamole, the size of the \"kids\" meal, and the free cheesy dipping sauces. It was even too much for someone who intentionally eats small meals to magnify the taste experience and leave a little hunger in her. (I dine a bite short of satisfaction. Keeps me alert, energized and on top of my game.) My meal, quesadilla with half chicken & half steak, was a clear 10. Best of all...the total came to a whopping $4.32. Unreal. Thank goodness for America. Greed is GOOD."}
{"text":"The food was great, the ingredients are always fresh, I got the burrito bowel and you have a choice of chicken, steak, or pork, white or brown rice, pinto or black beans along with your choice of toppings.  The burrito bowel was very filling and so were the tortilla chips they are made fresh and so is the salsa.  The staff was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Not sure if I have ever eaten here before but I tried it yesterday and it was okay. Had a veggie bowl with white rice, black beans, veggies, salsa and sour cream. It was good but it was lacking some type of flavor like a spice. I also had their tortilla soup and i wish it actually had tortillas strips to give it the crunch but I liked that it was spicy definitely had a kick to it. Service was good, the guy who took my order and prepared it was really nice and funny. Maybe next time i go ill add extra salsa and a dash of salt."}
{"text":"Qdoba..Qdoba oh how I've missed you! I am an absolute fan on this place! It has yet to fail me! I use to eat here at least 3-4 times a week a few years ago! I relocated out of Las Vegas and wasn't never successful in finding another Qdoba! Chipotle is good but over rated and although they have pretty much the same concept I love how they aren't cheap with the portions of meat! I came here today for lunch and tried out that seasonal Mango Taco Salad bowl with chicken! Extremely tasty and the guy who made it was very generous with my toppings so who would complain about that? I must've arrived at an excellent time because I kid you not there was all but 2 people in the place when I arrived which resulted in my being helped immediately! Staff was great and customer service was on point! I'm glad to be back in Vegas and close to Qdoba again!"}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken quesadilla. Food was great and the service was very quick. I came around 2pm so it wasn't that crowded at all. Got a lot of food for a reasonable price. Can't complain."}
{"text":"OMG this is my favorite place to eat!!
staff are very friendly and make food exactly as you request. Unlimited queso and guac (what could be better?) and the ingredients are very fresh. I have to eat there every 3 day otherwise I feel my life goes wrong. Never went to Chipotle again after eating at this place! 
Perfection! Keep it plz!"}
{"text":"This place has changed recently. The menu isn't as good as it once was and the service has drastically dropped. I went for lunch on a Saturday and it wasn't very busy. The guy preparing orders was so rude. He acted like it was a huge inconvenience for people to order food. My order was basic - grilled chicken burrito. His attitude was terrible. I watched a lady walk up & ask for a to go container & he was also rude to her. There's no sense in acting like that when you have to work with the public. Work in the back or go get another job! At least my food was actually warm this time."}
{"text":"I probably come here every Friday afternoon. I order a taco salad to go & queso. I love the food here. Very nice staff as well."}
{"text":"Multiple trips have taught me that this place is consistent and filling, but it shouldn't blow one's mind. Chicken: tasty; staff: friendly; servings: plentiful."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place.  I generally like the quality of the products, the price is very reasonable as well.  The obvious comparison is to Chipotle (and I have to tell you, though I like both, I do think it is freaking obnoxious the way that Chipotle has decided to open up right next to all of the existing local Qdoba locations that were here first--i mean alls fair and all, but it is a d%ck move).   In any case the quality of the ingredients seems a cut above at Chipotle vis a vis Qdoba, but Qdoba has better overall menu variety and selection. 

Qdoba may not be very authentic, however, that said, I am not a culinary anthropologist.  If I was traveling to a far flung destination in Mexico, I would want to make sure that the food I was eating was authentic and true to the \"experience\" I was looking for.  When I am hunter gathering for dinner, I am interested in reasonable prices, and food that it just plain Yummy.  Qdoba qualifies."}
{"text":"I kind of like cafe rio a little better. I think it's kind of expensive. $8 for a burrito is meh. Bring me a California burrito from Roberto's. Flavor of my steak burrito was good. But could use more meat. Not my first choice for Mexican food"}
{"text":"Since the other Mexican fast food chain opened half a block away some time ago, I would only come here if it's too crowded down that place. This place is never as popular as the other one and for good reasons. Personally, I find that here tortilla never gets properly steamed and always comes out more cardboard-y, chicken doesn't taste as flavorful or juicy, white rice seems undercooked half the time and the staff gives more of a IDGAF vibe. The only redeeming quality here is that they have queso and guac cost is built-in."}
{"text":"Still a half star...... went on Sat.eve 6pm. Joint still empty except for a couple homeless guys camping out and watching us eat.  Still all cold food including the tortillas. 8.00 for a crummy cold burrito. Asked cashier kindly if he could cut the burrito in half?  He squarely said No, we are not allowed to cut them but there are plastic knives by the garbage can.   Go out of business....plssssss"}
{"text":"I went in here just the other day, I wasnt to hungry so i just grabbed a side of chips and cheese. Man do they make a good cheese lol. I have yet to try anything else at this place but ill have to go back again sometime soon."}
{"text":"Still same old Qdoba. However, there is a new Mexican place right across the street called Luchita's Express.  It is much much better and I recommend it!  They use organic ingredients and manage to be cheaper than Qdoba."}
{"text":"Wow.  I have never seen a bowl of chips and salsa I didn't love (and inhale) but I have seen it now.  I like to think of myself as an burrito joint expert and Qdoba lacked flavor and taste.  It just tasted bland.  The rice was bland, the meat was bland, and the grilled veggies were bland.  The chips tasted bland and just weren't good.  It was a sad day when I had to dispose of the chips because they sucked so much.  Overall the experience sucked."}
{"text":"I followed Nick ' advice and had the gumbo (mislabeled the picture because I was in the mood for jambalaya). 

Very tasty.  I ordered the pulled pork with pinto beans.  A very good soup that hit the spot.

The only knock was the cleanliness.   There were only two folks working and they were very busy filling or see orders (thus why I kept it at 4 stars)

A great option before or after a movie.

Atmosphere - very fast food like

Price - my gumbo and a bottle of water was $10.  You get free chips and queso if you show your movie stub.

Service - great. - the whole process was just a few minutes

I will be back."}
{"text":"The food at Qdoba is OK - it's not quite as good as Chipotle, but is OK for a burrito fix. Since the grand opening mailer coupons ran out I haven't felt the need to visit when I prefer Chipotle that's located in the same complex.

I read Matthew C's review regarding his drama with the gift certificate and while I never experienced this, my wife and I took \"$5 worth of food free\" coupons in that we received in the mail and the cashier said we were required to purchase a drink in order to use this offer. This was not mentioned anywhere on the mailer we received and eventually I was able to use the coupon as advertised. It made me feel a bit awkward though.

Decent food, but I'll stick with Chipotle."}
{"text":"Doesn't even come close to Chipotle. Funny thing is, I LOVED Q'doba so much when I lived in California! The service was always excellent and the food tasted fresh. Here in Vegas, my Q'doba experiences have never impressed me...this Rainbow location in particular.

They're never that busy when I've been but their service always seems impatient and sub-par. I ordered the naked vegetarian burrito which includes guacamole. Sadly, the veggies aren't included (lame...especially since it's a VEGETARIAN entre) so beware because they'll sometimes offer you the vegetables without telling you about the extra cost.

They also have quite a lot of trouble processing coupons or certificates. One lady went so far as to have my husband email her his certificate from his phone because she insisted on her need to have a paper copy in hand (other locations don't seem to have this problem).

Whether we make it through smoothly or not, they never really seem all that nice and while I don't need to be catered to and coddled, it is nice if someone at least acknowledges you when you're addressing them or completing your transaction."}
{"text":"It has been a while since my husband and I have eaten at Qdoba. We have eaten at the Tempe location which is now closed. We were in the area and decided to eat at the Ahwatukee location. 

We both are vegetarian and ordered the bowl. They were out of black beans and fajita veggies at 2 pm on a Saturday and said they were done for the day!! I was pretty shocked. We usually eat at chipotle and have never ever run into this issue. If they are out of something they would ask you to wait until they cook more, never have we left chipotle not getting what we wanted. 

I do not think we will be going to Qdoba again, gonna stick to Chipotle."}
{"text":"This is your standard Tex-Mex 'order at the counter' joint. You go through an assembly line, where you choose your meal...and then you choose between black and pinto beans, several different types of salsas, and of course cheese, lettuce, sour cream, and guacamole (which is 95cents extra!). 

My significant other LOVES Qdoba, and I swear before I came along he ate here at least 5x/week. Now I try to keep us to twice a month, if I can.  We often get it as take-out on one of the busy weeknights that I don't feel like cooking. In fact, I can't remember the last time I ate IN here.

It can be really good and fresh, but they are VERY inconsistent. Sometimes it's excellent, sometimes not so much. If you go in within 45 mins to an hour before they close (for takeout/fast food, mind you) - they aren't likely to cook you up a fresh batch of anything. If they are out of chicken, they are out of chicken. Seems a little crazy to me, but there you are. 

I usually eat vegetarian here... the cheese quesadilla with pico and salsa verde, or the naked vegetarian taco salad are my go-to dishes.

Back in the day when they were called Zteca (who else remembers that?) they served margaritas. Wish they would bring them back!"}
{"text":"Their meat is seasoned to perfection and salsa is fresh and homemade tasting. L O V E this place!!"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh. 

Service is fast. 

Guacamole is better than Chipotle hands down!"}
{"text":"Our first time here. The two staff were very helpful. We are on weightwatchers and were able to pick and choose what we wanted to eat. All the meats were lean. It was great and tasted very good. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Although the prices here are higher than in California, fiancé said we HAD to come here because she was bummed the one in our area had shut down after only 6 months. Probably because it wasn't charging Nevada prices?? 

Anyway... pretty straightforward restaurant for Chipotle-style food. And conveniently located near a 24 hour fitness for the gym junkies who want a healthy choice after their workout. 

The guy who prepped my tacos I believe was the prep cook who came over to help because they were getting busy... which came out to be a good thing because he ended up putting good-sized portions on my tacos that I ended up having a chicken bowl after my tacos were finished :)"}
{"text":"It's pretty much like a Chipotle restaurant, but these guys have a lot more options, including Mexican Gumbo and Tortilla Soup (great if you're feeling a little under the weather). I've been here twice now, and recently enjoyed the taco salads. The ingredients are very fresh and I love the taco shell bowl for the taco salad. The lettuce isn't as crisp as Chipotle's, but it is the greener part of the romaine lettuce. This doesn't translate well with hot foods, but with the cold salads, it's awesome. 

As far as price goes, 2 people can eat here for about $18 including beverages."}
{"text":"Food is good standard....but one if employees will not put enough veggies on your burrito bowl. He sprinkles the pico , corn and other sides. If asked for more the amount goes down even more. I have eaten in so many other qdobas. 
This one cries for a new management."}
{"text":"This is exactly like chipotle, well not exactly, but it's very close. I'm a huge fan of burrito bowls and the ones at Qdoba were pretty good. One thing that I do like about this franchise over Chipotle is that the ingredients taste like they have less sodium, which is very good from a health perspective!"}
{"text":"So I was always wondering what kind of food Qdoba was. Little did I know what that it was similar to other places I have ate at. 
The concept is the same as a Chipotle or Cafe Rio. You tell the first person you see what you want and they prepare what you want on your burrito, taco, salad, etc. The food is good, but it is not worth the price. Chipotle is virtually the same price and the same food. If you want convenience, go to the closer one to you because it is virtually the same."}
{"text":"This location just opened across from Progressive Insurance and real close to 271 on Wilson Mills. The food was very good - they have many more options than Chipotle, and unlike that restaurant, at least some of the meat is not spicy! One of those places where you order and move through the line selecting the ingredients in your burrito/salad/tacos, etc. Several kinds of sauce, salads, salsas, soup & more. 

A little pricey unless you have a coupon (about $6-7/ entree & this does not include a drink). They also had some trouble ringing up our food at the register. I did notice that my friend's burrito was about half the size of mine, even though they were the same price (hopefully these are just flukes, since they are new).

The resaurant itself is very cute and clean, but there are a ton of small tables crammed in there so it feels very claustrophobic.

Servers were friendly and came to each table asking if patrons needed anything or if they could clear the table. 

I'd definitely make a return trip, maybe in a few weeks when they have worked out some of the kinks."}
{"text":"Come in just about every other week, not once have I had to wait in line! Quick, friendly service !! Plus, that spicy queso sauce is what pushed it over the top when compared to cafe rio or ecoli stricken chipotle. Just alittle pricey but definitely worth it"}
{"text":"I've always loved Qdoba over it's main competitor (both founded in Denver, 2 years apart). Seriously though, if the names were stripped from the building one would be hard pressed to name the place correctly.

All the ingredients are fresh and the prices are very reasonable. Heck we pay more at Taco Bell  for vastly inferior product. The taco salad (~$9) is quite large and the number of options is huge.  The knockout taco combo (3 for $9) is definitely worth the deal. So far my favorite has to be the two timer taco. I do wish that of the offerings there was a truly spicy one. Then again I eat ghost peppers, so that could be a me thing.

Parking lot is huge and easy to access on this always busy road. Bonus is the stop light. Store is very clean, the employees friendly."}
{"text":"I like this location. The staff is always warm and inviting and get to know regulars. I think the food quality and selection are better than Chipotle and at a greater value. Would give 5 stars, but they are not a full service restaurant with table side service, so would be unfair to the hardworking wait staff of those types of establishments. Try it! I am sure you will like it too!"}
{"text":"Boo - Qdoba! Boo! 

I had a blast hanging out with you back in the day - when I was kickin' it back at Case Western during Undergrad.  Now, I fear - that love affair is over.  Long ago are the days where we would study in your dining room, enjoying \"bottomless\" chips and cheese from your lovely staff.  

Fast forward to today, where you are not attentive, and rarely get any orders correct!  I wrote no sour cream.  Why is my bowl covered in white goo? ... again! 

It is possible to get back on track - I believe in you!"}
{"text":"Good for Gluten Free. I had the Bowl. Easy in and out. Located close to Case Western."}
{"text":"It's a Tuesday.  It's supposed to be a Taco Tuesday after the movies with a small but adequate discounted nachos with ticket stub.

The first thing I notice is the lack of ticket stub promotion signs.  That's ok.  At least it's still Taco Tuesday.  Then I notice the distinct lack of Taco Tuesday promotion signs.  Now I'm mildly annoyed.  Ah well, that's ok.  I can still get some delicious crunchy tacos.  They're out of crunchy tacos.  That's three strikes, Qdoba.  Three.  Strikes.  Apparently in my abomination of baseball I allow four strikes, because I bought soft tacos, which are in fact far inferior to the satisfying crunch of the crunchy taco.

The quality of the food was still very good, but I was moderately disappointed walking in the door and mildly disappointed walking out the door."}
{"text":"Bar upstairs!

This doesn't get 5 stars because Chipotle is superior. But this is also not a review for food. This particular Qdoba is home of a bar upstairs. Attention college Students: this is the CHEAPEST bar in all of Pittsburgh. Yuengling is always 2 dollars for a pint, and other drinks and shots are 2-3 dollars as well.

I think it was on a Friday or Saturday, they have specials on their fishbowls. Beware of the fishbowls though. They don't really come in fishbowls, just pitchers. And they all taste terrible. However, there is a lot of booze in them so if you are looking to get plastered, go for the lime flavored. That's the most tolerable. AVOID BLUE!

Anyways, I like this place because it's small, and you can't smoke here because it's a restaurant so if you aren't a smoker, you don't come out of the place smelling like tobacco like many other bars in the city."}
{"text":"My one star rating is for just one simple thing.... the SERVICE BLOWS! I do not are if you are having a bad day, or if you hate your job, just be normal and decent to your customers when they are in there.  

I have been in here a number of times.... I have tried placing catering orders here too only to decide to take my business elsewhere because of the rude non-customer focused staff.  Thank God for Moe's Southwest Grill for bailing me out of catering debacles caused by this location not doing their job.  

I had the final straw today when they were not busy at all, and the woman at the check out was too lazy to even get our cups and then I asked if I should just take them and she snapped at me and said \"go ahead\" while walking away from me (I also had to pull my own receipt from the register).  

As much as I love Mexican food and need that quick lunch at times, I am thinking I will not be returning here (which is sad as I live next door!).  If the management of this reads this, do something about your staff!"}
{"text":"With all of the constant hype around Chipotle, I had pretty low expectations when I decided to try Qdoba for the first time. I was VERY pleasantly surprised at not only their selection, but also the quality of their food. I'm a fan!The staff here was extremely friendly and courteous!  

They have a similar set-up to Chipotle where you can order either tacos, quesadillas, salad, etc. or do a burrito/burrito bowl. I went for a brisket quesadilla and it was not only huge enough to feed me for two meals, it was very, very delicious! They have a few different kinds of queso as well. You have queso and you win me over INSTANTLY.



Also, Qdoba doesn't charge extra for Guac or queso on anything! I never understood why guac was so much extra at Chipotle anyway..."}
{"text":"Qdoba on Rainbow needs to learn how to honor coupons that have no expiration date, and especially for not displaying any sign in the counter window that said coupons are no longer honored. Keeping the sign in the backroom because \"customers who had those coupons have been in before and know that we no longer accept them, so we took the sign down\" is not acceptable. On top of that, the employees at the counter could use a brush up on their customer service skills.

Righting a wrong with the coupon would have kept those in our party that went there for lunch today continuing customers. Instead, Qdoba just lost a direct few, and will spread the word to many more."}
{"text":"I haven't been to qdoba since I moved out here. I happened to be in the area and dived back in. My original experience back in Florida was not all that great, but this was incredible. They have a unique menu with tasteful options, you can see them Sautéing fresh vegetables as I ordered. The staff was very, very nice. Most importantly the food was awesome! Thanks"}
{"text":"I'm closer to the one near the Steel Plaza, but I normally walk the extra block & head here. Even though the layout is literally smushed, i kinda feel as if there is a little more seating here and that the line goes faster. I also prefer this location's Queso compared to the other location. 

I'll show my cheap side & mention that I only stop in on Taco Tuesdays and $5 burrito Fridays. Honestly, I thought I was crazy until I read Lucretiz's review- I'm like 90% sure my taco & burritos get downsized because of my size. I watch them make these full, plump tacos & burritos then when it's my turn it's like next to nothing! So thanks Lucretiz's for letting me see that I'm not truly crazy! 

NOTE: they recently added those cool Coca-Cola machines.. so if Orange Coke is your cup of tea, stop in! Also, as of February they added 2 new quesos! Queso Diablo (jalapenos & chipotle) and Queso Verde (cilantro & lime juice) Both are made from their 3-cheese queso"}
{"text":"I used to live in the area & stopped by often. Recently we stopped here on our way home from target. As alway .. it was clean, had nice employees plus a parking lot! My go to is a chicken burrito with the add on of chips & queso + drink. I loveee qdobas queso."}
{"text":"I'm usually always satisfied when I go to the downtown or Oakland location, but this location is just way off the charts. 

We stopped in one evening before a late movie to avoid the costly movie theater food.  (plus it was friday and everyone loves $5 burrito fridays!).

We went in at about 10 minutes before closing time-- which i didnt realize until we walked up & noticed the hours on the door. As we were walking in, all of the employees starred at us as if they were so confused why no one locked the door and how/why we came in this late. 

We go up to the ordering area and pretty much everything had been taken down. One nice worker was kind enough to go in the back and get the things we wanted on our burrito while a very rude female worker giggled at him because it was our fault he was doing extra work. The same  female worker said in a very bad tone \"go lock the door so no one else comes in\" The entire time she was making our burrito she was too preoccupied with the other employee to even have a quick small talk with us to earn our business in the future- it was like a sad junior high scene of flirting. It was seriously an awkward moment and I just wanted out of there!  I didn't feel welcomed and because of that the south side Q'doba will never have $1 of my hard earned money.

I can only hope that the manager sees all of the numerous terrible reviews for this location and gives them a good lesson in customer service because it is non-existent here.  I've never had an issue with downtown, oakland or shadyside/bloomfield location so we all know that it could get wayy better."}
{"text":"The Mexican Gumbo with Steak and Chicken is my favorite!   The Steak Quesadilla and the Nachos are delicious.  Prices are average, can't complain.  

Only complaint I have is the person that puts the food together always gives me too little of meat compared to Chipotle and Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"A chain place. Pretty consistent with every other Qdoba.  However, this location has outstanding customer service. The staff is friendly and always on top of their game. Generally busy establishments near the mall does not usually indicate good service but this place really meets the needs of their customers."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today -- turns out it was free burrito day! What a wonderful surprise. 

I was already eating for free because I had free gift cards from a catering order - check my tip to learn more! 

The food is OK - I'm not the biggest fast casual Mexican food fan, but their queso is tasty and the ingredients tasted fresh. 

The chips are wayyy too salt. Dial the salt down! 

I've done catering with them before and Mitch the catering manager was really easy to work with and ensure our experience went really well. 

Today when I was in the restaurant everyone was really sweet and it was incredibly busy. They all had smiles on! 

Quick and easy lunch."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and tasty. The place is lacking in tidiness. The bathroom has several water leaks and is dirty from the walls down. Dust and grease hang from the ceiling and air ducts. The dusty place that is visible to customers, makes me wonder how is the inside of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Normally real good and have positive comments about this restaurant but this experience was less than pleasurable. I got a burrito, with double meat that was def skimped on and then the queso that was added was not even warm. Server was scraping pan to make enough fit and did not even suggest I wait for a fresh batch. The food overall was not bad but def my worst customer experience here."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went to this Qdoba for lunch several months ago. There was a mouse running along a ledge close to the ceiling. Almost fell in this woman's food. Worker said they kept the place very clean. He was very nonchalant. Will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Free chips and salsa with entrees, you can't be that. Staff is friendly and personalble. Fresh chicken on the burritos. Cashier always helps us with our big orders to the table. My son loves the beef quesadillas. Love the fancy Coke products dispenser.  Never a line here."}
{"text":"The service is excellent...and the food is pretty yummy as well!  It is my little treat when I am having a bad day :)"}
{"text":"This was the first place that I ever tried Qdoba and I was hooked. I had never seen anything like this before and I was hesitant about trying it out but I had a friend who worked there so I figured, why not. Well. Got the steak fajita burrito which was terrific. 

The place is really clean and I do recall them serving beer here. The guacamole is delicious but I hate how it costs more to get it. The regular burritoes are good but I'm not really a beans fan so I usually get the steak fajita burrito."}
{"text":"Might as well say closed at 9pm... just got in from a long trip, was looking forward to a good steak, or chicken, or even a new shrimp burrito... all out of chicken, steak, and shrimp... was like 8:50pm when I walked in... if your open till 10, then you should not be running out of the three top items before it's even 9... Good thing Chipotle is across the street and is actually open till 10, walked in to fresh chicken and steak being added to the line at 9:10... watched about 5 other cars do the exact same thing I did as well..."}
{"text":"I visit various Qdoba locations frequently, including this one. This is not the best. The service is quick and friendly, but the portions are awfully small. I usually go with the burrito bowl and am accustom to having a pretty full bowl, but this location has been light-handed on every occasion. I have started going to other locations or Chipotle, where I never leave hungry."}
{"text":"One of the better Qdoba locations in Charlotte. I still prefer Chipotle, but I mix it up occasionally. Glad to see they have brown rice now. I enjoy the tomatillo salsa."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today to grab some take out. I got a salad with no meat although I do enjoy their chicken and steak. It was really much more delicious than I expected! All the ingredients were extremely fresh and the pico was amazing I am a huge pico de gallo fan and could put theirs on anything. Only thing I don't like is that nothing really comes with chips like they do at moes here you have to purchase them separate. 

Really clean inside and very friendly staff. Wish they had a salsa bar. Lots of parking they are inside a shopping plaza but traffic can be kinda crazy at like all times of the day. Kid friendly and has a patio for outdoor seating when the weather is nice!"}
{"text":"I received a catered meal from here on Mon. night at a talk that I attended.  It contained a chicken burrito, a few chips and pico de gallo, and half a brownie.  While edible, the chicken burrito was nothing special--it contained mostly rice, plus some chicken and the standard black beans.  There were very few veggies, and no extras, included in the burritos.  While I understand that not everyone may want guac, sour cream, cheese, etc. in their burritos, it would be nice to offer a small portion of these as an accompaniment either in each meal, or a larger portion of them with the order for people to apply as they please.  I found the lack of extras especially ironic in light of Qdoba's recent ad campaign about extras not costing extra.

Based on past experience, I believe the quality of this meal is representative of the quality of product at this Qdoba.  I visited with my labmates for lunch a little over a year ago, and recall being similarly underwhelmed by the nachos and quesadilla, both of which are two of my favorite Americanized Mexican foods.  Way back in 2007, when I tried Chipotle and Qdoba for the first time in Fort Collins, CO, I recall preferring Qdoba, because I felt that the product was similar in quality, but I appreciated the greater choice that Qdoba offered (I'm more into nachos and quesadillas than burritos, TBH).  However, based on more recent experience, I feel that the product quality at Qdoba (at least, at this location) has declined.  If they want to remain competitive with the similar business across the street, they need to kick up the product quality a notch.  As it were, they won't be receiving my business again anytime soon."}
{"text":"If you like Chipotle, this is Chipotle. The only thing that separates itself from Chipotle is that \"queso\" (cheese with peppers in it) they offered to put in the burrito. Other than that it's the same exact thing. They just re-labeled a Chipotle. The food is fake mexican like Chipotle, but served by clueless non-english speaking servers. Know what you want, say it loud, and be prepared to point. Don't make special requests. You'll ruin someone's day."}
{"text":"I work right by this qdoba, so when I don't want to drive, I walk here. But EVERY time I go here I'm disappointed. Why do I keep going? I have no idea. The service is terrible, the rice is HARD and the food doesn't even compare to Chipotle :(

Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Received discount flyer in mail for 1/2 off  entree.  So I went after rush hours. Plenty of parking spaces and no wait time. Ordered my 3 adoba chicken tacos with all the topping I wanted (no extra charge for queso,guacamole unlike Chipotle). Was yummy and filled me up. Will be returning to use my BOGO coupon monday. YELP"}
{"text":"What makes Qdoba better than Chipotle?

You can get queso on your burrito.

Seriously, Chipotle, why no queso? That seems pretty standard to me.

Qdoba is just a chain, and it's owned by McDonald's.  Despite both of these issues, their burritos are just awesome! Simply, effing, delicious.  And filling to boot."}
{"text":"I've ate at this location plenty of times and its never let me down. Quick healthy fresh ingredients wrapped up in a burrito. $2 taco Tuesday's is a must."}
{"text":"I could eat Qdoba everyday for the rest of my life! Fresh, great for refueling after a workout, and a healthy alternative. The Naked Burrito is a Game changer for sure! Scratch the tortilla and load up a bowl of all your favorite fillers."}
{"text":"Before I relocated to Charlotte, Chipotle and Baja Fresh had my heart since there were no Qdoba locations in Detroit.  Chipotle still has my heart, just a smaller piece of it... as I am now a die-hard loyalist to the Q!!!  Loves this location because the staff is friendly and the guys are always heavy-handed with the chicken for my quesadillas and queso burrito!  Loves that you can dine out back on the patio porch in the summer and enjoy the breathtaking view of the apartment complex fountain... LOL!   Food is delish, staff is cool, and a (back deck) room with a view... what more could you ask for???"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad time at Qdoba, and I really like this location. This whole shopping center somehow gets to be cool even though it's a crappy strip mall. I like that it has an upstairs and downstairs, and being on a hillside just makes it a little more exciting. This Qdoba has always been clean, and the staff is friendly and helpful.

There's lots of fun stuff for vegetarians, which always helps me out. Everything is always fresh, and it's a nice, bright room to sit and hang out. I had a memorably good lunch here with my mom once, so I have positive associations."}
{"text":"Qdoba started out fairly well but has gone downhill in our opinion.
The portions are unpredictable and more often small.
I would like more information about where their beef and chicken comes from.
The meat is usually cold.
The people behind the counter are distant and uninterested in me being there.  I would just like a smile and some friendliness.   They probably need to pay a little bit more and nurture some happy employees.
The atmosphere is cold and uninviting while the view at this place isn't half bad.
It is very clean so they get a good mark there.
We stopped going here and opting for locations that have hot food, larger servings, nicer environment and friendlier people."}
{"text":"We were craving Qdoba big time tonight and the Q at Park Central is closed so we drove out to find this location. Well, evi-fn-dently this location is in the university which is off limits for punks like us. Even the two mall-cop looking guards had a hard on for making it perfectly clear that we were on private university property. Well sue us for not knowing and breaking the law. We went to Chipotle wishing we had Qdoba. You get a single star just becauae."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Ordered through UberEATS and they completely messed the order up. Nothing in the order said guac yet there's guac on the burrito? The order CLEARLY states no rice or beans yet there they are.... what a joke. Lost our business."}
{"text":"8$ for their chicken rice bowl.  I prefer Chipotle but qdoba does have excellent queso.  I wish Chipotle offered queso also. The rice at Chipotle is better but the rest of the ingredients are equivalent."}
{"text":"Although I'm #teamchipotle , this is my go to spot while studying at the Union. 

The pork is pretty good, the queso is a nice touch, and they don't charge extra for guac. (Can you say hallelujah??) 

What really impresses me about this place, and the true reason I believe it merits 4 stars, is the friendly service. Every time I have visited this location in the past couple years, the staff has been INCREDIBLY kind, helpful, and accommodating."}
{"text":"Yelp is wrong on their hours. They close at 10 and Yelp has their closing time as 11pm."}
{"text":"Fast food mexican.  Burritos and tacos are tasty and a good quick lunch or quality drunk food at the end of the night."}
{"text":"The smothered bold red chili burrito with slow cooked beef was awesome. Friendly staff helped me with the queso choices and sauce on and in burrito. Free guacamole and any extras you like. Free wifi. Never going to the other build your burrito place again. I got to excited and forgot to get a picture. Also easy to eat gluten free.

I came back tonight and got the green smothered burrito."}
{"text":"It is mind blowing how what happened previously with what I have experienced before, this review is the same exact horrible experience!

Again, myself and multiple people from work wanted to order Qdoba, as we have a limited break time, we decided to order online as obviously, you would think that if you order online 20 minutes ahead, you'd think your food will be ready to be picked up when you get there. 

I got to the store, I went straight to the \"Pick-Up Order\" area, and they asked how they can help, I said with a smile \" Hi! I'm picking up a couple online orders\" The two employees looked at each other as if they had no idea what I was talking about.. the lady slowly walked to the register and looked in there for a minute, and finally she found the order, she printed it (SAME BS AS LAST TIME!) 

Now she goes rushing to make the order. Good thing I was keeping an eye on it, JUST LIKE LAST TIME, she messed it up. Online ordering, there's a reason where there's a space for special requests \"such as please put this and that on the side\" which she didn't, and I had to kindly ask that she re-do the order, the other guy employee looked at me as if I was giving them a hard time. UH NO! I am not giving no body a hard time, if the two dumb employees just knew how to do their jobs properly, then I would not have to ask for you to re-do the meal DUE TO MAKING YOUR MISTAKE! 

Unbelievable! GREAT FOOD, RIDICULOUSLY AWFUL SERVICE!

Another thing! TAKE OUT YOUR ONLINE ORDERING IF YOU CANNOT DO WHAT YOU ARE ADVERTISING."}
{"text":"Food is amazing always! But every time myself or my coworkers order here, the staff is actually mean to us. They've made comments about us being weird because we sauces (yes we love sauces!) and also get ridiculously impatient when we are ordering. Today was the 5th or 6th time out company picked up food (today at 11:18am) and my employee came back saying they were mean to her, again.

Not cool, we just want some awesome food. You don't even have to be nice, but you don't have to be mean to people who are ordering!"}
{"text":"Service is fast and friendly, guac and queso are free on your entree. When you order chips or a side, the portions are great for the price"}
{"text":"We perhaps expected to have a similar experience to Chipotle, which wasn't good.  Well, this place and at least this location hit my family's 5 star button.  The burrito, steak quesodilla, and the \"two timer tacos\" (my wife said best tacos she's had in a while) were all delish.  This locations staff were nice with perky personalities too."}
{"text":"This is more of a fast food restaurant for me.  I think it's decent for something quick that will stay with you for awhile."}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone says, Qdoba is the shizzzz! From the lemon zesty rice, to the delicious diablo queso sauce, to the flavorful guacamole, everything is done right! The service is always friendly, quick and on point. 10 times better than Chipotle."}
{"text":"We used to eat at Qdoba in our old town before moving south since it was convenient to pick up to go either on the way to or from our kids' ball games.  The food was always fresh and it was a reasonable price.  We miss it so when we travel and want something fast, we'll hit up Qdoba.  We stopped at this location on our way through town today.

The menu had changed since our last trip to Qdoba.  A little bit more expensive but there weren't a hundred add ons so it wasn't a bad thing.  The food was as it always is but the employees need to keep their drama to themselves.  No one wants to listen to girls whine about other employees while they assemble my burrito or mutter under their breath when they're re-stocking the forks.  Come on girls, your job isn't that hard and this just isn't the place for your teenaged nonsense."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and, contrary to the Henderson location, the service is really good. Fresh, fast, delicious. One difference between Qdoba and Chipotle that I personally have become more attuned to is that Chipotle has pretty responsibly sourced meats while Qdoba does not. (At least, Qdoba does not advertise as such. Chipotle throws it in your face which makes people like me want to support it more.) 

I like this shopping center a lot. Getting to it is kind of a hassle? But parking is plentiful. Qdoba is a yummy little stop here."}
{"text":"Even worse service than normal today. My burrito was all fixed up, and then I waited and waited for someone to ring me up. Then there was a mixup that took three workers to solve. It shouldn't have been difficult. When I was finally finished getting rung up, the woman who was at the cash register, instead of handing me my receipt, held on to it while she turned her attention to the mixup at her side. 

This Qdoba has consistently had really terrible service, and I'm not gonna go here anymore."}
{"text":"Qdoba was kind of an after thought for me.  With Salsaritas and now Chipolte near by, I stopped in to the Qdoba location just because it was convenient as I was going to another business in the same shopping center.  The manager was outgoing and enthusiastic, and recomended the Mexican Gumbo.  I have not looked back since.  I dine there at least once a week now, sometimes more, as this dish is truly addicting.  It is a big bowl with beans, and rice if you desire, a wonderfully spicy tomato sauce base.  I add chicken, pico di gallo, habanero salsa, cheese and top it off with tortilla strips.  It is a healthy, filling meal that is over the top delicious.  I still like Chipolte and Salsaritas, but they don't have anything on Qdoba's Mexican gumbo.  Yum-just yum!"}
{"text":"This place was a life-saver. I had just flown in and got settled into my hotel downtown. By the time I was ready to eat most of the places around were closed or looked terrible. So, I began to drive. I had my GPS, but my adventurous side told me that surely there would be something just around the corner. I was only a few blocks away when I began to think about using \"Lola\" (the GPS). Only then did I realize that if I pulled that thing out I would get mugged for sure. I drove for about 30 more minutes, running stop signs and red-lights hoping to see police. Just when I thought I was about to die I saw some lights and drove straight for them. It was Qdoba!!! No wonder I couldn't find any police...they were all busy ordering burritos. Anyways, I ordered here and food never tasted so good. Not sure if it really was or not, but I was sure glad to be alive!

This is a true story by the way!"}
{"text":"I dunno - yes it's fast food - but at the top of my favorite fast food restaurants.  That's not saying much though, since I tend to hate fast food.  

My favorite part mostly is that there is nutritional information online about their menu items, so I know I can go in and get something yummy and also know I'm not doing too much harm.  And a few of their things - primarily the naked veggie burrito and the mexican gumbo are really good and also not too bad for you.  As long as you don't add too much cheese and sour cream, of course.  

But anyhow...the give free drinks to students with IDs and their food is decent.  I can't complain."}
{"text":"Everyone talks about Chipotle and Moe's and I feel like this place is very underrated. They're by far my favorite out of the two because of their sweet mozzarella cheese and really good salsa!"}
{"text":"Sometimes at 3 in the morning this place is the absolute greatest idea.  But for a regular time, like lunch, it can cause a serious food headache and potential cloudy vision."}
{"text":"They have no personality in this store. The food always taste different than other Qdobas. Usually whatever I order, they have to \"make it\". So I end up waiting. Quite disappointed. Highland heights one is much better. And the staff there is quite friendly"}
{"text":"Had lunch on Saturday. Pleasantly surprised. The girls behind the counter were patient with my indecisiveness. The product was very tasty. I guess the burrito that is the size of a soda can is kind of a trendy thing right now. They did it pretty well. The steak burrito with black beans and salsa verde really hit the spot. They have one of those coke fountains where you can concoct your own drink. Raspberry Ginger ale for me please! I don't think I would ever be brave enough for peach or grape Mello Yello though... My kids devoured their cheese quesadilla like they hadn't eaten for a week!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to have a quick meal of Mexican food.

It's not like going to a full blown Mexican Restaurant, but it's not Taco Bell either.

I recommend the Burrito Bowl with the pork.  Their pork is amazing!

The staff is also ALWAYS friendly!

I'm not sure why the person below said that the queso comes with your food.  It has always been extra.  The queso is also very good!"}
{"text":"Ok so their food is fresh and it does taste good.  Building a burrito doesn't get easier than Qdoba and they have added more queso toppings which while horrible for you, taste pretty darn good.  Where this particular location goes totally wrong is the addition of a drive thru.  My experience in the drive thru was bad enough that I went inside to finish my order.  The outside menu does not flow like the inside, so while you are trying to follow that, the person inside is looking at the way things are organized there.  Total disconnect.  If you have never been in a Qdoba you are at the mercy of someone who does not explain well what the options are.  The next time, fool me once, I went inside to order.  Everything went great until an order came in to the drive thru.  So now my burrito is made, but they don't ring me up because they are busy making the drive thru order in real time as the person orders.  Their burritos were nice and hot while mine sat getting cold.  A valiant effort to make yourselves more accessible Qdoba, but sometimes you are what you are and you should just continue to do it well.  That is why people return."}
{"text":"I am always ready to eat Mexican food specially during lunch so that I can add more protein to my diet. Qdoba is my favorite place for lunch. Most of the time I take out. I like this place because the employee here knows me and he starts making my taco salad the way I like it as soon as I open the door. I ONLY gave 3 star because the manager/owner is always trying to add extra item on your bill with out telling you. It happen to be couple of times so now I have to make sure my bill is correct every time I check out."}
{"text":"I been here few times by now and I have had great experience here so far. It's conveniently located in Berkdale Village.  Employees are good here who greets you with a smile. I have to make sure they don't add any meat in my order since I am vegetarian therefore it requires little more attention on their part to listen to my order and they been good at it. 

My favorite is Mango salad :D"}
{"text":"It's ok. Convenient for me here at work. Nothing to write home about. Staff is friendly and the site has prompt service but the food just tastes a little bland to my liking. I usually get a burrito bowl when I patron establishments like these and this about par for the course."}
{"text":"I love this place as I'm a fan of mexican grills and this place easily contends with Chipotle and Zaba's. The meat is very good and my favorite aspect of the resteraunt is the various choices to pack your bowl. Chipotle, though very good, has barely any toppings for your bowls/burritos. You can be very creative with your bowls at Qdoba- and GUAC IS NOT EXTRA! It's a tad pricey, a steak bowl/burrito and a large drink coming above $10. If you get a Qdoba member card, you rack up points and get a free bowl after 10 purchases. Carlos always helps me and he's a very chill guy who's generous with the scoops of meat- unlike Chipotle. I go here very often and it surprises me that the lines aren't as long as other mexican grills."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this Q'Doba for years as I work next door so maybe I'm biased...but I think it's great. The service/attitude of the staff has improved tremendously and they often remember my order (which I always enjoy). Plus I appreciated being able to get a (mostly) healthy meal for under 10 bucks. You can build your meal to be gluten/dairy/meat free; whatever your belly desires. I rarely eat in but when I do the tables are usually pretty clean. Deducting a star because their guac is not made fresh but shipped frozen; why?!?!?"}
{"text":"Great experience, this crew understand customer service.  Staff was very professional while preparing our meal.  Our table was cleared for is when we had finished our meal."}
{"text":"We visited here with a buy one get one lunch offer. Thank goodness we only paid $9.29 for two to have burrito bowls The food was ok nothing special did not seem very fresh. The girl behind the counter did not seem very happy or friendly. No trays available to help carry your food to your table. I would not recommend going here to my friends. The people working there were not very pleasant it was like pulling teeth to get them to add any food  to your burrito bowl. when I asked for lettuce I only got a few pieces and same with the salsa they wanted me to skip the salsa for some odd reason. Weird experience..."}
{"text":"Best grilled chicken burrito I've ever had plus a kind and helpful staff makes this location very enjoyable. Worth every star!"}
{"text":"If you are expecting chipotle, go find a chipotle.  This has a McDonald's feel, and is dirty.  I got a burrito the shell came right out of the plastic package cold... Cold cold cold, everything was cold... Way more expensive than chipotle and 20% the quality.  I am shocked that this place is compared to them.  I came in here because I was thinking about buying jack n the box stock... Greatly regret not going to chipotle next door."}
{"text":"Went in Christmas eve eve after a visit to my salon. Had ppl coming over soon and needed something quick and good. Well. That was a mistake.
It was pretty empty which was good. But, the girl who \"greeted\" me - and I use that term VERY loosely-  there couldn't have been less enthused about life if she tried. I asked for a tortilla with my veggie bowl. Dear Christ you would have thought I asked her to go to Giant Eagle and get a fresher one. FFS reach 2 feet and heat the damn thing it wont kill you, trust me.  
If there was a contest for least amount of fillings put in a bowl, girlfriend would have won the award, hands down. 
The bowl it self was as sad as this lady's demeanor.
It was no where near full. If I got 4 bits of lettuce I was lucky. Normally I get a good size bowl this time it was child sized.  She was not even paying attention to the amount of food she put in or how. Closed the half assed meal up before I could say wth, shoved it to the young man at the register ( who was very nice) and walked away. Well f**k you too lady.
Yeah gonna pass on Qdoba, especially since Chipotle is now near by."}
{"text":"I usually don't write a review on fast food, but I really like Qdoba and their chips.  I really, really like them.  Everything is fresh and quick.  The best part is we got a free lunch (won by my co-worker) for 10 of us yesterday.  How cool.  I will continue to go there and use the rewards card, too."}
{"text":"*Let me just start by saying I ordered using UberEATS* I have sort of a mixed review because I feel that they are more inclined to not care about your order if they mess up if you order through UberEATS, because of the fact that you're not there in person, so they don't have to deal with you. And I also know how UberEATS works, because I have it at my job. It's not that hard. Also none of this review has anything to do with the delivery itself, cause that'd just be dumb. This is solely about the food and the quality of the food. I specified very clearly about the way that I wanted my order to come, it was very simple. I ordered a salad and wanted it in the crispy tortilla bowl and instead of that it came in a regular bowl. We also ordered a burrito in a wheat tortilla and it came in a regular flour tortilla. We had to just eat what we got even though it's not what we wanted or imagined- and the food quality was even sad. Thrown together and messy. Cafe rio is 100 times better. Honestly, it's not the end of the world, but I've never ordered food from Qdoba before and you know you have certain expectations for a place to at least get your order right...and when the expectations aren't reached for a simple order, you have a crappy experience overall. I really wished that day that I would have ordered and spent my money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Despite being busy as heck on National Burrito Day, the staff was extremely nice and in good spirits. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The staff is super friendly and honestly super helpful. The restaurant is a fast-casual setting. You stand in line and they then make your food in front of you as you tell them what you want. They have great selection of protein as well as toppings. They serve beer but also have the fancy drink machine. The wifi is free so you could easily hang it for a while and eat and maybe get some work done. I got a chicken burrito bowl with chips and a drink. There was almost too much food. I had a small side of pico that was free and super tasty. They also had lines out so I could get a few for my meal. I haven't had a bad experience yet and will continue to come back.

Tasty food. Friendly staff. Bright fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"You might  think \"Hey, it's Qdoba, they are all the same, right?\"  

*This* Qdoba is horrible.  I've noticed it when I've gone here long ago, and others have too.  Something about the staff is just off.  They do not care at all about making a nice experience for customers or keeping their restaurant clean.  I understand that things get crazy late at night on State street, but it's always unkempt here.

Head to Chipotle or Los Gemelos if you've got a craving and you're in the area, or even head towards the Regent location...this Qdoba is not worth it!"}
{"text":"Everything was good, food and service. We will be back soon! I loved my burrito bowl."}
{"text":"Love this place......so much better than \"that other burrito joint\". Love the food, its always tasty and the queso is to die for! Who doesn't love hot melty cheesy nachos? Burritos are also another great choice..try them naked!"}
{"text":"Honestly the worst customer service I have experienced, not only was I hung up on the first time I called to check the status of the order but the second time I called the manager pretended my order was on its way when I waited over an hour for my food and called back a third time after almost two hours he said \"no as ingles, come se dice\". I understand if you're busy and can't make my order but please say so and don't make me jump through all these hoops. I called eatstreet and ended up getting a full refund (which is what you should do if you're ever in this situation)"}
{"text":"Qdoba has changed. The last 2 times I've been here the queso has been runny like soup, and the rice is not nearly cooked enough and is rock hard. Started giving smaller portions on everything. I'll sick to Zabas."}
{"text":"I'm never coming back to this location. The line server I was serviced by was so rude and unapologetic. He didn't wait to finish my order before wrapping it up hastily and sending me away. I had to remind him that I wanted corn, tomatoes, onions, sauce, and guacamole (YES, he didn't even ask nor wait!). He just slapped them into containers and smacked the guacamole on top of the containers. Gross! I am tempted even now to demand a refund because that service was embarassing; there wasn't even anyone else there.. Didn't apologize and charged me the full $8.95 for this mockery he called service. I was so upset, and I never knew qdoba could upset me. Now I know."}
{"text":"I'v been a big fan of qdoba for several years but my interest and loyalty are diminishing. The reason is short and simple: your food has become noticeably overpriced. 

Today I got three tacos and a fountain drink, total including sales tax was $11.34 which to me is too much for the quantity and quality of the food, especially when compared to other choices. 

The food was okay/good but just not much value for the price. I will eventually be back but not as soon as I would if the perceived value was better."}
{"text":"Tried the Drunken yardbird taco, gladiator, and the triple threat. All absolutely delicious, great blend of flavors and fresh!"}
{"text":"Ehh...nothing special, the guacamole tasted funny, service wasn't good either. The employees kept talking amongst themselves and barely paid any attention to me or any other customer. I'm staying with chipotle"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch a couple weeks ago I wasn't pleased with the food or service it was my first time there and nobody really helped explain the menu to me"}
{"text":"awesome service - the AC wasn't working in the restaurant so they gave us two Free Entree coupons, even though it wasn't even warm in the place. Free Kids meals on Sundays and the options are great."}
{"text":"First time coming here and very impressed! It's very well kept and clean! We were greeted when we first walked in the door and the employees were helpful and in good spirits! And then there's the food, which is amazing! Definitely would come here again!"}
{"text":"Good customer service, however every time I go the rice is so over cooked it's actually gross. Didn't think that was possible. If they fixed that it would be a great location"}
{"text":"Although the food here is good, like Chipotle, the amount of food you get is completely dependent on which server you get. The staff before Qdoba shut down last year was very good. Can't say that about the people working there now."}
{"text":"Qdoba is right up the street from where I work, and my coworker is a big fan, so we eat there ever few weeks. I have only had one thing, the naked burrito. Naked simply means no tortilla, so no extra carbs, and you are cutting 330 calories! All the goodies go into a bowl instead. 

You get to pick chicken, steak (both of which are good) and I think they have pork as well, but I have never tried it. Then black or brown beans (I always go with the black). Then you can pile on the rice, veggies, cheese, sour cream, guacamole and multiple different kinds of salsas. The corn salsa  is my favorite, but last visit they had a mango salsa that was excellent. I really hope it is not seasonal bit I bet it is.  

Service has always been great when I have gone, and I have never experienced the employees skimping on things like other reviewers have mentioned. Then again this is the only location I have tried, so perhaps I just don't know what I am supposed to be getting? I am always happy after eating lunch from Qdoba though, so I am a fan."}
{"text":"I love Qdoba's but this location is always skimpy on the food and they are not friendly. Such a bad representation of the good restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I usually go to chipotle but this time I didn't feel like the drive or the line. Besides the food doesn't taste the same. So I ordered several items to get a variety of flavors and I was pleasantly surprised. Quality was good and fresh. This is now my new spot."}
{"text":"They are open for breakfast and accept the Case Card. They did not have chorizo this morning so I was pretty disappointed in my quesadilla. Maybe next time I will try a burrito."}
{"text":"I walk in and it's hotter inside then outside and this is Las Vegas.  TURN ON YOUR AIR CONDITIONING.   The place opened an hour ago and empty and it's DIRTY.   The outside tables look like they haven't been cleaned in a month .  The door is more dirty then the tables . GROSS The staff is not that friendly too.  

Now it's next day and  I'm
Back.  Same discusting front  door and gross outside tables.   Air still not on.  The owners just must not care anymore.   This place  will be out of business soon"}
{"text":"So delicious!  I got the veggie tacos ; so good! Place was busy but line was still quick. Table were kinda messy had to clean off ourselves to sit and eat but it could have been that they couldnt keep up with a friday rush. Very good , will be back!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent. I highly recommend the Ancho Chili Barbecue Burrito, it is bliss. The place is very clean and the service is good too. Good prices... no complaints about this place."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a Mexican food place where you can make your own burrito or taco or whatever, just go to chipotle. You will enjoy it better trust me. While the food isn't terrible, it certainly is memorable either."}
{"text":"I haven't visited this restaurant since my first (and only) visit a few years ago...and now I remember why. We stopped in last weekend at 11:30am and aside from the very UNenthused girls working the line, the chicken is kinda rubbery and for the money, it doesn't seem to be a good a value as Salsarita's or Chipotle. 

The manager there is great but the front line staff is NOT friendly, actually bording on rude. They are also disinterested in how you actually would like your order made. Example: when asked if I wanted queso on my burrito, I asked for 'a little'. She gave me a look and slapped a whole serving spoon sized portion on the burrito. When I asked for very little rice, I got a whoooole lotta rice. The only reason I didn't give it one star is the nice manager, cleanliness and the fact that my son loved his kids' meal."}
{"text":"My usual place when I need a quick bit of Mexican food. This location is close to where I leave and pretty convenient. Their food is good, I don't know much about their entire menu since I tent to get always the same thing when I stop in. Service varies by staff member, some are great and are very helpful.
I've learned over the years what my favorites are and I am usually quick with my order, so it is a fast in an out for me. I like that they have free parking"}
{"text":"I really like that Qdoba made the pick 2 menu...I always love a good quesadilla but I like their naked burrito too. Now I get to have both! I also like that the pick 2 options are smaller so it's a little bit better portion control vs a huge burrito. 
Qdoba is the same principle as other Mexican fast food such as Zaba's or  Chipolate.  Everything is made to order right in front of you.  Quick service.  Decent prices. Get the Qdoba Qcard when you go here.  You'll get a free meal after X-number of purchases. (I can't remember if they base it off of points or number of meals purchases...either way it's a good deal!)
The chips and queso and/or guacamole are always a good addition to a meal!
I used to go there when I lived in South Dakota.  I frequented it when I lived in Carson City.  And I still go to Qdoba in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Bad customer service!!!
Very disappointing experience food is just okay 
But the worst part is their awful customer service will never go back 
Specially after finding out the employee with the bad attitude was the manager"}
{"text":"Downtown Pittsburgh, PA. 
Even though Im not a big fan of Mexican food, I like this concept for business. Cutting down on bread is a great idea using the naked burrito concept. I have been in Qdoba before never ate because it reminded me of a salad and it wasn't what I wanted to eat then. So Mike S. tells me to try it. It was great because I get to add what I like and tasted fine. But I guess you are kind of your own chef here."}
{"text":"Well it's lunch time what better place to eat lunch then some Mexican place the bowl with rice and beans guacamole lettuce tomatoes the chips are off the chain this is a little bit better than Chipotle... still about the same format"}
{"text":"I work close to this Qdoba in Southside Works, so I've been here relatively frequently over the last several years. I really enjoy their queso and tortilla chips, but needless to say, this isn't very healthy to eat often. I usually order a combination of soft and hard tacos which are tasty but very sloppily put together. Overall, it's an OK spot to drop by for lunch every few weeks or so... but not much more than that."}
{"text":"My first visit was a good experience everything was very fresh, and the nachos are amazing.   Will definitely stop back again when I'm in Oakland. One thing that spoiled the mood was the restroom. A nice clean restroom is always worth a STAR.  But I guess you expect that in a college town."}
{"text":"We came in on the 4th of July with a coupon for 'buy one, get one free' burrito. Can't pass that up! Make sure to sign up for their Rewards card. They frequently send out coupons, and when you buy so many burritos... you get one free! We have lucked into that little gem a few times :) 

We are pretty simple, we get the chicken burrito on a whole wheat tortilla, and brown rice. I love the black beans, my husband gets the pinto beans. He asks for about 3 ladles of the hottest salsa they have. Since we take these home, we ask for sour cream on the side so that we can microwave these to make sure they are really hot. 

We have always received great service with a smile here."}
{"text":"This place just opened today, and doesn't even have a phone yet. So tonight things were a bit hectic, but service was good. I got a naked burrito (similar concept to Chipotle's Burrito Bowl) and it was pretty good. I like that Qdoba has more choices for toppings than Chipotle. I think it'll take a few visits for me to fine-tune the ingredients that I order, but Qdoba definitely has promise!"}
{"text":"The counter appearance is disgusting and dirty, all of the items/food buckets look all crusty like and haven't been touched or moved in a few hours at least.

Aside from that. Based on all the options I have tried at any Qdoba, the Ground beef and Queso is your best bet. In my opinion, those are the best flavors they offer; everything else is bland."}
{"text":"After a tiring week I placed a pickup order on the Qdoba web page so I could just hop out of the car, grab my burrito, and be back to my apartment without having to wait in line. That part of the plan went fine, but I arrived home to discover my burrito was severely lacking. 

The draw of Qdoba is that you get free queso and guac. When placing my order I requested both, and requested extra guac since lately you only get a small dollop on once spot in the burrito. I hoped by asking for extra it'd be spread out over the entire burrito. 

I did get some extra guac, but it came in a container on the side. I can work with that. 

The absence of queso - not so much. I double-checked my slip to make sure I hadn't missed clicking the box for it. I hadn't. Without any queso (or cheese, which I skipped in favor of the sauce), about two bites of sour cream and another few of guac, the resulting burrito was flavorless and dry. 

The nature of a burrito discourages opening it up to see if it's right, and due to the assembly sometimes you think you're missing what you ordered until you hit the bottom. I was close to halfway through by the time I gave up hope for the queso, and thus was full and too annoyed/tired to drive back to get the correct thing. Calling takeout places to let them know rarely results in a refund (usually just an offer to be put on a list for a free item next time) so I didn't bother. 

I may return eventually, but I'll be skipping the online ordering."}
{"text":"For awhile we were going here quite a bit because my boyfriend lived nearby and was on a kick of craving steak & queso tacos. The food was often fine and on par with other Qdoba locations, as expected. There are some problems spots, though: 
- The women's bathroom is often in horrifying condition or out of service
- If you need anything after you order like a to-go bag it takes forever to flag someone, especially if there's a line; you more or less have to wait to wait in line or wait until the line disappears because half the time there's only one person working the counter
- Dirty tables and booths; I usually have to wipe down wherever I want to sit myself

The employees are nice but overstretched, which explains why the dining area and bathroom are in disarray by dinner time."}
{"text":"The service was adequate but the meal is probably the worst I've ever had at any Qdoba, and overall pretty terrible even for fast food. 

We stopped in around three on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty dead but there were at least five employees behind the counter. As with any trip to Qdoba, I started at the tortilla press. The guy running it didn't have the bag open all the way, and while pulling out the tortilla ripped it almost in half. He still put it on the warmer and when he pulled it off I must have given him a look because he turned to the person next to him and held it up and asked, \"is this okay?\" The person told him to heat another one instead. He left it on the warmer for about ten seconds. I'm not a Qdoba expert, but that seemed a bit short. From how dry and cracked my tortilla was while trying to eat it, I'm going to guess my hunch was correct.

As I went down the line each person put on the tiniest scoop of ingredients I've ever seen at a burrito place. Now, the end result was a totally reasonable amount of food to consume in one sitting, but that's not why you go to Qdoba and similar establishments. You go to get a burrito that's busting at the seams and that will similarly bust your gut. Since the burrito was a reasonable size I felt too ridiculous asking for more in the same way I shamelessly ask sub shops for more pickles, sometimes repeatedly, if they don't heed my initial \"lots of pickles\" request. Long story short, it was the chintziest burrito I've ever received, culminating with about a tablespoon of guac on my vegetarian burrito (aka the delicious prize you get in place of meat) that the employee spread so thin you could see through it and it didn't even reach the entire length of the rice/beans/etc. 

My boyfriend's burrito was similarly assembled at about half size, and the cup of queso for his chips was similarly only filled about halfway. They also gave him the queso diablo instead of the regular queso he ordered - not pleasant for a man with severe heartburn issues.

We got our order to go and had it back home and unwrapped in under ten minutes, but in that short time the food got cold. My tortilla was dry and rigid, the beans were hard, the rice was crunchy - basically everything seemed undercooked/under-heated to begin with. Yuck.

Qdoba on the whole is a fine chain, but this location is not one I'll likely return to given the choice."}
{"text":"I have been to many Qdoba locations. I actually prefer them over Chipotle or Moe's. This particular location is a mess!! Most locations are efficient and orderly. This was not the case for this location. There were three employees working, 2 of them preparing food and one at the register. The girl that fixed my burrito bowl was snappy with my coworker. The other one had on a neck brace and could barely bend over. She was running around between fixing food, getting more queso and cooking peppers. The guy at the register didn't even care how much money I gave him. My order was $7.80 and he stated, \"just give me $7.\"  I was so ready to get out of there. I just paid for my food (the proper amount) and got out of there. That location needs help!! Hopefully, my food will be okay."}
{"text":"I've had Qdoba a couple of times and am starting to grow a liking for it.  Their burritos come with other toppings that aren't available at Chipotle.  A huge plus is their queso burrito.  They also offer more types of food, such as soups, quesidillas, and nachos, and more meats.

Another added bonus is that they make breakfast burritos in the morning, which is awesome for those early morning classes.  I have to admit that I'm becoming a Qdoba fan with each and every visit."}
{"text":"Normally a Chipotle person, I've been deterred by the recent health concerns and, hankering for something similar, I stopped by Qdoba. While I still prefer Chipotle, it was a better replacement than Moe's (not a favorite of mine). The restaurant was clean, if a bit cold, and gave me a decent serving of every item I requested for my bowl. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I hate this location. They barely ever have the fajita veggies or squash already made and they charge me a different rate EVERY time. It's convenient...but it sucks!"}
{"text":"We used to go to the now-closed location at D.I./Durango alot (before Chipotle was here- the cashier said that that location was closed due to numerous robberies). We came here recently, a couple weekends ago. It was for lunch on a saturday- nice day so we just barely got a table outside. Inside was big/spacious, clean and not too many people eating inside either. The food containers were full. There were several people working there. (No drive-through window.) There was yummy seasoned smelling chicken on the grill which reminded me of El Pollo Loco. They make it right there in front of you- to your liking (beans, salsa, etc.), like Chipotle and Zaba's. Simple menu  (like Chipotle, and prices were around the same too, average price $6-) but no take-out menus available. 

My husband had the burrito and I had the hard corn tacos (you could get soft flour tacos). I think the cost was around $16 (regular price) for the both of us but we had an Entertainment Book coupon so it was half that! It was very good- as good as I remember, a few years back. The flavor of the seasoned chicken was really good. The crunchiness of the corn tacos was fulfilling. I had corn, lettuce, cheese and salsa. Notice I keep making references to Chipotle. I just love Chipotle (been there 3x in a month's time) so it easily edges out Qdoba Mexican Grill; the concepts are similar but not exactly the same, but it still gets high marks."}
{"text":"Its basically the same as Chipotle, but better.  Better for two reasons: the frequent visitor card (chips&salsa for signing up, buy 10 burritos get 1 free) and the queso sauce.

I can't give it 5 stars because they (like chipotle) put rice in the burritos.  It tastes fine, but it's technically wrong."}
{"text":"This place is awful the workers acted bothered that I would patronize their restaurant when it was empty at 6:00pm. The food was awful, your better off going across the street to chipotle."}
{"text":"Haven't explored this shopping center yet so I stopped by looking for a quick lunch. There are quite a few choices over here but I decided on Qdoba since I have never been here before.  Reminds me of a Moe's or Chipotle with the service line and restaurant set up. I decided on a chicken quesadilla and a drink . They asked if I wanted a whole wheat or white/flour tortilla, I had no idea they even made whole wheat tortillas but I don't think I have ever been asked that at Moe's (granted I haven't been in about a year) . I choose the whole wheat one , and added pico inside with the cheese and chicken. Overall it was a pretty good quesadilla , they offer guac and sour cream on the side with lettuce . I will say that it's huge and I was not able to finish it so I guess I got my money's worth! Clean restaurant with quick service by the time I left plenty of people were coming in for lunch
Parking is pretty good , but I noticed the lot started to fill up as the lunch time crowd came in ."}
{"text":"This Qdoba was amazing!  We called ahead to inform them we were bringing 30 members of a team in for a meal and they were ready!  They had our entire group through the line in a matter of minutes and checked in on us making sure we were good and if we needed anything.  Wonderful job!"}
{"text":"Excellent call on
Having a bar, Qdoba!
Come on, Chipotle."}
{"text":"Qdoba is my go to place for lunch! Ever since this place was opened in Union, I have been enjoying their food. I love their Burrito bowls. Their servings are generous and choices are plenty. The Diablo queso is my favorite- it has a great kick to it. My new favorite is their new tortillas loaded soup!! I am so happy that the server introduced me to their new addition. The soup is a bit spicy and has great flavor - I loved my lunch today and became an instant fan of that soup! It's delicious and perfect with all the spices. All the servers are very nice and friendly. They also have a good reward system which helps you earn free meals/chips/drinks as you keep dining here! There are two reasons I prefer Qdoba over Chipotle - first this place serves excellent Mexican food close to my work place and second they don't ever charge EXTRA for Guacamole!!! That itself earns them 5 star!!"}
{"text":"I have had Qdoba in the past, and I always liked it. After going to this particular location, I will definitely be a regular patron! The food, as always, was delicious. I got a lunch pick-two special, and my sister got a salad. The food was great - very fresh, reasonably priced for a fresh-mex place, and very adequately sized. We ate in the restaurant, and twice during our hour-long stay, two associates made rounds to all the tables to make sure all customers were doing alright with their meals/experiences. I highly recommend this location, as their ingredients were of quality caliber and their service was of five-star excellence. I work close by and will definitely be going back again (and telling co-workers to do the same!)."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food here. Straightforward concept like Chipotle and the like. I am a big fan of the nachos here. The three cheese sauce is delicious and has a little spice. I enjoy the salsa here, always seemed fresher than competitors. The burritos are pretty standard, and always consistent. My only real concern is that on veggie nachos or veggie burritos you have to pay more for fajita veggies or rice (only on nachos). Seriously? I am already not getting meat, which means that it is already cheaper to make. Other than that, this place will stay on rotation. 
This Qdoba is always very clean, not really too busy, and the service is typically pretty decent."}
{"text":"Food was okay and pricey! For a cheese quesadilla was over $9 wow!! The  staff you could hardly understand them when they were talking. Dine-in there was no atmosphere"}
{"text":"If you think Mexican food and then think Taco Bell....this might be the spot for you. Admittedly the food is way better then Taco Bell it's still fast food at heart. Cheap...fast...good selection of add ons but nothing you can't find at other chain reateraunts. 

I got three knockout tacos and a bottle of water for less than $13 which is the cost of a small sandwich in NY so it's a good value."}
{"text":"4 stars on location. 
5 stars on the specials and I don't drink yet I appreciate the deal. 
Deals: $5 burrito before 4pm - Mon thru Fri. and $1 neck bottle beers. 

Service = 4 stars as the young man made my soup the way I prefer it. Put everything in 1st then put the broth on top. 
Wifi nearby. 
Patio outdoors. 
Across from good shopping. 
It's a win-win."}
{"text":"I love the soup. 

The loyalty system doesn't hurt but I never acticvate it and I'm a Chipotle girl. 

At least this place is new(er) and always seems to be clean. 

Again, I love love love the soup. Especially in this weather."}
{"text":"I was a diehard Chipotle fan until about 3 months ago when I got the worse food poisoning I have ever experienced. 2 Cipro's later and I started to recover but unfortunately for Chipotle I haven't had the desire to step foot into that place again. 

Since we use to love the Chipotle chain so much my fiancé begged me to try Qdoba and I gotta say folks it just isn't that great.

The chicken at Qdoba is a strange texture and just doesn't taste as flavorful. But their steak is better than Chipotles IMO. 

Would I come back to a Qdoba? Possibly, this particular store was fast and friendly but I just don't know if the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Filling, fresh, and delicious food, with an awesome staff who's very friendly (and at times a bit sassy). 

Never left the store unhappy.  A great place to catch a quick meal, when out and about.  Perfect place to go if you're with people who have dietary restrictions, anything and everything can be easily turned into a vegetarian option. 

Recommend are the chicken gumbo, homemade guacamole, and chicken burrito with brown rice.  All wonderful and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This Qdoba location was one of our go-to lunch spots in downtown. The staff is nice, and efficient enough to get you out of the place faster than you'll assume when you encounter long lines. The space gets packed during lunch, as expected, but the turnover is fast, so tables open up pretty quickly. Like many downtown establishments, the rush will leave the space feeling a bit dirty (but honestly, most Qdoba's I go to aren't winning clean restaurant awards any time soon). 

The burritos aren't anything special, but where Qdoba always got our business is a) the rewards that help you earn free burritos, b) the shorter lines compared to Chipotle, and c) the free guac. Who doesn't love free guac?!?! Oh, and the burrito-only line that opens for lunch isn't a bad idea either!"}
{"text":"There was a time when I ate at this Qdoba nearly every day, but those days are long gone. 

The food is pretty standard, but I got sick of paying $6-7 for a naked burrito with literally nothing but rice, meat, and pico on it every day. I also grew tired of the inconsistency of their meat. Sometimes the chicken would be overcooked and I'd just be crunching on charred bits of chicken, or the pulled pork would be nothing but fatty pieces. I just can't justify leaving lunch smelling like fried tortilla chips for the rest of the day if the food isn't even good.

The service and cleanliness also leaves a lot to be desired. While, yes, I'm typically there during the lunch rush, the quality of both has never impressed when stopping in during the evening, either.

Assuming you can find a bottle with sauce left in it on their messy drink stand, the only saving grace of this Qdoba is that they have Cholula hot sauce. With enough of that on my burrito, I can tough out nearly anything they'll serve up. Too bad I can't douse the staff with it, too, to give them a reason to act as miserable as they do."}
{"text":"This has been my go-to Qdoba for years. Never had a bad experience. Staff are friendly, space is clean and lunches are great."}
{"text":"Qdoba is the best! I eat here regularly and I love all the options they offer. The service is fast and they stack any ingredient you like. My only complaint is that they are sometimes inconsistent with quality and that the veggie bowl costs the same as chicken but that's anywhere. This Mexican Grill chain has 3 more salsa options than Chipotle and no additional charge to guacamole. They also have queso if you are into the dairy. The rewards program is also nice with the 10th burrito being free. Tuesdays are double points for the rewards so that's really nice. The flavors of the food always make me crave more compared with the tired feeling that I get when I have Chipotle. The habenero salsa is my favorite as it adds more body and tartness to the entire bowl. Their Pico always tastes really fresh and the corn is not frozen when served unlike chipotle. My problem with inconsistency comes from the rice because it can be hard or crunchy sometimes and that is not pleasant. Usually the rice is good during the day, I think that when it's been sitting out for a while towards the end of the day this will happen. Overall I prefer this chain over Chipotle and the pricing is reasonable for all the add ons you can get."}
{"text":"It was 10pm on a Sunday night. We'd been unpacking and cleaning and moving all weekend. Our goal had been to cook our first meal together in our new place that night, but, um...you know, the best laid plans... We're ravenous and everything's closed! Qdoba to the rescue. Kind of.

Our burritos, while delicious, were hastily built. In the car ride home, one of the burritos unrolled, split open, spilled grease and hot sauce on the passenger seat. Oh well. Appetite rules and once it was in our tummies, who was to be the wiser? The fajita veggies in the burrito were fresh, the sauce was perfectly spicy, and we didn't go to bed hungry. Goodnight!"}
{"text":"Funny how 48 hours changes everything. I was going to write a review the other day based on how good there tacos were.  We came back today and had a really rude employee who didnt acknowledge us as she was preparing and charging us for the food. We were extremely pleasant to the employee Carmen who decided that she was just going to give us an attitude.  Even after we paid, my wife said thank you 5 times nicely without any response from this employee. Customer service is so important.  CARMEN refused to acknowledge us.  We felt a prejudice vibe from her.  Tried to call the number to voice our complaint but it just went to a private voicemail.  Left a message, no call back. My wife refused to eat her food and it upset her so much. I have never been ignored like this in my life and my wife and I didnt deserve this treatment"}
{"text":"I have always preferred Qdoba over Chipotle anyday. I love their queso & chips. I always get their chicken nachos. This time I decided to get their chicken burrito bowl. I will say I was very pleased. I prefer this over Chipotle simply because they have queso that can be added to anything on the menu. The only reason I am giving them a 4 out of 5 stars is because they only had one server making the meals. This made the service slower. Otherwise, great establishment & reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Gotta love how they ignore you and keep the doors locked nearly 15 minutes after they open."}
{"text":"The Manager, Kayla offered us to come back for a second try and lunch for two on her and the customer service was much more pleasant.  Kayla was there and made sure everything was done correctly and thankfully the 2 rude jokers who were there over the summer are gone!  I am giving 4 stars for Kayla and her professionalism and trying to make things right for us.  I do think they need to focus on the workers at the front (the girl that was there wasn't very pleasant or helpful).  Not a huge fan of the food for the price but this location has great outdoor seating out back. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Qdoba is pretty close to home, but for some reason I never think to go here. They even mail out all kinds of BOGO promos and I always miss out on using them. One evening my husband and I decided this would be a good option for a quick dinner.

The menu has more variety than their competitor's menu. They have much more than burritos and burrito bowls. I wasn't expecting that kind of variety so I'll have to try something more exciting than a burrito bowl next time.

I ordered a Chicken Burrito Bowl. The portion wasn't as big as their competitor, but I actually liked that. If the food is in front of me I'll eat it so the more reasonable portion is actually a good thing for me. I loved the taste and texture of the veggies. The flavors of the bowl overall were pretty good. My husband had a burrito and he really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"New favorite burrito place. Nice staff, amazing food, and portions  are generous. Will definitely be back again. Also try the queso."}
{"text":"Decided to walk to grab some lunch since I live right behind this Qdoba, left my apartment at 10:55 ensuring I would be there after the 11:00 am open time. Got to Qdoba at 11:05, and it hadn't been open yet. There was another lady already waiting before I got there and I could see the lady inside running around getting things ready, I know she saw both of us waiting. They unlocked the doors around 11:12, no acknowledgment to me or the other customer or any apologies on opening late, us having to wait, etc. I wasn't even asked what I wanted to order or anything the lady behind the counter just looked at me and waited for me to say something. She continued to talk to the staff person in back while she did my order. I'm done with this location, the huge lack of customer service is such a turn off. I rather drive a half hour out of my way then come here again."}
{"text":"Wasn't that good.  Other than a minor oversight regarding my order (wrong beans), the flavors just weren't as good as Moe's (for my wife's meal or mine).  Value wasn't as good, didn't come with chips and no salsa bar."}
{"text":"Well, it dissapoints me to see all these negative reviews about Qdoba on here - however, many seem to have to do with coupons, which I have never used here so I have no input on that.

I love Qdoba, I think it is so much better than Chipotle and will always choose Qdoba over it.
Chipotle has a bit more flavor in their meat, especially the Grilled Steak which is what I always get - but I still prefer Qdoba.

I always get the 3 soft tacos with grilled steak and just cheese and sour cream.  I am not a fan of rice and beans, so their burrito's are pretty useless to me.
Last night my boyfriend got the Ancho Chile BBQ Burrito and I only had a bite because he added peppers and other nasties to it - but the meat part was DELICIOUS. The mole sauce was sweet, spicy and smokey - everything you want in a mole sauce.
Since I am boring, it was a bit too spicy for me, but it was still very good. 

My favorite part of Qdoba?  Their chips and queso dip. The chips are thin like I like them and no one else has gotten the lime salt as perfected as they do, the queso is spicy and cheesy without tasting like plastic.  I love it on my tacos too!

The staff is always super nice and seem to actually like their job, which is always a huge plus to me. We generally get it to go, but will eat in every so often when we have somewhere to go afterwards. 

Now I want chips and queso again!"}
{"text":"We are moving out of Las Vegas and one of our Top 10 things we'll miss is Qdoba! The closest one to us where we are moving is 3 hours away. :(
Queso burrito FTW. 
Sign up for their text promotions, you get $6 burrito/drink deals often!"}
{"text":"Avoid this location on Sunday at dinner time!!! Under staffed and loaded with staff attitudes due to no help. They need more help!"}
{"text":"Eh, on the list of burrito places, Qdoba is rock bottom... especially this location.  I don't know who performs the 'chicken cooking' training, but whoever it is must teach the cooks to use 5 gallons of artificial smoke flavor.  Seriously... there's no grilling or smoking involved in the cooking process, but the meat tastes like smoke in solid form.  
Then let's get to the staff.  Now I know most burrito joints employ immigrant workers.  I don't know if this is a budget strategy or if they think that it adds a flare of false authenticity... i don't know.  But it's so frustrating when the workers have no clue what you're saying.  When I say no rice, i get the craziest looks, and sure enough they plop a massive pile of rice on the already carb-infused tortilla wrap.  Before I can even say stop and ask them to start over, my burrito has shot down the 'linea de montaje' (aka assembly line) and already has beans, lettuce, pico, sour cream and 18lbs of shredded cheese piled on it.  So I finally get to the cashier, usually an American college student, and I say that the burrito was made all wrong, and they give me a look like I'm \"that customer.\"  Bump that, vato...."}
{"text":"This Qdoba location is better than most, but it's still Qdoba - it's average.  I enjoy the taco Tuesday deal ($2 tacos), but you have to eat it in the store and can't take it to-go... which I don't understand.  This leads to more drink refills, more staffing, more cleaning... why not deliver the special and let people leave and get out the way?  I don't know, its just a great idea with bad execution i suppose.  Like I said... this place is the definition of average.  
Despite it being average, the food here tastes fresh, but its a little over seasoned and everything is so watery.  The tacos drip, the burrito drips, the salsa is watery..... lots of water.  Mexico would be jealous."}
{"text":"This is the best qdoba I've been to hands down. No wonder there is always a line here. For one, there is quite a lot of seating at this location, not to mention the staffs always keep the tables clean. There are also TVs in this location so you won't miss a second of your favorite games. 

I am more than impressed with the service here. We ordered two beers, the cashier brought out cups for water after we seated. Tell me a qdoba that does that! He was like \"here are cups for water as well in case if you guys want that\". 

I was with my mom, I am in grad school and is definitely over 21. My mom ordered two coronas and he asked to see my ID. I did not have it with me, but my mom assured him that I was over 21. He did not make a big fuss over it. 

The mango salad is excellent, make sure you get it with avocado! It's worth the extra 99 cent!! Makes the whole salad yummier and suicier. 

Oh, does it get better than this location has one of those coke machines that lets you choose a thousand flavors? I uploaded a photo of a guy changing out the cartridge in the machine, check it out. This is also the first qdoba that I know of that has invested in a nice drink machine. 

The only complaint I have is that we ordered beer because we saw that it was cindo de mayo special all weekend for $1 beers. We were not told that imported beers cost more. There was not even a fine print on the advertisement. The guy who was checking us out also did not tell us this.

Oh also, this is the only qdoba I've been to, better yet anywhere I've been to that provides toilet seat cleaner? Hello!! Fancy fancy"}
{"text":"This has been a qdoba i've been going to for at least 7 years. I love how soft they steam the burrito wraps. I officially think that if you are going to get burritos, qdoba might just be better than chipotle. However, chipotle does have the cilantro and lime rice. I also learned that even though it is not written on their menus, you can get the bowl style that chipotle offer at qdoba. Just ask for your burrito in a bowl with the wrap separate they will put it on an aluminum foil for you. Nice location and  i will be back for my next qdoba craving!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Qdoba. I have been since I was in college in Reno and a Qdoba opened up not too far from my apartment. This place was awash with kids from the University all the time. Mainly because it was the first place of its kind to open up in Reno. No one had really experienced this type of fast-food movement before. Reno had Qdoba before it had Chipotle.

Overall I like both Chipotle and Qdoba. There are a few subtle differences, but for the most part is the same style, same food, same way of doing things.

The one thing I enjoy different about Qdoba is the their Queso Burrito, which Chipotle does not have. Basically you get a burrito (or anything I guess) and you can have queso dumped on it. Thus making your somewhat \"healthy\" meal completely and utterly unhealthy (add sour cream for extra fatness, yay!).

This particular location is in a very busy shopping center. Parking is quite limited. The restaurant itself is also on the small side. But, I've never waited long for the food and the employees for the most part are quick and cordial. 

I would give 5 stars, but since being introduced to Chipotle I think I like the Chipotle style just slightly better than Qdoba, unless of course I want queso. Well, then the choice is clear."}
{"text":"Good fresh and fast Mexican food. Trendy vibe. Had the three tacos and it was very filling. My teen had the pulled beef grilled quesadilla and it was also very filling. Not far off the 215/n Stephanie so it's an easy stop on the way to/from airport and a lot better than the regular fast food fare."}
{"text":"If I were to rate the best chain Tex Mex joints in Charlotte, Qdoba would be at the top of my list. It's just so much better than Moe's, Chipotle or Salsaritas.

Their burritos are the best & are filled chock full of good stuff. I especially like the chicken burrito with black beans, pico, guacamole, & sour cream. It really is a large burrito & will fill you up by itself. The taste of the burrito is just so much better here than any of the other chains.

As for this location, they have outdoor seating, which I'm a huge fan of. It can get pretty packed during your lunch hours, but the line moves pretty quickly & your wait shouldn't be too long.

While Qdoba may not serve tortilla chips with their burritos or have a salsa bar, they still win in the taste department amongst the chain Tex Mex joints. I'd suggest several other locally owned joints before this for a burrito lunch, but I'd choose this if just considering chains."}
{"text":"We used QDOBA to cater a teacher appreciation event at a local elementary school. QDOBA did a fantastic job! They were friendly, provided helpful suggestions, arrived on time to set up, brought plenty of extra plates/utensils, etc.  I could not have asked for better service! The food was delicious and the teachers were thrilled. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Mexican food, but I love their chips and queso!"}
{"text":"Busy at lunch.  1 line for Burritos and 1 line for everything else.  You get through the line pretty quickly.  Typical Qdoba.  Choice of steak or chicken.  Decent food for a decent price.  Rice is a little bland.  Steak is spicier than the chicken.  Had a new cashier today that tried to charge us $10+ for 4 tacos with fajita veggies.  

Limited seating inside.  Most people get it to go.  If you show your company badge you get a free drink.  If you join the rewards program you get a free burrito after 10 entrees with Monday being worth double."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how much this location pisses me off to my core!!!  I downloaded the yelp app for the first time just to white this . For one the location never picks up there phone , they also close 30 minutes to a 1 hour early most days and the customer service is the worst .no smiles just attitude the whole time ,like I'm bugging them for giving that business my money. Honestly ,I like the food here just would never want to step foot in this location with those people again ."}
{"text":"I grew up in Denver! (Where Qdoba and Chipotle started) & This location is by far the worst one I have visited, I have been to this location many times. And my luck its get worst every time I go. Im am not the one to be a bad one to review a place but the people that work here are not happy. Sad cause cause if you visit most they are welcoming and are happy to help."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, including the grand opening, and always thought it was pretty meh (for the record, I am a Chipotle fan).
Yesterday as I walked past, I noticed the place was empty, and looked closed . . . ?!?!   
Did they go out of business?  
No signs on the doors . . . who knows?"}
{"text":"I know people that love this place, but I just thought it was okay. There are much better options for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"I drive by the mentor chipotle, and they had a line out the door, so I ended up here. I can see why. The only employee in the place had her kid with her, and at 12:30 pm I was the only customer in the place. Want steak? nope don't have any, guess it's chicken didn't look fresh & queso is extra. Next time I'll wait at chipotle."}
{"text":"My company was recently offered a free catered lunch to try out the catering services they offer at Qdoba.  This was a huge hit with my team. They provided lunch for 10 of us and we could have easily fed more people.   Lunch was delivered timely and the set up was very nice. 
The food was delicious ..and they provided everything needed for the taco bar.  We had chicken ..soft shells and hard shells.  The guacamole was excellent and the chips super fresh and crispy. We had several of their sauces and all were yummy. I would highly recommend that you utilize their services at your next work event or family gathering. Contact Rebekah at 702-545-7255 for Catering events."}
{"text":"The food is 4 star, service is 3 star. But you don't exactly go to a Qdoba for the service. The food is good, fresh tasting and every entree comes with free guacamole!

We like this place because if you're on the Qdoba mailing list you get BOGOs occasionally.  

I would recommend this place if you like chipole or similar type joints. It's classic Americanized Mexican food. 

I like the plain veggie bowls and tacos best. The chicken is mediocre and the steak a short step up from that."}
{"text":"\"Don't make me repeat myself.\"

QDoba made a big change when all the toppings including guacamole and cheese became free and included.  I applaud this change and hope it becomes the case at competing places.  I had to keep asking for more of the toppings.  Back when I had to pay extra for guacamole I got a lot more guacamole, same for the queso.  You can still achieve this but you have to ask twice.

I would have given an extra star or half if I hand't battled to get my toppings.  If it is free I want tons of it.  I am that kind of greedy eater.  This isn't unique to QDoba, I also have to repeat myself at Chipotle.  Think of a reasonable amount of whatever and then double it.  If I ever have to ask a fourth time I usually don't go back to a restaurant. we didn't get to that level.

I really like the queso here but if QDoba's policy for toppings could be infused at Moe's then I would 100% switch to Moe's because I like it better."}
{"text":"Welcome to Qdoba!!!! No Moe's about it. I much prefer this chain if that's what we're in the mood for. The atmosphere is pretty retro-ish... I guess. Just be careful the staff hears your order. I've had a couple of visits where the staff seemed over worked or something and was tired. Perhaps they had a run on a particular item and assumed I was ordering the same.. No No - I don't want the stupid Ranchero Burrito.. I don't care that's what everyone else ordered prior to me. Anyways, the place is relatively clean. I have forgotten what the last health score was, but I didn't see anything that screamed out, \"Get Me Outta Here!!!!\" I think the best part is the amount of different salsas. Still not hot enough? They also provide extra Chalula sauce or Verde Tobasco - the bottles are located next to the drink machine."}
{"text":"It's nowhere near the caliber quality of La Taquiera but if you want super fast, downtown burrito. Qdoba is delicious. I prefer it to chipotle.

The service is pretty good. A few of the people that work there really don't care about your drunk burrito. Most of them are nice. They're much nicer than I would be if I made burritos until 3 am. Ha!

Once I went in and a white college lady  was EXTREMELY aggressively demanding her food of college aged black woman working. I was appalled at how she treated the woman and yelled over her. Once the lady got her food and sat down, I apologized for the other lady's behavior and she said she feels like it happens all the time.... not cool fellow burrito lovers. Be good to people [I was gonna put a heart symbol in but its not allowed :(]"}
{"text":"I really wish Yelp! allowed 1/2 stars because I would give this Qdoba location a solid 3.5 stars. 

This is the best Qdoba Madison has to offer. Of all the times I've dined here, and it has been many, the food has been fast, fresh and correctly made. There is a variety of entrees you can choose from including burritos, nachos,  taco salads and more. I will say they they do skimp on the meat. You have this large burrito that sometimes breaks because they are so full  rice and beans but doesn't include a lot of meat. 

I often get a chicken burrito with white rice, black beans, pico de gallo, corn salsa, cheese, sour cream, lettuce and cheese queso sauce for an additional $1. Their queso is amazing. I REALLY love it. It brings the burrito all together and has a lot of flavor. 

This location in particular sits up on a hill and offers a great view busy of Fitchathery Rd. 

Note: Guacamole is now FREE!!!!!"}
{"text":"We eat here as often as possible because:

1. We have the Qdoba frequent eater card.

2. We love their food.

3. The location is usually convenient to where I'm running errands on any given day.

4. The staff is friendly and they help me with my Spanish.

Having said all that, your \"portion size\" depends on who is fixing your order.

I order the same thing every time and I've gotten a range of barely enough of some fixings to just right on some others. 

Yes, I know it's a matter of personal preference but I've never had to say, \"No, that's too much\" when the employee is adding tortilla strips to my naked burrito."}
{"text":"Do not cater from this location, I ordered for a big event last year and the catering work sheet that was sent had the previous person's information on it (name, address and credit card number). Obviously I did not give the company credit card info on the work sheet but called it in well in advance of our event. The woman who took it called hours before the event to say we had not paid, I had to give the number again, and when the food showed up it was late (office is 5-10 minutes from the store) and not what we ordered. Of course the woman I had been working with said I was wrong so I had to pull up the email to prove what we ordered and they went back to the store to get it while the limited food they brought ran out leaving hungry disgruntled workers. They ended up giving us 20% off and some discount coupons but the event was a disaster."}
{"text":"I love QDOBA! QDOBA is like Chipotle but a million times better! Super fresh ingredients and they actually give you lots of ingredients! I was shocked when I ordered the taco bowl and I actually got more than a sliver of a tomato like other restaurants that I will leave nameless is known to do. Friendly customer service which is also a plus! I will definitely visit another QDOBA in the future!"}
{"text":"Extremely rude management. Drove all the way from Mooresville to use my coupon, when I arrived the manager, Ingrid was extremely rude about not being able to use it. I will NEVER be back here nor should you."}
{"text":"I'm a Chipotle fan but thought I would give Qdoba a try. Bow I can say I tried it but definately going back to Chipotle. The steak bowl I had was bland. The white rice was not fresh or savory. I don't knownif I went on a bad day, but definately not going back. My husband had a steak burrito and unlike me he has had Qdoba at other locations. He even said the food did not have much flavor to it. I will be sticking to Chipotle!"}
{"text":"Skimpy! I've probably been here about 50 times and for the last year or so they have just gotten really cheap, especially with meat and guac. The burritos are all bread and are just empty. 

Every Qdoba I have ever been to except this one is worth the $9 it now costs. However this cheap location is not. Other LV locations are still great, but after my 5th skimpy burrito I have officially given up on this location altogether and won't be back.

Plus the last time I came in the rice was old and crunchy, the meat rubbery, and veggies soft and watery- all like they've been out way too long because of a lack of customers."}
{"text":"MUCH better than the Rainbow location. If you have a choice, come here instead. The other one sucks."}
{"text":"If you want a burrito in this area...go to this Qdoba over Chipotle...especially if you like the queso sauce.  The food is prepared better (although the taste isn't as good), but the effort is much better than Chipotle (at these locations).  The staff is accommodating and they operate fairly good.  I would eat here again and they will get all of my burrito business when I am in University Circle.

All in all...its Qdoba, which is a good thing and it is operating pretty good."}
{"text":"I came in after work for national burrito day and was expecting to wait but there was no one in line. This was a treat along with the free burrito. The service was quick, the staff was friendly. They have lots of options, more than Chipotle, so be prepared. The food was descent and I would try it again."}
{"text":"Qdoba is a healthy alternative compared to some other not so healthy fast food options. For those who aren't familiar, it's the same concept as Chipotle where you can choose from a burrito, tacos or bowl. Pick from white or brown rice, black or pinto beans, and veggies or several types of meat. You then choose your toppings which including salsa, cheese, corn, sour cream, guacamole and more. 


I think it is a little over priced for what you are getting but it's probably comparable to other fast food places nowadays. I like chipotle better personally. This location is fine and just as good as any other. 

My only real complaint is that the bathroom smelled like urine which is just plain gross."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Chipotle fan but one of my best friends is always raving about Qdoba so I told him I would give it a try with an open mind. I went in and the guy behind the counter immediately ignored me when I said I wanted black beans and almost didn't put them in. Then they charged me extra for guac when it was supposed to be included on my vegetarian burrito. When I let them know, they were super rude and fought me on it. After we went back and forth for a minute I got sick of it and just paid the extra money for guac. At this point I was already telling myself I'd never go back there. 

I tried the queso on my burrito because that's what my friend is always raving about. I wasn't a fan. Usually when I get Chipotle burritos I down the entire thing.. I couldn't even choke down half of this one it was pretty nasty. 

The only good thing about this place is they give you a free drink if you show them your college ID. Literally, the only thing. Go to Chipotle instead."}
{"text":"Food is less than favorable, staff was not helpful and would not honor print-out that clearly stated \"no coupon necessary to redeem\" Buy one, get one. Dining room was empty for a reason. No manager available to discuss issue, contacted corporate with a promise return call and assistance with adjusting issue but of course no return call. This is the second occasion with a similiar issue we have experienced with this company. We will definitely not be returning to any Qdoba at any time and for any reason."}
{"text":"Since Qdoba isn't in my city anymore I get extra excited when I see one. I haven't had it in awhile but it's a good as I remember. I got a chicken burrito with green chili queso. So so so delicious!"}
{"text":"Qdoba is my favorite \"fast food\" place to eat.  Hands down, it beats Chipotle, Freebirds, etc.  However, I was a bit disappointed with this Qdoba specifically.  

To me, the food didn't taste as good at this location.  Also, when we were waiting to order, the staff was friendly but seemed unmotivated.  There was a decently long line, and all three employees dropped everything to try to figure out how to use a coupon for one customer.  An entire restaurant of people stood around waiting while three employees stood around the register looking confused.  Other similar behaviors occurred later that suggested the staff didn't understand how to maximize their time to keep the business running smoothly and efficiently."}
{"text":"After eating quarterly catering snack packs for a year this is my first time actually in the facility.  Nice corner spot kattywompus from the movies so there's a variety of parking to be had: parallel, angle, or lot.
Once inside you'll find three styles of seating on two levels and an abundance of indirect natural light from the boulevard coming in through two sets of windows. Getting food is pretty straight forward: pick your package and your protein then white or brown rice and go down the line yes-ing and no-ing to the assorted toppings, fillings, and flavorings. Hard to complain about the food when you got everything you asked for ;-)
Rice is firm, meats are hot, veggies and stuffs look, smell, and taste fresh like they're supposed to too. Chips are chips are chips, don't kid yourself... cookies on the other hand are a treat; not too thick, not too big, not too crunchy - good for with milk if you have milk or ice cream if you don't. Also got a soda-matic to make your beveraging funner: raspberry-CoCola, mellow-peacho, whatever your heart desires."}
{"text":"I know going after 9 is probably not a smart thing to do, but I was hungry. Bad idea. Usually I go to Chipotle but I was closer to this place. Let's just say gross. I got the tacos which first of all seemed like they were sitting in the freezer for an hour as they were ice cold. The chicken was cold as well. Lettuce was wilted too. I have never really been a fan of qdoba and now I know to not go back and I'll just stick to Chipotle. Only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because I went later."}
{"text":"To start with, I'm not so impressed with Qdoba. There are lots of similar sorts of places out there, notably Moe's, with better offerings. Location wise this place is fine. It's great because I can drop off books for sale at The Last Word and come in here to eat while they look them over.

They have everything you'd expect from a place like this. The various salsas, guacs and picos. They've got the usual toppers for your burrito or salad. When you're just craving that Mexican face-smash of flavor these kinds of places are where it's too be found. But the reason I'm giving them only three stars is because of hidden up-charges. Well, I suppose the hidden part is debatable. They tell you outright that pretty much anything delicious you want to add to your burrito is an up-charge. Guacamole, for example, is an extra charge. Go to Moe's, you can put whatever you want on your burrito from their line-up, no extra charge. I think Qdoba might find that they even make more money if they just charge a slightly higher price for everything and let the customer choose what they want on it without having to constantly ask \"Oh wait, does that cost more?\""}
{"text":"You had me at free burrito bowl day...... (4/5/18)

I love this location, I probably grab a burrito bowl at least once a month.

Qdoba offers coupons and deals through their app along with a rewards program.  They publish all of their nutrition which is an added plus.

I get the chicken burrito bowl.  You can add all kinds of amazingly delicious toppings for free to your burrito bowl (including guac and queso) 

They also have one of those fun drink machines that you can pick whatever you want to drink from soda, to Powerade, to fizzy water.

There is a patio out front if the weather is nice.  You can also place catering orders and order from the app easily."}
{"text":"Qdoba is something like a Mexican \"Subway\".  You come in at one end, look at a menu board of choices - mostly consisting of a variety of burrito choices - and place your order.  The primary difference is that no matter what you order off the board, the restaurant operates more like a traditional deli and prices based on what you order, not necessarily what is on the board.

Where a Subway (most fast food places, for that matter) would have particular menu items, at Qdoba you essentially choose what you want and it is priced accordingly - and a number of the items on the menu are simply common configurations of what people may typically order if they put things together on their own.  I think it may be less confusing to some if the menu boards were simplified to reflect this.

As to the food, it's pretty decent.  You get a good-sized helping, and the price isn't out of line with what you would pay at other fast food places.  If you are so inclined, you can eat part of your meal and save the rest for later, which makes it an even better deal.  It certainly isn't authentic Mexican, but it's not bad eats when you're pressed for time."}
{"text":"Lucky enough to have this right beside my apartment! Burritos are on point and always very filling. I am extremely happy with the different queso options each month, that is a great idea. I have read lots of comments about the staff here but I haven't had a bad experience with them yet and I have been going fairly often for quite a while now.

I'm happy with the quality and if you are around Arboretum and are craving a burrito, do it, the ratings here seem unfair I feel."}
{"text":"It was my first time here. It's very similar to Moes or Salsaritas and Chipotle. There are lots of options of food to pick on your plate. I got the steak bowl. It was good. I wasn't a fan of the queso though. Red hot sauce was really good. Staff was nice and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Came for burrito day to get our free chicken burritos. They were busy but it really wasn't that bad. We waited approx 20 mins in line and our food was prepped quickly. Cash out was a breeze and we were able to find a booth to enjoy our food! The grilled chicken is good!"}
{"text":"Two for one Valentines special if you give your gal a kiss! Love it! Great burrito, great service!"}
{"text":"Some Qdobas are better than others... and this one is pretty great. There are some really kind staff that work here and I never feel rushed or brushed off by them. The eating area is always clean . They are generous with portions. Plus, they have a coke freestyle machine which is always a bonus. This is a great place to come for lunch if you work near the Park Road shopping center."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood so we decided to eat at Qdoba for lunch.  I like that Qdoba makes nachos with your chips on the side so they don't get soggy.  We were greeted nicely when we went in.  It took us a moment to order because I was considering a few options, including a quesadilla.  However the nachos won out.  I added chicken at the last minute.  I picked out all of the items that I wanted on my nachos and paid for my meal.  I looked for a table to sit at but the ones that weren't occupied needed wiped off.  I finally wiped on off myself.  I sat down to eat.  I looked down at my nachos and became disappointed.  They had not strained the chicken before putting it in with my toppings and the grease from the chicken had pooled on top of my nachos.  I was hungry so I ate around it.  It was unappealing to look at.  I think if I go back I'll try another dish but I'm definitely in no rush to go back."}
{"text":"Qdoba's food seems to be well received by many. They have a website that lists nutritional info. They aren't bad price wise. Those three things were a definite plus. I really wanted to like Qdoba. It seemed like a place I could get into... until I tried it. 

The Qdoba on E. Town Blvd had just opened and I had never had Qdoba before. I thought it would be a good idea to check it out. 

When I walked in, no one was there. It was about an hour and a half before closing, but still... this should have been my first warning. Nevertheless, I found myself standing in front of a smorgasbord of food ordering a Grilled Veggie Burrito. I watched as the veggies and rice made their way into a huge sticky tortilla, and were then promptly balled up into a \"burrito\". I say \"burrito\" because this thing literally looked balled up, not wrapped... it was weird. 

I sat down to eat this ball-ritto and the first thing I noticed about it was the smell. I haven't a clue on how to describe the smell. All I can say is that it didn't smell like something that should be put in my mouth. This is the second warning that should have clued me in. But, no--I grabbed a fork and proceeded to cut a good size chunk out of the ball-ritto and took a bite. 

I have no idea how you can make rice taste bad, but congratulations Qdoba, you did it. You have successfully created the worst tasting rice... actually, the worst tasting \"food\", I've ever had in my entire life. 

I actually took about 4 more bites of hellacious thing before throwing it away. This is coming from someone who will have less than 1/4 cup of Cheerios left in the box and will not throw it away. I hate throwing perfectly good food away. However, I had no qualms doing so in this instance. This was not perfect, nor good, or really even food for that matter.

Never again, Qdoba. Never again."}
{"text":"It's fast and open late. After a night out on state street this is a perfect place to satisfy your munchies. Pulled pork nachos!!!"}
{"text":"So I popped in for National Burrito Day and yum! They had a promotion where buying a drink got you a free burrito.... What's not to love? They have guac and queso!! I was sad because they ran out of chimichurri and I couldn't get a wheat wrap with the promo, but free is free. They have the free style machine for coke so I got diet cream soda which came out looking like sprite but was definitely cream soda and delicious. The only con I have is the way they wrap their burritos, makes it unevenly distributed so all my chicken was at the end of my burrito. But over all the taste was great!"}
{"text":"So much better then chipotle, food is fresh and has great flavors. They have an awesome selection of queso sauces."}
{"text":"We used this location to cater a work party for Cinco de Mayo.  David, the manager, was so nice and very helpful.  We had the catering for 60 people and there was more than enough food.  We had the food delivered and the 2 people that came were friendly and helpful.  The food was good.  We received a lot of compliments from the attendees that they enjoyed the selections.  We will definitely use them again for other parties and we hope to make the Cinco de Mayo an annual event!"}
{"text":"1 star - So I come back here several months later to give it another go and well the 1 star continues....The guy serving must like pretty girls. The woman in front and behind me got very generous portions. The guy behind her and I got about 1/4 - 1/3 less. The funny thing is I didnt even make the comment. The woman who was with me laughed and made the comment. 


1 star -This Qdoba has gone down hill. They have cut the portion size down per bowl by about 30-40% but the price hasnt changed. This happened about 9 months ago. I thought it could be a one off but several times later still smaller portions. 1/3 to 1/2 a cup of meat in a burrito bowl is ridiculous. Also a nacho bowl with half a spoon of queso is pretty dismal.  After 15years of Qdoba, time to go to the competitor over the road."}
{"text":"Wow been to Qdoba for 15 years  and just got a portion just enough to feed a 6 year old, complained to the manager and he gave me more but didn't really give a crap. I have been to this Qdoba 100+ times and they just lost all of my business. Chipoltte is 2 blocks away....does the owner read these?"}
{"text":"I had very limited choices here in this plaza when my friend wanted to stop at El Pollo Loco (which I won't eat). It was that, Subway or Qdoba. 

Having had good experiences with Qdoba in Seattle/Bellevue, I figured I'd just give it a try. (I'm not much of a fan of Subway either, tbh.) 

I went in, walked up to the counter and waited... and waited more... About 5 minutes passed and I still haven't been served because the annoying employee is having social time with either a friend or obnoxious customer over at the register, babbling on and on about how he's in school and blahblahblah. 'Scuze me? A little service down here?

Of course, after a few minutes I gave the employee the patented Condi Rice \"stink-eye\", and I'm glad I did, because this place has a big ol' B grade for their health department grade. Ew.

I did an about face and walked right out, wishing the next guy in line luck with actually getting some service. 

I'd give 0 if I could, but +1 stars because the ignorant, incompetent employee's behavior caused me to notice the B grade, and realize that I probably don't want to be eating at this location."}
{"text":"Oh dear Lord, what an experience...

Problem number one is the front line staff does not speak English even to an 'average' level.  I placed a very simple order (even pointing to the item on the menu) and it turned into a rendition of Who's On First.

After some discussion a second employee stepped in (he was wearing a polo, so I am assuming he is leadership) and the problem did not resolve.  Eventually, my food was complete, relatively close to what I ordered and I paid the rather large bill for 2 adults.  The front end/ordering experience was absolutely horrible to the point that I would really avoid this business going forward and find a different Qdoba.

Now for the food: I had steak tacos and the 3-cheese nachos.  Excellent.  Great flavor, savory, tender, all around good.  Good seasoning, perfectly cooked.  If I had even adequate service they would not get less than 4 stars.

Unfortunately, they tarred and feathered me prior to the food experience so I probably won't be back (to this location)."}
{"text":"I always come in here hoping for a better experience than the last, but they always disappoint. Yes the food is good but the service is terrible. The staff is never friendly and they make you feel like you are bothering THEM by ordering a meal. I've never had a positive friendly experience in this location, which is sad, because that's what keeps me away."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week and never thought to write a review for it. Its pretty much the fastest good food you can get in the area. I normally go to Giant Eagle and get groceries and then run in and get a burrito right afterwards. Takes all of 2 minutes since there is never a line. The fajita vegetables have chipotle dominated. I'm super happy with this location and I've always had a good interaction with the employees."}
{"text":"This shouldn't be the place you visit if you are trying to eat healthy. Sure, they have healthy options, but who is really going to a place that serves up burritos big enough to kill someone with and tries to eat healthy? You come here for a quick, dirty, and delicious burrito the size of your head. 

If I haven't made it clear already these burritos are huge. Qdoba's specialty is their queso burritos that are made with their special queso sauce. And let me tell you, their queso burritos are a work of guilty pleasure art. You have your options of meat (Chicken or steak), typical mexican burrito toppings (pinto beans, black beans, mexican rice, white rice, sour cream, etc.), and my favorite topping, shredded cheese. A cheese sauce burrito with an option to add shredded cheese to it? Oh that's right, they went there and it is delicious. 

Their burritos are a bit more expensive than their competitors (coming in close to $10 with the additional charge for guacamole), but after you have eaten one, the fat kid in you will tend to forget the price difference. Qdoba's burritos are not for the the health conscious or the light eaters. But if you're itching for a burrito fix Qdoba has the answer."}
{"text":"I'm really a huge fan of Qdoba but man this place was depressing. Went for lunch, my coworkers usually like Chipotle. So i figured why not show them Qdoba. But man was I embarrassed, we went in at 12:15pm and it was completely empty. The food didn't look fresh nor did the restaurant look clean. Will not be coming back to this Qdoba."}
{"text":"Warning for anyone paying with a credit card here - be sure to ask for your receipt.  The grown man working his minimum wage job here likes to give himself a tip and not hand you your receipt.  I guess the bum really needs it."}
{"text":"I have a secret love affair going on with Qdoba. I'm a weirdo though, and I seriously only get rice, beans, sour cream and cheese on a whole wheat tortilla. But, Qdoba still loves me despite my oddities. I fork over my cash, which can be pretty steep for what I'm getting, but I do it anyways because that rice has magic delicious dust in it or something. So much so that I'm writing a giant runon sentence over it. YUM. I always go later in the day, so there is no line, and the staff have all been very courteous to me. I think they may have switched to new people since the last reviews were posted, and I cannot attest to the chicken. But I'll go there as often as I'm in the area. I could literally eat there every day. EVERY DAY."}
{"text":"Loud environment. Employees weren't talking loud enough to hear them so the ordering process was hard. Their was trash on the floor where the servers were standing to prepare orders. Drink machine was empty. Minimal customers in the store so no excuse for things not to be cleaned and filled, ecspecially with 4 guys on the line, and one walking around goofing off with teens walking in the door. A female employee came out from the back and had to ask the male employees to do their job of stocking. Food was good. But only 3 stars due to all other factors."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service leaves much to be desired. The employees seemed disinterested.  
Love the naked burrito healthier alternative."}
{"text":"I ordered the 3 crispy vegetarian tacos with guac and chips. The food is delcious and the customer service was on point.  i wish they had a better drink selection like some type of natural juice or something."}
{"text":"The tastiness is on par with the Chipotle across the street, but the quality of ingredients seemed dubious to me. The ingredients seemed like they had been sitting out for a while as opposed to the other Tex-Mex and Mexican places in the area. (I suspect this is a result of having a lower customer flow). 

I was also suspicious of the quality of meat. The meat was sitting in plastic bags which leads me to believe that they were prepackaged; to say the least, it wasn't the most appetizing presentation.

Lastly, one of the employees made us feel uncomfortable with inappropriate remarks. The management needs to make sure that employees are behaving professionally."}
{"text":"Like I said earlier, they always run out of peppers. The biggest problem I faced on my recent visit was the manager telling one of the workers to give me burned bits/scraps of what was left of the peppers instead of giving me the option to wait. Not cool."}
{"text":"So this evening I stopped in to get the same thing I always get at Qdoba, the steak burrito bowl. However prior to placing my order this time I asked the young man behind the counter would it be an issue breaking $100 bill because that was all I had. He then yelled down to a young girl asking her whether or not they could break a $100 bill. She then rolled her eyes and walked down to the cash register to see if this was possible. So I told the young man \"There was no reason for her to roll her eyes. It is not that serious.\" She then proceeded to rush to the back, and then about 30 seconds later came out and told him that they could break it. So he starts making my burrito bowl and barely puts any rice in it so I have to ask him to add more (as I ALWAYS do whenever I go there). Then to top off the bowl I asked him to add guacamole and he sloppily added a small portion. I ask him to add more and he literally gave me a teeny sloppy dab as well. Everytime I go to that Qdoba location it's an issue with how they make my burrito bowl. They are extremely stingy with the contents of the bowl. I mean if I'm paying 10-12 bucks for a bowl, I want it how I want it. As far as cleanliness the restaurant is always spotless. I just feel the customer service could definitely use some work."}
{"text":"Founded in 1993, Chipotle Mexican Grill has expanded from a 16-restaurant venture to a 1500+ adventure. While they don't necessarily offer the best or most authentic burrito experience, the fast-casual franchise features efforts in organic ingredients, a secret menu, an excited staff, great branding, and a customer base featuring all types of social groups--stoners to businessmen to even sorority girls admitting guilty pleasures.

And then there's Qdoba, abused for its free queso coupons and appreciated as a solid alternative when the lines are too long at its competitor. I felt like ordering my burrito was a chore for the person at the counter. I felt rushed through my order even though I was the only customer in line. No one smiled. The black beans were runny. Having queso and tortilla strips are a solid addition to the buffet of choices, but at the end of the day, something isn't being done right at this location...at least the Oakland spot has a bar upstairs."}
{"text":"let me start by saying im a huge fan of chipotle. 

ive gone to qdoba once a few years ago and cant remember if i liked it or not (then again, i never went back so there must be a reason). after the wrangles game, we were hungry and had no idea what to eat. we notcied qdoba was still open (it was around 9:55 or so and it seemed capriotti's closed way earlier than 10pm). we walked in, and ordered. they made our food, and bagged it up. 

i got the choose 2 option, with tacos and the tortilla soup. quite yummy! and the bf ordered a steak burrito. the guy who made our food made some awesome suggestions - chicken in the soup and queso sauce on his burrito.

we got home, and i guess the vegas weather totally chilled our food :/ but it was still good!"}
{"text":"I love quick burrito places, and Chipotle tends to top the list.  But Qdoba comes a close second for one reason: Queso Sauce!  It's spicy and goes great in burritos or on nachos.  No other place carries it good as here.  I know, I know ... calorie killer!  But killer taste, man.  Sign up for their Qdoba card and you get a free Welcome Chips and Salsa, then every tenth burrito is free.  They email me $5 entree & drink combo coupons all the time, sometimes even Buy One Get One and I get to treat my coworker to free lunch.  The staff has always been nice, and I like that they're open late (10pm)."}
{"text":"This is the first time that I have eaten here. I went at lunchtime and there were about 10-15 others in the restaurant. It seemed clean and tidy and plenty of seating for customers. I walked up and the friendly guy behind the counter asked me for my order. I was unsure of my options and he was quick to help me select a steak burrito bowl with all kinds of toppings. As we walked along the counter, he kept asking me if I wanted more stuff to put in my bowl. I wasn't sure if there was an extra charge for any of it (and still don't). I got to the register and it was almost $9 for a full bowl (pretty heavy). He said that I could get a side of chips or a tortilla on the side. I went with chips. It was pretty tasty and the veggies smelled and tasted fresh. I have a second meal in the bowl when I finished eating. Leftovers are a good thing to have. So, for $9, I got 2 meals. I'll be back. Their buffalo queso is pretty good (not too spicy)."}
{"text":"The food quality is always amazing, now that they brought the Queso dip back. Only complaint is... Where did the music go?! It is very awkward eating there with no music or tv."}
{"text":"Dankest place like this. Chipotle and moes having nothing on qdobas. I love there seasoning and portion size."}
{"text":"The queso burrito is great, depite MEHAN MOHAN's opinion."}
{"text":"Store is clean and the employees friendly. The food is always good here but I only get the fajita ranchera burrito, so take that for what it's worth.  

Make sure you get the qdoba card so you can get a free meal every so often."}
{"text":"My children LOVE coming here for lunch. The employees are always nice and patient.
The food is always fresh and obviously exactly how I like it."}
{"text":"We were STARVING on Good Friday and were really struggling to find something to eat that was meatless for her.  Didn't want fried fish and pasta was a long, sit down process that we didn't even want to deal with especially after being out and about, running errands, we really needed something in our blow hole and fast.

So as we drove down Wilson Mills, I was really debating Chinese vs. Cheese Pizza when I spotted Qdoba.  I thought that might be perfect since they could probably can stuff enough meatless objects in a tortilla and make it taste really good.  We absolutely loved our meals!!  Fresh ingredients, great flavors, super filling, exactly what we needed.  Alison went with the Qdoba bowl (meatless) and I went with the Queso Burrito, YUMM!  I am now in love with that 3 cheese sauce, its soooooo good.  Great job Qdoba!!

Out of the 3 MYOB places: Qdoba, Chili Peppers, and Chipotle, I have to say that Qdoba may have caught up to Chipotle but still lacks in local appeal to Chili Peppers in Euclid and Downtown.  I really need to get my burrito on more often.  Absolutely love it."}
{"text":"Queso & guac included in the price ?! Can't beat that the food is always warm and I honestly like it better than other similar restaurants."}
{"text":"Ate here today with my family. The staff was very friendly, restaurant was clean and food was great. I ordered a salad with shredded pork and the spicy cheese sause was yum!  My husband ordered a burrito and was also very happy. We will return."}
{"text":"I've gone back and forth with which I prefer more, QDOBA, Chipotle, QDOBA, Chipotle, some region-specific equivalent of one of these...

Well, this specific QDOBA freaked me out last time I went in. It was around 8 pm on a Tuesday so not too weird of a time to stop by. I was the only customer in the restaurant, and nothing on the line looked fresh. I take this as partly my fault that I wanted to try their shrimp bowl when I should've just gotten veggies after sensing how old these shrimp might be from the look of the other ingredients. The shrimp came from some saran wrapped metal container near the grill. I had no idea when these were cooked and how long they were stored at room temp.

Also, being a smaller female, I felt a little creeped out by myself in this location. The guy at the grill and the guy at the line were looking at me, laughing, and speaking in Spanish in front of me and it kind of gave me weird vibes. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt when it comes to scenarios like this, but something gave me an off feeling.

When I got home to eat, everything was just OK. I won't be back to this specific QDOBA location."}
{"text":"Ate here-was told I was not allowed to order a kids bowl for my child (who is 9) by victor. Would give 0 stars if possible."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken burrito they only gave a little topping 1small scoop of ride and 1 small scoop of chicken when asked for more just half a scoop. The burrito had no flavor and this location is very light on the toppings I will not be going back"}
{"text":"Went to Qdoba on Settlers ridge ordered habanero brisket bowl wanted peppers it was empty instead of getting another pan the guy scraped the few little scraps out of the bottom and put them on my bowl can't even see them.  That's a shame when they charge $9.00 for a bowl"}
{"text":"Food was good. I liked the fact that guacamole is not an additional cost. I really liked the mango salsa with some additional lime wedges squeezed over it. 

I'm giving them 3 stars because this was my first time to go their and they were unorganized and took my order before I even got to the selections. I didn't know what they had, so I wanted to see, but they were rushing to stay on top of orders. They were getting people's orders mixed up as well. 

QDOBA has a very similar selection to chipotle, but I still like Moe's selection the best as they have more side choices. My order from best to good is Moe's, QDOBA, then chipotle."}
{"text":"I was craving for spicy food. I ordered Gumbo with pulled pork. The meat is tender and smoky building a nice base for the gumbo."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've eaten at Qdoba. However, I've heard how much they've changed, so I decided to give them a try. I sure am glad I did, it was really good. I asked for staff recommendations and they didn't steer me wrong. The quesadilla was really tasty."}
{"text":"Not the best, not the worst. I ordered the tacos, and I found that they are very stingy with the protein. Not to mention the preparer of the food didn't really seem like she wanted to be there. She didn't seem enthused to be serving me. Now that I mention it, none of the workers there seemed very welcoming that day. The mango salsa is on point and the other menu items look pretty good. I'll be honest, it will only take one more experience like this when it comes to customer service to drive me away from this place. Note that this was my first time there."}
{"text":"One morning I woke up next to a burrito and although I do not know exactly what kind of burrito it was; it most certainly was from Qdoba.  I'm a huge fan of pretty much everything there; nachos, salads, and of course the occasional burrito.  In general Qdoba is tasty, fresh, and predictable and if it wasn't for their late night hours, I don't think I ever would have had to pick rice out of my bed."}
{"text":"its like mexican food sorta maybe. Well more like they saw Taco Bell and were inspired by that.  now take away any flavor that taco bell food might have had and this is whats waiting for you. Its not bad tasting - its just not anything. its as if not one of the people behind the counter ever had mexcian food made by mexicans ever in their lives. But its a clean place with friendly service so we'll give em an extra star."}
{"text":"Usually this place is OK. Don't try to ask any questions, there won't be any meaningful answers. Food is Great. My favorite thing is the diversity of options compared to other mexican places. This location usually is filled with business casual people. And, is completely packed at lunch

Now do not get the Tortilla soup to go. it is $3, comes in an small cup, and leaves the worst taste in your mouth. 

Stick with the burritos."}
{"text":"Coming from someone who generally just likes cheap mexican fast food joints, namely Chipotle, I love Qdoba.

I love the \"craft 2\" deal where you can pick 2 of anything off their menu for $7. The sauce is super spicy, yum! Plus, the people at this location are really nice, they keep it clean, and there are tables outside so you can have lunch al fresco!"}
{"text":"I ordered ground beef tacos and they were really bland.  I really like their chips and queso cheese though.  I prefer Chipotle a lot more. Customer service was just average."}
{"text":"As I've mentioned in other reviews, I try to avoid chains and most especially fast food in favor of locally owned, mom & pop types of establishments for a number of reasons: I like to support the local economy, the small business person, and I have noticed that you usually get more \"heart and soul\" put into your meal from the local proprietor. But Qdoba was the order of the day today and I must say that it wasn't half bad.

I got the burrito bowl which is essentially all the stuff you'd find in a burrito without the tortilla. You get your choice of white or brown rice, black or pinto beans, grilled chicken, ground beef, pulled pork, grilled steak, or shredded beef covered in a sauce, veggies, salsa and cheese. The layout is a bit cramped and the service is assembly line / cafeteria style as you individualize your meal and then pay at the end. The total bill is a little over $8.00; a little more if you get a drink.  I found the servers behind the line to employ brevity in a courteous way while trying to keep people moving through the line.  It's a pretty good system.

My burrito bowl tasted better than I expected. It was warm, flavorfully spicy and everything tasted fresh and good without that \"fast food\" quality. Qdoba is not a bad option if you're hankering for some Mexican zing but in a rush."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that I haven't reviewed this place.  

Wish there was something cool to say about this place, but it's a pretty standard Qdoba.  This is usually my go-to on the weekends when I'm putting in some hours at the office on the weekend.  It's conveniently close to the 5/3rd building, and it's open on the weekends.  There' a bevy of add-on offerings that they let customers get like queso, guacamole, etc.  It costs a little extra for these add-on offerings, which is usually not worth it... unless you're on a hot date.  I mean, you gotta splurge and show her you money to burn.  QUESO TO THE MAX.  I MAKE IT RAIN IN QDOBA.

hmm, so yeah, Qdoba.

dmo out"}
{"text":"Eh it's fine.   Chipotle just seems better - seems fresher and cleaner, etc. 

Dropped by here to pick up lunch around 1pm and it wasn't busy at all which is kinda nice and since they can make it right on the spot, the speed was sweet. Service was solid.

It's random lunch food, what more can I say?

dmo out."}
{"text":"The first and last time I'll visit the 2 girl a working the  closing shift last night had horrible attitudes as if they didn't want to help me. They where out of several items or they where \"put away \" which doesn't make sense why you would put away items when your still open. For the $25 i spent i would have rather went to chipotle!"}
{"text":"It's a good place like Salsaritas or Moe's... I've never personally been a fan of Chipotle, so this place definitely ranks above it!!

Nothing too special that differentiates it from the first two listed above...

But still my go to place if I am in the area or ordering lunch for my staff!"}
{"text":"Similar to concept to Chipotle.. variety of meat to choose from and can get anything from a burrito , quesadillas and tacos.. kinda wished they had a little more salsa to choose from but I do like the fact u can add jalapeños.."}
{"text":"For above fast food mexican food, cant be beat. cheap prices. good quality of food. great taste. I really like the 3-cheese burrito or 3-cheese nachos. Having the choice between black and brown beans is also very good in my opinion. Location is very convenient for me being near my house. And I would absolutely put Qdoba up there with Chipotle quality of food."}
{"text":"Nothing special. This place is right by my work (and we don't have very many lunch options) so I gave it a try despite the not-so-great reviews. I wish I didn't. Now, it wasn't terrible or in-edible but it needs a LOT of work. I ordered the extra extra spicy sauce and my burrito was extremely mild. I don't know if they forgot the sauce or it really isn't spicy? The burrito itself was missing something. The veggies were bland, the meat was bleh, and the actual wheat tortilla was too soft. Almost like it wasn't cooked properly? I would suggest to skip this place at all costs. Eat somewhere better, trust me, there's lots of options."}
{"text":"Ordered two burrito bowls to go , had a hair in my brothers taco bowl.  Got disgusted and threw both the both the bowls away, called and talked to the manager and he was only willing to compensate for only one of the meals.  My question is that since hair did come from one of the menu items, why not compensate for both the meals.  Really disgusted,  please avoid this place.  

The cashier was also rude and overcharged us for our meals."}
{"text":"Qdoba Rewards (free membership) http://www.qdoba.com/rewards

- Chipotle and Qdoba seem identical except for Chipotle using organic/non-GMO ingredients and Qdoba providing free guacamole (Chipotle charges about $2), so I'll say it's a toss up on which I prefer.
- I received a B1G1 Free (buy 1, get 1 free) entree coupon in the mail so gave this place a shot.
- Having signed up for Qdoba Rewards, about once a month I receive a B1G1 Free coupon via e-mail.
- The times I've been to this location, about 10:30 am, lines were short, service was quick, food tasty."}
{"text":"Screw this place

Service: Slow and lazy

Food: watery, bland, cold, disguisting

Who is going here and why? Why is this place still open?

I saved myself from being arrested on assault charges, having almost launched myself over the counter to choke the fat bitch working behind it when she answered, \"I don't know, want to taste it?\" to my asking if a certain product had meat in it. No bitch, if I don't eat meat I don't want to put it in my mouth to double check. You should be aware of what your serving, you'll end up poisoning someone with a food allergy for your ignorance and sheer idiocy.

Someone who was either the manager or had just been working there longer rushed over to save her ass when he saw the shadow of murder upon my face, and kindly took over and answered any questions I had. But really, it was obvious he knew she was a moron, why are they letting people like this work here?"}
{"text":"I like Qdoba's - it's very convenient to my work, and if you get there before the lunch rush, it's a quick, healthy and tasty lunch."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an alternative to Chipotle, here you go. Nothing too special."}
{"text":"Ive never been to a Qdoba before. I've always heard good things about the food. It was a gorgeous day today and thought I'd go for a walk. I walked passed Qdoba and decided to grab lunch. I'm so glad I stopped. The employees were so helpful and courteous. Thank you for damn good food!!

{"text":"Color me unimpressed with this place....

I ate here twice once about a year ago and ordered a chicken burrito it wasnt on special so it ran around 8$ with tax. I promptly went home and made my own because I could do it for so much cheaper and get 4 portions out of it. This time I tried the chicken tacos, my coworker had chicken nachos and her food got a little more love than mine.

When it came to my tacos the guy assembling was rushed so he scrimped on just about everything plus the tortillas are pretty tiny teeny and not warmed or toasted. 

Then theres toppings which arent listed on the menu so I had no idea what i would be charged extra for-- theres a 2 for 6.49 lunch option but my friend said those portions are smaller. 

So 2 stars for service, 1 star for price for quality of food, its basic chain tex mex. Menu is a little limited and price for what you get.

Eh- next time i'll do Chipotle."}
{"text":"I love Qdoba to begin with & hadn't been there in awhile, so my boyfriend & I went for dinner tonight. The manager, Michael, was AMAZING. It was clear that we came at the end of a really busy stream of people, but you couldn't tell from his customer service. We caught him right at the end of another employee's shift, and he was so kind to the young guy as he was leaving which made me smile right off the bat. He treated us like we were the most important people in the world and gave tons of recommendations on good combinations to try and sauces that he liked. After we sat down to eat another line of people showed up and from what we overheard, he treated everyone else with the exact same excellent customer service. After we finished, he asked me how I liked my burrito (shrimp! So good!) and told us to have a great night. Honestly I would go back just because of Michael, even if my food was crap (which it wasn't). Thanks Michael! :)"}
{"text":"This places is delicious better than Chipotle. I would definitely recommend it. They have the best burritos and salsa."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Qdoba and this location is no different. This location is bigger than most I've been to, and the service is excellent.

If I'm in the mood for some delicious pork I come here, if I want some shredded beef I hit up Chipotle. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, filling. Multiple visits and no issues. Always good food, always so happy and full. Prefer them over Chipotle. Gotta get that queso!"}
{"text":"Good food. I like sitting outside since it's completely covered, allowing wind to come through and keep you cool in these hot months."}
{"text":"Serving sizes are large so make sure you are hungry! Customer service is always right on and they let you sample item which for me is a plus. 
I give them a 4 star because I don't have to fight with them to put food in my bowl like I do at Chipotle. Their steak is not very flavorful, which would be my first choice. Instead I get the chicken. The big plus is their rewards program."}
{"text":"This place holds a special place in my heart. It was the first lunch I went out to with a group from work when I started my job (now five years ago), and we still make constant visits. The group working knows us, and welcomes us each time with a smile and usually a much shorter line than that other BYOB (build your own burrito) place on the other side of town.

The nachos are the best deal on the menu. You get some or the delicious chips, lightly salted, with your choice of meat, salsas, and of course the delectable queso that Qdoba features. The price per entree sits at about $6-7, and they're plenty filling. 

While I'd rather this place stay my own burrito paradise, it deserves your business. Get moving for your American Mexican fix."}
{"text":"Prefer QDub over Chipotle. They are a little weak on the meat portion and 'very little' cheese ends up being a mountain full. One of my favorite for fast food tacos."}
{"text":"5 stars ppl! Don't listen to all these nay sayers. I've never had bad service here! Yes the employees are mexican, but isn't that expected when eating where Mexican food is served. And just for the record they speak English just fine! I have been a devoted customer of chipotle 4 years! But qdoba really takes the cake. Sometime chipotle can be hit or miss qdoba is always spot on! I love the veggies they have their guacamole is great. My fiance had a quesadilla which was melt in your mouth good. I love this place. Really really love it. This location atleast. The location on Stephanie is gross but when I tried this location I was pleasantly surprised. Clean establishment. TVs on wall makes me wanna dine in. Love this place."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Qdoba, and I honestly don't plan on coming back anytime soon. The portions were small, the chicken was really fatty, and the food servings were not that big. It feels like it's a lot more expensive for the quality of food that you receive. The staff wasn't very friendly either."}
{"text":"There are some serious management problems at this Qdoba. I live nearby and go here often, but only because I prefer it to the Chipotle next door and get a free drink as a college student. The line will get very long and the staff takes forever compared to Chipotle. Also, I went in once and the person at the counter said nothing the entire time and instead awkwardly pointed at things. The place is always not as clean or put together as Chipotle and I think this particular store suffers because of it. The line for Chipotle is always out the door while here it slows down so much that people leave. Please, hire at least 2 or more people for the rush times!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner, my brother sister and me got the kids 3 cheese nachos they both got the mild queso while I got spicy. They told me the mild had a kick to it while I had the spicy and it hit me by surprise it tasted delicious none the less. My mom also got the 3 cheese nachos and the same as me expect the normal size. Take this in consideration me and my mom can handle spice especially my mom and she thought the spicy queso was spicy. (If you cant handle spice well I don't recommend to get the spicy queso) My dad got the 3 tacos and he liked it a lot. This place I good for families the kid portion is pretty big  just thought I should mention that. Other than that we all thought it was delicious and we will definitely come back to this place again."}
{"text":"I didn't have any coupons which sucks but I guess after reading the other reviews, it doesn't seem to suck anymore. lol 

I thought the food was good, the chicken was more flavorful than Chipotle and service was good. they always get you with the ad ons though, but it's the same at Choptle, your 6.50 burrito hits the 8-10 mark when you add veggies or some side they didnt tell you about. 

Other than that it was good but if you do the math with the ad ons you can go to a decent sit down place for the same price. 

I would return when I need a fix but the hole in the wall places are still my fav."}
{"text":"I love Qudoba. I got there three tacos with chicken. YUMMY! Not very expensive and just good flavor. YUM!"}
{"text":"Not the best location at all. No one in this store listens when you make a point to ask for a small amount of beans on your food. I've tried saying just a little bit, like half a spoon full, etc. and every time they just slop it in there so heavy the burrito is a soggy mess. I don't have this issue at the other location off Matthews township. It's like they don't listen specifically to that part of your order - even when you point it out. Everything else is fine, but that one part is really irritating. It's happened on several occasions."}
{"text":"I gained 15 pounds in 1 year of college because I would eat Qdoba's nachos AT LEAST 2 times a week. Their nachos are just that good. 

Their queso is sooooo goood and tastes amazing with their chicken, beans, rice, and quac. While I prefer Chipotle's chips, Qdoba is so generous and fills a bag to the brim with chips. 

I wish there was a close qdoba location off campus but at the same time, I'm really glad there isn't because it's harder to feed my nacho addiction."}
{"text":"Gross!!! 
I ordered tacos and they were so cold. It was as if they took the tacos out of the fridge. The chicken was not seasoned and the tortilla tasted as if it wasn't warmed."}
{"text":"We went here on Saturday and we won't be back. The food wasn't bad (it's a chain, so there's some consistency) but the restaurant was really dirty. There were no lids on the containers of iced tea, the soda machine was out of coke, and the entire drink area was filthy and cluttered. It just wasn't clean enough to give me confidence that the food prep areas were any better."}
{"text":"Decent food, though they don't put much meat in the burritos.  The front door is left open so The dining room ends up being about 50 degrees in the winter time so it's pretty uncomfortable to sit down to eat."}
{"text":"Chicken nachos with corn salsa... I crave it regularly. It is good and fresh."}
{"text":"i like to double wrap my bean burrito.  but it doesn't taste like mexico.  at all."}
{"text":"The health department needs to come inspect this restaurant ASAP.  Disgusting!  The girl was making a burrito bowl for me and only had one glove on...and somehow when she was adding a topping I requested she managed to touch the food in the bowl with her hand that did not have a glove.  It happened so quick and I think I was so speechless that I paid for the food and left.  But I was so disgusted I ended up throwing it away!  If she did that in front of me then god only knows how the employees handle food in the back. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I LOVE QDOBA!!! The food is great and the customer service is awesome. I don't live in Gastonia but every time I visit for the day I have to eat at Qdoba. The three cheese nachos with chicken are a favorite! My other favorite is just getting the chips and queso to go buy add a scoop of corn salsa in your queso, bomb!!!! They do offer a military discount which is great as well!!! I would recommend QDOBA to anyone wanting a fast meal made your way!!"}
{"text":"Good service. Excellent location. Pretty good (not great) food. Poor seating arrangements (always feel crowded regardless of where you sit). If you haven't been here, worth a shot."}
{"text":"I know, its a chain.  Stick with me, not all chains are created equal.

I hadn't eated at a Qdoba in ages.  4 years, to be exact...and the last time was this location.

Stopped in Friday afternoon for a quick bite before a poker game, and I got the chicken nachos.

YUM.

First of all, service was great, offering samples, very polite...outstanding.

The food was fresh, and delicious. 
Mild chicken, spicy queso (try the bacon queso. Trust me), fresh veg...really good!! 

Its easy comfort food, but it was well prepared for what it was.  

I think I'll try to come back more often..."}
{"text":"I'll preface this by saying I'm a chipotle guy but I have had qdoba at different locations before and having just moved across the street I thought I would give this place a try. I'm usually a very generous grader however this qdoba location is not good. I ordered a bowl with steak I love the fajita veg they didn't have any.. Bright spot was the guy serving me the bowl said he would be happy to make me some which would take about 5 minutes. I went there for quick food I didn't  feel like waiting.. When you see the fajita veg running low cook more Don't just leave the empty container with 4 or 5 strands of vegetables sitting in it. I could see if it was almost closing time and you didn't wanna cook more so if wouldnt go to waste but this was only 645.. So that was a bummer lets keep going I got my extras bring it home and I was thoroughly disappointed the steak tasted like it has been sitting in the container all day (which it probably had) and the rice was super crunchy and undercooked overall not a good experience staff was friendly enough but obviously not on top of the ball will not be back.."}
{"text":"Pretty much what you would expect from a Qdoba. Personally don't enjoy qdoba as much as chipotle, but free Guac and queso, so that's something."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed coming here for lunch meetings. Not just because the food is delicious but because the staff are friendly and efficient. Today, on the weekend, I ordered my food to bring home. Upon arrival at my designated time my food was not ready and the staff was very rude. They went as far to speak negatively about me in Spanish.

Update: Upon arriving home I discovered they got our order wrong. When I returned when the \"manager\" saw me she asked \"why are you back\"."}
{"text":"This Qdoba is in the heart of the University of Pittsburgh and seems to follow the typical college semester schedule. It stays open fulltime from roughly August to April and is closed during the summer break. It has amazing food and typically has a shorter line than Chipotle, which is about a block away. 

They had a student who decided to show off on the roof for some girl a few years back. He jumped from one roof to a lower roof and managed to get wedged between the 2 roofs. Qdoba was forced to close for remodeling after their upstairs dining area wall had to be demolished to get the student out of the gap between the buildings. 

Long story short, the whole restaurant was remodeled a few years back and looks great."}
{"text":"Like Chad says: \"Qdoba is something like a Mexican \"Subway\"\". Good staff and the food is usually fresh off the grill."}
{"text":"Not getting into a debate on who has the Best Burrito, I just like the flavors and the style. I grew up in SF and had Mission Style Burritos. Not saying that this is though. But I prefer these burritos than all the other \"Mexican\" places around Las Vegas. I like the Steamed Tortilla and their 3-Cheese Queso Sauce, if you like Spicy, then try their Diablo Queso.

What's nice about Qdoba is that Add-Ons or Extras are all now part of one set price, which is nice. Because I like for them to add both regular Queso and Diablo Queso, and of course Guacamole.

The amount of food you get in a burrito can keep you full all day. The the taste has been pretty consistent so far, haven't had a bad experience and I've been here several times, well it's the only Qdoba on the SW side of town that I know about.

The staff is Always Friendly and Helpful. The Manager has been here for years and I've not only seen here during the Day shift, but a few times at Night, but I'm usually here during the day since I work close by, but also don't live too far either. She been really nice and friendly. One evening several years back, my family and I were having dinner and there was a fiasco with the New Cook, which started to a fire and started to fill smoke into the restaurant. She apologized several times, and for the safety of my family, decided to cut dinner short, the manager came outside to apologize again,and offered us Free meals the next time we came in, however we never took up the offer, because it had been awhile before we came back, technically since I came back, my wife is not too fond of their food, she picky.

But, as I said, I frequent this place since I work close by. I typically get the burrito with Chicken, White Rice, Pinto Beans, both Queso sauces, Cheese, Sour Cream, Guacamole, maybe Pico and Lettuce, in a Flour Tortilla.

I've tried their other dishes and they were pretty good too, but I like Burritos. They now have the new Custom Coke Soda Fountain Machine. The restaurant has always been clean and tidy. Sometimes parking can be an issue during the lunch rush, so I take lunch at around 11:30 to beat the rush, it's mainly because of the several of other restaurants in that strip mall.

Tip: Complete the Receipt Survey, you get Free Chips and Salsa! The Chips are infused with Lime and Salt and are so tasty and they give you Bag Full of Chips too!"}
{"text":"This is a great way to go and get any day. There are many things to choose from and there is even a kid's menu for the little ones you bring along. We personally love the nachos! It was great and really hit the spot, there is two delicious quesos one mild with a little kick and a spicy that is really for daredevils because it is of the wall spicy if you don't like spicy that much. Also, the tocas are great and there are many different meats to choose from with a great selection of toppings. So if you want to try something new try Qdoba!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING you get your burrito exactly how you want it and the food is always super fresh and the staff is super friendly I'm so glad I found a place like this."}
{"text":"My go to place is Chipotles but frequently go to Qdoba when it's convenient. Today I was unimpressed. The service was great, quick but the brown rice which isn't really brown, just white rice with some spicy coloring was totally undercooked. The first couple of bites o was afraid of losing a filling. This location although convenient, is now far down on my list of go to places. I constantly get emails with coupons to help boost their sales (presumably). Quality control on their food might be a bit more wise."}
{"text":"Stopped by today, it's permanently closed.  All equipment and seating gone.  It's too bad, it was really convenient next to the movie theater"}
{"text":"First time here..... Food is alright. Nothing special. Employees do not pay any attention to what they are supposed to be doing. For example. They asked... What would I like. I said Steak Burrito. Then she asks again... I replied, steak burrito. She grabs the tortilla and then asks me \"What kind of meat do you want?\" 
My wife asked for no cheese on her meal.... They added two kinds of cheese to her meal.... One last thing. If you are going to be incompetent, the least you can do is have a smile on your face.... I am sorry you are not happy with your job. Don't take it out on the customer."}
{"text":"Love the food!  Unfortunately, some of the staff at this location makes your food better then others!"}
{"text":"I've been to Qdoba a few times now and I have to compare it to Moe's and Chipotle mainly because they serve the same menu items.  In order from greatest to least, I like Moe's, Qdoba, and Chipotle.

Qdoba is very similar to Chipotle in its menu offerings and its toppings, but I like the flavor of the meat here better.  Of course, the burritos weigh almost a pound, so make sure you're hungry because this place can feed a horse!

http://www.qdoba.com/"}
{"text":"The service here is very iffy, sometimes it's great, other times, not so much. I do love the queso sauce that they have here."}
{"text":"Great news: Guac is now \"free\".
Except all the prices for all the entrees just went up and you get fewer entree points when you use your card.

This location is nice and clean. The people working the counter could stand to talk a little more audibly....but the food was fine."}
{"text":"Good food and service, but restrooms are disgusting.  It's disappointing that owners place so little value on cleanliness.  Not hair a bad day, but unkept.  A little paint and new fixtures is a minor investment to a better customer experience.  Sorry to say it creeps me out that I ate here."}
{"text":"It's very similar to Chipotle but with more choices, but for the things Chipotle has, I prefer Chipotle.  The flavor of their rice, beans, chicken, and salsa are just better.  If you're going traditional, go Chipotle.  Also, Chipotle doesn't advertise a quesadilla, but if you ask for one, they will make it for you.

However, I'm a sucker for cheese sauce.  I like to dip my cheese sauce in cheese sauce.  So since Qdoba has cheese sauce, they do gain a few points.  You can get said cheese sauce on anything which makes me happy.  I do like Qdoba nachos -- mmmmm cheese sauce."}
{"text":"I used to pick Chipotle over Qdoba, and I still think that that the actual food is a little better at Chipotle**. However, it's not THAT much better. Qdoba has SO MUCH MORE.

1. More choices. Chipotle really focuses on doing one thing well, and they do. It makes sense they were once owned my McDonald's. However, you can get cheese sauce at Qdoba. CHEESE SAUCE people! And BBQ sauce. And this other sauce. And delicious green salsa. Plus, soup and nachos. I like choices. I like the pick two. Variety is fun.

2. They have a rewards program. I've been saying for YEARS that Chipotle owes me serious rewards. When I was preggo, I ate like 5 burritos a week. What did they give me in return? Zilch. Zero. Nada. Nothing. What does Qdoba give you in return? A free entree for every ten you buy! Horray!! With that math, Chipotle owes me about 70 free entrees. Pay up, B*$ch. Oh, right. They won't.

3. If you order a naked burrito, you get free chips. I love free chips. I order naked all the time. Again, Chipotle owes me free chips.

4. Students get free drinks. Guess what? I'm a student. 

5. They have a kids meal. I have a kid! Chipotle actually might beat them on this. They have an adorable kids meal. With mini bag of chips. My daughter LOVES it. However, if we get two tacos at Qdoba, she's pretty happy two.

6. $1.29 Taco Tuesdays.

7. $5 Burrito Fridays.

Need I go on? Good because I ran out of things to say. But I think I've given enough good reasons by now.

**I personally think that Chipotle's chicken has better spices, beans are more flavorful, and rice tastes better with that little cilantro-lime seasoning thing they do. Qdoba has all those ingredients, but they're just not quite as good."}
{"text":"This place would have gotten 4 or 5 stars but it's gone downhill since I first ate there.

I'm a big fan of toastada salads.. I love eating the salad and then dipping the \"bowl\" in a bowl of soup. When I used to order them, I would get a salad and a bowl of tortilla soup.... now - their version of \"bowl of soup\" differs each time I'm here. They put everything in a 4 oz \"bowl\"...and I swear that 4 oz is a cup of soup not a bowl... also, their service has gone  to the birds.. They are borderline rude. 

What's so annoying is... no matter how bad the service experience is --- I  LOVE THEIR FOOD (reminds me of my Oyshi sometimes). I can't really give this place a bad review because each and every time - the food is so awesome.... YES they over charge... YES they change their size standards...but every time --- their food is pretty darn good.

I hate to say it but - I really like it. My work friend swore that the last time we went there would be our last --- but then we finished lunch and then we looked at each other and said, \"so - next week?\""}
{"text":"I go between 3 and 4 stars for Qdoba.  Sometimes service is great; sometimes it stinks.  Sometimes the food is great; sometimes it stinks.  Sensing a theme here?  

If I leave this place alone for a while and come back I enjoy it immensely.  The food is good and fresh, albeit not authentic.  And sometimes you just crave this sort of thing.  I admit that when I'm in the mood for something like this I like Qdoba more than Chipotle.  On my last visit the service was quick and on point and the chicken tacos and three cheese queso hit the spot.  I think I'll give it some time before my next visit so I'll like it just as much!"}
{"text":"Daayyyuuummm this place was gooodddeerr than a b*%ch. food was delicious. Deff would go to this place again. It was quick. Chips were on point as always. But I really like the guacamole. Give me an avocado. Thanks"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken burrito bowl which is typically my favorite. The chicken at this location was disgusting. It tasted burned and old. It ruined the flavor of all the other ingredients. When I asked for sour cream they used a squeeze bottle to put it on and it probably added up to less then a teaspoon of sour cream on my bowl. I always like Qdoba over Chipotle but now I feel like I won't go back."}
{"text":"The service is always quick here... That's one of my favorite things about it... 

I love the Fajita Ranchero burrito and since I've been attempting to eat healthier, I often opt for the bowl instead of tortilla... The nachos are good, but I wouldn't get them to go because they use queso on them...  If you're taking them too far away, you end up with soggy chips... (And we all know how I feel about soggy bread products... Ick.)  

I do think the pricing for the queso is absolutely insane in a truly crazy way... They have it structured in 2, 4 and 6 ounces and the prices start at close to two dollars... That just seems a little steep considering it's the same container you get a side of jalapenos in everywhere else... What is that going to be dippable for?  Like 3 chips?  For all that, just drop a couple extra bucks at the Wal-Mart or Bi-Lo across the street and take the rest of it home... 

**Now serving $1 tacos every night after 7 pm... Does not apply to steak and 6 taco maximum...**"}
{"text":"As fast food goes, I generally avoid it like the plague that it has become, but when our company received an envelope full of two-for-one coupons, with my limited choices for decent and affordable lunches downtown on days that I'd not prepped something at home, Qdoba won me for at least a try, and they became like my fifth in line for something to eat downtown.

These coupons were only good for this one specific location downtown, so this location got us.

I have to say, I wasn't disappointed, and over the course of the next two months, we went through quite a few of these coupons. Almost every time we went in, the place was really busy, but they've divided it into two lines. One for burritos only, and the other for the rest, and it seems to work out rather well for keeping a smooth and timely flow. 

The food itself is pretty good. I mean it IS fast food, so the crew from The Chew won't be standing in line to assess its gourmet goodness, but considering the crap that most conveyor belt fast fooderies crank out, Qdoba actually puts out a decent edible and I dare say even tasty product. I've gotten steak burritos and nachos, and neither have disappointed. They are decent sized, filling, and come with that thing that eludes a lot of fast food factories...flavor. It's not what I'd call cheap, nor is it expensive. For what you get, it's about right. The steak doesn't taste like freeze dried dog food, and the additives like guacamole and cheese are fresh. 

Additionally, the staff at this particular location isn't the usual paper-hatted line-up of minimum wage zombies. Some of them are actually kind of adorable, including the little guy who usually starts you off in the burrito line. A slightly cherubic guy, he's friendly, being the starter of the burrito, with the tortilla, meat and rice/beans, seems to genuinely like his customers, and then he passes you on to the next staff member who will stuff the remainder of goodies into your burrito, and usually, they're just as friendly. 

All in all, this is a nice option for a downtown quick lunch. Decent food, ok prices, pleasant staff, and a quick in-and-out. A chain worth linking with."}
{"text":"This place was super friendly and produced a beautiful burrito that helped on a terrible day waiting at the dmv."}
{"text":"I have always been Team Q'doba, even before Chipotle gave me a mild case of food poisoning.  I dream about their three cheese nachos in my sleep. And the endless amounts of cilantro. 

It saddens me to only give this location 3 stars. I am hoping that after the Oakland Spiderman incident things will be different??? The overall vibe of the place felt a little dingy... but that has been replaced by some fresh new paint since their recent remodel. The only thing that didn't change ... the staff's personalities. Still kinda feels like you're bothering them. I'll definitely say it's not ALL employees, as some are super polite! But others just look like they have NO desire to be there. Ugh. 

Thankfully it hasn't affected the quality of the food though. Seriously, the options seem endless!!! And I can't wait to try their new sauces. I've never been disappointed by their food at any location I've been to."}
{"text":"I like Qdoba, better than Chipotle and I really don't know why.  I'm sure it's exactly the same, give me a burrito from both places and blindfold me and I'll probably end up saying Chipotle is better!  But, really I know why Qdoba is better than Chipotle, have you ever been into a Chipotle, I feel like I'm in an alluminum foil wrapper, the atmosphere, ambience, whatever you want to call it is so OFF, it's uncomfortable to sit in those sharp, uncomfortable, so-called booths...Yup, that must be it, plus Chipotle always seems dirtier, guess it depends on which Chipotle you end up at.  Yea, Qdoba is good, it has to be a, what I like to call, \"qdoba craving\", otherwise I'm not just going to go there."}
{"text":"Love Qdoba but this location is only for students. Totally get that but it'd be nice if it were mentioned somewhere. Wasted an Uber fare for nothing."}
{"text":"Q doba has no limits!  Get as much as you want!  Chipotle doesn't carry any queso sauces of any kind.   Chipotle charges you for guacamole.  You get all the guacamole, FREE at Q doba!  At Chipotle, they give you the standard coke selection, at Q doba, more than 100 kinds of drinks!  There's no ecoli, and no stores closing, like Chipotle.  If you want to trust Chipotle, I wish you luck.  I get better service, more food, free guacamole, 20x the choice of drinks, and no ecoli at Qdoba!  Q doba ROCKS!  I was there for lunch yesterday, and it was perfect as always.  I live at Cornado and Eastern, where there is a chipotle a few hundred yards from my apartment.  I would rather drive to Q doba where they appreciate my business."}
{"text":"Thus was our first visit here. We had a great first impression when we came in. The staff was friendly and helpful.  The food was great. The burritos are enormous. The chips and queso were very good. We will definitely be back here"}
{"text":"The bottom line: this place is a 1 on a binary scale.

Qdoba does well what Chipotle does while giving its diners food borne disease. Plus, Qdoba has queso. 

Being only just out of college, my experience with cheap Mexican food is both varied and rich. To be honest with you, my true love is Tex-Mex, since Austin, Texas is my home, after all. And, while the task of relating this truly epic cuisine hailing from the Lone Star State - the likes of which has produced some of the greatest dishes of all time, namely breakfast tacos and queso - with fast food Mexican outlets is a bit of a stretch, my claim of burrito-authority lays therein. So, thank you for your consideration. 

Getting onto the business at hand, Qdoba is at once deliciously consistent and efficient, the result of a simple menu, friendly, hardworking people, and cheese (shredded, melted, or molten). You walk into a warm welcome from the folks behind the counter whose most magical traits include manifesting your quesadilla dreams IRL. Not all superheros wear capes.

It would be pointless to describe to you a menu which you most likely instinctively know already. (Most are born with such necessary, basic knowledge.) But, I will make a point to say that compared to others in the market, Qdoba has greater selection, more flavorful everything, and, have I mentioned? - queso.

Advice on the non-culinary aspects of your meal is as follows:
Q: What is the appropriate occasion for one to eat at Qdoba?
A: Always.
Q: With whom should one dine at Qdoba?
A: Anyone.
Q: Which steps must one take to prepare for Qdoba (dress, styling, etc.)?
A: Come as you are - no pretenses await, only joyful burritos ready to satisfy all."}
{"text":"Loved the food... but the servers could be more helpful. As a newbie at Qdoba when I asked what the sauces & veggie options were instead of saying spicy and non-spicy cheese sauce and so on he just added it to the bowl without any explanations. a little more helpful servers would been a five star experience."}
{"text":"The guacamole is a little,salty. But the food isn't bad. The staff is also friendly. It's does have a  Small parking lot. But the taco salad is really good."}
{"text":"Great place to eat I love em nicely seasoned meat , great portions and a nice variety to choose from. Their comparably priced like their competitors. The staff is super friendly and conveniently located on the corner of Mayfield and Euclid. Staff is super friendly and helpful with the menu . Compared to their competitors a much better value for your money!"}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a quick bite to eat food is always good and fast service. I drive a bus and get short breaks I never have to worry about slow poke service here . They have a variety of items and their meat is much better then their competitors. The inside is pretty big and holds a lot of people. The workers are very nice and greet you when you enter. Clean inside as well and orderly! Kudos Qdoba"}
{"text":"The service was pretty terrible. Food was average. My office will have qdoba catered and I usually enjoy it, but dinning at this location was a pretty subpar experience. Staff was clearly agitated and not very friendly. Perhaps this was just a blemish at the location. If we are comparing it to chipotle, I would still rank chipotle higher. Service is better and so is the food."}
{"text":"I didn't even get a chance to order any food . It was my first time coming to qdoba. I went in and was unfamiliar with the menu and asked the server if they had bowls like chipotle . He crouched down as if I was a child having his eyes planted on my breast . He said what ? Is that what you want ? Completely rude . There was a Caucasian male behind me I told him to go on ahead and the server (who is African American like me) greeted him with a smile and answered all his questions . I understand completely if you don't like your job trust me we all do , but being rude and disrespectful towards someone who simply wants to enjoy a meal is not RIGHT . Will NEVER GO BACK TO THIS LOCATION . Also you had employees just sitting around doing nothing"}
{"text":"WTF. The burrito was tiny, the tortilla was gummy and it was ALL rice with all the salsa and sour cream only on one side. Awful doesn't even describe it."}
{"text":"Wow!  Yum!  Ok, so I just got out of the hospital and, of course, dying for Mexican food.  I went down the street and decided that Qdoba would be good.  I got the mango salsa on my burrito because it's in season there & thought I'd give a try.  Oh boy!  Yep, I want to jump in a pool of that awesome sauce!  I love it!!! You should bottle that crap up and serve it all year!!"}
{"text":"One of my favs for a quick stop and eat.  You can't go wrong since you build it the way you want it.  

Food is fresh, hot food is hot, and cold food is cold....build as you go.  The only thing negative I have is the volume of meat that is served.  It seems like your dish is mostly beans and rice.  You can ask for more meat, some times they will charge you extra. 

Staff is professional but distant.  They seem disinterested that you are there.  A smile and a few kind words can go a long way.  

The facility is very clean and offers a great view through the huge bay window allowing the feel of spaciousness."}
{"text":"Loving it. It's very similar to chipotle. In fact, in a blind taste test I doubt I would be able to tell the difference.  As a perk, Qudoba gives you a BOGO on your birthday. A huge plus in my book!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of all of the locations. The staff is clean and doesn't seem to mind when I ask them to change gloves due to my allergies. The tortilla soup is excellent as are the veggie options for tacos. Unfortunately, their salsas are all weak and don't taste very good and the chips are just ok. Other than that, it's a good option for vegetarians and better than most of the competition."}
{"text":"I would have given this Qdoba 4 stars because the food,  like all Qdobas, is good enough, fresh and consistent. However, I have given it 3 stars due to the fact that when I went into the bathroom to change my son's diaper there was no changing station.  Seriously? I would understand if this were a fine dining establishment but it's Qdoba.  Kids go to Qdoba all the time, they have a kid's menu for goodness sake.normally I would just put his changing mat on the floor and change hon there but the floor was grimey too, yuck!  At the end of the day it's pretty expected for a fast-food place like Qdoba to have changing facilities for infants. How irritating!"}
{"text":"Came in for my first time and was helped by Ariel! She has to be the best in the industry! She made sure my meal was on point!!!! So amazing I'll be coming back on my lunch breaks and refer a lot of people because she makes bomb burritos! Thank you Ariel! (:"}
{"text":"Food meh. Customer service terrible. I got a vegetarian salad, and asked for the guacamole in the side. The line worker told me she would have to charge me extra for that. I explained her I got a vegetarian, and it comes with guacamole. I just wanted on the side. She insisted on charging me extra. 
Terrible attitude. High expectations, let down."}
{"text":"Nicer employees would be a plus. Went in today at 8:30 pm and all of the chairs were up on tables and they were cleaning as though they were preparing to close. The employees were incredibly rude and informed us that they were out of chicken and queso. This location is a joke and the owners should seriously consider firing the staff because they clearly hate their jobs and provide a completely dismal and unpleasant consumer experience. I will never go to this location again and recommend that you think twice as well. These people seem to care so little it makes we worried about cleanliness and etiquette behind the scenes!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets for a Qdoba. Seriously, it's a Qdoba. It's good and tastes like Qdoba. What are people expecting?"}
{"text":"Oh em gee this is like one of my favorite spots to eat, it's like chipotle but like in another brand kinda Like Burger King and McDonald ( pretty much the same thing ) but ohh loorrt this is soooo good if you wanna eat some good Mexican food go this is the place to go lol"}
{"text":"Qdoba or not to Qdoba - that is the question here!

Looking for decent service and fresh food at a price that will not rock your wallet...then Qdoba is a good place to park yourself at. I have been here a couple of times and the service can be touch and go depending on who waits on you....but what is always good is the food. You can taste how fresh everything is in every bite.

Every time I go there I get the same thing : Mexican gumbo with pork and black beans. This is a definite comfort food. YUM! I have also had the cheese quesadila and the con queso - both were good.

Overall - it's a ok place to stop if you are not looking for top notch service with a smile and just want a bowl of warm gumbo to warm your spirit instead. Qdoba on your on risk."}
{"text":"I know the secret......QUESO!!!  I know why my fiancé LOVES this place!!"}
{"text":"Why am I writing this review? Well, one of my fellow yelp buddy was so persistent that Qdoba is better then Chipotle, that I gave Qdoba a shot again, because a year ago, their foods was kind of bleh to me, so i never went back...until now. Well, since I'm writing this review and giving it a 4 stars, you can obviously guess that I like my experience. Their foods tasted much better, and the service was much better too. Though i would love their steaks to be a bit more seasoned, other than that problemo, they're pretty good. Also the portion they give to you is much bigger than Chipotle, so that is a bonus. So I guess Qdoba is slowing regaining my love again :)"}
{"text":"Terrible service, skimp on the meat.  DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION.  They won't even give you the full spoon of meat.  They treat you like a second tier customer when you try to use the coupon they email you.  

STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION"}
{"text":"I've always been confused if this place is affiliated with the large Qdoba franchise. After trying this place for the first time, I think it is, but not 100% sure. 

I ordered the steak queso burrito and it was mediocre. The steak lacked some flavor and there was not much in the burrito. The queso was good and the corn salsa added some nice flavor to the burrito."}
{"text":"Just got denied service before closing because they just had a rush and they told myself and another customer they would not be serving us."}
{"text":"I am usually a fan of Qdoba. The meal today at this University Rd branch was very disappointing. Service was very slow, they were scrapping bottom of the pan for everything and made too many mistakes on several orders. Zero organization."}
{"text":"This is a great place !! Clean, warm, beautiful. Burritos are just awsome, tacos are delicious 
5 stars cuz you get good food and prices are fair"}
{"text":"I arrived around 10:30 and I was the only one there with my friend, early I know because when I go around noon sometimes it's hard to find a table it's so busy. The food was good,  except the chicken I had in my nachos was really fatty this time,  normally it's really good.   While I was ordering I couldn't hear what the lady was saying to me at all,  the music was so loud that I couldn't hear my friend talking when we sat down either.  I didn't really get what I wanted because she couldn't hear what I was saying yes or no to.   All in all it was ok."}
{"text":"Wow, this place just opened and I'm so impressed.  I tried the Craft 2; got 3 cheese queso with chicken and a quesidilla.  The corn salsa is great and lots of others to choose from.  The staff was friendly and I can't wait to go back.  They have a great rewards program too, so check it out!"}
{"text":"Typical QDoba food in the Madison suburbs.

Went for a late lunch around 1pm on a Monday and definitely avoided the lunch rush.

Grabbed a veggie burrito bowl and added the ancho chile BBQ sauce. Dang! That sauce is good. I swear it would taste good on anything.

Service was quick and mostly helpful. The guy that put the BBQ sauce on didn't seem to know what I was talking about (hard to believe when it's listed on the menu, right?), but otherwise my order went off without a hitch.

Plenty of spots to sit and overall, a clean dining room.

I noticed they have an outdoor seating area that I can't wait to try this summer!"}
{"text":"Food was soo GOOD!! This was my first time eating here & im in love with it they have great customer service everybody was so nice I would definitely recommend my friends & family to go there love it keep up with the good work guys"}
{"text":"We walked in on a Sunday night a little after 7 p.m. The place was basically empty, maybe 2 or 3 other families. Smelled so good. Almost all of the tables were available. Yeah! 

That said, we took one look around and LEFT because the place was so incredibly filthy. Food and general \"shmutz\" covered the empty tables and chunks of food littered the floor. It was as though the place had just hosted a birthday party for 100 unsupervised toddlers. The clincher for me instigating our swift departure was the excess of staff standing around behind the counter ... doing nothing about the state of affairs in the dining room. 

This wasn't a quick \"hey, could you please wipe off a table?\" level of dirty. It was gross staff and managerial neglect. I didn't want food from a kitchen staffed by people who are blind to such a disgusting mess."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Qdoba but their food had no flavor. My husband got a burrito and the red sauce that they \"smothered\" the burrito in was actually quite good and spicy. However, my chicken salad was flavorless. Chipotle somehow manages to get so much flavor in the salads I order and I was very hopefully that this would be similar. Sadly, it wasn't. One star for the burrito flavor and another start for ease of ordering and cleanliness."}
{"text":"I give this location 3 out of 5 stars for the following reasons:

1.  The owner/manager is a fun person, always friendly and comes out and greets you while you are eating, asks how everything is, and at no other Qdoba have I seen this.  This alone would have earned it 4 stars.

2.  The food is 90% of the time delicious (the other 10% only subpar, and never because the food isn't good, but mostly because it's due to going there during their busiest times, meaning the food is thrown together in a rush, that is all), and they do have good options for vegetarians such as myself and my husband (except I do get irritated when they ASSUME we want meat AFTER we tell them we want a vegetarian burrito or a veggie quesodilla).  This alone would have gotten them 3 stars.

3.  The location of this particular Qdoba, quite honestly, sucks.  The parking lot is small, you can only turn out of it one way (almost always the way we DON'T want to be going haha), but there is a back way out.  However, this back way leads to what looks like a one way street (only 1 car can fit, the parking stalls are all slanted one way) but people always try to turn down it when you are trying to make your own way through, causing traffic backups.  All in all, I still go here, but NEVER during the typical lunch hour (so not between noon and 1:30ish) or typical dinner hour (not as bad as the lunch one, though!).  If you do, you probably won't get a parking spot, and you'll either have to park way on the other side on the street and walk there or find somewhere else to eat a quick lunch.  When it isn't packed, this location is quite convenient and has a overall friendly atmosphere. This alone gets the location 2 stars.

All in all, I love this Qdoba more than the rest; the manager I mentioned always recognizes us and goes out of his way to treat us well, but the location needs to be much better."}
{"text":"I've never had  a problem at this location.  All the employees have always been good.  I usually get vegetarian food from here, but today I got a salad with some pork on it.  It was a good salad."}
{"text":"Awww, yeah son.  You in the mood for a burrito?

--Qdoba got your back.

Hey?  Feel like a quesadilla?  

--Guess what?  Qdoba is just waiting for you to roll in and order one.

Got a hankerin' for a taco?

--Qdoba be right there, man. Just hit the turn signal and stop on in.

Need to feel like you're eating Americanized Mexican food in the Antarctic?  

--Qdoba keeps their dining room at subzero temperatures and has metal tables! You will freeze your cajones off, m'man!

Feel like overpaying for your food?  

--Qdoba knew you would!  

Want a soggy burrito because they didn't bother to drain the liquid from the pork?  

--Qdoba does that already, bro!  You're hooked up!



I do like Qdoba, but let's be honest: It's Qdoba.  I'm not there for a miracle. I'm not there for a life-changing experience.  I'm there to get affordable chow to shovel in my gob, and then move on with the rest of my day.  To that end, Qdoba delivers.  They aren't exactly cheap, but they're not going to break you, either.  If you're lucky enough to get a decent server, the food can be downright great, but on the other end of the spectrum, I've had burritos that looked like crime scenes."}
{"text":"i have always had good service and good food here.  the mango mojo is great.  the drink machine is amazing, so many flavors.  The place is clean.  They have free wifi.  You really cant go wrong here."}
{"text":"I guess I was asleep at the wheel while all these burrito joints started popping up everywhere. There are quite a few of these in Charlotte now and if you had asked me a couple of years ago if something like this might have worked, I'd have said \"No Way!\"

It's good to be wrong. Qdoba has the same basic formula as the others. As you move down the assembly line, you're asked if you want a burrito or a \"naked burrito\" (which is just the same stuff in a bowl without the tortilla) or a salad (again, same stuff, but now on top of lettuce). What type of meat (grilled chicken, steak, ground beef), salsa, and other toppings. I really like the grilled chicken which has a little bit of zing and other flavors to it and the corn salsa. The guacamole always tastes fresh, whether it's lunchtime or dinner time.

After the burrito is assembled, grab your drink cup and hit up the soda fountain. I usually go with the sugar free lemonade, which is only 5 calories or so. They also have a small selection of beers.

I can't really say that Qdoba is any better than Chipotle or Salsarita's. They all seem to have the same food and the same formula. Hit the one that's closest to you and enjoy!"}
{"text":"One of the first entrants in the burrito market. Qdoba and these others are sort of like Subway, where you pick how you want it as your \"sandwich\" goes down the assembly line. They have some very innovative ideas for their burritos sauces - I chose the Poblano Pesto chicken burrito. Otherwise, it seems to be very similar to the other chains with chopped beef or chopped chicken. They might also do a pulled pork and veggie burrito.

You don't necessarily have to go with the burrito. They offer salads and nachos and tacos and quesadillas and even soup.

I have to agree with Dave's much earlier review - the cilantro lime rice is really good here but the chips are better at Salsaritas. And going a bit further, the salsa is better at Moe's.

Free wifi and they have a frequent flier club where you can get free stuff after a certain number of visits."}
{"text":"Our family has been coming to this Qdoba for at least 10 years and it's been a slow but steady decline into mediocrity ever since.   Their menu has not \"evolved;\" it's virtually unrecognizable from years ago. I've made attempts to get right with that, because my kids like the queso and chips.  Even that, though, has changed to more of a sauce than cheese. 

The one consistency: a thoroughly disengaged counter staff, never rude, but never pleasant or smiling either.  Maybe it's because I'm older but \"meh\" isn't worth my dollars anymore.  I'm sure the rest of the family will still come by from time to time.  I won't be joining them."}
{"text":"Not very friendly, no flavored tofu for meat substitute, bland guacamole and veggies. Chips are stale, and they didn't have sauces available. Only one opened bottle with dried crusty sauce on it. I won't be returning, I should have gone to chipotle!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better Qdoba's that I've stopped in at. I've never actually eaten inside the restaurant, I've always just taken my food to-go. However, the employees (one in particular) that work the line are always very friendly and asking how my day is going, which is what gives this place such a high rating compared to others. Portions that I've received here have always been acceptable and sometimes over the top. I always go with a delicious burrito bowl. Will definitely be returning when I'm at home."}
{"text":"Chain reviews are something that need to happen. Whether we like it or not we all utilize chains at some point in our lives. 
We come here for the salads which to me are far better than the bowls served at Chipotle. Don't get me wrong I do like that place now and again too. But the portions are much better here and the ingredients are fresher."}
{"text":"Chain restaurant with many locations that has been around long before places like Chipotle. This location is always clean with friendly workers. My constant is the taco salad and I love having it packed with so many veggies including corn."}
{"text":"Okay so I'm not sure how they make it so good, but their queso is amazing! I always order chips and queso from here. They also have the option to put it in your burrito. Everything from their steak burritos and quesadillas are so appetizing. I have never been disappointed here. While I also like Chipotle, they are not the first on my list when I am craving Mexican fare because the \"NEW\" queso they started serving is really disappointing. Qdoba puts them to shame in the queso area. The ingredients they use for all of their meal offerings are great quality and fresh. Keep it up Qdoba and do not change anything when it comes to your queso, it's the best!"}
{"text":"Being a national chain, Qdoba isn't the world's most authentic Mexican fare, but for less than $10, you can get surf and turf in the middle of  uptown Charlotte in less than 10 minutes. That's pretty hard to beat. 

I recommend going with the burrito bowl, telling the server \"Don't be shy\" with the toppings (pro tip: even if you order double meat AND get guacamole, three price only Comes to about $11) and getting the habanero salsa. It's not as spicy as out doings, and gives the mask a pleasant kick. Also sit outside, because it has an outdoor seating area. Good for people watching all the yuppies, lol."}
{"text":"We had a late meeting today and got out at around 8ish. It was waaaaay too late to think about going home and cooking so we decided to try out something more fast foodish that we haven't been to yet. I remembered seeing Qdoba on our many Birkdale shopping extravaganzas so I figured it was the perfect opportunity to check the place out.

Situated on the corner in front of the movie theater, Qdoba is one of the more convenient restaurants to get to since the theater's parking lot is right there. The menu and layout is similar to that of Moe's/Chipolte, in that you basically build your own tacos, burritos, quesidillas, etc. from their Subway-esque setup of fixins.

I went with three hard shell tacos with pulled pork. The pork was a bit flavorless by itself, and I had to go with the green Tabasco sauce to give it some \"umph.\" I also popped some lettuce and corn salsa in there, and it was ok, but not great. 

The miss' had a veggie burrito which was a bit better than mine. She loaded it up with veggies, beans, rice, guac and some other stuff, and those flavors melded together pretty well. 

In the end, Qdoba doesn't have much going for it. If I want tacos in Birkdale, I'm going to Baja Soul. If I want to make my own burrito and I'm not in Birkdale, I'll drive over to Moe's in the Target plaza. I'll always view Qdoba as Moe's little brother who hasn't quite matured yet. Not that I'd be adverse to going back, but there are simply better fast food/counter service Mexican restaurants in the area that are superior to Qdoba."}
{"text":"They have improved sooo much over the past year. Food is great. You can see them constantly grilling your chicken and beef. The cilantro lime rice is delicious. I love the fact that, unlike their competitors, they don't charge you extra for toppings such cheese sauce, guac, sour cream, fajita veggies, or salsa. (fuzzy's and cafe Rio charge extra for everything). They have the best chips and queso. If placed against Chipotle, Fuzzy's, Cafe Rio and Moe's, QDOBA WINS BY A MILE!"}
{"text":"I guess if you've eaten at one Qdoba, perhaps there won't be anything to make you say, whoa this one really takes the cake (or the burrito). 

  But I will give this place big props on flavorful chicken. I ordered the chicken quesadilla. Very flavorful. I ordered the beef burrito to have  for dinner tomorrow and I snuck a bite while it was still warm, I didn't like it as much. Maybe it was because that chicken wowed my buds or maybe I didn't like the queso sauce on the burrito. 

OR you know when you pick up a glass and you think it has sweet tea but it turns out to be water instead so when you sipped it you were expecting one taste but was surprised by a completely different taste. Wait, as I'm writing this example I realize this is not at all the same thing. Ok wait, you know when you eat something that lingers on your tongue but then you eat something else, it just makes that other something else tastes really weird yet that other something else might actually be really good but it didn't get a fair shake. Yea well, I'm still happy I ate the quesadilla first cuz it was bomb! Explosion of good tasting grilled marinated chicken. 

Get a brownie or two or three too."}
{"text":"O, Qdoba.  She loves me, She loves me not, she. . .

  It's actually really hard to write a review for Qdoba.  I go there on average at least once a week, and so many people talk about it all the time that I figure almost everyone has been there.  But this is yelp, and there are the non-adventurous types.  My following review will be two-fold to try to market to both parties; my first review is for the chain, and my second review is for this particular establishment's location.

Qdoba Chain - 4 Stars-

Qdoba gets almost everything right.  They provide a hefty burrito packed joc-full of ingredients at what I would consider to be a perfectly reasonable price.  $7 for a meal that's above normal fast-food quality without having to tip is acceptable.  Their menu is more diverse than Chipotle, and their ingredients are almost identical set aside some small nuances in the salsas.  I wish they would expand their menu more often, but that'll come in due time.

It's really the tastiness that wins one over.  The ingredients are fresh, the beef and chicken are better than regular fast food by a mile, and they have some great salsas like the three-cheese queso.  I'm pretty sure I could be fed that queso dip in an IV for life and be satisfied :D .  

The main problem holding them back (which I'll touch on in my individual review below) is the service.  Qdoba's service is the definition of \"Hit or Miss.\"  Some locations do a great job with friendly employees who make burritos that don't fall apart and actually listen to you and make you feel like your business is wanted.  Other locations hire ignorant college kids or ex-con blue-collar workers who look like they'd rather spit in your face than make your food.  These workers often get orders wrong, charge you extra for little things like sauce, lettuce, etc, and make issues out of non-issues.  It's been so bad at several locations that I actually wrote Qdoba Headquarters 2 or 3 times.  In fact, in Milwaukee, one location made a local paper's news column because of some injustice it infracted upon some chipotle supporting neighbors.  Lastly, their burritos, while giant, don't always fill the big eaters up, and they offer few sides other than their horrible tasting chips.

University Ave Qdoba Location - 2 Stars

As you can see, from my amalgamated review, this is how I came to a total review of 3 stars.  This particular location on University Ave is not the worst one I've been to, but it certainly gets close.  The majority of the time I go in there, the employees are very rude.  A couple of middle-aged white guys who look like they want to \"take this job and shove it\" constantly don't say hi in return to greetings from myself and other customers, and they sloppily pile ingredients into the burritos so that it's almost guaranteed to not stay together.  The last time I went there, one of the guys came over to the register when he heard me asking for a little queso sauce on my pesto burrito to make sure they charged me a hefty extra fee.  Another time, his fellow employee at the register asked him to mark the burritos with a sharpe (like they do everywhere else) so that he would know what to ring up quicker.  This prompted the co-worker to fling a sharpe at the register guy's face and you could tell the guy at the register was embarrassed and not joking around with his co-worker.

The University Ave location also doesn't have adequate parking or seating.  During lunch and dinner hours, both are packed full of people and you generally either have to get food to go, park illegally, or leave.  This is something that's hard to correct for a business, but overall it makes this location less desirable.

I hope all the negative things I've said don't discourage one from going to doba.  The place has hot delicious food, and it should be tried at least once.  Just don't get crack-addict hooked like me on that queso. . .

{"text":"Staff are really friendly, prepare delicious food quick and make sure your order is correct.
Most of the time someone comes over while I'm eating my meal to see if I'm enjoying it and if I need anything. Great customer service and food."}
{"text":"The food is always excellent!! I love the chips and Queso sauce !! They have one of those fantasy drink machines that you pretty much can pick any soda possible! If you join their club they send you specials in your email and all you have to do is show them your phone to get the discount!! Yummy food and discounts are my fave!!"}
{"text":"I eat at this qudoba about once a week. The staff is very near ce and the food is top notch"}
{"text":"Horrible got our order wrong when we ordered online nothing was right. Never going back to this place guy acted confused didn't know what he was doing obviously! Chipotle is WAY better. Never again."}
{"text":"Lunch hour and the service is friendly but incredibly slow. 1 person running the register, one cooking, 2 running the food. Not adequately staffed."}
{"text":"I placed a simple catering order for Mother's Day, and QDOBA's service failed miserably.  I had confirmation for a 1030am pick up time, even though the restaurant did not open until 11am.  When I got there, the doors were locked, but the staff was inside working.  I tried knocking and waving them down, and all the workers blatantly ignored me.  They would look up at me and walk off.  One girl was smiling and laughing.  I was stuck waiting outside until 11am when a worker finally came to unlock the door.  She didn't even bother acknowledging me, just unlocked and walked off behind the counter.  Finally, as if I was bothering her, she asks what I wanted.  I explained to her that I had a pick up at 1030am.  Seeming quite annoyed, she threw her hands up and shrugged her shoulders saying that she doesn't have any pick up order for 1030.  I showed her my correspondence with the catering coordinator.  After much hoopla, they eventually put my order together and rang me up.  After I reviewed the receipt, I noticed that I was incorrectly charged $27.50 for an item.  When I showed her the mistake, she had to call her manager.  She was speaking in Spanish with the manager, so I was unable to understand what she said.  After she got off the phone, she opened up the register and gave me $17 in cash, and promptly asked if there was anything else.

The service was bottom of the barrel.  I arrived an hour late because of their mistake.  No apology from the staff at all.  On top of that, they made me feel completely unwelcome.  I could have easily gone to Chipotle, Rubio's, or Zabas for similar food but with much more attentive service.  I was supposed to receive a call from the store manager, but never received one.  So instead, I shared my experience as requested on my receipt.  I was supposed to receive a call after that as well, but didn't.  QDOBA completely dropped the ball, and I was hoping they could make it right.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't really know what to say. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good? For quick-fix Mexican I guess it hit the spot. But I would definitely recommend driving down Tryon a bit to go to Sabor instead. 
We were hungry and wanted something fast, so this did in a pinch. Surprisingly the restaurant was completely empty for the majority of our dining experience. But after tasting the so-so flavors of their food, it wasn't that surprising anymore. 
Staff was friendly enough and the tables were clean, so I'll give them that."}
{"text":"I love the 3 cheese nachos with ground beef. It's beyond me why some of the Qdoba locations in the Vegas valley have closed. One of my favorite lunch spots. Only thing they could do to improve quality as far as I'm concerned in completely eliminate trans fat."}
{"text":"Food is good and the employees are friendly, attentive and fast with service. Actually just left chipotle empty handed because I stood in line forever then was told they had to fill online orders. Had the vegetarian taco and daughter had some nachos loaded with chicken and beans. Very filling. When I declined a drink they even offered me a water cup."}
{"text":"This restaurant is lovely. Visiting Charlotte for the first time I went in to Qdoba and got pico on my bowl. I didn't know that the Pico had onions in it and I'm alleegic  top onions. Upon getting back to my hotel room my girlfriend let me know that I had onions in my bowl and in hers as well. I abruptly called the restaurant and they took my name took my number told me that my meal  would be replaced. I walked in two days later and spoke with Corey who abruptly handled the situation, replaced my meal and apologized for the incident. It is great to see restaurants like this that practice great customer service and even when onions are clearly seen in their Pico they still took the blame and put the customer first to ensure that my overall interaction with them was great."}
{"text":"If not for the Buy 1, Get 1 coupon I get from the e-mail club, 
I'd not come here at all. I've had quite a few different menu items, and the carnitas bowl (Mexican gumbo) is very good. My food usually tastes pretty fresh, and the portions are pretty big. Service is usually just so-so, but speaks volumes when there are 10 other Mexican places nearby."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Qdoba. I was always curious about it. I visit Chipotle and Salsarita on a very regular basis. So after getting my eyebrows threaded nearby, I decided to stop in. Benefit, it was right there and I could hurry back to work. I decided to go with a burrito. Points are for the excellent customer service I received. The young ladies working were very patient as I fumbled through the line trying to figure out their sauces. They had all the standard topping except if you prefer a red dipping sauce that doesn't burn your tongue, you won't get it here. They only serve it as hot. Eating the burrito I was very disappointed. No bold flavors. Everything just seemed to mush together. I couldn't distinguish the flavors of the meat from the rice or the beans. I was not impressed at all! So I tried, and they failed."}
{"text":"As a burrito expert and someone with ties in the area I have been to this location a zillion times. The staff is great. The burritos are solid. They are very good when you consider the other options in the area. Place is clean. That's all I can ask for being that clevelands specialty is absolutely not Tex mex."}
{"text":"It's a Friday night, every place around here was busy except for Q-doba.  Should I have taken that as a warning?  Yes. I should have.  

I ordered the 3 grilled chicken tacos in a crunchy shell.  Well it was supposed to be crunchy at least.   The shell didn't hold it's texture at all.  It was bland with a cardboard-like taste.  The chicken tasted like \"Faux meat\", you know the type you can buy in the grocery store freezer section.  It was rubbery and chewy.  And the options available to complete my taco were limited.  What happened to onions, shredded lettuce, just tomatoes?  I opted for the hot salsa which was a minor step up from mild.  Added corn salsa and sour cream.  The sour cream was watered down and the way the person behind the counter just dripped it on the inside and outside of my tacos, it made all of them appear unappetizing (see picture).

Sorry Qdoba you are on the bottom of my list for Fresh Mex.  I won't be back here again."}
{"text":"Something about Qdoba brings out the most romantic side in all of us. There's really nothing sexier than a guy taking down a burrito bigger than your entire purse.

5 stars for true love.
3 stars for the sad, crumbly pieces of tortilla they call chips here."}
{"text":"Fast & friendly and good food too!  Everytime we eat here all the workers are so 
happy.  The food's not bad either.  I like their salads better than Moes although it 
seems as though they don't have the selection of ingredients to choose from. 
Their hot sauce is pleasantly hot, just enough to give the mouth a tingle.  I've had 
their craft two and for Charlotte, you can't beat the price."}
{"text":"Best burrito you'll get anywhere! My coworkers and I come here at least 3 times a week!"}
{"text":"I have ordered catering from this location, as well as ordered for pick-up several times. 

I'll start with catering. They are FANTASTIC. The ordering process is simple, I've placed ordered through their phone number directly, as well as through EZCater.com. Every time I have ordered it has been a pretty substantial order. 35-40 people or so. We typically get the naked burrito bar. The staff who arrives set everything up is always on time, or early. Super friendly. Gets right to work. Usually takes around 15 minutes for setup, but the spread when they leave looks amazing! I have never heard any complaints about the food, and there is always enough. The chips are a big hit. The seasoning they use is great. Bonus - the catering racks they use are left behind. If you bring them back to a store, they give you a free entree! 

As for ordering for pickup, typically no issues there either. It's really nice being able to place an order online and just pop-in to pick it up! We used to do this often at the Fitchburg location. There, we always got what seemed like just a ton of chips with our order. This location seems to skimp a little on the chips, but maybe they aren't skimping at all and Fitchburg was just generous. Minor detail. Still a big fan :)"}
{"text":"I came to Qdoba last Friday with some friends. Qdoba has a great deal where on Fridays, students get a free drink (& I believe 10% off their purchase)! Also, I would recommend students to use Pocket Points to redeem some coupons. The restaurant had plenty of seating and the line to order went by pretty quickly. 

The menu has a decent range of items for reasonable prices. I got two (on the smaller side) tacos for $7 and they were both okay. I enjoyed the rancher taco a little better because it had more flavor. One perk though is that they have the soda machine (large Coca-Cola electronic kind) where there a ton of flavors to choose from. 

Overall, I'd come here again to try different things from their menu!"}
{"text":"Qdoba use to be my favorite spot for Mexican fast food.  Until a recent visit.  Please don't make your operational costs your customer's problems.  After my husband order nachos and was given a small ladle scoop of bottom of the pan queso, he politely asked \"Can I have a little more cheese please?\"  The response, in a sarcastic tone was \"that'll be .99 extra.\"  My husband replied \"Are you joking?\"  The response back \"Not a joke.  This is VERY expensive cheese.  It costs us .99 a scoop.\"  Thanks Qdoba.  We'll take our .99 elsewhere."}
{"text":"For my introduction to this place was rushed and inconsiderate. Guess my high expectations was crushed by the wrong server. Guess I'll stick to what I know across the street where they have sofritas and provide consistent portions. #stillhungry"}
{"text":"I would have to consider myself a regular at Qdoba. Never once have I left this restaurant hungry and or dissatisfied. Quality ingredients is what makes this place so spectacular. I've tried a variety of things on their menu and I can say that I have never once been disappointed. The staff is also very nice. They act like sentient beings and can carry out a conversation, rather than acting like robots which occurs at other fast food joints."}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars. My 'naked' grilled veggie burrito tasted fresh and flavorful, but 'grilled veggies' was limited to zucchini and squash. Also the assembly line system makes for a very uneven burrito. My veggies and beans disappeared under huge scoops of guacamole and cheese. The selection of salsas, however, is great and is sure to satisfy everyone.

Staff: 2 stars. Unfriendly and are obviously just there to get the job done.

Atmosphere: 3 stars. Standard fast food setting. Lots of windows. Attracts a usual business and school crowd, and gets very busy at lunch time.

Price: 2 stars. Expensive for a simple fast food burrito! I could go to a sit down Mexican restaurant and get something much better for about the same price."}
{"text":"I know I know... Qdoba? It's a chain. Yeah, but this place never disappoints me. I like burritos, tacos and my favorite is Mexican gumbo. Yes, its great food. Love the hot sauces. Why not 5 stars? I guess cuz it is a chain fast-food joint and there's cilantro in the rice. Lol"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good Qdoba location. I'm not the biggest fan of Qdoba, but the service is really friendly and the restaurant is very clean. 

When deciding on my order they offered samples of any of the ingredients. It's a great way to get a little taste before committing to anything.

Food was solid and all their produce was fresh, which is key for a salad bowl on the go."}
{"text":"What I typically think about Qdoba is that it's just like Chipotle just not as good. I was in the mood for a burrito bowl and Qdoba was much closer than Chipotle so I thought I'd give them a chance. Pretty much all the same options as Chipotle. They offer brown rice as well, but I decided on white. 

Service was quick and satisfactory. Nothing amazing or noteworthy but it sufficed and I was in and out in less than five minutes. I took my meal home to eat and it was tasty and relatively healthy, depending on what you choose to eat. 

Overall the experience was a 3 1/2 star, but I rounded up for convenience sake. I have to remember that it's in the area, which I always seem to forget."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say this location has gone downhill. Way, way downhill. 

For one, their online ordering system does not notify the employees when an order arrives. When we arrived to pick up our food at the scheduled pick up time, they had to search for the order. Then they started it. 

We asked how come they take online orders and the employee said she didn't know. She said at a different location she worked at, a bell would ring when an online order came in. Here, they have no notification. 

Even with the order in front of them, they got it wrong. 

We checked our bag because our order typically takes two bags and it was all comfortably hanging out in one bag. When we opened the bag, the nachos and tacos were both in \"grocery-store-bought\" blue paper bowls covered in aluminum foil. The portion size of the nachos was 1/3 the size of normal. The kids meal was not what was ordered. 

We refused the nachos, paid and left.  

The steak in the tacos was not the typical Qdoba marinated steak.  The tortillas were not their \"regular\" tortillas. 

I wonder if they lost their franchise and are no longer getting the support from Qdoba corporate or if some manager dropped the ball. 

Either way, I won't be returning to use the remainder of my gift card. 

I have been a long time fan of Qdoba. This is really a sad excuse of a restaurant. 

I hope Qdoba corporate monitors these reviews and steps in. This location has been suffering from massive employee turnover and poor quality control for months. Tonight was the last straw."}
{"text":"Bad service and the place is dirty.the food was still good though, but their service........ugh"}
{"text":"Seems that the rude employees have left, or not there when I visit.  Crew during lunch hours were friendly and fast.  Portions still depend on who is fixing the entree."}
{"text":"Better menu than Chipotle...Food is always great, and always great service."}
{"text":"I rarely write Yelp reviews, but I was astounded at the rating and reviews I read for this place, so I'm making an exception. Worst in Charlotte?!! No way. This is our favorite QDoba in Charlotte! We eat there frequently and have ordered catering from them. They have never, ever disappointed us. The dining room is always clean, the food is consistently good. Someone on the staff generally remembers us and greets us accordingly. We have a fifteen-year-old autistic daughter, and they couldn't be more patient and accommodating with us. Furthermore, they often participate in fundraiser nights for our elementary school. We come back time and time again, and we will continue to do so. I have no problem whatsoever giving them five stars!"}
{"text":"I do not often give reviews, but I had to for this Qdoba. I realize that taking precautions for customers with food allergies is common practice, multiple employees in the line changed gloves, and they even opened up a new bin of cheese since it was right in front of the guacamole (my allergen). I really felt taken care of!"}
