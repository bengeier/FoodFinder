{"text":"I loved the Mississippi  Crab and Corn Bisque soup today. It really hit the spot during this cold weather. The Bisque was very smooth with large lump crab. 

 This little hidden cafe is a wonderful place to meet for a bit to eat, inside the old PTL building."}
{"text":"Wow. I lost my son in this building, but it turns out the food is . I'd really like to eat here until my carbohydrate intake exceeds known values.

Pro tip:
the spachatuli is the best dish"}
{"text":"Update to last review: new chef, and I am really liking the changes!!! They have a great new Italian Panini with Olive Salad on it.

Previous review: I am a 'captive audience' here as I am on staff at the church which owns the building this cafe is located in. Can I just say you have to come here at least once and see Main Street with the lights and all. The place has ambience and can be used very nicely as a venue for weddings and meetings. I am just reviewing the lunch cafe today (but conference and wedding food is always wonderful when either is in the House). 
   My favorite item is the salads. They are huge. I love the Asian, but my husband's favorite is the Cobb Salad with Grilled Chicken, topped with Paul Newman dressings. The Wings are big and flavorful. Their ice tea is great, and they always have both sweet and unsweet. When they have Shrimp Bisque, Loaded Potato Soup or Thai Soup, I love them!
   Don't miss the PTL hallway halfway down Main Street on the right with the old Jim & Tammy Baker memorabilia and the photos of how the grounds used to look."}
{"text":"Wonderful place! Great food prepared fresh, along with very humble people. Small menu but excellent healthy choices. They cater to a smaller community hence the menu but don't be fooled. It's great! Chef Bingle does a perfect job."}
