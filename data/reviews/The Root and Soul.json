{"text":"This is definitely my new favorite place downtown by far! My friends and I came here on First Friday expecting long lines and busy tables but to our surprise, they were quick, friendly, and very helpful! We were greeted with amazing customer service, and very tasteful food. We even got to speak to the owners which were so nice and even helped us find a table! So hard to find great places like this anymore, would definitely recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Had the southern fried chicken today. Boy let me tell you something, this chicken was bomb! I had been craving this place for a while. I seen all the pictures on Instagram. It tastes just as good as it looks! I love how Super convenient it is just couple of blocks from work. I will definitely invite friends and family here and will recommend them more people. Thank you guys for the great meal!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome Mac n cheese was creamy and yams were sweet. Chicken well cooked and crispy."}
{"text":"I had the chicken strips and fries.  The batter and crisp of the chicken was amazing!  Good food, good people, good location."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and the right temperature! The Million Dollar Mac & Cheese is a must taste. Do not leave there without tasting it. The cast iron skillet catfish is the best, you will know the difference after you try it from Root & Soul! The greens hit the spot every time, too. The service is friendly and stress-free, as well. I have brought my mom, three great aunts, my sister, and her boyfriend to Root & Soul. Not a disappointed experience yet. They have all become fellow Root & Soul cheerleaders. Obviously, I can't say enough about this place..."}
{"text":"Had the \"Big Daddy\" with catfish, chicken, hotlink, collards, mac, and sweet potato.  Everything was delicious and the staff is good humored and service oriented. Having spent time in the south, I can say this is better than most soul food in Alabama, Georgia, or Mississippi. My wife loved the chicken and Mac, while I loved the catfish and collards. Truly great experience"}
{"text":"Awesome food, the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree.  The Mac and Cheese is the best.  Matter of fact every item I ate was fantastic.  We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE THIS PLACE! The best Fried Catfish in town. Whether by itself or in a poboy with shrimp and slaw. Their sauce is on point as well.  Love the chicken and waffles. His Million Dollar Mac n Cheese is my favorite. If you are in the mood for some soul food look no where else."}
{"text":"Just came to this new spot located in desoto with my boyfriend and, while I wasn't hungry, he got the spicy chicken sandwich and fries. He said the food was amazing and most notably the service was really excellent. It's obvious that these guys really care about their customers. Definitely recommend trying it out :)"}
{"text":"Check this place out. I had the two piece chicken dinner with greens and yams. Everything was delicious and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"The spicy chicken sandwich is unlike any other!!! My wife and I are new to Phoenix and really enjoyed our stop here. Great food and atmosphere. The owner has a really unique story and is clearly passionate about his craft in the kitchen."}
