{"text":"They have the most amazing carrot cake and brownie cheese cake I have ever had. For some reason it's not on the menu so you'll have to ask the server, but you won't regret it. 

I've recommend to my friends to give the desserts a try and they loved it. Dessert is is differently a must you'll love it I grantee."}
{"text":"Better than most Guyanese Chinese  fried rice and chowmein I have had. One complaint: what's with the sparse meat on top of the special chicken fried rice and chowmein? Need to order more meat in you want to share.... Other than that - friendly staff, good service."}
{"text":"Tonight the food was great and the wait staff was exceptional and very attentive. Couldn't ask for anything better!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on the recommendation of my girlfriends father, who happens to be from Tobago and should know good Caribbean cuisine. Well, he was correct, it was exceptionally good. We ordered;

Fried Chicken Wontons....delicious, light and crispy, done to perfection and i really enjoyed the sauce.

Pepper Shrimp....absolutely stunning, beautifully cooked with a scrumptious badder and served with a lovely (what i would call) pepper salsa and a tangy dipping sauce, in all honesty i would come back just for this dish.  

Chicken Fried Rice...also excellent and served with a bbq'd chicken breast sliced on the top. The chicken was again perfectly cooked and the skin had a beautiful crispness. Rice was well seasoned and cooked perfectly.

Curry Chicken with Roti...again, the chicken was perfect and the sauce was succulent.

This restaurant has a very nice feel/vibe to it. Soft Caribbean music in the background with dim lighting and a very nice bar. The waiter (forgot his name, my bad) was excellent.

Only complaint was that they ran out of duck just prior to me ordering but i will be sure to return and try it, considering how excellent all of the other dishes were. The prices are about 10 dollars a dish and the servings were quite large. All in all, an excellent experience!!!"}
{"text":"Tasteless take out. We spend 80.00 on food that had no taste and we ordered mixed chowmein with chicken on top...there was none I have the receipt and good to prove it. It's like soya sauce on rice and noodles. The pepper wings are so small I feel bad eating it cause I know it's from a baby chick ):. This was our first and last time ordering from here. We will stick to windies and island mix."}
{"text":"Regretfully, I'm gonna have to give this updated review an average rating versus my usual 5 star rating. 

This time around, I ordered a party platter for a birthday and was given some inconsistent information. When I ordered, they gentleman asked if I was paying for cash and when I asked if I get a discount if I do, he said yes - no tax. So I go and pick up my order and was then informed that because 2 of my orders were \"regular orders\" and not a party platter, I have to pay tax. I then advised the manager in duty that I was misinformed and to just make sure that all her staff are aware of that and to advise customers with the right policy. She not only gave me attitude but she put one of her staff on the spot and threw her under the us saying \"You wrote that!\". I immediately defended her and said \"It wasn't her who I spoke with, it was a gentleman\". I also did tell the MoD that I have no problem paying the tax, just that she needs to make sure that her employees provide the correct information. I didn't bother telling her that I have gone here so many times and this is the first time I've had a bad experience. I think what made it worse was how she treated her employee. 

As for the food, I ordered a party size platter of the Sweet and Sour Chicken, which to be quite honest, looked more like leftovers that was pre-heated. I've had this dish many times and this time around, it didn't have that nice crispiness to it. Yes, it was still tasty, but the texture was off. Again, it was like pre-heated leftovers. So my tip is: **DO NOT ORDER THIS PARTY PLATTER** and save your $65 (which I could've spent elsewhere, by the way, but chose this place since previous times were on point). 

The Pepper Fish on the other hand was delicious and fresh. This you can tell was freshly made. 

Will I come back? Yes. But will probably never order a party platter again."}
{"text":"I've been to the restaurant so many times! Everything I've tried has been delicious and the portions are huge! My favorite still remains the mixed Lo Mein! Friendly and quick service! Awesome atmosphere! Party nights are also great!"}
{"text":"The Avenue Restaurant and Lounge is a great place to dine and have drinks with friends. Please view below some of my recommended items on the menu:

Appetizers:
Pepper Shrimp
Spicy Squid

Mains:
Chilli Chicken with your choice of Fried Rice or Noodles.

BBQ Duck with your choice of Fried Rice or Noodles.

When have drinks with friends try one of the beer bucket specials or rev up your drinks."}
{"text":"Great food! I really enjoyed all the food, we ordered: 
- Curry Conch (great)
- Chow Mien (great) 
- Fried rice (great)
- Fried wontons (So yummy, sauce was so so, need a traditional red sauce)
- Amazing deal on Corona beer, 4 beers and a lb of wings for $20, the wings were super! 

They disn't have a mixed drink menu, however the bartender (forgot her name/although very awesome), mixed me a great drink in the shaker. Thanks! A drink menu would be a great addition to this place, I would love it! Like 5 signature drinks, as they are doing deals with buckets of beer, the ladies like a deal too! The service was AMAZING! Nice decor as well. I will be coming back and want to hit them up during late hours for the lounge atmosphere. Xx"}
{"text":"Calamari. TO DIE FOR. never had Caribbean Hakka. Wicked sauce.
First time at avenue... definitely not the last. Friendly service. Super quick delivery of food to the table. 
This is a hidden Scarborough gem if you ask me."}
{"text":"Went here with a large group this week and I must say it's a hidden gem. From the outside the store doesn't look like anything special but inside it's completely different story. We ordered a few mixed platters and chilli chicken dishes. The wings and shrimp platter were amazing and very well priced for the quantity. Definitely going to try this place again."}
{"text":"We decided to try here since we always went to drupati's to eat. The place is real nice. The staff were very polite and attended to us promptly. Music was great, atmosphere was chills and food was really good. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This is the Moxie's or Joey's comparison to the West Indian restaurant/bar scene in Scarborough. Based on the decor and spotlessness alone. I can only comment on the Pepper Shrimp. These butterflied shrimp had a crispy batter and was loaded with chilli flakes, green chillies, and onions. It also came with a nice mayo (kinda chipotle-ish) dip. The drink menu is a tad bit competitive $$$."}
{"text":"Very impolite 
Didn't give us our full order 
Hung up while trying to discuss
Manager said she can compensate us but then change her mind saying she cant do anything 
Didn't want to compensate  for anything"}
{"text":"Came here randomly with a date and it was my first visit. We were seated right away and service was pretty fast for a Friday night. I got the cane sugar mojito which was pretty good and fortunately for me they didn't hold out on the alcohol:) I personally didn't order any food but I did taste the chicken fried rice and pepper fish (I think that's what it was called) from my date and thought it was quite tasty. 

Appearance wise, it's pretty dark inside but with lots of light fixtures hanging from the ceiling. A DJ was also playing music pretty loud so if you're hoping to have intimate conversations then this is the wrong spot. 

Overall I'd give this place another shot on a less busy day."}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times a good experience overall.  It's a restaurant/sport bar but more upscale than your typical sports bar.  In the evening (at least the Friday night we were there) there is a DJ spinning tunes.  

The owner/servers (??) are really nice and friendly.   It's a Trini/Chinese style of food but per the server they are trying to do things a little differently to stand out against the other West Indian/Hakka places in the area.

I'm going to cut to the chase and just say ORDER THE PEPPER SHRIMP.  Had it twice now and I'm addicted.  I will always order this from here from now on.

Between the 2 visits had the mixed chow mein, peeper shrimp, pepper fish, wings, chicken fried rice and goat curry.  While the do have curry on the menu, they get this from Drupati's (located besides them) so you can only order the curry if Dru's is open.

With the exception of the chicken fried rice which I found a bit salty and more wet (I like fried rice a bit more on the drier side) everything was good.

For the pepper shrimp alone I'd come back"}
{"text":"Both times going was at night and it was great. The portions are great and the taste is great, and so is the pricing. The atmosphere is very chill and relaxing too, but both times we went it was during the weekday, sometime midweek so I'm sure it wasn't as busy, so there was not a lot of people. Would definitely recommend the goat curry, avenue fried rice, and the chilli chicken :)"}
{"text":"Super cheap and really good food. All the food portions are shareable ( between 2-4 people) but cost cheap.The restaurant itself small but has nice atmosphere. Also the waiters are so nice and very attentive. Its def one top favs."}
{"text":"Anything you have from their menu is delicious. My husband and I loved their fried squid (calamari) the most! Their service was good even though they were quite busy."}
{"text":"Their pepper fish is DIVINE.  Dry or with a sauce, it is extremely flavorful and melts in your mouth. My hubby and I were here on a couple of occasions and deem this as one of our special go-to spots.  We usually get a couple of orders of the pepper fish, chicken fried rice and some mixed veggies. Their portions are more than enough."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is good, service is great. Definitely eat the fried chicken! My mouth is watering just thinking of it. Love the music and atmosphere too. Good place for all ages, maybe check though if late eaters, kids may not be welcome after a certain time"}
{"text":"Superb Chili chicken with fried rice lunch special at $7.99!  

Ordered also:

Szechuan beef with fried rice $8.99.
Special fried rice $8.95.

Generous servings!!!

Fried rice had a smoky/Caribbean/Hakka taste."}
{"text":"Awesome service and holy portions...yes every portion is filling for at least 2 people. The flavor is awesome also. The menu was not the most descriptive however once the food came I couldn't think about anything else and almost had to have a forklift take me to my vehicle. Every item that I had is worth the price!

FYI Tuesdays are wing special days."}
{"text":"If you know anyone from the Caribbean or just want to try Caribbean food, this is the place to eat. The ambiance is pretty nice. Has that pub feel, and you'll get your fill of Caribbean entertainment. The food is the best representation of classic Trini and Trini Chinese food to be exact. You won't be disappointed. The only thing is you better go early or call to make sure they have seats available. It seems to be a very popular spot. Should you pay this restaurant a visit I would try the curry goat with white rice. Can't go wrong with that classic Trini dish."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go on Tuesday night for wings with a west Indian flair. Their pepper shrimp and pepper squid are amazing. Prices are great and ambience is very nice. The service has been great every time we frequent this restaurant."}
{"text":"Albeit a very interesting dining experience combining Chinese food at a bar/lounge ambience, this place does not serve great food. Mediocre at best. The chicken was dry and the food just salty and blend. You can go to any Chinese restaurant for way better food at half the price."}
{"text":"Yep, i've found my go-to Trini place whenever I want to hear soca in Scarborough. 
the music's great, the crowd is usually good, the decor is good and tasteful. I've only eaten there like twice, but the wings were great, and the other wings were great..sorry I hardly ever know what I'm eating...ah well.."}
{"text":"This restaurant has quickly become my new go to for West Indian food. First of all what struck me the most was the decor. First time I've ever seen such an upscale looking West Indian restaurant. Definitely has the lounge vibe with the dim lighting, soca music, and huge bar located off on one side. The restaurant itself is long and narrow with a mix of pub height tables and regular tables.
Hubby and I came in for a late lunch on the Sunday of the Caribana weekend. The place wasn't too packed yet and we just seated ourselves at the table closest to entrance.
Right away a waiter came to greet us and handed us some menus and took our drink orders.
This is what we ordered:

Chicken Fried Rice - Nice big portion, good seasoning, not oily, fresh tasting with a smokey flavour, little chunks of diced chicken and fresh veggies throughout

Crispy Chicken - This has to be the Best fried chicken I've had from any West Indian restaurant! The skin was soo crispy and golden it just melted in your mouth! The chicken was really juicy and came out piping hot - probably straight from the fryer. A good size portion for a half chicken as well.

Beef with Broccoli - Simple and Fresh. Beef was tender, light gravy, perfectly cooked veggies, your standard style Chinese stir fry but none the less tasty.

Spicy Chicken - Perfectly crisp and golden batter, coated in a light red sauce but not too spicy, garnished with sautéed onions and fresh sliced jalapeños for an extra kick 

Standout points for this restaurant was portion size! Everything came on big platters served family style with an ample servings. As well it was all fresh tasting and came out fast and piping hot with steam coming off of every dish. Service was on par here as well. Our waiter checked on us several times as did another waitress. Plus at the end we had a ton of leftovers despite going in for seconds and thirds and our waiter kindly packed up everything to go for us. I will definitely be making a return when my craving for West Indian food strikes again!"}
