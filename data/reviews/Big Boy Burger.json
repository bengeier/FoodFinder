{"text":"I noticed a new staff member recently and she was very pleasant and brightened my day!"}
{"text":"I've been to big boy burger a few times. The last time I came I had their 6 ounce burger with fries and their 2 piece fried chicken. To my surprise the fried chicken came with fries and slaw which made me happier, felt like i was getting more bang for my buck. This time I got the chicken souvlaki dinner. It came with rice, fries, some vegetables, chicken, and a Greek salad. It was quite enjoyable and it was enough to share between two people. 

I'd recommend checking this place out, I can say for sure that I will be coming back. Next time I come I'll try their 8 ounce burger."}
{"text":"This is my first time finding this place. After reading few reviews on yelp, I decided to try it. Glad i did. Its the best burger made the way i remember a burger should be. You have to wait a while, but its worth it. All the toppings are fresh. I had the 6oz burger and fries and pop, just under 10 dollars, you would pay the at Mcdonalds and get less or cold. I am definitely coming back and telling everyone about this place, its good to find a Mom and Pop restaurant , instead of a chain."}
{"text":"Changed ownership. Additions made to menu. Now offer shawarma and falafel. Changed their gravy. Stopped using real cheese curds for poutine. Also added subs, sausage on a bun, chicken sandwich and fish. Delivery is a new service."}
{"text":"My husband and I, had burgers and poutine. Oh my goodness. The best burger from a takeout place. Great tasting and a variety of toppings. Yummy. We also had the poutine and that was awesome. I ate it for 2 meals. I can't wait to have it again. Thanks for having a great place. We will be back, for sure"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, restaurant was clean and the burgers were above average. Just over $10 for 6 ounce bacon cheeseburger combo."}
{"text":"New place in town, decided to try it out since I've never been to one in either Canada or the States. The Big Boy burger is huge, pretty pricey considering there is no combo's available. Cash only and all your orders are individual with a price tag of 3.29$ for one size only. It tastes like American fast food but needs bigger side portions for the price. I will eat here again but a few small changes will def raise this establishments star level but hey, it just opened so it can only get better or worse. This is the feel out stage and it passed"}
{"text":"Friendly service, good food and good prices. Vegetable burrito was good  - lots of rice and vegetables - but served slow - after other person in our party was already eating.  Suggestion - complete close up  floor cleaning after customers have eaten as the chemical smell takes away from the food. We would recommend eating at Big Boy Burger."}
{"text":"Friendly staff.
Very good deal for 2 burgers, fries and drinks.. 14.99.
It I'm in Georgetown, I'd return"}
{"text":"Too expensive.. Burgers are plain,  no originality in their burgers. For a burger joint that charges a premium you don't really get much in terms of taste... Maybe in terms of quantity but nonetheless it did not taste very good at all. When I bit into the onion rings grease was bursting out."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that we go to often. The burgers are very good and onion rings are equal to what you would find anywhere

The chicken Slovakia is amazing. Chicken is always cooked well and portions are generous"}
{"text":"One of the few, non-chain places open later in the evening in Georgetown!

Menu consists of diner staples like burgers, hotdogs, fries, subs, burritos, Greek specialties like souvlaki/tzatziki, & wings.  Nice and succinct, nothing too overwhelming.  Entire menu is posted, but there is also a takeout menu.

I was looking for some post-theatre grub, but none of the places in downtown stood out, so I just drove less than 2km to Big Boy.  We shared a Chicken Souvlaki dinner (2 skewers of meat, rice, fries, steamed veg, pita, & a huge salad of our choice), and there weren't any leftovers!  

Fries were fresh cut, meat wasn't overcooked and tender, and all the veg was FRESH.  I was actually impressed that there was colour from a diner meal.  Contrary to other diners, there wasn't too much carbs like fries or rice.  Just the right amount!

I'd definitely go back if I was ever in the same area.  Service is your typical order-at-the-counter diner.  Most patrons seemed to be local."}
{"text":"I will always recommend this place to people! They have such a wide variety of food to choose from! Cook it right in front of you! When my boyfriend and myself go in (every couple months or so) the owners always remember us! They are very friendly portions are fantastic! Food is delicious! Keep up the good work :)"}
