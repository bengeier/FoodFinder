{"text":"Enjoyed the Tortellini and the service was excellent. Bypass the wanna be places like the Tilted Kilt in this area and go to a real place for food."}
{"text":"Just got a kale and steak salad to go for lunch.  Walked back to my office, opened it up and noticed it didn't have half of what was supposed to be in it (kale, quinoa, caramelized onions).  Took a couple bites of it as/is and it was terrible - lettuce wilted and steak raw on the inside.  Called the restaurant to let them know and of course they said if I came back they'd make me a new one.  It's 95 degrees outside and I don't care to make the 10 minute walk again.  No refund offered.  What a waste of money.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed dinner here. Loved the ambience, which reminded me of being in NYC. The service was excellent as was the food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food is horrible! We had chicken Parmesan which tasted like old salty tomatoes and creamy vegetable pasta which tasted like glue! Stay away! Very disappointed and waste of money."}
{"text":"Sit in the back by the storage closet..... And get the Mac n Cheese........ The End........ And get a Sangria..... The real end...... Now will this post or is it still too short for posting"}
{"text":"I'd like to something favorable about this place. The restaurant next door had an hour wait so we decided to try the Strand. BIG MISTAKE!!! We were quickly seated but were promptly IGNORED for the next 30 minutes. I knew it wasn't just us as others were commenting on the terrible service. Thankfully, we still had time to visit the Tilted Kilt just down the street before our show. Thanks for nothing Strand. That's no way to treat your customers!!"}
{"text":"Service was great but the food wasn't noteworthy.  We ordered lasagna & chicken alla vodka with salads.  The lasagna was cold and the vodka sauce was bland."}
{"text":"Came to town for the College Football National Championship. Excellent service, pasta, drinks and scenery. 100% recommended. Don't listen to these other negative reviews. Roll Tide"}
{"text":"Food was horrible! Service wasn't much better......we just moved into city scape and we are trying new places, and now this is off our list. 

Clams and mussels were very salty!!! Tried the lobster Mac n cheese and it was dry. 

Definitely won't be back!!!"}
{"text":"Hidden little gem. Great staff and good! Highly recommend the shrimp and broccoli alfredo!"}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant once before for lunch. I had a salad. Nothing to write home about. So when I had a dinner meeting scheduled last night at Strand, I had no expectations. The food was non significant but not horrible. The salmon I order well came to the table medium rare. I ate two bites at the ends. The rest was inEdible. After paying our bill, my group of four noticed a cockroach as big as my thumb crawling against the wall. It made my skin crawl! I showed the slow crawling cockroach to the waitress. She didn't flinch. She signaled she saw the roach with a nod of her head the shouted out to someone by the kitchen as to signal \"another roach sighting\". 

I will not be back every again. This morning my stomach is turning and I have been in the bathroom on and off. Not sure if it was the Angry Shrimp (which was too spicy to enjoy) or an indication of a nasty kitchen. Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"I took my brother and his GF for dinner. 
Food: 
Calamari appetizer: good amount to split between three, nice crunch and tasted fresh.
Creamy Alfredo w/chicken: my brother ordered it, I tried it. Very creamy. He finished it all.
Salmon and Grilled Vegetable: I ordered this, the salmon was so flavorful and juicy. Really enjoyable meal. I don't usually like salads, but this hit the spot after all the holiday carbs.
Pomodoro: the GF got this. I didn't try it, but she said it was good.

Drinks: 
Cabernet Sauvigon - I love wine, I ordered it to expand my brother's palette... we switched drinks and he really liked the cucumber martini.
2 Cucumber Crush Martinis: I tried it, soo yummy. It was strong, but still had flavor. Hit all around!

Ambiance: loved the decorated walls and interesting lighting fixtures. We were the only ones there for a while until a family came in. It's a hidden gem.

$100 for three people!!? Yes, definitely worth a try, I will have to take others there when I go back in town."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch the other day because it was close by, and WOW what a wonderful surprise! The food is delicious, great service too. I will be coming in again with my husband to taste more!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Find! We both had great salads for lunch - Calamari salad for one, Pear & Goat Cheese salad for the other - and they were superb. Bread and dipping oil were also good. Service was excellent, although slow (but it WAS during Lunch Rush). Sophisticated atmosphere without  being \"urban pretentious.\" Tables are close enough together that you'd better watch what you say if you don't want to be overheard. Check out their weekday Breakfast offerings, too - they look good. We highly recommend, and plan to go again soon."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for awhile. Service was great, good reasonable prices. Food was good and had a nice selection of beers to choose from. Will definitely be going here again."}
{"text":"Went to The Strand last night and was disappointed enough to write a review. It was our second visit in the past six months and it will certainly be our last.
For starters, the temperature inside was too cool even though the outdoor temperature was only in the upper 40's. My meal was cold halfway into it and I am a pretty fast eater (my wife reminds me).  The bread came out and the appetizer plates were still wet. We opened our napkin rolls and the napkins were still damp as if they had been taken out of the dryer far too early. My leg became chilled from the damp cloth laying on it partially due to the chilly temperature of the restaurant and partially due to the damp cloth napkin.
My wife was chilly enough to order a coffee prior to dinner. Upon telling the server that she was cold and needed a cup of coffee the response was only that they did not have coffee, only espresso. My wife ordered a tea that became cold fairly quickly and as I glanced up at the large drink menu behind the bar I saw that they had Cafe Americano listed. That would have been a good suggestion for a coffee substitute had our server been on her game.
The appetizer, Risotto Arancini, was so-so. My wife's Meatballs and \"Strands\" was served warm but she felt as though the meatballs were previously frozen and not homemade. Nothing to write home about. My entree, Chicken Piccata, was lacking in the flavor department and as I previously mentioned was cold half way through trying to enjoy it.
Apart from the restaurant being too cold there was nothing terrible about the experience it's just that is was a mediocre meal with less that professional service. The server that waited on the table next to us squatted down and rested his arms on one of the table's chairs to take their order. Unfortunately we see this a lot in our current society but I want a professional, well informed yet non-intrusive server that adds to the quality of the dinning experience. Not another dinner buddy.
This was not \"A Unique Dining Experience\" that they self proclaim. Just over priced for the sub-par dining experience."}
{"text":"The chicken alla Vodka was very taste, the minestrone soup was quite nice. The fried zucchini appetizer was light and crispy. Finished off with the bread pudding which was just right amount of crispy with soft inside."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Went to eat here Saturday night before a movie. After waiting in line for 20 minutes they said they could no longer take food orders and asked us to leave. I have never heard of a restaurant dealing with customers like this. I was excited to have an Italian fast casual restaurant in my neighborhood but I do not think I will be eating here again. Food is ok, but I would suggest not eating here when it is a busy night. Clearly the management is not up for the job."}
{"text":"Host practically sleeping at the stand. It took him a minute to process our request \"table for 2.\" There are several large groups here which has stolen our server's time and attention. Food was fine. Sweet potato fries awesome. Seafood Linguini was not too impressive....snooze"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to dinner here on a friend's recommendation. We were so glad we did! The prices were reasonable and the food and service were amazing! All of the staff was very friendly, stopping by to chat with us and see how we were doing, and the manager seemed genuinely interested in our happiness. The lights are fun, too - they look like impressionistic pasta. :-) If you like seafood, pasta or cheese, then you will be quite pleased. We are planning to return in the very near future.

{"text":"Feel bad for hard working bartender Sarah.  She works hard while the kitchen boys clown.  Ordered a pizza, that showed up undercooked and gross.  Sent most back and said - I'll take the check 
Will not return even under duress"}
{"text":"The pasta is pretty good. I like their hamburger with the fries the most. My co-worker loves this place. Service can be a little slow so you will need to have patience but I think it is a good place to eat"}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was a little slow.  We got there at 5:30 thinking it was early enough.  We got seated right away and our drinks came fast but then there was a rush of new people coming in and it took awhile to see our waiter again to take our order.  I think since there was a Suns game that night they just didnt have enough staff."}
{"text":"My BIL, my son (who's a toddler) and I ate here. We stopped a couple of places down first, but apparently that place doesn't like kids because they had neither booster seats or high chairs. So The Strand it was. We both had the chicken with vodka sauce, which we both really liked. He also had the house Merlot which he thought was really good. The service was fairly attentive, forgot just one item. But I ordered from the Kid's menu, wanting spaghetti for my little guy, and the menu listed penne. I knew that was a no go. So she said she could sub in another pasta. Was is spaghetti? No, but very close. Are the noodles thicker? Yes, but it's just like spaghetti, promise.  I said I was unsure, she assured me it was similar enough. My son isn't old enough to have figured out the conversation himself, but he was sure that wasn't spaghetti when it hit the table. Wouldn't touch it. Fortunately I had brought  a couple of things with me so I fed him those instead, but we didn't need to waste money on his kid's meal."}
{"text":"Really great little place!  Cool vibe, excellent food."}
{"text":"Service is usually pretty slow so make sure you have time to spend! Food is pretty good but if you go on a night where there is an event in DTPHX with lots of people the prices are jacked up about $5 per plate! The Pasta Primavera is really good and you have to try the Lobster Mac!"}
{"text":"The reason for only two stars is not because of the food. I ordered the Quinoa dinner and it tasted great with fresh vegetables cooked perfectly. We had bruschetta which was served very interesting, you had to make it yourself so to speak it was served with the bread on the side of a bowl of Tomatoes.  We had two waitress's who seemed to both disappear when it came time to eat... We asked for bread with our dinner and it came after we had finished. She mentioned it needed to be cut was why it took so long. No apologies. Also when we didn't have silverware it was because it needed to be rolled. It was odd service to say the least. The waitress kept putting her hair up and down playing with it, I found that in poor taste. I would have enjoyed it more if the service was better."}
{"text":"I love this place :) The bruschetta is my favorite appetizer ....  I also love the Quinoa!  Every time I've gone, the service has always been excellent!"}
{"text":"The food arrived quick. It took them no time at all to pull the bolognese sauce out of the can.  The only thing good about the restaurant is the location. But it does not make up for the meals. Not going back."}
{"text":"Service and attention is definitely slow. The sound system is annoying with a loud, thumping bass. Not something I want while eating. I've been waiting twenty minutes and am sitting with bread and water.  Just received my side, dinner salad. Very large for the $3 price. Also very bland. I asked for more salad dressing and almost finished m my salad before it came. I hope the entree exceeds the experience so far.  Redemption... sort of. A very large chicken parmigiana. Adequate flavor. Certainly does not lure me to take another bite.  They should put a little more attention to flavor and service and not impress people just with portion size."}
{"text":"Great little spot I've passed it so many time and never realized it was there. Amazing Italian did, I've had the lobster mac and cheese with drunken breadsticks, left me so full and definitely happy. Then I also had the Salsiccia Di Pollo, so good! I would definitely recommend this place for really good Italian food that is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I'm in town working for a SuperBowl related function, several days before the game.   I went to this restaurant because the menu on their website looked tasty and affordable.   I was greeted with a menu that had prices more than DOUBLE those that were on their website.   The pasta dish I ordered might have been passable at the original menu price.  It was a major rip-off at the inflated price I paid.   The dish was bland, with overcooked generic boxed pasta.   I had to use a bunch of salt and nearly the whole shaker of Parmesan cheese to give it some taste.  

The only saving grace was the fast service and friendly waitress.  

The restaurant was empty, so this was not a case of immediate supply and demand.  This was price-gouging plain and simple."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink only so I can't comment on the food, except that the menu & the food coming out of the kitchen looked and smelled so good that we'll go for lunch or dinner next time. The cucumber crush martini was outstanding & the service was good."}
{"text":"Sports crowd, loud overhead music, crowded seating, and most of the food was generic, as if delivered as prepackaged right off the truck. Generic hotel restaurant type food - didn't seem like the menu was prepared specially for the restaurant by a chef. Caesar salad was bland. Lasagna was nothing special. Seafood on the seafood linguini was small and not fresh. Everything seemed pre-made. We left thinking we could have had a better meal at home, and we paid over $80 for two people. I was surprised by the high ratings. We will not go back. There are better restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Came to the area for a conference and was looking for something local. Would definitely go back. Pesto dipping sauce for bread is amazing."}
{"text":"This restaurant is EXCELLENT!  The decor is very modern and so cool.  The staff is very polite and friendly.  The food is brilliant!  My husband and I both got the spaghetti and meatballs.  It is probably the best I've ever had. The sauce is creamy and perfectly seasoned.  The meatballs have a tang and burst with flavor.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good inexpensive lunch stop.  Great food.  Never had a problem getting seated during the lunch rush.  We go pretty regularly and will continue to."}
{"text":"The Strand was a good place to eat in Phoenix, but nothing that really stood out to me. It was not a true authentic Italian restaurant. It satisfied my group and I for dinner. I had the salmon with pasta, the salmon was great served over steamed spinach. The past was average needed more flavor. My fiend had the pasta mac and cheese, it was missing a crispiness on top. Overall, good place for the atmosphere, good service food was average."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, the Martinis were to die for and the service was excellent. Plus Happy Hour prices made it a perfect choice"}
{"text":"Decent lunch place after fan fest at chase. 

Seated promptly after most things on down town were closed after 2 pm on a Sunday. Decided on a fig and proscuto piZza. While I had wished the prosciutto was fried and crispy on top, it didn't disappoint. I intended on eating half and proceeded to eating the whole pie.

Girlfriend had a balsamic salad with chicken. While the greens were crisp and well seasoned croutons were the best I have had, the chicken breast was cooked into submission and came out with a mealy dry texture. 

Dani was our waitress; she was prompt and not overly chatty or interrupting ever 3rd sentence while we were enjoying our conversation. Not sure what customer service issues other yelp people have had, but ours was very pleasing."}
{"text":"All but one of our entrees was cold, and one of our appetizers was also cold. Server was slow in coming and taking our orders. It was busy, but she could have at least acknowledge our existence. Service could be lots better, especially considering the prices. Most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I adore the Strand, and wanted to give our server a shout out from last night. Kristen was incredibly helpful and sweet after an error on our part and a kitchen error. We'd also like to thank the manager, I believe his name was Ross. You guys were outstanding, thank you so much."}
{"text":"Excellent

Service is great and the food is very tasty. 
All of their items taste home made.  Nothing tastes pre packaged.  

They validate parking, too! And they have a decent amount of gluten free options."}
{"text":"The Strand has great food and fantastic service. I went there with a couple of my friends for birthday lunch, and our waitress was incredibly nice and outgoing. We ordered a variety of food, all of which was delicious. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"WARNING... TYPING THIS REVIEW WHILE CONSUMING THE BEST PIZZA EVER!!

I couldn't wait to write a review about the newest downtown restaurant - I am still eating. The Strand is a welcome addition to the downtown lunch and dinner spots. Their staff, menu, service, pricing, and ambiance is great. Ordered a garlic pizza (best combination of flavors and toppings I have EVER had on a pizza) with pesto on the side to dip. I am a pesto-connoisseur, and theirs is tops!

Not a long wait for my pizza (less than 10 minutes), but you can call your order in ahead, too.

I can't wait for lunch tomorrow to try something else! And for happy hour after work to try the delish-sounding frozen peach Bellini!

YAY STRAND!!"}
{"text":"Great lil gem. Make sure to ask for Ashley! Knows the menu, friendly personality wo being over bearing! We had shrimp and bread apps. Great sauces on both!  Only minimal downside is that we'd have liked more sauce with the mussels. Great experience."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Generous portions. Salad was excellent. Pasta (it was the daily special, so I don't know a name) was cooked well; sauce was tasty but nothing spectacular. House-prepared bread pudding was very good. Modest wine list, but adequate variety.

My service was lousy, but everyone has a bad night. Yours would probably (and easily) be better.

Price and convenient location were other criteria for me. All things considered, I got what I bargained for."}
{"text":"We should have ran the other way when we walked in and only saw 1 table filled... On a Friday night. After eating here, I understand why only 1 table was filled. Food was nothing special at all. Regretful, in fact. I don't see this place lasting more then another month if each Friday only has 1-2 tables filled."}
{"text":"The calamari we ordered was cold and the food was just very bland. I don't suggest coming here."}
{"text":"This is a TOP Restaurant on FoodTube.net, The Video Guide to TOP Restaurants.  Check out their video:

{"text":"We came here only because we were downtown and needed to eat in a hurry. The fact that every other restaurant on the block had at least a 45-minute wait was a red flag, but I thought, how bad can Italian food be? As it turns out, terrible. Everything tastes like it came from a school cafeteria."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great meal with outstanding service in a very nice setting in downtown Phoenix,  food was delicious and the staff very friendly and the service was very good.  Definitely make this a destination if your in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary dinner. We got there late night so it wasn't crowded at all. Here's the breakdown:

Pros:
*Food was decent
*Nice vibe
*TVs inside and there was a soccer game going
*Waiter was nice

 Cons:
*Took way too long for hostess to seat us
*Food was tasty but my husband's suspicions were raised because it came out very quickly

I would go back again, for drinks and a late meal because it was a cozy spot."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. Lobster Mac and Cheese was the worst I've ever had. They just took penne lobster and cheese and through it together. Very unimaginative. Service was dreadful too.  Waitress took our drink and appetizer order then disappeared for 40 minutes, and I'm not exaggerating.  I won't be returning. There are no less than one hundred Italian Restaurants in the Valley that are better than this place.  I should have known when the Titled kilt and Arrogant Butcher each had over an hour wait to be seated and the Strand had an empty restaurant that there was a reason for that."}
{"text":"My family and I came in worn out and unhappy with what had just happened. Having to leave another good rated place. We were seated right away and ordered quickly, our food came out fast and delicious. The lobster mac and cheese was absolutely my favorite dish there! Overall I would come back again without a doubt."}
{"text":"Favorite Italian place in Phoenix. I've ordered multiple dishes and they were all amazing. They rotate in new dishes regularly so there's always something new to try. Very friendly upbeat staff!"}
{"text":"Very salty food obscenely slo service cheese cake was stale 2 appetizers and desert took 2 hours"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at the Strand today.  We shared a chicken Parmesan pizza, and a pressed, fresh veggie sandwich.  We also had Cesar salad and minestrone soup.  Every thing was home made ad tasted great.   The staff was friendly, helpful and attentive to our needs.  Very unique / eclectic, comfortable decor.  Nice size portions and a very reasonable price.  

This is my new go to restaurant when I have meetings downtown."}
{"text":"We were just walking by trying to decide where to eat. We saw the sign that said lasagna special.  We LOVE lasagna!  Decided to give 'em a try. Imagine our disappointment when we try to order and they say that they are out of lasagna. .. Wait, what?  An Italian restaurant out of lasagna? ? AND they weren't open very long. LOL!  Still, the roast beef was good and the pasta pomadoro was delicious.  I would recommend them,  so check them out next time you down town."}
{"text":"Went on Monday night. Food was delcious. I wanted the small plate butternut squash, almost like a primavera with protien. They delivered an incredible meal. My brother for Spaghetti and Meatballs ( called something else) his was delicious (he's picky). GREAT prices too"}
{"text":"Jeremiah is great! He is very friendly, patient, and knows what he's doing! 

We started off with the Drunken Cheesy Bread, it's ok. Not something I would want again. Nothing wrong with it, just not my taste. 

For lunch, I had the Chicken Parmesan sandwich, along with a house salad. The sandwich is great. Loved it. 
The house salad... I mean, I could not stop eating it. I have no idea which kind of dressing was on it, but it was AMAZING. I am craving it just thinking about it. 

The interior is very clean, roomy, very casual. I heard they have great happy hour, so I will be back again."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE ever and mediocre food....came here for a quick bite before the Suns game. The atmosphere is really nice and it looks fancy and expensive but it's actually reasonably priced. We sat down right away and waited 10 min just to put our drink orders in. We got our drinks within 5 minutes and ordered Calamari and a side salad...that's it! The calamari came out so fast literally within 7 minutes and it was absolutely disgusting. There was no flavor at all! We're waiting 25 minutes and my salad still hasn't arrived! Literally a side salad, oh and let's not forget my waiter was no where to be found. I saw the hostess walking around and I told them to cancel the salad and take the calamari off cuz it's disgusting and we're not eating it or paying for it. 
Our \"waiter\" was also the bartender and never came back to check on us. I'm also pretty sure that bread is complimentary and we NEVER got any. 
I also noticed that people around were looking for a server to place their order and based on reviews here the service ALWAYS sucks. 
I definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best in Phoenix!! I had a Marguerite pizza and it was absolutely delicious! I also had a Cesar salad that was so fresh! My dad had a salmon plate and he could not stop talking about how good it was! I was surprised about how good it was for being a corner restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on Saturday night with a few friends. Our waiter, James, was terrible. He was rude unhelpful. He rarely came to check and see if we needed anything, and if we did ask him for anything, we would never receive it. I asked for a glass of water 3 times, and still never received it. Our table was never given bread, until we asked another server to grab it for us. I would not suggest this restaurant, unless average food and bad service is your forte."}
{"text":"Close to our hotel and surrounded by other restaurants and bars....the patio advertised a special.... the \"drunken shrimp\" had me and hello. Not always a fan of Italian, but I was excited to see what the Strand had to offer. We were exhausted from the Spring training games and the weather was perfect outside for mid March. So, we sat outside..........the restaurant was bustling busy, but we were seated right away and offered drink specials, menu etc. Sitting outside always has its plus side beside the breeze on a perfect night, but the walking traffic was entertaining to say the least. If you are offended by the homeless, I suggest do not sit out side - but we felt comfortable and enjoyed our views of the city lights and busy Rickshaw's none the less. The service was delightful, we received the complimentary bread and olive oil/balsamic for dipping and ordered a great bottle of wine. Our food came quickly and the drunken shrimp special was AMAZING! My partner in crime ordered the Chicken Parmesan and easily filled his tummy with room to spare for Tiramisu which was so silky smooth and delicious. There were couples and families with children - so I would say family atmosphere.Large portions for the price and we were truly happy with our dining choice for the evening. Until next March Strand, see you soon."}
{"text":"OMG if I could give this place ZERO stars it would so deserve it!! My partner and I went for dinner and drinks and it was the worst place ever!! It was so over priced for the crappy weak drinks and horrible tasting food!! C'mon you'd have to be a total idiot to ruin something as simple as chicken Alfredo!! It had absolutely no flavor I had to ask the server to bring me some spices to season it up. To finish up, we never got out appetizer and they were still going to charge me for it had I not thrown a fit about it!! Stay away from this over priced, nasty tasting food establishment!!"}
{"text":"Been here 4 times. Only got in 2 times
 Posted hours mean nothing. They close when business is slow. First meal they forgot to bring the bread with my meal. Had to ask for it. It came cold. Second time I got there 2 hours befor posted closing time. Bone fragment in my meat sauce. Could not order anything else because they shut down the registers after I had placed my order. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. The staff is super friendly.   The restaurant is also very clean!  I would recommend coming here when in the downtown Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"I came here with my sister and we had a great time. We had a charming server who we thought was probably new and therefore a tad nervous. Cute. 

We shares a large Parmesan French fries and it was way too much for just two people, but they were good. My sister had the Alfredo pasta and it was delicious. I wish I would have ordered that for myself!  I had pasta with a vodka sauce that was good, but couldn't compete with the Alfredo! 

The lights at this place are cool too."}
{"text":"Went here Thursday for a business lunch. Ordered prosciutto & fig pizza with two side salads. The food was good. The service was frustrating. It took 30 minutes to get the salads. After finishing our salads we asked when the pizza would be out. The waitress had put our pizza \"on hold\" until we finished our salads. Who does this?? The entire meal took 1.5 hours. No one has this much time for lunch. I won't be back."}
{"text":"We love this place.  This time around I had the crab linguine in a spicy lobster sauce (minus the asparagus) and my boyfriend had the pasta alfredo with chicken.  As with our previous dinners here, the food was excellent as was the service.  Bridget was helpful and pleasant."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the negative reviews. Granted, I have only been to The Strand once, but I received great service and great food. Their happy hour specials are amazing. I got the best burger I've ever had in Arizona, along with delicious parmesean garlic fries and a beer, all for $10 plus tip. Truly a great deal, especially for happy hour."}
{"text":"Came in right before the Carrie Underwood concert and albeit was busy the waitress was slow in getting to us to take our order. Ordered the Chicken, Artichoke and Bacon Pizza and it came out burnt at the bottom. Would have sent it back but because it took 20 just to get the pizza in the first place and we had somewhere more important to me just ate where we could. Not sure if would come back to here again."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night before a comedy show. Felt very welcome as soon as we walked in.  Had a great waitress who was very friendly and made excellent menu suggestions. My friend and I wanted something light; we ordered Drunken Cheesy bread to start. Delicious. (Ladies Night half prices were a bonus.) The frozen margaritas were also tasty. We shared a chicken parm pizza, which was one of the best pizzas I've ever had.  Between the service and the food, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian Food!!! I found The Strand on Yelp. Thank you fellow Yelpers! I'm relatively new to Phoenix and spoiled by the famous italian food in Little Italy, San Diego... I'll admit I've found some awesome Italian food in Phoenix!

The Strand has traditional, scrum-diddly-umptious Italian Food in Phoenix, Arizona... 1/2 OFF Happy Hour is the best... Bartenders are sweet, great drinks... The lobster mac n cheese is everything you could want. I love seafood pastas and this is probably one of the tastiest dishes at The Strand..

They also cater!!! I was enthralled as I am constantly searching for affordable, amazing, creative caterers... They will be at Search Control's event at the ASBA headquarters, if you're not there for the internet marketing event, you'll be there for The Strand's awesome italian food (:"}
{"text":"Very cute spot in downtown Phoenix. The host could have been friendlier but our server Stephanie was wonderful. I ordered the chicken parmesan, it would good however I still think North Italia's is better. My friend had the penne a la vodka which was \"freakin delicious!\" Definitely stop here if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Why the Hell did you refuse to seat our party of three just now and say \"Oh uh yeah um we're full!\" when there were three open tables right plain as day right before our eyes?!? Who told you this was a good business practice?"}
{"text":"So we got reservations on NYE and I had been wanting to check this place out for quite some time. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it! The decor in the restaurant is nice, makes you wanna just hang out and have some wine and good food. I started with the crispy calamari that was served with two great sauces. The calamari was super tender and crispy, perfectly executed! I ended up going with the Prosciutto and Egg pizza, that was decent. I prefer my pizza more crisp and the eggs over easy. This pizza could have been awesoe, but the crust wasn't nearly crispy enough and the eggs seemed more scrambled. With egg on my pizza, the best part is the runny yoke on the pie, which this lacked. I'll definitely come back and give it another shot. Chalk this up as another win for Cityscape!"}
{"text":"It was just... aight.  

Came here before watching Dave Chappelle perform at Comerica Theatre.  There was also a Phoenix Suns game that same night.  I was surprised that we were seated so promptly given that other restaurants around were majorly busy.  There was a good amount of people there but service was prompt and our waitress wasn't too overbearing.  

Honestly, I don't remember what I ordered only because it was mediocre.  Whatever it was tasted bland... well, more like blahhhh... and for the amount of money we spent, definitely not worth it.

I think this spot has a lot of potential.  I mean, it's in a great location, in the middle of the hustle and bustle of downtown Phoenix but the menu and its items could use some improvement.  I think I'll just stick to Arrogant Butcher next time (right next door)."}
{"text":"I have eaten there once and the food was excellent but i went there yesterday with 12 co-workers and there was big piece of plastic in my salad. I told the server there was plastic in my salad as i was holding it up and she replied \"was it actually in your food\" as i politely responded \"no it was just in mouth from the bite i took from my food\"...I will not be having any more meals there.."}
{"text":"Excellent bolagnase, meatballs, and seafood spaghetti.  The angry shrimp appetizer was nicely spiced.  The service was also good.(James?)we enjoyed eating on the patio."}
{"text":"Don't bother. We were here for an event at Talking Stick Arena. We arrived at 6:00 pm and were seated right away, so we thought,\"great!\"  But we waited, and waited, and waited for 30 minutes. No one approached our table AT ALL!  Yet other tables were being served. Even people that arrived after we did. If I could give it 0 stars, I would."}
{"text":"I was here for a conference and had a night on our own for dinner. Two of my co-workers and I decided on this place. We were able to get a seat outside. It was such a beautiful night so we were very happy about that. Our server was there right away, took our drink orders and was back within minutes with our drinks. We ordered an appetizer for the table and our meals. The services was so great, loved the atmosphere and the food was very good. We told our other co-workers who didn't join us to try it. They did and loved it just as much!"}
{"text":"Ordered the fettuccine and caprese. Very good food and kind service. Will be coming back again. One of the better Italian restaurants for sure in phoenix."}
{"text":"I saw this place because of the awesome decor inside, the chandeliers, color, and  furniture give the place a nice flair! Me and a friend went about 2 weeks ago, we arrived late about 9ish and decided to sit at the bar. The bartender was amazing, she was great, she went over the menu with us and even informed us it was reverse happy hour and suggested some of her own favorite dishes on the menu.

I decided to go with their hamburger with parmesan french fries, yum! Their food portions are well worth it, the hamburger was huge and I got a plate full of fries, also the cheese garlic bread as an appetizer was delicious, not to mention their ice tea was amazing (and I'm a big tea drinker). We stayed quite sometime and I witnessed some guests still coming in close to closing time and the staff still seated them and served them instead of turning them away, that's giving good customer service.

I plan to go back and with friends soon, The Strand rocks in my book! Thank you guys at The Strand for giving me and my tummy a good time! :)"}
{"text":"The two stars are for the good service. NO stars for the food and drinks. Sub-par, to say the least. The sauce tasted canned, the bread was flavorless, the pasta was overdone, the pesto was just weird, and the cocktail tasted like a grocery store mix. Unsatisfying on every level, and an insult to the people who chose to eat there. I imagine it only survives by getting the overflow from the far superior restaurant next door."}
{"text":"Adam, the bartender (manager?) is a great restaurant employee. I wasn't the biggest fan of a small part of my salad. The eggplant was not very good. I ate the rest of my salad, (it was really good minus the eggplant).  Adam was concerned over my experience and offered solutions to make it better.  I left feeling good about my experience and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Veronica was our server and was fabulous for our party of 10!  Separate checks, no problem.  Food was fantastic! Will return if I'm back in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"My family and I wanted to try this place out prior to an event downtown and will not be coming back. The hostess sat us very quickly but that was the only quick thing about this place. The gentlemen next to us noted it took 20 minutes to ask for a drink. We had waited 30 minutes when two other tables were seated. Not once during this time were we greeted by our wait staff and noticed the other tables started placing orders. The waitress even served drinks to the table next to us and still didn't acknowledge us. There were several wait staff so it was not an issue of staff shortage. We left after waiting 30 minutes and like I said, will never come back nor recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Got very sick when I got home. Short ribs & mash potatoes. I'd give it one more visit at another time, but first I need to get my stomach right."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Everything I've ever ordered has been delicious,  comes out hot and is well presented.   It always amazes me that the restaurant \"next door\" will have all the hip diners standing and waiting to get in, while we slip into The Strand, get served immediately sip an enjoyable glass of wine and while our  delightful meal is servef before the hipsters next door even get seated.  It's a gem of a place you should definitely try. Check out the angry shrimp!"}
{"text":"Good food! Located in cityscape. We parked in the parking garage for cityscape then gave our parking ticket to our server and got it validated. Great location! I had the lobster Mac and cheese with bacon, so good! Fantastic service with a good environment. Good prices for the quality of food. Definitely will come back again and eat here before a basketball game."}
{"text":"I work at a location very close to The Strand. I called if they offer discounts to their neighbors (most restaurants downtown do..) and they don't, but I still ordered to go. The Bolognese is good... Maybe two small portions if you want to split it for two lunches. I asked if they could include bread, she said they would but when I opened my order up when I got to my desk, there was no bread. Should have confirmed when I picked it up but would have been nice if they did so without a reminder. It's the small things that matter to me... The taste of the Bolognese is okay, not anything super amazing but it was just shy of $11 for the entree. Also will ask for more sauce next time. So I'll try the take out again but will have to triple check my order at pick up."}
{"text":"Food looks better than it taste. Hmmm where do i start....

The \"free bread\" was untoasted,  cold and flavorless. It was served with okay flavored pesto. We wish the bread was warm and toasted like most places in Texas. 

Okay well we came in right before closing around 930pm and they close at 10pm. We were swated right away because no one else was in there. The waitress was very nice and sweet. We placed our drink orders and i had a house maragarita and my wife had a Chardonnay. She is an advid wine drinker and thought the Chardonnay was not good. She liked my Margarita but i did not. Too sweet and not enough Twang. 

On to the food. I had the Chicken Alla Vodka pasta.  Looked really good but subpar at best. Had to add tons of salt and black pepper to get some reminiscence of flavor. My wife had the chicken and broccli Alfredo pasta in which the pasta comes plain and you have to add Chicken and Broccoli  at an addtional cost. She too had to add salt and pepper to make it edible. As dar as freshness the chicken on both our dishes were skinny and looked like the chicken was frozen when added to our dishes. The chicken WAS firm and tasted like freezer. My wifes broccoli tasted like Hospital veggies or even the steamables that you buy from walmart. 

LONG STORY SHORT MY WIFE ENDED UP SICK AND NAUSEOUS FROM THIS PLACE. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. ONLY REASON FOR THE 2 STAR IS BECAUSE OF THE NICE WAITRESS. Nice atmosphere i guess"}
{"text":"The food wasn't the most exquisite I've ever had, but everything else makes up for it. The ambience is great. It's chic and cute, but not to where I don't feel like I don't fit in. Drinks are super affordable ($8 for their version of a Long Island... Awesome). They played kickass music, which always helps. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is my chicken Parmesan wasn't crispy. But even their bread sticks were amazing. Everything else was amazing. We will be back."}
{"text":"So I would like to first start this review off by saying that the food and the wait staff and even the manager who i had to speak to, not by my request, are very pleasant and worth coming back to. The only issue I had at this location was with the hostess who i had an unfortunate incident with. First they dont take reservations which is fine, i get it, second they have no way of letting people who check in for a table know that their table is ready which is not of this age. We arrive and are told that our wait is 25 min which again is fine. We literally step inside the restaurant next door and come back in 7 min to find that our name was called and our table was taken..which is weird because they made no effort to find us. I then asked the hostess, a young girl, how long are wait was going to be and she literally said \"i dont know\" . My next words to her were \"as a hostess you should typically know how long the wait is\". Fast forward to her telling me she didnt like my tone to her going to get her manager and then the manager asking me why his hostess was crying in the back about a disgruntled customer. 

i was not disgruntle and it is the hostess responsibility aka job to know this information. The manager i could tell agreed with me as he simply got us sat down in the next 5 min with no further issue and again the food, the waiter were great. 

if your going to have a hostess please make sure she is emotionally stable and can handle her job."}
{"text":"My office ended up choosing The Strand to have our post holiday luncheon here. I've been here before and never had an issue until now. There were 11 of us who were able to make the reservation we made in advance. When I made the reservation with specifics the host said they can accommodate our needs. We had two tables. At the table I was sitting at we had no issues. I told the waitress that we had previously asked if separate checks were fine and that we were doing that. She said ok no problem. I've had the lobster mac and cheese there which is delicious. I wanted to try something new this time. I opted for the pomodoro. When my food arrived it look delicious because it was plated so well. First bite no so good...it was very much flavorless! I had to add lots of salt. I had a few of the other women try it and they said it was very bland! We noticed our other table seem to be having problems but couldn't tell what was going on. After our lunch I asked one of the ladies how her lunch was. She said her meat came out burnt on the salad and the other women's lunch were not good either. Their chicken was cold and the noodles were over cooked. She then began to tell me that the waitress stared to bring out their bill without asking if they wanted anything else. They told the waitress they wanted to order dessert. That didn't sit well with the waitress as she began to cop an attitude with them. After that she brought the bills again and this time the bills were wrong. When they brought it to her attention she told them \"separate checks are a privilege\". She was really rude to them. When we were leaving I asked the waitress why she would say the comment about separate checks. She blew up at me as if it were my fault. I told her that the restaurant had no issues with doing separate checks as I had previously cleared that. She stared yelling at me then rudely threw her hands in my face and snubbed me! I asked for my bill back to remove her tip for what she had just done to me as I didn't appreciate it! She threw the bills down in front of me and told me to find it! I did and I removed my tip! She continued to yell and throw her hands in my face! While all of this was going on there was a man standing next to us working behind the bar. He was witnessing the entire incident go down. All he said was \"that's enough\". I'm not sure who he was saying that to. I walked out pissed! My coworker called the restaurant to speak with the manager. He got on the phone and introduced himself by the name Adam. Come to find out that was the man/ manager who was witnessing the incident and not stopping his employee from acting the way she did! Great managing skills Adam! To top it off he also said the \"waitress\" we we had who was rude and the one yelling at me was also a manager! I would put her name on here but she refused to give me her name. Adam continued to tell my coworker that she walked out and quit! Good! Someone like that who treats customers the way she did doesn't need to represent a restaurant in my opinion! Overall I give this restaurant a bad rating due to the horrible customer service and bland tasting food! Would never go back! Would never recommend to anyone! Much better places downtown to eat at!"}
{"text":"So I should say that I was told that this place was like an Italian Pei Wei style type of restaurant, i.e. fast casual. But, two months ago they did decide to provide full dinner service which I really appreciated! Great location and loved the decor. 

We ordered the chicken parmesan pizza and the lobster mac and cheese. Pizza was underwhelming, and chicken was a bit dry. But the lobster mac and cheese was really good! Definitely rich and greasy though, so not the best for calorie conscious days. 

Overall, it's alright. I think I would rather come back for the happy hour menu than do the full dinner service."}
{"text":"Came for dinner and the staff was friendly. Food was mediocre at best. We had the chicken parm and the marinara sauce was watery.  Also had the chicken piccata which had no real flavor. The garlic mashed potatoes was the best thing on my plate."}
{"text":"Food and service were good, I work front desk at a local hotel. I will continue to recommend our guests here :)"}
{"text":"Mediocre. 

Service: We came on Sunday during lunch time and they were very much understaffed. Our waiter was running back and forth and was visibly stressed. He never introduced himself or asked to take our drink order. We only had water with our lunch. He also barely checked on us. 

Food: BLAND. I ordered their lobster mac and cheese and was surprised we did not get bread with our order. The entree itself was nothing special a bit dry and desperately in need of flavor. My husband had the burger. Though he ordered it medium well, it was very dry. Even the sweet potato fries needed more seasoning!

Decorations: They had some pretty interesting light fixtures.

With the many wonderful places in downtown Phoenix, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I have visited The Strand about 2 years ago when I lived in Phoenix. I liked it then, the food was good. Now visiting for vacation, I decided to bring my group along. I was disappointed walking through the door. The restaurant has not changed a bit. The decor is great. It's modern and confortable. I have no problem with that and I throughly enjoy it. The menu is exactly the same though, and I wanted to see something new and fresh. Deciding between rosemary salmon and pasta, I choose the pasta because in Seattle, we can get fresh salmon everywhere. I would love to see a fresh sheet, or just something different. We ordered the bruschetta as an appetizer and it was delish. Also fast. My pasta and my partners lobster mac came out quickly as well, which makes me worry about buyout ingredients. The food is good. However, the table next to us ordered butternut squash ravioli and we're saying it was cold. 

Drink wise, the wine list is okay. Nothing to rave about. I didn't see a rosè and I was kind of craving that. Settled for a reisling. My partner ordered a sangria. Waters seemed very tap tasting and unfiltered.

My biggest complaint would be with the staff. Not necessarily the quality of service, but the complete lack of class. The female servers are all in extremely short and tight skirts and lots of cleavage. Not our cup of tea. For a moment I thought the Tilted Kilt upstairs would have more class. The guys on the kitchen, although they look like they know what they're doing, I would rather see chef coats on instead of tshirts and ballcaps. Our server Jessica was nice. I would personally pay a bit more if the staff cleaned up a bit and the ingredients seemed not as bought (aka my pasta, croutons).

Overall, I liked my food but the other detractors really killed my mood. Perhaps this is what the local clientele are into, but it's not for me. This place has a ton of potential. Edit: no yelp check-in bonus: sad face."}
{"text":"Nom, nom, nom!!!! So good! Never had a bad meal! Everything is amazeballs. My favorite is the steak and kale salad. Last week I tried one of the pastas cuz they always look so good when I see them go by. Again they surpassed my expectations. We ALWAYS get the calamari and it's THA BOMB! I love this place. I can't say enough good things. The service is always great, food is spectacular, and it's just easy and fun and accessible. Love it!"}
{"text":"Love eating here!  They totally cater to your diet!  Served up a dish that wasn't on the menu, but dished it up for me anyway!!  Yum!  Adam, the manager, is the very best at providing quality service to his customers!  He cares about the quality of the food he serves!"}
{"text":"ok, I have serious reservations about this place, food wise and service wise. Considering their location, they should be way, way better prepared for crowds. This was horrible service for a order, and sit down and be served kind of place.
None of the servers knew what was going on with their tables. My boyfriend canceled part of his order after wait 35 minutes for it. I would of loved to have canceled mine, since they couldn't nail the whole concept of put the cold meat balls in the microwave longer, even on the second try.
The table next to us was complaining up a storm for the same reason.
I kept waiting for my boyfriends' meal to come out, so we could eat together, it never came out. He ate part of my cold meal , and we left hungry, that is after he stood in line for 15 minutes to get his entree taken off the bill. I ordered the primavera, it sounded better than it tasted, the meatballs might of been good , but they were so cold they didn't have a great deal of taste. Would have to be desperate and see no crowd to ever go back there again."}
{"text":"Went here before a show at Stand Up live. The happy hour had blue moon's for $2!! The frozen margaritas are our favorite! I got the Chicken Parm which I think was better than Carrabba's. Wife got a burger for some reason but said she loved it a little better than Joe's Farm Grill. We had a great time with an attentive waiter. We can't wait to go back. 

PARKING TIP: Eating at a restaurant gives you a two hr validation while stand up live gives a three hr window. We only parked for less than 5hrs but they will only accept one block of hrs for free so we had to pay $5. The way to avoid it would be to pull out of garage and then right back in to get a new parking pass for the comedy show."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Had the crab linguini which was the daily special it was just ok. Would have liked to been offered bread or salad. Plus no real cheese sprinkled on the pasta... The kid liked the meatball & strands. Next time i'll try the drunken bread, lobster Mac and fig bruschetta."}
{"text":"First time in Phoenix friend took us there. Very nice, some traditional Italian dishes. I had the Chicken Alfredo. My wife had Chicken Marsala. Our server was Adrianna and did a great job. Would go there again."}
{"text":"The Strand drew my attention when I first saw it and promised I would come back because it seemed interesting. The best part of the visit was the fact that our waiter was nice enough to stamp on my receipt to validate my parking because I lost my ticket from the parking garage below the restaurant (CityScape). He was very accommodating and unfortunately that's about how good the experience was here. 

The spaghetti with meatballs and balsamic vinegarette salad were horrible. The spaghetti tasted border-line elementary school cafeteria-ish, cheap and bland. Honestly, I felt like Oregano's spaghetti is better! Yes, I preferred a major chain over this. 

The salad was luke warm, wilted and soggy. It made me wonder if this was left under the heat lamp with the spaghetti. The cheese pizza was gobbled by my 3 year old, so I'm glad he enjoyed himself quite well.

The rating would be lower if it wasn't for the great attitude of the waiter, but the food alone will not get me back."}
{"text":"We went here last night after the Symphony and it was okay. They told us when we walked in that they were no longer serving dinner, only appetizers, salads, and pizza, which was fine with us: my wife wanted a salad and I wanted pizza. 

We sat on the patio and our waitress was right over to take our drink orders, and then back a few minutes later with our wine. My wife ordered the salmon salad, and I had the chicken pizza. The waitress came back a few minutes later to report that they were out of salmon, so she ordered the pear salad. 

Our food came, and although the pizza looked good, it was just okay. The big slice of chicken breast on the pizza made it hard to eat...maybe shredded chicken would be easier. The pizza was warm, but not hot enough to give you that little blister on the roof of your mouth. I didn't eat the last two slices because they were cold after I'd eaten the first four. My wife's salad was fine, although she remarked that there were a lot of greens and not as much \"good stuff.\"

I don't know that I'd say to my wife, \"Hey, let's drive downtown and mess around with parking and go to the Strand,\" but as a casual place within walking distance of Symphony Hall it was fine. We'd probably go back."}
{"text":"My Bestie and I were attending a concert recently (Steely Dan!), and, as we often do, we opted to stay at Hotel Palomar, which is within walking distance of the venue. I learned of The Strand while searching the worldwide interweb for dinner plans.

We arrived about 5:15 on a Tuesday, so it was not at all crowded. It did, however, mostly fill up while we were there.

The calamari was okay, but I would not place it in my Top 3. Not bad, just not shout-worthy. The Angry Shrimp was excellent and not too spicy in our opinions. The seafood linguine was delicious! Mussels and scallops and shrimp (oh, my!) were not over- or under-cooked, and the pasta was terrific. We opted for a bottle of Cabernet / Merlot / Syrah ('Super Tuscan') which was just right. Kudos to Ashley for outstanding service.

We're going to another concert in about a week, and I'm pretty sure I know where dinner will be...."}
{"text":"WOW! This place is great! From the vibe to the dessert, I have NO complaints!
The drinks were amazing and the bartender was great. The Lobster Mac n Cheese and Chicken alla Vodka were incredible! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Happy hour on a sat!! i'm a fan!! 

Cold beer, blue moons for  2 :)
half price appetizers calamari really good 
to finish off yummy chicken pizza
and validates parking!!
really nice place, really cute for a day night or a girls night out! 
clean and stylish and great service!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. The hostess (red head) took down a list of people due to a busy night (something that normal restaurants do) as soon as she was overwhelmed with people coming up to the host stand complaining about wait times she abandoned the list and would seat the pushiest people of the group. I'm not one to write reviews about restaurants, but this was extremely irritating and we ended up walking away after trying to be the patient ones. Don't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Definitely a four star restaurant. Amazing decor greets you upon entrance. Don't miss the espresso and margarita drinks available frozen for $6.00. They are served with Boba large straws and have some fun floaty treats, yay! :) Yes, there's still a kid inside of me that loves to discover new flavors through a straw (or wait is that the old person inside of me?Ew.) 

The LUNCH was amazing! You have your sandwiches; meatball and chicken parm, and served w/ choice of fries or salad. We had the best of both worlds and it was almost too much for two to share, but still, very good flavors and fresh ingredients. 

We really enjoyed our time. A Stella that was served in the appropriate glass finished off our Satuday Funday, as the frozen drinks for $6 were very good. Not to sound cheap, because their wine menu was great, and they have a full bar, seemingly a perfect place for drinks with friends or more fancy times-- but this was lunch. 

I will be back, maybe just for the really great decor and frozen drinks, but the food shouldn't be missed either. Nice spot to know about in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Oh the strand! I honestly have mixed feelings about this place but I keep coming back. The pastas are not heavy, some of them are not that great and just seem to be put together quickly without thought. The mussels and clam appetizer is amazing and is honestly the reason why I keep coming back. The waitress will only give you free bread if you ask for it. They have some good items it's just hit and miss. The service is Ok. Never really had a problem except for the bread part."}
{"text":"We recently hosted our daughter's baptismal reception at The Strand; the food, service and ambience were more than we could've asked for. The staff had displayed our minimal decor and even arranged for a separate dessert/gift table without us even asking for it. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive. Most importantly, the food and drinks were great! The menu was served family style as we were 75 people. We had margherita pizzas, calamari, bruschetta, balsamic and caprese salads, bolognese, alfredo with chicken, smoked gouda and vegetable ravioli and chicken picatta. Considering the majority of our guests are Sicilian, they can be tough food critics when it comes to eating Italian food but everyone was very complimentary! The owner, Adam, even made the scheduling and planning process very easy. Thanks again Adam to you and your staff for a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"By far one of the poorest restaurants in the area. They told me that since I am twenty five years of age and have valid out of state drivers license that I am unable to purchase liquor because it is not horizontal. They said this was Arizona state law, which it is not. If you are going to refuse service at least know your laws. The food is poorly composed and is in massive portions. Would never return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick meal before a show. Fun decor, brand new and sparkling clean, with a nice sized menu. We chose this restaurant because it advertised gluten free pasta. Unfortunately, no one on staff seemed to know what \"gluten free\" meant. When we asked which sauces might be GF to go with the GF pasta, we were met with blank stares. It took several questions to determine that the marinara sauce \"might\" be GF -not very confidence inspiring. When we did get our meals, everything tasted fine, not fabulous, about on par with a Pei Wei type experience. I had a small side house salad, which was not on the menu, but was offered by the girl at the register.  The greens were nice, but not chilled, which was kind of yucky.  The balsamic vineagrette was not able to be GF certified, so I had it on the side.  It was just OK.  My GF pasta was cooked properly, and the portion was large but not too large.  I had the primavera with marinara sauce, and while the veggies seemed fresh, they were a tad overcooked.  My husband had a pizza, seemed to be pretty good.  My daughter had a kids meal of chicken tenders and fries--the tenders were a chicken breast cut into slices, which worked, and the fries were a tad bit reminiscent of Burger King's, with some parmesan thrown on top.  The kid's meal also came with mini donuts, which we had to ask for 3 times, but there were fresh out of the fryer and covered in cinammon sugar--yummy.  We ordered ice cream with a GF chocolate chip cookie--and what arrived was definitely not a \"cookie\"--more like a gluey, gooey chocolate chip amoeba at the bottom of a dish with 2 scoops of ice cream on top.  Eh.

I tried to order an espresso machiato at the coffee bar in back of the restauant--the coffee girl didn't know the correct way to make the drink, so I opted for a soy cappucino--this was tasty and well done.


This is clearly a new business still working out the kinks. I think it's a good option if you're in downtown PHX and need a quick, decent meal."}
{"text":"I am in Phoenix on business and thought I would stop into The Stand for \"Linner\" (lunch and dinner ;-p ) . The atmosphere is clean and modern , has nice booth seating and was comfortable. It has a lot of ambiance potential :)  I came in around 4p so maybe down time for them??  However it is downtown near a lot of hotels and such so I'm sure they are used to it. I mean HH!?!? 
Ok so this is probably something that bothers me more than most BUT I am all about atmosphere and ambiance....A nice Italian restraunt and COUNTRY music on the radio, LOL! Like super countryfied Country!!  Really killed the vibe and made me question how serious they are about their establishment..... I know, I know, sounds EXTREMLY nit- picking of me AND I am from Texas! I love country music but I made me feel like I was invading their down time and that managers jam or whatever ! ALSO the menu is exclusively  Italian so??!?? 
  Ok so past the music thingy. The  waiter brought bread and some sort of pesto sauce for dipping. It was very vinegary, I didn't care for it, olive oil is preferable to me,  but bread was good.  
Under my waiters suggestion I tried the Chicken Piccata. It was pretty flavorable and nice size portion...very \"rich\" I would say, but chicken looked kinda slimy under piccata sauce. I ate half then lost my appetite. 
My server was nice, probably the manager because he had regular clothes on. 
Overall I would probably give it another try, maybe at night time when they are hopefully more prepared for guests and try something else on the menue."}
{"text":"Another trendy spot with not so hot food.  We had the Lobster Mac and Cheese and the Pancetta Pasta with sweet peas both were really bland.  The rice ball appetizer with two dipping sauces was delightful however.  

This may be better spot for drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I both work in restaurants, and we always try not to be too picky and judgmental when we go out. That being said, I feel like we haven't had the best experiences eating out since moving to Phoenix two years ago. After a friend came here for his anniversary and raved about it, we decided to give it a try. We cook a lot of Italian food at home and weren't sure what to expect. Holy cow were we blown away. We were greeted immediately at the door by the hostess who sat us at a clean spacious table on the patio. The waitress came over promptly with waters and took our drink order. The owner, Ross, came over and turned on a heater for us just as it was getting a little chilly. Our drinks and appetizers arrived quickly and our entrees came out shortly after. I got the Alfredo and added meatballs (maybe a little weird, I don't care!) while my boyfriend got the chicken alla vodka. Our food was phenomenal and the portions were generous. We so look forward to coming back here and I will be recommending The Strand to everyone."}
{"text":"Small and tight seating arrangements. I ordered the primodoro and found it to be of good portion size. I found the taste delicious. I did not like the atmosphere or the size of the establishment, that is why i provided a 3 star rating. I think the menu choices were decent. My meal was good."}
{"text":"Good food, service a little slow.  Vodka pasta was good and the salmon was tasty.  Angry shrimp also tasty, although they should use larger shrimp.  Location is perfect next to the stadiums."}
{"text":"This place had some good Meatballs. Nice little place in the downtown cityscape. My belly is so happy with it's life"}
{"text":"We love this place! A great spot for lunch or dinner downtown. The food is always delicious, the complimentary bread and pesto in the beginning is a nice touch, and we've never been disappointed here. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit and we were just as pleased as the first time. We were seated immediately and our waitress was ready for us. 

We started with the clams & mussels and they are so good I could drink the broth! I decided to have the wedge salad and it was a perfect portion. My husband had the baked Mac and cheese and he thought it was delicious. 

There were plenty of seats when we arrived but it was filling up as we were leaving, around 8:30pm. 

We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting Phoenix and just stumbled into this restaurant. Friendly staff, awesome food, reasonably priced!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night with 3 friends and let's just say the experience was not the best. Either the calamari was not prepared right, or my stomach all of a sudden does not like seafood. The calamari gave me a horrible stomach bug. The crab linguine was room temperature and not hot but if it had more heat it would have been amazing. The waiter did not smile and all most seemed it was a issue serving us. Maybe he was having a bad day. Last thing that irritated my friends was that 4 girls were staring at us while we were waiting for our food. We looked over the smiled and then turned away. Keep in mind these are employees. Overall decent food would not go back again."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner on a Thursday evening. My wife had the pasta with meatballs. My daughter had the Lobster Mac-N-Cheese. She enjoyed it very much.

I had the Seafood Linguine. The pasta was made with squid ink. It was black and was incredible. You need to go and try this dish. That is the dish I will have next time we go. Don't let the idea of squid ink throw you. I does not taste like you were sucking on the end of a pen. It adds a subtle sweetness to the dish. Try it and let me know what you think.

Great place for pasta downtown."}
{"text":"Felicia, Felicia, Felicia...

The best service I've had in Phoenix to date. I told Felicia what I normally drink, she shook her head approvingly and walked to the bar, came back with several originals for me to partake of. 

They stayed open late for us! Im sure she had better things to do. ..


Sidenote:

When I walked in I saw 4 skateboarders at the bar. 
Apparently, they work there, so, yeah, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love the pear salad. Pizzas are good too. I have always had good service. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Waitress was unable to tell us about happy hour specials.  We had to ask her to ask someone.   Ordered the Clams & Mussel appetizer and there was hardly any meat. Upon receiving check, our appetizer was not discounted for happy hour.   We were told it was because we ordered off the lunch menu. So, be careful about the happy hour pricing.  
They have a creamy pesto sauce for the bread which is  phenomenal!
I ordered the qenua dish and there wasn't any seasoning so it was blah.  The Chicken Marsala dish was wonderful.
There was some funky, artsy,  tube-like,  coiled lighting above each table.   Ours had bugs trapped in it....we didn't look up to see until we were leaving, otherwise we would have asked for another table."}
{"text":"It started a bit rough, however, John (not sure if he is the manager?) made this experience worth it! 

For being downtown near major venues, especially during the holiday season, we expected it to be busy. But we did not expect the service to literally forget & neglect us. We opted to sit on the patio, it being less crowded. However- once we were sat, we sat for 30+ minutes without anything but menus. No water. Multiple servers were attending tables around us... we got up to walk out. 

John happened to stop us, and was MORE than helpful/attentive. Had it not been for him, we would have left. Just needing a brief but decent meal before our show, we were able to have some delicious small plates- the food is GREAT! Butternut squash ravioli was the best I have ever had. 


But still, throughout the entire experience- John was the only reason this place gets the stars it does, along with the food. Not at ALL impressed with how rude the rest of the wait staff was, literally ignoring us, visually noticing us sitting there making eye contact attempting to get at least a glass of water! None of the 3 ladies standing at the hostess station did much besides point to the patio & say, \"sorry we are busy someone will eventually be with you\". The staff, besides John, needs some serious instruction on customer service. 

But thank you to the kitchen for some excellent dishes, and most thanks to John! Really appreciate his effort in turning the experience around & genuinely caring for his customers. We all understand how hectic weekend evenings can be, especially during the holiday season, but this was one of the first times I have actually gotten up to walk out from a place- so we want to make sure John receives highest compliments because the food was great & HE made the difference between a total flop. 

I'd really like to return & try more of the menu- the food is absolutely great with a decent variety, plenty to choose from as well as reasonably priced. I just can't say I am eager to immediately return after the major lack of customer service. Please take some notes from John- total pro & saved the evening/review!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch-  we had a great experience.  Tasha was very friendly  and welcoming.  A fun place to dine or just having a couple  of cocktails. My favorite new place!"}
{"text":"Service is slow!  Food is decent. I had the caramelized pear salad with grilled shrimp, it was decent."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour...1/2 price appetizers and great drink specials.  The $5 martinis were great and well mixed - definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"We accidentally ended up at The Strand when our first choice down the street had an hour wait for a table for two. What a glorious find! Fast & friendly service, delicious food. We had the angry shrimp, which was shrimp cooked perfectly in a spicy Italian marinara sauce, served with warm, lightly toasted bread. The spaghetti and meatballs were delicious as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to The Strand. It was a Saturday night. Dead. Service was ok although the waitress couldn't tell me the dessert menu offhand (out of only four items). Most were store bought, not freshly made. I had the seafood linguine. Not good at all. The pasta clearly tasted old and my first bite of clam contained a gritty hunk of sand. The sauce was disappointing. Not flavorful. It was spicy and that's about it. For $18 I expected much better quality. The kicker came at the end when I was asked about the meal. I told the woman it was just ok and listed all the reasons why. She said she would send the manager. He came over and didn't want to hear what was wrong with the dinner which was really surprising. I heard the staff will be completely changed, but I won't be coming back. The Strand is strung out!"}
{"text":"Meh. Ordered the pizza. It wasn't as good as I would have hoped for the price. Drinks were acceptable but overpriced."}
{"text":"Very cute concept...but unfortunately that is the only good thing I can say.  4 of us went for dinner prior to a Suns game and they could not handle the crowd.  This is a fast casual Italian concept - order at the counter, find a table and they bring the food to you - should be in and out.  We waited 20 or so minutes in line and then grabbed a table.  Another 30 minutes passed before the first entree was delivered.  Another 20 minutes later two more entrees arrived and 5 minutes later we received the final entree.  Unfortunately the food was mediocre at best.  We had a 12\" pepperoni pizza, two orders of ravioli with creamy tomato sauce (the ravioli on one order had hard edges) and the chicken saltimbocca.   It was edible, it was fine, but it's not worth further description.  

There were many, very unhappy customers and very little effort by management to assuage anyone.  While on the subject of management, you would think that in crisis mode you would see all hands on deck in hustle mode, however that was not at all the case.  There was a manager and another employee just standing at the counter and looking around toward the end of the rush while a few customers were waiting for food and tables.  The table next to us vacated and it was 20 minutes before it was bussed.  Bizarre.

We overheard a manager (I think)  talking to some other customers and explaining that this is the third time they've experienced this kind of service break down at dinner due to the crowd.  Really?  You are a hop and a skip from US Airways Arena.  I'm pretty sure your business model was banking on that when the location was chosen.  However after two previous dinner service failures it didn't occur to you to check the downtown calendar, staff up and fix any other issues on the line?

I really wanted to like this place.  Big time fail."}
{"text":"This wasn't my first time going to strand. With good experiences in the past it seemed to make sense to go back on a Friday. The hostess was polite and seated us promptly. The server stopped by shortly later to take or drink orders(and we put in for the drunken cheesy bead appetizer due to happy hour ending shortly.) The drunken cheesy bread was meh, but our entrees were very good. I had the chicken something or another that the server recommended and it was the best dish of the bunch. I would recommend strand to anyone. The drinks were very tasty and strong without tasting strong. The atmosphere is nice as well."}
{"text":"In had the meatballs and strands (spaghetti). This place is awesome. The sauce is a little spicy, but I really really like it like that. I thought it made the sauce excellent. Meatball was amazing! It could have been that it was cooking in sauce all day because I came at 9 PM so it was tender, whatever it was by far it was the best meatball I have had in years. Staff was supper friendly and nice. Even as it approached closing time there was never an inkling of rush, very attentive. Highly recommended if you are downtown -- it's worth it."}
{"text":"Very hip place right across from the diamondback stadium in downtown Phoenix. The place was packed on a Saturday night with a 45 min wait so i recommend you make reservations. My group of 6 was perfectly happy to sit at the bar. The bartender greeted us right away and asked if we wanted to sample anything after helping us narrow our selections of wine. Immediately after getting our drinks a very friendly server got our orders. We ordered appetizers but unfortunately everything came out at the same time (you may want to specify that apps come out first!). I ordered prosciutto, risotto and ricotta fried puffs that were delicious with the 2 dipping sauces as an appetizer which i shared with my friend. I also shared the veggie pizza, which was nothing to write home about. The toppings all slid off the pizza and the crust was bland. All in all i would give the atmosphere and the bartenders 4 stars but the service and the food maybe a 2. So ho to The Strand and order some drinks and an appetizer then head over to another restaurant nearby for the main course."}
{"text":"My colleague and I decided to have dinner here as it had a varied menu and was right around the corner from our hotel. We had the bruschetta, balsamic salads, beef tortellini and lobster mac and cheese.

The bruschetta was flavorful and the right size for an appetizer and the salads were well balanced albeit a bit heavy on the dressing. The beef tortellini was perfectly cooked and the sage cream sauce was rich. The kitchen was also quite accommodating when we asked to add in some additional veggies to the tortellini. The.lobster mac and cheese was very cheesy and cream and there was a generous helping of lobster and bacon which was pleasantly surprising. The entree sizes were large and we had a hard time finishing them, though we wanted to eat it all.

The bar, on the other hand, left a bad taste on our mouth, literally. To start off the meal, my colleague ordered a sparkling water offered on the menu. The bottle she got was flat so she asked for the correct one. The waitress/hostess went to consult the bartender and came back with a new bottle of the same stuff claiming that was the sparkling water. We should have just given up then. However, we ventured to order a glass of pinot noir and a strawberry tessarosa martini. The wine was awful! It smelled and tasted sour as if it had been left sitting out too long without a cork and turned bad. And the martini tasted like watered down cranberry juice at the top and then became straight vodka at the bottom. There was also long muddled strawberries or basil in the drink as the description promised. Luckily our waitress/hostess was nice enough to take the glass of wine off the tab but I don't know how the bartender got the job.

Three star review because the food was delicious but the bar and service left something to be desired. They were understaffed that night though so I'll let them slide and the hostess coffee her best job."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here tonight to try something new. We were not impressed. I was hoping the zucchini appetizer would have been made fresh, but it seems it comes pre-made. I got the fettuccine alfredo with chicken, it wasn't great but ok. My husband got spaghetti and meatballs. About an hour after we ate, he got an upset stomach. :-("}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I waited 45 minutes for our food to come out after ordering. People who came in 20+ minutes after us were receiving their food before ours ever came out. No apology or compensation was given for the food arriving so late. The angry shrimp appetizer was delicious but our main dishes, pasta and pizza, were mediocre at best. Will not come back."}
{"text":"Great friendly place in downtown Phoenix food and drink is reasonable and nice atmosphere! 
Staff was friendly service was very good 
The food was not 4star but very good and better than average!
I would go back for sure 

Enjoy,"}
{"text":"Great service, good atmosphere, decent food. The chicken parm was soggy, Alfredo not very creamy, but the flavors were good. It was not a \"wow\" and not be my first choice to go in the future, but I would eat a meal here again."}
{"text":"I found this place on the Urban Spoon a whole ago and this is the second time I visited here. I'm glad I found this nice little place.

It's a very hip and urban setting. The menu is very simple and not at all overwhelming. The staff is... Somewhat friendly. They can certainly work on being a little more friendly.

I ordered the linguini pomodoro which was really good. Before each meal, there's bread to snack on. The food came out really quick (I did, however, come a little after they opened). The waitress, Emily, was a sweet lady and made sure I was taken cared of, had water in my glass, and didn't make me feel rushed. The first time I came here, the waitress gave me my bill practically when my meal came. Emily didn't make me feel rushed and I actually got to order dessert.

The only thing that needs to change is the friendliness of the staff. They seem to look bored and would rather be any where else but there and it makes me feel sort of guilty for bothering them. Otherwise, great food and great drinks."}
{"text":"Service was very friendly and laughed at all my jokes! I got the Old Negroni to drink which is very strong and a preferred taste, but I loved it. To eat I had the Crab Linguini which changed my life, it's very savory and spicy, AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Not the best Italian available, but definitely worth the price. Went here when I was 16 with my parents and found myself at a late lunch date yesterday.

The menu hadn't noticeably changed, atmosphere was still just as beautiful, and the lobster mac and cheese was the same great taste as 2 and a half years before.

Staff was very quick and courteous, not very animated but it fits the atmosphere. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"The lobster mac and cheese was the best I have had in a really long time.  My husband had the burger and said that it was ok.

It took quite some time to place our order, but we did have over 20 people with us and no reservation late on a weekday.

I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Worse time ever. Asked for table they said 10 mins. Got drinks at the bar. 20 mins later no table. Asked and got seated outside. No service for 15 mins after! Lame 0 zero stars."}
{"text":"I do not typically write reviews but I was extremely disappointed with this place. To be short and sweet, you can find better, a lot better. They were surprisingly short staffed for a Saturday night (after a Mercury game & Dbacks game!) so we waited a long time for our food. We both ordered pizzas. My crust was completely burnt. When I told the waitress, she merely took it away and did not offer me anything else!!! Horrible, horrible service. All in all, don't waste your time here. You deserve better"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with interesting lights (look like white jellyfish). Got a Chicken piccata which was delicious. TVs were conveniently placed so we were able to watch the World Series Games. Overall, a fun place to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"We went here Tuesday night and what a special treat! 

Our server was such a doll. It was a busy night and she was attentive, smiled at us and took our jokes with grace. Nothing beats a server with a great personality and attitude when it's a busy night. I just wish I could remember her name!

Their parmesan french fries and  tiramisu are amazing by the way! 

I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Call me strange, but The Strand is just not my forte.  I ended up there on a Friday night.  It was full of eaters and teething toddlers.  I'm just saying it was surprising to see that many tiny tots out on a Friday night! I guess I got a different vibe during the Wine Walk when the place was crawling with happy winers! Their menu was not impressive and the drinks were not memorable."}
{"text":"The Strand...The Strand... oh boy I had high hopes for this place because of the location and just the overall ambiance of the place. After searching on Yelp for some Italian places in the area my co workers and I all agreed on The Strand. Within walking distance from the Kimpton Palomar we took a short walk down to have a nice dinner.

Upon arriving, there was not a soul in sight and we were greeted immediately from the host who was pretty nice. I'm not sure if they aren't really use to large parties but a group of 13 we thought wasn't that bad. Our server was super sweet and she was i luck of having a party of this size on her first day. 

After taking all of our drink orders we all collectively were sold on the frozen house margaritas! I mean how can you turn down a $5 drink deal? When they came out they were packed with some punch that's for sure! When it came to our food it was a different story.. now granted I know our party size was considered large but the time frame we had to wait for it was a bit excessive especially due to the fact that nobody was even in the place when we first arrived. Once food started coming out we had a ton of wrong orders and missing items you name it. 

Nobody ordered anything that could've been labeled as difficult so we weren't too sure how the hiccups in the kitchen were even happening. My dish in particular was one that consisted of a quinoa salad and salmon on top. When I received it, there was no salmon and my co worker who ordered chicken in her Alfredo didn't get any chicken lol like huh?! 

Baffled as we were I had to request the manager because it was a bit insane how we had to wait the length of time that we did and to have the stuff come out all wrong. After the manager apologized we received the things that we didn't originally and the night went on. When the checks came that was another process and that Topic i will digress on."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I walked in and was greeted by not only stunning, charismatic & friendly host. She was absolutely a doll. Was seated immediately with place settings & menus & water on the table.  Now this is service. Was greeted by my waitress very attentive & gave me quite a few options was really great. I ordered the calamari & guest ordered the zucchini. The zucchini was tasty the calamari was ok. Then we had the carmalized pear salad w/chicken OMG!. Loved it. My mom had the meatballs spaghetti, chicken parmigiana was to live for everything else was really great. I highly recommend this place. I definitely will go back."}
{"text":"After enjoying several drinks at Lustre Bar, upstairs at Hotel Palomar, my friends, Aura C., Floyd C., and Linda, all were super hungry and decided to hit this place up to take care of that problem.
What attracted me to this place? Something totally unrelated to food. The crazy looking noodle type chandeliers hanging from the ceiling! There were at least a dozen of them and you could spot them while driving by to find parking. I guess if you look at them from another angle, they could also look like jelly fish as I was told, but regardless, I was intrigued.

We asked to be sat on the patio since the evening weather was so pleasant, so they set up a table for 6 just in case a couple of more friends joined us. Little did we know that instead of 2 extra people, about 10-15 friends spotted us on the patio and ended up joining us! Although this was exciting for us, the restaurant was definitely not ready to accomodate this many people on a random weeknight, so the service was pretty slow.  I would give them notice next time to be fair, since there was already another big group inside being served.

As everyone enjoyed their drinks, Aura and I shared the Lobster Mac and Cheese. We loved this dish so much! We will return to order this again! Linda ordered the calamari to munch on, and that was also very good! Those are the only two things we tried though, so I'm curious to know what the other food is like since the Lobster Mac and Cheese was so addicting!

Kudos to The Strand for being so accomodating on short notice! I like your stylish decor and the tasty appetizers!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times. Always walked by because it looked pricy from the outside. I shouldn't have been so stupid. Its reasonably priced. I've had the burger, pasta and pizza and all are AMAZING!  Friendly wait staff. Never have to wait. And its convent if going to a Suns, Dbacks, or Mercury game. I'll be back that's for sure!"}
{"text":"First time Was not a game night and Service at the bar was on point. Tonight busy slow
To get started and then Calamari came out.....you guessed it cold. They are making a second try so we will see. The chicken parm was awesome the other day but 25 mins in we have not seen it yet tonight. Patience Grasshopper as we sit and stare at the cold calamari still on our table. Huuuuu.  I so wanna love this place. Friendly staff they just might need more help on busy nights like tonight. In the end alls
Well and the food turned out great."}
{"text":"Showed up on a Monday and they were surprising busy with a convention in town and a concert around the corner. 

They weren't expecting the crowd, but the staff hustled and worked hard to keep up.

The complementary bread and pesto was fantastic.  

We ordered tortellini and fettuccine Alfredo - both were fantastic.  The sauces for each were flavorful and the pasta was really nice as well

Excellent value and very good food!"}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, great service! The lobster mac and cheese and Bolognese pasta dishes were to die for. The husband and I are definitely going back to try the seafood  linguine and grilled pork chop. I don't think you could go wrong with any dish you try!"}
{"text":"Amazing food with amazing service. Had the lobster macaroni which was excellent. The staff was extremely helpful and polite!!"}
{"text":"The food is always delicious! It's a hit and miss with the quality customer service. One employee always greets me - others are snobs and are inattentive, cold, and curt."}
{"text":"I'll agree with many that have reviewed here that the service could have been better but, with that said, the food was fantastic and is the reason for the four stars. The Chicken Parm plate was tasty and the Drunken Cheesy Bread appetizer got me buzzed, no joke. I am a bit of a lightweight I suppose... All in all, it was a good atmosphere, good food, with slow drink service, and that didn't bother me much."}
{"text":"Basically the Italian version of Pei Wei.  You order at the counter, you take your receipt and a magnet that sticks to where you're sitting and the food comes out to you.  It's very casual and generally pretty quick which is great for lunch.  The food is okay.  Like I said, its the Pei Wei of Italian.  There is nothing challenging about the menu.  I'm a little frightened of the chicken parm pizza (who needs breading on top of well, bread?) but there is a nice eggplant bruschetta.  I liked their minestrone soup, its wasn't too salty so they get points for that."}
{"text":"I arrived early in the evening  as I was still on EST.  The pasta was very good.  I would encourage patrons to sit outside and enjoy the weather."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the only reason I'm giving this place a 2 star is because the manager ended up comping our meal at the end.

So, let's start with \"the good\". The look of the restaurant is spectacular. It looks Italian, and decor is intriguing (esp. the lights over each table). If Yelp was based on looks alone, the Strand would be a solid 5. Too bad for the Strand that this is not the case...

Now for \"the bad\". The bad outweighs the good like a boulder outweighs a crumb, so let me put this in list form.

1.) The service: We entered this establishment with no prior knowledge of it, no bias. After taking a seat, the four of us ordered our meals shortly after. Another family entered the Strand approximately 10 minutes after us and were seated at the empty table next to us. Their food was served to them 10 minutes before ours made it out to us. One of the folks in our party very specifically ordered their dish without mushrooms. It was brought out with mushrooms. Some time passed before we spotted our server (or A server for that matter) and catching her to let her know of the mistake wasn't an easy feat. Finally, the dish was corrected, though it was brought out after everyone else had:  finished their plates. And although the rest of our dinners were less than desirable, we ate most it because we were all hungry and there were no servers around to bring this up to.

2.) The food: The mushroom thing; okay, that's an honest mistake (though the time it took to correct it was not), but even when they brought out the plate for the 2nd time, the rice was undercooked and crunchy, and it lacked any flavor at all. Everyone at the table tried a bite to confirm this. The pasta another person at our table ordered was overcooked and soggy, while the pizza my wife and I ordered was burned to a crisp. Of course, we would have complained earlier on in our visit if the servers were actually around and didn't dart out of sight as soon as you spotted them. 

3.) The overall experience: Chef Ramsay would have a heyday with this place. Aside from the food that makes one wonder if the chef themselves have ever actually tasted it, and the absent servers, the manager himself didn't seem to understand what constructive criticism is. When he finally came out after requesting him twice, he didn't seem to like what we had to say and tried negating our complaints with the fact that three of the four of us had eaten most of what we'd ordered (after we'd explained the server situation). He asked for constructive criticism, to which we explained that every complaint we had actually was constructive as he could use it to improve upon his business (duh.) He threw his arms up frustrated and said, \"Fine, you're meals comped\" before storming off. I felt bad for a few seconds and then I suddenly didn't anymore. The food sucked, the service was terrible, and because of the terrible service we reluctantly nibbled on the sucky food. I'd have felt violated if we would had to pay for that craptastic experience. 

This place deserves a 1 star review, but because of the manager's decision to do the right thing at the end, I decided to be kinder to their overall rating. I hope that the manager used our constructive criticism to make dining at the Strand more pleasant for future customers."}
{"text":"Extremely quick service (even on gameday's) with no wait to get in despite being right before gametime. Great location next to the downtown stadiums. The food was very filling and tasty - their lobster mac-and-cheese dish was delicious. Would highly recommend for gameday patrons."}
{"text":"Really good Italian with some healthy options. Friendly staff and usually fast experience which makes it a winner for lunch."}
{"text":"Found this place in October,  loved it and came back for our 32nd anniversary dinner.  Lobster Mac & Creamy Alfredo the best!"}
{"text":"I have been here previous times and have had a good experience and a bad experience. Unfortunately this is the worst experience. It is a concert night, so was the last time. We walked in and were seated right away. Awesome! That's when it changed. We waited 25 minutes before we were even greeted. Another 20 minutes before our order was taken. Two parties of two were seated after us and were served and out the door before we even for our food.  My boyfriend was very angry and ready to leave as the poor man had not eaten all day. Finally brought the bread and pesto sauce right before the meals! Worse service I have ever experienced. Didn't come and check on us for drinks, just poorly organized. Do not come here on busy days, you will not be impressed. We will see how the food is tonight. Usually delicious! I really hate when you bring someone who has not been there before and talk it up and it turns out to be crap. The food was good, but not great due to poor service. On previous visit which was a Saturday they served happy hour margaritas. I was told no tonight. It was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and good service.
The food is good but seems they are still working on their recipes. The complimentary bread was cold (a small but important detail) and the \"salsa verde\" was mediocre. I had the Orange and Fennel Prawns and there was too much orange and barely any fennel. My boyfriend had the Lobster Mac n' Cheese. Said the lobster didn't taste fresh and the sauce was too rich.
Ernie, the manager came over and introduced himself. He explained the remodel from the previous concept. 
We'll definitely come back to support a local place at CityScape. I just hope to see some improvements in the food."}
{"text":"Normally would be raving about this restaurant as I do when I get food  delivered from this place.  But not this time! I ordered Angry Shrimp. Aptly named, I was very angry to see that I received only 5 small shrimp (with some baguette on the side).  I called the restaurant to confirm that I received the correct amount of shrimp, and that my delivery person didn't have herself a little snack on ride here (Door Dash is a fantastic food delivery service btw).  They said they give 5 shrimp at lunch and 6 shrimp at dinner.  I was then reminded that this was an appetizer I ordered (That cost me $11.90, plus $4 delivery charge, plus other fees).  To which I responded \"would you be able to share 5 small shrimp?\".  He assured me that there is nothing he could do but I could go back to my delivery service and ask for a refund of my delivery fee.  What I want is more shrimp!!!!!!! I was hoping for a refund of my money, or at least half since I only received about half of what I expected.  I was not offered this or anything to make up for the bad experience.  I love the food here and these shrimp tasted amazingly!  But that love has faded with this disappointing experience."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night for their reverse happy hour and some late night eats. The kitchen closed around 10 or 10:30 and the happy hour pricing started at 9 so there's a decent overlap. We had been here once before and decided to try it again.

The Happy hour pricing is fantastic, $2 Blue moons, I think $3-4 for other on tap beers, and $4 for very STRONG frozen margaritas. I was DD this evening so I did not partake, but the others in our group enjoyed a lot.

I ordered the Chicken Parmesan Pizza and they accidentally brought me the regular Chicken Parmesan entree. They were very apologetic and let me keep the regular Chicken Parmesan while they made the pizza. I had a few bites of what was a very large portion of chicken with penne pasta. It tasted great and the pasta was a perfect al dente. They boxed this up for us when the pizza came (I was in a pizza mood). The pizza was just a cheese pizza with sliced pieces of chicken breast, but still tasty.

Overall the food was tasty and the happy hour prices were excellent. They rectified their mistake and let us keep the food."}
{"text":"I've been coming to The Strand on a regular basis for the last two years. My overall impressions are good, consistent pasta, salads and entrees. The interior of the place is modern, clean and welcoming. The bar is huge and very well organized. Drinks are decent but don't expect any \"craft cocktails\" here. The staff is always friendly and service is quite speedy.

If you're downtown and looking for a solid place to eat, don't pass this by."}
{"text":"The Strand is a great place for lunch. The complimentary bread basket with the pesto olive oil is reason in itself to come. I ordered the caprese sandwich with a side of fries. I couldn't believe the amount of food I got for only $8. The sandwich was great and enough for both lunch & dinner. The fries were dusted with parmesan. 

In/out within about 40 minutes - not bad!"}
{"text":"Terrific food and appetizers. The lasagna is to die for and the pizza was fantastic. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I think I went to a different restaurant than the other reviewers. Maybe we should have gone with the Pasta but I was very unimpressed. We started out with the Green Tea and Marinated Olives. The tea was very good and they had Stevia which is a bonus. The crustini bread that came with the olives was very tasty. We decided to split a Pepperoni and Olive Pizza and a Caramelized Pear Salad for our mains. The Salad would easily have served two as a main or four as a side. The Pears were quite tasty but the ratio of lettuce to toppings was very off. We managed to get a few slices of pear, fig and a few walnuts that had worked their way to the the bottom. The dressing was not quite right but if there were more toppings it would be decent. The pizza on the other hand tasted like the Chef Boyardee Pizza Kits. Honestly that is what it tasted like. The olives were canned black olive slices despite the menu stating kalamata olives. The service was very odd. We had two different servers that apparently did not talk to each other. They did manage to keep our drinks refilled but they brought out the olives then a couple minutes later brought everything else out. We had to move things to another table to make it all fit. She did apologize but it seemed they could have timed it better considering the restaurant was mostly empty. I really wanted to like this place. I think they could make things work with a decent manager and a Chef other than \"Boyardee\" in the kitchen. Hopefully the owner will try some of the great pizzas we have in Phoenix such as Federal Pizza, Cibo, La Grande Orange... and see that there are better pizzas out there that don't come in a box. I debated about giving them a 2 but it was closer to a 3 overall and since Yelp doesn't do half points they get 3 but I recommend skipping the pizza and hoping the pasta and big plates are better. Maybe they will get things right eventually."}
{"text":"Went with a group of people prior to the Fleetwood Mac concert.  We had reservations, which was an excellent thing to do!  Started with the calamari, which came with one sauce and not the two on the menu.  It was typical calamar, nothing to write home for.  Friends had the much recommended Lobster Mac and Cheese and neither finished their plates...kept saying it was very fishy.  I had the chicken piccata, which did not come with nor was I offered soup or salad as the menu says.  Very salty dish and did not finish it.  One other person had the Linguini Pomodoro and she said it was \"ok\".  Apparently the air conditioner wasn't working because it was extremely warm inside and we actually had words with the hostess when she kept closing the big door.  Most likely won't be back...this was one of those try and not again places."}
{"text":"My buddy Craig and I were in the mood for something hearty and saucy so we decided to give The Strand a try and boy were we happy we did. We had the Bucatini Polpetti and a Caesar salad. Although the portion sizes are enough to share, it didn't even cross our minds until after we had stuffed our faces. We had no problem devouring every last bite on our own. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing; robust, spicy, and plentiful. The meatballs were great, too. The salad was definitely enough for two and we will split that in the future. 
The interior design and layout of the dinning area is very different, cool unlike any other place which is refreshing. The ordering process is very similar to Pei Wei but it works and was super easy. The owner was kind enough to stop by our \"pod\" and check in on us and was thrilled to share his design and dinning concept. He excitingly shared the story behind the commissioned panoramic photograph that takes up the majority of the north wall.  The lighting fixtures are also very cool, somewhat jellyfish like.  
We are looking forward to our next dinning adventure. The online menu has been printed, reviewed and circulated."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Tuesday night at 6. Place was pretty empty, so my group (three of us) was seated immediately. Service was quick and attentive. Sliced bread with pesto sauce comes complimentary, and it was really tasty. I had the lobster mac and cheese. It was good but not great, about what I expected. The sauce it came in was pretty spicy. My friends both raved about their meals - a margherita pizza and a pasta special. This place gets bonus points for its location (right across the street from U.S. Airways Center) and for having San Tan Devil's Ale, one of my favorites, on tap."}
{"text":"Wonderful service. Great food. Love the ambiance.  the only reason for only four stars is that the hostess was clearing and wiping tables which was causing a backup at the very small entrance. They were wonderfully accommodating for two without reservations in a busy Saturday night. I would definitely recommend this place any night. Just make reservations to be safe!"}
{"text":"Fantastic cocktails that look like works of art, food good to match.  I had the blackberry lemontini so tasty and looked good enough to paint on a canvas.  Service was a bit slow, but they were slammed so I would give that a pass.  I also had the pizza with chicken and artichokes.  It was very tasty.  I'm eager to come back."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent location and interesting drinks! 

This is a small restaurant within CityScape. My first visit was during the Urban Ale Trail in September, but we just got beer, no food. 

I went with a friend to grab some late night dinner on a Sunday night. I ordered a quinoa vegetable-based dish. It was better than I expected with some interesting spice.  The friend ordered some kind of marinara-based noodles and they were ok, but typical.  The drinks were delicious.  

The server returned often and was friendly."}
{"text":"The service was really good but the food was bland. The calamari had no flavor and was soggy. And the pizza had little flavor and was really soft."}
{"text":"Amazing food, atmosphere and service. The drinks and food are delicious!!! We highly recommend this restaurant. Close to the stadiums downtown. Pizza and hamburger were FABULOUS"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic Italian restaurant in downtown Phoenix.

I have come here alone for a quick lunch, with friends, and with my wife!

it's always a good meal. Service is fast, chicken parmesan is fantastic. Ideal location and decent pricing."}
{"text":"Came here looking for a good carbo load opportunity the night before the rock and roll marathon. This place did not disappoint. The pasta was perfectly tender on my bolognese, and while I am not sure why they call the breadsticks \"drunken\" they were buttery and soft. Price was perhaps more than the food was worth, but the staff were attentive and professional. I was seated at the bar instantly on entering, no wait. 

One improvement could be made with the ladies running around. The cross between entirely professional and almost wearing lingerie felt off putting. But don't let that stop you from enjoying a game at the bar or a night with your friends. Absolutely would come back by myself or with friends/family.

Decor is modern and attractive, white tabletops look amazing and show if they are not clean: I love that kind of accountability!"}
{"text":"Never coming back. Get here at 9:39 and the waitress makes clear that \"we close in 10/15 min...you can order but you gotta make it quick.\" Me as a customer, I know you close at 10 but if I get here at 9:39, you take my order and you lock your doors at 10. First time coming and last time ever!"}
{"text":"This is from an email I sent the restaurant last night:

I am staying in town for business and visited your restaurant for dinner tonight. I know that some servers dislike a party of one for dinner, but Analicia is not one of them. She and another woman enthusiastically greeted me at the host stand, even though it was a slow Monday night (no baseball game in town tonight.) 

Analicia was attentive and friendly, quickly bringing me my drink and then my entree. She saw that I was reading so she checked in with me periodically but was never intrusive. When I asked for a box to take the rest of my lobster mac and cheese - which was delicious - back to my hotel, she took the plate and packaged it up for me. She even gave me an iced tea to go.

Terrific food and fabulous employees will bring me back to your restaurant whenever I'm in town. Please thank Analicia and the rest of your staff for making me feel welcome tonight."}
{"text":"What an awesome place for lunch! Excellent location (right by US Airways Center and not too far from the Ballpark). Brought co-workers out for lunch. Any attire is welcome. Very nice decor and ambiance. The staff is very attentive and nice!

Taking a look at the menu, the food was very reasonably priced! For the way the restaurant looks, you'd think you'd be paying more, but I was incorrect! Food came out pretty quickly and in very nice portions, and plated very nicely! Everything was excellent.

Absolutely coming back whenever I need a nice sit-down meal."}
{"text":"We needed a quick place to eat before watching the Suns game nearby and we stumbled upon The Strand. We were seated right away and the service was quick and efficient! We decided to order the Lobster Mac and Cheese to share since I wasn't that hungry. The portions were not generous but it was enough to satisfy our appetites.

There was so much cheese in our dish and the flavor was good, but not great. The restaurant was packed with high energy and lots of people and I could see it was a great place to mingle. 

For me and my husband, I don't think we would seek out this restaurant specifically just to have dinner since we already have a list of restaurants we would be happy to drive to and dine at. However, if you're in the area and want Italian, check it out!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem...great drinks! Recommend the blackberry Lemontini and the Italo Cescon Pinot Noir. The Quinoa dish and lasagna were very good. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"So...I eat here on a fairly regular basis as it is near my work and thy are usually really good for lunch. The meatball sandwich is awesome! Tonight I came by for dinner after a late night and the lasagne was good...but not as good as the meatball sub."}
{"text":"While with some friends in Phoenix, we stopped at The Strand (Italian) to share an early afternoon snack and a beverage or two. In the heart of Phoenix this restaurant has a casual ... yet modernly eclectic and classy look and feel.

Everyone but me ordered and Italian Margarita. They said it was very good but I liked my Cabernet. We also tried the Fettuccini Alfredo and Penne Pasta with Bolognese Sauce. I preferred the Fettuccini but both were good.

Service was great and prices were reasonable for what you were served. I will return for an evening meal."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Boring, unoriginal, faux Italian food. Seems to me the chef enjoys using that fryalotor instead of grilling or sauteing... which take skill, of course. My companion's side of chicken was not grilled, but deep fried. Which is odd, because the chicken on my caramelized pear salad was obviously boiled.  Another guest's fried zucchini was heavily coated with breadcrumbs, heavy & barely edible. 

It's a great location, good atmosphere, but I will definitely not be returning. Service was mediocre."}
{"text":"Yummy! I am very picky with my Italian food and this one made the cut. It's all in the sauce and they had delicious sauce. We got the cheesy garlic bread, seafood linguini, tortellini, and chicken parm which was humungous! I also got the cheese cake which was good. Waitress was very nice and help; atmosphere was trendy. Overall great experience- we will be going there again."}
{"text":"Great experience!! The food was delicious and the service was perfect. Beautiful patio and nice location. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"We ate here last Friday (6/6/14) with family and friends (6 of us in total). We were sat immediately when we entered. Since we wanted something quick, and \"cheap\" (lol, it's downtown Phoenix, nothing is \"cheap\" there!), this was the place we ended up at.

Inside they have high ceilings, and lamps that drop from them, the lamps were fun to look at and a great way to start a conversation. They have two large TV's on either side of the restaurant so you can watch the game at the bar or while eating. They also have an outdoor patio with misters if you want to eat outside.

The booths are made for large groups. Even small groups are grouped with other spots in the large booths, the only way to have an individual table is if you ate outside, or got a table for two along the wall. The Strand is almost a hole in the wall restaurant, it's thrown under Tilted Kilt, and sitting next to The Arrogant Butcher, so it's rather overlooked by a lot of foot traffic.

Their menu is large, everything from salads to pastas to pizzas and drinks thrown into the mix. Orders were: Chicken Alfredo, Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese, Burger, Salmon Dish, Salad.

I tried some of the Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese, it's spicy but good at the same time, it came to us with the cheese still bubbling and piping hot. The Chicken Alfredo is a simple dish, nothing to write home about, but I wanted something simple that night! I stole some of my mother's Parmesan fries from her plate, they didn't have a Parmesan taste, but they were really crispy and tasted good when dipped in their basil vinaigrette dip they bring to you with some bread while you wait for your meal to cook up.

Our waitress was a doll, she kept our cups filled and made sure we had everything. We chatted with the manager afterwards for a little bit too, if I'm in need for some easy Italian food around the Convention Center again, I'll be stopping by here!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a date spot and found The Strand. The food was good. The bar drinks were not drinkable. Opted for a coke. We were disappointed that the entrees were not served with any sides like a breadstick or salad. Would probably come back if I was in the mood for Italian in a pinch."}
{"text":"The pasta was great! A friend had the sandwich and it was eh. But the worst part was that the tables are bolted to the floor!!! So our party of 7 could all sit together because there wasn't a table large enough to accommodate!"}
{"text":"Today's my coworker's last day and she picked this restaurant for her farewell lunch so I called last Wednesday to book a party of 20 people for today at noon. The girl I spoke to asked for my number and a name for the reservation and ok'd it.

We arrived to The Strand today  at noon and I saw the tables I had specified we wanted were all taken already so right away I realized we had a problem (this is a small restaurant and it's packed during lunch, that's why I called in advance to make sure we got those tables specifically.  We've been there before and we know we won't be able to sit together unless we get those tables.  In fact, every time we go we're a large group and we always get the exact same tables).

These two girls we spoke to today had no idea what I was talking about. I'm talking about a reservation for 20 people! Anyway, it looks like someone dropped the ball big time. I feel bad for the girls we spoke to today because they obviously had no idea and they tried to sit us on different tables but the only reason why I called 48h in advance was to get the 4 tables next to the entrance so we would be sitting somehow together (which I requested specifically).  Sitting on different tables scattered all over the restaurant just makes no sense. 

I didn't get the name of the person I spoke to last Wednesday (it was a girl, that's all I can say) but she took my phone number and said the reservation was fine for today at noon. And I just checked their phone number again to make sure I called the right restaurant because the girls we spoke to today kept asking if I was sure I had called The Strand that's Downtown and yes, that's the restaurant I called.

We like their food and the ambiance of this restaurant but we ended up moving the party to The Corner instead (which was upsetting because that wasn't the place our coworker had picked) and they were extremely accommodating, we all sat together and enjoyed a nice lunch and a nice review's on their way now.

I understand this was an honest mistake and the girls we spoke to aren't the ones to blame for this but they may want to get a better system to reserve tables so they don't have another big group of customers bring their business somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great service, I've been here twice; had the Chicken Parmesan on one occasion and Fetucinne w/ Alfredo Sauce on another."}
{"text":"Was pretty pumped to try a new place downtown, but 'meh' pretty much sums it up. 
Service was fine, but our waitress seemed a little overwhelmed by the number of tables she had.
The location is good (cityscape), and the decor inside is really cute, with these lamps that kinda look like they're made out of spaghetti (a STRAND of spaghetti, I'd say).
Prices are about what you'd expect - $15ish for a pasta plate.
Unfortunately, the food just isn't great. The standout of the evening was actually the drunken bread, which we gobbled up quite quickly. After that, the pasta primavera and chicken alfredo were just bland, and the sausage pizza was actually not good. They're going for the artisan/napoleon style (I think), but instead of being delicious and chewy, the crust was just soggy and limp. The cheese and sausage toppings were no better.
It's an ok place if you have no other option, but in downtown phx, you have many other options. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"3/5 decent, will probably improve.

just had dinner here after work, it was pretty deserted, but i guess that's standard for downtown phoenix. after awkwardly asking if they were open, i realized that it was an order, seat yourself semi-fastfood joint. which is an interesting option to their established \"arrogant\" neighbor. 

overall, i think it's pretty hip, maybe chic, if folks say that out here. the noodle lamp things are an interesting brand, as long as you don't accidentally associate it with strands of e.coli from AP bio, or wormsies. i think if they cut half of those lights out, then it wouldn't be so overwhelming, since the brand/style is quite easy to pick up, don't need to feel like all the tables are so perfectly podlike and replicated. i want to feel special, you know?

the prices are pretty affordable. i mean, yeah, generally food is cheaper out here, but the servings are good to share, as the tables are already set with red plates, white (durable and clothlike quality, i might add) napkins, and silverware!

the food. well it's italian pasta. ultimately (if not evidently) filling, but i resisted the temptation and took it to go (and plan to finish here in my room shortly). tried the pancetta and peas, though the pancetta wasn't browned very much, so it had that salty rawness to it that some folks aren't into. the side caesar came after it, though i'm sure in a couple weeks all the orders will arrive in the traditional order.

finally, gave them a quick tip that they shouldn't keep their plates over the range. if you're a cook familiar with oil-rich cuisines (frying, pasta, etc.), you'll be familiar with how after an amount of time there's just hella oil particles in the air, that settle over the area. it leaves a residue (read: grease), which unfortunately was also all over my nice white plate. was barely noticeable with the dim evening light, but probably visible during the day.

i'll have to see how it does the next time i am in town!"}
{"text":"Great service! Great food. We ordered the veggie primavera and the penne with vodka sauce - both were AMAZING! Left us feeling light, yet still super full and satisfied. Prices were great and our waitress was AWESOME. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Tried this downtown restaurant w/my 2 colleagues for some Italian fare for lunch last week.

The Strand not only has a clever name, but is situated in a great location for folks who work/live downtown, or enjoying a concert/baseball game, etc.

The decor is unique and well-planned, as it's not too bright to create a sort of \"cool mystery\" vibe. The hanging light fixtures are VERY unique and add dramatic flair! 

We didn't dine, but did pick up our lunches at the bar to go. I ordered the grilled salmon with grilled veggies, and my peers had chicken w/pasta.

I anxiously got back to work and was bummed that my salmon was WAY overcooked. I tried to continue eating, but it was near impossible for the dry flaky mass to pass my throat successfully. I picked around the fillet and ate my veggies which were awesome!

I probed my peers for their experience. They both loved their pasta and were left feeling fat-n-sassy!

Despite the dry salmon, I will give them another shot."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to drop in on. Mussels and clams were nice, not impressed with lasagne though.  Got extra sauce on side."}
{"text":"We came here for an early dinner on Sunday and had a great time! The decor is wonderfully chic and our waiter was attentive and helpful. 

I ordered the chicken parmesan and substituted the sauce and pasta type as I was informed it would be no problem. Absolutely delicious and extremely flavorful. The rest of my part ordered, the butternut squash, pizza, and lasagna. No complaints all around. The restaurant was kind enough to put together a little birthday dessert and it ended the night perfectly! 

The service was fast and the overall experience was amazing, I wish I lived closer as it would be a frequent visit for me."}
{"text":"My wife's seafood pasta special of the night was good, but my bolognaise was straight out of a can, and not worth eating.  The service was very good, ambiance was decent, but I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We decided to try something different tonight and headed to the Strand. When we got there it was almost empty but we figured everyone might be out of town for the holiday weekend. 

We ordered the calamari. No flavor. I wanted to order the risotto arancini but they no longer serve it. I also wanted the pancetta and pea pasta but it wasn't on the menu either. Luckily the waiter asked if they could make it and they did. It was ok but not what I'm use to. We also ordered a shrimp and bacon pizza. Not good at all. The signature dish the lobster Mac and Cheese was the only good thing that was ordered.  

Will I go back. No. I do appreciate how nice the waiter was but considering there was only 2 other customers in at this time he could pay us the extra attention."}
{"text":"Based on the previous reviews and pics, thought we would love this place. It's not bad and not amazing either, glorified bar food.  Hostess seemed a bit confused about seating options.  The decor was pretty cool, but having tables right in front of the door with no where for waiting patrons to hangout (the bar was packed) was a bit uncomfortable.  Might try it again."}
{"text":"We ordered chicken  Parmesan for wife and daughter our first night in Phoenix.  The chicken was raw.   Seriously???  Due to poor lighting they ate some of it before realizing the chicken was raw.  I am not taking slightly undercooked I'm saying RAW!  We notified the manager and she was apologetic and gave us comp cards for next time .  Are u kidding?  No way at w going back there.  Wife and daughter got sick the next day.   Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"Used to be a good place until they forgot to put in my takeout order, and had me standing waiting for no reason."}
{"text":"Jessica was our server, the best. The food was good, fresh and it hit the spot. I'm ready to go back for some more. Keep up the good work, Thank you."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is such a hidden gem. It's so good!! We got the Tortellini, Seafood Linguini, and Lobster Mac n Cheese. Let me tell you, it was all delicious. They have happy hour too and the Frozen Margarita hit the spot. If you're in downtown Phoenix, go to CityScape and check out The Strand!! Don't forget to get your parking validated."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch, very little foot traffic in the heart of downtown during lunch rush was surprising so my expectations were low. I had the chicken parm, the pasta was cold and cheese half melted on the warm chicken, kind of gross! Service was awkward, quick but the servers don't seem like they have any training. Plenty of lunch options downtown, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Certainly trendy in appearance by Phoenix standards but I would recommend many places downtown before The Strand.  The service is the worst I have had downtown.  I have dined here more than once for lunch, but will not go back.  The last time I went the server brought an incorrect lunch order to me not once, but twice. (I am talking other guests' meals, not even close to my order.)  I finally ended up with the correct meal after 30 minutes.  Totally unacceptable, especially considering our table was only one of few occupied that afternoon.  

Separately, I called to inquire about catering for a corporate event.  I botched the pronunciation of a word while quickly explaining my potential order to the manager.  He proceeded to laugh at me on of the phone and continue to use the word incorrectly to mock me.  I cannot imagine that their catering business is 'booming' so I'd suggest that their staff be a little more courteous to local patrons who are willing to give it a try."}
{"text":"Interesting ambiance inside and ok sidewalk seating street presence but it was John the outside waiter who makes being there worthwhile. We ordered the mussels and clams in the garlic wine sauce - very well cooked and tasty and paired well with my glass of Chianti. Next the strands and meatballs - light tomato sauce with an interesting flavor, not your Italian Gramma's recipe but it was tasty. Entrees are served with bread and a chilled avocado pesto blend sauce that was tasty as well. Don't bother with the blackberry lemon vodka drink unless you like Koolaid. John did his best to make the drink more palatable by adding limoncello and more vodka but it just made it taste more alcoholic rather than a nice blend of tasty. If this place upped its specialty drinks game and perhaps added veal to the menu it might be a 4 star establishment, but there's something about the place that just doesn't hit the mark. Can't put our fingers on it. I mean, it wasn't bad at all, but it wasn't terrific either. Very sad."}
{"text":"Fig and prosciutto is one of my FAVORITE sweet-vs-savory flavor combos. And the Strand does it justice on their pizza! It was not too overpowering of either topping and the dough was thin crust, but still soft and slightly doughy. The veggie pizza was also yummy, but the fig & prosciutto still wins in my book! 

The restaurant itself has a cozy ambiance that is perfect for a date night or girls night out. Our waitress was extremely friendly, and we had a great time at dinner. Parking was a little hard to find, but I would come back for a nicer night out for good quality pizza!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and menu. The food was mostly all excellent. Our table ordered some pizzas, bruchetta and pasta dishes. The only complaint was the angry shrimp appetizer was not spicy and the portion was a bit small to share in a big group. Would definitely go back though and enjoy the rest of the menu next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"I ordered Chicken Parmesan and salad. The pasta was very cold. Chicken was a weird color when I cut into one of the pieces. However, the breading on it was great and the waitress was wonderful. I did end up getting an allergic reaction to something and broke out all in hives, ended up in the ER."}
{"text":"I ordered the Primavera. So fabulous. Had bread with some oil pesto dip. Overcast November day,  great service. Couldn't have asked for more."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick nosh before heading to the Diamondbacks game with a few friends today.  The girl at the door greeted us right away and got us seated quickly.  She was very friendly and even when one of my friends spilled his water glass she cleaned it up with a smile and didn't make a big deal about it.

The happy hour is great, I'm not 100% sure of what times it goes from but lucky for us it was on when we got there.  During happy hour you get $4 frozen concoctions, $5 specialty martinis, $2 Blue Moons, and half price appetizers.  I feel like there may be even more but that's just what I remember off the top of my head.

I ordered the bruschetta and the Strand Burger.  The bruschetta was great, the bread was perfectly crispy and it was loaded with fresh tomatoes, basil and mozzarella and I think there was some kind of red wine sauce that was drizzled over it too, really tasty!  The burger however wasn't quite my cup of tea.  I can't really even explain why, almost like the flavors just didn't blend well together, but I didn't even finish half of it and a couple of my friends who tried it also felt the same way.  The Parmesan fries that came with it on the other hand were delicious!

I'll definitely come back because of the great service and the prospect of good food, I just won't be ordering the burger again."}
{"text":"The Strand Urban Italian Food Review: 4 stars!  Walked right in on a Saturday night and was seated right away (not a game night).  Nice modern ambiance in the restaurant, good selection of pastas, pizzas, wine, martinis and other drinks in the menu.  Very friendly service as well!  I don't know how Italian this dish is...but the Lobster mac & cheese is a must try!  Very tasty, cheesy and filling!  Chicken Alla Vodka was good too and they gave us a good portion of chicken.  Complementary bread was ok, but their pesto/vinegar dip was so good!  It's also perfectly fine to share a glass of wine...they serve it like Postinos."}
{"text":"An okay place.  I had the 

Calamari -- they were soggy and chewy, not crispy. Disappointing start.  It looked like it could have been good if it were crispy.

Pear fig salad with goat cheese -- best part of the meal. The combination of dressing, figs, toasted nuts, and pears were nice. 

Chicken vodka sauce -- good but not noteworthy.  The dry, overcooked chicken was masked by the generous portion of tasty sauce and zucchini."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with the commitment to local az brews. Even a couple of Flagstaff options. The waiter brought samples  that weren't even on the menu. Loved the Prescott Achocolypse. Shrimp Alfredo was delish!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and the Italian dip was heaven to my taste buds. Ordered the Italian dip absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I have dreams of the fettuccine Alfredo I had there. It's conveniently  located in Cityscape and close to lightrail. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Oh yeah... The Strand is a keeper. I expected it to be good, but after I was done with the veggie pizza my eyes rolled to the back of my head and I felt like I needed a cigarette. It was that orgasmic. 

All the restaurants along 1st Street are phenomenal, and the Strand fits in nicely. Fantastic, high quality food at very reasonable prices, friendly service in a unique, urban atmosphere. And praise be to whatever deity you believe in that this place is 1) open past 5 pm AND 2) open on Sundays. 

I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Italian Roast Beef: actually a sandwich. That wasn't clear on the menu, but not a big deal, because it was good. Made better by the aioli dip and fries.
Lobster Mac n Cheese: really tasty.
Rum-drenched cake with ice cream: perfect ending.
And one of the nicest parts of the whole evening was the girl who waited on us, Kristen (sp?) who was back-and-forth at tables and the bar.
We're happy customers.
Maybe double-check your Apple map directions when trying to find the place."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place and wasn't impressed. It first started when we sat down and the hostess gave us the utensils. The utensils had hair on the napkin of which we picked off and kept browsing our menus because it wasn't a big issue to us. We ordered our drinks and food and carried on. I ordered their Tuscan Tea which is supposedly like a Long Island Iced Tea. It wasn't very good because it seemed watered down. We had Calamari as an appetizer and it was very rubbery and didn't seem authentic at all but was okay in taste. Once we received our food is why I'm writing this review. I ordered the Bistecca (which is steak)medium and it tasted like they boiled the steak and didn't bother to season it! It did  look like a good medium steak though. My boyfriends food though?!.........He ordered the Lasagna and as he started chewing on his first bite he realized that he couldn't break down a particular part. He thought it was cheese but it was actually HAIR! He sent it back and they remade it. They offered us a free dessert but their dessert menu is limited and it wasn't something that we wanted. Once we declined the offer they didn't offer to discount ANYTHING which is disturbing to me! My boyfriend and I have decided that we'd never return here because the food was just okay and the fact that the customer service, after finding hair in his food, didn't result in some kind of compensation is a negative experience."}
{"text":"Really great food and atmosphere! We were planning on going to Arrogant Butcher but the wait was too long. We went to The Strand since it was next door and didn't look as busy. The food was great as well as the service. We were going to the ballet and our server made sure we  got everything quickly. Will certainly be back next time we go to a show downtown. Much better value than Arrogant Butcher."}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner (pre-comedy show) on my birthday. Garlic bread-YUM,  Pomodoro-yum, Prosecco-yum, Lemoncello-yum.  Casual class, nice atmosphere and decor. Very affordable for the high quality. 5 stars for a larger wine list, but still worth a visit!"}
{"text":"This place was excellent. We went there and the place was packed and we had 10 people so we weren't sure we were going to get in. They told us 1.5 hours so we put our name down and had a drunk next door. Within 30 min they got us a table. The food came quick, the lobster mac and cheese is amazing all the good tasted fresh. The service was also great. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"We walked in after a Suns game and it was 9:30 P.M., which was almost closing time. The service was great, our waitress didn't make us feel rushed at all. I ordered the caprese as an appetizer, which was so tasty, it must have been the balsamic vinaigrette they used. For my entree I chose the lasagne and it was perfect! I've had lasagne in Rome and in Florence and this was very similar in taste. I'd love to go back and try more of their menu."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic,  service was excellent,  price was a good value.  Easy to spend money at Cityscape and get a lot less for your money than Strand."}
{"text":"Went here with some girlfriends before a show at Talking Stick arena & was not impressed. My meal for one was cold. The bread was semi-stale and when I mentioned it to the waitress she replied that they get 'it shipped in fresh every day.' A more appropriate customer oriented response would have been I'm so sorry about that I'll let our manager know. Furthermore my girlfriend ordered a salad with dressing on the side, salad came out 5 minutes after our meals and had dressing on it. When we asked to get it sent back it took 20 minutes. I would not come back here again."}
{"text":"For a restaurant in such a lively area with such exuberant decor, it's a shame that the service was mediocre at best. The hostess was warm and inviting, but our server disappeared. I ate my entire meal with an empty cup of water because she wasn't around to offer a refill. The prices are decent."}
{"text":"I am being generous with the 'one star' review after our encounter tonight at The Strand. Two days ago, I had called in and talked with the hostess. I made a reservation, giving my first and last name, phone number, time of reservation (9:00pm) told them it was a special occasion for a birthday on New Years, and a count of how many people were in our party. The hostess confirmed everything and it was set. (By the way, I specially asked if they were taking reservations for New Years and the host said yes we are). Yesterday, I called in to add two guests to the reservation. Confirmed. Two phone calls to the restaurant as of now. So after the Suns Game on New Years our party walked over to The Strand. We arrived about 8:55. The hostess, who we could already tell was over it by her attitude greeted us and told us they are closed. Of course, we looked at her dumbfounded. I said we have reservations that were made two days ago. The response we got, 'Yeah, you are right here on our reservation list but we close at nine'. Ok? So, first off. I am assuming this hostess that took the reservation, clearly, was not trained correctly in telling time or taking reservations. Once she told us she was not seating us, we asked to speak to a manager. She walked away and was never seen again; as we did her job for her for every other party that walked in that she didn't bother to talk to or relay the message to that they were currently closed. About five minutes after we had asked a manager walks over and we tell her the situation. She looks on the reservation and what do you know, there is our reservation. She said, well we were going to call you but didn't have a contact number. I said the hostess just told me that all of our information was right there on the reservation slip. So, where's the truth in this? The manager on duty says ok, give me a few minutes to clear a table and we'll take you for dinner. TWENTY minutes go by as we literally sit in the front of the restaurant and just watch the entire staff walk back and forth without saying a word to any of us. The 'manager', no where to be found. Finally, a 'server' comes up and says are you guys still waiting on a table? We answered, Yes and explained that the manager said that she would seat us and take us since there was a misunderstanding on their end. His response back, 'yeah that's not going to happen we are 'literally' completely out of food'. Ok? SO WE SAT AROUND AND WAITED TWENTY MINUTES, FOR WHAT? For you to act so rudely and not even be courteous enough to come talk to guests? For the manager to walk away and completely ignore us? And let me just mind you, I manage at a restaurant. I know how these types of situations go. Any DECENT restaurant could and would accommodate to an ERROR that they had made. I have had many evenings where I opened my kitchen back up to please and accommodate to my guests, as it is the professional way of doing so. To tell your party, you are completely out of food? Please, hold your breath. Be truthful and just tell us that you simply don't want to open your kitchen or make right on your mistake. NO restaurant is completely 'out of food'. I am sorry, that's the poorest excuse I've heard yet! And if you were really completely out of food, you better hire in someone who actually knows how to handle your ordering and how to inventory correctly for holidays, weekends, etc. Long story short, he just continued to sit with us and argue the fact of being out of food and not answer why no one has the courtesy to come up and talk to us the last twenty minutes we sat in the restaurant waiting. We have visited here a few times and for the record, we will be finding a new restaurant to take our business to when we visit downtown. We were treated absolutely horrible and the customer service lacked on every aspect. We took our business to Arrogant Butcher, where we were treated properly and had a good rest of our evening. Big let down on this restaurants part. The owner may want to try and get his management and staff team on the same page, and maybe try to get management FOH that knows how to handle customer service situations and address issues, not run to the bar and stand behind it to avoid contact with us. You ruined a great spot we enjoyed as I am sure you will ruin for many others with the show you are running. Happy 2018 Strand! You came in with a bang!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken Marsala. Chicken was pretty tough though still juicy. Mashed potatoes were way too dry. A bit disappointed to be honest."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE.  One of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had.  The setup is a little like \"Pei Wei\" where they take your order, give you a number, and bring the food to your table.  Placed our order, and had to stalk other tables and hover over people eating trying to wait to get a table.  Waited a long time, all the while others who ordered after us found seats and got their food before us. Servers kept bringing my food to me since it was ready, but I still didn't have a table, so they kept saying they would \"put it under the heat lamp\" for me.  Finally eventually found a table, and then kept waiting and waiting for our food, which the manager claimed \"he had them remake\" since it was getting cold.  My food came, and it was cold and disgusting.  We had to get going since we were going to a show, and my mom's food still wasn't there.  The staff asked to see her receipt, since they couldn't find her order.  She went up to the manager and said she just wanted her money back since we had to go (it had been 45 minutes since we placed our order).  He said her food would not be ready for a while, and gave her some cash, and we left.  My mom never even ate, and my food was horrible.  I would NOT recommend this place, it's awful."}
{"text":"This place is in my top 2 favorite places I tried in Phoenix. The arrogant butcher being the other. The food and service were great. To top it off, it was ladies night, so we got appetizers for half off! Perfect!

The stand outs were: the lobster mac & cheese, Linguini Pomodoro with shrimp, Drunken Cheesy Bread, Parmesan Fries, and the salmon. It was all so good!"}
{"text":"Great customer services....
The food taste good. I ordered chicken ala vodka.. I recommend this place"}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix for a convention and we had our company dinner here. This place had a great atmosphere and I absolutely loved the light chandeliers they had, very cool. The food I had was here AWESOME! 

My coworker and I split the fried zucchini and it was good, nothing special about it but it was still good, but my dinner however was what made this place great. I was debating between the pork chop and the crab linguine, but when the waitress came over I asked her what she would pick between the two. Now I know its sometimes not great to ask the waiter/waitress about what's good because they may like something that you may not like but this waitress recommended I try a special that they usually do not have. I'm the type of person who will usually take a chance and was I glad I did. She recommend that I try the seafood risotto which had shrimp, clams, scallops, and a lobster tail on top of a creamy and cheesy risotto. 

Best risotto I have ever had and if this place was in my hometown I would go there very time I had the chance too just so I could have this entree. The other plates my coworkers had were also very delicious. 

The reason I gave this place a 4 out of 5 stars was because the service was not that great. We had a large party at our table and our waitress went around the table taking our orders however she forgot to come back to someone and take their order. She also took one side of the table, put that order in and then took the other side. Due to that mistake our table did not get all of their food at the same time, plus that person who she forgot got their food much later, granted it was also kind of their fault for not remembering to order but still...

with all of that said I would still recommend trying this place out when your in phoenix, just make sure they have the risotto :)"}
{"text":"Contemporary atmosphere.  Good range of Italian offerings.  Attentive wait staff.  Portions generous.  Price reasonable.  Food fine.  
I'd go again."}
{"text":"After finding this on the Yelp \"just reviewed\" section, I decided to give The Strand a try. We went on a Thursday night, and met some friends, who have 2 small children.
It was fairly empty, and far more casual than I had imagined. That's not a bad thing by the way.
Cute decor!!! I had the chicken parm with penne pasta which was good..my husband had the chicken parm pizza, which he also enjoyed.
Our friend sent back the chicken for her dish..she felt it was slightly pink...and they fixed the issue asap.
Nice service and dessert was pretty good too. We had the cookie with ice cream combo. I'm sure on game nights this spot will be jumping.
OH, and they validate parking for the garage..very handy."}
{"text":"Here's the thing about this place, stick to what the reviewers say. Quinoa Plate, Lobster Mac n Cheese, Roast Beef Italiano and Meatball sub were all amazing.

The Crab Linguini was very fishy. 

Overall my table was happy. Those that stuck to what I read in reviews as excellent, was excellent.

I may come back for lunch sometime, it's not mind blowing but it was good."}
{"text":"Visited my friend at work and we decided to try this place out. There was a company Xmas party so it was kind of loud, but we didn't mind. The Risotto Arancini was hot crispy and delicious. For main course I suggest you order the Pancetta and Peas, there's all kinds of good shit in there."}
{"text":"http://foodtube.net/video/italian-the-strand-phoenix-az

Best Italian restaurant in Phoenix! Great food and the Best Staff!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, pretty big portions. Their service was great!!!! I believe our waitress was named Ashely... She was amazing. Super friendly never had to flag her down for anything. She definitely made our experience that much better."}
{"text":"LOVED that artichoke flatbread pizza!  Great service, good outdoor people watching seating. Reasonably priced.  Definitely would go back for pizza when in town.  Good food!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 different times and every time the food is awesome! I was driven to right a review after my last visit. I was at The Strand the night before the Super Bowl and everywhere was a mad house! It was a nightmare downtown. However, when we got here the hostess said it could possibly be an hour wait at least and we had a table of 13 people. To my surprise, we were sat after about a half hour! Our server Sarah came up and took our drink orders almost immediately and offered to split all of our checks for us. We have our food order right away since we were all starving and had been salivating over the menu before sitting down. Our appetizers (calamari) came out in less then 10 mins. And our meals showed up (I got the beef tortellini, my favorite) about 10 mins after that. I was beyond impressed that it all came out perfect and in a timely fashion considering the ridiculous hordes of people that were in the restaurant! All our orders were right and all of our drinks stayed filled the entire time! Sarah had a great personality and had a smile the whole time, regardless of the fact she was running around like crazy and she was efficient and got our bills out right when we asked! I will continue to come back and thank you for the great service!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I walked into this restaurant to try something new.  We sat outside.  The service was extremely slow.  Our server looked like she was not all there- she could hardly speak in complete sentences and her eyes where rolling around.  We ordered and when our lunch came out - I was totally disgusted by the smell of my plate. I picked at my food and the Quinoa vegetable smelled like sour milk or rotten something. My boyfriend had the roast beef sandwich and the meat was spoiled- he had an upset stomach and soon after he was vomiting.
The manager asked us to never show our faces again at the restaurant.
Trust US....we won't.  The health department needs to pay a visit to his place."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect, the prices were better than I expected. For the firs time being there I was impressed.  good price and good food."}
{"text":"This place used to be the BOMB, but they changed their format from a \"lunch/dinner\" style place for us downtown workers, so a sit-down only place and changed the menu.....HUGE mistake, before they had an excellent chicken marsala which is was taken off the menu. Last week I had the chicken alfredo and it was HORRIBLE, the chicken tasted pre-cooked which was never an issue before, I'm sure the bowl it was served in was to compensate for serving size which was noticeably smaller than before. 

I won't be back, I was soo disappointed"}
{"text":"The waitress was fairly nice. She never came over to our table and asked how things were. My husband got a refill finally after he was done with his meal. AS I was looking around the tables I seen that they were getting bread. Our bread came literally 10 mins before our meal. They were not busy but got the worst service. I expected top notch cause we PAID top Notch. My food was disgusting, my cheese was not melted and my plate was cold! My daughter had the chicken fingers which she didn't really eat cause the chicken had NO flavor what so ever and our waitress never came by to ask if she needed any condiments. At then end of the meal never asked how anything was no manager or nobody came to our table to see how everything was. Would never go back."}
{"text":"It didn't meet my expectations! The food was ok, and t the braised short ribs were on the big plates part of the menu, it should have said it'a regular portion served on a huge plate. I am not disappointed so I'll give it anocher chance."}
{"text":"I went here Tues night before the Adele concert. I had the crab linguine for my dinner. What little crab it had looked really unpleasant. It looked like some kind of shredded cat food out of a can. It did not taste much better. When I ate bites that did not contain crab, the dish tasted like weak, watered down tomato sauce. I ate maybe a 3rd of it, before I couldn't stand it anymore. My sister had the basic spaghetti and meatballs. She said it was ok, but nothing to write home about. Since we had more time to kill after dinner, we ordered a bread pudding for dessert. The smell was incredible. But, the bread itself was SUPER dense, so much so that I could barely use my spoon to cut through it. But the flavor was decent, but again, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Ordered butternut squash ravioli 
It was great but oily 
The entree quickly came out and it was super busy which is always a red flag to me 
Chicken Parmesan came out cold
Waitress was awesome sent it back
Next one came out just as fast 
They basically shoved it in the oven so it came out hot but the breading was super soggy.  Basically sliding off the chicken in a pasty clump.
I wouldn't eat here again 
Service was amazing which is why I gave it two stars 
Food not so much"}
{"text":"I got the Pomodoro and Crab Linguini tonight for carry out, and both of the pasta dishes were just \"eh\" with what they are both priced at. I will not be coming back here for their pasta, but may try something else in the future"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's solid Americanized Italian food. Seating is always fast and friendly, service was just okay. The ambiance is funky and modern yet comfy. The outside patio area is my favorite place to sit, great people watching! The portions are giant. It's a great place to go before/after a Suns game or any other event night downtown. 
FOOD: The chicken sandwich has good flavor, but is a little sloppy. The French Dip was great, I would order it again. The Parmesan Fries are yummy. The donuts were PERFECT for dessert!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had planned on tripping over to Hanny's before a Suns game on a Sunday night, which was quickly halted by the fact that Hanny's wasn't open.  We decided to give The Strand a try because my boyfriend is an avid Italian food fan and we love to try new places. 

We arrived during happy hour, which is DAILY, and we were thrilled to find that the discounts are AMAZING.  We ordered two beers ($2 Blue Moon drafts), an appetizer ($2.50 Drunken Cheesy Bread), and two entrees (Pepperoni Pizza and The Strand Burger, both $5 on happy hour).  We had a fantastic server, Cody, who brought us out an order of Angry Prawns as he said the food was taking a while (we didn't think so, but we were happy to try out another appetizer!).  

The pizza was enough for two, so for the price, it was great.  While the pizza wasn't the best pizza in the world, it was good and, like I said, for the price, you can't beat that.  For a thin crust pizza, we felt the crust was a little on the dough-y side and there was a bit too much cheese. The Strand Burger was delicious, but filling.  I could only eat half after two appetizers and a beer.  

For two beers, two appetizers and two entrees...our bill was just under $20. UNREAL. We walked out stuffed, happy, and satisfied with the service.  We'll definitely be going back! 

**I'm giving this restaurant four stars for two reasons.  1) The pizza quality.  For an Italian restaurant, we would have loved to see this come out better. And 2) The seating.  At the beginning of our meal, we practically had an entire row to ourselves, but by the end, we were crowded by a couple to the left and a pair of buddies to our right in very close proximity.  You feel like you're involved in their conversation because you can hear everything they're saying."}
{"text":"Not the best Italian food I've ever had, but it was decent for the price. The staff was friendly and attentive (I sat at the bar so it was kind of hard to ignore me lol). And I was able to get a seat immediately at 6:30 on a night a conference was at the convention center. 

I had the Caprese appetizer that was very good. I also had the Chicken Parmesan entree and found it to have good flavor, but both the chicken and the pasta side lacked in the sauce department. The Chicken Parmesan was basically cheesy chicken, but I got asked for extra sauce and with that it was very good. I'd be willing to eat here again."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed was that the decor was very cute. The light fixtures had a noodle looking fabric hanging down. I also liked that they were able to accommodate large parties. 

Okay let's talk food! I ordered pasta that the server described as a sauce that was a mixture between Alfredo and spaghetti sauce.  I felt the dish needed more sauce.  I also thought it would have more veggies based on how it was described. I must say what it lacked in flavor they made up in portions. However, if you don't love it doesn't matter how big the portion."}
{"text":"I came here as part of the Downtown Phoenix Wine Walk. We got free brushetta and tried some qines and sangrias.

Brushetta was aoo good... the tomatoes were seas9ned to perfection. And their house wine was a great pairing. I was not dissappoonted at all. And will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Try it - cheap and good food! The bruchetta is very good.."}
{"text":"Great pesto with bread appetizer. Awesome sauce on the mussels and clam appetizer.  I had crab linguini and the small slices of asparagus with a slightly spicy sauce was the way to go. The Mac and cheese with crab and bacon was good too.  The tiramisu was excellent. I saw a review that said this place was no different than Olive Garden but I disagree. Service could have been a little quicker but she was delightful and helpful."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!!  Upon arrival we were told it would be a 10 minute wait for a table.  No problem.  We asked if we could wait at the bar, they said no problem.  We sat at the bar, ordered a drink.   We finished the drink, still no table.  After 20 minutes we checked back with the hostess, she said \"oh we can seat you now.\"   We were shown to a table outside.  We waited for a server.  The table next to us was given Service.  We waited.   The table on the other side was given Service.  We waited.  We waited some more.  We finally gave up and went to the bar to pay for the drinks so we can go.  Guess what happened?  We waited another 10 minutes before we could pay and leave.  The service is terrible.  The management should be ashamed."}
{"text":"The patio area was the perfect place to enjoy dinner with a few friends.  After a few drinks upstairs, my group decided to stop here for a quick dinner before driving home.

It was perfect for our group, since it soon became about 15 people from the event upstairs.  I must say service was on the slow side, but with only one server, late night hours, and on a weekday, I give them credit.  Most likely they don't get crowds of 15 people late at night on a weekday.  

Well I know it was worth the wait.  We enjoyed the lobster mac and cheese, calamari, and I had the opportunity to consume The Strand burger.  The Strand burger is a half pound of meat, Gorgonzola cheese or switch to Cheddar if need be, red onion, lettuce, and a tomato.  The Parmesan cheese fries were perfect to pass around.  Plenty of fries to share and the burger is such a large portion most will have to take some home.  I would say a great bargain for $10.  

The lobster mac and cheese was a hit at our table.  Plenty of people tried it and even some who normally do not consume seafood said it was delicious.  I cannot comment on it, since I have a food allergy to it.  However based on my groups comments and general \"it's good\" after taking a first bite I must encourage you to try it.  Yes good food does cost a bit more, but $15 for lobster infused mac and cheese seems reasonable.  

The restaurant is located right in cityscape, which is the heart of downtown Phoenix.  It has great decor and a great location.  I suggest the patio if the weather is right.  Views of the city, people, and environment makes for great entertainment while you dine."}
{"text":"This place was accommodating to our large party (We came in about 15 deep after a yelp event nearby... needless to say we were boisterous and thirsty!) with a section on their sidewalk patio.  It was late and they were not very busy.  The staffing was light at that time and the waitress had a hard time properly serving us along with her other tables though.  We still had fun and the food and drinks were tasty!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, great food, affordable prices. Accommodated our group of 18 with ease. Would definitely go back if I'm ever back in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my birthday and I was looking forward to trying The Strand. My girlfriend heard from many of her friends that this place has the best Italian food around. We arrived at 8:42 pm in which the hostess told us they were closing in 15 minutes. I was ok with that and told her to seat us still in which they don't close till 9. The hostess then proceed to tell us they were on a limited menu until they close. I asked her why in which we are paying customers. My girlfriend and I decided we didn't feel welcomed at The Strand so we left.

This is when the manager or hostess went crazy. When we were outside talking about how rude she was, she came out and started being very defensive. We explained to her if the sign says 9 then stay open till 9 serving guests. She kept making excuses that the staff wanted to go home. I told her to close at 8:30 then. She then said \"Come on in then, you get what you wanted.\" She was screaming this in a very defensive manner in which we felt threatened.

My girlfriend and I both work in the customer service industry. I have stayed open later just to make that customer happy. That's part of the job. For the lady that treated us with so much disrespect, she shouldn't work anywhere around people with those customer service skills."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Once for half price bottles of wine and pizza for happy hour. And today got the Lobster Mac n cheese that I saw on the menu last time. Too much for one sitting. I guess I'll have awesome leftovers tomorrow....oh darn."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was tasty but nothing special. My fiance ordered the Chicken Parm and I ordered the Steak & Kale salad. Solid amount of food for the price..we both walked away feeling satisfied and full. The basil and garlic dipping sauce that came with the bread was astounding - I would venture to say the highlight of the meal.

Great overall location if you're headed over to catch a Suns or Diamondbacks game.

It was hard to get a taste for overall ambience as we sat outside. Would come back if in the area but not in a rush to - wasnt 'blown away but it's a decent little italian spot."}
{"text":"Keep walking. This place had some of the worst service I've ever had. 

Reservation for 6 at 6:45. Walk in at 6:40 with no hostess in sight. No servers/managers came up to us. 6:47 rolls around and hostess slowly makes her way up to hostess stand, I tell her we are here for our 6:45 reservation, she rolls her eyes and tells us we are late!!!! we sit down, get our drinks, order food.   2 meals came out way before the others, we did not get the appetizer we ordered, no apology. Meals were ok , nothing great. Server never came by to fill our water, and took a looooong time to help us with any requests. I would not make an effort to eat there."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for during a \"Taste tours\" tour of downtown PHX.  The bruchetta was fine but the bread could have been toasted, it was too soft and the mix soaked in too much.  The pasta was fine, but not spectacular.

We ordered the \"italian margarita\" but I'm not sure why it was considered \"italian\".  It tasted like a regular margarita but extremely frozen.  We had the worst brain freezes of our life.  My whole group of friends, all five of us, found it painful to finish our drinks.

The atmosphere was pretty, not a bad place to grab a quick drink, but I wouldn't make the trek out to phoenix for this restaurant."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner before a Suns Game. We were sat in an awkward corner of the restaurant where we felt we were forgotten about. The food was slightly bland, except the Parmesan zucchini appetizer, which was good. Service was mediocre at best. Took a bit to get our water and drinks. We weren't offered the complimentary bread. It took 15 minutes for our server to print our check, pick up our credit card and return our receipt. Most likely will not return."}
{"text":"Great concept...notwithstanding the quirkiness in delivery.

Food was outstanding...but I have a hard time forgetting that it took nearly one hour to have one dish of pasta delivered to our table. I understand that they were busy and I respect that....However my dish was brought to the table barely warm and I had to send it back to get reheated twice.

Yes I like my food hot...While we were not in a rush as we arrived plenty of time early for the Cirque du Soleil show...One server was outstanding while the others seemed completely indifferent and in over their heads.

Caesar salad was great...but then again that's one in my book that's hard to mess up.

Pasta with meat sauce was very tasty even though it was sent back to the kitchen twice.

The lines can be quite long. I do truly believe that The Strand has formidable potential and is a fantastic concept. The only problems I see is the lack of staff, and cooking Italian in a snap is a difficult task as the menu is quite diverse....Add to that long lines of customers out the door and a recipe for chaos can quickly simmer up..."}
{"text":"The Strand is located in CityScape and entered into an agreement with its residents offering a discount if they dine there.  As residents, we believed they would honor this agreement but after numerous visits where its managers rejected the discount existed or worse, claimed the discount was discontinued, we've concluded both its management and its ownership has deliberately lied to us. Thus, this is a dishonest establishment unworthy of any positive reviews based on meritorious service or professionalism."}
{"text":"I rarely post a review, good or bad and the food is the only reason I'm posting one now.  This place looks great inside, but there's a reason The Arrogant Butcher next-door was packed and this place was mostly empty.  We were in a hurry so had to choose this place. We ordered a simple salad w/ chicken and a sausage and mushroom pizza, they also brought us bread w/ pesto.  The pizza was ok, thanks to cheese and sausage, but bland sauce and crust. The chicken in the salad reminded me of McDonald's, the tomatoes looked old and warm.  The pesto was ok also, just too lemon-y for me.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"The lobster Mac & cheese is one of the best I have ever had including from The Capital Grille which says a lot about this little place. Desert was to die for and I couldn't have spent my bday at a more delicious place can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Nice menu, decent service, and ambience semi-intimate.  the Bolognaise was good. The garlic bread app was tasty but wish they'd give you a choice of no cheese. The Gouda vegetable ravioli was a good portion and tasted wonderful -  but not hot and sent it back to the kitchen for reheating. Did get house bread but pesto came from the fridge as it was ice cold. No dessert as the place is a little pricey but expected for downtown. Just wish these so called \"trendy\" places had quality of food instead of relying on alcohol sales. We received a 10% military discount which was appreciated. Overall, it was ok but I wouldn't run back."}
{"text":"I heard some good stuff about this place. When you first walk in, it was good ambience. Food was average. My boboyfriend ordered chicken alla vodka and I ordered the Margarita pizza. However, service was horrible. The waitress would walk off as you are talking to her. The first was when I got up to ask for ranch dressing I walked up to her. As I was talking she walked away. The second time was when I asked for a box. But overall,  good food."}
{"text":"The food is good the environment is hip but my waitress was HORRIBLE! She stuck a unwrapped straw in my drink and it splashed on me.. no apology and reached over me 5times had a stank face and honestly sucked"}
{"text":"The strand was good, just not great. We ordered a chicken bacon pizza, chicken Parmesan, and beef tortellini. My son said the pizza was great, but then again I don't think I've ever heard a kid say any pizza was bad. The chicken Parmesan was overlooked and dry. The tortellini was amazing. Pasta cooked Al dente and the sauce was delicious. We also tried the calamari and it was good too."}
{"text":"Horrible experience!!!
-waited 15 mins for a waitress
-Sangria taste like water
-Alfredo taste like hamburger helper
On top of that the manager wanted to do nothing to make our first experience better!
We will never back!!!!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 5:00 PM without a reservation and had immediate seating. By 5:30 the restaurant was packed. Great food and great service. The Pinot Noir was fabulous. We had the wedge salad, the pasta bollinese, and the salmon.  All were great.  Cost was $134 for three of us including $49 for wine and desert. Find it under the Twisted Kilt in Phoenix Cityscape."}
{"text":"On New Year's Day my niece and I came after our ice skating date.
I've passed by this place a few times and we where happy they where open on this holiday.
My niece had their cheese pizza and I had their meatball strand! She gave this place a good two thumbs up.
On my end, I liked the meatballs very much. Unfortunately, the spaghetti was over cooked and the bread and pesto they bring out was cold and the pesto a little runny.
All in all, not bad and we left with our bellys full!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable. I come downtown to enjoy a concert and beforehand, end up in this place. I sit down expecting the least. All I wanted was a good night with my daughter, then I ordered the lasagna. A good night just got GREAT!  Blown away at how delicious it was. My daughter, picky eater, loved the alfredo thing. The staff is super friendly. And then Hank tried to walk in, they stopped him at the door.  He stood on the sidewalk yelling and we all ignored him. I will be back. I recommend The Strand. I still do not recommend Hank."}
{"text":"This place is on point. Food is fresh, healthy, and fantastic. Usually Italian leaves you feeling lethargic and full. Not here. I love it. Pear salad and the \"Spring Bounty\" Primavera are my top two recommendations."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this place isn't BAD.....it's just not awesome. I went here on Friday night with the BF for a date and to use a Doozy Deal coup. We made reservations on opentable, which got us the table, but oddly, instead of confirming that we went to the restaurant, they cancelled our reservation. This was kind of annoying because we didn't get our points, but it could have been an honest mistake. We tried a variety of food including: arancini, drunken cheesy bread, strands w meatballs, and minestrone soup. We also got drinks- I got the Italian margarita and the BF got some white wine. His wine came out with cork or dust in it at first, but they replaced it when he told them. The marg was good, like an alcoholic slushee. The food was all pretty good...the minestrone had lots of veggies, but was on the salty side. The bread was a bit odd...did taste like wine, but I probably wouldn't order it again. The arancini were really good! They had some pancetta in it and came with a really tasty lemony sauce and a marinara. I only wish there were more of them! The 'strands' were good and the meatballs were juicy. The service was friendly but slow. Also, they brought all of our food out at the same time, which I didn't love because it made everything get cold before we got a chance to eat it...don't know why they wouldn't bring soup, then apps, then mains.....Overall, it was good...it just wasn't great....and I thought it was a bit overpriced. I would consider going back and giving them another try, especially for a happy hour or something."}
{"text":"I almost feel bad giving this a 2-star review because the food was pretty good. The reason I give it 2 stars is because we had terrible service. Our server was extremely slow, had no idea about what beer and wine they served, and didn't even know which of the wines that were ordered were red or white. She kept asking us \"what color is that one?\" Which I found pretty ridiculous.

The food was good though. I would suggest the pizzas as a group of us split a bunch of the different pizzas and every one of them was really good. I would say give it a try and hopefully you'll have better service than we did."}
{"text":"First time, had an excellent meal with excellent service! Friends had the chicken marsala and rosemary salmon, we had chicken piccata and Bolognese. For appetizers we had calamari and bruschetta, and great desserts. The staff was on top of it in spite of a really busy night and full house."}
{"text":"Last Weekend we had a group of 12 people for dinner for my Birthday. It was SO good!! Appetizers, dinners and drinks were great! Our whole party couldn't stop taking about the food and how they wanted to go back. Service was good as well and the restaurant is a nice modern sheik decor that was a nice ambience.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for NYE dinner and I was relieved there wasn't a prixe fix menu like every other restaurant in downtown Phoenix. This was my first time here and I was pretty impressed with the size and decor. For some reason I was expecting something more casual but it was very nicely decorated and upscale. 

Our server was very attentive and friendly even with the place being packed. I ordered a martini and a margherita pizza. My drink was good but I was very disappointed in the pizza. The crust and dough were very limp and cheese too thick. When I took a bite, almost all of the cheese on the slice tried to come with it because it was so thick. I had some of my husband's pizza which was only slightly better. The dough was just too limp and not what I would expect from this place. Maybe Little Caesers. 

I want to go back though and give it another shot...."}
{"text":"First time and left without trying anything because the service was that bad. My bf and I came in and sat at the bar close to 8 PM, given menus and water and that was that for the next 30 min. We were literally sitting at the entrance where the waiters/waitresses pass to enter the bar and NOTHING. We finally just got up and one of waitresses started approaching us and I told her not to bother because this was the worst service. The place wasn't even that busy, a few tables and the bar were empty,  the patio was dead."}
{"text":"I've only been here for lunch but both times were great! Jeremiah is awesome. Attentive, funny, patient and makes terrific recommendations! My first time I had the marguerite pizza and wedge salad. The salad was creative and fresh. Pizza was too thin and kind of soggy for my taste, but still tasted good, especially if you like thin pizza. The other day for lunch I tried the grilled chicken sandwich. . The menu is typical but there are a few creative things that stand out. I've never had to wait and the waiters are very attentive and friendly. The interior is surprisingly roomy, casual, comfortable, very clean. Good place for a business lunch or casual dinner. I plan to go back a few more times. They are now serving brunch too!"}
{"text":"This is your basic, not high quality, fake Italian restaurant. 
The chicken was unseasoned, the calamari wasn't crispy, and they gave us a plain pepperoni pizza rather than the one we paid for filled with toppings. The parmesan fries were basic McDonald's fries sprinkled with cheese. We should've known what to expect when it was empty on a Friday night. Would not come back."}
{"text":"Living downtown I always like to check out new places. Being down the street from ASU downtown campus, it was quite convenient for me to stop in and check it out. Looked a little quiet on the patio, but there were a few people inside. Within a minute of setting foot in the restaurant I was greeted by a lovely employee who broke down the menu for me, especially since a majority of it is in Italian. This is a big plus in my book, considering employees give a great impression and feel for places, a greeter makes or breaks my interest in any new food place I try. 

After figuring what I was going to get, the chicken Marsala with a side of spicy tomato pasta, I ordered at one of the cashiering terminals. I was told this concept of \"fast casual\" can be compared to a peiwei or chipotle. The layout it not that specific or guiding, but I didn't mind--the service was prompt. 

The decor is very intriguing and I enjoy how the space is utilized. They also have a coffee bar, with hopes of breakfast in the near future, but it is a little hard to see. My food came out fairly quickly and it was hot and ready! The Marsala sauce was a bit runny, but the taste was exquisite! My chicken was slightly breaded and it was cooked great. My pasta was spicy! Those cooks do not mess around, what you ask for you get! 

I had to get up and order dessert, at least that was suggested because their dessert comes out within minutes. That was a bit of an inconvenience. Anyway, the pizza cookie or pizcotti that I had was the sugar cookie and it was really good. I like my dessert, so the serving size of this dessert was nothing compared to maybe an oregano's pizza cookie. I think if I had to share it I would be a bit upset.

I had a chance to talk a bit to a few employees, due to the down time in the restaurant. Sounds like this little place has plans for a big future. Including breakfast, \"fast casual\" lunch to move through the cityscape businesses, and a full service dinner that is going to be a bit more upscale. I am excited to see the evolution of this place into something even better! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Tried the strand for the first time, atmosphere was clean and had good music but we were sat in an awfully closed in corner. Waitress was a little awkward as though she didn't quite know the menu but was nice and friendly. I ordered the lobster Mac and cheese. I'd give it three stars as well as it was more of a lasagna that was baked in the oven. Portion wasn't big or generous and there wasn't much lobster but it was $16. Wasn't that impressed with the food or staff and most likely will go to another Italian eatery next time."}
{"text":"Solid.

I was looking for something new to do for lunch, and my boss suggested The Strand. having not been fully committed to this place (I'd been here previously and was not impressed), I decided to give it a second chance. And I'm glad I did. Their chicken Parmesan is hugely proportioned with a generous amount of garlic/parm fries. Wasn't even able to finish it. I'm so looking forward to getting a second meal out of this."}
{"text":"This was ok. My kids completely enjoyed their meals. Our server, I think her name was Rachel, was friendly and seemed to know what she was doing. 
I can't put my finger on why this place didn't 'wow' me. Perhaps it's just another tourist spot downtown... Kind of generic. 
App portion of the muscles & clams seemed tiny for more than 1 person."}
{"text":"Went here in Sept '13 and had a great time. I had the lobster Mac n cheese which was great. Good selection of beers and wine. The server was probably the best part! I think her name was Kristen but she was from IL as well and gave us a ton of cool places to try out and bars to go to. She pretty much made our night, I just wish we went there earlier in our trip."}
{"text":"Went for dinner before a Diamindbacks games. It opened at 4 pm Saturday and we were the second party tgere. It started to fill up quickly. Each of us had pasta dishes, baked boulanese with cyeese, spaghetti and meatballs and chicken and pasta. Each was very good. Ate pretty quickly for the fame. Service was excellent, very attentive. Nice downtown dining."}
{"text":"A group of us were in town for a convention and did not want to wait to eat till late after it ended so we ordered this to be delivered while we got ready. 

Service- the order and deliver process was very smooth and easy. Only took about 30/45 minutes before the guy delivered our food. He came up to our hotel room as well so that was nice. 

Food:

Chicken ala vodka- my mom and I shared this and neither of us were impressed. Very bland in flavor. And extremely small portion for the price. I mean for almost $20 an meal it should be a lot tastier and much bigger portion. 

Shrimp Alfredo( I believe this is what it was) - our friend ordered this and again she said it was very bland and needed way more flavor. And also extremely small portion. 

Lobster Mac- our other friend got this and had a stomach ache the rest of the night. She actually left the convention early and stayed in her room the rest of the evening because she felt so sick. Which was a bummer because it was our last night all together. 

I don't want to give it one star because that doesn't seem entirely fair but none of us were impressed. Seemed like a huge rip off. We paid $80 for 4 meals and none of them were the size they should've been. They didn't even cover the bottom of the to go container. Don't think any of us would choose this on our future visits to Phoenix."}
