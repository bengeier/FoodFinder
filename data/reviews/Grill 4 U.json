{"text":"The best Chicken Shawarma I have had. Fatush inside your Shawarma gives you the crunchy feel. Sauces are good. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've been here once before to have the chicken shawarma and I remember it being a lot better the first time. I was actually planning to have beef this time, but it looked like there was barely anything left on the rotisserie (this was only 7:30 pm on a Friday night) so I opted for chicken again. I can vouch that all the ingredients are very fresh and the restaurant is quite clean. However, I do remember the chicken being moist last time when I had it at lunch.  I can honestly say that the shawarma I had tonight was the worst I've ever had. The meat was so dry that it was hard to chew through it, the pita wrap itself was falling apart and even though the sandwich was panini grilled at the end, my sandwich was stone cold. I ordered take out since I only live 5 minutes away, but the sandwich honestly couldn't have cooled up that quickly especially since they put it in an aluminium foil wrap. I finished only half of it since the whole sandwich had fallen apart, the pita has become a soggy mess and I honestly just gave up scooping everything or eating the ingredients separately. I couldn't swallow the meat without having to first drench it with sauce anyway, so what's the point?  Seriously disappointing and will never return."}
{"text":"This place has gone hill. The servers are all smiles all the time but they will short change you on everything  I asked for a beef shawarma wrap. A got bare pickings of lettuce, turnips and tabouli. Zero to none. But hey, I got a smile right? They also do work very hastily.   This place used to be awesome. Now it's meh.  Edit: I went to Extreme Pita (Weston rd/Hwy7) and wow. They put these \"authentic\" shawarma places to utter shame."}
{"text":"Oh, how I miss those guys.Was recommended the place by persian co-workers and it was my go to shawarma place for lunch for 2 yrs until i moved away. Everything is sooo fresh, love their home made pitas and falafels. Generous portions, great service and excellent food. My benchmark for shawarma sandwiches for sure. (Oh..and they sell the yummiest mini-baklavas...absolulutely heavenly)"}
{"text":"Neat and compact, not much seating space but the staff are friendly. I had the falafel wrap and it was amazing. The falafel is so crisp and tasty and the hot sauce was mildly spicy and the vegetables were fresh. Good place for takeout or quick bite if your around Vaughan Mills.  =============================PRIYA========"}
{"text":"Being from middle eastern background I knew how good Shawarma and flafel should taste, and after hearing so much about this place I went to give it a try, I actually had the beef, chicken and the flafel sandwiches. Keeping the topping to minimum (the it has to be, not the way north Americans do it fill with toppings) beef with tahini, tomatoes and onions, chicken  with tahini and tomato, flafel with hummus, pickles and tomatoes (I love tomatoes :) ). Verdict all main ingredients in the sandwiches lacked any flavor and was nothing compared to what I was hoping for"}
{"text":"Been to Grill 4 U 3 times now and it is a hit and miss for me.  The first time was the best as the wrap and meat was nice and hot.  But after that the quality been going downhill from my experience.  The wrap itself was breaking up and cracking when the server was folding it and you can tell it is not fresh and the turnover is not high here.  So all the ingredients were falling out once I start eating it.   It was a big mess. The meat was dry and was tasteless.  They do however give you a fair portion of meat.  I tried both chicken and beef and I like the beef more.  Grill 4 U is a small place with around 5 tables only.  The staff is very friendly and likes to small talk with you and pricing is not bad as well.  Hopefully the next time I go to Grill 4 U the quality will be up to par or I don't think I will return  ever again.

{"text":"Ordered Falafel plate and chicken sandwich. The food taste really good, excellent service. Good place for a quick bite. A bit on the pricy side. Overall good"}
{"text":"Have you heard the Grill4U radio ad?  I have, but that's not how I found this place.  I heard it from a friend and that's why I went looking for a Shawarma place during lunch.  I went in not knowing if it was this place, but through the window I saw the seats were full and there was somewhat a line-up for orders.  When I went inside I noticed there was one side of the resto with about 5 large tables for sit-in but I noticed many were take-out as well since it was a weekday.  The other side was the kitchen/order area with Flatscreens displaying the menu.  I would say this is a casual fast food lunch place, that you go in and out for.  Initially, It looked to me just like any other Shawarma/Falafel fastfood place but while I was trying to be patient in line while the staff freshly prepped the food, I noticed that the couple of young men were quite energetic and talkative/friendly with the awaiting customers.  Watching these guys work in NY-style pace while engaging the customers made the wait time disappear very quickly for me.  I believe most people in line ordered Beef or Chicken Sharwarma, and Falafel.  I had the Beef Sharwarma and I enjoyed it compared to other of the same types of restos.  The sauces were flavourful, the beef was seasoned and still JUICY unlike other places, and they panini-grill it at the end which makes it perfect for holding it in one hand while driving back to work before lunch time ends.  Oh yeah, they use a small electric handsaw to cut the meats from the rotisserie which is COOL and probably much faster than cutting pieces with a knife."}
{"text":"This is a family run business with real home cooking. This is the go to eatery for the middle eastern community in the area and when shopping at Vaughan Mills. They are always able to do a few changes to accommodate you and their ingredients are very fresh."}
{"text":"Have been a few times, hit and miss, sometimes very good but the last time I went got the scraps that were already carved sitting drying out. Very oily also. Eggplant dish was very good!"}
{"text":"I've only had Shwarma's 3 times. Twice here and once at the CNE. I'm not even sure I like shwarmas, but I sure like this place. There's always a line at lunch and there aren't too many tables. The staff is very nice, sometimes hard to understand. I just said yes and ended up with possibly the sauciest shwarma ever made. I got the combo which was about $10 (I think $10.19) and came with a can of pop and a side of rice with sauce on it. The  rice was amazing. I loved it. And the chicken was really good. I ended up scraping all the contents out of my pita and eating it with the rice. I'll for sure be getting that again next time. They also had mushrooms and chicken in some kind of creamy sauce that goes on top of rice. It looked amazing. This is a popular lunch spot and the food is quite good."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma is delicious (be sure to opt for all the sauces: hummus, tahini, garlic, chili). The falafel were some of the best I've had anywhere, crunchy on the outside, moist inside, and with a nice herby flavor."}
{"text":"Everything was fresh and pretty good. I had the beef shwarma plate with a little bit of everything on the veggies. Pricier than typical shwarma places it seems, but they do make it up on the portion. Only complaint on the food is on the potato. It was pretty hard and not so fresh. The place, however was not so clean. There was only one person working there and although there were some down time, he didn't clean the place. Only after we started leaving did he start wiping the tables. We did manage finding the last clean table. Despite the cleanliness, I would come back."}
