{"text":"Went in today for the 1st time lydia greeted me was very friendly, answered all my questions was very patient while I decided what I wanted. Mentioned to her it was my birthday made me a birthday smoothie on the house... Everything I ordered was amazing... will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Wow! I was truly impressed by the quality and service this place provided my family and I on the very first day. We heard about the Grand Opening day and went there. It did NOT disappoint at all. From the moment we walked in we smelled the Phreshness of this new place. I've been there about 7 times since the opening day. The sandwiches and smoothies as well as their fruit bowls are very good. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing time at Phoenix Phresh -- the açaí bowls are so fresh and wraps are to die for. The employees were helpful and the place was spotless clean! You have to give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh ingredients! Quick and friendly service. Will definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"I think I've come in here at least 10 times this month. IM IN LOVE WITH THEIR FOOD. So healthy, so nutritious! I can't wait for them to open a location near me, although I don't mind the drive at all because they're food is so delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place was so delicious and so fresh! I so happy to see something so fresh and yummy open so close to home! I give it a well deserved 10/10"}
{"text":"Super clean and fabulous food here everyone!  I would highly recommend their wraps!  Especially the Southwest one is fabulous.  I have been waiting for a place like this for a long time.  It is in the Safeway shopping center directly across from the doughnut shop at 59th Ave and Thunderbird.  I literally could eat here everyday.  For what most spend on a sugar syrup drink from a popular coffee house, you could eat fabulously healthy organic food.  I had a Acai smoothie that was awesome!  The people that work there and own and operate are very kind and friendly.  You have to try this place, I am a frequent flyer here for sure.  I do not like eating out much and I am very picky.  Try this place, it will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"New place great concept finally a place like nectar on the West valley. This place does the job and they do juicing"}
{"text":"Very clean and fresh like the name says. Had the Phoenix club sandwich, bread was soft. Also had smoothies and bowls. Would most definitely come again."}
{"text":"Such a clean and cute place. The food was delicious the first time i tried it. I had the simply good bowl and went back a couple of days later. I'm trying the power bowl next. Food was so flavorful, service is quick and the staff is so nice. Definitely my new favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"I saw a few people post on social media about this place and decided to try it for lunch today. I had the southwest wrap for lunch and it was really tasty and it was HUGE! It's been a few hours and I'm still full.  I also had a couple bites of my acai bowl and it was phenomenal (I had to take the rest home, to full). If you want healthy and Phresh this is the place to be. It was great customer service (very friendly cashier) and the place was SUPER clean."}
{"text":"The following review is from my personal experience at PhoenixPhresh. I've only tried 2 of their bowls and nothing else. 

My wife and I ordered 2 bowls and there was nothing fresh about them (see photo). Everything in the bowl was processed and my bowl was missing the chipotle sauce and the eggs came out as egg whites even though the menu mentioned that my bowl had eggs and not egg whites like other bowls did. The staff was not personable nor professional, but I just read online that they're a new business (opened this month) and are probably still learning the ropes of the business. I don't know if I'd come back or recommend this spot, but I hope they can improve on a few things. The following are my 2 cents (I really want this new restaurant to succeed.)

1. Use fresh ingredients or change the name of the business so that the customer doesn't expect one thing and get another 

2. Have a system to be more effective in handling more than 1 order. There were 3 groups of people waiting and one group that had already ordered seemed frustrated while waiting then they received their order to go even through they wanted to dine in, and another group was waiting for a few minutes at the register's before someone was there to help 

3. Customer service! Welcoming customers and making sure to communicate and be in relationship/caring will go a long way. 

Again, my intention isn't to hurt this new business, but I hope they hear what their customers have to say and take action."}
{"text":"The food is good and always quick with orders. I recommend if your looking for a healthy place to eat and also relaxing."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and food was great, staff were polite, and I'll definitely be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"So glad to have healthy fresh eats on the WestSide!  Acai bowls,smoothies,salads.  Reasonable prices and great service.  Let's support local small business"}
{"text":"Warning- if you're wanting a healthy smoothie this isn't their specialty. They automatically added a few pumps of syrup flavorings to my smoothie. The Torani syrups they use have additional sugars, and 4 types of color dyes. After I saw the employee adding them I asked her why she did and she told me it's to make the smoothie taste better. Shouldn't your smoothies already taste good since it's made from fruit? She told me the smoothies are too bland with just fruit. The smoothie tasted good, but next time I'll go to Jamba Juice or Tropical Smoothie Cafe where they don't add fake syrup flavor with unnecessary sugars, dyes and preservatives."}
{"text":"I went to this place with an open mind and a vegan friends. We were blown away by the what looked to be a mother and daughter staff and the food was a amazing. It was the right amount of food for the right amount of money. I will go back for sure and have already recommended it to anyone who would listen."}
{"text":"So excited I stumbled upon this place. Great food and sincerely sweet staff. Fresh pressed juice and pitaya smoothie are amazing! Lady working was so kind and made me a sample mini Açaí bowl just so I could taste it"}
{"text":"Food wad mediocre, smoothie was mediocre and the older lady who was working the cash register was extremely rude. Didn't say hi or greet at all. I stood in front of the cash register ready to order, and she proceeded to organize the business cards and ignore me. I asked for a cup of water, and she gives me water straight from their hand washing sink..."}
{"text":"So thankful to have stumbled upon this rare healthy food establishment in Glendale!!

The restaurant is very clean and quaint, it has a very casual vibe to it. The menu is very broad and has a lot of different options. We ordered a Bob Marley Açaí bowl and a spinach wrap, plus a bag of chips. Our total was $17.76, very cheap for the quality of food we were getting!!

The only compliant I have is it did take a little while for the wrap to come out, but considering this establishment is only a month or two old, it's understandable about the wait. Especially since there was only two people working at the time.

Both of us were filled up with our meals, each meal has a great portion sizing. 

Overall, we were very satisfied with our visit to Phoenix Fresh. And cannot WAIT to return!!"}
{"text":"The old lady working the counter is slow, not polite at all and can't make a smoothie to save her life.

If the owner is out there, please get better staff maybe a younger more energetic cashier. The products are all decent enough"}
{"text":"So I've noticed the owner responded back to me. He apologized about my experience and wanted to redeem the restaurant by telling me to bring in my prior review, and they will make it right. Seemed kind of odd someone would say to \"bring in my review\", and after reading ALL of the other reviews the manager did not say this to the other people. Leaves me to believe that it sounds suspect, as if this is a set up. No thanks!"}
{"text":"I hope this place takes off. The food is amazing and the staff are very mice and helpful. I got the Rob's special. The coffee crunch is super good."}
{"text":"Tucked in a little strip mall by a Safeway store and a couple of other restaurants phoenix pfresh lives up to its name. The food is made fresh so it may take a minute.  my husband had the Caesar wrap with chicken (made with canned chicken) And I had the make your own wrap.  Both were heated on a grill, but did not warm the inside ingredients. Smoothies were made fresh and very good. A definite place for a light lunch. Will have to come back and try their breakfast!"}
{"text":"Wish I remembered to take a picture before my husband and I demolished our food! It was delicious! For dinner we shared a bowl and a wrap, and shared an açaí bowl for dinner. As someone who enjoys fresh, whole food and cares about the ingredients I put in my body....this place was perfect! Very reasonable prices, great options, and quick service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Walked in on an extremely busy day I was having, wanting to get an acai bowl. Heard about this new health food place and thought that they would be allergy friendly. As soon as I walked in I asked this lady very nicely if they had any gluten free options. She said no, and that's it! Nothing else was said. So me and my boyfriend just looked at her awkwardly and just walked out. The one star isn't because they \"didn't have\" any gluten free options, which, I really think that they do, because acai is gluten free. But it's the thing that she didn't even say have a good day or apologize. Or atleast direct me to another place or offer my boyfriend something on the menu. Very sad. Was very excited for this place."}
{"text":"Such amazing service and food! The food is as fresh as the name! They customize to your choice and taste, and they always make sure the food is up to your liking. The owners are such kind people! Come and eat Fresh with Phoenix Phresh!"}
{"text":"OMG!! The best sandwiches and açai I've ever had.... highly recomended the place also has its unique beauty and the music is nice and  different than usual. The smoothies are great and all natural too.  I asked and they said that they don't add any sweetness to their smoothies which I love because most of the places now add tons of sugar to make it teast good."}
{"text":"Had a Hercules wrap recently and it was DELICIOUS!  Super tasty and healthy.  I wish they opened earlier because I would stop in before work for an acai bowl.  We went there at a time when we couldn't tell if they were open yet or not, no signage on the door, and the windows are so tinted that it looked closed.  I'm sure they will have signage on the door soon - they probably had just opened for business and haven't gotten that far yet. Also - the acai and smoothie menu is above the counter, the wrap and sandwich menu is on the wall to the left.  I will def be back to try more of the menu.  Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This new cafe opened up by our work. Got a little excited on their menu. Tried it today for the first time, and we will definitely go back. Had the Hawaiian açaí aloha in a pineapple, and it was delicious. Friend had a turkey sandwich and said it was great. We can't wait to try other items on the menu since they all look intriguing. Definitely a good stop for fresh food."}
{"text":"Very nice place! I got the quinoa black bean wrap and it was fresh & delish! The staff there were also nice and helpful. I would go back!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. It's so rePHRESHING. I absolutely love that we have a place that offers fresh and healthy options. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting a delicious and healthy meal, smoothie, açaí bowl or a fresh juice!"}
{"text":"Love this local business, the food is always fresh and so delicious! I've never had an açaí bowl and I'm happy I tried it here! This place definitely keeps you on track when looking for a healthier option!"}
{"text":"Foods amazing and the smoothies are super fresh and delicious!!!  I will definitely be returning soon"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! They have awesome smoothies that they actually use fresh fruit for (unlike most popular protein smoothie joints). Their wraps are really good and come toasted automatically. I've had the Mediterranean and Caesar wrap, bother we're great. The coffee crunch protein smoothie is really good. Best part is, it's family owned and operated!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite and I was very satisfied! We had the southwest wrap and chef salad, they were both delicious. The dressing on the salad was creamy with a hint of heat, so good. I highly recommend this place for their sandwiches and salads. Their smoothies all sound amazing too, I will definitely be back to try them!"}
{"text":"The owner has reached out and there is definitely latitude for a change of rating and always a change of mind. 

The eatery is only two weeks old and I knew that there are things to work out!

The good news is that the owner is willing to accept feedback and respond! 

I wish this business all the success!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I had the turkey Pesto sandwich and it was delish! The staff is so friendly. A much needed addition to the area. I will be back for sure."}
