{"text":"If you've ever driven by High Park on Bloor street, seen the street-level sign that advertises 3 dollar breakfast, and considered stopping in to check it out, you're probably lucky you didn't. Sure, I know the breakfast is only 3 dollars, so I probably shouldn't be hard on it; but regardless of price, I'd still like my meal to be served hot and be put together with some level of care and attention.  This is a pretty mediocre breakfast here: a slice of warm ham, a strip of old bacon, browned toast, over/undercooked eggs, leftover potatoes, breakfast served here is less-than-spectacular, and the service staff doesn't seem to care if you complain about it; I'm sure they've heard it all countless times before.  All of this, of course, is served in one Toronto's prized possessions, High Park. If it wasn't for the location, I certainly would have given them 1 star. In fact, it wasn't for the location, I probably wouldn't have eaten there at all. And in some strange way, I almost wish I didn't eat there. That way, the ad on Bloor street could have remained some mystical promise of a tasty, hot, and friendly-served breakfast somewhere in the heart of High Park."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast experience of my life. The service was horrible, and the food horrible. I was seated on the patio and after waiting for 20 min I finally got menus. After a long wait and a rude waitress, my food came. I asked for overmedium eggs and received 3 absolutely raw eggs. The eggs were not even over easy, they were raw. All the \"egg whites\" were still completely clear and the yolk was cold and still had a film over it. The pancake that came with the meal was soaked in the raw egg. And when I was brought a new plate they just moved the same cold bacon ham and sausage on the same plate. I could not eat this meal. The rubbery eggs and the cold meat did not sit well with me. On top of that they asked me to choose from a selection of different toast, and when they brought the meal they gave me the wrong one. Not even informing me of why my order was different. I would not recommend to ever get breakfast here. I still feel sick, 6 hours later. My boyfriend got a steak which was also absolutely awful, almost 90% grissle. This $40 meal was not worth a penny. Maybe the hot dogs are better but stay far far away from the breakfasts!!!!"}
{"text":"Bad restaurant with rude staff that serve cold coffee, with no refills, only reason I wanted a refill was that my original up of coffee was served luke warm.  Terrible place that optimizes on location and opportunity."}
{"text":"This place is so disappointing. I agree with the reviewer who said the one thing it has going for it is its location. I've been here quite a few times because I live very nearby. I like to take my laptop and work in the cafe in the winter time - the ambiance is lovely! But the food! The coffee is mediocre, and everything else I've tried is just so meh. This morning we had breakfast there. Fries/potatoes are from frozen. Sausages are incredibly processed. Eggs are rubbery, no salt or pepper on them or on the tables outside. My fruit dish - the melons were a funny off-colour and the grapefruit pieces looked like they'd gone through a shredder. It was all so unappealing and then I got thinking about the Kitchen Nightmares episodes with nasty kitchens, untrained or uncaring staff, low food standards, etc. This place could use a real redo. Is there nobody in charge who really cares about the quality? It could be SO MUCH BETTER. It's got to be one of the prettiest locations to eat in the city; that's why I feel it's such a pity.  On one of my recent visits I ordered soup and found a hair. I told one of the young waiters, and he said, 'Oh, really?' and never offered to take it away, to replace it, never suggested I ask for another one... nothing. Who trains these staff???  Outside, the patio chairs and tables look cheap, dated, old, faded and awful. And yet we ordered coffee and sat there because it's so lovely under the trees.   I don't know what's happening, but I wish this place got an owner who really cherished it. I wish it was me!"}
{"text":"How is this place still in business? Went today and ordered the spanakopita  and asked it to be heated only to learn that this meant putting it into the microwave!!! Bathroom was disgusting, girls didn't seems to care when I address this with them before our meal. Bathroom still in same condition 35 minutes later. Guess the very immature girls behind the counter didn't want their job to cut into their socializing. Never again. It's a shame b/c the location is a gem."}
{"text":"I went to the Grenadier Cafe for lunch. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and great location. Our server was friendly and the grilled cheese w/h fries and veggie sandwich ( also with a side of fries) were delicious, though I did find that the menu was short of vegetarian options. The food arrived quickly. Our group left in great spirits and would happily return after a walk through High Park."}
{"text":"The Grenadier Cafe and Teahouse (formerly the less-pretentious Grenadier Restaurant, and still known as such to old fogies like me who remember what it was like before the \"new management\") has been a fixture in High Park. The coin-op, table-top Pac-Mac machine is finally gone, and the decor is now a little more, uh, tea-housey. Which is for the best, I suppose.  The menu has expanded and improved to all your yuppy favourites, although they still do greasy-spoon standards like bacon and eggs breakfasts. Service and quality seems to vary depending on when you go.  However, the best part remains the wooden deck/patio, which, in the summer, has its own service, and even an ice-cream booth. It's a nice place to relax and watch some of the other doings in the middle of the park. Like the real estate guys say: location, location, location."}
{"text":"I think a five-year-old could prepare a better brunch than the folks at Grenadier Cafe. The owners of this establishment must be rolling in dough - seriously - head there on any nice weekend, and there are lineups through the park for a table on their dirty, bug-infested patio.  The service is super slow, and the food is awful. Greasy eggs, half-toasted, super buttery, Wonder Bread-style toast. Don't go there.  Bring a picnic. Stop by the farmer's market, or just skip greasy breakfast, and over-indulge on two ice cream cones."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I stopped by the Grenadier Cafe after a bike ride in High Park. We were thinking it wasn't the best place for breakfast, but we decided to settle for a quick bite.   Everything was mediocre. Food was prepared in cafeteria-style, which means everything was lukewarm when it was on the table. I ordered an English-style bangers with eggs. The bangers were a bit burnt, but still edible. Some of their desserts were from Subway, and the juices are bottled, brand-name companies. For the both of us, we spent $15 on breakfast, which is a little more than you would spend on your local greasy spoon.   I managed to try bits of most things, but as soon as I sliced opened the third over-easy egg on my plate, there was a BLOODY residue in my egg yolk.   A FERTILIZED EGG served in a restaurant that claims to be famous for its breakfast!!!! Disgusting!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and quality eats for a very low price. I am only talking about Breakfast here.  If you get here early enough you can get eggs, bacon, homefries and toast for the price of $3.99. You can't beat that."}
{"text":"Eating desserts here is definitely a waste of calories. I was also disappointed by cappuccino."}
{"text":"Table service is pretty horrible.  Go for the counter service, with much nicer cashiers, and you won't have to wait forEVER.  The breakfast here is ok, although greasy, but I don't know what you would have to do to manage to get it for the advertised $2.99,  I  certainly haven't ever managed to get eggs here for anywhere near that price.  The stars are for the kick-ass location.  Also anytime I've tried to eat dinner here, the food was horrible.   I always forget how horrible, and because I love the park, and am often here, I try once a year or so, and am always reminded that it is awful.  Stick to the breakfast, and expect to pay double what it says on the sign on the road, and it'll be ok."}
{"text":"I like the breakfest.... but the hash brown portions are WAY to small."}
{"text":"Location and patio = amazing! Food = not bad Prices = crazy over priced I wouldn't recommend this place for a meal but it's the perfect summer time spot for an ice cream or a snack. The space inside is ugly and dark but the huge patio is awesome."}
{"text":"Ordered the all day breakfast. 3 eggs, toast and potatoes. $4.99 (weekend). Was all done well.  The atmosphere reminded me of the restaurant at the Grand Canyon, USA, minus the Grand Canyon. I figured out later it was because it felt really touristy in there.  They have 3 areas to eat: 1) Outdoor deck facing the park's greenery 2) cafeteria style (line up to order, get a number, your food is brought to you) 3) seating area to be waited on."}
{"text":"i only come here for the ice cream. It's usually on a hot summer day and i just want ice cream to walk around the park with. In terms of food i haven't tried it and i don't think i ever will.   It's some pricey ice cream though. haha"}
{"text":"Inconsistent service, food reminiscent of 1980's hospital cafeteria fare, and high prices  To compare the French fries to cardboard would be an insult to corrugates everywhere.   The hot dog, hamburger and kid's nugget meals all seem to have come out of the local no-frills grocery store's frozen section.   Out waitress was pretty but seemed stunned. Other wait staff were just pretty stunned."}
{"text":"The best thing about this cafe is the location. The food & service are mediocre at best. That's what happens when there is no competition around."}
{"text":"I would give this place negative stars, if possible.    If you don't want to read the review, here's the takeaway: This place is staffed by a mean-spirited, hostile hostess and it is organized VERY poorly, which negatively affects both customers and staff.  AVOID!  Where to begin? I went here with my fiance and her parents recently.  The place was bustling, which is usual for a weekend brunch place.  The problem, though, is that the staff are rude and unfriendly.  I suspect that this has much to do with the complete lack of organization in the place.    Case in point: We waited for about 20 minutes in a line that snaked around the interior of the waiting room, partially blocking busboys and waitresses who were trying to carry dishes into and out of the main dining area.  This was frustrating for both customers and staff; customers were uncomfortable standing in a long line and staff were uncomfortable carrying plates (sometimes a bunch) through this congested line.    You could really see it in the faces of staff.  Not a single person was smiling, which to me is a BASIC aspect of customer service.    Meanwhile, staff were not sitting customers at 6-7 OPEN tables in the immediate vicinity.  For some reason, this place has reserved these for a \"take out\" part of their restaurant, which makes no sense.  Why make customers wait in a line that makes servers' jobs that much more difficult?  Why not seat some of the people waiting to dine in?  At some point, there were people literally sitting and checking their cell phones at these tables, while the line continued to disrupt the flow of foot traffic coming into and out of the kitchen.  Management must not care much about customers or staff, because everyone in this situations was frustrated and unhappy.    These are all unpleasant aspects of this place, but the real downside came in the form of a rude, passive aggressive hostess.  After a long wait, we finally made it to the front of the line.  The hostess signalled for a different parties to enter the dining area.  A bunch of people walked in and we followed, thinking that we had also been queued into the restaurant (keep in mind that the floor was very congested and confusing and chaotic).  Once we walked in, we realized that we had made a mistake and were yelled at and chastised by this hostess who started commiserating with a customer about us; she then told us we could leave saying, \"There's the door\" and \"I think you should leave\".  And to top it all off, she said with the most passive aggressive smile, \"Happy Mother's Day!\"    I will never frequent this place again.  At the end of the day, there are so many places where you can go for brunch that don't have a hostile and mean-spirited staff.  Ownership should be ashamed that they haven't created an efficient way to seat customers.  This is unfair to customers and staff, who were obviously very stressed out by the foot traffic in and around the kitchen.  And, ultimately, ownership should think twice about hiring rude and mean-spirited people.  Avoid this place and go somewhere that has a friendlier staff and a working model for sitting/serving customers."}
{"text":"Decent enough for breakfast/brunch and the location can't be beat. However, all the servers seem to be disinterested teens, and the frozen pub grub that gets served for lunch/dinner is not very appetizing. Drivers beware - the parking lot next to the Grenadier is perpetually jammed in summer. On our last visit to High Park we spent 12 minutes driving there and 20 minutes cruising for parking. I suppose it was divine justice for not taking the TTC over."}
{"text":"Without question one of the worst meals I've ever had.  Packed full of people because it's the only restaurant in High Park, the Grenadier has really gone slack on their customer service / quality of food.   50+ minute wait for food (breakfast food), non-apologetic wait staff, wrong orders, coffee that tasted like horse piss.   negative 5 pats out of a possible positive 5 pats  taptaptaptaptap"}
{"text":"I live very close to High Park and I have gone to Grenadier Cafe for their early bird specials with my family a few time on various Saturdays. They give you large portions of food especially for $3.99 a plate,it is guaranteed to make your stomach VERY full. I like the scrambled eggs with ketchup part the best. However, I would suggest that you only come for the early bird special because the food is overpriced during regular times. I tried the eggs benedict once and they ruined one of the eggs and it costed over $11, which wasn't worth it. Other than the eggs benedict, the food has always been delicious every time I came."}
{"text":"Great value for your money . Where else can you get steak and eggs for $9.99 After  your your Breakfast  you can go for a great walk in High Park"}
{"text":"Yup, this place bustles, even at 9:30 on a Wednesday morning.  Unlike many others, my group and I managed to get the 2.99 breakfast.  I didn't ask any questions...just backed away from the cash and raced to a table.  Oh yeah, you place your order at the cash and take a number stand to a table.  Service is very quick, so don't dawdle on the way, or the server may beat you there.  The food was acceptable, but don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"I know that I'll go there again, but only for the location... Well, I might be back for breakfast.   I've eaten there a number of times and other than the corned beef on rye & omelets I don't think I've had a \"good\" entree.   Its often crowded and noisy inside, but there's a large patio outside - nothing spectacular, but it is in High Park"}
{"text":"Desperate need of a renovation to fix how people move through the place, chaotic and long lines. The coffee is poor but the cakes are decent and the patio is nice in summer."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place to go for a bite after a day in the park but I think it is under new management. The owner and the staff are very rude, the food is mediocre and overpriced. You're better off bringing a picnic."}
{"text":"What's with the harsh reviews? This place is awesome!!! It's right in the midts of high park  with the best view and great wrap around patio with a view that can't be beat! Prices are very fair.. I got a good sized steak sandwich for only 10 bucks! It had great flavour and hit the spot! It's the perfect meal for after a long walk in high park! Service is lovely and friendly. The overall experience was lovely and worth a meal when visiting high park! It's not fancy by any means, but it's delicious, hits the spot bad is comfortable dining experience.They're slammed on weekends so go in a weekday and it'll be no wait!"}
{"text":"The Park and a great little place for breakfast make for a perfect day to start summer."}
{"text":"Grenadier Cafe does have one BIG thing going for it. Location! A beautiful big patio with a fantastic view in High Park.  I've been here a few times. It's good, but not great. Although they do something spectacular to the bacon that comes with the breakfast. I don't know what it is, but it's friggin' delicious! Everything else is average. I could give this place 3 stars if the service was better. The sure do take their sweet time to serve you.  Part of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order at the counter, they give you a number for your table, you go find a spot to sit and they come find you when your food is ready. One time when we ordered breakfast it actually came pretty quickly. But i did have to hunt down a waitress to re-fill the water in my teapot. After they give you the food, they kind of just forget about you.   The other section of the restaurant is the normal waiter served area. There is also a patio for that section too. I've been on that side of things a couple times and it took FOREVER for my order to be taken. When I finally got my food, my friends food didn't come. We thought it would be out in a minute. Nope. The waitress forgot to place that order. So we had to wait again... I was practically done before my friend got their meal. And again, the food was okay, but nothing great. I'll probably give Grenadier Cafe another shot, in hopes that i can improve my review. We'll see...."}
{"text":"Grenadier has a $3.99 breakfast Monday-Friday and it is pretty good! Not a whole lot to complain about when it has that price attached to it! One thing I love about Grenadier is the location and the coffee-always hot and fresh!   If you are looking for a great (ie- thick bacon, perfectly cooked eggs, homemade toast) breakfast I maybe wouldn't suggest this place, but it is awesome when in a time pinch or to drop in while touring the park!"}
{"text":"I really like eggs Benedict breakfast here. It is properly done and tasty with home made fries which is a great complement."}
{"text":"I can't vouch for the food quality or variety of this café both of which seemed passable however the location in the middle of high park is excellent. Prices are reasonable.  My friends and I chilled out on the veranda area while eating burgers. Excellent people watching and you are surrounded by the trees of the park.  Being honest what keeps this place in business is the awesome location. I hope management realizes how awesome this place would be with new design and better food!"}
{"text":"It's a great location, but the food is bland and overpriced.  Table service is slow.  The decor has seen better days; what is good ain't new (the tree), and what is new ain't good (the awkward-suburban tchotchke-shelves).  If you're in the park already, fine, but I wouldn't make a special trip or anything."}
{"text":"The ultimate breakfast.  Two eggs, pancake, sausages, Newport striploin,  peameal bacon, home fries and toast.  Enoyed it thoroughly after a walk around the mini zoo.  Little pricey and crowded. But worth a visit for their all day breakfasts or their thin crust stone baked pizzas.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"High Park is for sure one of the best parks here in Toronto. Grenadier is decent but don't have too much high expectations for this cafe.   The reason I give this 3 stars is because of the horrible customer service from their workers. I understand fast-food and customer service jobs are hard to do since I work at McDonald's but giving there is no need in giving attitude to customers who genuinely try to be nice or ask for some assistance.   The food is a little over priced but you save money on tips because it's optionally since they don't really service you besides bringing food to your table. Since there is a dining room also part of the cafe but that is with service (waitresses, waiters etc.)  However, what I enjoy is their all day breakfast menu. This is perfect for breakfast lovers that wake up in the afternoon and go to the park for a nice walk. The pizza and souvlaki here is also amazing.   The tables are often clean and there is also outdoor seating so coming here in the summer is the best.  Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm not as dissapointed as this place met my very low expectations. It's a park restaurant, not a fancy place you dream of going or one that makes awesome anything.  Their breakfast is decent, when you get the $2.99 special but even when you pay the full price around $7, it's still reasonable.   The coffee sucks and any other entrees will run you about $10 a plate.   The patio is great and the little ice cream shop is open in the summer time!"}
{"text":"This place is dry for one.  It's the only restaurant in the park, so no competition, and it shows.  Unless you are starving with no other options, avoid this place."}
{"text":"Good food, service model can be confusing for first timers. And line up to order overwhelming.There is a separate area where the wait staff will take your order at your seat, but I believe that there is a mandatory tip for this section."}
{"text":"A bustling, busy institution. This place does the basics well and you can't beat the location. The breakfast items are what you would expect and the lunch and dinner options are done well. Busy but they get through the line pretty fast and there is counter service as well. Good choice."}
{"text":"I went over to High Park this past week to have breakfast at Grenadier Cafe, and it was enjoyable as always. The food is okay, similar to what you would have at any breakfast place in Toronto, but I also like the atmosphere of the whole place. There is a take-out section in the front, but I normally have a seat to relax in the wait service section. The ceiling has a painting of clouds in the sky, and there is dark wood trim and furniture, with a few booths by the windows. One wall has some old pictures with descriptions of the area from the past. The service is usually friendly, and fairly fast since I generally go after the morning/weekend rush. Overall, it gives a nice quiet nostalgic feel.  As for food, they serve the usual egg breakfasts, omelettes, French toast, as well as general diner fare (salads/sandwiches/burgers). I mostly have breakfast there, and this time chose the eggs benedict with home fries and coffee. The food is good but nothing special, much like a breakfast I would make myself at home. I do enjoy their desserts however, again a nostalgic throwback to old diners, and I had a nice piece of carrot cake to finish this time. The total bill was $22, so about average (considering that I usually don't have dessert elsewhere).  A strong recommendation based on my overall experience, including a separate 5-star review of the park itself on the High Park page!!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful location. The egg breakfasts were done perfectly. Coffee refills a little slow."}
{"text":"The food taste is terrible for the price.  My IDs love a hot dog, jello and chocolate cake.  Not here, they disliked it all.  How does someone mess up jello? My daughter said it tasted terrible.  I had the French onion soup.  The bread was mushy and I couldn't eat it.  Ordered the souvlaki. The salad was wilted and grocery store premix dressing.  It's too bad. The location is great and the ambiance is nice.  The server was very friendly.  But the food - not good.  My husband had a breakfast plate and that seemed good."}
{"text":"Great early bird breakfast special. Price did increase a year or two ago but at $4.99 it's still a good deal!  They are fast, large portions, parking is free and for simple breakfast with eggs, bacon/sausage/ham with home fries and toast it's just simple standard fare at good prices.  One thing don't really like is coffee does not have free refills. Guess that's the fee you get for low food prices."}
{"text":"Nice spot for a coffee and a walk through the park.  Centrally located so you can stroll in any direction."}
{"text":"This place gets an extra star for being right in the middle of the High Park.  It reminds me of that restaurant that you find at every provincial park.  The food is okay and oddly southern.  Their specials include waffles and BBQ chicken... or deep fried shrimp... or deep fried anything I guess.  Choose from either cafeteria style or a please wait to be seated section.  The $2.99 breaky is pretty good as is the $6.99 Big Breakfast.  Have lunch, then walk through the park.  Watch out for Coyotes though.  Apparently there are coyote in the park.  Really.  There are even signs."}
{"text":"Well, I've been to High Park so many times in my life, and I can honestly say that I haven't eaten at the restaurant until not too long ago, because many people told me that restaurant is very expensive.  I ordered two $10.99 sandwiches for my mother and I and we were a little worried that we were being over charged until we saw that it came with fries!  We were relieved and happy at the same time, so it turned out well, and we will possibly come back in the future (spring, of course).  Their coffee is pretty much the same as other coffee places.  PS: I posted a picture on how delicious my lunch looked on Instagram."}
{"text":"For $4-5 breakfast it's about what you'd expect. No point coming if you don't make the early bird special though.   Food is decent, decent portions, fast service .. Although you do order at the counter.   Everything's generally good except for the bitchy older waitress"}
{"text":"Breakfast at High Park! This place is so convenient especially after a run or cherry blossoms viewing. Got here around 9AM on a Saturday and it was packed. They have a to-go cafeteria, sit-in area and patio. I opted for the sit-in. It had friendly staff, quick service and just awesomeness. The food had decent prices. Went with the traditional breakfast - 3 eggs, sausage, hash and toast for $6.99. Coffee is $2.49 with free refills. The food was alright - no complaints! The atmosphere is a bonus because it was boosting everyone's energy. It was alive! It is totally a great place for families and kids."}
{"text":"I can only speak to the breakfast at Grenadier and it truly is A-OK. We go here often on weekends just because it's close to home and a great place to take kids. We always go to the back in the full service dine-in section because I can't bear the chaos in the self-service café. In summer there is a nice full service outdoor area as well. The location really is beautiful - there's just something about being in High Park.  I usually order the Traditional Breakfast, which is quite substantial -- eggs, bacon, homefries (yum!), and toast. My hubby gets the Big Breakfast which also comes with bacon, sausage and ham, and a pancake. We don't even bother ordering anything for our 6-year-old because it is that much food. They bring us an extra plate and the kid gets the pancake and some toast, homefries and meat from our orders. The one odd thing though is that it is absolutely forbidden to substitute any of the meat in the Big Breakfast. If you don't like ham, too bad!  I've always found the service prompt and courteous in the dining room. We regularly get the same server and she's really lovely. We've never had a bad meal or experience so would recommend.   We've never had lunch or dinner at the Grenadier (there's no alcohol!) so can't comment there. But the menu is HUGE."}
{"text":"This is not the best breakfast choice on weekends, as they up the prices and one can get better elsewhere.  But for those who are not working weekdays, the cheap breakfast menu is great.  You can eat cafeteria style or sit down in the dining room for the same price.  I usually order the spinach and feta omelet, which is quite tasty.  The food is not four star, but it is wholesome and good and the park atmosphere is very pleasant.  Note that coffee is not unlimited - refills are $.79  Have not tried other meals here.  As it is very informal, this is also a good place for those dining solo."}
{"text":"We've eaten at The Grenadier a few times this year and it's been pretty good.  Definitely feels like you're eating at a city-run cafeteria but overall, it fits well into High Park and the food is pretty good and very reasonably priced.  You can self-serve or have table service (which we opted for).  I find the indoor part very dark and in need of a facelift.  However, the last time we were there, my son ordered a hot dog and fries from the kids menu for the first time.  It was definitely not kid-sized and definitely not geared towards kids.  It was a HUGE hotdog... I would even say it was a sausage and it had a very heavy and strong smoky taste to it.  Not what I imagined it would be and definitely not attractive to a kid.  Needless to say, he had one bite and ended up eating the fries for lunch... and it's not that he's a picky eater....he was hungry and loves hotdogs.  But real hotdogs aimed at kids not this huge strong tasting thing.  Also... it was a gorgeous day outside so we sat on the patio which was infested with bees (or wasps? I don't know the difference...either way, take warning - it was really bad!).  Our table was in the sun near the fence with flowers and it was particularly bad; to the point that there was no way we would be able to eat there were so many of these little buggers attacking us.  As our lunch arrived, I asked to move to the upper deck into the shade and was met with a snotty response from this teenage girl who worked there.  She said \"they're everywhere\" and grudgingly moved us.  Funny, we didn't encounter any of these pests in the shade.  I had to ask her for cutlery for our lunch which she brought along with her attitude.  I've noticed before that service is hit and miss here and today, it was definitely a miss.  Overall though, I would return... it's a good place to have breakfast or lunch in a beautiful park."}
{"text":"Akin to an IKEA-style cafeteria, the Grenadier Cafe is decent for what it is: a clean place to grab a bite when you're in the vicinity of High Park but forgot to pack a sandwich.  Will your hunger be satisfied? You bet. The portions are generous.   Will you feel like you are having a nice picnic in the park? Unfortunately not because of its proximity to a high-traffic road.   In terms of food choices, they have a bit of everything. There is the usual breakfast fare: eggs, sausages, omelettes, breakfast sandwiches, pancakes and waffles. Then you also have pizza, steak, pasta, burgers, atlantic salmon, soup and salad to choose from, as well as some options for kids. The variety is astounding, considering the size of their kitchen.  At the end of the day, you can't help but weep at the missed opportunity. For such a beautiful and unique locale, we have the potential for a real wow moment: a Michelin quality restaurant inside a nature setting. Instead I have to be thankful that something is better than nothing."}
{"text":"The Grenadier Cafe has one really good thing going for it: it's the only restaurant in High Park.  The food is mediocre, the prices acceptable and it seems to always be busy - and a bit of a mess in the seated restaurant area.  In the summer there are two patio options: the cafeteria style one where you pay ahead and get a number to put on your table on the patio and another one with full waiter service.  These are really nice options on warm spring days and makes the inside feel dark and dusty.  It's not bad.  But it's not good either.  It's fine.  Just fine.  Would I come back? Sure.  Would I make it a destination?  Not really.  The park is a destination.  This is just a convenient spot to get a basic coffee and some food if you're hungry.  I've eaten here 3 times for breakfast and was always left thinking \"meh...\""}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with this restaurant. I thought it would be a tourist trap but it wasn't. The prices were fair and the food was good but nothing to write home about. Always choose to dine in instead of lining up at the take-out counter and then having to find your own table. Plus, there is a separate washroom for those who dine in - there is no line up. If it's hot outside, sit in the patio - there didn't appear to be AC inside the restaurant. I can't say I would make a trip from the east end just to eat here but if you're in High Park and find yourself hungry, tired, or needing to use the facilities - I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place - you get what you pay for.  That has always been the way of the Grenadier Cafe.    However, there was always a good breakfast special.  Even on the weekends - if you were there before 11, you could have an acceptable meal without breaking the bank - and there was free coffee.  This is no more.    Monday - Friday before 11 you can still grab yourself the $2.99 special, but for most people who work that's just not attainable.  And with the weekend special gone, there's really nothing calling you anymore.  Early to noon on a Saturday the local running groups meet up, and discuss all the proper tights, and strides, and other such things to move quickly.  So, if you're looking to break into that circle, this might be a good hang out.  Otherwise, move on.  I've been twice in two weeks, because it used to hold charm for me.  But that was a couple of years back now.  Now, I just see the fake tree - not as an adventure - but as something collecting dust that could spill into my meal at any time.    The eggs aren't the best - but they're not the worst.  And while they may no longer have pitchers of water you can pour from, yourself, they do provide each table with a bottle of ketchup.  In the glory days you had to squeeze what little you could out of the packets.   So - there's that one benefit - ketchup for all.  The burgers?  M'eh...  skip it.  Dry.  That's what they are.  And they're not cheap either.  Ten bucks for a burger and fries?  There are enough specialty places around.   Still - if I'm up at 8:00, without work, Monday to Friday - I know where I'll be heading for breakfast..."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about three times now in the past few years - often out of convenience since it's in a great location in High Park, it has ample free parking (though this easily gets filled on weekends) and it's such a short walk to the amphitheatre where Shakespeare in High Park performances take place.   The inside of the café is cute with lots of plants everywhere, several tables and booths, and the layout is simple and straightforward. The patio is a cute place to hang out for mains, drinks or treats like ice cream which is just a few steps away. Sometimes, the patio is not the cleanest in the summer with bird droppings and greasy looking tables all around but if you can look past it and just enjoy the great location, it's not so bad.  There are several food options here from all day breakfast options such as omelettes, breakfast sandwiches, benedicts, and egg/meat plates. There is also a good selection of typical pub food like burgers, fish and chips, soups, salads, pizza, etc.   I particularly like their grilled cheese sandwich with bacon in it - good ol' comfort food for $6 with tax, which is what I ordered again a few days ago! Their burgers and fries for about $11 is also decent. Their fries are crispy, lightly seasoned and delicious in their potato goodness!  Service is friendly and efficient enough as well. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but again, it's decent food when you're hungry and happen to be in High Park."}
{"text":"They have the so-advertised 2.99 all-day breakfast. That's obviously not true. The 2.99 plate is only available until a certain hour (I believe 11am) and does not include coffee.   All the menu options are incredibly unhealthy, so, RUN AWAY FAST if you're on a diet or something. The food tastes as expected and their coffee is default. Nothing you will regret, but maybe you will find better options on Bloor West Village."}
{"text":"Had the all day breakfast here. It was delicious. I ordered the create your own omelette which came with a 3 egg omelette, toast and homefries. In my omelette I had mushrooms, bacon and Swiss cheese, the bread and home fries. The home fries were great. Best I've ever had. The omelette was alright but nothing different then what I've had at other places. But I would say that it was good value for the price."}
{"text":"This place will suck any kind of festive fun you came with. Try to avoid if possible. Feel bad for those who work here as they are clearly miserable  Terribly confusing system with the cafe pick up and the dine in option. Service is pretty terrible. Was not greeted or acknowledged as we waited to be seated. We finally got a table and they tell us the \"computer\" is down so they can't take our order. Okay, sure. Some old lady in line wanted some tea and she wanted to ask where she could get some. The dude at the counter was quite rude with her as well.   ."}
{"text":"Nice dinner stop before Shakespeare in High Park. Order at the counter & they bring your food out. Variety of menu items. Had breakfast, burger, and salad! Everyone got what they liked."}
{"text":"It was an okay breakfast...I wouldnt even say it was \"good\". Hate to say it, but you can get a much better breakfast at the bigger chains like eggsmart (im definitely a proponent of supporting small businesses)  Theyre running a sort of local monopoly. I believe the only other food offered in that part of the park is an adjacent hot dog stand. Thats why they wont refill your coffee for free. Otll vost you another $2 and change!! Call me cheap, but its kind of a standard thing at breakfast places...come on, if you paid almost $40 for two breakfats you'd expect a coffee refill too."}
{"text":"This cafe is extremely frustrating. It's a total gong show on the weekends and you'll be very lucky to find a table. The staff can be pretty rude and really I can't blame them because they look so overworked and frazzled.  As for the food - it's not good. Expect frozen chicken, iceberg lettuce, gravies and sauces from dry packages. Basically anything you would think can be microwaved or deep fried quickly. I stick to the poutine when I am absolutely starved for food in High Park and must have something. Anything other than fries or a hot dog and you are asking for trouble. The prices are absurd for what you get. $11 for a club sandwich, $7 for a western, etc..  The reason I say this cafe is frustrating is because High Park is gorgeous and amazing. But why are we stuck with this awful, 1970s truck stop style cafe and cuisine? It's embarrassing for the city. I'm embarrassed to take visitors from out of town here and try to avoid it at all costs. I wish the city would let some food trucks into the park or let someone else take over the lease of the space. I can't believe the Grenadier Cafe still exists with this kind of food, and this service in 21st century Toronto. And in the middle of one of the lovliest spots in the city no less."}
{"text":"I've been attending the Yoga in the Park event, almost every Sunday during the summer. I'd come here for brunch right after the Yoga practice with my cousin.  This is such a convenient place for all day breakfast.   What we didn't like was being surrounded by bees as we ate in the patio. You have to constantly battle them as you pour maple syrup on your pancake.   We enjoyed the pancakes (thick and fluffy), the omelettes (probably my favourite) and the Eggs Benedict (3 stars for quality in my opinion, which means it's neither super great, nor bad to get a low rating) The coffee is not strong at all. I usually have coffee at Starbucks and the Grenadier coffee definitely didn't deliver my daily dose of caffeine.  The line ups are usually long, the prices are average and service is average."}
{"text":"Don't have super high expectations for this restaurant and you won't be disappointed! I  think this is still a homey feeling neighbourhood restaurant in the heart of high park. It fits with the park - I mean, I can't really picture a modern or high end restaurant in the park. I've been here a few times for the weekday breakfast schedule. You can't get any cheaper than $3.99 for a full breakfast (2 eggs, 3 sausages, home fries and 2 slices of toast). Coffee is about $2 (no refills unfortunately but is quite tasty.). You order at the counter, take a number, and a server brings it out to you. It has a huge patio which is great for a post workout brunch, meeting up with friends or just coming back yourself for a quick bite. Tip: Don't leave your food unattended on the patio, not for one second, or the birds will be on it!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed an ice cream break at this cafe with some friends and their kids.  Will be back but the ice cream is a bit expensive and not loads of choice. Works."}
{"text":"Cosy cafeteria style restaurant tucked into High Park. As I was overwhelmed by their menu options -- and exhausted from biking straight uphill to get there -- the kindly server suggested a chicken Caesar wrap. Respectable. Seems like a safe choice to break for lunch when you're at the park. Especially since it's the only place. Their patio is very nice as well. Very nice indeed.  Obligatory Title Pun:  Grena-DEAR-y me, what a lovely café.  Menu Readability: Just endless options above the counter.  Need to mention: There is a giant fake maple tree in the middle of the restaurant.  What this place teaches me about myself: Arboreal interiors make me uneasy."}
{"text":"It's a simple, straight-forward place.  I think it is more location specific - the food will not be the element that draws you in.  Patio is lovely.  The food is nothing spectacular - it is inexpensive but reflects the price in quality.  My partner felt sick for a day afterwards & my grilled vegetables were soggy.  I probably wouldn't return unless I needed a cold drink on a patio & was already in the center of High Park."}
{"text":"Went here hungry as as hell after a long bike ride.  Ordered the \"angus\" burger and was severely disappointed.  Maybe it's because of the great burger bars and poutineries popping up around the city that has made me especially sensitive to frozen, cardboard laden patties, and wet napkin tasting poutine.  I guess maybe I'm really just upset because it's such a great spot that I feel they should step up their game.  Oh yeah, the birds really enjoyed the poutine though :)"}
{"text":"This cutesy cafe that's snuggled deep in the 400 acres that make up High Park was bustling when I visited it yesterday. Might I add that it was 1pm on a Tuesday?   Grenadier Cafe is located at the heart of High Park at the junction of West Road, Colborne Lodge Road and Deer Pen Road (where the small year-round zoo is). It's also at the intersection where you'd head off to watch \"A Dream In High Park\" at the amphitheatre in the summer months.   There's a huge (fake) maple tree that spans the entire indoor part of the cafe, which makes you kinda feel like you're still outside. And unlike the former \"cafeteria\" feel, the place has been renovated to now include a full menu, including all-day breakfast and sandwiches. Once you've ordered and paid, you take a number to your table and a server brings your food to you. My dad and I ordered two breakfast specials (I got 3 poached eggs with grilled vegetables and homefries and he got a breakfast sandwich with homefries) and with drinks the total came to about $15. Suuuper cheap.  Gotta agree with Luke that the best part about the cafe is the outdoor patio, which is gargantuan and wraps around most of the restaurant. Because it backs onto West & Colborne Lodge, there's a lot of traffic and it's a great spot to people-watch. There's also an outdoor ice cream hut in the patio area where you can order scoops and Drumsticks, Oreo Ice Cream Sandwiches and the like."}
{"text":"Enjoy Simple Straight-Forward Meals. High Park is a great place to spend some downtime. The Grenadier is a good place to sit down for a quick meal while you're there."}
{"text":"Five stars only for the all day breakfast.   I never ordered anything else. But I doubt you can beat the price.   Ultimate breakfast is a must try just once in your life"}
