{"text":"This place is pretty good. Had the hot veal which was tender and a generous amount of meat. The Greek salad was also well seasoned and very fresh."}
{"text":"Decent food for a decent price. Pizzas don't look too good but the sandwiches do hit the spot. Lots of combinations of pasta, lasagna, linguine, etc. Best analogy is that this like eating in a food court."}
{"text":"Taking over for the short lived Jersey Boyz spot on the southwest corner of Bloor & Islington, is Big Slice Express.  Aside from the name change, it looks pretty much the same inside and even the menu isn't much different. You'll find Salads, Soups, Chicken Wings, Pastas, Panini Sandwiches, and Pizzas on offer.  The big promotion for them seems to be their \"2 for $9.99\" menu. You get to choose between any 2 of the following, which also comes with garlic bread: -Beef Lasagna -Veggie Lasagna -Veal / Chicken / Eggplant Parmigiana -Greek Salad -Italian Salad -Caesar Salad -Penne w/ Napolitano / Alfredo / Rose Sauce -2 Italian Sausages -4 Meatballs -Chicken Cacciatore  It's good they are focusing on a wider cross section of Italian food as the last thing this area needs is more pizza (Pizziola, Pizza Pizza, and Pizza Pastaways are all within a 2 minute walk).  We ordered a few orders of various combos. Admittedly they mixed up the orders (put veal in one order of chicken and vice versa) but overall it was easily salvageable and overall pretty good. One thing I'll say is that the breaded veal was very thin. Unless they are stacking multiple pieces on top of each other, it will be hard pressed to say they are as good as their locations predecessors in the sandwich department.   But knowing the limiting options in this area for food, perhaps they will find a way to survive.  Hopefully it doesn't involve constantly blasting the radio speaker thats hung outside over the front door, blaring low quality sound across the intersection with noise pollution. That things pretty annoying."}
{"text":"I love this place. The owners are super friendly and the pizza is so good. (Throw it in the oven for 30 secs or so if you take it home) Really though I'd recommend the pasta any type. Way better than eating in a sit down Italian restaurant. The owner Joe will make you carbonara if you ask him.  Pick two menu is quick and easy. I often get lasagna and a salad. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Another reviewer nailed it perfectly when he compared the food here to that of a food court. Having said that, there aren't many food options at Bloor and Islington and I'd say they're all pretty much food court material. Sometimes, however, you're in a hurry and you just need inexpensive sustenance.   On a more positive note, the owners are nice and friendly."}
