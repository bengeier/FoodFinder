{"text":"Love their coffee and food! Very friendly staff.  I just wish they had more seating:-("}
{"text":"I can't imagine how Luci's ever got a bad review. We have been there at least 6 times in the past month,at all different times. Each visit the food was fantastic,the staff warm,courteous and attentive. We have eaten everything from omelets,burgers,smoothies (smoothies are 1/2 price after 5pm) and salads and more,all great. I made one suggestion to the manager on duty (Alfred) and he couldn't say enough how they appreciated constructive criticism,and would act on my suggestion..
The overall feel of Luci's is just a very welcoming place.They have jazz on sat evenings,looking forward to trying that soon
I think a lot of the negative reviews are bogus from other competitors
All the best, Mark and Allison W"}
{"text":"I used to love Luci's.  I didn't mind paying a little more than I would at another coffee shop because it was good, the baristas were friendly, and it's on my way to work.

But then...

Within the past month I have started having some seriously crappy experiences.  I am willing to wait for my food, I am in no rush and certainly don't mind relaxing in the sun at the roll-up door for a bit.  But when I have to wait for my coffee for an exceptionally long amount of time only for it to be made wrong, I am annoyed.

I am even more annoyed when someone is in line behind me has their order made before mine because they are friends with the staff.  And then my drink is made incorrectly on top of that.  This has happened multiple times and I think it is incredibly rude!!

I am most annoyed when my significant other is forced to wait 15 minutes for a simple egg sandwich and a bagel, goes to inquire with the staff behind the counter and has to wait for them to finish their gossip before he is addressed.  And his food order had been completely forgotten and must wait even longer now.

There is one barista there that I can handle, he's been there for a long time and knows what he is doing and is efficient and pleasant every time I see him, and that gets them the 2 stars they have from me.  All the other counter staff are awful!  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"I don't live nearby, but I was in the area, had heard about the place, and after seeing how busy it was decided to give it a try for breakfast. I got the \"Burrito Bomb\" to go and ate it right away. It was piping hot and tasted good enough (not great and pricey for what it was). The problem came about an hour later: first I started sweating and became very nauseous; then the intestinal symptoms started. Within the next hour I was racing for the toilet: without getting graphic, first out one end then the other.   About 30 minutes later one more round of violent vomiting: and now, 3 hours later, I'm still a bit nauseous but other than that the illness is over. I have a background in science and food safety; and know the difference between food intoxication (when you get sick about an hour after eating and the illness is short-lived); and food infection (when you get sick, sometimes right after eating, and the symptoms last from several days to a week or more). Food infection, commonly called \"food poisoning,\" comes from bacteria infected food that was eaten appx 3-7 days earlier and has been incubating in your body until you finally get sick. People often mistakenly blame the last thing they ate if the onset is right after eating; but the length of the illness lets you know it is really from something eaten days earlier. Conversely, food intoxication actually is from the last thing you ate, and the brevity of the illness makes that clear: it also is not caused by a bacteria, but rather from mishandled food that has become spoiled (e.g. leaving food with mayonnaise out too long, or using something too far past its expiration date). Based on the time of onset and the duration of my symptoms, I know that what made me sick was the Burrito Bomb from Luci's. Since I'm not in that area often, and paid with cash, asking for a refund doesn't make sense; and the likelihood of Luci's paying attention to what happened to me, and looking at their food handling procedures, seems greater if I make my complaint about getting sick from their food public. So that's it, that's my review from the one, and only, time I will eat at Luci's."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that Luci's has been a great refuge when I needed somewhere to go without a lot of noise (aka children screaming and running around).  Where they fall short is the food.  The menu is inconsistent and seems to change with the moon phase.  Recently I went in to order \"dinner\" only to find out what used to be an actual \"dinner\" menu with awesome comfort foods is now just the \"lunch\" menu extended.

With all of that said... let me tell you the second thing that disappointed me about Luci's.  I ordered the meatloaf sandwich.  I was told it was close to the old \"dinner\" menu meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  I asked for the sandwich with NO BREAD!  Guess what?  Yep, it was brought 20 minutes later to the table with bread!  Guess what?  They fixed it by scraping the meat off the bread and bringing it back!  This is great for a place that prides it self in being \"food allergy friendly\".  I sure hope that the owner sees that this is affecting her business.  I used to recommend this establishment to friends.  I will think twice now before I tell a friend about \"the cool place on the corner\"."}
{"text":"Ok so typically when I come here I get the same thing few things; the Turkey burger, tuna sandwich or salmon sandwich and it's always amazing! Today I ordered the kale salad with chicken but when I received my meal it didn't look like chicken on my plate. What I saw on my plate resembled something like jerky. My chicken breast was so dried out, hard and cold!!!! Like something that had been sitting in the microwave for days. It was disgusting and so disappointing."}
{"text":"One of the only places I can find in my neighborhood with great jalape√±o bagels. Also I will recommend the Greek omelet can't go wrong with that. Fresh casual spot my favorite breakfast spot super friendly staff and in a fun part of town this area is attracting some cool new restaurants and shops."}
{"text":"A cute little store.  Love their product lines...wish they carried organic/sustainable meats in their sandwiches and I also wish that they would get the loud guy working there a muzzle.  He was totally killing the vibe as every time I got a second to collect my thoughts I could hear him yelling something to someone right in front of him as if he just had to make sure everyone in the store heard him.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Last night we went to Luci's Healthy Marketplace/the Coffee bar. Its the cutest little health food store & coffee bar w/ Live music on Saturday nights. Its open till 10 on friday & Saturday, but we didn't get a chance to get in the until 10:30. We sat & talked to the owners until 11ish.They're super sweet people who are believers & their story on how they started to the Grocery/restaurant/coffee bar is an amazing story to hear. I highly recommend you go & check out this place & have some delicious food & yummy coffee. Lucis husband is so real and raw about living healthy and enjoying life. It was refreshing. Don't forget to Say Hi to Luci while your there, she is just as cute as a button."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and a great shop with tons of unique items!

Healthy and tasty are not mutually exclusive, and Luci's delivers quality food! I do not seek out healthy food (and try not to recoil from it), but Luci's was great food, and the healthy aspect was a bonus!"}
{"text":"right down-the-middle cafe. not bad. not good. mediocre.

parking is fairly easy unless YOU HAVE TO be one of the cars immediately in front of the place. plenty of spaces towards the back of the strip mall.

lines move fairly quickly and the staff here is pretty well-trained. i'm moreso calling shenanigans on the quality of food and the soccer mom crowd at Luci's. food is pretty-OK albeit overpriced for what you get. for example the $10 Turkey Lurkey is a turkey w/ bacon sandwich that is 10% turkey, 10% cheese, 30% bread and 50freaking% MIXED GREENS SALAD. small iced coffee? $5, son! over-priced food that is skimpy on portion size.

cute location if you don't have a loud family of 15 sitting in your ear. find the right spot at Luci's and it's downright pleasant. sit next to screaming kids and it's torture. it's like flipping a coin at this place. 50-50 chance you'll have an alright time.

one thing is for certain: it won't be cheap. another thing for certain: at best it'll be \"OK\"."}
{"text":"We stopped in this evening for a grab-n-go meal (bacon and eggplant lasagna, not too bad, I had a taste).  We walked out with $70 worth of grocery items and a Jacuzzi Primitivo wine (don't scoff at the Jacuzzi name, its an old name and a terrific vineyard - we originally tried their wine from igourmet.com's wine club, and it was fantastic!).  

My wife made a comment that this place is probably pronounced Luchi's...I'm not sure, but it may be...quite a lot of italian grocery items and also a good selection of Kosher items.  I'd rate the grocery as similar to Trader Joe's but higher end and much smaller.  It's not cheap, but it's what you'd expect in value for the price.

I really like the coffee bar with the roll up garage door and the old fashioned styling.  This place is a wonderful new addition to the neigborhood, I'd love to go back soon.  Too bad they don't serve wine or have wine tastings....but you can't do it all!

I would never go to Starbuck's across the street with this place open.  They serve nice baked goods from Simply Bread (wish they had Tammie Coe and MJ Bread, but you can't have it all), and some delicious cheesecake they buy from some famous place in Chicago.  Free wi-fi!"}
{"text":"I love luci's :)

The staff is always upbeat and helpful!!!
The food is super fresh!!!
And I love the atmosphere!
One of my top coffee shops in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Big Boy B-fast good, with colorful fried potatoes.  Oatmeal was instant - lame.  Lots of seating.  Nice casual atmosphere.  Lots of unhealthy sweet stuff - for a health market :)  Prices seemed a bit high."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots! Great coffee, amazing breakfast burrito bomb, delicious pastries! You cannot go wrong and will definitely not be disappointed! Lunch is yummy as well. Parking is not the greatest, and it can get quiet crowded at times, but it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner during the week.  Not too busy, cute things to browse while waiting for your food, and delicious!  We'll be back, I'd love to try breakfast here!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Luci's entirely by happenstance. It turned out to be kismet. Love the relaxed atmosphere, delicious food (that is fairly priced) and super service by very nice people. If you are looking for an casual dining experience that is isn't the usual, filled with great company or a place to chill, Luci's won't disappoint. I plan to be a regular."}
{"text":"Coffee is good, not great, better than starbucks, but overpriced by about a buck a drink. 

Sandwiches are nothing to write home about.

Service varies from an over ( too) friendly guy in the morning which would be great if I was caffeinated prior to walking in, to crappy service in the afternoons. 

Get some authenticity and I will be the neighborhood customer you need."}
{"text":"The place is inviting, the concept is cool but it was very disappointing when I asked for a fresh squeezed OJ and they told me it was fresh and gave me a juice out of a bottle. Ok it's squeezed and it's local but it definitely does not taste like fresh oranges ! Then I went back and complained and the uneducated staff argued back to me. They haven't then tasted the OJ at essence bakery! That is true fresh squeezed pulp an all!
ALSO the eggs Benedict were overcooked, still delicious, but overcooked.  Do recommend the French toast."}
{"text":"I face weekend mornings with a fairly simple choice. Do I turn left and go to Starbucks on 32nd and Lincoln or turn right and head to Luci's? Easy choice and Luci's wins every weekend. Starbucks is for caffeine on a work day while Luci's is something else entirely. 

I'm from a very small town (3,500 people). In a small town every place you eat, drink, shop, or otherwise patronize places you alongside people from the community. To me, Luci's basically embodies the same kind of local, community based feeling but in a very large and widespread city. It is a place that has to be discovered because there is a Starbucks across the intersection that provides the uninitiated a safe option that keeps them in their comfort zone. 

The staff are simply great, offering up friendliness along with the coffee and food. They have the best french toast that I've had maybe ever. I'm a frequent flyer on the bagel and lox airline. The only thing I would add there is to please, please, please start slicing the onions thinner for the bagels/lox. 

I've bought some things from the grocery store, but it isn't my usual reason for going. They have unusual items that might be difficult to find elsewhere. I feel like Luci's is a throwback and I mean that in the best possible way. Give Luci's a shot, I think you'll like it."}
{"text":"This is truly one of my favorite spots for breakfast! Please note i always get an omelette so if you dont like omelette, this maybe no good unless you like coffee then you are in for a treat"}
{"text":"Fantastic Latte! Even though it was sugar free (doctors orders) it was delicious! I had Soy latte with sugar free carmel and sugar free dark chocolate mixed  and it was divine!!! Lots of fun stuff to look at and \"healthy\" grocery."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch or to relax with a coffee. Their hot chocolate is amazing."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always good, you can get breakfast anytime. The breakfast burrito is one of my favs. I can't say enough about the owners, managers and staff - they are AWESOME!! Can't wait for their new place to open. Take my word for it - come check this place out!!"}
{"text":"I went to Lucy's this morning, and was so disappointed, that I had to edit my review.  You guys were way understaffed and unable to handle a morning coffee crowd. I ordered a regular coffee and a bagel and it was about 10 minutes before I had it in my hands. The worst part was that when I ordered a bagel, the cashier told me it wasn't fresh enough to serve and subsequently had to find me a fresh bagel by feeling the plastic bags of bagels. . .  Needless to say, I walked away very disappointed and might not come back."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I want to love and adore Luci's. But I can't.  I love the atmosphere, the knick knacks, and the grocery section. I love the windows and open garage doors and patio area. I love their concept. But unfortunately, I haven't loved the food. I am vegetarian,  not vegan, but still pretty strict and my guy is a meat eating, Nebraska man. The there are plenty of choices to satisfy everyone's needs. Vegan, vegetarian, gluten free,  local...but they are hit or miss. On our first visit I ordered a Naughty nurse, and my bf ordered a non memorable sandwich.  We both got potato salad for our sides. And an iced latte. My sandwich was good, I'd eat it again, and I enjoyed the potato salad. .it was light and dill-y,  but slightly bland. My guy's sandwich was ok, but nothing he remembered as being yum. He didn't care for the potato salad at all. The coffee was good and pretty good sized..no complaints there. Today's visit..not so great. I ordered the fresh kale salad..which they should rename \"the dentist special\". The description says kale, tomatoes, almonds, parmesean,  lightly dressed in lemon and olive oil.  The plate looked gorgeous. .so pretty and bright and fresh..the first few bites were nice...and then it started...this salad must have had 2 cups of roughly chopped almonds in it. Every bite was mouthfuls of almonds..i started to dig around. .more almonds..after getting about a quarter of the way through the salad I had to stop eating.  My tooth was zinging from a particularly hard almond and my jaw, was tired from chewing.  I started to dig out the almonds and separating them. ..i had at least a cup and a half of almonds on my plate. My boyfriend tried the salad and said it tasted like \"cardboard easter basket shreds\". Let's move on to his meal..the \"famous natural burger\". It comes on a brioche bun, with tomatoes and a pickle spear on the side, topped with bacon, grilled onions and mushrooms and cheddar cheese.  He ordered it medium rare with a side of fruit (For me). The burger was well done, but still juicy. But a strange thing happened. .it was dry. Like oddly, dry. He squeezed the meat and you could see juice,  but it was like the bun soaked it up and absorbed it. It came without any sauce, so he added mustard, quite a bit, and it was still so dry. The fruit side was pineapple, cantaloupe and honey dew. It was all hacked up and odd, like a child prepared it. But it was fresh, and after the Easter grass nut salad and dry burger, it was refreshing.  The atmosphere is great..like the perfect, busy coffee house cafe. There are students, business people, ladies who lunch, couples, kids, hipsters, hippies, and the occasional metal head couple (us). The staff is great. Always super friendly. They have a large selection of groceries and to-go food. And a wide variety of coffee and tea drinks. Plus all kinds of cool crap for sale..kitschy lip gloss, \"vintage-y\" kids toys, more stuff than I can even remember.  I just wish the food was more reliable. Will we go again..probably.  would I recommend it...to certain people, yes. If they can iron out the kinks, it would be a 5 star place.."}
{"text":"A hip, fun little place, located on the busy cross streets of 16th Street and Bethany Home, Luci's has LOADS of veggie-friendly offerings, much of it leaning toward the healthier side, including gluten-free items. The All Day Breakfast menu items make choosing even more difficult! The staff is friendly and I've loved everything I've sampled so far. My current favorite is the fresh kale salad (of course I have to balance out all of that healthiness by getting a hot coffee and THE BEST dark chocolate sea salt cookie I've had). The market side of this charming corner space offers a good amount of unusual, quirky gift items in addition to groceries. The only problem I've ever had is with parking - sometimes it's a pain to find an open space here due to so many neat little shops being crammed into this corner... but this place is worth it!"}
{"text":"Drove buy a couple of times and actually saw it on TV today. Went in to check it out.  Its vary small but has a good variety for its size but doesn't seem to cater towards one thing. I guess it can be looked at as a convenience vs travel all the way to sprouts, trader Joe or whole foods.  The prices are on the high side for their frozen foods and the prepared meals. Tuna Salad with some lettuce was like $8.00. I saw other salads like this for over $7.00. The only realistic deal seemed to be a meatloaf sandwich at $6.00. The juices and other beverages were also over priced much like whole foods. I don't understand how a brand new health store can open during this time and charge the same amounts as Whole foods when trader Joe has a greater variety and way cheaper prices. IMO, I think the extra 2 mile drive is worth it due to the small selection and high prices. Maybe they did the demographics and the neighborhood poeple don't mind spending the extra buck. I just don't see any benefits. Seems to me like they are trying to do alittle of everything and not concentrating on something to make them unique."}
{"text":"Great coffee, great meeting spot.  

I generally go for the coffee, but everything is great.  I'm not usually a fan of iced tea but they gave me one sample and now I'm hooked. They also have black--haven't tried that; what i'm talking about is a mixture of pomegranate and a bunch of other stuff--it's orange in color; don't remember what all is in it but I get it if I'm not getting coffee.  

Service is great; if a new employee messes up, the managers will bend over backwards to make sure you leave more than happy--with nobody making a fuss."}
{"text":"Such a great additional the neighborhood!! I visited Luci's right after they opened and they were still filling the shelves and getting things organized but I could tell that I am going to like this place. I bought a few things from their bakery counter and they were great. There is a large selection of health food and health related items. I look forward to visiting Luci's more and getting a better feel for the store and hopefully becoming a regular!!"}
{"text":"I have driven many miles to this lovely little oasis - their coffee is the best in the city. 

They have many gluten free dining options and their staff is delightful.  I with there was a Luci's in every major Phoenix neighborhood.  Their food and coffee is without parallel."}
{"text":"I love Luci's - I went last week and have been going ever since - it's fantastic. The decor is fun and inviting, everything is clean and easy to find. The coffee is TO DIE FOR - I love it. 

Read my full review here: www.thehotsheetblog.com"}
{"text":"Cutest little Neighborhood grocery store! We love walking here in the morning for breakfast. They always have the cutest things on their shelves and the staff is always super friendly."}
{"text":"I rate Luci's highly for a remarkable staff, excellent coffee drinks, and for its very local feel.  Like John K says, this coffee shop has a small-town feel, and if you want to make new friends in the neighborhood, try out Luci's.

The groceries are a bit overpriced in my opinion, but I suppose that comes with being a small retailer..."}
{"text":"My favorite cafe in the valley. This place is conveniently located in central phoenix. It makes for a quick trip stop for a healthy option or a great place to get cozy for a few hours."}
{"text":"Cool addition to the neighborhood, which nearly influenced me to pop for 4 stars, but they will have to continue to prove themselves before I go that far. I tried describing Luci's to a friend and came up with \"sort of mini-Trader Joe's, health food but not really, some gourmet stuff, little bit of produce, organic soaps and vitamins, meals-to-go coffee bar.\" My friend's response was \"Sounds like an identity problem\". 

I'm not really sure what is going to shine at Luci's...the coffee bar service has been mediocre (another customer and I had to sort out our drink orders when she was given both of ours and I was served nothing) and the coffee content in the soy latte is disturbingly low. The one grab-n-go item I tried (eggplant lasagna) was nice but not outstanding. The baked goods are tasty but I'm trying to limit intake of those. The selection of gourmet imported items (particularly Italian) is small but high quality, and same for the produce. Will there be enough of anything to make me a regular? Hard to say... 

The atmosphere is one area of excellence - I love the retro/modern decor, the openness of the place and the little details like the glass tile accents. Unfortunately the seating area fills up quickly and I haven't been able to get a seat yet. Unless you are there very early or off peak hours, don't count on eating in.  If they ever expand their breakfast menu beyond bakery items, they will really need to think about how to accommodate more seating."}
{"text":"I love going to Luci's to sit back and relax with some friends, or take my laptop to browse the internet all while sipping on a Green Tea Smoothie (with a banana mixed into the drink).  They have a good menu, and delicious pastries!  I'd have to say The Hum-Dinger Vegan Wrap and Say Cheese melt are so far my favorites.  I especially enjoy going to Luci's because the place has a good down-to-earth atmosphere, and their staff is friendly.  They also have on Sundays a a musician come in to sing and strum a few melodies on the guitar, which is nice to hear just before the hustle-&-bustle work week begins.  Overall, Luci's has a good vibe all around, the owners are very pleasant people, and it's a local business that I'm proud to support!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and helpful service.  I can definitely see myself stopping in for a relaxing Saturday morning coffee and newspaper or to get specialty items for a nice meal.  It reminded me a lot of La Grand Orange.  I look forward to returning sometime soon. :)"}
{"text":"Luci's was such a pleasant surprise. My first stop there was last week. The occasion was to meet to others for a quick business introduction. Initially, I was worried about seating--because it's not as if Luci's provides an assortment of private tables from which to choose. We wound up wedged into a corner table, but that's part of the charm--the closeness that makes it feel like a neighborhood spot. 

The highlight was getting my soy latte in a heavy corrugated cup with their classic retro styling. it was beautiful. No one has ever offered me up a soy latte with a design on top in all my years of ordering them. The banter with warm and sincere coffee bar staff was a really fun start to the day and made me wish I lived in the neighborhood so I could make it a part of my day. The spinach quiche was a slight cut above Paradise Bakery's. And it was nice to have the option to order a warm egg item from a coffee shop menu.

The seating probably doesn't lend itself to working meetings, but the rest of the environment is the perfect place to connect with friends at a true neighborhood grocery and coffee spot."}
{"text":"Luci's has excellent healthy food.  I ordered a build your own omelet and it was delicious.  I really enjoyed the breakfast potato' and fresh fruit. Great laid back atmosphere.  I am making a point to eat at Luci's at least once a week."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Luci's since they opened and I LOVE this place!  Always greeted with a smile and they go out of their way to help you find what you need or suggest something delicious.  BTW - Everything is delicious.  Whenever I ask my daughter where we should grab lunch, she says LUCI's!  The coffee is great and I love that they have almond milk as an option (Starbucks can't compete) and the vegan cheese in an omelet is so yum!  I recently had an order that wasn't quite right, got back to work before I noticed.  Sent an email and they kindly offered to pay for my lunch the next time.  They care about their customers!"}
{"text":"Had lunch a few weeks ago with my mom and it was delicious. We had their burger (cooked perfectly and great quality) and split a salad.  We also tried their green tea smoothie and it was awesome. i wish Luci's was close so that I could visit more often!!!"}
{"text":"This place is of my favorite restaurants. Love the green tea and the atmosphere. They also have cute things and wine to buy. They also have a lot of healthy options which is nice."}
{"text":"So I grew up in this 'hood and moved to Seattle 10 years ago.  I still visit Phoenix as often as possible (I can't help it, I love it more all the time) and I want to see the whole area around 16th street and Bethany get better as it ages. Living in Seattle, we all think we know coffee, wine, micro beer, healthy food, etc. So I entered Luci's with my NW snobbery firmly in place developed by 10 years of rain soaked passive-aggressive existential angst. Long story kind of short, the place is really cool, great coffee, friendly people working it, strong food, good grocery selection, etc. I went back 3 times in 4 days, I will definitely be back again. Sure you feel like the cars on 16th are sitting at the table with you, so what. It's a great addition to the 'hood. Now if they can just do something nice with that old deserted Bashas property."}
{"text":"Cute retro market with local/healthy/organic products and a coffee bar. Fans, bar counter and bathrooms all have fun design details. There's also a demo area where takeaway meals are prepared (this wasn't totally up and running when I stopped in mid-April).

This place is starting out, with a soft opening just 3 weeks before I saw it. In the next month there should be some grand opening activities."}
{"text":"I haven't actually been inside Luci's, but we had lunch brought in to our office from here so I have had the food.  To start with, I wasn't very impressed by the menu, it was really small, and not very exciting to say the least.  I ended up just getting the tomato soup because it was a cold day and I figured it would warm me up.  Well the soup started out good, it was like a creamy tomato, but after a few more bites I just couldn't handle it anymore....there was way too much pepper....it made it almost inedible!  If they had backed off on the pepper it would have been good, but it was too overwhelming.

Also, they messed up quite a few of our orders, making for some unhappy people.  I think we all decided that we wouldn't be ordering from them again, and I will probably never see the inside because of our experience."}
{"text":"My mom & I were looking for a healthy place to have lunch yesterday, so I did a search for healthy spots near my work & Luci's was the 1st place to come up. Finding a parking spot was kind of hard, we drove around twice & then finally someone was backing out so we scored a spot. We made our way over to the cafe side & looked over the menu. I got the strawberry patch salad (added chicken) & my mom got the veggie head salad. For drinks I got the pomegranate citrus iced tea & my mom, who always asks if places carry diet sprite/7up (they NEVER do), settled for a stevia sweetened lemon-lime soda. I LOVED my salad, although I wish the chicken was grilled, my mom said hers was pretty good. I really liked my iced tea, so refreshing! My mom said  she didn't like her soda, but she drank it all so it probably wasn't that bad. Total for our salads & drinks was about $25. Seems a lil pricey to me, which initially was the reason I wanted to give Luci's 3 stars, but that open garage is just way too cool, so 4 stars it is. If I wasn't trying to be healthy that day I so would have sampled some of the yummy looking desserts, they all looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend Veronica happened to stumble upon this darling marketplace and cafe while shopping around Phoenix today!  I'm always excited to find a grocery store that carries an array of health-conscious items!  We discovered that Luci's had many gluten-free/organic options that I normally can't find anywhere else!  Loved all the openness in the cafe area, the entire atmosphere was very warm and inviting.  I could definitely sit there a few hours and get all cozy with a warm 'cup of joe' and my laptop.  Also liked that the cafe contained stevia sweetener packets and agave nectar--that's a really awesome and rare find!  The barista made me feel extra special when he asked if I wanted some of their homemade whipped cream!!!  I couldn't refuse when he explained it was made from agave nectar, vanilla bean, and espresso--and I must say it was totally YUM!  V kept dipping her stir stick in my doppio for more!  

Veronica made a good point today when she expressed how neat it is that more and more people are leaning towards a better way of eating--I couldn't help but agree!  And great to have a store like Luci's to inspire a healthier lifestyle!"}
{"text":"I use to love this place until today. I ordered an acai bowl because it's the only thing on the menu I can eat now with my food allergies. I paid $11.85 for this and it hardly has any fruit. I could not believe what a rip off this was."}
{"text":"This place is terrific.  Good food to eat in a simple, crowded but friendly area, good selection of health food and other nice things, wonderfully friendly staff and very hip all-age clientele. Why would anyone go to the Starbucks kitty-corner? This place is like home."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating here. It's a great place to meet friends for coffee, breakfast or lunch. The prices are a little higher than average; however, the food and drink is surely worth it. I always get a Chai Frappuccino and an order of pancakes. The staff is always friendly and the service always quick. There is also plenty of browsing to do while waiting for your order. Luci's isn't just a place to eat; I often stop in to grab a few items for dinner on nights when traveling all the way to the grocery store is not an option.  I highly recommend Luci's to anyone looking for a good place to eat or find some coffee."}
{"text":"Very popular place. The staff are friendly and polite and eager to help. I enjoy their selection of kombucha and healthy snacks. Their selection of spices is good. 

The place is crowded and busy. Kind of like a Cracker Barrel, with everything mashed together. Here they offer assorted foods next to sundries and doodads. 

The parking sucks but it's very convenient if you visit during non-busy hours to run in and grab some good food."}
{"text":"This was my first and last trip to Luci's HEALTHY Marketplace. I ordered the low carb turkey wrap. If you are expecting actual, real turkey you will be disappointed to know it is just lunch meat. More processed, unhealthy food. I then ask for two pieces of lean bacon. It came out burned. I sent it back and the bacon was the same. I was told by the server that the cook assumed that lean and extremely crisp were one in the same. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Such a fun atmosphere! The frozen hot chocolate was delicious. I like how the coffee bar area is seperate from the sandwich/lunch area, I think that makes traffic easier. The eating area is delightful too because they the tables set up with napkins and silverware already. Their Foursquare special is great too! $5 off $30 grocery purchase."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. They have excellent gluten free options. I always get the cafe caramel, which is so good. Keep it up Ms. Luci. Or is it Miss Luci?"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place... Quiet, but busy and always friendly staff. Have been coming here for about 6 years... Food is good too, but mostly come for the coffee and Wifi. Great location on the corner of Beth any Home & 16th Street. Open and airy also... So unlike the stuffy Starbucks, etc... Give it a try and u'll be hooked also."}
{"text":"I'm an espresso snob. I can tell immediately if my shots were pulled incorrectly or the portafilters need to be cleaned.  That being said, thank you Luci for my perfect iced sf vanilla latte. It was perfect."}
{"text":"After a good morning workout I like to reward myself with a nonfat latte instead of my regular home brew, so I stopped by Luci's on my way back from Dreamy Draw. I have to echo Laura E. - I'm in love! The big garage door was wide open and I ordered my coffee in the gorgeous morning sunshine (which probably doesn't help my already bad case of spring fever) while the adorable barista boys chatted with me about my St. Patty's Day. 

The best part was looking across the street at the Starbucks crammed with 30 cars in the drive-thru and knowing that my morning was likely to be more lovely and peaceful at Luci's. 

I love Luci's for their nice ambiance, unique products, warm and welcoming service and because it's a perfect location for where I live and work. 

One final note - they sell Full Sail Session Lager from my home state of Oregon that I absolutely love. I'll be back soon for lunch, and hopefully my four stars will become five!"}
{"text":"I like this place. The coffees are good and the food is tasty.  Probably the food isn't as good as the ambiance of the place, it just a has a real cool vibe to it so who cares?

Parking is usually a problem but the staff is very warm and friendly."}
{"text":"I went to Luci's for the first time in 2011 and found the staff to very friendly and helpful.  I only visited the eatery and not the store but I was impressed with the service and knowledge they had about the products they offered."}
{"text":"Cute decor is great and all but otherwise this place is not quite making the grade. The service was slow and my bagel was horrendous. It seems like these days places think they can get by on good looks alone. Good food and good service are still tops in my book."}
{"text":"Luci's is very much in the swing of things. A coworker noted once noted to me that during the first months of operation they had been hit or miss. But my recent experiences have been great. I love getting an Americano, relaxing with a magazine and then picking up a few items for dinner before leaving. 
Great one-stop place. I'm so glad we have a little market like this on the north edge of Phoenix, I think it fulfilled a gap. It's like a slice of downtown living for us Squaw Peak dwellers."}
{"text":"Good gluten free options and cute spot, but a tad overpriced. I spent $18 on an iced coffee, bagel sandwich, and tiny bag of tortilla chips. I also felt that it was a bit crowded. However, the service was good and they carried lots of great products."}
{"text":"What a great find! We had just touched down in Phoenix and we're on our way to the Grand Canyon through Sedona. Luci's popped up as a healthy option. We had three people in our party that had food allergies and one person who is a vegan, So this place fit the bill.

Everyone raved about the food, I had the same feelings about my blackened salmon sandwich which came with a nice sized piece of salmon, incredible sauce, and beautiful vegetables. A number of us had smoothies as well, the chai smoothie that I had was amazing. 

I would highly recommend Luci's for anyone seeking healthier options, or just sandwiches that sounds completely delicious. Everyone in our party was very happy and the service was knowledgeable and helpful."}
{"text":"Great space, location, offerings, and feel.  I stopped in to meet a friend and to see the place and really liked what I seen.  Beautifully decorated, great concept  with diverse product mix.  It's all good.  

They are working with local businesses to sell local products as well which is nice to see.  I did try the Tortilla soup and thought it was very tasty and if I wasn't in such a hurry and it was a different time of day, I would have had something more to eat than that as the placed smelt soo good.  

Love the location and that area needed something like this.  Like the open air feeling of it combined with the general look.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Love this place! great salads on the menu, fresh! Great coffee as well.. nice little study digs."}
{"text":"I love this place! Up until recently whole foods was the only place you could buy Daiya vegan cheese, or at least that is what I thought. Luci's not only carries Daiya, but a huge variety of vegan products. While the coffee is not the best (I get the impression the barristas are not that well trained), they do have coconut milk behind the counter and toffutti cream cheese for bagels as well (it is not advertised but it is there). 

The place is adorable as well and the staff is all very nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"Luci's is a special place  with many great qualities:  a fun, friendly staff, great location plus a creative swath of products in their Marketplace, from quick, healthy snacks to clever gift ideas, & much in between. It's a popular spot. I find the coffee disappointing, but I'm no expert, so others may disagree. My complaint is that air conditioning either doesn't work effectively for the space or simply is not set to a comfortable level. This has been a problem since Luci's opened. My friends & I often wind up leaving sooner than we'd like because place is just too hot. In summer, I'm hesitant to meet people there because I know how uncomfortable it will be. It's a shame & I can't help but wonder what the problem is. Luci's is unique & deserving of more stars, please...fix the a/c!!"}
{"text":"Place is super cute. Drove past this and had to stop. So cute and great coffee. Totally coming back and bringing people."}
{"text":"Yum! Stopped here for dinner after a long road trip (read: salty and sweet snacks all day long). I was overwhelmed with healthy, tasty-sounding choices. A server greeted us and explained their options and specialties, and how they serve amazing sounding breakfast all day long. I'm definitely coming back for that salmon and crab omelette, but today I settled on the spring beet salad. It was fresh and delicious--exactly what I was looking for. 

Their market is cute as well, though it's tough to justify the price tag on a lot of their items.  

Their dessert case looked amazing and there were a bunch of coffee choices! For such a small place you have a ton of options."}
{"text":"I live nearby and had always meant to check it out. Now that I finally got in there I will definitely be a repeat. The staff is fantastic, the food excellent. Yes it is a little \"pricey\" but you definitely \"get what you pay for\" .I actually ordered again before I left so I was able to bring home some additional. The containers and bag were unique. All around a very positive experience. Will definitely do it again soon. Sooo many good restaraunts in Phx Phoenix, az arizona"}
{"text":"First time there. I had their coffee latte there it was good but very over priced for the size if the cup. I enjoy tasting different coffee that are not from chains. If you don't mind the price I suggest you definitely want to visit this place. I glanced at the menu but didn't eat as it was pricey. Staff was friendly and answered all my questions. Place is on a corner, there is parking in front or around the corner. Overall nice place if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Luci's for a wine tasting last night. It's not your typical store. It's better! And it looks like it's drawing a lot of regulars from the neighborhood who like to hang out in the coffee bar, chatting and people watching. 

The emphasis is on healthy, local and eco-friendly food and products. They introduced me to Marilyn's tortilla chips and Simply Bread's cranberry walnut bread - big fan of both!!! Of course they have some fantastic gourmet items like my favorite cahill porter cheese and other indulgences as well. 

There is a \"community wall\" where you can post your fliers for car washes, walkathons, workshops, garage sales, etc. They've been open for about two months and the wall looks like it's getting some good use.

My friend created the logo, signage and color palette for the store. I love his work and how it all comes together to make this a very welcoming neighborhood market. Now I just wish is was in MY neighborhood."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!!! Asked the server to watch our party eaten meal so I could talk a child to the bathroom and he agreed. Came back to the table in just a few minutes and all was gone including the child's toys. There was now new patrons sitting at the table. When I approached the server his response was to say I'll get the manager (never once stating he was sorry or explaining what happened). 

After a few minutes the manager came over and gave me the child's toys and said she was sorry. She advised she had refunded the entire meal back to my credit card and handed what looked like a business card. I left the restaurant at that point and drove away. 

As I was driving I went to look at the business card she gave me and found a gift card for $13, my meal was $22. I also realized this was her version of a refund..... 

I return to the restaurant and contacted her again and ask what the $13 was for and she advised is was my refund... I explained my meal was $22 and asked how she decided on $13 (she then tried to explain but in the end what came out was she guessed based on what the server said I had on the table). I explained what I had paid and showed her the charge in my credit card (on my mobile phone app). She then went to try to give me another gift card and I had to push to get the refund. In the end I received a full refund. 

I wish the experience had been better. What food I had a chance to eat seemed good. Too bad... I won't Ever Go Back!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite local coffee shop. I try to keep the local movement in mind when I spend my money, I really do. The coffee is good and Bryant remembers my name and my drink. They offer gluten free options which is always a plus with me. The have a little gf chocolate flourless cupcake which is excellent. I guess my only complaint is that it's everyone else's favorite too! LOL! It's frequently packed and the parking stinks. It's tough to get in and out quickly for just a coffee. They tend to get backed up in the kitchen too when it comes to food. We've waiting a long time for food eating in and for take out. BUT, I still love their coffee and their message and what they offer overall."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick drink, ended up getting a Cafe Caramel and a slice of Classic Cheesecake. They go up to a 32oz for their iced drinks which is great. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"The place is bright and cute (too cute in my opinion), the staff is friendly, and the wifi is free.  Unfortunately, the espresso drinks are horrendous.  

I gave this place two tries separated by a couple of months, with different baristas and the same unfortunate conclusion.  My lattes tasted the way I imagine wet cardboard tastes.  Had to be tossed.  Sorry Luci's, I tried.  

Too yupstery anyway."}
{"text":"One of my girlfriends recommended this place to me and I am in love!
I just moved into the area from Montana for my new job so I was clueless about the places around here. 

The place is confusing at first with SO much to look at. I didn't really know what I was doing, so I ended up following where everyone else was going and alas! I see a menu and a counter.

I was approached by a lovely girl name leigha (?) She was very sweet and welcoming with a beautiful smile. A couple jokes were cracked by her which got the short line behind me laughing. I honestly haven't seen customer service like this in awhile. She helped me out with the ordering and what to do because again, I was just so clueless. She was just all around wonderful! 

I ordered the french toast with some fruit on top because it was very much recommended. I also got a my usual honey almond milk latte ( I get it at every coffee shop I come across). The barista did a great job. I'm bummed I didn't grab her name! But err, she was tall with dark hair and glasses. She did great.

I went in on a Sunday so it was very busy.
Anyway, this place is absolutely wonderful and will definitely be bringing my family here next week when they visit me from back home in Montana!"}
{"text":"Breakfast at Luci's. I don't know how it could get better than a simple toasted everything bagel with butter, lemonade and the LuLulemon fashion show."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and each time I am amazed at how wonderful the food is.  The ambiance is great- the tables and chairs are right at the front in a community type setting. You can also pick up groceries while you're there!"}
{"text":"What a delightful experience! We sat at the omelette bar and enjoyed conversation with the folks making it happen in the kitchen. Late breakfast included a Moe omelette and Egg Sammie. Admittedly, we're frequent LGOers and Luci's tops their breakfast for sure. Will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have tried Luci's many times. Like dozens, because we live close by and it would be so cool to have this place be good. If you like good coffee skip it. A couple of time they sold us regular coffees and were actually out and we had to wait for them to brew more. One time we tried the baked goods and they tasted like they were sitting in that case for weeks! So nasty. Most recently we tried the breakfast we tried the buckwheat pancakes and were charged a dollar for 4 extra blueberries. I tried a cappuccino and the foam was so thick I had to scope it out into the garbage can. The first 4 times we went the staff was rude, un-attentive and very unorganized. The staff seemed to be nicer this time but still unorganized. 

In the end, too expensive for such a sub par experience. Too bad so sad."}
{"text":"Went with the family for the first time to Luci's.  Had been looking forward to it for quite some time.  Loved the atmosphere!  We were able to get a table easily, even with it being Sunday breakfast.  The staff was quick and efficient and very cheery.  My kids had the pancakes and French toast which we all enjoyed!  husband had the huevos rancheros which he liked.  I had the breakfast Sammie which was good.  The quality of the meats was excellent - my sandwich had turkey sausage and we ordered a side of bacon.  My favorites were the kids' dishes and our coffees.  The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 was the cost.  Holy moly!  For what we ordered, we paid $65 plus tip!  When I looked at the bill, it was because everything added up - the cashier kept asking if we wanted to add berries and bananas to our kids' meals and it turns out that each different fruit was $1.  Excessive if you ask me.  I would think adding on fruit would be just one price or she would at least warn me that we would be spending an extra $3 for blueberries, strawberries and bananas.  For the cost of the meals, you would think they came with fruit anyway!  
Overall we enjoyed the food and experience.  I feel like it's rare to get great service in this city sometimes and I don't think that's a problem here.  The staff is great!  We'll be back, especially to bring out-of-town guests who are vegan and gluten intolerant, but we'll just able a little more choosy with our add-ons."}
{"text":"French toast is amazing... it tastes like it's made out of Cinnabons. Om.

Haven't tried anything else aside from a bite of a friends breakfast burrito (didn't do that much for me).  My egg nog latte wasn't actually made with eggnog, but had a shot of syrup so the taste was a bit off.  But the French Toast!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously the best! Food is delicious  staff  are always sweet and friendly. I have not one thing bad to say . I recommend it you must go an check it out !"}
{"text":"While I do appreciate the selection of gluten free items, almost $12 for just a simple lox & bagel is a bit much, yes, that's all I got. And the cashier girl was less than friendly. Parking is bad. The place was packed w people & items so made me a bit nerve wracked & confused. I gave 3 stars because they r local and offer gluten free so that's deserving of something."}
{"text":"I love the coffee and most of the food.  NOTE: THis is a yuppy-priced establishment.
They have a great selection of bottled drinks (kombucha, tea, juice, etc.) and their coffee and coffee related drinks are solid.  

The food they make has never failed to please, plus, as a health food market, you can get gluten-free and other allergy-conscious foods. 

They also have funny if expensive trinkets (gum, magnets, small brash gifts).

As far as the MARKETPLACE goes, I'm not sure why anyone would pay their high prices when even run of the mill grocers now carry most of L's has at half the price.  That said, if you need a biodiesel transported, ovo-disoriented, spiritually wrinkle-free buckwheat pancake mix for $17.99.... well this is your place!"}
{"text":"Luci's is a fun store with good munchies and very friendly and upbeat staff. The people working here certainly make the experience exceptional."}
{"text":"Ordered an a√ßa√≠ bowl- first loss of Star was the fact it was 13 bucks once you add peanut butter- second I'm waiting for 15 min and I finally I ask where I can pick up my item because it was \"Togo\" and the guys that answered (redhead near the kitchen) was super rude and was like just sit down and we'll bring it to you when it's ready- as if I had been the most annoying person asking where to pick up food on my first visit... minus another star.. ok so now my \"A√ßa√≠ bowl\" come is in cup... great... if I wanted a 13 dollar smoothing I could have gotten something else.... consistency of soup... like foamy fluffed liquid ... loss of one more star.. won't come back... ever."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the area and were happy to find such a unique little market, but after going there several times in the last 4 months I'm a little underwhelmed.  They could easily be a 4-5 in my book if they made some changes, but at the current state they are fairly a 3. The atmosphere I love, colors, theme and overall look but they are lacking in consistency and very limited vegan options (zero for breakfast that I could tell).  The best part about this place is the soy coconut lattes which are to die for (if you happen to get a good one).....the problem is you've got about a 50/50 chance of that actually happening.  Sometimes they suck altogether.  The service is also very inconsistent....there always seems to be one super friendly hard working person and then someone that is just standing around sucking up air and not helping the other person even when there is a line 10 back.  I always end up feeling bad for the poor guy stuck doing all the work and over tip for a shitty $5 cup of coffee because they are too busy to put together a decent latte.

Also, they offer vegetarian and vegan cooking classes but very few vegan options on the menu? They do have a decent selection of frozen and dry vegan options that you can buy but 30% higher than other places which I understand is because they don't have the buying power other places do but sorry I'm not going to be doing much shopping there.

I will continue going back because I don't know another place that has coconut lattes and am hoping that some day I'll walk in and see some more vegan options."}
{"text":"When I moved to Arizona I became lactose intolerant. Luci's offers Stauss bottled milk in a jar that you have to pay a deposit for (you get your money back if you bring the bottle back.) You get to scoop the cream off the top and enjoy. I like to enjoy the entire bottle in one sitting, because it is the only milk I have been able to drink with out severe tummy trouble. Luci herself is often at the store when we visit and is one of the sweetest women I have met in my life. One time our order got messed up and she gave us free dessert and drink coupons. I used those drink coupons to discover their Green Tea smoothie thing (with soy) DELICIOUS! Since it's become a busier hot spot, you may have to wait a while before ordering your coffee or food, but it has never disappointed and is a great investment of your time. Oh, and FREE Wi-Fi. Eat your heart out Starbucks across the street."}
{"text":"Coffee shop, cafe, healthy groceries, gifts - it was a one-stop shop for me when I was in Phoenix for a conference. Fast and reliable wifi, friendly employees, and good coffee. Can't go wrong!

I especially like their assortment of gluten-free snacks and fun socks. Those things don't really seem to go together, do they? Well, they do in this case. I definitely browsed their snacks while giving their sock collection the side-eye. 

A bit pricey but on par with what I'm used to in Milwaukee. Will go back if I have time during the rest of my trip."}
{"text":"It's been forever since I had a bagel and lox because it's difficult to find gluten free bagel options, but Luci's not only had the option but it was delicious!

The food/coffee was on point, the staff was friendly, and the atmosphere was fun! It's a little on the pricey side but I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We went to have breakfast for dinner on Saturday Night but they stop serving Breakfast at 5pm, Only on Saturday. The sandwiches we choose instead were meh, but the chicken soup was tasty. The pastries look divine so we got some to go at 50% off. They do have a great selection of Mrs. Meyer's cleaning products, the best I've ever seen. Plus they have a good selection of Vegan and Gluten Free products! We will be back but probably not for a meal."}
{"text":"I want to love it here. I've never had the French toast which seems to be popular, but I've had many things in the menu. It's overpriced for what it is but that can sometimes be the fate of local restaurants. However, it's expensive - annoyingly so. My kale salad was $11.99 - along with tea and a side of tots my lunch was $20.56. Bit expensive for a non- restaurant coffee shop... ? Unless there is an identity crises. I like the local items such as the wine and health food, but again I seldom purchase because it's too much. And, I ALWAYS buy local - this place is more than reasonable.
Other than that - it's fine. Good food, not always so flavorful ( my kale salad was lovely but the chicken was hard and there was no dressing - not even a light oil or a lemon juice something...). Teas are very good and coffee is fine. 
I eat out often and would come here more if food was less for what it is...and I do love the open doors. Parking is a problem ( but not today!!yay) and wifi is good."}
{"text":"I live in this neighborhood and always have an extremely positive experience at Luci's...from the food to their customer service. Luci's led the revitalization of the corner of 16th Street and Bethany Home and the neighborhood is extremely thankful. I had an out of town visitor for 2 weeks and she was hooked on Luci's from day one. Where else close by can you get a vegan sandwich with Vegenaise on gluten-free bread with a side of roasted heirloom potatoes???
 
Thank you Luci!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for brunch. I built my own veggie omelette with spinach, peppers, tomatoes and mushrooms. I have to say, the presentation of the meal was terrific. The omelette came with red and purple potatoes in a mini-skillet. Unfortunately, the taste wasn't up to par. Perhaps they forgot to season the omelette? I'm not sure.. but it was just.. bland. I REALLY wanted to like them, so I will probably come back and try something else. I like the idea of a healthy market & cafe combo, but they need to work on incorporating some spices."}
{"text":"The cool atmosphere is what brought me in the first time, but their warm and caring staff coupled with great food made me a return customer! You can literally find any kind of fun gift for all ages here too! LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"The teas and coffees are top notch - the food sometimes it's not on par and can almost taste like part of the Ingredients have essence of refrigerator- we keep going back so there is something to be said about that- the breakfast sandwich is good and the burrito bomb is pretty good too - I think it boils down to different staff cooking. I have to add that after multiple trips I will now be limiting my visits to beverages only as they can't seem to get the food out while still hot let alone warm. Kinda makes me sad since it's a neat place."}
{"text":"This place is pretty adorable. It's like a less crowded, slightly smaller version of LGO. A smaller wine collection, but you can find what you need. You can also get glass bottles of milk here if you're missing the good ol' days of milkmen (or you were born too late and feel like you missed out). Definitely a place to check out if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I recently moved closer to this area and have been wanting to give Luci's a try.  As soon as I walked in I was greeted by two super friendly barista's, Bryant and Emily. Being my first time here, they were both really awesome helping me pick out what I wanted to eat and drink. This place is really cute and has a lot of awesome food and beverage options. I ordered the Naughty Nurse and an iced latte with almond milk! (really awesome that they offer almond milk...so tired of soy) . It's a nice mix of coffee shop and grocer.  They offer a lot of healthier options, organic/gluten-free/vegetarian and so on.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food and coffee....lots of fun stuff to look at. Love the atmosphere. The Spaniard omelette is the bomb."}
{"text":"The past two times I've been here I've been served cold, soggy tater tots.  Today my Zeus turkey burger was extremely salty, which did not make it very tasty (and I usually like very salty food, but this was obviously over-seasoned ).  

I like that they offer a decent selection of food for decent prices, but when Sonic out-performs you on food quality (note: different from ingredient quality), something is going wrong in the kitchen.

Stats for pleasant counter service and carrying Urban Cookies baked goods."}
{"text":"This review is solely for the coffee part of the market, and the wonderful faces behind the coffee bar! The gorgeous young lady and exceptionally kind and attentive gentleman barista make it a pleasure to brave the difficult parking for my morning spro. My latte is perfect every time. Perfect temp, perfect balance, and perfect service. Every. Single. Time.  I love this place."}
{"text":"This place is unique and awesome. I'd give 5 stars but parking is horrible. You wont regret going here!!"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time. The place is great. Burrito bomb is Awesome! The owner and staff are great and really get to know you. Great local spot in north PHX!"}
{"text":"Located on old N. Central Phoenix, this is my new favorite place. The yellow-fruit smoothie was to die for and lox & bagels were terrific. Absolutely perfect for the early Sunday afternoon pre-nap light bite. So many unique and healthy food items here. Also lots fun novelty items. A great discovery because Lisa and I like to put funny gifts in each other's stocking at Christmas time. Clearly a health/minded, progressive crowd. Can't wait for my next visit! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Love their chocolate protein shake! This is a perfect local healthy market in PHX that I will definitely be paying several visits to."}
{"text":"Used to go here quite often. It was a great place to meet up and have a drink. And a bakery item I love the fact that it's got every thing you need rite there. Full menu of food that's made fresh . All the bakery items and food are made  fresh  rite there on the premisis. Also theirs the grocery store rite there with a good assortment of produce and any thing eles you might need. Many afternoons myself and a dear friend would get our coffee and some thing to eat and read British news papers. 
We would spend some times 2 to 3 hours drinking coffee and reading the various London and UK news papers. We both enjoyed the English as it tends to be significantly different from American English. My friend was not able to read the papers on his own because he had retinitis pigmentosa. Which is a degenerative eye disease that he was born with. Luci's was a really nice place to sit and enjoy a good chat and drink. On many occasions other friends of ours would turn up and join us. And at times we would cross the street and go to Starbucks. If Luci's  was packed with people. Luci'shas tables outside that are covered with awwnings or you can sit inside and if the weather is pleasant which it is from septemper to April they will have the sliding doors all open; so your seated inside but you have the light of day and fresh air. It's really nice. This place gets busy especially on the weekend. They have a great selection of house made drinks and a whole assortment of   popular healthy  beverages as well as snacks they also carry wine and champagne. Another thing I love about Luci's they are health directed I mean they sell and carry organic ( not exclusively) and brands geared towards good health and the other great thing is they have a full kitchen and bakery. They do not have to have the bakery items brought in from a big off site bakery. So if the run out of say a cinnamon roll or a muffin you happen to like;  theirs a good chance that they have more just being freshly baked. Comfortable, welcoming atmosphere. Couples,  singles small groups. It's a really nice place for everyone. They've got 2 Loos. No need to stay at home feeling lonely and blue. Head on out to Luci\"s and have a healthy beverages and enjoy the company of lots of other folks. 
It's nice that Phoenix has many places similar to Luci's. We need these type of cafes here in Portland/ Vancouver."}
{"text":"A VERY cool little indie grocery store.  Completely organic, and really fun.  They have a food prep area and a coffee bar as well.  In the evening the place opens up to the street and has a great young hip vibe."}
{"text":"All the teas are delicious here - the herbal caramel apple is one of the most amazing teas I have ever had (and I consider myself a \"tea person\").  All their other teas are stellar too and they will sell it to you in 8oz quantities. 

Protip: After 3pm their blended green tea (like a smoothie/frappucino thang) is only $2 for a giant one!

Something that drives me bonkers about this place is that they refrigerate their desserts. Cakes should not be refrigerated. I understand putting leftover cake in the fridge at the end of the day, but during opening hours they should just be in a pastry case.  If I am ordering a slice \"for here\" I want to be able to eat it NOW and not let it sit on my table for half an hour to defrost.  That said, the desserts look divine (edible glitter - heck yeah!!) but only taste mediocre and on the dry side."}
{"text":"I dig the vibe as well as the ambiance and an extremely pleasant staff are always willing to assist.  The food was pretty decent... I had the Luci's famous burger with potato salad, my wife and daughter had pancakes.  They were both very pleased with their meal, I thought my meal was pretty good too.  

Overall, a pretty dang good experience.  I'd definitely recommend Luci's."}
{"text":"I have ordered online and over the phone and everytime it has been a great process.Their food is healthy and organic and high quality. I love all of the various natural foods in the grocery area, many of which are from local sources. I also love the fun and quirky gifts and am tempted to purchase something each time I am here. The parking can be challenging, especially around lunchtime. I love the open roll top garage doors that they open when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! Everyone is so friendly & it is just a nice casual hangout/study/work place. The coffee is DELICIOUS! Seriously. Bummed I don't live closer because I crave the coffee all the time!! I find the food average, not my go-to for that aspect. But the coffee and atmosphere keep me going back!"}
{"text":"This place rocks!! There are two gentlemen (one with blonde)  who have continually served with really high levels of customer service. Perfect place for coffee, breakfast and brunch!!"}
{"text":"After visiting there this morning. I was very impressed. The staff was so friendly,  the food was beyond fantastic,  & the prices & selection are awesome. The atmosphere I think is very relaxing. I can't wait to go there for brunch on the weekend to see how the place fills up."}
{"text":"Needs improvement.  But still the best joint in the area.  

Pros: lots

Con: took 20 min to get an overpriced acai bowl.  Then it was soupy with still big chunks frozen, 6 slices of banana and 6 whole blueberries.  Wow.  Over the top for a $10 dish.  A couple tablespoons of granola in a silly flat bottom wood bowl served with some silly big wood cooking spoon.   It was by far the worst acai bowl I've ever had in every way.  

For an overpriced market and cafe I'd expect higher quality.  It's a step above Starbucks but that's not saying much.  

Still I like the place just probably won't be a regular"}
{"text":"Yes! Health food, drinks, and entrees to order. Sonoran White chocolate ale and Yuma soft medjool dates makes a fantastic dessert. Gluten-free waffle with with on the side and extra strawberries makes a delicious breakfast.

I liked it so much that I purchased the T-shirt! The manager was nice enough to mail me an accurate size as I ordered a size too small!"}
{"text":"I've been excited to review Luci's all day since visiting for breakfast this morning. I've been frequenting Luci's for quite some time and the experience has always been really great, but today especially just impressed me.

First of all, you should know that Luci's is one of those *hot* Phoenix spots - a truly unique community offering, quite unlike anything else in the area. In addition to being a \"coffee shop\", Luci's has a full market including food, supplies, beer, wine, and even toys!

The food and drinks they serve are really very good, albeit somewhat expensive. (I never mind the cost, though, because the overall experience is always so solid.)

Today, the place was pretty packed. As in: nowhere to park, all seating taken, and a long (and growing!) line just to order. My friend and I almost turned around and went somewhere else just to avoid the crush of people, but I'm glad we didn't.

The line actually moved pretty quickly and we were met by a very bright, positive young lady at the register. She was very excited about Luci's and very excited about vegetables. Haha! I regret not having gotten her name. She was great.

Surprisingly, we were able to snag a table.

**AND NOW, TIME FOR A SHOUT-OUT TO HANNAH & MORGAN:

In an effort to keep this email somewhere shy of book-length, I won't go into all the reasons why two servers in particular really impressed me, but I will say that the service that Hannah and Morgan provided was ON POINT. And not just for us, but for EVERYONE! These two were so quick and so positive and so attentive, even to what I would have considered to be \"problem customers\" - I was truly blown away.

THANK you, Hannah and Morgan, for being such bright and positive influences today. Thank you for making my day. And thank you, Luci's, for hiring awesome people.

If you haven't been to Luci's, you need to stop reading long reviews like this one and just go already. You'll love it. Maybe I'll even see you there!  ;)"}
{"text":"It's like an adorable, crunchier version of Whole Foods. I also like that they offer cooking classes and integrate the market and coffee shop seamlessly."}
{"text":"I am into eating healthy, but I don't believe it should cost an arm and a leg to eat well, otherwise I will just cook for myself. Luci's has a great selection of really good healthy food on their menu and the prices are super reasonable. I tend to get the \"Cluck Cluck Salad\" which is delish....but I am very game for trying other things.

I have yet to actually cruise the aisles and see what actual groceries they sell but I am sure they will seduce me one day.

Great after a workout or a hike or yoga, the freshly squeezed oj is definately a must for me!!!  Great feel to the place, casual and ambient and open and just love it!!"}
{"text":"I abosolutely adore Luci's!!! I heard about this place by the tattoo removal shop in the same strip mall and have been a loyal customer ever since. I first fell in love with this place when I was trying to find a coffee place that caters to Vegan tastes (meaning, having vegan milk other than Soy). I was coming in for almond milk & soy milk lattes with hazelnut flavoring, when one day I came in and their espresso machine wasn't working. Samantha suggested for me to try the \"Toddy\" coffee with my usual flavoring, I did and I AM A TODDY FANATIC!!! I come in atleast once a day for this amazing drink. I did some research online about Toddy and it turns out it is great for people who love coffee but can't have it because of digestive upsets. SInce it is cold-brewed it has 67% lower acidity levels than hot-brewed coffee. They even named the drink I get because I come in so much, seriously, ask for it \"The Jennoddy\" No Joke. I like recycling so I re-use my cup as well (I have the 32oz & 20oz ones) and they give you a discount for reusing your cup! They also have great snacks for kids so it's no biggie if you need to bring in your little one. I love that this place is truely independant and the employees actually care about you as not only a customer, but a person (unlike their across the street diagonal corner neighbors)."}
{"text":"Yay another cute place with shitty parking!

Been here a few times to grab coffee and something to eat before work, had the jerk chicken pre-made sandwich which was great-and they don't skimp you on the chicken, nice and hefty I could only eat half the sandwich! Coffee is not spectacular but does the job. I love that they offer green and a specialty iced tea. 
Super cute sitting area, I love the open-air atmosphere. 

I'm going to chalk it up to the fact that it's brand new...but I can't help but feel like it needs something. It's like you walk in for the first time very excited but leave feeling like...that's it? It needs more, more products, maybe more use of the cooking area in the back, the pastry case needs more than the endless display of slices of cake-which I haven't launched my assault on but intend to. 
A welcome addition to the neighborhood nonetheless, I will continue to be back!"}
{"text":"LUCI'S FAMOUS ALL NATURAL BURGER : 10.99
A half-pound Niman Ranch all natural, grass-fed angus sirloin patty (cooked the way you like it) with saut√©ed mushrooms, red onion, apple wood smoked bacon and a choice of cheddar, Swiss or provolone cheese on a delicious brioche roll. Served with tater tots.  Sounds yummy? NOT... it was dry, lacked any flavor, the bun overcooked and tater tots dried out. We went at 7pm, one would have thought they were sitting on the stovetop all day. The person that served us ignored us after we were served, it was visually obvious everything was overcooked. I should have returned the food but my attitude anymore is to not sent it back, lest someone spit in my food. Should have went to Smashburger...a much better burger all around."}
{"text":"Great spot for coffee, or a meal. Food is healthy, really good and fresh. Never had a bad meal here, and the staff go above and beyond. Fun place to take people visiting, be prepared to wait a bit on the weekend...but this is normal for any good place. One has to get creative with parking, and patient."}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe. Perfect for a weekend breakfast or lunch. Coffee was delicious. To eat we got two different dishes. The burrito with sausage was great. Not too heavy and a ton of flavor. We also got the crabby omelette. It sounded like it would be a good pick with crab meat, salmon, and a bunch of veggies but I wasn't very impressed - it was definitely lacking flavor. That being said, I will definitely return to Luci's. There were a variety of menu items I would love to try in the future."}
{"text":"Neat little spot that I wish I lived closer to! 

Came here after an appointment nearby on a recommendation and am very glad I checked it out. While the layout is somewhat confusing, if not overwhelming to a newcomer - the fun is in the discovery: they have coffee .. And sandwiches ... And beer! And wine! And healthy things ... Etc. I got a turkey, avocado and pesto sandwich that was fresh, didn't skimp on the avocado (big plus), and delicious. Washed it down with a can of Scottish ale (for $1.97).  

Beyond the drinks and food there is also a small market comprised of mostly holistic and natural products, which I'm a fan of. You can also bring home random trinkets should the mood strike. 

Overall, a fun quirky place with seemingly delicious eats and drinks."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Luci's. Sadly, I did not. 

My parents are old, really old. Due to their chronic old-ness, they tend to have inflexible habits. Since I am not old, I don't share many of these routines. 

They like coffee, I drink tea. They need dessert whereas I don't eat sweets. On a recent weekend visit I decided to side step some of these issues by taking them to Luci's for dessert and coffee. 

Between the three of us we ordered three 12 ounce coffees, one cinnamon roll and two pieces of an apple tart. Total bill? $23 bucks... Ah well, I thought, you pay for quality. 

right? 

No. The cinnamon roll looked and tasted exactly like the deadly square things you can get at any convenience store. Even heated the frosting didn't loosen up, rather it kept its glue like consistency. 

The apple tart looked magnificent, however the flavor was severely lacking. The taste was like a fleeting thought of apple, as if I was remembering a good slice of pie. 

The coffee was simply OK, nothing great. 

I love the open feel to Luci's, and the patio area is great. The lunch menu has some very interesting options that I will come back to try. 

As I gazed longingly at the Starbucks across the street I realized that maybe, just maybe, my parents were on to something. If you don't try new things you probably won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Updating my review- I am keeping it at a three star, because it still isn't my favorite coffee and pastry/lunch place. BUT Luci's has grown on me. It's bright and airy. The staff is so so friendly. I love perusing all the random cutesy things they have for sale. So- while my rating has stayed the same, my attitude towards Luci's has become a little more loving. The coffee and food are still a bit overpriced for the quality, but they have such a  fun, friendly, and quirky atmosphere, that I have started frequenting the shop a lot more lately!"}
{"text":"I keep giving good ole Luci a try buy it seems like there is always something about my visits here that make me frustrated. I LOVE their iced tea, so maybe I need to stick with just that. 

My most recent upset? I got a $7 breakfast sandwich on an English Muffin and the muffin wasn't toasted! Have you ever eaten a 'non toasted' English muffin? Eew! Thankfully I got it to go and am currently in the process of toasting at home :(. Also, it was supposed to be scrambled eggs and it's not. It is just an omelet folded onto itself. I don't like omelets, that's why I ordered an egg sandwich! 

Sorry Luci but you can never quite hit the mark in my eyes. Boo!"}
{"text":"My hubby brought me here after he stumbled upon the spot and fell in love with their krabby pants omelet. For me it was love at first bite. I love the cool hippie style vibe of the place. It's mix between whole foods, trader joes, and Starbucks. 

I had the gluten free funky monkey French toast with a side of sausage and eggs...all sooooo yummy omg ! 

Hubby had the turkey burger with a side of dill potato salad and a fruit smoothie which was beyond delicious. The burger was super moist and delicious. It was topped with artichoke and roasted red pepper which gave it so much flavor. He wasn't a fan of the potato salad. Great healthy good in a cute cozy spot. 

My only gripe is the price. Spent $40+ on brunch yikes."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite spots in town. They have excellent real healthy food, grass-fed beef GF items and you can tailor your meal the way you want without them rolling their eyes and flipping you off in their pocket.  They also have a great space full of unique gifts, healthy food to go and the ambiance is the urban vibe with people from all walks of life.  Their bacon is also AMAZING. If you're in a hurry they have salads pre made daily with a HUGE selection of every kind of beverage. I've even met friends here and bought a 6 pack of Angry Orchard from their market to drink on premise. Way less expensive than a bar and the atmosphere can't be beat."}
{"text":"Luci's gets 3 stars  because of the overpriced nature of their products. I'd give it a 5 star if we were only discussing service. GREAT service every time you go. Very friendly, very kind workers. If you like overpriced lunch and breakfast food, maybe check this place out. The ambience and friendly staff make it worth going."}
{"text":"3/5 for food and 4/5 for service. To be clear, the food here is pretty darn good! It just never seems worth it, for the price, to me. We've been here a couple of times, and never had a bad experience, but I always leave feeling a little bit hungry. I don't think we'll be back.

Food: Good, but not a great value. We've had the biscuits & gravy (off-menu daily special) with sausage and sweet potato hash, lox and gluten-free bagel combo, Naughty Nurse sandwich (the most unique and delicious menu item we've had!), and huevos rancheros. All were good. I just don't know that they were worth the price, and none of them had very big portions.

Service: Depends on who you get - some of the staff are really sweet and helpful, and will go out of their way to make sure you have a great experience. Overall, we've had pretty good experiences, and have been happy with most people we've met."}
{"text":"I don't get over to this little place very often but really dig it.  The food is great, the coffee is yummy, and the grocery is fun to peruse.  The best part is the roll-up doors.  It's a great place to while away an hour or so and get some fresh air.  I am so glad to see that there are more choices in the world than SB."}
{"text":"Love it. Funky quirky gifty stuff. Healthy yummy smoothie bar and cafe. Quaint and limited natural foods selection + craft beers and wine."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful brunch with my boyfriend today. The food and service was excellent and I love a place that does breakfast all day. A plus is that they offer vegan and low cholesterol options for meat. Luci's little market filled with cute knick knacks from socks to notebooks."}
{"text":"My friend and her husband told me about this place since they know I:
1) love a good cup of joe, 2) am a bit of a health nut (arguably contradictory with #1 I know), and 3) like to support local/family-owned businesses.  That being said, it seemed Luci's was a match made in heaven.  

I agree with the majority of the other Yelpers that the coffee is pretty good.  I love the fact that they offer unsweetened vs. regular/vanilla soy because my usual poison of choice is a caramel soy latte but it's usually too sweet for me unless the unsweetened soy is used (how I make it myself at home).  Anyways, so the coffee is pretty great, and the food was decent, but I think it's a bit pricey for what you get.  I ordered an omelette which was tasty but the potatoes weren't that flavored or special.  

The service can be a bit unpredictable, perhaps because the one time we had bad service was on a weekend vs. the other times I've gone during the week...I know that's not an excuse, just an observation.  My friend's wife ordered a macchiato but apparently they didn't know what that was even though that was on the menu, and the girl at the register messed up on our order 3 times.  

Despite all that, I would still go back for the coffee, and wouldn't mind ordering their food again.  Also, they have a cool selection of vegan/gluten free/organic products to check out while you're waiting for your order."}
{"text":"Oooooh...I picked up a small chicken salad for lunch the other day and took a bite in the car.  Totally rancid!  I took it back in and the owner said \"Give her something else, no charge\"  The next thing I ordered was a turkey wrap, which the staff member pulled out of the same under refrigerated container.  The health department should take a look before someone gets sick.
I called the owner and he said he would \"look into it\"
Also, way too expensive for what you get"}
{"text":"I guess the environment is somewhat special because it's different than usual since there are groceries, food, and coffee. However I would not pay $10 for a burrito here again. There was nothing special about it. The coffee also wasn't special for $6. Overall, cool environment. Decent food."}
{"text":"We were all in town from places far and wide for a Thanksgiving in the sun and to share our Thanksgiving meal.  Tough to prepare that expansive feast in an unknown kitchen with unknown tools.  We didn't want our Thanksgiving dinner at a sit-down restaurant since we had rented a nice place on the border of South Mountain Park.  We opted instead for Luci's carry-out Thanksgiving meal with a bit of trepidation.  Was it going to be good... were they going to remember the cranberry relish... was the Fall salad going to be comprised of wilted lettuce?  We were a group of five and we unanimously each gave it five stars.  Not quite the same when you are cooking it yourself but as close as we thought you could get.  We picked up two large boxes on Thanksgiving day at 11am and with minimal prep had the meal on the table after a nice hike at 4pm.  They provided clear directions for the final finishes and it turned out great.  It met and beat our expectations by a wide margin.  Staff on the phone when we ordered and staff at Luci's when we arrived had us in and out in a matter of minutes with smiles and well wishes.  That Fall salad... no wilted lettuce to be seen but only fresh goodness!  Well done, folks!"}
{"text":"Luci's is one of my favorite places in all of Phoenix. As a Realtor, it's usually difficult to plan where I'm going to eat lunch on any given day, but if I'm within a 5 mile radius of Luci's, I always go to Luci's. Their lunch menu is well made and healthier than almost anything else you're going to find a fast-food-type place and their coffee is delicious. I've never had a bad meal there and the staff is always friendly and prompt.

If you haven't been to Luci's before, add it to your to-do list this week.

Also, they have free wi-fi!"}
{"text":"This place is right next to my house. I used to go a lot more often but i have realized they are the most expensive coffee in the area for the least tasty coffee. The baristas this don't make great coffee but they are really nice! It's a great place to sit and get some work done. They offer food which is reasonably priced. However, it is inconsistent - sometimes delicious but sometimes really bad. I like the \"dirty doctor\" melt and have learned not to experiment (don't get the lavash pizza!!!). They also have very hip groceries (for the organic soccer mom). Honestly i like the place but i usually go to the starbucks across the street now because the coffee is both better and less expensive. I hope they read this and dramatically improve their coffee!!! I will happily come back!!! Until then there are too many good options nearby (lola, lux, copperstar, shine, and even- gasp- sbucks)."}
{"text":"How to lose a devoted local business supporter to Starbucks: So, here's my story. I go to Luci's first thing in the morning, just before 7am. I'm the only person in line. It's broad daylight but they have these lights on overhead, and they need replacement, so two of them are blinking. Constantly. The thing about strobing lights is, if you have a disability, like I do, blinking lights can cause serious problems. Like seizures and ocular migraines. That's why theatres and concert venues have to put signs out warning people when they use them. So, I tell the barista that the lights are blinking and that they can cause seizures and that I need him to turn them off. He says, \"okay!\" And then proceeds to do... nothing. I wait. He didn't call a manager. Didn't take my order or ask how he could make me more comfortable or express concern. He *did* fix three more drinks while I stood there in obvious discomfort and he didn't do anything to serve me. And then I left. And went to the Starbucks across the street. 
Then I emailed Luci's and told them what happened. And just like that effing barista, they did... nothing. Didn't respond. No \"I'm so sorry, we fixed the lights and spoke with the barista.\" No \"Here's a coupon for your next drink, please come back, sorry we completely disregarded your disability.\" Just... ignored me. 
Then I emailed them again and expressed dismay that they absolutely ignored me. And they ignored *that.* 
And that, my friends, is how you lose a devoted local-business-only shopper... to Starbucks. Never going to Luci's again, because they suck."}
{"text":"This is a unique little hang out spot. I've held a few business meetings here and drink selection is fantastic and the food is delicious. Hang around and shop their unique selection of healty stuff and novelties."}
{"text":"I had one of the best salads I've ever had here. I'm usually hard to please when it comes to finding a hearty, healthy and filling salad but the Quinoa Goji Berry Super Salad was INCREDIBLE. I'm in town for a few days for work and it looks like I'm going to go there for coffee, breakfast, and lunch the next few days."}
{"text":"Amazing staff! Our order was made wrong and manager didn't hesitate to make it right. Great food and awesome iced coffee!!!!"}
{"text":"First time in Lucy's :) amazing service, and the breakfast burrito bomb was great. Definitely coming back here again to try something else on the menu :)"}
{"text":"This is a great place- EXCEPT- 

the employees start shutting down at least 45 minutes to an hour early whenever the owner isn't present. They herd everyone out right at closing time (after cleaning the place an hour before closing while you are trying to eat ). Prospective customers came in TWO NIGHTS in a row asking for coffee - around 8:30 the first night and 8:45 the second- and they were told that the registers had been shut down and that they could not purchase anything. 

Too bad- the owner is a class guy. However, unless he corrects this people will not come due to the tight parking and flippant employees."}
{"text":"Dear Luci, 

I love you, I really do. I look forward to my first drink of coffee from you as soon as I wake up. I love spending my spare time at your sister location. I know if I've had a cup of joe from Luci's my day is off to a good start. However, the fact that I have to wait KILLLLS me. I can't understand why 80% of the time only one person is working in the morning - I waited for a drink on Tuesday for 7 minutes, on a Friday when they had two/three people I waited 12 minutes..this doesn't include the line time that I waited to just place my order. - maybe you make me wait so I'll buy Chachkies..if that's the case well played."}
{"text":"Luci's is a cute marketplace located in the epicenter of what is quickly becoming the hottest area in the 602 for locally owned outstanding businesses.

My first experience with Luci's was after having dinner at The Garage, my pal I and wanted to grab a coffee. We went in at about 9:30, and I was surprised to find two Debbie Downers working the counter. I tried to make a small joke, to see if these were people, or if the zombie uprising was starting, but I am still uncertain.

Grabbed a coffee and cupcake and called it a night. The coffee was good and the cups were pretty cool, they had a built in heat sleeve, so you are wasting less paper. The cupcake was ok, but nothing to start a Facebook fan page over.

Second visit was again after a visit to The Garage (hey, I am a simple creature) this time on a Friday at lunch. Happily, I had a complete different experience, and the staff were downright sweet. There were five people in my group, and I was ordering/paying for us all. After ordering two drips, and a mocha, the girl happily expressed, \"Oh, I thought this was going to be a much more difficult order.\" It was kind of silly and sweet, almost like she meant to think that, and not say it, but her intentions were good, so I just told her we like to keep things simple. Walking over to prepare my coffee, another employee warmly greeted us and asked what we were up to today. It was a nice exchange, and it was great reflection on the place. I will chalk up my first experience to people being tired, I think we've all had days like that and no harm done."}
{"text":"Solid three. The. Place and the Feel is great. I wish they could follow with food well made. I have had the BLT and the 2 other food items that were made in the kitchen...all three times were a let down. I have the pre-made food from now on. 

I want to give 4* but they have to earn it.

|RL|

Note: LGO still wins as my fav brunch place."}
{"text":"Lucis is my favorite! I go there at least once a week.  I live in the neighborhood, and this is definitely a great addition to our area. I love the pomegranate citrus iced tea and the burrito bomb. Yum! Staff is very nice too. It's a good place to meet a client and they have decent wifi."}
{"text":"Hip little breakfast/brunch spot in Uptown Phoenix area. It's boasted as a marketplace as they do have lots of beer/wine/environmentally friendly products/goofy Knick knack gifts from magnets to books, print socks and tons of things crazy cat ladies will love.  It's a great spot for weekend brunch and coffee meet ups but it can get packed quickly so get there early. The menu is full of breakfast options from egg sandwiches to big full size flapjacks and lox and bagels and breakfast burritos to cure your hangover. They also have sandwiches and salads for quick on the go options and grab and go bottled drinks. The food is delicious and cooked to order and many can be gotten gluten free or veggie options. The coffee is above average and beats out Starbucks for sure and is still priced around the same as them or even less. If you've never been, I highly recommended checking it out. Come for the food and coffee, stay for the goofy marketplace."}
{"text":"Most of the employees here are so nice and goofy. I love it! 

My first time, I ordered a ham and provolone wrap with a tomato tortilla with a side of tater tots, a kale salad, and a sipp soda.
-The wrap was delicious! It was fresh and flavorful!
-I tried my mom's french toast and it was so good! I think it had cinnamon in it! 
-Lastly, the kale salad would of been enjoyable but the kale was overly bitter and I felt bad, but I had to return it. I HATE returning stuff. The employees there were so nice about it though, thankfully. 

On other occasions I had the turkey burger, the Madison Lavash, mimosa, and a caff√© caramel.
-The burger was good. Juicy and flavorful.
-The flatbread was BOMB! Very crispy and full of flavor. You must try it! 
-They were very generous on the mimosa if you know what I mean ;) and it was only $3! Winning!
-The caff√© caramel was good. Mellow and sweet just how I like it. 

Unfortunately, they messed up my parents plates once, tried to fix it, and forgot the main ingredients again. It was a wreck. Lol

I will say that parking sucks but that must mean something of the businesses parking lot is full. I also like that they have a mini market inside! I would compare this place to La Grande Orange but a smaller place. I SMELL COMPETITION!"}
{"text":"I've had my eye on Luci's for a long time, but never made it out this way because it's just a touch too far from my house for breakfast. But, crashing in Phoenix for a while, I thought this was the perfect opportunity to check it out. We came here on a Saturday morning around 9, and there was no wait to order or for a table. 

I had the egg sammie, with cheddar and sausage on an Asiago bagel. I was looking for something pretty simple and no frills, but this sandwich was amazing. I had prepared myself for a big ole mess, like most breakfast sandwiches are--especially on a bagel. But the sausage and cheese were folded into the egg, frittata-style, which made for very handy eating. Also... no joke, this was the best bagel I've had in the state of Arizona. It was dense, in a great bagely way, but somehow very soft even though it was toasted. And it even reheated well! The guy is going through an ultra-health kick, so he opted for an a√ßa√≠ bowl. It was very tasty, but I think could've been just a touch more frozen/less runny. Also just a touch pricey, but I guess a√ßa√≠ bowls usually are. 

We both had mimosas, because how can you turn them down then they're $3? I certainly don't have that kind of willpower. They were a touch sweeter than I like, but I fully acknowledge that when I make my own mimosas, they're 96% champagne with 4% juice. And definitely not bad at all for $3. 

My favorite part of Luci's for sure were all of the little knick knacks to peruse while you're waiting. Lots of fun AZ things and things no one needs, aka the best things to look through always. 

Midway through our meal, we started planning our next trip back. How could we not, when there are so many tasty-sounding menu items to try? :)"}
{"text":"Luci's Healthy Market Place started off with big promise, but lately has really slipped in the areas of customer service and cleanliness.  Offering breakfast, lunch and dinner, the place is cozy, fun and inviting. We love the Saturday Night Jazz and the great \"small bites\" from Chef Larry are the highlight of our week. He's personable, knowledgeable and a great Chef. We LOVE the food on Saturday, but can't say the same for during the week.  

Food has been sloppy, uneven on occasions, and plates are often messy during the weekday meals. Spotty shortages and lack of consistence makes for an frustrating experience. 

The coffee bar had great promise as well, but lately, Customer Service and Sanitation and organization has been spotty. Employees are often overwhelmed and look distracted, and the cafe is often messy and looks unclean.

If Luci's keeps up with the cleanliness, Customer Service and stays true to it's pleasant neighborhood concept, it'll do really well. Lots of competition now on this corner. 

Don't drop the ball, guys !  Management and the kitchen needs to step it up and keep us coming back !"}
{"text":"I'm in love.  And, when you are in love, even the flaws just add to the perfection of a person (didn't you know that?).  So, even though there are some small \"imperfections\", Luci's is a definite 5-star place.  I LOVE THEM.  I am seriously considering setting up a cot in the store... then I could wake up and have the most delicious coffee (mocha, always) and fabulous service without going to the effort of leaving my house.  Hmm... think they'd let me?  

Luci's has quickly become my most favorite neighborhood spot.  It is obviously helpful that it is super-close to my house... but there are plenty of other coffee places within a reasonable distance and no one comes close.  The entire concept is just genius - breakfast, lunch, dinner, bakery, cooking classes, cleaning products (all natural, of course), homeopathic remedies, locally sourced produce - my list could go on and on... 

My most favorite thing about Luci's - their service.  I can't even begin to describe how awesome their baristas and chefs are - everyone is so sociable and friendly. Who wouldn't like to come here?  Not only are they good at making drinks and food - but they'll even recommend some good music for you to add to your itunes collection.  Love it!

Of course, their food/drinks are pretty awesome too - I adore the mochas - Iced, hot, peppermint, whatever-  it is always good.  The pomegranate citrus iced tea is so refreshing. I think I might be addicted.  Other top-notch items include muffins (blueberry and double chocolate-chip, especially), pasta bar, the Naughty Nurse and Dirty Doctor sandwich melts (and the names just make it more fun!), and the freakin' fabulous soup we had the other night... some kind of African spices?  Lentils, beef... amazing stuff.   We've also loved their burger, omelets, creme-brulee cupcake, etc.  They always have a number of gluten-free options, and they are constantly adding new ones - THANK YOU!

The imperfections (still not phasing me - because I LOVE them) - wait time for meals can be pretty long, which isn't a big deal if I'm staying and chatting, but occasionally I'm just ordering food to take home and don't have enough time to wait and wait.  Didn't love the peach-oatmeal muffin... meh.  See? Minor issues.  Nothing we can't get past, and still live happily ever after."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened and were just a small coffee shop, now they have a great variety of things to shop for while you wait for your food or drink.  The food is so good, you cant really go wrong with anything you order.  The breakfast burrito is tasty and HUGE.  The pastries are yummy too."}
{"text":"This place is a less chaotic version on LGO, and I like it more! They owners are so nice and down to earth, and you can always find something ninteresting in here. I love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday night jazz night once and I've been here a couple of times for coffee. I really want to love this place but I just can't get into it. Each time I've been I haven't been moved by the coffee drinks and the veggie lavash pizza I had for dinner was just okay. 

The ambiance is great and I love the location. I just feel it's a little overpriced and the market holds very few things I couldn't find at Trader Joe's/Sprouts for a better price.

I can definitely see the appeal. Nice & healthy. I've been meaning to try their breakfast. Perhaps that will win me over..."}
{"text":"Cool place, my first time here. I stopped in around 2 for a late lunch figuring I would just miss the lunch crowd, the place was still packed though which is a sign of I guess how good the place is. 

The food I ordered was fresh and good, the employees were friendly and the place overall was clean. 

If it's your first time like it was for me, it takes you a moment as there is a lot going on inside lol. There is a general store type inside with healthy food items and a lot of  \"stuff\" like little oddities which I didn't get a chance to look around as to how busy and compact the area was. 

Parking......OMG....haha. It is freakin a nightmare, good luck with that! There is parking in the back but even that was packed when I went. It is on a busy corner and the strip mall is busy itself with very limited parking so it make take you a minute to find a spot. Just know that in advance and you'll be great .  

Overall good place, I'll be back to try their coffee another day."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Their omelets and potatoes are awesome. Great coffee. I strongly recommend Luci's for breakfast!"}
{"text":"The menu has everything you could possibly want for either breakfast or lunch. Pretty good crowd, not a wait though, on this holiday morning. Looks like they forgot to build a big parking lot for this grocery store also. Nothing on the shelves could not be found at either Whole Foods or Sprouts. The pastries and bagels are not made on site, therefore it's best to utilize the sandwiches or egg/pancake fresh items made to order. Great choice on my part going with the breakfast bomb (burrito). A very unusual version made with alot of very colorful potatoes, most of which are organic because there were sweet, purple, yellow and white potatoes in there. Other ingredients were only eggs of course, finely chopped hickory bacon and cheddar cheese, but not alot like in Mexican places. Also, you get your choice of three tortillas flavors and sun-dried was my choice. Great burro for $7.99 and worth it for the solid parts inside. It looks nothing like any standard Mexi burrito. They give you a nice mild salsa on the side, but you will need more if you eat the whole thing (a challenge unless your starved). Grabbed a fresh lemonade at $3.25 for a good holiday breakfast."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I truly did. I love the concept of store and restaurant in one. The building was hot, like uncomfortable hot. I went to study and I couldn't stay long because it was so uncomfortable in there. The tables are super close together and that with the heat - little claustrophobic. The food was ok. I got the burger. I felt it was overpriced and not much flavor but the quantity of food is legit. The coffee is good and that was the bright spot. I would probably run in for a coffee from time to time, but I wouldn't stay. The staff was friendly, but I just wanted to get out of there. I wanted this to be my new spot, but sadly it's just not for me."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was nice too, but somethings were a little off:
my burrito was sort of flat, not rounded, and the sour cream (which I thought they forgot to serve, along with the salsa) was actually already in the burrito. The description of the meal didn't mention any cheese, but then the staffer asked what kind of cheese I wanted. Fair enough, but my friend has the same thing happen! Her tuna sandwich came with horseradish...which the description didn't mention either....and she hates horseradish. So all in all, ok, but sort of a really sad knock off of LGO."}
{"text":"I love the fact that it's kitty corner from a Starbucks and still holds it's own.

I'll be honest, I have never taken an offered cooking class, bought that many items at the marketplace or hung out for the atmosphere...

...but I do partake in the coffee bar and love it. I always avoid the temptation of their amazingly wonderful looking morning eats and sweets, and I don't know how I continue to resist. 

I get my Chai Tea Latte or my sugar with coffee and cream (just like Mike D.) and head into work. I love the vintage fun feel you get and the neighborhood environment is nifty. 

I guess I need to expand and try one of their cooking classes or at least hang out and give the atmosphere a chance to sink in.

Though it doesn't have the drive through like the Starbucks I mentioned earlier, it does have a pretty fast moving coffee bar set up and barista. Even if I am running tight for work, I still take the time to park, get off my tush and walk into Luci's because it really does help brighten my day... and walking off with their cute blue and orange to go cup reminds you to smile as you walk into the office."}
{"text":"I was so bummed today about my breakfast. I normally love Lucy's! Always raving about it and bringing new people here. My husband and I both ordered the special: Eggs Benedict. I understand they are busy, fine and we waited. 20 minutes later with finally got one of the plates. It was cold, egg yokes were broken, and the eggs whites were super runny... Slimy! Then they brought the second plate out and the yokes were hard. If we weren't in such a crunch for time I would have asked about what was going on because this was out of the norm for them. We will be back but I wanted to let them know."}
{"text":"I don't get it.  Why the good reviews?  OK, the marketplace is really pretty cool, but nothing too, too special.  And the menu SOUNDS wonderful but...

After receiving great service while ordering, I waited...and waited...and waited for my three egg omelet.  I had to finally ask about it and when it arrived?  ICK!  Brown, dry omelet, and the potatoes were like hockey pucks.  Really pretty bad, I thought.

Disappointing because place definitely has atmosphere."}
{"text":"While this place does have an extensive menu - the wait is ridiculous.  You get a number and sit at a table waiting for your food.  This is even if you order to go.  I waited over 15 min for a breakfast sandwich  - which still came out wrong.  The sandwiches on the lunch menu sound so enticing that I decided to try it again.  I called in an order this time and went to pick it up 5 min later than they said - still not ready.  The prices are way higher than anywhere else around there and it is honestly not worth it."}

Yelp review
Luci's Healthy Marketplace
1590 E. Bethany Home Rd. Phoenix, Arizona 85014¬∑ ~9.8 mi (602)-773-1339

I have lived in Arizona for all my existence and I have not found a breakfast joint I have loved, until I stumbled upon Luci's Healthy Market Place. I may be bias but they have the best pancakes I have even had. Growing up my parents always took me to IHop and Denny's but I always felt like I wasn't doing my body any good. Most breakfast joints only have dishes that are super unhealthy and too sweet to be consumed in the morning. Luci's is an amazing place to lay back and relax. My go to dish is the \"Big Boy Breakfast\" it's amazing and I recommended it to any \"first timers\". It doesn't take too artificial or over processed and you feel satisfied afterwards. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day and Luci's is the place to start the day.

When you first walk into Luci's, one might be overwhelmed because there is an actual market within the restaurant. The market has many organic goods that are unique and you wouldn't be able to find at any Wal-Mart. When I go, I always find myself looking at the knick-knacks that are so cute and tempting to buy. The aesthetic of Luci's is very sweet. It has a very retro vibe yet very rustic. The actual restaurant is very small, sometimes I must admit, it gets really tight and overwhelming. You wait in line to order and wait for the server to serve your food. The wait is very short, even when there is many people ordering food. It's kid friendly and accommodating for many people in a hurry. 


One time, my mom and I ordered a Green Tea smoothie and as we stepped outside to enjoy the day, I, of course, dropped my smoothie and go it all over my shoes and the pavement. I went in side to get some napkins to clean my shoes. I wasn't going to ask for a new drink because I was too embarrassed, but a server saw what happened from a far and ordered me a drink without even asking. Once I was done cleaning myself up, I saw a server coming towards me with a new Green tea smoothie. When she handed it to me, I was so happy and grateful. I tried to tip her, but she didn't let me. I expressed my gratitude, and left. With that being said, the service at Luci's is amazing! They always go the extra mile and they really made my day a whole lot better. Service really makes a difference and I recommend this place to anyone and everyone. 



The server, Amanda, that replaced my drink was amazing and I always look for her whenever I visit Luci's. When I think of making good eating habits, I think of Luci's. Their potions aren't outrages and are satisfying. This local joint is very popular in my part of town and you can always expect an amazing time when you go. I give Luci's Healthy Market Place, 5 out of 5 stars for amazing everything! Please try this place, its amazing and healthy! Replace IHop with Luci's and it will change your life!"}
{"text":"Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but my breakfast sandwich was pretty terrible. I'd rather eat a sausage mcmuffin with egg from mcdonalds. I sampled some other food from my friends and they were slightly better but nothing to write home about. The atmosphere of the place was nice though."}
{"text":"Adorable spot. Great salads and sandwiches. Hard to park.  Cute shop items inside too."}
{"text":"I don't like that they have two counters and still force a to go order to walk up to the main counter and wait in the line for their order. Then what the hell do they have the second counter for then?! To go orders are a pain here and completely unpredictable since you walk in and sometimes there's a person at the second counter taking your to go order and sometimes you need to wait in the main line for the order. It is not efficient and the food is so so, and not worth the pain in the ass to order and lines can get long during rushes. They also do not provide any condiments for to go orders such as ketchup, hot sauce, Tabasco, nothing! Unless you ask for it... The food is ok here but if you are ordering to go I would not suggest coming here until they provide a more time efficient way to get your food."}
{"text":"Simple food, great ambiance, a inexpensive menu. We had the Greek omelet, it just needed more feta & I would have gave them 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff very unique place with a great energy.  Love the specials they have daily and they have great coffee.  This is a must try spot for breakfast"}
{"text":"Quality food in a relaxing atmosphere would best describe Luci's. 
I ordered the grass fed burger with a side salad. 
The burger was cooked to a perfect medium and it was super juicy. The saut√©ed mushrooms and bacon finished the burger perfectly. If you are a bread freak you will fall in love with the challah bun. 
The side salad was a nice combo of greens, fresh cherry tomatoes and artichoke hearts. 
When you are done eating they have a fun market section that is worth browsing thru."}
{"text":"Love this! Heathy options and a great place to grab a quick lunch with a friend or to get some work done! The food is delicious. Especially the bacon. Whatever you do- order something with bacon on it! It's so good."}
{"text":"Been here before. Just ate next door and stopped by here to get a drink. Grabbed a sweet green tee and a slice of classic cheesecake. Menu is great as well as the grab and go options. Highly recommended. Breakfast here is amazing. French toast is my favorite item."}
{"text":"Oh Luci's... what am I going to do with you?

On one hand, I love you. You've got very nice staff, good service and a great atmosphere. (I especially like the art-deco bathrooms) but your coffee is just meh. Maybe your other products are great but the iced coffee always tastes bland. I see you every time I come out of work and I know Starbucks is across the street, I just would really like some less bitter, more coffee-tasting coffee.

I REALLY want to like you because I'd rather give my money to you instead of Starbucks (nothing against Starbucks, I just want to help the littler guy as much as possible.) 

I haven't had anything else on the menu really, I just stop in for coffee, maybe it's fantastic, who knows?"}
{"text":"What a wonderful cool little place!

I had a roast beef and horseradish sandwich with the best potato salad I have ever tasted!!! I lived most of my life in Austin Tx  and the south prides themselves on their potato salad! Luci's if by far the best!
Our real estate agent took us there and I'm still thanking her for a wonderful lunch!

 I currently Live in Albuquerque and just ate close to the same sandwich here at Flying star it was repulsive. 

Luci's is wonderful and you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"update; their food effing sucks... so far i've tried the chicken salad with pita bread and the grilled chicken salad, both were pre-made sitting in a cooler... the chicken salad had about as much flavor as my vitamins i take everyday and the grilled chicken on my salad was tough and unpleasant... i will not get another 9 dollar peice of crap meal here ever again."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat! The food here has never disappointed. I had stopped here for lunch a few times, but today I went for breakfast, and I was totally impressed with my food. I had the French Toast- it was great! You can't go wrong with any of the food or coffee here. This place is somewhat like La Grande Orange- but without the huge, swarming crowds."}
{"text":"Delicious find!! Not from this area, and really took the exit for Starbucks, missed the turn and found this place on the opposite corner!

Thank goodness, because I'll make this a regular stop when on this side of town from now on!

Yes, it's really that delicious!"}
{"text":"Listen, the coffee is great. That's a no-brainer.  And, looking to support local business, I decided to switch up my morning routine from the always packed, never enough parking and long line drive-thru, Starbucks across the street. 

That said, I stopped into Luci's quite a few times the past month for my morning fuel (not just as a weekend treat) only to find no waiting. Good start but perhaps a little telling now that I have tested my hypothesis of coffee stops.  

I don't mind a little conversation while ordering but to repeat my order three times....I am wondering if I am speaking Italian and don't realize it.  Don't get me wrong, the baristas are friendly but I don't need to be made aware of every detail that the night crew didn't clean up or prep for the morning or that it's \"a little too early to be up and moving\" at 7:15am. Is that not the shift for those of you that make up part of our morning routine when I am more than willing to fork over $4.97 for a large iced coffee with some sugar free vanilla syrup? Just sayin'. 

I love the store, concept and the coffee...but for just an OK experience, I might go back to making my coffee at home and putting that money in my vacation fund."}
{"text":"Why have I not been coming here for years?

I always went to the Starbucks across the street for coffee and treats, but never will I go there again if I can help it.

Luci's Healthy Marketplace has the best breakfast! It's REAL food. I had their caramel latte and that was good too.

I was glad to see that on a Saturday morning, it was packed. I like the boost that it gives to the local economy. 

I've spoken with Luci before, she's a really nice lady. I'm sure I'll be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Great post hike breakfast spot. The Greek Omelet is amazing. Well, as amazing as an omelet can be, I guess. It's, like, not a breakfast burrito or anything. Still though, it's something good enough to get excited about.  

Oh, what's that? You don't get excited AF about food? Then go eat at a Good Egg and stop pretending. You're basic. 

Also, can someone please tell me why I always have to order iced coffee AND iced tea? Like seriously, Morgan, it's one or the other. I don't even think caffeine works on me anymore. I just double fist my way through every morning (and every night).

(I kid.)     

(Ha ha.)

(God, I'm hilarious.)

(At least to my mom.)"}
{"text":"Upon first pulling up to and entering Luci's there does not seem to be much to like about this place, let alone to get excited about.  However, I decided to give it a try for lunch one day.  What can I say?  I LOVE THIS PLACE! Granted there is absolutely nothing special about the atmosphere and the patrons were not quite as eclectic as I thought they would be (OK I used to hang out in Greenwich Village a lot when I lived in NY).  But the \"something special\" is right where it counts... The wonderful food and friendly staff.

If you are looking for unbelievably great tasting, organic, fresh and healthy food; this is the place to go.

My first time there I had the Humm-Dinger Vegan Wrap. This wrap had artichokes, zucchini, red bell peppers (all roasted to perfection), fresh and I mean FRESH spinach along with hummus and balsamic. For my side I had the homemade asiago penne salad and an herbal iced tea to drink.  The wrap was by far the best tasting wrap I have ever had anywhere! The penne salad was very good and it was a nice small portion (just the right size).  The herbal iced tea was absolutely full of flavor and the portion size on the wrap was great. If I were hungrier I could have consumed the whole wrap, but as it were I took half of it home and enjoyed it just as much the next day.

Yes, I really do love this place.  I have now been back for a third time and I have never been disappointed. The other dishes I have tried are: The Portobello \"Shroom\" Burger (absolutely fantastic!) and the Low Carb Gobbler Wrap (again another fresh and delicious choice).

I now look forward to going here much more often for lunch and I want to try their breakfast too.  Something tells me I won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I popped in here for a yummy breakfast with a sweet friend before visiting the Farmer's Market this past Saturday. We loved our experience! First, you walk in to their adorable marketplace with so much to look at. If you're in need of a unique gift, come to Luci's, they're sure to have something that will catch your eye!

For breakfast, I ordered their Acai Bowl and my friend and I split a gluten free bagel. You guys, the bagel was DELICIOUS! Not all gluten free bagels are the bees knees but this one WAS. I also had an iced latte! The Acai bowl could have been a little colder and not as runny. It also didn't have much to it for over $10. Just the Acai mixture, bananas, blueberries, and some granola. Pretty basic. It wasn't the best one that i've ever had. I also love that they're dog-friendly! I'll definitely think about bringing my furbaby in the future! It is kind of pricey for breakfast. For my pretty simple breakfast it was $20 which seemed a little high. Anywho, I love the ambiance - good vibes all around - so we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my list to check out. I like the setting. A find. 
Rare healthy food options. Fresh, tasty and a different environment.
Good for friends, families or just on your own.

Plus there are nice lil' stores to check out nearby."}
{"text":"Nice staff. Good coffee. Casual atmosphere. Noisy, with ppl shopping, visting. Very airy and open. Real enjoyed it."}
{"text":"What a cute place!  I love the options in the market and on the menu.
While my breakfast sandwich was just mediocre (blame it on the bland english muffin and the sandwich having cooled off between being cooked and being served), I still this place is great and I look forward to trying other menu items.
I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"I want to love Luci's.  I want Luci's to be my favorite place in the hood...but I am just not cool enough to hang out there.

I've been in many times - whether for a coffee and dessert after dinner at Golden Phoenix, a quick coffee to go, or to peruse and purchase some yummies for home.

When Ken and Luci are there, the staff is amazing.  When they're not on site (or at least out front) - it's pulling teeth to get the baristas to make a drink.  Last visit, there were THREE people behind the coffee counter, ZERO people on line ahead of me...and I still had to wait for someone to offer to make me something.  And that was to order a drink and pay for over $50 worth of groceries!  I'd think with that much merchandise on the counter by the register, a smile and hello wouldn't be too much to ask.

I may up the stars after one of the cooking classes (if I ever get a Sunday eveing off work!).  And when Ken and/or Luci are there, I'd give the place 4 stars.

I admire what they brought to the area, and adore the concept, layout and selection.  If only the staff were more enthusiastic and customer service oriented.  Maybe I just don't look rich enough, or hipster enough or young enough to be worthy of their time...but I promise, my money spends just as well."}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood coffee shop. The staff is very courteous and polite and everything is always done right"}
{"text":"I love Lucis. Their green tea smoothies are delicious and their burrito bomb is the best breakfast burrito in Phoenix (in my opinion, of course). The only problem is it's pretty pricey so my trips there are reserved to when I'm feeling a little wealthy, but I still can appreciate a good breakfast place, no matter the price."}
{"text":"Decent food. I had the Greek omelette. The other diner have the sunrise with a side order of a bagel and cream cheese but did not arrive till we asked for it a third time at the end of the meal.

Very long and somewhat confusing ordering system. Sales prevention on additional items since you'd have to go all the way back to the other side of the place and get back in line. Thus I did not get one of their wonderful looking cinnamon rolls, but found it easier to get into my car and drive to sprouts for a piece a cake."}
{"text":"Luci's is a great little neighborhood spot. They have a coffee bar that offers great lattes and teas, etc... The staff is awesome, not sure why some reviewers seem to think otherwise. They are friendly, remember your name and always show a sense of urgency. The parking is pretty tight, so you might have to circle around the back of the shopping center once or twice. The menu offers some great sandwiches and salads, as well as some special diet options. They have some gluten-free items on the main menu and I believe they have the same in dessert/pastry items. One of my favorite things is breakfast and it's offered all-day at Luci's! The marketplace portion itself is pretty cool, not huge, but has a decent amount of shelf space to hold products usually found at Whole Foods. Lots of seating room and they have a big rolling garage-style door that opens the cafe area to the outside. It's especially nice in the spring and fall times. Beer and wine are also available in their coolers and they have dairy items as well. They also sell random funny things all over the place. Sarcastic magnets and notepads, etc... Check this place out, it's definitely worth a shot!

Tip: For quicker service, call in your order ahead of time!"}
{"text":"Awesome local products and produce. My new favorite grocery store!"}
{"text":"Lucy's market has delicious food as well as little mic knacks you can't find anywhere else. The staff is always friendly and the prices are reasonable. If you like cool caf√©s and are interested in a healthy life style then this spot will be a hit for you! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Luci's...you know - it was pretty good, and had a lot of cool stuff (in addition to food and drink), but I'm just not their demographic.  It was mostly younger ladies (under 40) and hipster dudes.  

Solid place, but not my vibe."}
{"text":"For me, Luci's really hasn't lived up to the hype. I've tried their burger (meh..) and a couple of their sandwiches. The breakfast burrito has been the best thing I've tried so far and it was super good on the sun-dried tomato wrap. 

Overall, the atmosphere is awesome but the food is just okay for the price."}
{"text":"What keeps me coming back is the stellar service, the delicious green tea and yummy 'Hot Juan Black Bean Burger' that automatically comes with avocado (YIPPEE!). My only complaint is that with as busy as they are it's hard to find a spot to park or if you want to bring your laptop and work the tables are typically full. None the less, I always leave this place with a smile."}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere. And a good place to hangout with friends or by yourself. The people at the coffee bar are AWESOME! But as far as the food. It's disgusting. They hide behind the word \"healthy\". The eggs come out of a box and the portion sizes are too big. There is nothing \"healthy\" about Luci's."}
{"text":"Amazing. Service was fantastic and the food was delicious. Adorable store. The entire family enjoyed this venue."}
{"text":"Best coffee in town! This little jewel has been in our neighborhood for a while now and has become a local hangout. Great service! The team makes a point of knowing your name which is genuinely nice when your greeted coming through the door. 

The menu is eclectic and not short on flavor. But the coffee...it's great. 

If you don't know the story behind Luci's take minute and read about it...it'll bless your soul."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Everyone is always nice. Brandon the barista who works in the mornings during the week really makes the place. He is always super nice and and remembers a lot of the regulars names."}
{"text":"Luci's is a totally cool new space and idea in the shopping plaza on the NWC of Bethany Home & 16th Street. I'm really happy with what they have done with the place and they have a great idea going. Only problem is that they might need to expand with it. I walked in expecting more of a small grocer/cafe but found it to be mostly a nutritional supplement store with slim pickins. The prepared foods section is scary tiny, with only one vegetarian option. The grocery section is tiny and reminds me of some sort of mash up between Sprouts/Healthy Habit/Cost Plus. Overall an interesting place and idea but needs to improve the selection/variety of specialty grocery goods and pre-prepared foods."}
{"text":"When I had time to spare or happen to miss my turn on my way to work I LOVE to splurge and visit Luci's for their absolutely amazing coffee. 

I've been here a few times and always forget that I want to shop for random gifts when I'm there! So FYI not only is their coffee to die for, you'll want to buy all of your girlfriends gifts while you're there! 

The only thing, if you're a weirdo like me, is depending on the temperature you prefer your coffee you may need to order extra hot. The normal temp they seem make their drinks at is more on my definition of warm when I prefer hot.

Cheers and I can't wait to visit wiry enough time to order food!"}
{"text":"Had a perfect lox bagel. Had the universal bagel I guess and it was super aromatic and it had good amount (a lot) of cream cheese. And plenty of lox and capers, and blue onion! 
The place is also lovely as it has open windows and it feels like a terrace! I could only wish real cups for the coffee! :)"}
{"text":"I used to really like Luci's for its fresh food, good service, and the fun vibe of the Sunbrite plaza it's in. The two last visits were disappointing -- long, slow lines, barely anywhere to sit, and the food was just okay. My breakfast \"sammie\" was cold but had a nice flavor from the bacon. It comes with no sides. I overheard a manager explaining to a patron the somewhat complicated ordering system as \"fast casual.\" I'm not sure about the fast part - if by \"casual\" we mean \"disorganized\" then I'll vouch for that. They deliver your food to you but you have to get your beverage yourself. After I stood around in the crowded area around the coffee bar for ten minutes and got my latt√©, I returned to my seat to find someone else in it, even though my plate had been dropped off. I relocated to the chef bar by the kitchen to eat my lukewarm sandwich in peace -- only to be bugged by a family asking to have my seat since everything else was occupied. I would have liked to get a water, but there was no one to ask and I didn't feel like going back in the long line. It's just too much money for the hassle and miserable experience. It's also unfortunate that all the fun little shops that used to give the plaza its character are gone. It could be any blas√© strip mall in Phoenix now. I'll look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Luci's for well over five years. The food is always high quality, the staff is attentive friendly and outgoing. While the grocery selection is small, if you're in a pinch whatever they have in stock always works for me."}
{"text":"Luci's is a comfort food stop with a huge dose of healthy. Yesterday I had a turkey wrap; it had a healthy serving of romaine with the substantial turkey and bacon. The dressing was awesome in this wrap too - I'm guessing it was a homemade Green Goddess. 

Service is always friendly. (Amazingly, the server responded immediately when they served it as a sandwich. No blame game but let us redo as a wrap for you!)

I've also tried the burgers & fries here. The dish makes me want to redo/ copy the 5 Guys DAMN YouTube. DAMN.

A detour to this corner requires planning and patience to park, and perhaps walk a bit. However, those two steps lead to a nice reward."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of their moment of zen smoothie drink. But they also have incredible brunch. They have a new special (as far as I know) every Saturday. They even make a real sample to display on the counter. The portions are small but definitely filling. Also they have an Acai bowl which is pretty hard to find in Phoenix. 

The place also doubles up as a small market that has some unique offerings. If they're not busy you can easily peruse their store before grabbing a seat for your meal."}
{"text":"Parking sucks, food is good but please GET SOME PERSONNEL TO CLEAN TABLES, every time we go there's available tables but with trash on them,u ask someone to clean it off and there so busy they say ok and never come back, after the second time u ask again it's like a bother and go with attitude to clean it, (that's your job hello) anyways there food is delicious just need to work on keeping the restaurant clean"}
{"text":"I stopped in for coffee and noticed the \"molasses and ginger\" cookies. I asked the order taker person if that was like gingerbread. She said,  \"No, it's like ginger and molasses. \" Ok. No tip. Did not buy the cookie, and I'll NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Came here this weekend after a hike with our pup.  The side of the building was open and we were able to sit at a table without any problem.

They offer $3 mimosas (at least on the weekend, I am trying to recall) with fresh orange juice.  Those were amazing!  

We had the krabby pants omelette and it was pretty good, but I don't think it quite lived up to the price.  

Also, prepared for everything to be crowded, you may not mind that at all.  I always find it a little weird to have to stalk people who are almost done eating to grab their tables, it makes for some awkward eye contact.  

I would highly recommend for a nice place to unwind and enjoy yourself with company!"}
{"text":"I'm giving you five stars because I love you. And I truly think you deserve it. 

But it's early. I'm tired. I just ordered a coffee and two of my four modifiers were wrong. ICED? Check. BLACK? Check. LARGE? What the hell is this puny little bastard? FRENCH VANILLA? There were no pumps of anything in there. 

Your coffee is the best. At least to me. But when I'm thinking about waking up and getting it the night before and the morning comes and I'm totally disappointed, it's such a challenge to pull myself from this mood. 

Did you hear that Starbucks just implemented a rule that the baristas can't make more than two drinks at once? It's because we're only human and we fuck shit up. Sure, there was a line, but it wasn't out the door. Just relax and listen to the order. Repeat it back. Only work on, at max, two things at once. 

I would have just said something but I knew I would be rude and I didn't want to be mean so I just kept my mouth shut. 

Anyway, I read some of your others reviews and I don't think a lot of people are being fair. For the space, I think your choices for healthy foods are inspired. They are the right combination of appeal to the masses and appeal to the hippies. 

All I want is a really big coffee. 32 fluid ounces. Please. It's important that it's right. If I want a shitty, expensive drink I can go across the street to *$."}
{"text":"Been there twice-once for breakfast and the other time for a coffee and gluten-free treat. Both experiences were wonderful! I recommend the Crabby Pant omelette and gluten free flapjacks! Nice vibe and great open indoor/outdoor patio. Nice selection of snacks and love the organic coffee! Parking is challenging if busy!"}
{"text":"I tried to be optimistic but just couldn't love really anything about the place. Maybe the pretty color scheme? 

Coffee was just okay. There was nothing special that I couldn't get elsewhere. We went there for brunch and since the breakfast menu offered such an average selection, we ordered a sandwich instead. I don't recommend the Po Boy sandwich, which took over 20 minutes to make and tasted like s***. Sorry, but this is the reason why Phoenix is always missing something that urban cities have . . . character, taste, and uniqueness. 

Don't get me wrong, we need more healthy food markets that are independently owned but Luci's standard for food and selection of what they sell is an extreme disappointment and even an embarrassment."}
{"text":"I drive by Luci's so much and I finally got to try it last week. I wish I had popped into here sooner! Luci's is all things fresh with a tad of 'just in case' .. that would be the beer and wine in the cooler that they offer, or all the cool gifts, gadgets and even chocolates and candy to browse or buy in the marketplace that is sort of housed around the seating. The concept is simple. You order at the counter, grab your table with your number and they deliver your order a short while later. Luci's is hipster and cool and such a great place for a simple coffee or tea; freshly blended juice or smoothie;  a salad, sandwich, breakfast or like I said above, a  grab and sit beer or wine. The day that I was in, with my hiking mate, I somehow managed to beat the maniac lunch rush and got a high top table at the window. I ordered the ever fresh made to order, \" Chop Chop Cobb Salad, a light mix of spinach and seasonal squash, diced tomato, roasted turkey, applewood smoked bacon, red onion and marinated artichoke hearts. All topped with a home made bleu cheese pesto dressing. My daughter, ordered the Tuna Nicosia Salad. This salad was also fresh and yummy. It was made with fresh albacore tuna salad and served over mixed greens, with cucumber, tomato, a few green beans, a little hardboiled egg, red potato, red onion and olives and finished off with a light citrusy vinaigrette. Both of our salads were super filling and good! My salad was so loaded with bacon, I pulled some of it off! Luci's offers gluten free items on the menu, as well as ordering online, in case you are in a rush.. order before you go! I also noticed that Luci's serves breakfast all day and has a different special every day! Parking can be a mess here.. I will give that to where its located! So planning to dine here will take just that... some planning to beat the rush of morning or lunch. But albeit that, the service is happy, great and with a smile! The food is fresh, healthy and lovely. Since the food is so healthy, you can splurge on that other stuff!"}
{"text":"I truly admire Luci's concept. They carry a lot of unique products on their shelves. The staff is kind and welcoming. It's overall a bright, welcoming space for people to gather.

Unfortunately, I am consistently underwhelmed by what they serve. The hot coffee and cold brew tastes like a standard diner cup of coffee, which is perfectly palatable, but nothing to look forward to. Their breakfast food is satisfactory, but leaves very little to be memorable. Additionally, on multiple occasions there have been pieces of meat in their medley potatoes. As a self-proclaimed healthy marketplace, I would expect their cooks to be more aware of cross contamination of ingredients, especially since they accommodate many vegetarians and vegans.

Ultimately, come here for what they stand for, but not necessarily to be blown away."}
{"text":"Again, the haters grumble about trivial issues...

I walked to Luci's from my house and was parched when I arrived.  I grabbed a large cup of the BEST TEA OF MY LIFE.  It's a pomegranate citrus green tea and they sell it for 5.99 in the tea area.. Usually green teas are bitter or have a bitter bite, but this tea was excellent. I had 3 huge glasses.. By the time I got home I had to pee in the worst way.. hah!

OK, second thing. Ken the owner  was walking around talking to everyone and told us about the work they did to install new trusses in the building .. way cool.

As you walk in (facing the coffee station), check out the food in the fridge.. it's prepared fresh every morning and the intent is for people to grab on the way to work.. fresh home made food.. awesome.. 

We also met Ebenezer Williams, the chef responsible for the hominy and beet chicken salad we had.. man was that good.  We talked to Ebenezer for a while about his cooking and he said the reason he cooks is to see that look in peoples eyes when they taste something really great that they didn't expect.. well Ebenezer, zing; Hominy and Beets it is!

REALLY Cool Fact: they have a demo kitchen where they'll be doing cooking classes and other food related stuff.. right on! 

The only thing I'd like to see in addition to the cool stuff they're already doing is a weekend special like Omelet  Sundays or pancake Saturdays.. that would rock!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast burrito bomb, great turkey omelet, bottomless coffee, $3 wine/sangria/mimosas all day, and yummy pastries! Don't forget to join the loyalty program...it's nice getting $5 off now and again."}
{"text":"I met a coworker here for lunch and forgot how much I really enjoy this place.  I love the laid back vibe, amazing menu of fresh food, friendly staff and fun gifts to choose from.  This time I enjoyed the turkey burger with no bun and loved it - so flavorful and tasty.  The only negative is the lack of parking...make sure to get there early to secure a spot!"}
{"text":"LOVE Lucy's!! The  atmosphere is so relaxing, staff is so upbeat, happy, nice and welcoming! The food is AMAZING to say the least. I love going and just sitting down and enjoying a meal there no one every bothers me! Great place to bring a book and just read! The chop chop cobb salad is the best fyi!"}
{"text":"Great local place that offers coffee, tea, sandwiches, bagels, fresh local ingredients and that small business coffee shop vibe. They also have a marketplace offering health food, organics, wine, local items and kitschy items. Come in a few times and they'll remember your name and drink. The baristas are friendly and FAST. In the rush hours it can be jammed full but you can still grab your coffee, breakfast sandwich, and a fresh salad for lunch in under ten minutes. A fun place to hang out for lunch or breakfast. 

They are pricier than Circle K (obviously) but less than Starbucks with a much more pleasant environment. The parking is minimal directly in front of the shop so it can be a tight squeeze during heavy business hours."}
{"text":"Luci's tends to be my go-to place to when I have some take-home work or need a place to study.  They have free wi-fi and an atmosphere conducive to work, study, or even have a leisurely read.    

They have good coffee, great iced tea, and delicious pastries.  I am partial to the scones and brownies.  I have only ordered the turkey burger off the menu.  It has a Mediterranean flair, was garnished with red peppers and artichoke hearts, and complimented with a side of regular and sweet potato tater tots.  It was an excellent sandwich, especially when compared to many of the outstanding restaurants in the area. 

The service is what makes Luci's shine.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  A manager usually asks about your food and won't hesitate to refill your iced tea.  Notwithstanding, I did have one negative experience with the service.  They forgot to make a coffee that I ordered.  After complaining, they apologized, quickly made my drink, and even gave me a $5,00 gift card for the inconvenience.  To their credit, they went above and beyond, which is more than what most places would do.

Luci's also has a market attached to the restaurant/coffee shop.  They have a small but quality selection of wines, beers, cheeses, prepared foods, and a variety of other items.  

Luci's is a great place to study/work, grab a quick bite, or have a casual date.  You should definitely check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This is the best sandwich place in the valley by far. It has so many options to choose from, and is very veg. friendly. The market has many items that are hard to find in a regular grocery store. Also, try them lemonade. It is to die for!"}
{"text":"Love luci's! Everything is yummy! Love that I can get a salad in the grab and go:) breakfast is also good. Killer pancakes:)"}
{"text":"I love the food I get delivered from here. I use UberEats to deliver to my home and work. Yesterday, I ordered enough food to last me an entire weekend and the food tasted just as good the next day as it did the first. I have yet to visit this restaurant and dine in, but one day I will. I would recommend this place to anyone who likes tasty healthy food."}
{"text":"A place like Luci's is definitely needed in this location. I like their selection of products they have for sale (Weleda, Seventh generation, beer, cold drinks,  ice cream, etc) just anything I would usually get from Whole Foods or Sprouts, just without the drive. The store has a good feel to it. So why 3 stars? The pastries... I wonder why they didn't change the supplier in a long time. Today was the last time I gave them a try. No more. Coffee.... It  takes them too long to make a cup. If I am in hurry I just go across the street to Starbucks. I will not practice the virtue of patience, while waiting for my coffee, only to be nice."}
{"text":"Gourmet pickles and breakfast. Two tings I don't have rarely but I found both here.

I had a basic veggie omelet with potatoes and some fruit. Even as a split plate is was a good size and made for an affordable $4.50 each ($9ish total)

The eggs were as expected, I was surprised by the meddely of potatoes including purple ones, it was good and unusual. The fruit was nothing too special. What made the meal great was a decent selection of small label hot sauces.

In the market they had some nice gourmet pickles, something I had been looking for some time. 

My one complaint is that the meals and other things seem to be about 20% higher priced then I would like to see."}
{"text":"I just learned the meaning \"I've died and gone to haven\" after having the daily Luci's breakfast at 2:30pm:) the amount of vegetables they put in the omelet were amazing as well as the fresh taste of the ingredients. I've struggled with finding a breakfast place that uses fresh Ingredients and actually puts a good amount of vegetables as advertised! I just can't believe  I haven't tried this place before but rest a sure I have found my new breakfast joint"}
{"text":"Love the funny merchandise!! But I ordered a coffee and people were all served but me. So I'm waiting finally the cashier ask if I need anything. ( uhmm yes I just gave you money for an americano ) she acted like it was the end of the world to make my espresso and water with ice. Rude!"}
{"text":"An excerpt from a letter to Slade Grove, Wicked Kitchen Confections:

\"Luci's was the perfect spot to feature your confections. The service was amazing. My latte had a little heart in foam on the top. The service people were so friendly, but I feel like they should know more about what a big deal you are :) I had to educate them! I could put together a powerpoint if you'd like (kidding).
The place was neat and tidy but had a nice warm quality to it. They had the convertible doors open so the breeze was really fitting for a late morning pastry-brunch.\"

A friend and I skipped the gym and went over to Luci's to celebrate my birthday and the Wicked pastries now being featured. We split a cinnamon roll and a red velvelt mini-cake (because according to Slade cupcake are out of fashion). The atmosphere was clean but cozy, the coffee was delicious and served with a smile. As far as the pastries... it's Slade. You can't go wrong.
Luci, the owner, was outgoing and interested in our opinions of the place.
Overall, it was a lovely experience. I hope to return soon for an actual meal or maybe to take a cooking lesson."}
{"text":"Really enjoy Luci's.  Had the Spaniard Omelette which was good. The chicken chorizo, which you don't see very often, was really nice.  Could have had just a little more spice/bite to it but was good nonetheless.  My friend Burrito Bomb which is her usually and which she lives.  Coffee refills are free which is really nice.  Great vibe and ambience. Perfect place for a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place 6+ years now and love the friendly service and consistently delicious food. Sandwiches, pasta salad, lavosh, and desserts are all wonderful. Atmosphere is upbeat yet warm and cozy. Also offers lots of unique and fun gifts as well as some interesting grocery items. Parking can be a bear when it's busy."}
{"text":"There is so much I could say about this place, and there would still be so much left to say. I really love it. Great service, great atmosphere, and a great selection of food and groceries. 

They have a huge menu and serve breakfast all day long, and a decent drink list. I get the Chai tea latte, and its delicious. They also have fresh pastries to go along with your meal or drink. 

It's local places like this that gives a community its own flavor. It's certainly a spot that I have come to love hanging out and getting a bit to eat or picking up a treat before heading home. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, that Luci's is a welcome edition to the neighborhood.  It's so nice to drive down the street and see the big glass garage doors open, with people drinking coffee in the morning, and enjoying  live music in the evenings. Their staff is great, and the owners seem very kind as well.

I gotta say that I haven't tried anything freshly made at Luci's that blew me away, EXCEPT the blueberry sour cream muffin.  Holy Cow, it's delicious!  Luci's also has descent coffee, which I will always choose over the Starbucks across the street. I'm slightly addicted to their bottomless helpings of iced pomegranate green tea, which is a proprietary blend just for them.

Luci's is a great alternative to the somewhat shady liquor stores and aging Basha's along 16th street to get a nice bottle of wine and/or an interesting microbrew.  You can also purchase a single beer, if you just need a single cold one after a long day.

I give it 3 stars b/c the \"healthy marketplace\" offerings are uninspired and overpriced. As I mentioned I haven't had anything there that knocks my socks off.  I just think that the standards need to be higher with respect to simple food that awakens your taste buds.  There's a lot of potential there, and I just want them to go for it!"}
{"text":"A friend has recommended this place. I had breakfast, buckwheat pancakes with blueberry and turkey chorizo. The pancakes tasted like whatever meat was cooked on the gridle prior to my pancakes. I had to drown the taste with syrup. Then, the turkey chorizo was ground white turkey meat, which was good, but it was seasoned with what tasted like taco seasoning. I could have saved $18 and cooked my own breakfast at home."}
{"text":"I am smiling as I walk in and walk out , so you know this has got to be a good place.   The vibe as my oldest and I walk in is \"good morning \", lots of happy Barristas  serving up  big globs of happy. We were hungry and not quite awake but quickly after eyeing the menu and the sunshine vibe , we got our happy on and we too were ready for the day. Love the bright retro  mood as you walk in complete with Upbeat old school music 
( Abba, Issac Hayes and the theme from Happy Days, I am not joking ) 
I had a tall cooling caffeine laden glass of pomegranate, green tea that made me smile, along with a nice made to order pile of eggs and fruit . The taste was filling and just what I wanted ..that's I went with the made to order eggs.    Jessica had the egg burrito that looked so big I was afraid for her. It was tasty and actually way too much food.  Mmmmmmyummmy.    
Clean , Neat well organized, and a little health food mini mart to boot. Wish  I lived close enough to make this place my go to local market...
I will be back with Mom in tow ..and next time I am getting a wicked pastry ....thanks Luci."}
{"text":"Expensive! Worth every penny though. This place makes high quality, healthy food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The staff are always high energy, smiling and very helpful which helps make the atmosphere extremely positive and inviting. This place i"}
{"text":"On my way to lunch in the same plaza, I spotted Luci's - a place I'd been hearing about lately.  I decided I would stop in after lunch, and did just that.

What a cute place!  I love the decor and love that there seem to be lots of treasures to be found in the market area.  Since I didn't do more than take a cursory glance as I walked in, this review will be for the coffeeshop/bakery only.

First... the good.

1. The two women behind the counter were both very friendly and helpful, which counts for a lot at any place I visit.

2. The display case of baked good was stocked with lots of really beautiful pastries.  I found myself wanting a small bite of everything!

3. Even though it wasn't on the menu, I was able to order a cafe au lait - my current obsession.

4. Seating was plentiful and comfortable.

And the not-so-good...

1. The strawberry cupcake, while beautiful and dusted with really pretty edible shimmer of some sort, was dry, crumbly, and not very good.  The icing tasted great but left a very strange film in my mouth - sort of waxy, oily, greasy consistency.

2. I've been advised that it is not out of the norm for a coffeeshop to hand you your cup of heated milk/foam/etc. for you to fill on your own with coffee from carafes (not so with espresso-based drinks), but I'm really bothered by this practice for some reason.  Luci's is the second place in Phoenix I've visited who does this.  Maybe I'm just being fussy about it, but I think if I'm going to pay $4 for some steamed milk and coffee, the least you can do is top it off with coffee for me.

3. When I'm paying $4 to pour my own coffee, I expect the last 1/4 of the cup will not be filled with coffee grounds.  This happened to me today (not until I got back to the office, of course) and I was very displeased about it.

Luci's is a nice little place, the employees are very friendly, and the coffee (sans grounds) was actually pretty good.  I can see it being a nice place to read, people-watch, or even do some work, so it does have a lot going for it.  I'm not sure I'll ever go out of my way to visit, but if I'm in the area and it comes down to choosing Luci's over Starbucks (which is just across the street), Luci's will win any day."}
{"text":"Its one of the cutest places in town.  Buy some groceries (the location is convenient and selection is small, but interesting, pricing is normal for a boutique grocery). 

I had a muffin there once that was decent.  I sometimes will stop and get two pieces of cake to go.  

I ate food there twice, once was when they first opened, so I'll not write about that, as I'm sure they were working out hiccups. the second time was breakfast.  I just had that muffin, but my boyfriend had a breakfast burrito. the potatoes were undercooked and it was just a mass of scrambled eggs with little flavor.  he won't eat there again, so it'll be a while before I try to eat there again. 

I hope the quality of the food improves, as I really like having cool places to eat near the house. I gave them an extra star for being in my hood."}
{"text":"I got the build your own omelet with all the  veggies and a side of potatoes. It was delicious! There were tons of veggies and everything tastes very fresh. I got an Americano with cream that was pretty good. Not as good as fame or lux but better than Starbucks. I liked that it was counter service because it felt more casual. This place can get very busy though and it can be hard to find a table. I would suggest going earlier in the morning or on a weekday. We ended up getting a table but felt a bit crowded. I love that this place has specialty groceries too. They have tons of cute knick knacks and everything you could need for your gluten free, paleo, non gmo, baking needs. Overall, super cute place with delicious food!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LUCI'S!!!!!!!!!!! I stop here every morning for coffee and the occasional breakfast to go. The staff is amazing and friendly and the food is healthy and delicious. Now there is a 2nd location and I hope to see a chain in the future!!!!"}
{"text":"This super cute little restaurant/shop has great food and friendly service in a casual atmosphere. It's a favorite, especially after hiking Squaw Peak. 

We've been here many, many times for breakfast - the pastries are yummy, the food is interesting and well-executed (the chef's special is always excellent), and the shop is fun to browse (a little spendy for actual buying, but great novelty items). 

The pancakes are yummy, the crabby pants omelet is fabulous, and don't miss the breakfast potatoes! This past weekend, the Chef's special was a phenomenal Chilaquiles (we got a vegetarian version) - the roasted corn with chile lime butter was fantastic and the chef actually came out to see how we liked it (super nice guy!).

Overall, it's always a great experience eating at Luci's!"}
{"text":"The 2 rating is not for the food which is delicious or the service which is great. The 2 rating is for the hostess manager who is very nice and pleasant to the customers. Thank you for being great. However, as I was sitting at the cook's bar it was painful to watch her hover over the cook's and clearly make them uncomfortable with demanding food from them quickly. It made me uncomfortable as well. These guys are working their butts off to provide delicious meal and the hostess manager is micromanaging their efforts. I would rather wait for my food to be prepared correctly than to have it rushed. My friend and I told the cooks they were doing an excellent job and thanked them for the delicious breakfast. We thought they needed to hear that."}
{"text":"I didn't think the food was great. The staff wasn't awesome either they kind of had the vibe like \"hey I'm better than you\" and my friend asked for a side of salsa and never even came back. 

It's SOOOOOOOO overpriced for this shit."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan! Live in the neighborhood and appreciate the atmosphere, the food and the coffee. Great meeting spot for friends or casual business meetings. The staff are always friendly and upbeat."}
{"text":"I was so thrilled when the BF took me here for breakfast today. It is so rare that we get to enjoy a morning together with our hectic lives. The menu looked delicious- and the Eggs Benedict special that my BF ordered was great. In no way, would I consider it \"healthy\" though... lol! Loaded in delicious fat... The employees were polite as well- even though the place was packed.

I ordered the kale salad... This is where things went very down hill... it was covered in oil. No dressing, but olive oil. There was so much oil on the salad that it pooled on the plate. I rarely send anything back, but it was inedible. 

They took it back and brought me out a new plate that almost looked like the same exact salad...  I ate about half of the salad- again oil pooled on the plate, but my mouth was so coated with olive oil, I was starting to feel sick. I could feel it on my lips, my chin... absolutely DISGUSTING!

Since this is what they gave us after I already sent it back for too much oil... I didn't want to complain again. I really dislike having to do that, especially since the place was very busy.

I ended up using about 27 napkins... I am NOT exaggerating.  I used about 27 napkins to ring out the kale, so that the dish would be edible. We had a huge pile of oil soaked napkins all over our table. My hands were also soaked with oil... It was ridiculous. Even the people sitting at the table next to us were shocked by the amount of oil... it was really awful. Even after using 27 napkins to soak up some of the oil... the rest was still very oily... it was just a little more tolerable. Although the employees were very polite here, they did see what was happening with the salad, but never offered to fix the plate again- and made sure not to ask how our meal was when we purchased a few miscellaneous items before departing. 

We spent about $50-60 there this morning, between food and trinkets... I'm really disappointed that such a highly regarded establishment messed up so epic on something as simple as a salad.

Additionally, I ordered that salad as I have been trying to eat healthier, but since there was definitely more than 4 tablespoons of olive oil on the salad... that salad ended up being over 600 calories... which is such a bummer.  For that amount of calories and fat, I would have rather had the eggs benedict or something a heck of a lot tastier than a kale salad. I should have just not eaten it, but I wanted to enjoy the rare breakfast out with the BF. 

I don't think we will come here again because of this experience."}
{"text":"I've gotten my daily grind @ a national chain coffee shop on 16th st & Bethany home rd for quite som time until wandering into Luci's Healthy Marketplace on the opposite corner. Talk about day vs. night!! Luci's harks back to the days of the neighborhood market/coffee house where the propriator and employees not only know your name but how you like your morning Joe! I find that the people working here genuinely ENJOY doing so and are eager to give their customers the kind of experience that is all too often missing in todays frenetic world. I had been meaning to try something from their dinner menu and recently had the opportunity. The home made chicken pot pie sounded like just the thing to brighten up a rainy day so I ordered up one and had a seat at the counter in front of the chef. It isnt often that you get to sit and watch your food prepared to order before your eyes but here I was, comfortably enjoying a conversation with a few other patrons and chatting with the chef while he prepared my meal. The pot pie comes in a HUGE tin which lends itself to transport home, filled with a thick, hearty broth LOADED with fresh perfectly prepared vegetables and plump, juicy chicken. Gently placed atop of the filling is a lite, flaky puff pastry shell which gives the pie the perfect amount of texture and crunch. I REALLY hoped this pie tasted as good as it looked and soon enough I was able ta put spoon to meal and enjoy my first bite...the verdict...it was DELICIOUS!!!! that this is probably the BEST pot pie i've EVER had from the most unlikely of locations is a testament to the involvement of the owners, Ken & Luci Schnitzer who can be found daily making their customers feel like welcomed family. I HIGHLY recommend dropping in to have a meal, a superbly prepared coffee drink or some of their ADDICTIVE house iced tea...a Mediterranean pomagranite citrus green tee."}
{"text":"People here weren't really friendly. I didn't feel welcomed at all. I really hate it because they had some dope little gifts there. /:"}
{"text":"I have had both good and bad experiences here. The staff are friendly and happy, and their coffee bar delicious. But I can't get over waiting almost an hour while watching people come in and out, on a sidewalk table, cooking in the sun, because the person running the takeouts didn't check the entire restaurant before deciding to abandon finding me. This is despite the fact I was directly outside the front door and glass windows with my table number prominently displayed on the table flag. I finally left my dog, unattended on the sidewalk to go in and find out what happened to be told, \"oh we were looking for you!\" In an almost accusatory tone. I pointed directly through the window to my frantic dog. They asked if I had my number, and I again pointed to the window. I reminded them it had been over 45 minutes since I placed my order. They were unapologetic and even suggestive that it was my fault  because they couldn't find me. I was directly out front and prominently visible!! They wanted me to wait for the manager to decide he was free to talk to me, to which I informed them I could not because my dog was unattended, hot, and without water -I truly did not expect my 8:30 am Saturday breakfast take out run would have me outside in the heat for that long. I got home, a mile away, and the omelet did not look appealing after that long containment in the plastic, and my coffee was no longer hot. I think what left my the most upset (I get it, mistakes can happen) is there was a sense of such a lack of ownership for their mess up to not thoroughly check for their waiting customers. All I wanted was an acknowledgment and apology...."}
{"text":"I live down the street from Luci's and sadly for me, I won't be visiting them any longer. First, they're slow and they are pricey.  I paid $10 for a dragon fruit bowl-- it was served in a cute, shallow wood bowl but the strawberries and kiwi that topped the bowl were gross! The strawberries were too soft and the kiwi was hard and SOUR, which was even worse because they gave me a lot of it (which would be great if they had better produce) A few days later I decided to try again and  came in and order 2 to go, substituting bananas and blueberries instead of the strawberries and kiwi.  We also paid $2 for extra granola ($1 each) since there wasn't much on the previous bowl. After waiting for 15+ minutes for my smoothie bowls, they arrived and they were in a much SMALLER container than the other day when I ordered it to eat in the restaurant.  Also, there were 4 banana slices and 2 blueberries on both of the smoothies, WHAT?? our \"extra\" granola that we paid for never showed, there was a tablespoon AT MOST.  We called and complained about this because it was so expensive (about $22 after tax) and we were told by a manager, Elizabeth, that they would leave a gift card up at the front for us the next time that we came in.  Within a few days I called in an order for another 2 smoothie bowls, again substituting in bananas and blueberries and extra granola.  After my arrival they said there was no such gift card but they could give me $2 off order to pay for my extra granola that I didn't receive the previous time... At that point I didn't feel like arguing so I took the offer. When my smoothie bowls arrived the fruit was in the bottom, they were hardly over  3\4 of the way through and the 2nd smoothie bowl and hardly any grandola and zero fruit. 

I may ususally be more forgiving because they live so close to me, but I don't look forward to getting ripped off again. Luci's has been a waste of my money and a waste of my time. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I love the idea of Luci's and I've had some great experiences here. The staff is always friendly and the lattes are great. I haven't tried the food yet but that's definitely next on my list. Unfortunately they are pretty overpriced and their iced coffee is just not my cup of tea. This morning I paid almost $8 for a small iced coffee (which I wasn't a fan of) and a decent but a little dry muffin. I would give them 3.5 stars if that was an option."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in here during a workday for lunch since it's right down the street from my office. The weather was nice out so they had the wall of doors open by the seating area inside. The menu had a variety of items to fit anyone's cravings. I decided to go with the soup of the day (tomato w/cilantro) and a side house salad with homemade pesto, blue cheese dressing. Both were fantastic! Cute little spot for grabbing coffee, breakfast or lunch. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My new place for wi-fi and iced coffee. Breakfast is great also. Good service, easy location. On my good list. When you are done with coffee, don't forget to pick up a few healthy things for later."}
{"text":"Made it to Luci's after 3 years, was not impressed the first time I went when they first opened but they have stepped up their game. 

NOW: with their leaning towards healthy goods and good for you foods, there were NO vegan options in pastries. strange..but lots of gluten free, GF does not make a vegan happy. Perhaps consult with a vegan? 

My latte was great, almond milk vanilla latte. love that they have these options! 

I was SHOCKED and amazed to look at their dinner menu and see that they served veal. As we all know, Veal is baby cows taken from their mothers at birth and locked in a box for 6-10 weeks and then slaughtered. This is promoting animal violence and cruelty and I cannot support a business that does this.

I think Luci's is confused about their identity, here is healthy food (some of the best brands are here in their store) and then there is VEAL, no they don't cancel each other out and you can't make everyone happy Luci's. Pick an identity and go with it. Until I hear differently about the cruelty you choose to condone, you have lost my support."}
{"text":"The salads were delicious. The kids enjoyed their flap jacks. And I highly recommend the chocolate dipped coconut macaroon!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, really good lemonade and service was okay... No one asked us how we were doing but friendly food runner"}
{"text":"First off I love Luci, great place for coffee, love the atmosphere. Love meeting friends there. I have had breakfast there 3 x's  and all three times my omelette was pretty bad, they always seem to over cook the eggs, a brown scorched omelette.. The potatoes were parboiled, OK I can understand that, but at least brown the potato's a little   on the grill .. They looked like they we put on grill 30 seconds.. I cant be the only one who has had a bad omelette here and 3 times.. Maybe Cuz its a busy Saturday and Sunday.. I really would love to enjoy a omelette there..."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast/brunch or just to grab a drink! Friendly staff, fun atmosphere!  Plus a neat little grocery area and fun \"gifts with whimsy.\"  A little loud at meal times but mid afternoon better tea and more character than Starbucks!!"}
{"text":"Food is super yummy. A little pricey though, especially when you see the cashier poor orange juice out of the carton that was bought from a grocery store and charged like 3$ for it. I much would have rather seen the juice being  dispensed from a machine or poured in front of me   The breakfast and muffins are delish! 

I will say this, and I'm sure others can agree while dining there, TOO MANY FLY's. Each time I sit and eat, I'm disturbed by all the flys on my food. Maybe they can find a way to get them out of the eating area or use a fly trap to help with the problem. 

Overall, I will continue to come here because they have amazing pancakes and food is really good!"}
{"text":"Good coffee, good food, gluten free options for everything, great atmosphere (especially in off summer months). I really enjoy this place! It's a grocery store too and has a ton of great healthy options for food to take home. If I am ever in the area and can, I try to move all my business meetings and lunches to this place. I just like being there."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place after reading the reviews. However, finding parking for this place is a HORRIBLE experience. There's very few parking spots and this place is located on a busy intersection. Nevertheless, the atmosphere once you enter is wonderful. There's a cafe inside featuring a small organic and trendy market. The barista was very friendly. However, the vanilla latte was burnt and I've had better coffee elsewhere."}
{"text":"My review is actually on the meal service that Luci's provided for Thanksgiving.  The family had some issues to deal with over the holidays and the thought of creating a big meal was overwhelming so I shopped around and after much debate settled on Luci's for the meal.  I really can't describe how happy I was with my choice.

The food was AMAZING.  I've had pre-bought meals like this before, but this actually all tasted like something that came out of a kitchen with a cook that cared about what they were serving to their own guests.  Seasonings were pronounced, yet mild and the fresh herbs could be seen throughout.  There were options to select from and rather than getting piddly little portions, you received enough to actually feed a family.  The highlights of the meal were the mashed potatoes (seriously how they made these is still beyond me because they were SO light and fluffly), the green bean caserole that was better than anything coming out of that campbell's can, the seasonal salad that could be substituted for any side, and the turkey itself.

Every single person at the table raved about each component of the meal and the fact that it was made with locally sourced ingredients just makes it all the better.  To top everything off, they loaded everything into the car and the packaging was perfect for both transport as well as storage (because there were a ton of leftovers).

I will absolutely do this again and would recommend them to anyone looking to simplify while still holding on to traditions.  Call ahead because I was told that I literally got the last meal as they had not counted on them being so popular but don't call too far ahead becuase I might have to fight you for your turkey. :)"}
{"text":"Luci's is a nice little marketplace and cafe! I had been here a few times in the past but I think today was my first time actually ordering a meal from Luci's. The store itself is fun, a lot of cool gift/ novelty item type things to check out. The menu has quite a few tasty looking options on there! I usually don't go for sandwiches but I decided to try the naughty nurse and I enjoyed it! Everything on it tasted fresh and I liked the multigrain bread. I chose  berries as my side and some of them liked a tad funky, but mostly good. I also got a snickerdoodle cookie which was the star of the show. When I ordered it I couldn't tell if it was going to be hard or soft, but I got lucky and it was a delicious soft cookie, I thought it was excellent. I hope to come back to try the black bean burger!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick coffee or bite, but also a great place for breakfast.  The oatmeal here is almost as good as Taylor's Cafe but the omelettes are pretty tasty and come with a sweet potato hash that I wish more places would serve.  The good news is that if you are here just for coffee, the pastry case is better than at any Starbucks.  You can also wander around the store and get some other groceries.  (Its not the cheapest, think Whole Foods) but it does feel like a great neighborhood place.  Parking is not great though, so be forewarned, carpool if you can!"}
{"text":"Luci's what has happened to you? I ordered the special. I should have been worried when the cashier didn't know what the special was. After sorting that out we sat down to wait for our food the food runner came over to ask what kind of bread because they were out of English muffins. The special was supposed to be on a bagel. So I suggested a bagel would be fine. The food came and it was lackluster looking. My companion ordered the roast beef sandwich and it looked like a sandwich an 8 year old would make. There was very little meat and cheese and what was there looked like they scraped the bottom of the fridge for them. It was also missing the horseradish mayo. My \"special\" was anything but. The bagel the sandwich was made with was cold while the rest of the ingredients were warm. It also tasted stale and old. The sandwich was also missing the Swiss cheese. This experience saddened me. I used to love the quality of food at Luci's and it has slipped so much that I downloaded the yelp app and wrote this review in hopes that they will take notice and do better."}
{"text":"Our home away from home. 

Great food, SENSATIONAL staff, and a fun, casual atmosphere that is conducive for getting some work on the laptop done. 

The Spaniard Omelette is great, and the iced Green Tea is legit. 

There is a small, eclectic \"market\" inside which is fun. Think \"Joot N' Hoops\" and healthy food, you get the idea. 

We have also hosted events with 10+ people her and it has been fun. They also do cooking classes during the week which is very cool as well. Just a great vibe with great people."}
{"text":"We were craving a Sunday morning latte so we started driving towards  Starbucks on Bethany Home and 16th st when we saw Luci's kitty corner across the street. It looked so cute with the garage door open and looked full of activity. They had a little farmers market in front with fresh produce from a local farm being sold. 

I had a soy latte , my husband had a vanilla latte and we split the egg sammie. The lattes were really good and I agree the corrugated cups are way better than those \"sleeves\" you get at other coffee places. The egg sammie was really big, it looked more like an omelet squished between a bagel. 

The total for everything was $14 which seemed a little high but you can tell everything was made with quality ingredients so the price is worth it. The lunch menu sounds great and consists of mostly sandwiches and salads. This is a fun place to meet with friends or just stop in for a good cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Quaint & funky, I enjoy coming into Luci's from time to time.  I actually live within walking distance, & could come more often, but I find them to be a little pricey.  I've had breakfast, lunch, and dinner there & so far my fave (by far) has been the lunch.  Their roast beef sammie was fab!!  Sadly, you can't order from their lunch menu after 5p.  Recently I had their pasta plus protein.  Same as with the breakfast omlettes, you can upgrade your basic selection a little at a time.  So, start with pasta & your choice of sauce.  Next level would be to add veggies ( a choice of about 5 or so), and from their, you can upgrade to adding protein - choice of chicken or shrimp - while still having veggies.  Like the concept and a HUGE portion, but the pasta had a funky texture.  Maybe I got gluten free by mistake.  You can stop in here for a quick treat or to pick up some healthy alternatives, but it's not a regular pick of mine.

OH!  I almost forgot the cooking classes!  What a fantastic idea and I love that they are offered by category.  I can't wait until the \"Knife Skills\" class comes back.  I've always wanted to chop & dice like a pro!"}
{"text":"I was going between four and five stars so I think 4.5 stars is accurate. I went just this morning with my boyfriend before he caught his flight to Iceland (seriously I'm jealous but one of us has to work!) The place is super cute and trendy which is on par for the neighborhood. But the latte I had this morning was one of the best I've ever had it was not too sweet and not bitter at all. I was fighting my boyfriend over it as he was going to wait to get one until we left but then he tried mine and wanted it! I hope Iceland has great coffee babe! We also got the Egg Sammy with scrambled egg, provolone, bacon on a bagel, and the Crazy Monkey French Toast. The Sammy was delicious and had the perfect amount of melted cheese. I love the French toast but my boyfriend was not as thrilled with it but hear me out. It's true it was almost lukewarm instead of hot and my boyfriend said it seemed like it was reheated. While that might be true I personally like my food at a more room temperature, probably so I can eat it a lot faster because I'm a fat kid at heart- so for me it was perfect! The bread was also very dense and I like that it had a lot of texture to it. Unfortunately I moved out of the area about a year ago but I look forward to making this another regular spot for me again! Be sure to check out the shop as they have tons of unique silly items!"}
{"text":"I appreciate what Luci's is going with their store. It's cool, the food is good, and their little store selection is intriguing. Sure it's crowded but who can blame a place for being popular? Not this Yelper.

That said, my verdict has always been out on Luci's. Not that it really matters because the place has like 300 reviews so its rating isn't going anywhere, but every visit I've had is just somewhat imperfect. Nothing big to scream about -- but small mistakes here and there. 

For example, yesterday we ordered our breakfasts plus 1 small and 1 medium coffee. The cashier rings it up then says, \"We're currently out of small cups so they'll both be in mediums.\" So when our name is called and we grab the coffees, there are two medium cups but one is just partially full. Like, seriously, what is that? You're really going to skimp on the few ounces of DRIP COFFEE? Who does that? How do you even know you gave us the volume of a small and didn't short us? I get that she said they'd both be in medium cups but, man, talk about seeming cheap!

So that's the kind of stuff that just eats away at me, visit after visit. I want to love Luci's the way so many others do but they JUST won't let me. It's hard when it's always SOMETHING and, I don't know, I think maybe I'll just have to accept that Luci's just isn't for me."}
{"text":"Such a big fan the family and I ate her 3 mornings while on our Spring Break.  The kids loved the kid pancakes, fresh fruit and yummy potatoes.  Lots of variety to choose from for adults too.  From omelets to bagel sandwiches, this place hit the spot.  Great baristas and specialties to choose from iced coffee, hot coffee and lattes.  We will be back on our next trip!"}
{"text":"I was a bit torn on Lucy's. They're local and have made great use of their space so add a star.

The serve up a decent cup of coffee and their treats from the coffee bar so add another star.

I haven't had anything else on their menu but everything looks good so watch this space for another star.

I'm less than impressed by the actual market part. Their shelves are stocked but I can never see myself coming here for groceries. Minus a star  :(

All that said, I was desperate on the Friday before Christmas as I needed fresh basil. I managed to score the last package at Sprouts but I then proceed to dash all over the Biltmore area in search for the second package. No luck at Safeway, Fry's or Basha's. On a whim I popped into Luci's and scored the fresher looking of two packages of basil that looked sadly beyond their shelf lives. At this point though, I had no choice.

The young guy who rang me up noticed the sorry state of my basil and after determining the poor quality of the other package proceeded to go into the store room and return with another package of FRESH fresh basil. OUTSTANDING service and attention to detail that would have been overlooked anywhere else. ADD 2 STARS for being exceptional!

I still don't think that all of my grocery needs will be met here and I don't think that that is their goal. But I appreciate exceptional service like I received here so I plan to purchase what I can here. If nothing else, it's a perfect time to go back and sample their menu.

Well done Luci's!"}
{"text":"Best place in the valley to get a coffee. If you like LGO you'll love this place. Same principal without the crowds and stress that LGO has. You can actually relax here and hear yourself think. I had their Breakfast Burrito this last Sunday and I can say with out a doubt that it was the best Breakfast Burrito I have ever had, and I know my Breakfast Burritos. Another great idea, and this goes for any coffee shop, other than Starbucks because they don't have it, use Almond Milk in your Mocha instead of regular or non-fat. It is amazing. My next plan is to try their cooking classes."}
{"text":"Luci's is my go-to place for networking with other professionals over coffee. The staff is sweet, the coffee is good, and the hot chocolate is awesome. I feel very well taken care of when I'm here. The food is quite good too and they have many options for  people with gluten sensitivities. The only problem I have with Luci's is the tables are spaced too close together."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. The burrito bomb breackfast burro is amazing. Pancakes are to good to miss. Sandwichs and pizza are very good.  Service is Great.  Parking could be better."}
{"text":"If there is one thing Phoenix does really really well, it's breakfast, and this place has phenomenal breakfast. I knew I was in for a treat cause the line was out the door when I arrived. I ordered the \"Moe\", which was an egg omelette with veggies inside, with a side of very delicious turkey sausage, with swiss cheese on top, and a cup of fruit. It hit the spot to say least. They have a regular market, coffee shop, and trinket shop too, so it's a very welcoming place to just hang out at if you want. Will be coming back again for sure. I think they have vegetarian cooking classes too. Maybe I should sign up"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here.  We had the Big Boy Breakfast and the Egg Sammie.  Both are very tasty!  Coffee is delicious....recommend the dirty chia for a change of pace.  Will be back to try the lunch menu."}
{"text":"I stopped by here on my way home a few Friday's ago.  I have to say they have a good selection of vegan, frozen organic and other natural type of foods.  

The main attraction however is the coffee/juice bar.  I had a delicious berry smoothy and was quite pleased with it.  The food is also really good.  The atmosphere is typical of a coffee shop.  I think that I was the only person in the place without a laptop.  There is a television on the back wall that serves no purpose (why I bring this up?  I wonder why it is there in the first place..........)

I recommend it.  Neat decor and a place to get a way for a quick snack or coffee."}
{"text":"Review Update:  

Just as I expected... a credit has been issued to my bank in the incorrect amount! 

Owed: $20.59 
Pending Credit: $14.10

I suppose they expect me to track down the Uber driver to refund the initial delivery fee! 

Luci's Healthy Marketplace if you're so hard up for cash, I suggest you consider Chapter 11."}
{"text":"So, it took awhile, but I finally made my way into Luci's recently... I was driving southbound on 16th street and made a spontaneous decision to stop by.  I'd done this once before, but it was when they were closed due to the fire at nearby Richardson's.  But, they are re-opened now, and they are still on fire... (this time just metaphorically speaking).

I ordered an iced tea at the coffee bar and browsed around a bit.  I bumped into Ken, the owner, who gave me a bit of history and a tour of this adorable boutique-ish neighborhood grocer.  I learned that they revamped their staff from their initial opening, including hiring Chef Eric Guerin, and while I didn't eat while I was there, I will for sure be back to do so soon... the menu looks great; especially their omelet selection!  

I could've spent hours looking around - they carry a variety of unique health food, vitamins, and eco-freindly natural products.  I ended up purchasing some vitamins (thanks Lucia for your help with that) and a citrus smelling Weleda brand natural deodorant (I hear so many bad things about regular deodorant, so I am going to give this stuff a shot).

My next visit to Luci's will be sooner than later for sure...  I can tell, I'd be a regular if it was a tad bit closer to home."}
{"text":"I love that I can get a hemp milk late here! The only downside is that the last time I was here it was getting to be pretty hot outside yet they insisted on keeping the large windows/doors open so it became a little difficult to drink my late while having to wave away pesky flies."}
{"text":"I am not sure how this place has a four-star rating.  We went there for dinner and we were one of only four tables.  It took 20 minutes for one person's food to arrive and then another five minutes for the second person's food to arrive.  Once our food arrived, it was barely edible.  My tater tots were frozen on the inside and my tuna melt bread was not grilled, it was soggy, and the tuna in the sandwich was cold.  Yuk."}
{"text":"I work across the street so I find myself in here for breakfast a lot. They do breakfast all day and its phenomenal."}
{"text":"I stopped into this market yesterday because it was on my way to work. Well worth the stop! As I walked through the doors I was instantly greeted by 3 or 4 staff members. I made my way over to the coffee/smoothie bar and was very impressed with the selection! I had a fruit smoothie with berries and it was fantastic! Not only was it delicious, but the marketplace had very corky and fun little gifts! I will definitely be back! Great job Lucis!"}
{"text":"Great place, I pass by here every Wednesday going to Hobe Meats and I finally decided to stop in here. Customer service is beyond a 5 star rating, I was just shopping for christmas presents and they acted like I've been going there for years. I didn't have time to seat and eat but I did grab a cupcake and scone on my way out. My dad enjoyed his cupcake, he's not big on sugar so it was perfect and the scone was delicious, not over powering in sugar so it was a nice treat:)"}
{"text":"After finding ourselves lost in a dry riverbed along the freeway, David and I decided to give in and call our early morning hike a done deal.  Our planned destination was Piestewa Peak but we were off course, so way off course.  After running around aimlessly for a bit, posing for pics and climbing a small hill we headed to Luci's for breakfast. We were really looking forward to it as it was a first visit for the both of us. The space is really cool, interesting products, great layout, a cool diner counter and super friendly staff. All that being said, my meal (egg Sammy on asiago bagel) was average and fell just a tad short of my expectations considering the anticipation and how great it read on the menu.  On a brighter side, David was thrilled with his \"special request\" latte. Evidently there are restrictions on allowable ounces on coffee products sold. He had his heart set on a super size big gulp version of a latte and the staff being super accommodating allowed for this \"one time\" exception and in my eyes a redeeming point lost on my Sammy.  Luci, for this I grant you back the lost point and a promise to return in the near future.  Thank you."}
{"text":"How have I not been here before? Such a fun place to hang out and grab a drink and GF pastry with your friends. Great lunch salads. And GF double chocolate muffin ! 
Try it, you won't regret it! 
They also have a little store in the back to look around while your food is being prepared."}
{"text":"I love breakfast foods, problem is my butt does not get out of bed that early on weekends.  LOL!  They only had 1 register working and that line was getting a little long.  The menus were not available to review until you walk up in line.  Then you can see the on the electronic boards.  I got the EGG SAMMIE with turkey. It was ok.  Pretty bland.  I wanted to get the french toast but no one wanted to share with me...  BUMMER!  Finding a seat, that was NOT fun.  Got a table all the way in the back by the beer."}
{"text":"We wanted to grab a quick bite after a jewelry making class we took in the same shopping center.  It was almost 8 and apparently the kitchen was about to close so the first thing I ordered wasn't available so I went with the veggie burger.  It was the frozen chipotle Gardenburger from Costco, but it hit the spot.  Had the pasta salad on the side which was quite good.  Really cute little market though.  Had a chance to browse and saw a lot of interesting items for sale.  I'm not in the area too often, but if I worked close by or something this would probably be a spot I would grab take out from on a regular basis."}
{"text":"This place stinks for 2 reasons. Food is too pricey & THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE COUNTER DON'T SHUT THEIR YAPPERS LONG ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY HEAR YOUR ORDER. Then you have to repeat it two more times which is annoying for me & everyone else behind me. Please stop the shiny happy people routine and let me have my coffee."}
{"text":"All I can say is, I wish it were my neighborhood store.

An Alta Dena lactose product, a BST sandwich [bacon spinach and tomato], and beet chips crackling beside me ..."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE! They have the best smoothies and lattes. I could come here everyday for hours and just take all of its super cute atmosphere in. All of the nicknacks in here are adorable!"}
{"text":"I love Luci's! It's such a unique spot, I love that there is a store in the restaurant. The store carries all kinds of healthy food items as well as some random nicknacks. This place is great for coffee, breakfast, or to grab a light lunch or dinner (lots of great salads and sandwiches)."}
{"text":"Went to Luci's this morning for cappuccino and a light breakfast. Was super impressed with the friendly service. From the minute we walked in and were greeted from behind the counter to the person who cleared our table...it was great!  More than what you would normally receive or expect from a counter service coffee spot.

The coffee and special breakfast sandwich were quite good. Loved all of the fun gifty items in the store to browse and the seating was comfy and casual. A good start to the first morning of our vacation!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food that is health conscious and tastes great. Had the wild salmon sandwich, honestly one of the better sandwiches I have had with fish in the phoenix area."}
{"text":"I happened on this cute little grocery store/ cafe while on the way to find something else. Basically it's a smaller Whole Foods but with a more unique twist."}
{"text":"Welllll, I had BIG expectations from this place! First off, any place with HEALTHY in their name is pretty much screaming at me to stop in. I had added Luci's Healthy Marketplace to my Instagram a while back, not sure how. Probably stumbled upon a picture of something that looked extremely tasty, followed by the name \"healthy\" and I'm there!!! So my first impression...I was handed my take out bag with clear, finger marks of grease on the outside, (which I will be posting a picture of!) Having taken a few nutrition classes, the term \"vegetarian\" \"vegan\" etc does NOT necessarily make it healthy! I understand organic and fresh local produce and can definitely appreciate that in my meal choice! I tasted just that in the vegetables although I was disappointed with what I ordered :/ I ordered the Veg Out Sammie. Usually, I see a long list of veggies and I'm all about it. Well that's basically what I ended up with. Raw veggies between 2 pieces of multigrain bread with a little bit of vegan mayo. No seasoning, spices, no sauce= NO FLAVOR! OK, I take that back...the roasted prepped was very flavorful! Haha, no skill for that! Just not impressed. When I'm paying about $10 for a sandwich i would expect something special about it. I have no limitation to my diet...not diabetic, no food allergies, not vegetarian. Therefore, I feel like I may as well have ordered something full of cheese and sauce and fat so there was flavor because I'm left completely dissatisfied! I enjoyed my dessert, a very, moist, salted dark chocolate caramel cookie (which came from an outsource!) So, what's for lunch?!"}
{"text":"Loved this place, the food, and the vibe. I haven't seen a shop like this in Phoenix so far. It's something between a micro whole foods, local coffeeshop, and a casual restaurant. I could see the most of the kitchen in the store. There are plenty of comfortable seats; friendly staff and the waiter makes it even cozier. I had a Wild Salmon sandwich with baked zucchini and really enjoyed it. It was both healthy and delicious. Luci's is now one of my favorite places in Phoenix and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I stopped because I wanted somthing cold and delicious. I saw Frappe Chai (way cool), it gave you the option of regular milk or soy.Which is fantastic since me and dairy aren't the best of friends. For some reason I like to read for myself the option than asking someone, so seeing that I knew thats what I wanted. Iced Chai into a Frappicino...and with Soy?! - YES Please!

I was greeted fairly quickly, I had the option of 20oz or 32oz. I controlled myself and got the 20oz, cost $4.33. The board said 5 bucks, but who am I to correct the employee when its in my favor?! LOL, I'm sure it was some type of happy hour though.

During the transaction, the cashier stopped to pass on a message to another employee, apoligezed and finished up. I'm noting this only becuase the employee she talked to, walked out to the customers who were sitting at the tables. Asking if they want a to go box, wiping down counters, basically asking them how it was going. Waitress duties but without the restaruant, pretty nice!

I walked around while waiting, they had so many cute things!! The magnets were pretty funny, at 5bucks I might pick up a few next time. They had these really cute headbands, I picked up and put right back down when I say the price - $9.99. To much...for a headband atleast!! I didn't go to far into the Market, but stayed around the souviner type section.

Well waiting I got annoyed because a woman who walked in a minute behind me got her iced drink first. When I walked back to the counter, the employees back was to me, telling her coworker she made this twice. Turned around, smiled and handed my drink over, \"Frappe Chai with SOY.\" Emphasis on the soy.
*Lightbulb*
She had to remake my drink because she used regular milk. Annoyance gone! Thank you for realizing the mistake and fixing it! Not passing it off as soy. My tummy thanks you to!"}
{"text":"The reason why I haven't tried this place up until now is because parking is horrendous! However, I wanted to try a new place to eat and get coffee so here I am! 

Hello, Luci! We walk in and we see the sign, \"coffee bar\" so I thought we just order coffee and order food somewhere else. However, the girl before us started ordering food so I'm looking everywhere for a menu - look to the right, there it is! I spend some time on the menu - it's pretty extensive. The fianc√© and I decide on splitting the huevos rancheros and I got an iced vanilla latte with almond milk. We wait for our drinks - get a number and have a seat. I love the layout, but it can get a little confusing.

The vanilla latte was ok - not my favorite. The huevos rancheros was also meh. After eating, we start browsing the aisles. I like it - I normally eat paleo so it's nice to have this place near me in case I need any ingredients. Their spices are half off! I got excited - call me spice crazy. I wanted to get them all, but I knew I had most of them already. 

Anywho, I'd probably come back. House wine bottles are $10 so that's a good deal!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for food and studying. Nice chill place to go for an afternoon.

Update: still love this place but Im currently being attacked by flies. The garage doors aren't even open today so I can't explain the surplus of flies : ("}
{"text":"Okay, they don't have Malibu but the DO have my favorite coconut water, C2O. It's in a can and they sell it by the case. I LOVE IT! 

A writer's group I belong to meets here monthly. Free Wi-Fi and large tables are definitely a plus. On cooler Phoenix evenings, they lift the door and the place is breezy and pleasant. 

Try the Dirty Doctor and you might end up nursing a Luci-style sandwich hangover. The Melt has Luci's house-baked turkey, roast beef, cheddar, avocado, horseradish mayo and their signature barbecue sauce :) 

Saturday is Jazz Night: haven't stopped in yet but am intrigued...

And if you get stuck for parking, try the backdoor. It's easy access :)"}
{"text":"What a great place to get coffee, tea or a multitude of various drinks.
They also serve wonderful food and pastries as well. I love that you can buy a few healthy groceries and little kitschy items too. 

A favorite meet up spot for my friends and I."}
{"text":"I've found myself at Luci's several times in the last few weeks as it on the way home from my doctor's office.  I am glad to see that is pretty busy every time I stop in because it is a great little market.  I do find the selection a bit odd, but I always find a few things to take home with me.  I haven't found anything specifically earth shattering, but some unique and solid stuff.  

I've enjoyed the super friendly service that I encounter every time I'm in and that they have an eclectic and fun menu.  I've tried the pumpkin spice latte, as well as the veggiesaurus melt.  The melt was just okay- I loved the mozzarella but the artichokes and peppers seemed a bit overwhelming.  Maybe throw in another veggie?  I also requested fruit instead of the potato salad and my strawberries were in pretty bad shape- they needed to be thrown out rather than served to me.  

I'm sure that Luci's will be in my regular rotation since I drive by it so often.  I'm looking forward to trying out their themed dinners soon."}
{"text":"Had never eaten here before, only coffee and tea on weekends before I went to another nearby option for brunch, lunch or dinner. I now have to put this in the rotation for food, as the Cobb Salad I enjoyed at lunch was superb, with an avocado citrus dressing that was perfect, and accompanied by a great green tea Arnold Palmer. My dining companion had the pancakes and raved about them as well. Already looking forward to my next visit to explore more of the menu, and grab an iced mocha while I'm at it."}
{"text":"3rd time here hoping for better than it is. Always below my expectations. Just because it looks like La Grande Orange, doesn't mean you'll get a comparable product or experience.  It has a long ways to go."}
{"text":"I've been to Luci's once and was fairly impressed with their marketplace area. I did not try their coffee, so I can't comment on that, but I glanced at their menu and the coffee selection seems decent.

I love that I can find all the great organic and non SLS beauty products here. They also carry my new favorite snack, Bumble Bars in assorted flavors. 

The day I went my husband and I were greeted by a very friendly employee who told us about some upcoming things they plan to do such as cooking classes in the store. 

I do find their prices on certain items to be a bit high. 

If you shop places like Healthy Habit and/or Trader Joe's this place is somewhat similar.

Only complaint is the parking lot, but I've had issues with that lot for years."}
{"text":"I've been a long time customer of Lucis. I've visited Lucis close to 100 times over the past few years and have always had a positive experience. I've brought out of town guests to lucis because it has been one of my favorite places. Today, I was thoroughly disappointed. Ordered 2 iced vanilla lattes, a bagel, and oatmeal. Lattes came out as regular lattes. No big deal, added vanilla syrup and the almond milk one was WAY too sweet. Again, no big deal. Honest mistake and the barista remade the latte. Bagel came out, great! After 30 minutes the oatmeal was still not ready. I went to check on it and asked why it was taking so long. I received a sarcastic response that they were still working on it. I'm sorry, but I know it doesn't take 30 minutes to make oatmeal. When the oatmeal was finally brought out it was just set down on the table and the server walked away. No, \"I'm sorry.\" Nothing.

The oatmeal was still raw and crunchy. It honestly wasn't edible. At this point we left. I'm disappointed. The gentleman who brought the oatmeal used to be my very favorite barista! :(

Maybe it was just an off day. Not sure. But I won't be going back anytime soon"}
{"text":"I am a frequent visiter in Phoenix and a family member recommended Luci's for breakfast. Luci's is a cute, casual, and delicious spot for food. I really enjoy the Acai (Amazonian fruit) super fruit bowl. They have a good collection of baked goods, and a wonderful variety to choose from. The drink selection is satisfying as well.

   Luci's has great seating, I never have trouble finding a seat. This seating including about seven bar stools in front of where the chefs cook food.

      In the middle of all the seating, there is a gourmet grocery and assortment of retro toys like wind up toys, fake glasses, books, pranks, and much more. Great small gift ideas. The store is always nice to browse, and in the middle of the rest of the restaurant. The overall pricing is moderate.

      I highly recommend Luci's for all who are looking for a comfy, enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Cute place had a late breakfast here. Wait staff friendly and food was delicious. You have to Order at counter but line moved quickly. Great little store and cute shopping center which can be hard to find parking at. 
Prices seem reasonable and the pastry case is inviting. Took a little treat home which was wonderful and devoured it in private. Seating can be challenging but I wouldn't hesitate to go again."}
{"text":"I always feel a sense of guilt having to write a less than stellar review after meeting the owner of a restaurant. 

Lucia was Beautiful and sweet, and a pleasure to meet, my lunch, however, was not fit to eat. 

I ordered the THE HUMM-DINGER VEGAN WRAP: Roasted artichoke, zucchini, red bell pepper, onion, fresh spinach and hummus with a balsamic reduction drizzle, with a side of fruit and the sun dried tomato wrap. 

Notice it says \"Roasted\", the cashier told me the Veggies were \"Grilled\". Unfortunately, to my dismay, they were neither. 

Everything inside was heated up, by either stove or microwave, I'd guess the latter, and the \"Sun Dried Tomato Wrap\" was thin, doughy and utterly flavorless, not to mention a shocking pink color, which I'm sure was due to being naturally colored with beet juice, but did not help make things anymore appetizing. The fruit was a soggy pile of your typical pre-cut cantaloupe, honey dew mix. 

It was not what I was expecting AT ALL, when I think of a grilled veggie wrap, I imagine tasting all those veggies bursting with flavor after caramelizing on the grill, they had no flavor though. I also did not expect the temperature to be Hot, chilled would have been better in my opinion if the veggies had actually bee grilled that is. 

This lunch to me was less than average and as I sat there will my full plate in front of me I was asked how my meal was, I clearly stated my concerns as I have here and was simply told that it was a \"Best Seller\". 

Lucia did send over a piece of chocolate cake, which was appreciated, but unfortunately missed the mark since I'm Vegan and the desserts aren't. 

Honestly, in my opinion, aside from the market, most of the menu items are anything but healthy. 

The 3 stars is for the market, my food would have been 1.

And that folks is why I am the Lunch Snob!"}
{"text":"It is amazing to me that this place has 4 star reviews. I met a friend for breakfast and the first thing I encountered was the long line to order food with only one cashier. This is the type of restaurant where you order your food and they bring it to the table. Since the line was long and I was waiting for my friend I sat a table to review the menu. When we finally did get in the queue to order we nearly lost our table as a gentleman grabbed the table we were sitting. I politely told him we were sitting there but he hadn't ordered either and was waiting for a friend. He ultimately conceded but he was rude. Not a good sign to have a minor argument with another patron before you even order food.

Once in the queue we waited over 10 minutes just to order. Just prior to the cashier there are all sorts of trinkets and things to purchase. I was utterly mortified when the first thing I saw was a plastic \"poop\"-type squeeze toy with the word \"POOP\" in big letters on the packaging. 
Now I am a medical provider and am not the queasy type, but this is in such poor taste, I should have left right then. 

I ordered an omelet and was just shocked that is had absolutely zero flavor. It was $13 dollars (with a cup of coffee) for omelet and potatoes. The potatoes were inconsistent and hot and cold in the same bite. And no flavor. Zero, zip, zilch.
The service was fair and we sat in our coveted table for an hour after we finished eating and no one picked up our dirty dishes or even asked if we were done. 
Would never recommend would never go back. And there is nothing very healthy about this place."}
{"text":"this is my favorite place for breakfast. i dont get to eat there often but always look forward to a green tea smoothie, with the burrito bomb (chx chorizo w/ sun dried tomato wrap) and the blueberry flapjacks are incredible."}
{"text":"If I could give Luci's six stars, I would! I am gluten-free and dairy-free by necessity. I get so tired of having to shop in several stores (usually Whole Foods, Fresh & Easy and Fry's) to fill my pantry and still feeling as if I missed out. Today, I discovered Luci's and was I in HEAVEN! Not only do they carry most of the gluten-free items I already use, but they carry so many I have never tried! (All items are competitively priced, too!) Additionally, they have cold beer and freshly baked goods on-hand! Ken, the store owner, literally gave me a 20-minute tour of the store, made several helpful product suggestions, and then had his barista create an iced, drip coffee with rice milk for me! For anyone that knows me, this makes Ken a keeper! I generally avoid coffee bars because none seem to carry rice milk (which is my favorite alternative to dairy; soy is too harsh for me, too). Ken assured me Almond Milk is also available. As great as all of these points are, the best is that Luci's is a locally-owned business.  Oh, and they host cooking classes on Sunday nights. I will be back and I will be telling everyone about this place to the point of annoyance...  :)"}
{"text":"Went for the first time with my family the Saturday morning before Mother's Day. The food was excellent. I was able to get a truly gluten free meal and did not get cross-contaminated at all. We love the atmosphere and funky store. It was very hard to find parking, we had to keep circling around the building waiting for someone to leave but it was worth it."}
{"text":"I really like this place. This was my first time here after driving by it several times. Met a friend for breakfast and had the huevos rancheros plate. The side of lentil pico de gallo was amazing. My one year old enjoyed the kiddie flap jacks. 

I didn't get a chance to look at the entire market since I was on a time crunch but I hope to be back soon. 

The only thing disappointing here is the access to the restroom. I had to take my daughter there and had to wait until the line to order died down just so I could squeeze through. And when we were finally done, I had to wait again just to get back to my seat. Not convenient and I'm not even sure it's wheelchair accessible. Not cool. Or maybe I'm missing another restroom somewhere else there?"}
{"text":"What is there not to love?? Amazing, pure, healthy food at reasonable prices and no need to worry about a server. The counter service is pretty amazing in itself."}
{"text":"I ordered a breakfast burrito and bagel from Luci's on a busy morning at work. I did use a delivery service to order my food, but was pleasantly surprised that it showed up fresh and hot and ready to eat! My plain ol' breakfast burrito wasn't so plain after all! On a fresh tomato and basil tortilla, with seasonal potatoes, eggs, sausage and cheese, it melted in my mouth! It also came with a fresh side of salsa which was absolutely Devine. My bagel was customized with cream cheese and sausage, and it was delicious as well. 

I have driven by Luci's every single day for over a year and never realized was a miss it was! I will defiantly be stopping by again soon! What wonderful food!"}
{"text":"Walked over today to check it out. Only tried the lemon bar but the menu was pretty extensive and varied. It's a little pricey for me but it smelled great, so it would be something to try when I want to treat myself. 
It was very busy which is usually a good sign but the ordering process was a little confusing. The menu on the wall listed drinks only and you had to either order the specials on the chalk board (which wasn't very organized and some didn't have prices listed) or grab a paper menu once you got close enough to the counter. They  had a fridge with salads, yoghurt and juices. No dishes on the food menu were under $5 from what I saw, even a simple plate of eggs and bread. I guess you pay for the \"organic\" bit. However, I couldn't tell what was made there and what was fresh - I assume the baked goods are but the bagels were in bags. It probably says on the menu somewhere...
The lemon bar was tasty and very hearty, though it wasn't as flavourful as others I've tried - basically just sweet lemon. I couldn't taste the crust at all. 
The staff were all really friendly, and that's always a bonus. 
I have plans to go back tomorrow morning to try the breakfast and coffee and will update then.

----
UPDATE: Went in this morning for coffee and breakfast. Had an egg Sammie (scrambled eggs w/ your choice of cheese, meat and bread) with provolone and bacon on an English muffin. The eggs were very fluffy with real bacon bits mixed in, topped with the cheese and sandwiched in the muffin, sliced in half. It's a decent portion size - however, since this is something I make at home all the time for myself, I'm not sure if the $7 was worth it, but it was still a really good, filling breakfast. I also got a 12 oz. of the day's house blend and added in low fat milk and sugar myself. The coffee wasn't very strong but that's my fault for not asking for the more bold blend. Mom's slice of quiche (which she said was very good), my Sammie, a mocha and a cup of coffee was nearly $20. A little steep but it's a good environment and doesn't feel snobbish like a lot of Whole Foods-type places. 

My assessment of this is not a place for the casual, every day diner still stands. This is more of a place to treat yourself. I'll come back but not as a first choice."}
{"text":"A black tea & their fast Internet and I am good to go!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for so long because it's a place I see other foodies post about. The only thing I regret is not having come sooner. I brought by brother for breakfast, he had the Big Boy with a pancake on the side (the pancake doesn't come with the order) and I got the flapjacks with pecans. At first I kind of felt like i was settling because the order of flapjacks is just that, it doesn't come with any sides and I never eat pancakes by themselves. Nevertheless, I was actually blown away and Luci's flapjacks were the best pancakes(flapjacks, hot cakes, whatever) I've ever had and I've never had favorite pancakes."}
{"text":"Although I like Luci's and continue to come back, my food seems to be always missing something. From the 12th Street location I ordered a chili burger it came with no Chili's. I ordered a Cob salad from the Bethany home location no bacon and some of the lettuce was really brown. That is consistent something is always missing. But once you get it the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast spot! My husband had pancakes and bacon and I had the potatoes medley and sourdough toast! Yum!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Really great for a small sandwich shop. Very much like LeGrande Orange without the wall to wall people. Yummy salads, sandwiches, and confections. I love desserts but the side salad with goat cheese was great."}
{"text":"I strolled into Luci's on accident on a Saturday night after Dick's Hideaway was PACKED and although it's not the bar atmosphere Dick's is, they do serve and sell alcohol as well as have TVs showing sports. I was shocked to discover that this place wasn't packed. 

Their menu has a wide variety and the best part? breakfast is served ALL DAY! Although it was around 8:00 p.m. I had a hankering for something sweet and was highly satisfied with the \"Funky Monkey French Toast\" so much so that I'd venture to say it's the BEST french toast I've EVER eaten! 

In addition to personable and prompt service, there is plenty to peruse in the \"market\" while you wait. The only downside is most of the merchandise seems to sell at above an expected value. 

Still, so glad I stumbled in here!"}
{"text":"This place tries to act like a local neighborhood cafe, but in reality is just another of those trendy, cool places that is a little overpriced and a little pretentious. 

It is not bad, just not anything special.  Will I go again? Probably, but I won't go out of my way. Meh."}
{"text":"I work in the businesses next door and everyone told me good things about this place from day one! I've been here twice in the short time I've been working and I LOVE it. I usually go for breakfast and the acai bowls are the best. It comes out in a small bowl but it's quite deep and you get a lot of food with it. The menu ranges from breakfast to lunch sandwiches and offers a lot of choice. I've had the crabby omelette and I was so surprised. It had a good amount of salmon and crab in it which made it super yummy. The eggs were also very fluffy and again the portions were on the larger side so you get the bang for your buck! 
 
They also have a ton of wine to choose from as well as little gifts/trinkets/candles you'd find at urban outfitters if that's your cup of tea. 

Overall I love the vibe of this place and would recommend :)"}
{"text":"Great food & great service! 1st timer and an employee noticed I was looking over the menu quite hard and helped me out with the menu. She told me her festivities & I picked one.( the turkey lurkey) sooooo good! With a side of \"tots\" sweet potatoes and regular tots. Not to mention we picked up some fun trinkets. Def will be back thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Just relocated back from Seattle and struggling to find a good coffee house that's not a Starsucks. So I was happy to stumble across this place. 

Parking not so accommodating but this center never has been and it's worth dealing with for the food, atmosphere and COFFEE!! 

I had the big boy breakfast and it was real good. The bacon was crisp but not burnt and the scrambled eggs were omelet style folded over which was a nice presentation.

Now the real kicker is that I love an ORANGE MOCHA, they actually had the orange syrup and made it so tasty. First place in Phoenix I've found, and honestly not sure I'll go looking for another. 

All the staff is friendly and talkative and they have a killer little market with fun gifts, and god healthy snacks, cheese, wine, gluten free selections, etc.  

Check it out!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast today and asked for two scrambled eggs and an English muffin. I was charged for a breakfast sandwich hold the meat and cheese which is a bit expensive considering I didn't order meat or cheese.. $11 including my coffee and they put cheese in the egg anyway.. Ugh. English muffin was not toasted and did I mention there was no where to park?  A bit chaotic but love the idea."}
{"text":"Luci's Healthy Marketplace isn't bad. The customer service is good. I had ordered a smoothie and purchased a few items. The atmosphere was nice. Its a nice place to take a friend for coffee or lunch. I did enjoy the smoothie and everything. Keep up the hard work!"}
{"text":"First time I tried this today. The place is quite open and airy allowing a fresh breeze into the dining area. It has a organic store in the back. The food was excellent but the downfall is the wait. Our food came out at separate times about 7 minutes apart. However, getting past that, the food was very good. I had the all natural burger that came with tater tots and sweet potato tots. Those were exceptionally yummy. My boyfriend had the french toast (which I tasted) and it was cooked well. 
The place was fun and the food was great, but those dining here need to know the wait is a bit excessive."}
{"text":"My first time here as I'm visiting Phoenix and it was just absolutely DELICIOUS! I got the Big Boy Breakfast and my table split the Slapjacks! The eggs were well cooked, the potatoes were great and the turkey sausage was my absolute favorite part (the flavor was soooo yummy!). The Slapjacks were also awesome! There were no complaints at our table! 

The only downfall were the flies that were constantly trying to get at our food because the restaurant keeps their garage style door open - so be prepared to swat at them!"}
{"text":"LOVED the atmosphere and the open air setting.  Food was delicious, we will definitely be going back and even pick up dinner on the way home from work!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a healthy and hearty bite to eat! Ordered an a√ßa√≠ bowl and split it with my boyfriend. Food is a bit pricey but servings are above average so I can't complain. Would definitely come back again to try something new!"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere, and they also have very friendly staff.  I live nearby, and so go there a fair amount for coffee, lunch and light shopping.  I find their food to be good, and I like the atmosphere, and the friendly staff.  I guess the only complaints I would have are the lack of parking and fairly high prices.  I guess you gotta pay more for 'organic' and wholesome' though."}
{"text":"This place gets busy. Definitely a cute/fun/hip place to go. Has a vast array of clientele here. If you have a big group it will be hard to find seats all together. 

Good breakfast /brunch type food selection.."}
{"text":"Split a wrap with my favorite companion (wife). Nice, fresh, little dry, but a HUNK of turkey can be that way! Love crispy dill pickles, had one of those, couple of BIG strawberries. ALSO split the carrot cake, yum! plenty big to split, nice frosting, great, moist cake. Saw some AWESOME sandwiches being delivered to other tables, will try one of those next time!"}
{"text":"This place is unique - maybe a little like La Grande Orange. Both times we've been here it hasn't been very busy. The service was good and food was fresh. They have some vegan options, but only one item labeled as vegan on the menu, the Humm Dinger Vegan Wrap, and it's okay, but kind of boring.

So the only draw for me would be the coffee bar. It's not a place we would drive out of our way to go to, but if we are in the area, we'd stop here for a change.

When the weather is nice and the garage doors are open, it's a nice place to hang out while you eat."}
{"text":"This is a very interesting place, didn't sit and eat but I wanted to!  Food looked delicious, however parking is a bear.  That so far is the only negative or problematic thing I found.  Hope to check out the food at some point."}
{"text":"All day breakfast!  A good stop after some exercise along the canal in the Biltmore area.  Grass fed beef burger and tuna salad tasty protein loads.  Coffee shop.  Juices.  Gifts."}
{"text":"Tried it again, went in for breakfast and thought I would have fresh food.  The potatoes were frozen from a bag, I saw here put them on the skillet in front of me.

Again, dissatisfied with this place, went in expecting more for the money.  Really high prices for same packaged items you can find at Wholefoods or Trader Joes for probably cheaper."}
{"text":"Seriously, one of my favorite places to eat, meet or journal.

People are always helpful and happy :)

You cant go wrong with any of the food - yum!"}
{"text":"I love Luci's! The food is fresh, healthy and delicious. They have the ability to make almost any menu item gluten free, which is huge for me.

In addition to the food, the market is super fun! They have wines, freezer items and lots of fun little trinkets. Perusing the market makes any wait for your food fly by.

I personally would recommend getting a bagel with lox, the funky monkey French toast or any Sammie! I don't think any menu item would be a bad choice.

My only complaint is how pricey it is. We rarely can eat here for under $30 for two of us, with gluten free adding $1-$2 per item."}
{"text":"I once again feel the need to sing my praises for Luci's. And more specifically, the weekday morning crew. At some point I bought myself the best supplies to make myself a morning coffee for the road. And sometime a few days ago, I realized that was a damn waste of money. Because I was only going to end up at Luci's. Luci's is where I can go to get a nice dose of sunshine, both weather wise and people wise. Luci's is where I can go and make up my morning song about hot coffee, and rather than have the staff look at me funny, they freestyle right along with me. Luci's is where the name field on the order sticker doesn't say name, but rather says neighbor. Luci's is where I can get breakfast for breakfast, lunch and dinner. And weekday morning Luci's is nice and calm and quiet, which allows me to start the day at my own pace."}
{"text":"Love this place. I'm a regular. The staff are kind and friendly and the kitschy stuff they sell is hilarious. The food and drinks could use an upgrade, esp for the price point but I'll still always come here. The $11 refillable cup is worth it. The iced tea is perfect."}
{"text":"I want to write a love poem for Luci's. And their omelets. That's a weird statement, I know. Even though I've been in this neighborhood forever, I have yet to try Luci's. I was told they have tons of stuff that was gluten free not only in the market, but also in their food section. And they do!

Marketplace. Now, I honestly think that they are pretty overpriced for some of their gluten-free stuff, but they do offer some varieties I haven't seen at a traditional place like Whole Foods or Sprouts - AND this place is super cute too. It's a pretty small marketplace compared to a grocery store, but when you shop here you can get an awesome meal and cup of coffee. 

Eatery. This is my favorite part of Luci's. You can order food or coffee at the Coffee Bar sign. They have tons of stuff - again, the omelets are my favorite - and plenty of treats. Endless choices for coffee too. PS they offer GLUTEN-FREE BREAD. Oh yum yum yum!

Also, be sure to check out their website and sign up for cooking classes. They're a bit pricey - $39.99 a piece, but they sound super interesting. I had to cancel the ones I had recently because of a timing issue, but they sound SO good! 

Why not 5 stars? Well, the parking. I HATE the parking! It's in the weirdest L-shaped shopping center and I had to double-back a few times in order to secure a spot."}
{"text":"I was in the area and I googled places to eat.  I have been trying to eat really healthy, so I decided to try it.  It exceeded my expectations.  I thought the staff was friendly and the food was delicious.  I was blown away that healthy food could taste so good!  All of the items on the menu seemed unique and out of the ordinary, but definitely tasty, organic and good for you.   They also have huge coffees if you are an addict.  I would definitely recommend it and personally return.  Hopefully they will open on in North Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Soy Coconut Latte.....FTW. I can die in peace.

We finally made it here, we are moving to this hood soon so I wanted to see what will soon be a short bike ride away. We only got lattes, and then snooped around the marketplace so I can't vouch for the food...yet.

I am so glad I read Amber W's review or I would have never known about the elusive Soy Coconut Latte. It's not apparent right away what flavors you can have in your latte so I asked and eagerly awaited my coconut delight. My girlfriend got a vanilla latte which she said was good, then she tried my coconut latte. Holy hell, I haven't seen her express so much delight or get that look on her face in awhile(sad right?). I agreed and spent the next 20 min slowly savoring every last drop. 

I love the cups, the material and design keep in the heat and it doesn't require a sleeve - plus it just looks cool. We browsed around the store a bit, everything is impeccably organized, tidy and clean. They have some good stuff that we regularly include on our weekly shopping list, albeit most of it was at a higher price. They carry some local items(Simply Bread, Salem's hummus and pitas, etc) that are hard to find anywhere else, although again they are slightly higher in price. 

I love the open air concept, the people all seemed great. I see people complaining about the parking, maybe some days it is a problem but really people need to get over the typical Phoenix strip mall:  HUGE massive parking lot out front with stores set far back off the street. It ruins the aesthetics and appeal of the store front and isn't as inviting. I will be biking and/or walking here soon(as others should try to do as well) so parking becomes a mute point. If you really have issues with the parking park in the huge abandoned parking lot west of 16th st and walk a couple hundred yards - problem solved.

I didn't see too many vegan items, lots of gluten free stuff but no bakery items or section marked as vegan. I also didn't see much on the menu that was vegan either. I was secretly hoping that since it was called \"Healthy\" Marketplace it would have more(hasn't anyone read The China Study\" ?). A few more vegan grocery and menu items and this place would easily be a 5 in my book; this area is desperately in need of it.

I am not sure which direction Luci's will head, the marketplace is a nice idea, but I am not sure I could see myself buying much in the way of staple items. I could see this place maybe expanding on the cafe and seating and maybe going towards more of the specialty market(read things you CAN'T find anyplace else). I am excited to see where Luci's ends up in the future, I will definitely be back for the coconut lattes and hopefully to try some menu items(I can give you some great vegan ideas - I need a breakfast/brunch spot with options!)"}
{"text":"Excellent omelette and coffee. Fabulous atmosphere. Free wifi. Great experience. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Found this little gem, a while back. Have been here about half a dozen times now, always spot on! Gods is delicious and plentiful, and the coffee strong . Nice work"}
{"text":"coffee, breakfast to go, bamboo plant gift, vitamin supplement, cooking class, it's all here.

--Great selection of diverse products, all packed into one little corner.
--coffee bar too! great spot when the weather's cool to relax
--houseplants and cool plants for gifts or for your desk at work
--lots of supplements and organic stuff
--one corner has a grill setup with seats 'round it, for demos, cooking class, or for freshly cooked food!

I can't wait to spend an hour in there, just exploring!"}
{"text":"Luci's is always fun to visit! They serve breakfast all day and have some of the best coffee drinks in the valley.
The vibe is very casual and laid back and the staff is unbelievably friendly!
They also have a little shop portion in their store with whimsical items. They're great for small gifts or souvenirs if you're a visitor to AZ. 
The only thing I dislike about this place is that if they are busy then expect to have issues finding convenient parking."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! First time here but I will return. Food was great and the atmosphere. I ordered the huevos rancheros with the green lentil pico de gallo it was amazing. There is also a store that sells fun stuff and one of a kind items. The only downside is there is limited seating but the service was awesome!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced. I stopped in just before 2pm on a weekday. All I wanted was a pre-made sandwich and a basic cup of coffee on my way to an event. There was no line to pay so I was hopeful to be in & out in a couple of minutes. Instead, the cashier was extremely distracted and asked me the same questions twice, she was not even close to listening. It took 20 minutes to put the coffee in a cup, and that was after standing at the pickup counter and asking for it several times. No apologies for the delay whatsoever. I will not be returning and will be deterring others from giving them business."}
{"text":"How can you not love this place??!! 'Goodness for Goodness sake!' and it really feels like that sometimes. When you are out and about needing some lunch and the thought of other fast food places just curls your stomach.. This place, for me, is like a oasis in the desert. I can pretty much just point to anything on the menu and know that I will recognize everything on my plate. Good quality products and the little store is full of recognizable health food brands at reasonable prices. I recognized many things that are lower than Whole Foods! Definitely right on par with Sprouts, but more of a small-town local feel. I love the staff!!! Never hesitating to stop and give encouraging comments or advice on products. All of them super friendly! I can't go often because I live in Gilbert but my grandma lives nearby so I just can't wait everytime I come see her. 

I can see that there is probably lots of people who want lots of stuff for free and to them I say.. Go ahead and get your 10 boxes of pop tarts for $10.. I'll take Luci's and real food any day. Keep up the good work and if you ever open a second location please consider Gilbert!!
Note about the parking: it was crowded both times and both times I did have to circle round back and then back up front but always parked with maybe 2 minutes. 

I have only ever been for lunch but have loved every minute, every bite, every coffee sip and every bit of small talk with the staff."}
{"text":"This is my first ever YELP so be patient.  I was just thinking that I am sick and tired of using \"starbucks\" as my office away from office and I wanted to find a new place that has access to a patio or some kind of fresh air, internet, and a nice environment to work in. 

Well...By George I think I found it!  Luci's is a mix of a vegan/organic market along with a coffee shop.  It has a giant garage door (think Postino) that is open today due to the nice weather and a full selection of coffee and other type quick bites and pastries.

I settled into a nice couch space by a window and am working away on the FREE WiFi sipping one of the best tasting coffee drinks in town and muching on a organic food bar.

Overall, the place feels good and is comfortable enough top come for a casual coffe and read the paper or hit the office work in a better environment.  Plenty of light to do work and also not too crowded so you can have a conversation on the phone or in person.

The only thing left to be desired is the \"barista\" wasn't the fastest man on the planet...but this is Phoenix and its more about quality than fast service here."}
{"text":"Oh Luci's.  I really wanted to love you!  Sadly, I cannot.

When you see 'Healthy Marketplace\"  there is a certain level of expectation that comes along with that.  Upon first glance at the menu it's pretty obvious that most of it isn't healthy what so ever.  Where are the fresh salads?  How about some quinoa or beets?  Whole wheat pasta?   How about something made with fresh, local ingredients?  I tried a veggie wrap of some kind and it was ok.  Not memorable at all.  And everything is prepared in this tiny 'kitchen'.  It looks more like a demo kitchen!  How can you truly create amazing food if you have no space to do it?
All in all, Luci's is a big disappointment in my book."}
{"text":"Went to Luci's recently with the wife for a mid-week breakfast.  I had thought that the food was going to be just pastries/bagels/etc. but was pleasantly surprised to see they offered 'hot' food.  We both ordered egg/cheese/bagel sandwiches, mine had turkey included with the eggs.  Each also got a coffee.  

The food was good, pretty good sized portion and I thought it was a pretty good value, but my wife and I liked ours.  The coffee was fine, nothing spectacular, but there were four different varieties, including some organic choices, which I liked.  I did not like that the labeling was not great on the creamers, which lead me to having skim milk instead of half/half.  (Probably mostly user error, I'll admit).  

Loved the garage door that was open.  Perfect weather for it, the temperature was great and gave a nice feel.  What I did not like was one of the side effects...flies, and lots of them.  Not sure if there is some way around this (fans?) and also if this is some sort of cleanliness issue (I've certainly been to other places with patios recently that did not have flies buzzing around me the whole meals...don't get me wrong, it wasn't a plague of flies, but near constant buzzing around my food).  The second thing I did not like was the music.  Oh, the selection was fine, but I'm not sure why they had it so loud, kind of annoying.  Plus, in the morning if you have news channels on your tv's in your coffee shop, maybe you could put that audio over the speaker?

Anyways, solid 3.5 for Luci's, though I'm rounding down to 3 stars for the flies/noise.  Might be back, but not sure."}
{"text":"Not sure if they are having a bad day, or short staffed, or just lowered the bar of expectations....I Came into Luci's caf√© today finding the open tables dirty,  food on the floor, garbage can overflowing, air conditioning is either broken or not set at a comfortable temperature.
Went to use the washroom, finding one of them completely out of toilet paper, paper towel on the floor... The next washroom had paper towel on the floor and burnt out lightbulbs.
Disappointing for sure!!"}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars, I would!
This place not only has a great grocery store with a huge selection of gluten free products, but they have an awesome atmosphere cafe with seating throughout the store!!!!! I love this place and the owner is just an incredible guy that goes out of his way to be helpful and turn you into a customer ------- hmm, what do they call that --- oh yeah, CUSTOMER SERVICE - a lost art!!!!! Love this place and they have me as a customer for life!!"}
{"text":"Luci's has finally emerged from their growing pains.  In the beginning, the entire neighborhood was pining to love a new locally owned joint.  But like any emo teenager striving to fit in, they swung from one identity to another often, which compromised the consistency and end-product.  After four-ish years however, they seem to have left their pimply pubescent years behind them and offer plenty of good stuff.  The food has been great of late.  One of my favorites is the Turkey Lurkey, a hugely satisfying sandwich of smokey turkey, apple wood smoked bacon, avocado, havarti and pesto piled high on toasty sourdough.  Another great pick is the tuna nicoise salad, and they know a thing or two about making a turkey burger juicy and luscious.  The baristas and register workers are finally with it, and crank out delicious coffees and pastries.  Although the grocery area has improved dramatically in my opinion, it's still a bit pricey for \"health\" snacks and such (think $7 bags of kale chips).  Make sure you grab a coupon they keep near the register for 15% off 3+ bottles of wine, and pair your grapes with one of their wonderful cheeses in the refrigerated section."}
{"text":"Love this place to get one of a kind gifts, great lattes, a solid omelette, take a cooking class or just to stop by after I've done some shopping at Poor Little Rich Girl.  It's like a coffee shop and home-goods boutique rolled into one.  One point of contention is how cramped the place is.  Every nook and corner is filled with something and waiting in line for your drink you feel in the way with people delivering food, getting drinks, or just browsing around."}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly here!
I love the big selection of teas they offer and my coffee always comes out exactly how I want it.

My only complaint is the wait. It shouldn't take more than 5 minutes to make a latte when there is no one ahead of me.

A good spot to study or visit with someone."}
{"text":"I had one of their omelettes, and an order of their French toast. French toast was cooked just right, with slight crispiness on the outside and warm satisfying bite in the inside. Coffee was just right, just enough kick to start my day."}
{"text":"Another happy 5 star review. I went here last night because I was disappointed with Whole Foods on Tatum. I ran out of Bragg's Apple Cinnamon Vinegar, so I drove up here to stock up. I must say that I was a happy camper. I bought 4 cases and even received a 10% discount. Very helpful staff. Shop here if you need Bragg's products. Definitely the best place to buy them!"}
{"text":"Ordered the egg sammy and being vegetarian asked to sub avocado for meat and chose swiss for the cheese that is supposed to come on it.  Arrived with no cheese and 4 very small pieces of avocado.  Had to stand in line to get someone to assist and after they brought it back they had put a very tiny slice of cheese in the egg that was now cold.  Servers apologized that it took so long as they had supposedly been heating it on the grill; why so cold then?  Also ordered a cinnamon roll that they forgot to give us so we had to get up again and wait to get it.  They were very apologetic, but still a bad experience.  They have a great space, but not planning to return for their mediocre food and service."}
{"text":"I wish there was more parking. It's a pretty busy corner but once you get inside you have the option of all day breakfast, sandwiches, salads a coffee bar and surprisingly a grocery store. I ordered the huevos rancheros and it was AMAZING! I felt like the side of lintels should have been served hot but they were still delicious. $15 for the rancheros and a small chai. The chai was delicious. They don't have dome lids so if you ask for whipped cream you won't be getting a full drink. Over all I would definitely recommend this place. It's different, healthy and delicious."}
{"text":"So THIS is what coffee is supposed to taste like!! I have been having coffee at chains for years and thought it was fine. Then I had Luci's latte and am a convert. I live in Mesa now but used to live in the area and I make excuses to come to Luci's for coffee. I've never had any of the food, but it looks great and I love the local atmosphere. Great place - would love to see it thrive!"}
{"text":"This is a cute, hipster cafe with a bit of the Oregon coffee-shop vibe. The theme screams \"healthy eating\" including the desserts I selected from the cookie jar. I stopped in on my walk back to the car after dinner for and the idea seemed perfect. Guiltless cookies to satisfy the sweet tooth after dinner! I was in and out of Luci's really quick so I didn't get a chance to read whether or not the cookies were gluten-free, but I would bet my bottom buck that they were. They were super light and almost flakey and not too sugary. My favorite was the snicker doodle, which was closer on the continuum to a moist shortbread than to a sugar cookie. To me, the sea-salt double-chocolate cookie was a bit salty for my taste, but my fianc√© liked it. 2 gourmet cookies on the go for under $3 is a good deal!"}
{"text":"I don't know. It's okay, but I don't think it's anything special. I like shopping local like the next Gen Y kombucha drinking rescue dog owner, but the prices are too high, the layout isn't cohesive, and it's cramped and tiny. It's bodega meets whole foods, and that's cool and all, and I hope it stays open and busy, but... but, I guess I'm cool with my TJ's/AJ's/WF circuit I'm currently stringing on."}
{"text":"First time going to this wonderful little market place and eatery. Had breakfast before work and it was quite pleasing.  I got a egg & sausage sandwich on english muffin.  Tasted like something from the my own kitchen.  Just wonderful. Service was great too. I believe the manager was sitting next to us eating her own breakfast and was talking to us about the place.  Very nice, and I promise you we will be back!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a while so I decided to meet a friend here for breakfast. The atmosphere is always good so I was looking forward to it. My friend got a green tea smoothie and she couldn't finish it saying it was disgusting, I tasted it and agreed. She ordered the three egg breakfast. How could you go wrong with that? Our order came to our table, again very disappointing. Over cooked eggs, wet barely warmed deli ham, not ham steak, and not even browned on the flat top. Toast wasn't even toast, it was barely warmed bread. The potato medley was hardly cooked with no flavor, no seasoning and no caramelization crunchy goodness. I mean seriously, how can you show no love to an innocent potato. I ordered the breakfast sandwich which sucked! It was an over cooked bacon omelet with barely any cheese on an English muffin that wasn't even toasted. Really?!? They weren't really even that busy considering it was a Sunday breakfast rush. It's like their Chef could care less about the food he/she puts out. Worst thing of all my friend calls me 20 minutes later telling me she threw her breakfast up on the way home, poor thing. Now that's saying something about their food! Stay away my friends, steer clear of Lucie's by all means necessary."}
{"text":"Checked out luci's at the orchard and then couldn't pass up coming to the marketplace! Love it! Great options for someone with both gluten and dairy allergies. Would highly recommend. And also just a fun place to grab a small \"just because\" gift for someone."}
{"text":"Loving this place. Was like a smaller Wholefoods Market in regards to fresh cooked food station & additional prepackaged goods, kids items & organic hygiene & household products like Meyer's. 

You order at the counter just inside the front entrance whether or not u are ordering sit-in or take-out. Menu is on the wall to the right. Cashier staff was quick & friendly. Then u take your # to your seat & either walk around to look for additional take home items or hang out for a very short wait for your food. 

I had the Huevos Rancheros, which I ordered w/ my eggs scrambled - I have no desire to eat raw embryo. I also ordered a side of potatoes, which they call the Signature Seasoned Country Spuds. It's basically every type of potato, including sweet potato & excludes boring old russets. Lightly salted & some other seasoning, not oily or over cooked. Really tasty. Hubby had the Krabby Pants Omelette, which he admitted was quite a fitting description of his old geezer personality. See the detailed food descriptions on one of my attached pics or on the full website menu. I also had the fresh squeezed OJ, Hubby had lemonade. Neither had ice since they were nice & cold - both appreciated. Hubby also had the Double Chocolate Sea Salt Cookie. Hold on to your britches, but that was the item he like the most. Imagine that??

I really enjoyed the whole experience. Food was tasty, beautiful presentation, nice cafe atmosphere, no significant wait to order, friendly staff, clean restrooms & price reflected the overall quality. However, the drinks were a bit pricy when u consider the taste. Just ok."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Luci's for years now.  I usually come in on the weekends for breakfast to indulge with some Funky Monkey french toast, but today I popped in for lunch.  I had the Hot Juan black bean buger sub vegan cheese and it was super yummy!!  I chose to eat it open and toss the top part of the bun for my own health reasons.  (bread addict in recovery)  The kale topping instead of iceberg lettuce is a nice plus, and every veggie head loves avocado automatically being on a sandwich.  2 thumbs up Luci's, welcome to my lunch restaurant rotation!"}
{"text":"Love this spot for the solid breakfast fare, good coffee, perfect atmosphere for a business meeting or a place to stop at after the gym.  They have a bunch of stuff to buy, novelty items and such.  I'm glad this place is around."}
{"text":"This place is like toy story now....
Andy got a new toy and nobody plays with woody anymore. Empty shelves and dirty tables

Food is still great though.  Manager is trying to run around and do it all. She is trying"}
{"text":"I love this place ! The food is healthy and BOMB, and all the knick knacks are fun too look at and buy. Highly recommend. The tea is great too. I had a caramel something or other and it was sooo good."}
{"text":"Wife and I went to Luci's this weekend for lunch. I loved the idea after driving by and then checking out the website. I was surprised at a few things. Waiting by the kitchen area to grab a menu, the grill was a freakin mess! We almost left right then. The manager? guy was kind of pestering the chef? to get this next order right. The chef guy seemed very disinterested in listening to him. Kind of weird. 

Food order was wrong. They offered to remake it which was fine. Then the order came back out and they were out of chips this time, so I had to choose a different side. 

Cramped interior. Had to squeeze between tables to the side of the garage door to some baskets mounted to the wall to get plasticware. Just not what I was expecting. Kind of amateurish feeling. 

Won't bother going back."}
{"text":"Went to Luci's today and I'm a fan!  We bought this do it yourself salsa kit and a bag of chips for about 7 dollars, not bad.  I made the salsa today (tomatillo with habanero) and it was really very good, and a lot of fun to make.  The chips were by a company called \"Garden of Eatin'\" and were better than the salsa!

I can't wait to explore this place a little more.  Skip Starbuck's, and go to Luci's."}
{"text":"Luci's is a great little healthy market in north central area of Phoenix.  We went for lunch one day during the week since they have a little cafe inside the market.  Service is kind of slow, but the food was good. The atmosphere is interesting since you sit pretty much in the market.  It's got a cute \"vintage/hipster\" look to it.  I love it but want to hate it at the same time. Does that make sense? Phoenix is fast becoming a \"Hipster-esk\" type of city, and this joint falls right in line with that feel.  I want to not like it, but i do... 

...Ok I'm rambling.  Check them out, the food is good."}
{"text":"Love Luci's! They have the best portobello mushroom burger and happy hour blended drinks are such a great deal. The staff have provided excellent customer service in my experiences."}
{"text":"My go to spot for coffee on the way to my office every morning. Situated on what one could call the coffee corridor with no less than THREE coffee spots at the same intersection.

Coffee is top notch and the breakfast options are enough to ruin anyones diet. Even at a \"healthy\" marketplace I can destroy my diet....."}
{"text":"Highly recommend. Good coffee? Check! Good Food? Check! Great environment? Check!  Plus they have a great selection of craft and local brews. I come here at least every other week. Great location. Parking is suspect. But other than that this place is golden."}
{"text":"Luci's is a great little neighborhood store nestled on the corner of 16th St and Bethany Home. They offer a full breakfast/lunch menu (order @ counter, then delivered to table), plus a unique variety of items that you would find in a boutique-esque grocery store. I've only eaten breakfast here, and many times at that as well as quick stops  for their coffee or a six pack of cold ones. The strawberry waffles were very enjoyable, and the Mrs said the hash browns (mixed with sweet potato hash browns..mmmh!) and the yogurt parfait were also very good. 
They have garage style glass doors that are raised during non summer months that allow for a great breeze and view of this busy little intersection.
The parking is a bit of a disappointment but I guess you cant win them all. After breakfast or lunch swing by Dick's next door for a drink or wander over to Poor Little Rich Girl for some boutique shopping, great neighborhood spots, wish there were more of them."}
{"text":"It's so nice to find another local place to have breakfast! However , a few things I found annoying and I've only been there twice.  Each time I've been there on a weekend morning, one of the registers was not working correctly.  Menus are not easily accessible until you get to the counter to order.  This can be really annoying because either you know what you want or you have to wait a few minutes until the people in front of you decide what they want to eat while 5 people behind them are waiting patiently.  And the cashier is pretty slow.  The pricing seemed reasonable however it was $8.99 for french toast (3 pieces-no bacon or saugage included) and around $2.50 for their organic coffee.  The food came out hot and looked great although it was way sweet to me.  Too sweet to actually finish and I love french toast but not Luci's.  I will give them another try because it's local and close to my house.  I heard there's Jazz on certain nights, so will have to try out dinner."}
{"text":"coffees pretty good and staff is friendly"}
{"text":"Really good food with fresh ingredients. I had the Hummdinger and I am now going to dream about it in my sleep tonight. The only downfall of this place is that it is always so crowded.. And a little pricey. But I suppose you are paying for quality ingredients. Worth it."}
{"text":"4 star service 2 star food = 3 stars.

The bfast potatoes were undercooked and obviously microwaved, not grilled.

The bacon was just OK.

The prices are HIGH, both for the menu & the grocery.

Wi-fi is unreliable.  When it goes out, it takes them 15-20 min to reset it.

Great friendly service.  Nice, sunny outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Goodness for Goodness' sake! Luci's is awesome, the slogan is correct. The market portion carries great local and regional items and contains all sorts of sundries (produce, spices, dairy, hand cream and beer and wine). I always find something unique to take home for dinner. 

My much loved breakfast is the burrito bomb  - scrambled eggs, chicken chorizo, sweet potatoes and cheese wrapped in a sundried tomato tortilla and served with spicy salsa. It is heaven. 
There is a roll up garage door that is almost always open making the atmosphere very inviting. The coffee is strong and the service is top notch, this is my favorite spot for a quick breakfast!"}
{"text":"Spent the evening with wife in bathroom vomiting + diarrhea after having a 'doctor' sandwich and chop chop salad today for lunch. I am hoping my 9 months old who had grilled chicken won't get sick :("}
{"text":"The coffee is great, the store is fun and unique, but that's not the most important part. Everything on the menu comes in a gluten free option! From all of my gluten free friends I have learned that getting French toast or a waffle is not generally an option. Here at Luci's you can get everything gluten free. Even the bagels and wraps. I absolutely recommend a drop in if you're ever in the area. The produce used in their food is super fresh and high quality too. My breakfast burrito this morning has types of potatoes I didn't even know existed in it."}
{"text":"Great place for a healthy breakfast. The food is so good! This place has so much charm as well!

They are a market, fun toy/book shop, coffee bar, healthy diner all in one. A great place to stop for a coffee and pastry or breakfast, lunch, and dinner! 

Their customer service is good they are always really nice and quick!  I have ordered their omelettes which are super good and the potatoes they make with it oh my gosh delicious! 
I have also tried their acai bowls and I am addicted them. You definitely have to order one! 
Their breakfast burritos are really good as well. 
Their coffee is really good I typically order a cold brew. 
Parking can be a pain as this place is located in a high traffic area. Specially during lunch. However the vicinity they are in dies have a huge lot as well as another lot across the street. 
A must try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  I pass by Luci's a lot and always say \"one day I'm gonna stop in.\"  Well that day came and I wish I had saved my $18.  I ate as much as I could bear, about half.  So for $18 I was half full.  

Before I tell what I purchased, let me say that the place is way too crowded.  There's a diner-like section with seating area, grocery aisles, non-grocery knickknacks, coffee bar with seating area, patio.  I'm sorry, the floor space is poorly designed.

I had to ease on down the twisty winding road to go place an order.  And what a tight spot that was!

So, a slice of \"mile high\" carrot cake set me back about $5, (maybe $5.50).  Please stop calling it Mile High. It was only three regular layers of cake with just a sugary  white layer of frosting.  The size was not mile high, and the taste did not take me high either.  It'll do, though, if you're longing for cake.

The wild salmon with pesto was $11.  I asked for a wrap instead of bread.  It looked good, but was completely overcooked and I could taste no pesto at all.  I opened the wrap and found a smear of green oil, so the intent of pesto was there, but 'twas a worthless effort.

And the side of tater tots...Ummm, how can I put this nicely?  Fyuck!  They did not taste freshly made.  I should have opted for the side of fruit.  Oh well, next time.  Oh wait, there won't be a next time.  I've done the Luci thing.  No need to do it again."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the BLT, I seem to always find a must have trinket or food item at the register, i love the Bethany Hm employees, several have been there for a few yrs & greet customers by name (such a nice touch!) the burger (hangerover remedy) & monkey bread French toast, mouth watering!!!"}
{"text":"I've heard lots of good things about Luci's over the past few years, and had it on my mental checklist of places to go and check out here in the valley of unique and cool places.  A few months back, they were on Channel 3 during their Saturday morning broadcasts.

Parking here's a bit limited, but not bad.  I imagine if you were to come here on a busy week night it might be different, but overall not bad.  I walked in and really liked what I saw.  Cute setup, with a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Healthy without the feeling of eating or being sold bark instead of real food.

I initially wanted dinner, but decided on a bagel with cream cheese instead.  Here's where they loose a star.  ok, so on their menu, they have a bagel, cream cheese and lox combo for $6.99.  It comes with the onions, capers, tomato's and everything else that normally goes with a plate like this.  Well, I told the girl that I just wanted something lite, and if I could get a bagel with lox and cream cheese only.  She told me it was $8.99?  um, Can't you sell me the $6.99 bagel lox n cream cheese thing and leave the capers out of it? Why the extra $2?  Maybe I misheard...but if I didn't, that's kind of weird!  Why wouldn't she just sell me the $6.99 one?

Anyways, I ended up going with just a bagel and cream cheese with lemon water.  Bagel was great, and the cream cheese with whipped and appeared to be made in house!  They also serve breakfast all day, which I thought was awesome!  Totally my gig, as I sometimes like to mix it up and have breakfast for dinner on the weekends.  

Place is wonderfully decorated, staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  Bathrooms are pretty cool and clean for the most part.  I will say, I absolutely love how this place is decorated.  Totally my style."}
{"text":"Repeat dessert visit last weekend. I brought a group with me this time so we could try a bit more.

This Time:

Carrot Cake:
Moist, earthy, amazing delicious cream cheese frosting and not overly sweet. Very good and up there with the better ones I've had in phoenix.

Super Double Triple Chocolate Crazy Delicious Brownie Cupcake:
Sadly I don't remember the actual name of this but it was very good. They had another variation with walnuts but another member of the party had an allergy so we opted for this version. Death by chocolate for sure. One of those treats you can feel spike your insulin as soon as it hits your mouth. Splurges like this are what make life worth living. Don't deprive yourself of this type of thing just behave the rest of the time :)

Giant Cinnamon Bun:
This was a cinnabun on steroids, over twice the size and I think much better. Had a nice glob of icing in the center. The girl behind the counter insisted that she get to warn it up for me. She used some ridiculously cute phrase to describe how much more amazing it made it. In fact both times I've been in there she has cracked me up. Ah cute coffee girls.. you make my days a little better."}
{"text":"I love close by but don't come here enough! Yesterday, I had the Naughty Nurse melt-gluten free with a large green tea. Enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. The service was excellent. Going to come back more often!"}
{"text":"Oh Luci's, I am so in love with you. 

Your delicious soy coconut lattes, your delightful selection of vegan, gluten free items (in store and on menu), your cooking classes (I cannot wait to try one!), your friendly staff, and your beautiful, open, airy environment make you perfect.

Even better is that you are on my way to work and just a bike ride away from my house! This will be helpful because I need a way to even out all the calories I am drinking in these lattes!

I honestly have not a complaint... this really is true love!"}
{"text":"The store was really cute and the food was pretty good. I stopped by to kill some time and it was really well worth visiting."}
{"text":"Great local place.  All the food is good big thanks for the Gluten free options and stevia for my coffee.    perfect location for fast meeting or morning cup."}
{"text":"This place is adorable. I love the fact you can get your coffee with Almond Milk or any milk in the store. They offer a true non soy vegan option that is hard to find anywhere in the city. The store is willing to order anything you are looking for that they do not have in stock. 
Would recommend this place for anyone!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Some of the best french toast I have ever had! The staff is great particularly the owners. I would definitely recommend Luci's!"}
{"text":"Cinnamon roll was delicious, if a bit dry.

The table at the edge of the door, with the breeze blowing, was fantastic.

The tater tots were pretty good, the burger was very well presented, but was a bit uncooked.

The funky monkey French toast was goddamned amazing! HUGE slices, extra thick. Definitely want that again!

Great atmosphere, great food. Only complaint was our food was quite staggered."}
{"text":"Parking is awful! After several attempts to even find a parking spot, we just gave up and left. It was around 10am, so it wasn't during peak breakfast or lunch times. Parking is easier in downtown Phoenix than here!

Located on the northwest corner of 16th St/Bethany Home. The spots are very tight and face one direction. So, you would want to be driving south along 16th street, then pull in for a better chance of finding a spot. Forget it!

I like to support small business, but any business owner should really consider the parking situation before finalizing the location of business."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out and when on the way home from a training and hungry I decided to try it. Parking was easy which was nice. The gift shop was terrific with really great gifts (I especially loved the super irreverent ones!). I ordered a kale salad and foibles it down in a flash. There were lots of healthy and yummy choices. I loved the super stylish vibe which made me want to live in this area which I think is the coolest section of Phoenix. The Vig is across the street so I walked over to check that out as well."}
{"text":"Luci's is my all time favorite! They have options for everyone in the family. Lots of gluten free and vegetarian options. Their kale salad is super delish! Also fun to shop for one of a kind little gifts after you eat."}
{"text":"My running group and I love Luci's after a long run. This morning I ordered the KRABBY PANTS OMELETTE which was delicious but holy hell full of oil and calories. I didn't eat the potatoes that came with it. I did eat the little ramekin of fresh fruit that came with it. This meal was like 750 calories. I'm glad I ate it earlier in the day, I have the rest of the day to burn some of that off."}
{"text":"What an incredible place! I've been going here for 3 years and only have nice things to say. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"The veggie burger was really great!
I like the little colored potatoes as the side.


Cool little things for sale too!

Love to turn my friends on to this place. They always dig it!"}
{"text":"The coffee tastes terrible. Food is mediocre. $12.99 for a beeakfast burrito? Doesn't taste much different than Los Favoritos where you can get 3 breakfast burritos of the same size for that price. Sure the atmosphere and decor are great, but that's all this place has going for it."}
{"text":"I really like this place!  I met a friend here for lunch on a Saturday, and it was busy, for good reason.  Really fresh food, both breakfast and lunch options, and turned out quickly.  Ordering is done in line, which helps the crowd to move quickly.  The only downside could be finding a table during busy periods.  On top of that, it has a really cool neighborhood market attached as well.  Parking can be a struggle as well, due to the corner location,  but trust me, worth the little bit of effort to check this place out."}
{"text":"Have driven by this place several times and it looked like a pretty cool place.  Was in the area and figured I would stop by for a morning beverage and breakfast.  Upon entering, the place is a little smaller than expected and it was very busy at 9:30am on a Sunday.  You order at the coffee bar and the line moves quickly.  Gave the breakfast sandwich a try - interestingly; it was basically and omelet folded over and put between a bagel.  The flavor was good but the texture was much different than what you would expect from a traditional breakfast sandwich.  It was a fun place to checkout but probably wouldn't return back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the location of Luci's, as it's just a walk from my apartment. I would love to give this eatery 4 stars, but it seems every time I stop in the prices go up. The food is good. I usually get the Spaniard omelet with a fresh orange juice. It's tasty, but nearby at Dick's Hideaway you can get a huge breakfast for not much more money. The retail store portion of Luci's is adorable and I love their random and weird finds! A great place for coffee and a snack!"}
{"text":"Okay wow this place is cute and makes an amazing veggie sandwich that even me, a hearty meat eater, can get full off of! The Naughty Nurse is jam packed with a combination of veggies and sauces that go very well with the crispy wheat bread it comes on. I suggest getting the pasta salad for a side! This was the perfect lunch break spot AND they have the coolest store that sells everywhere from farmers market type food to stuff you would see in the apartment section of urban outfitters!"}
{"text":"Finally made it over to Luci's today and will definitely be back.  Best cappuccino I've had in years!  My husband got the day's breakfast special--egg and chorizo breakfast tacos--and my kid thoroughly destroyed one of the blackberry honey bran muffins.  Everything was delicious, service was great. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. Every time I've come I have enjoyed the food. BUT, getting my fiance to come here is a struggle. The parking is horrendous, there is always a massive line, and there really isn't enough seating. This makes for a sort of chaotic visit at times. On the other side, they have lots of delicious healthy options that taste hardy and they have lots of cute little quirky gifts that you can browse while you wait on your food/drinks if it's to go. Overall, I'm a fan. I just wish they had more space."}
{"text":"This review is only on the food. The atmosphere was great and the health store looked cute but I did not spend time looking around. It was my first time there so I got fresh squeezed orange juice and a crab omelette. My friend got the portabello mushroom burger. For spending 15 dollars and the place was packed, I was excited for my breakfast. The waitress was lovely and I will will probably try it again because the people were very friendly. Getting to the point, my omelette was okay but nothing special and pretty small compared to most breakfast places. The potatoes looked beautiful but they came out very mushy actually all the potatoes were super mushy like frozen and microwaved tasting so it was disappointing. My friends mushroom was under cooked and the avocado was way under ripe so overall we were all disappointed with our food. I would expect some fresh food in a health market but nothing was very appetizing. I may go back to check out the market but for the price will not do the food again."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast I've had in recent memory. Basted eggs hard and cold, roasted potatoes cold and hard -I think I got the leftovers. I'm super disappointed. The coffee; however, is on point."}
{"text":"I love this place! Egg Sammy and pancakes are wonderful as are the smoothies!  neat ambiance too!"}
{"text":"Checked out Luci's today. Great food, quick service for how busy they were. The naughty nurse sandwich was very tasty, the hubby had a breakfast burrito which was decent and our 5 yr old had the kids pancakes with fruit which were outstanding. Don't order the Tator tots as they are nothing special but the side of pasta salad was very nice with good flavor includes asparagus, peppers and tomatoes. They have fun different flavored sodas and lemonade as well as a coffee bar and don't forget the $3 Mimosas. Everything else though seems a bit pricey. We had a great meal and will be back."}
{"text":"I stopped in after Mass yesterday with my friend Meaghan.  We try to pick a fun different place each time.  Luci's was on the agenda this week and what a nice little surprise!   It's a mix of a market and cafe with interesting seating and stylish decor.  It's very open and I loved sitting next to the big garage door wall with all the windows.

They have an omelet station where you can pick the size and what you'd like in it.  I chose the Moe cuz I was hungry!!  Was up at 7, did a killer yoga class at 9, went to Mass at 11 and was completely ravenous by the time we arrived.  The Moe omelet was eggs, choice of cheese, choice of veggies and choice of protein.  There were at least 8 veggie selections and if I wanted to I could have had all of them.  I picked mushroom, spinach and onion with bacon for the proteing.  It was served hot, fresh and with a side of nicely salted potato cubes.  It was the perfect size to fill my starving belly.

I'll definitely be back to try the pastries (50% off after 5pm daily!) and some of the ready to take meals."}
{"text":"Luci's is a good neighborhood spot to buy your health foods, drop in for a coffee or fresh made baked good, or pick up some beer or frozen meat on the way home.  I agree with Pamela's sentiment about it being a marriage of TJ's and Hi-Health with AJ's prices. 

I've had a couple of bad cups of coffee here, but in the 10-12 times I've been they have always been very nice and have remedied any problem very quickly. If it wasn't on my route, I may not stop here much though. Trader Joe's and Hi-Health are right next door to each other at 20/Camelback and you can save a ton of money if you do it that way!"}
{"text":"Had a friend bring home sandwiches and sides from here when I was sick about a year ago. I remember it being a very tasty lunch with only the freshest highest quality ingredients. I am eager to visit Lucy's in person."}
{"text":"I ordered my regular Soy Coconut Latte - it wasn't the same. It was still good, but not as good as the countless times I had ordered it in the past.

Additionally, I had ordered the lemon burst cupcake which the cashier repeated back to me but never charged me for or gave me. Since I wasn't charged for it I decided it was a sign that I didn't need it!

I had come to do a little work on my laptop. I love my laptop but the battery life SUCKS and I had to sit somewhere with a nearby outlet. The table that I wanted to sit at was dirty.
For the entire two hours I was there.

If this was my first, I would have given it 3 stars, but since I know this was all just a fluke, and that Luci's is better than this experience, I will give it 4. 
But only 4 for this experience. It is still a 5 star coffee shop to me!"}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 star review rounded up. This place reminds me a lot of La Grande Orange. A small marketplace with healthy, expensive, rare organic gluten free stuff that doubles as a restauraunt/cafe. There really is no ambiance, i mean you are basically eating in a grocery store, but they play good music, have fresh, flavorful food. There breakfast and lunch are very good and reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. They also sell a lot of local and hard to find items in the market, but beware as it is pricey."}
{"text":"I wish I was closer to this place because I would visit more often. This is a great local coffee shop in a neighborhood that is growing.  The coffee and food is great.  My one problem with the place is the parking.  The last time I was in the neighborhood, I had to drive around several times to find a parking.  I love that this is a coffee shop and market.  They offer diverse products that you would not find in other stores.  Check this place out and grab a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Me and my wife went there after church yesterday. it was a great good food, great service, even when they had computer problems, we sat outside it was really cool."}
{"text":"Really cute cafe/shop. Food was really good. And I loved all the cute stuff between the store and the tables. It also had grocery and other healthy items in the shop area. We want to go back and try some more food."}
{"text":"5 STARS!!! I was able to find vegan options AND they accommodated to my request of having veggies stir fried in avocado oil!!! Love love love!!!!! And, everyone was super nice :-)"}
{"text":"Great healthy choices. Lots of salads and sandwiches. Great breakfast too. Staff is always friendly...both locations can be bit crowded."}
{"text":"Staff is great, food is Okay, this place is just busy and if you have time to kill and just want to get lost in the day, this is the place to go. Pry wont go back."}
{"text":"Qualification - I am rating the Healthy Marketplace side and not the coffee bar:

Just left a movie and wanted to pick up something quick/easy to go - drove by Luci's the other day so I stopped there to grab some chow.  The space itself is cool and has potential.  But...

1.  Many of the goods are the same as in the grocery (some stuff from regular groceries, other stuff from Sprouts/Trader Joes type places) but they cost more.  Five or six bucks for some healthy cereal.  In particular I was disappointed in the wine.  I guess its just my style, but I like a variety of affordable small-production wines.  They had small production wines, just not cheap.  And then they had the same Clois du Bois red wine that has been on sale for $8.99 in Fry's/Albertsons/Safeway for the last five years, except here it was $13.99.
2.  Grabbed a chef salad and a meatloaf sandwich to go.  Salad looked good (and was) - big pieces of chicken and egg - but,....   No dressing!!  The meatloaf was Ok at best, the bread was probably sliced and placed in the box 8 hours ago, and it came with 2 wedges (wedges for a sandwich?) of tomato and two little tiny strings of roasted red pepper.

I had high hopes based on the name/location/etc., but I was disappointed.  Maybe try some quirky grocery items and wines?"}
{"text":"Food is very healthy and tasty. Trying to get lunch there every time we in the area. My daughter is vegan and they do have that option. The only tip to follow is that when they ask u if u want the receipt get it. some times they forgot to give u small baking goods right away and it is hard to proof that u bought and paid for it. 
Other wise I would definitely recommend this place and I love this place. 
Also they have a store on a side with lots of organic and vegan food and other merchandise. 
Little bit expensive, but good things are. 
\" not all expensive things r good , but all good things expensive \""}
{"text":"Hipster hangout, that's the best way to describe this place. But the food is excellent and service is very fast and extra friendly. I like the coffee, it's a nice light roast and it's organic. Most of the omelettes and breakfast dishes are a little pricey for me as a daily routine, so I order the medley potatoes with an egg on top, which runs about $4. But you can get a \"fancy\" breakfast that would feed 2 skinny Europeans for $10, so that's a good deal too. Eat here or don't, but do visit! It's the most interesting touristy place I've found in Phoenix so far!"}
{"text":"Um wowza this is the best place to come after a hike, to study, or just to grab brunch. My go to is the gluten free bread with the salmon sandwich... DROOOLLL!

They have great iced tea's and everyone is absolutely wonderful.

{"text":"Turkey Lurkey.....BOMB!  Great service, friendly and helpful staff!  That being said, I have some beefs...Healthy to me is low calorie, low sodium and low fat.  You can't douche your veggies in butter and throw mayo on every sandwich and be considered \"healthy\" in my book.  Labelling everything with \"organic\" or \"all natural\" doesn't make it healthy.  Cool stuff in the marketplace but too pricey.  I will return due to the taste but not the \"healthy\" tag.  On a side note, the people who eat here are also very nice to look at.  Eye candy and a great tasting meal = a very nice lunch break."}
{"text":"Luci's is a one of my favorite places to stop in. From the culture to the food it's an A+. They have a great menu that includes an all day breakfast, sandwiches/burgers (hot and cold), salads and a coffee/smoothie bar. There green tea is so my favorite along with there naughty nurse sandwich and kale salad. The atmosphere is adorable and I love the market place, you can find some
Cute gems. If you have not checked this place out your missing out for sure. 
Ps. The people that work here are delightfully kind and always make my day brighter. I work in the restaurant industry and you don't find many places with good food atmosphere and employees and this place has all three and more."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good customer service. Tried the Grassfeed Luci Burger and it was good."}
{"text":"This is a very busy spot (well each time I have been here) - I've come for breakfast a couple times.  My initial visit was with a friend in the area who is a regular.  Each time I've been its been a good time I will agree - that's more the company though.  They have some great items for sale - including rare gags (a bit pricey as appears all the produce/products in the store).  Parking is a problem during busy hours.  To the food... Its just been ok in regards to the breakfast food - understand I've kept to standard breakfast foods though (eggs, muffins, sausage, potatoes).  The potatoes were cold in the center this visit - so claims that they come out of a bag frozen are pretty much solidified for me.  Last visit my friend got a wrap and I had a bit of food envy.   Its a unique enough experience that I will go back, its a nice place to have a talk/drink when you can get a seat.  I'll try a wrap next time."}
{"text":"The guy at the counter on Saturday got this one an extra star. He was super nice. I dont really understand this place and I want to because i LOVE LOVE LOVE their graphics & neighborhood. But when I go in I don't see anything I really want (and there is always something I want/need) Doesnt look like they make their own pastries, and scone was no bueno. Wish they had more healthy breakfast items like fruit, granola combo deal or oatmeal, or better looking muffins. Or if they made carrot juice or something you cant get anywhere else like that. Or hmm. I don't know. I'm going back. I want them to kick ass!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now for breakfast with friends. It is always packed and parking is a bear. Either park across the street or behind the plaza. Anyhoo, I love their iced coffee!! I thought Starbucks was strong, this blows them out of the water, great coffee. I had the Breakfast burrito, it was huge. I was hoping by the menu it would be great, it was ok, the sausage was ok, they did use alot of different types of potatoes, sweet, russet and some type of purple kind so it pretty much sucked up all the moisture out of the burrito. The salsa on the side was average but was not nearly enough for the whole burrito. I would suggest the iced tea..soooo good. It is a great little place, especially when they open the doors and luckily a breeze blows in. They are also pet friendly."}
{"text":"I love this neighborhood and one of my favorite places to go when in the area is Lucy's.  The store sports a combination of espresso bar, healthy and gourmet grocery store and natural \"drug\" shop.

The staff is most friendly and makes wonderful espresso drinks. Lucy's also offers breakfast and lunch as well as a vast selection of to go items. There is a large sit down area as well as bar where you can enjoy your food and access the complimentary internet wi-fi."}
{"text":"This place opens super early, which I definitely appreciate and service is way beyond friendly (in a good way :D).  I had the breakfast burrito with bacon and avocado & a vanilla latte that set me back $5.25(!).  I'm not really a coffee snob -- mostly a Dunkin' Donuts coffee kinda gal -- and this was nice & smooth, but certainly not $5.25 nice.  Now I looove breakfast burritos, and this one had an awesome variety of local potatoes in it + sweet potatoes that made this a nice little burrito.  There was no avocado on my burrito though, but it was easy enough to let someone know, and they gave me a few slices.

The ambiance is super cute, and I like all of the organic/natural/pretending to be organic & natural under the guise of excellent packaging drinks, groceries, and knickknacks that are lying around.  I wanted to try many of the desserts in the counter, but will give them a shot if I ever come back.  Food is a solid 3, but ambiance and friendly service compel me to give this place 4 stars, but ultimately needs improvement for price point."}
{"text":"A girlfriend of mine moved to the neighborhood and I was paying the obligatory post move visit.  We were RAVENOUS. 

She suggested we go to Luci's for dinner. Neither of us knowing whether they actually served dinner. 

Luckily for us they do, until 9 pm and breakfast is served all day. 

We both had our eyes on the same sandwiches- The Zeus and The Juan with a side of sweet potato fries. 

The owner was also present and gave us a little history about the neighborhood, his establishment and the types  of patrons that frequent the store.  Supposedly the mornings are hoppin with single people grabbing coffee so I guess you could mix it up with some young professionals on your way to work. 

The prices for everything were reasonable. Both sandwiches were fresh and delicious. I'd return for another dinner maybe try some breakfast. They serve waffles and I love waffles."}
{"text":"Another visit to Luci's for lunch - delicious, delicious black bean burger with kale slaw.  Really good.  Nice atmosphere, great green tea, nice staff, fun products.  Always nice to have a really comfy place to get good, fairly healthy, food."}
{"text":"I'm here for my first visit. Some really great points, some not so good and some irritating, at least for me.

I got the krabby pants omelet. I'm not a fan of cutesy names - I finished junior high long, long ago. The omelet was good - probably 3.8 out of five. A shade too salty which overwhelmed the omelet elements. The potatoes were also just a bit too salty, but did have several different kinds of potatoes - 4.3.

The small cup of fruit is the best I've had in a restaurant in ages. Everything in it was perfectly ripe and there were a good number of fresh pineapple pieces in it. 5.0.

I got water to drink - I'm really cheap. Breakfast was close to $12 with $1 tip - a bit much.

The decorations and merchandise sorta shoves that cutesy/kitschy vibe down your throat.  Gag. I'm not admitting there are several things I'm considering buying. No, not admitting that. 

A good place for people watching.

Will I be back?  Ummmm . . . Not a great value and not all that healthy.  Those sweets do look very tempting . . . Which is bad, very bad. I probably will be back, but . . .  I'm ambivalent.

Oh, and most irritating of all was the young man who referred to me several times as \"young lady\".  I'm old enough to be his mother, if not grandmother.  So, I felt patronized and insulted. I considered making some crabby comment to him, but, as an old woman, I've learned to put up with obnoxious,  cutesy whippersnappers. And, yes, I am crabby with a c, not a k - krabby is obnoxious and cutesy.  I may be obnoxious, but certainly not cutesy."}
{"text":"Great place to come and get a bite to eat any day of the week. I especially love their egg creations that they serve all day... Excellent coffee. The staff is very friendly and courteous. Food ticket times are very fast and the quality of the meal is worth the price.

Love to come here on the weekends and get some food and hang out & get some work done on the free wifi. Have been a regular customer ever since I discovered this place."}
{"text":"Really cute atmosphere and friendly staff, and opens up during spring and fall as a great seating area. Coffee and groceries a little over-priced, but the seating area makes up for it. The green tea smoothie is amazing."}
{"text":"Great pick up and go spot - lots of healthy options! I had breakfast burrito which was really delicious and unique! I'd highly recommend it for any vegetarians (you can also add meat)."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at Luci's.  I ordered the beet salad, and it was very tasty.  I left with a Toddy to go, and it was really nice as well.

I enjoyed browsing in the store after finishing my lunch.  They have a lot of really cute things to look at, and they carry Crow's Dairy goat cheese!!!  That's a big one for me!"}
{"text":"Hummm where do I start.  I guess I came in expecting more.  Having worked in a couple of successful small locally owned health food market cafe combos while still in college I know what is possible.  
I was truly expecting more health food and suppliments.  This was more of an upscale QT (I like QTs) with a cafe and a mixed bag of suppliments.  It wasdifficult manuvering through the cafe tables and meandering patrons to get to the market section. 
When it came time to check out....maybe I was lost but I didn't find a market only register, just the one at the cafe front was staffed.  It seemed awkward and they acted like they are not used to seeing market items at the register.  
Also remember to bring your own bags.  I bought 8 items, forgot my bag and I had to use their basket to get my stuff to my car and then bring their basket back.  
I did enjoy my fresh squeezed orange juice I picked up for the road.  
I may be back to try the cafe, but I will continue to go to Sprouts for my health food needs."}
{"text":"I just really want to love this place.  It's near my house, cute, with neat stuff in the store and a hip urban vibe badly lacking in this part of town.  But I have gone there probably two dozen times in the last two years and each time I leave in a bad mood because of the horribly disorganized service.  I honestly can't understand how the cashiers can be so distracted, unless having ADHD is part of the requirement to get hired here.  And as for other commenters who have found the staff \"friendly,\" I have not really noticed that.  They aren't unfriendly, but they are in my opinion, much too spacy to really be friendly in any meaningful way.

Although, it has belatedly occurred to me that maybe they are all just high..."}
{"text":"I love Luci's. I'm lucky enough to live in walking distance, so I've been several times and never been disappointed. Food is great, the people working there are really friendly and helpful, they are a community-oriented place in a sea of money-oriented places - I love Luci's. The Burrito Bomb, the Turkey Lurkey and the potato salad are some of my favorites."}
{"text":"Cute kinda novelty vibe stuff and some expensive grocery items. Food isnt all that great but its a good vibel with tons of cool knick knacky things you wont find anywhere else. Worth a trip."}
{"text":"I stopped by at the recommendation of a friend and found the staff friendly, helpful, and expeditious. The coffee I had was just the right mix of strong, and not too sweet.  Their pastries were exceptionally tasty.  They are apparently done by a company called 'Wicked', and Slade Grove (The Owner apparently) was there, and was also exceptionally friendly, and mentioned a Peanut Butter Pudding he was working on.  I am going to have to go back there and try that some time."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place,  the people were great!  But the food was so so.  I ordered  the burrito bomb with turkey,  and half of it was filled with ham. Unfortunately i haven't been a pork eater in over 15 yrs so my stomach wasn't so happy after i figured out what that peculiar taste was in my burrito."}
{"text":"I went here the other day and was treated so rudely by manager and staff I wanted to jusy run out.  It seems people working here look down on single men.  From calling me honey to ignoring me to disrespecrltful dialogue, I will not be coming back.  This place has gone downhill."}
{"text":"Very nice selection of good quality dishes. As always, \"healthy\" can easily be undone by cheeses, mayo, and other yummy additions so be careful if your idea of \"healthy\" is low cal or low fat. The sammiches were fantastic, the dill potato salad - yummy!, and the tots were pretty good. The market itself has a nice selection of items that you don't usually find often in regular grocery stores (five+ types of quinoa! ;)). I'll definitely be back, whether for a specialty grocery item or for a great meal."}
{"text":"Loved this place, its different kinda like eating at a whole foods or co-op but really yummy for sure. Their drink selection is as good as their food with many new or hard to find elixers as anywhere. Tried the greenchile pannini and it was bomb! Can be a lil crowded during the lunch rush so take someone with and have them hold down ur seats as the other makes the order as they dont have waitstaff."}
{"text":"We're new to town, but simply put...having a place like this in town makes us real happy. Great selection and ambience, awesome staff, not the greatest prices but that's expected."}
{"text":"Luci's can leap from Two Stars to Four, in a single visit!

Jaek and I recently hung out at a table in the open garage-door, inside patio type area of Luci's, and we both had a great time. (see photos)

A big reason for this was the friendly and helpful demeanor of Braden, a barista/juicista/pastryista behind the counter.
After eyeballing a red velvet cake slice with cream cheese frosting dolloped up on top that actually had *GLITTER* covering it, I asked how they made edible glitter, or if those were just for show.
He explained about pulverized polished sugar, and after I shared that I have a bonified, legit case of picaphobia (glitter - it's little tiny sharp edged peices of metal or hard plastic, you know, with a mind of it's own, an inability to wash off, a tendency to get men in trouble for indiscretions at the boobiebar, and a seeming ability to reproduce.  I think it may be alive and evil, actually), and that I was taking a huge psychological step in overcoming it by having decided that I was going to get one of those slices and actually eat my psyche's penultimate nemesis, he congratulated me and said that it was on him.  

Well, since he comped that glittercake, I felt allright splurging for a tasty, but still overpriced, big glass of fresh squeezed OJ.

I tried, but couldn't find a single expired meat or cheese item in the fridge case.  I still say it's a weird conglomeration, and a bit pricey, but if I was a local without a car, being able to walk here every couple days would be wonderful.

Oh yeah, the fine folks at Luci's have put up a nice plaque thanking the local firefighters who saved their place from destruction during Richardson's recent burn."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's average. I think the food should be better than the hype and cool factor and it's not. Always food should be first and foremost. Service and lack of the wow factor can be overcome by great tasting \"original\" food. The fresh fruit wasn't fresh. The sandwich average, nothing over the top for $10."}
{"text":"Luci's never disappoints! Had breakfast there with our friends last weekend, happened that they had crock pot corned beef hash as their special. The best hash I have eaten in a long time! Both hubs and I had it and were delighted. Coffee is wonderful and the ambiance is comfortable. We go early, so not so crowded at that time. Great experience and a good start to the day!"}
{"text":"Luci's is amazing! I love coming here for a casual breakfast or lunch. Today I tried the Zeus turkey burger which was delicious. It's a cute little spot in uptown and the perfect spot of a post hike meal. The only down side to this place is the limited parking. Other than that it's great. They have great food and iced tea. They also have a bunch of eclectic and quirky gifts throughout the store. Perfect stocking stuffers for this time of year. If you're in the area and looking for a healthy local meal this is your place!"}
{"text":"Healthy, vegetarian friendly restaurant and market.  If you are looking for a healthy meal, funky gift or organic fare look no further than Luci's.  Great place for coffee or tea and a quick snack."}
{"text":"Overall, not too bad. Their food seems decent so far, but not quite worth the price tag. The people at the counter were really nice."}
{"text":"After dropping $100 at the nursery this morning for my new patio, I needed something for breakfast and a nice iced tea.  My neighbors told me about Luci's and I've driven by a half dozen times.
You can build an omelet there by the size: Eeny (just egg), Meeny (egg and cheese), Miny (egg, cheese and veggies), and Moe (all the above with a protein).  I had a piece of spinach quiche.  I also ordered a large iced tea.  Well, I was sipping my tea, waiting for the quiche to be heated.  And waited.  Finally, after bumping into my massage therapist (she's the BEST!), I asked about it.  They had forgotten me.  :{  Oh well, they offered a free Danish to make up for it while they heated up my quiche.  
They have a section of teas and different foods.  It's a small section and the prices are a little higher than you'd find at Sprouts.
I'll be back a million times, since it's so close to home.
Let's hope they don't forget me next time ;}"}
{"text":"The breakfast here is always fresh and they have a great garage style door to sit and enjoy your cup of Joe before the craziness of the day begins.  Be careful they have a ton of little knick knacks and gag gifts which, if you're not careful, will ding your pocket book.....leave you saying how did I walk away with a $40 bill......."}
{"text":"The wife, kid and I like to stop in for breakfast on the weekends!  The burrito was awesome! The only negative is some of the prices in the market are a little high, though it does save me a trip to the big stores."}
{"text":"Love, Love Love Luci`s!!
Whether its a stop in for coffee, a sandwich, a delicious brunch or picking up groceries, Luci`s has it all!! They even have live music on Saturday evening and offer cooking classes which I might have to try!
Live nearby so love stopping in here and staff is always great!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go in the neighborhood!! Great coffee and so thrilled to have tasty gluten free options! Also love the variety of things that the marketplace has to offer!"}
{"text":"Wonderfully delicious food and great environment. I highly recommend the portobello shroom burger. Staff has always been friendly and helpful every time I've visited. The marketplace within the location is also cute for gifts and such. Definitely one of a kind from what I've experienced in the area. 

The only downside for me personally is the cost. However, in their defense, fresh ingredients and a unique place come with that price. 

As a side note, not everything there is healthy, but they have no shortage of healthy options!!! Great for vegans, vegetarians, and otherwise. Something for everyone!"}
{"text":"I had an omelet with turkey chorizo with an English muffin side, excellent presentation and good quality food.  Sorry, so hungry after my work out I forgot to take a pic of my food.  Anyways here is a pic of the inside that has great foot and a small local grocery store full of unique and healthy items.  The heat is finally out of Phoenix so they had the garage doors open which is great but I hate those pesky flies!!!!  I'm gonna have to invest something to get rid of those things for outdoor eating.."}
{"text":"Sure it's walking distance from my house - so I was hoping I would have a new place for my morning tea.   After finally re-opening after the fire on 16th and Bethany Home, I was excited to check out Luci's.

The design of the the place is fantastic simple, sexy, a little modern and throw in some retro corner grocery feel.  I was greeted with fun, friendly service, and then left with a great pastry and a tasty ice tea for the road.  

They seem to still be working out some kinks since the re-open, but I see it only getting better.  In fact I just got myself excited.  I think I am going to head over there now for my morning snack."}
{"text":"Super cute laid back spot to grab a bite, shop a little, or meet up with friends. They have a good variety of sandwiches, coffee , and pastries that you'll enjoy. If that's not enough , the market sections are also filled with unique snacks and cool merchandise to tKe home or just look at."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere. Had breakfast here and it was really good.  Coffee is great, too.  The vibe is similar to La Grande Orange, but even more neighborhood \"market-y.\"  Focus on healthy, natural stuff (no Diet Cokes, but I can live with that!).  Reminds me of some places I've been to in LA neighborhoods like Silverlake or Abbot Kinney in Venice (for those of you who might be familiar with some of the hip locales in Los Angeles).  Haven't been to Luci's for lunch or dinner, but I just might do that in the next couple of weeks."}
{"text":"The only reason we drove all the way out here was for their \"peppermint pancakes\"advertised in azcentral.com well when we got here they looked surprised. WTH? We are from out of town looking for something to eat and since I'm addicted to peppermint this seemed like an awesome idea until we got here.... Hungry I just pointed to the next thing on the menu... BUMMED

Service?  Well the dude taking our order wasn't exactly apologetic said something like I should have looked at their Facebook page well d*** I'm not the one who put you on azcentral maybe someone should have corrected them? Just a thought...? The link they had was NOT to your fb page... Trying to ruin my day... I think if he was even fake apologetic it would have been ok I suppose... And their peppermint latte is a hint of peppermint... 

My food? COLD eggs, cold everything SERIOUSLY?!?!?!?

2 stars is for the knock knacks they have around 
If I lived here and this was the service I got I would NOT return... Not worth it. I'm sure there are other healthy food places in Phoenix/Scottsdale area with better food and even better service... UGH

Posting the picture that made me come out here for absolutely NOTHING!"}
{"text":"I happened to try this place out two years ago off of a recommendation from a business near by. Since then, I make my way to Uptown from Tempe whenever I can just for Luci's. The food is always amazing, the novelty gifts are fresh and hilarious, the staff members are awesome, and the marketplace is quite good as well. It's a no brainer 5-star review for me. If you haven't been here and are contemplating trying it out, I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Love this place! I tend to try to pick up breakfast here on my way to work once a week. Love the egg Sammie! Keeps me full but not uncomfortable full all day! I'd love to go into Lucy's when I'm not in a rush to work. Every time I am in there I find some new product that intrigues me."}
{"text":"Hooray for Luci's.  G-reat coffee, and I will specifically add great service as well.  I wanted a bagel breakfast sandwich with ham (not on the menu) and they actually made me feel like I WASN\"T being difficult. 

Now that's how you do it....

I know it might not sound like a big deal---To go see if there is ham available in the kitchen, and then make up a custom egg bagel for a customer's picky breakfast, but it IS a big deal because it is so simple, and so possible, and so often the answer is just  'no, it's not on the menu', because that's just easier.  

My hat's off to Luci's for being awesome.  Made my day."}
{"text":"Such an adorable neighbourhood grocer complete with organic milk in glass bottles... love the boutique feel and open vaulted cafe.. I will be back for food and shopping when I have more time to dig through their organic homegrown riches.."}
{"text":"Went today, Feb. 11, 2018. First, got in line and waited. There was a Spanish speaking person next to me and the cashier automatically assumed that my group was with her, she skipped to the next person in line. The cashier attending to the Spanish speaker was to the left of me and the cashier lady was tending to the right of me. She saw me and my group in the middle of the register line awkwardly standing there and didn't ask to help. So finally, the left cashier was done we were able to order. Placed our order, cashier couldn't figure out to split the bill. Had to wait longer. We sat down, and waited drinks never came. I asked the lady, where are our drinks while she was serving our food. She responded with I will make them right now. We ate, and finished our food. Never got our drinks. Asked for my refund, was not offered anything in return. I usually really like this place, like a lot. I have spent a great deal of money here. Just the overall service has gone down."}
{"text":"They got rid of their sweet tots :( this makes me so sad. It was the icing on the cake. I'm sure I'll be back for my hot Juan burger but there is a little hesitation because I don't really love their other side choices."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, but that was about it.  Our order encountered turbulence when \"the printer stopped working\" which caused my breakfast to take over THIRTY FIVE minutes to arrive.  They offered nothing more than a simple apology which was still appreciated.  The Krabby Pants omelet was much over salted and the same could be said about the colorful fries that it came with.  The food was over priced and lacked value.  There is no reason I would come back to this establishment."}
{"text":"I got a gift card for Lucci's and was excited.  The place looked retro-hip with some food, coffee, and natural food grocery items.  The tables could be full many times we went by so today we went mid-afternoon and had some really nice sandwiches.  I had Rosie's roast beef and it ROCKED!  The hubby had the special and between bites said it was good.  We thought the prices were a tad high even though delucious. We got to check out the grocery store portion and it is stocked full with natural, organic and gluten free foods.  Some novelties which were cute. Be warned - there are many urban hipsters about."}
{"text":"Gluten free dining and groceries in one cool place!"}
{"text":"Crabby pants keeps me coming back! I love it, not only that the staff is great, they have a great beer selection and organic treats and frozen foods and great juices and kombuchas"}
{"text":"Love, love this place!  I discovered it in the same little shopping area with one of my favorite consignment shops. Luci's has a cafe with seating, as well as a healthy \"grocery\" type area with healthy fare. The cafe has sandwiches, salads, and a great breakfast that's served all day. They have several coffee drinks also. One of my favorite items is the Smoky Joe's BLT, which I always get in a tomato or spinach wrap with a side of fruit. 

The grocery area has lots of gluten-free and vegan items. They also have some novelty items, my favorite of which is a sticky note pad declaring \"You're on my Sh!t List\" -- dang, that little sticky note pad is damn therapeutic!! 

Parking can be a pain when it's busy, so just be aware..."}
{"text":"The Gluten Free French toast is where it's at! 

Love Luci's!"}
{"text":"I started going to Luci's right when it opened - the 1st time and was hooked from that point on! It offers great drinks, pasteries, soups, and groceries in a welcoming environment.
I love the pasteries which are made in house and their house citrus green tea is a morning staple at work. The hote breakfast offerings are good, but take quite awhile to make it to your table. I wish tere was more than 1 cook on weekends. The only other issue I've had is parking can be in short supply on weekends since Dick's Hideway is next door.
Luci's has risen out of the smoke and become a great neighborhood staple!"}
{"text":"First off, I'm not from the PNW, but I'm definitely a big fan! This little market makes me feel like I'm being transported to New Seasons or Powell's in Portland! *Happy Thoughts!* 

I actually came to Luci's because I found out they carry my favorite brand of Kombucha (yes, Dr. Brew, also from Portland......obviously starting to see a pattern now [insert emoticon here]) But, when we arrived it was PACKED, people eating everywhere! It was Valentine's Day, so I suppose the rush might have been expected (or maybe that's just the norm for a Saturday?) Either way, these people looked like they were really enjoying their food, so, what's a girl to do? Join the bandwagon, of course! 

I ordered the 'Luci's Famous All Natural Burger' (sans cheese). Yes. Yes, I can see why it's 'Famous'..... I mean, absolutely  DELISH.......SOOOO Juicy and flavorful.... in order to be a *perfect* burger, it just needed an ever so slight modification....yeah, that whole \"bun to burger ratio\" thing, this guy was SO Juicy that my bottom bun became sopped through with juices, meaning it fell apart! If that doesn't bother you, then you are at least in for a very delightful tasting experience! I would order again for sure (for this particular burger, I can live with the soggy bun). I also ordered the house salad with the lovely sounding citrus vinaigrette, but alas, my salad came out completely naked, so I didn't' get to taste it. They were far to busy to ask for a side of the dressing, so I'll just have to try it next time. (hence the docking of one star)

As per customer service, we met Neil, who is related to the owner. What a fantastic guy! Super friendly and helpful, I found out from him that I could actually buy a whole case of my beloved Kombucha and get an extra 10% off the case! PERFECT!!! Addiction is officially fed [big happy emoticon here] I believe they do this deal for various of your favorite beverages, not just the kombucha (I know not everyone is a fan, but boy they SHOULD be!) 

The store itself has some of the regular things that health food stores offer, but they seem to be a little selective of what brands they choose to stock. I was very excited to find Maqui powder, something I keep checking for at Whole Foods and Sprouts, but usually to no avail. So, that was exciting. They also had a lot of cool odds and ends things - think Changing Hands meets Health Food Store - it makes for some fun browsing!"}
{"text":"This place has great coffee and a cool retro feel!  The groceries are definitely over-priced but there is a convenience factor in the cost, I'm sure.  The breakfast bar is great for omelettes, etc."}
