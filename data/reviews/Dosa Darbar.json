{"text":"We went there on the off chance that a small South Indian restaurant knew how to make a proper Masala Dosa - and we weren't disappointed! While the ambiance (minimal decor and table prep) left much to be desired, the attentive and polite waitress/cashier/hostess made up for it. We both ordered masala dosas and they came out huge and crispy and hot and delicious. The coconut chutney and sambar are very good. The potato filling inside is savoury and delectable. Despite the appearance of the interior, you really can't beat the price and deliciousness of the dosas. Will be coming back many times for sure!"}

{"text":"The worst place until now I've been to. Sambar and chutneys were so bad that I threw it away in the garbage ... sorry for that but I tried a lot to eat it but was unable to. Usually I don't throw food like this but it was seriously very horrible. Never visited that place again and I'm never going back again."}
{"text":"Again, my son and I are out shopping and decided to have Dosa again.  This time we wanted to go somewhere else to get a different experience.  We arrived later in the afternoon, about 2pm, and the place was empty.  There were two tv's on and music playing, this was nice.  The waiter came immediately to seat us and take our order.  Again, we asked for recommendations and we ended up ordering:   Assorted Vegetable Pakora, House Special Masala Dosa and the House Special Uthapam.  The Pakora arrived quickly (in about 10 minutes) and it was very tasty.  Crispy on the outside and filled with lots of vegetables.  Didn't really like the Ketchup but the corriander chutney was good.  Soon after we received the Dosa.  It was alright, not as good as we've had it, the masala was much chunkier than we like but the taste was good.  Lastly the Uthapam was served.  My son liked it, I didn't.  Personal choice.    Over all it was good, just not as great as we've had before.  We probably won't be back as this place is too far from where we live to get this food.  Probably fine if you live close by."}
