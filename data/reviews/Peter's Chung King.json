{"text":"It's gone!  When I called the posted number ((416) 928-2936) on March 27, 2010, they told me it was now a sushi restaurant!  :("}
{"text":"Peter and Szato - they've been dishing up tasty Szechuan food for me and my family for more than 30 years, when they were upstairs on Spadina.  And we keep going back - that ought to tell you something!  Even though Szato has left, Peter still runs the place and the food hasn't significantly changed in ages (a positive aspect in my books).  Even if the taste is slightly different night to night, it's always good.  My favourites have always been orange beef, garlic shrimp, their \"special noodles\", and dumplings.  Give them a shot, and hopefully you'll agree!  They're also happy to take my entire extended family of ~20 people at one time, with freshly cooked lobster.  Just need to call ahead and order it, then it'll be there, ready for when you want it.  Oh, and their lemon chicken is no longer deep fried - it's stir fried and tangy.  Awesome!  Go!  Get some spicy food and enjoy!"}
{"text":"okay so i might be a whitie who thinks he knows a good chinese restaurant when he eats at one but i am also jewish so that gives me a step up on the competition.  peter's chung king used to just be called chung king and was around where the el mocambo was on college - gotta be at least 25 years ago for sure.  it was owned by a guy named Sito who my dad represented (he was his lawyer).  So we started going there.  Like every sunday night.  And on christmas day like all good jews.  and we ordered the same stuff over and over and over again.  there was maybe 2 or 3 dishes added to the list over the years, probably because of the introduction of vegetarian wives for my brother and i, (thank you thank you) and still with all those veggie dishes its still great (heehee). off the top of my head here's the list:  orange chicken, teriyaki chicken, garlic shrimp, garlic brocoli, special noodles, ginger shrimp, crispy beef, tender beef (sometimes), szechuan shredded beef, hot and sour soup, wonton soup, mooshoo pork (turned to veggie mooshoo care of the veggie wives), spices chicken, potstickers (that was the makeshift name we called them - some kind of pork filled dumpling with some awesome vinegary-like sauce), some kind of green bean dish (sorry that doesnt help) and of course steamed rice.   so there you have it.  pretty much cant go wrong.  just go in, close your eyes, point at the menu and say \"with a diet coke please\", and youre done.  ah, the memories."}
