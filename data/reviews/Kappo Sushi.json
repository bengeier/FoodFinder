{"text":"Newly opened, in the same location as former ND sushi, with much of the same decoration and tableware... came here on a Sunday afternoon, ordered miso soup and an unagi maki, tuna maki, and saba sushi.... soup was warm and yummy, and sushi was delicious, generous portions of fresh fish.. very flavorful. Not cheap, but reasonably priced for a tasty and filling meal. Staff and waitress were friendly and attentive. A good spot for some solid sushi!"}
{"text":"I've tried most places on Baldwin. This place is new so I went to tried it out. The sashimi platter was really good. But the scallop was not as I expected. I don't really like teriyaki sauce. Overall I'd give it five stars. The servers were helpful with the menu."}
{"text":"We had a very tasty dinner here this evening. Everything was good - miso soup, edamame, sunomono salad, mixed tempura, cucumber maki and yam tempura maki."}
{"text":"All the lunch options comes with salad and miso soup, which were nice. We also were served a sort of rice tea, instead of the usual green tea. I had the 11pc assorted nigiri ($15). They note on the menu that all nigiri have wasabi inside, just like how it is done in Japan, so let the server know if you don't want it.  It came with a lot of salmon (4 pc) compared to 1 pc of tuna, which was a bit disappointing. I also saw a photo of scallop from a Yelper, but nope, didn't get that. However all the fish was fresh and the rice was very nice and slightly warm. The eel was sooo good and soft. Quality-wise, would compare with Wow Sushi on Charles St.   My friends had the 7 pc nigiri and 6 pc spicy salmon roll ($14), which they loved. It also seemed to come with the cali roll while the menu says either spicy salmon roll or cali roll. So bonus! And these rolls looked stuffed, so it is an amazing deal and my friends thought it was delicious.   To see lunch menu and prices, refer to Jane B.'s photo from January.   Very nice ambiance inside. A bit dark and there are crates and benches to sit on. The waitress was very kind and attentive. Also brought separate bills without us asking (maybe we looked clearly like poor college students?).   Absolutely would come back."}
{"text":"I had dinner here on Saturday night with my boyfriend and we both agree that this is one of the overall best sushi restaurant in Toronto.   We ordered the uni sushi, sushi & sashimi dinner, orangeville roll and lobster roll to share. The sushi & sashimi dinner was cut thick, incredibly fresh and came with more than enough pieces to share. It also came with a california roll which was shockingly good (we don't normally enjoy california rolls). Both the orangeville and lobster roll were HUGE. If you've had Sushi Bong....the size is comparable but the quality is much, much better. The rolls had plenty of fish and minimal rice. Even the lobster roll had a lot of lobster..I was speechless! We were lucky enough to visit the restaurant when they had an uni special ($5 for 2 sushi). The uni was delicious and we really wanted to order more but was too full :( To top it off, the waitress served us black sesame ice cream on the house.   Service was good and the waitresses were attentive. The restaurant is small, cozy and quiet. I'm guessing that it was not busy because it's a relatively new restaurant and diners have not heard of it yet. It's a shame because the food here is amazing and very well priced. If you're looking for fresh sushi, you really need to check this place out. They also offer 10% off for take out orders if you pay by cash ;)   My boyfriend and I were thinking about this restaurant all day and wanted to come back but was embarrassed that the servers would recognize us. We will try to wait a week before coming back."}
{"text":"I've tried their lunch before, and thought the fish was pretty fresh and it reminded me of the menu from Mi-Ne, especially with the same Orangeville Roll on the menu, and Mi-Ne is one of my go-to sushi places when in doubt. Interestingly, when I asked if they had the same owner as Mi-Ne, I was told \"No\" by the waitress who seemed to have trouble understanding us.  I really wanted to come here for dinner, and came all the way downtown on a Saturday at 7:30PM EST today just to eat here, even checking that they were open from 12-10PM EST on Yelp. To my dismay, it was completely pitch black inside and they were NOT open.  Needless to say, I left disappointed and hungry, with sushi cravings unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Really delicious fresh sushi. I recommend getting the Combi Platter which is a beautiful and generous helping of nigiri, sashimi, and delicious rolls. The ONLY criticism I have of this place is that they are really slow getting food out of the kitchen, so you should really only go if you have a lot of time to spare. The prices are very reasonable for the amount of sushi you get in the Combi Platter."}
{"text":"The best sushi restaurant in downtown Toronto, with such a good prices!  Unlike some sushi place which put lots of rices and less fishes (I.e salmon, unagi ) this restaurant offers sushi with big portion of fishes and veggies in the middle!! I LOVE THAT! Have been there several times, and always feel so satisfied with the food. I will keep hangout with my family and friends there. highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is great, it could use a bigger space as there is a lot of people going to this place. Price on the other hand is a bit pricey but it is quality food. My wife loved the udon that I ordered with the special house sauce cause it was fried, not like the one she ordered which was more soup based. I loved the orangeville roll that we also ordered under the special roll, it was huge and came with 9-10 pieces.   If you upload photos to instagram/facebook and tag their restaurant you do get 2 free soft drinks from them. I would recommend this restaurant to people as it is a great spot to have sushi. Would go back in a few months, not anytime soon."}
{"text":"It was completely empty when we showed up which we were surprised by given the reviews we had read. We really enjoyed our dinner at Kappo sushi. The red dragon roll was really fantastic. Service was outstanding. Price was reasonable for the quality.   The sashimi was good but one piece of tuna was slightly frozen.   Clean restaurant - friendly staff. I'd consider returning."}
