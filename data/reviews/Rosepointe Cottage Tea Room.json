{"text":"This is a great place to get a traditional ladies' tea as well as more substantive food that even my husband enjoys.  Scones with clotted cream, flavorful steeped teas, fresh salads, and rich, homemade soup are mainstays.  These, plus daily sandwich and dessert specials make this restaurant a consistent winner.  I've eaten there a dozen times and everyone I've taken has been delightfully surprised.  Men, take your wife and mother-in-law there is you want to earn brownie points.  The wait staff is friendly-- although service is always \"leisurely\"-- and the setting is intimate.  While you wait for your food you can head upstairs to the quaint gift shop.  However, if you've gotta have carbonated soft drinks or alcohol, this restaurant isn't for you.  Also, the hours are limited so reservations are recommended. 

Update:  I recently visited and the noise level was uncomfortable.  The limited space affords little privacy.  Patrons in the main seating area were sharing medical details, pulling crafts out of bags to pass around the table, and fussing over children out for their first high tea.  Unless we can avoid a busy time, hubby and I have agreed we will-- reluctantly-- have to pass on this restaurant in the future.  Due to this, I've had to downgrade the rating to four stars."}
{"text":"Not for people not in their immediate click group. We drove 35 minutes to get there after seeing good reviews and visiting their Facebook page. We arrived to a very empty restaurant at 11:30 am on Saturday 8/2 and were denied seating and service because they \"are having a shower later today\".... They could've at least posted that on their Facebook page."}
{"text":"Rosepointe Cottage Tea Room is a delight. For the person who gave one star below and future reference for all future patrons, you MUST call ahead and make a reservation if you want to ensure seating. There is a reason it is all booked in advance--It's really good! 

Located in a small century home just off of Chardon square, Rosepointe Cottage is a unique restaurant for this area. NE Ohio is seriously lacking excellent independent restaurants. I make a point of coming here every time I am home for the holidays. Their earl grey la creme tea is always a treat, not to mention their various seasonal dishes and desserts! Scones with clotted cream are a must. 

Parking on the square and in the parking lot down the alley next to the house. Can't miss this!"}
{"text":"I'm a great lover of afternoon tea and this is a sweet place with a friendly atmosphere.  In our party of 5 we all loved the mushroom brie bisque, and the quiches and salads were good. My recommendation is do not order the Welsh rarebit.  It is grainy and served on a piece of wonder bread.  Very disappointing.  The other downside is they need to purchase tea pot warmers as the tea gets cold and there is no offer of additional hot water so by the 2nd cup, the tea is quite tepid.  A very nice experience if you steer clear of the rarebit and don't mind cool tea."}
{"text":"I love coming here when I get the chance, which is rare. The owner, Maryann, is the nicest lady you will meet and always is present to make sure you're comfortable.

The treats are lady like, and so are the entrees, so keep in mind the portion sizes will be lighter. Always get the broccoli salad as an accompaniment (my favorite) and they serve their soups in teacups! So cute. 

The location is a little hard to reach due to the busy intersection by the square. So parking is something to figure out, but worth it. 

Get a pot of tea for the cherry on top."}
{"text":"I come here every chance I get. I love everything about this place from the food to the great service. I've had nearly everything on the menu and I've loved everything. Their soups are great and their deserts are to die for. Twice a year they do a special dinner which is one of the best night's out of the year for me and my girlfriend. I love all the different tea's they have to offer, it's really expanded my knowledge of tea and the flavors that are out there. If I could I'd eat lunch here every day, the portion sizes are perfect for lunch and the quality is second to none. I like to start off with a scone which is always homemade and warm and they are served with a nice jam and cream that makes you want to lick the dish clean. As of late I've been going with the tuna melt and I really enjoy it. I also really like the different specials they have every time I go there. My girlfriend always gets the tea sandwich sampler and it never disappoints. The owner takes great pride in her business and it shows."}
{"text":"I bring my daughters and granddaughters here for a pre school starting tea. 
For the woman who went when they had the shower, they have always encouraged reservations. I call first every year. 
The food is good, the atmosphere special, we all love it"}
