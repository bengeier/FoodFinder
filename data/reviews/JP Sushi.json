{"text":"The sushi was fresh, tasty and had a good rice to filling ratio. We have only done takeout and usually only wait 15 minutes. I'm so glad this place opened up as we were in need of a good sushi spot in the Junction!"}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time. Excellent, fresh fish. Ordered a medium platter and the chef was very accommodating of our request to change a couple of rolls. Will be ordering again."}
{"text":"I eat out everyday because I'm in the home service business,The best sushi I ever had!great service very kind and welcoming,I'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Restaurant is very small with only a few tables. The food is excellent however and very reasonably priced. I had the Sashimi Bento and thoroughly enjoyed it. I will certainly return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome! First time for lunch! $20 fed two. Fresh, simple clean done right.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Have been here three times now, ordered takeout each time. Average wait is 15-20 minutes. Sushi is really fresh and really delicious, also very consistent. This is now my go to sushi spot for the Bloor West/Junction area. I've heard that the chef trained for over a decade in Japan before opening this place. I don't doubt it."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at JP Sushi for the first time.  Ordered the lunch Bento box special along with a side order of Sake Sushi.  The fish tasted very fresh.  The rice was the proper temperature.  Quite tasty.    Yes, seating is limited, but, that's typical of a quality Sushi place. A single Japanese trained sushi chef, cannot be expected to turn out high volume with quality and consistency.  So I don't mind this, as I know it usually means there is better chance of quality control with a smaller crowd.  At the same time, with larger establishments, there is more risk of Sushi not being as fresh as restaurants may over buy during slow times.    The decor is very clean, neat and well designed.  The service was pleasant.  I came near the end of lunch period so there wasn't any crowds to deal with.  Pricing was very reasonable, especially at lunch.  I found out too late, but they even had Toro sushi (tuna belly) available and usually do, which is a nice thing to know for next time.  Most other places I have been to in the GTA have it on the menu, but never have it available.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Finally a sushi joint north along Annette Street!  It's a teeny place with only 3 tables, and I believe they make most of its money by take-out.  It's our family's go-to spot - you must try."}
{"text":"I've visited JP Sushi maybe a total of 10 times when I lived in the area, but only because it is the only japanese/korean restaurant in Annette/Runnymede neighbourhood. They definitely use fresh, high-quality ingredients, but the flavour is rather lacklustre. I've tried a couple of different rolls/platters, udon, pork cutlet, and bento boxes, but everything was just average/below average. Perhaps I have higher standards for sushi as i lived in the downtown core for a really long time. Service could be good or bad depending on the who's serving you. One time a waiter was taking my order and the phone rung, so he just walked away without a word to pick up the phone and left us hanging for a few minutes."}
{"text":"We noticed this sushi restaurant opened up recently close to our home in Bloor West Village/Junction. We ordered take-out for our family and were impressed! The sushi was excellent-fresh, good size portions and reasonable prices. They also had the sushi ready in 20 minutes for pick up. This will be one of our top local sushi places to eat going forward!!!"}
{"text":"The sushi is good and the noodles alright but ultimately too expensive.  There are just too many places with better food and better value for money (see Buddha pie and Westwood grill).  The service is also somewhat inconsistent.  If you really need sushi then this is a good option."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out and I loved it ! The service was sweet and quick. The food was fresh and delicious. Definitely visiting this cute little spot again for sure ! Also very affordable for the area. For sure a place to check out if you're craving some sushi."}
{"text":"Good quality for a small neighbourhood sushi. I had to get a quick lunch before my pottery class (next door) and picked JP. I had salmon sashimi, it was nice and fresh and decorated with \"cucomber tree\". The service was quick, though I would expect at least a smile and a \"thank you\" at the end... oh, well."}
{"text":"This cozy sushi place popped up in the old Mark and Sparky's BBQ restaurant space in a neighbourhood that desperately needed a good sushi restaurant!  Checked it out for lunch last week.  We arrived right at opening at 12pm and ordered the sushi pizza ($6.95), shrimp tempura ($8.95) and 18 piece spicy rolls lunch special ($14.95).  Complimentary green tea came steaming hot!  I was super impressed by the sushi pizza - a thin pizza crust topped with delicate pieces of salmon and white fish with thin slices of avocado!  Elegant but also super tasty.  Shrimp tempura was perfectly deep fried and the spicy rolls were extremely soft and fresh tasting!  JP Sushi has a tiny dining room, probably only seats about 12-14 people so if you go at peak times, there will be a wait.  I've heard from the neighbourhood grapevine that take out orders during peak dinner times can also be a longish wait.  I was still impressed with the food and service.  Will definitely be back for future lunches!"}
{"text":"This place just opened up in a small residential area, and doesn't have a website so I felt a Yelp page was needed for those of us who search forever for online menus.  The dining area is tiny so more suited for takeout - which is what I got.  The experience was fast and friendly!  The fish was fresh and the take out preparation was top notch - it was even presented nicely :).  I got the sashimi dinner which was heavy on the salmon (not a problem for me as I was debating getting the salmon dinner instead haha) and the spicy salmon hand roll (which was stuffed with salmon! Excellent salmon to rice ratio).  The sashimi dinner came with the usual sides - miso soup, salad, rice.  So happy this is in the area now - will solve all locals' sushi cravings."}
{"text":"I have ordered the sushi/sashimi party platters from here as well as ate in on a few occasions. Delicious, fresh, never disappoints. The owner/chef is a friendly humble guy. The service has always been good if only a bit slow during popular times of the day.....when a place is this good, it's worth the wait."}
