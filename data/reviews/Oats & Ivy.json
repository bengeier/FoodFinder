{"text":"I've tried every salad on their menu serveral times and will say the quality and taste is consistently well above what you find at most salad bars. The word 'artisan' comes to mind.  
I would not have the time, patience or culinary insight to pair such intriguing and exotic combinations of ingredients, colours and textures as they do. Without question a hidden gem in Liberty East Village."}
{"text":"I've been anxiously waiting for this place to open and I finally got a chance to go today. I had their Asian noodles for lunch and it was so delicious and filling that I went to grab dinner there later on: chicken and kale soup with corn bread and maple butter on the side. Yummmmm! Will definitely be back very very soon!"}
{"text":"So close to my place and vegetarian. Had so much hope, but pasta in my meal was under-cooked. They were stuck together and totally ruined the experience. Great staff and very friendly, so I'll likely give it another shot."}
{"text":"I was a bit hesitant to eat here initially because I didn't think it would be very flavourful however, I took a chance and popped in. I ended up ordering the blueberry smoothie and it was absolutely delicious. I also ordered the Asian noodles and it was very flavourful and loved that it was also spicy. I do have to say like all the other reviews it is pricey but a nice treat."}
{"text":"Great little spot in Liberty Village. I got the Asian Noodle lunch box and it was very tasty. Staff was friendly and patient with me. Only real downside is not a lot of seating and it's a little pricy, but not too bad. Great lunch spot to get something to go!"}
{"text":"I'm home sick today and needed something healthy but flavorful...this did the trick. I got the Thai Slaw bowl and the walking on sunshine juice. Talk about a freshness explosion. The taste is great! I'm so impressed. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Food is good but pricey and they never have any of the salad rolls. Waited 20 minutes for one of the box lunches and nowhere to sit outside. Maybe nice for people to have tables and chairs so they can eat their food. Oh ya, can you open on Sundays at least in the summer?"}
{"text":"I work in the area so I decided try out Oats and Ivy for lunch.  I had the Asian Noodle lunch box and added chicken.  It was very good and a nice healthy and fresh alternative for lunch.  The service was friendly and fast.

The only downside is that it is very expense.  With tax it was just over $17 and I didn't even order a drink.  Very expensive for takeout and while it was very yummy the serving size was not very big for the price.

If money is no object - go for it but I work in non-profit so I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Had a chance to try their box salads at the Union Summer Market. Opted for the Thai Slaw. Great textures, nice flavour with a perfect balance of ingredients. A perfect lunch meal for a hot summer day. Great stuff!"}
{"text":"I am a very strict vegetarian and was so pleased to learn about this place but I am crushed with disappointment; most bland food I have ever eaten. Healthy, yes. Worth eating, NO.  It gives vegetarian food a bad name.  It was outrageously expensive, as well."}
{"text":"Great healthy food, a bit pricey but I ordered the Moroccan salad and it was bigger than i expected. Great for Liberty village to have some healthy quick options. $8.45 for a smoothie is ridiculous in my opinion but the salad was worth the $10.50  I'll be going back"}
{"text":"I ordered the Thai Slaw through Uber Eats today for lunch, and it was absolutely delicious, filling, and fresh. Highly recommended!"}

I came here with a friend last month because she just moved near liberty village and we wanted to try out some of the healthy places they had to offer!

Oats & Ivy was a cool spot but very tiny and very limited amount of seats. We weren't interested in doing take out as we were going to the gym nearby after, but luckily there were some seats available for us. 

We both got the mushroom soup which was delicious and shared a salad. I forget which salad it was but it had squash and some type of cheese. I didn't expect cheese because I thought the place was vegan but oh well!

Overall the food was very good but a little pricey considering the portions."}
