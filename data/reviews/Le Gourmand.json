{"text":"I crave their chocolate chip cookies. I look forward to the days when I have meetings with creative agencies spread across this area. I admit I was a skeptic the first time I saw them, after all they look almost like giant muffin tops. The edges are crispy and sugary and the middle is soft and buttery. Chocolate chunks run throughout. To borrow from Philly Cream Cheese - they're a little taste of heaven."}
{"text":"I have worked in the area for years and tried a number of lunch items. Everything always tastes very homemade and high quality!   Soups are always delicious - Carrot ginger is a favourite, and they always come with a piece of bread for dipping. Cobb salad is excellent, they are pre prepared but come with a creamy and tangy blue cheese dressing on the side. Quiche with greens - my favourite lunch which I get fairly often from Le Gourmand. They always have 2 or 3 types (ham and cheddar, goat cheese and roasted veg, smoked salmon and dill are all common options). With greens it comes to 6.99 which is well worth it, the pastry is flaky and buttery and the portion size is very fair.  They also always have hot lunch specials (lasagna, curries, meatloaf etc.) and a range of sandwiches that can be put in a panini press.  Finally you can't go without grabbing a cookie, particularly the chocolate chip w/walnut are the best cookies in the city without a doubt. I think they're around $2ea but I would pay 3 no problem. They are crispy outside and gooey inside just like you would attempt to make at home but fail!   Give it a go if you're in the area, they also have a nice little patio area on Spadina."}
{"text":"still LOVE le gourmand, but i have to admit that i've had better pastries in this wonderful city of food...and that the pain au chocolat is much better at rahier.  their pastry is pretty much consistently...perfect.  i'm still a big fan of the almond & chocolate croissants, but can't deny that perfection exists...elsewhere!"}
{"text":"My favourite things at Le Gourmand are the weekend brunches and the Chocolate bombs. The service is always friendly and they try to accommodate any special needs.  I just wish they had more vegetarian options for dinner. I know they say they do, but other than salads and wraps, there are no real vegetarian choices."}
{"text":"So since my last review we've been to the restaurant twice and I still find it a bit hit and miss.  What's good is really good, but when it's not it's very disappointing, particularly at those prices.    We had crab cakes which were excellent with nice crispy exteriors and light, fluffy and flavorful interiors.  They were served with chipotle mayonnaise with just the right amount of heat to complement and not overwhelm the delicate crab taste.  I Also tried their appetizer of \"escargots bourgogne\" which were escargots and mushrooms lightly braised in wine (just like beef bourgogne) and topped with a piece of smoked bison belly which was advertized as \"bacon\".  The escargot were a little overwhelmed by the wine sauce and the braising didn't do much for their texture.  The saving grace was the bison belly which was braised right along with the escargot and mushrooms and was spectacular.  I could have eaten a larger piece as a main course.  It was loaded with flavor and was soft and luscious as a braised piece of belly should be.  They do themselves a disservice simply referring to this as a bacon topping in the menu!! I've also sampled two mains - the venison which was beautifully cooked and presented in a lovely reduction.  It was venison as venison is meant to be served.  I also had the \"duck two ways\", which was a duck confit and duck breast.  The breast was delicious and again cooked perfectly and served with a mashed potato with a little parsnip that was heavenly - the two vegetables were beautifully balanced together..  The confit however was disappointingly hard and lacked any skin or crispiness so a real disappointment.  My wife had a risotto which was very average. At both meals I asked for wine recommendations - the first was spot on and the second very disappointing so also a little hit and miss."}
{"text":"Gourmand is an essential institution and the quality of the food (excellent) is not in question but they never have fixed the service issue. With no particular rush my latte takes over 10 minutes to make and a breakfast croissant takes 20 minutes to appear, despite the fact that they sit in a tray ready to heat. More staff in the front office would help and maybe a sense of some urgency from the cashier."}
{"text":"The rating is solely for their chocolate chip cookies. I have only tried two things from their menu: the chocolate chip cookies and chocolate chip walnut cookies. They are the best cookies of their kind that I have ever had. They put huge chunks of chocolate into their soft, chewy batter. Le gourmand certainly doesn't skimp on the walnuts either. Simply delicious.   Tip: come early for the cookies as they run out often and you'll have to wait a good 25min for the next batch."}
{"text":"This review is based purely on customer service alone.  My experience was as followed.   I walked into Le Gourmand and asked for an item on their menu. A chicken sandwich, I believe.  The response from the person behind the counter was... \"Yea, that ain't gonna happen.\"  Which I felt was the wrong way to tell me that you were out of a sandwich.  Maybe you could try suggesting a different sandwich, or even saying \"oh, sorry sir, [or dude, man, guy], but we ran out of that...\"  So with an \"Ok, peace!\", I walked over to Subway, got a sandwich and brought it back to eat in Le Gourmand, with my friend David Bowie, who was lucky enough to have his selection available.   First impressions are a bitch. I doubt I will ever go back."}
{"text":"I stopped  in randomly since it was on the walk back to my hostel. Looked pretty nice, so why not?  I asked if they served iced coffee since I didn't see it on the menu anywhere. The cashier said \"We do iced Americanos\", which was fine by me, it's actually preferred. What was not fine was the amount of condescension in her voice and on her face as she said it. If I wanted crappy customer service, I'd go to Starbucks.  Look, I get that iced coffee isn't a favorite of baristas or coffee afficianados of any sort. They're not my favorite either, but they're refreshing on a hot day, moreso than my usual order of an Americano and iced tea isn't really my thing. But regardless of what's being ordered, you should give good customer service. It's not like I was holding up a line or anything, I was the only one waiting to be served.  I would take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Decent baked goods but not a huge selection. Happen to run into a bitchy server with bad attitude from grabbing a cookie to paying."}
{"text":"The walnut chocolate chip cookie is amazing! It's soft and gooey. I also tried a macchiato and it was good. It's a spacious location with plenty of seating. I'm not sure how the food is but if you have a craving for a cookie, it's a place you should try."}
{"text":"Had the butter chicken burrito for lunch and, well, I'm adding this place to my regular rotation. Food was gourmet! But the price was fast-food reasonable (in line with Queen west). Also, the atmosphere was lively and laid back enough that you could have a conversation without the whole joint hearing your every word."}
{"text":"I love the location of Le Gourmand. I visit it every time I have a still-life drawing across the street at 401 Richmond to stock up on a fancy cake and pulled coffee before I head into class. Their pastries are mouth-watering, with crispy shells and light centers,  very much how real French pastries ought to be by law. Although their pricing is on average 50 cents more than what you'd pay at Clafouti or Nadege, their location makes them special. You won't be able to find a tastier, crispier croissant in the entire neighborhood."}
{"text":"Good food, great desserts (chocolate chip cookies are insanely good like everyone else says), good coffee, and it's nice space that feels like a bustling European cafe. Whether it be a pick-me-up or bringing treats for friends, Le Gourmand is always my first choice to go and grab something. It can get busy during lunch time but the line always moves fast and you get your food quickly."}
{"text":"This is a great little cafe. I went there with a friend one morning and was pleasantly surprised by the amazing variety of pastries they offered. They also have ones if the best vanilla chai lattes I have ever had.  Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a light snack and some great coffee or chai lattes.   I think the offer other light food as well such as sandwiches. They have a little patio out front that is nice in the summer.   Prices are reasonable and the service has been excellent every time I've been there."}
{"text":"The salads are really good, I usually get the nicoise. The cappuccino is hit or miss depending on who is making it. Had a medium one today that was all milk and no espresso! Disappointment."}
{"text":"This review is for the breakfast menu.  The bakery items, including the freshly baked chocolate chip cookies, deserve 4 stars.  They were simply fantastic.  However, I would assign 2 stars for other menu items such as eggs, breakfast buritto, bagels  and coffee/tea.  The chocolate chip cookies were irresistibly chewy and chock-full of gooey chocolate.  The chocolate croissant were flaky with a generous sprinkling of chocolate.  These were great accompaniments with coffee (average) and tea (tea bag !).   We ordered the mushroom and cheese omlette which was fluffy, but the mushroom and cheese seemed to be thrown in as an afterthought instead of being cooked along with the omlette.  The smoked salmon and cream cheese bagel was 'over grilled' and thought it was overpriced at $7.  Ambiance was nice but did not find staff particularly friendly nor rude.  To sum it up, I would come back for the bakery items and skip everything else."}
{"text":"I've been a frequent customer of Le Gourmand over the years and it used to be my regular weekend spot for breakfast, coffee, treats for friends, etc. unfortunately their latest closure and reemergence has resulted in a zero value proposition for their customers. No one working there now seems to know what they are doing. During my last visit, my request to put a rush on placing my sandwich on the grill was met with hotty stares of indignation - it seems the cashier doesn't touch the food but just works the cash. Normally I have pretty mild expectations of service in a coffee place but the amount of time it has taken to receive my last few food orders has been incredible - truly almost hard to believe. 18 minutes for breakfast for my husband and I; 7 minutes to receive a grilled sandwich that was already prepared and just needed to be grilled. This is all disappointing because the food is actually very good but the lack or organization to actually receive the food takes away from the enjoyment of it. I hope they can get their act together; the Starbucks two doors down is only too happy to steal customers from a neighborhood establishment."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great atmosphere and attentive service. My favourite restaurant on the West Island.  The coffee-encrusted filet mignon is a must!"}
{"text":"This cafe is an awesome spot in city to go for coffee and obviously their cookies! I was lucky enough to get their cookies fresh out of the oven and it was so good. It's the perfect place to go for a date or just to sit and hang out."}
{"text":"I award 5 stars purely for their chocolate chip cookies!!! wowza. I treat myself on weekends to really good quality sweets.  Since I have moved here (1 year now), I have fallen into a bit of a chocolate chip cookie tasting spree around the city. Hands down, Le Gourmand's chocolate chip cookie (and the nut (almond?)) one too.  They also make an almighty good Americano Misto.   I'd love the recipe for those cookies.  It may be dangerous though!    My friend had the breakfast wrap one morning too - I had a bite and it was faaabulous.  I also got her a cookie to try. She ate half (they're huge) and isnt a sweet tooth but she enjoyed it.  I'm not going to lie...I polished off the rest of hers (after mine!).  I wish they opened earlier during the week in Summer (6am ideally)."}
{"text":"We held our company Christmas dinner here with fourteen seated at our table. Without exception we found the food delicious and the service impeccable.  Wonderful setting made for  a wonderful evening. Thank-you."}
{"text":"Good food choices but the cashiers working had no clue about their own brunch menu. When asked questions they had to ask each other what the ingredients were. This Restaurant should train their employees to know their own menu."}
{"text":"Despite several negative comments on YELP, I figured I would check out Le Gourmand for lunch today. I didn't have a chance to savour their famous cookies or coffee, but, I did grab a grilled beef sandwich. I have to say, that first bite was delicious, as it had the perfect amount of cheese and beef! I've heard so much about the \"crazy\" prices they charged, but, I was actually impressed with the $8.76 the meal cost (sandwich and bottle of water). Believe it or not, that's waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay cheaper than some of the places in the area where it can cost as much as $13 for, essentially, the same thing. Even though I was by myself, it looks like it would be a great place to meet up with friends/colleagues (there's even a decent sized patio, if you want to catch some rays while eating your meal).  Anyways, it was my first time, and definitely won't be my last time. When I do venture back, I'm definitely trying one those cookies I've read (and heard) so much about! (I'm scoring this a 4, because I only had the sandwich and I'd like to sample some of their other goods before I move it to a 5!)   One tip - Like any place in this area, you need to get there a bit early, or later, to avoid the chaotic lunchtime rush."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great Chili, love the coffee. Great place to go. They also have non-dairy food options."}
{"text":"I was always intimidated to go into this place at lunch and now that I've recently been on the prowl for delicious soups in the area, it's forcing me to man up. I've yet to conquer this place, soup-wise but I did manage to confront the legend of the their famous chocolate chip cookies (I use the term \"cookie\" loosely).  This mammoth cookie is a little more than an inch thick and had the rough circumference of my face. I had to eat it in 5 Acts like a Shakespearean tragedy.   But did it taste good? *sigh* It did. Perfectly buttery and the right kind of cookie crumbly FULL of chocolate chips.  And here's where it fails and it's the same reason why I'm reluctant to bake face-sized cookies at home: Because it's so big, to get it baked perfectly through the center, you'll have to sacrifice the edges which were crispier than I like my cookies. Quality over size, people! Quality over size.  Le Gourmand may be building a following for their Chocolate Chip Cookie but the true winner of their baked goods is the  Dark Chocolate Ganache Filled Ball of Sinful Heaven (patent on name pending). Talk about quality over size, this dome of chocolatey goodness is ready to burst with quality... and chocolate! My goodness..."}
{"text":"This place has a tonne of potential. It's a great spot to pick up an authentic croissant, a hearty chocchip cookie, or to use the ladies' room in a pinch. (No 'for customers only' sign here ! Win!)  Eating in is another sh*t show altogether. The plates are grimy (!) and the sit down drinks portions are overpriced. A \"Belgian\" hot chocolate sets you back $4 for 8oz.. When asked about the price the reply was \" we only use the highest quality chocolate\". They must sprinkle it in like magic dust right at the end because my hot chocolate was a pale grey and it tasted like a cup of warm milk.  So my chocolate craving goes unsatisfied  but I AM ready for my sippy cup and a nap.  In a world of many options I would bypass this place completely. But in an area sorely lacking in pastry shops I feat I will set foot in Le Gourmand yet again."}
{"text":"Good, not great. Beautiful building. Ordinary service. Prices are reasonable. A better choice than those strip mall parking lot terraces. Has a nice lunch menu."}
{"text":"Bacon-wrapped duck appetizer was out of this world. Lamb curry was divine. I want to go back to eat here every day. Loved everything about this place."}
{"text":"True, I've never actually stepped foot in any of their locations BUT last week I was hand-delivered a handful of their nookie cookies and a chocolate chip cookie by my mans, so, that counts for something.  A nookie cookie consists of a ball of warm, gooey fudge coated in icing sugar. This sugar coating hardens while baking and cracks open in your mouth to unleash a delectable sludge of warm chocolate. I wanted to bury my face in these cookies and weep for the joy they have brought into my life.   The chocolate chip cookie was as wide as my face and two inches thick. Size matters. Semisweet chocolate matters. I feasted on that sucker for two days.  I'm looking forward to making a trip in person to check out their soups but more importantly: mama needs more fudge."}
{"text":"I only order one item there. The croissant egg, cheese, and bacon breakfast sandwich grilled (for a bargain price of $4.75 before tax).  Its the best breakfast sandwich i've ever had in my life. Not to sound like i'm exaggerating.  I've been there 6 times in the past three months. I bought several daily deal groupon and even had two of these breakfast croissants in one sitting at the risk of sounding greedy and gluttoneous.  I've had their prosciutto and brie/pesto. It was ok, but nothing spectacular like the sandwiches you can get at Pusateri's in Yorkville.  I have also tried their carrot ginger soup which was pretty good. Their regular coffee is ok.  If not for convenience i'd rather go to starbucks or second cup to be honest.   The restaurant itself is a order, take a number/take a seat or take it to go type setting. The staff is polite and friendly but don't go out of their way to build any strong rapport with the customers.  I can see why this place is a hit or miss.  Their prices are premium and unless you are there for their specialties, you might feel disappointed.  7/25/2011 update...just tried the eggs benedict over the weekend. It was very tasty.  I also discovered they have a great double medium Americano for $2.20.  I also don't get the difference between their small and medium size cup.  The small is super tiny (smaller than a short at Starbucks), and the medium is like a Venti."}
{"text":"You have not lived until you have been here. The chocolate chip cookies are a must. Go for the veggie and brie panini. This place is adorable and is always good. The beet salad and beef chili is next level amazing.   But seriously.. If you do nothing else with the rest of your life just go get the cookie! It's a game changer."}
{"text":"Great cookies but everything else isn't so good. The service is also incredibly slow. Don't recommend it unless you want to wait forever."}
{"text":"I ate here last weekend because a friend had a brunch Groupon. Even without that, it was extremely good value. I got the chili and it was pretty great. My only complaint is that they don't give out enough bread, just two tiny chunks that resemble a garnish more than a ... side? Either way, I am a huge whore for bread and they were definitely rationing it out.  Like everyone else has said, the cookies ARE.INSANE. Between four of us we actually managed to sample the freshly baked chocolate souffle, the chocolate chip cookies AND the peanut butter cookies. The souffle (the first I've ever had -- sheltered, I know) was divine. It's a cakey consistency, but then it melts in your mouth like some kind of heaven-sent pudding... PUDDING. The chocolate chip cookies were hot from the oven and as thick as a phone book. I was half-expecting there to be something in there (fudge, nutella, a kinder egg toy?) but nope, just cookie, chocolate chips, chocolate chips and more chocolate chips. I can't comment on the peanut butter cookies (excuse me while I vomit at the thought), but apparently they were, rather surprisingly, the lightest of all three.  I'll definitely go again. Minus one star because when our drinks were ready, no one brought them to our table or called us up to collect them. They just sat there on the counter. When we finally went up and asked, they were almost cold. Boo!!  I have a lunch date to go here tomorrow, so I'm hoping I can update this to a five star review. I'll have to check for consistency with those cookies, though. Obviously."}
{"text":"One of my favourite hangouts and takeout places. Great breakfast - croissants, coffee and omelettes. Yummy sandwiches, quiche and salads for lunch. The roast beef sandwich with caramelized onions is my fave. And yes...those cookies - to die for. They also carry a great selection of high quality chocolate bars and other high end grocery items.  My only beef is their hours - closed relatively early (7 on weekdays, 6ish on weekends)"}
{"text":"Omg! I finally just tried the choc. chip walnut cookies and they're to die for!! Definitely worth the $3. I would definitely buy and share w someone next time bcs they are huge. I sent my husband in to pick up a few and he came home w 4. Yum. Lucky me....but I'll have the 2nd tomorrow for breakfast w my coffee. Too rich to eat two in a day! Lol"}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this place. I love their green bean, prosciutto and salmon salad and hate everything else. Everything. Well except the cute little cafe feel the place has.   I work right around the corner from this place and have been in there countless times and two things remain the same everytime, the prices are too high for the quality of food and portion size they sell and the attitude that comes with ordering is so off putting I've stopped eating there altogether. I guess I'll have to learn to make my own salad."}
{"text":"Le Gourmand has great tasting pastries, especially their cookies. They offer an assortment of high-quality and good tasting breakfast, lunch, and dinner options, you can find a full menu listing on their website.    I recommend trying an almond croissant and/or their grilled prosciutto sandwich.  It's a good hang-out place, lots of seating, nice atmosphere.  They have a side-walk patio which is great in warm weather."}
{"text":"After a year long study, I am prepared to deliver the definitive guide to Le Gourmand:  1. The cookies are phenomenal.  They're worth the hassle it takes to get one.  Seriously.    2. The food is actually pretty amazing too.  Highlights include their baguette sandwiches, breakfast sandwiches (on croissant), butter chicken, meatloaf, and quiche.  Skip anything that comes in a wrap.  Not worth it.  All of the croissants are great.  3. Stick to espresso based beverages.  The drip coffee is watery at best, but the lattes and cappuccinos are quite delightful.  4. Disregard all signs and just order wherever you see a person standing behind a cash register.  Is there an actual single-file line in front of that cash register?  Okay good, stand in that line.  Ignore the swaths of people milling about in front of the sandwiches.  They're just hungry and confused and wondering if someone else has stolen their lunch.  Avoid anyone who looks confused - they'll just drag you into the vortex of confusion.  5. Avoid 'grilled' sandwiches.  They take forever and aren't worth the hassle.  6. Do not order any coffee larger than a medium.  Their stir sticks won't reach the bottom of the large cups.  7. Try to not patronize Le Gourmand before 10AM or between 12PM-2PM because this is when the grumpy hungry people attend en masse.    8. Actually, avoid Saturdays too.  The tourists are more confused than regular people.  9. If your order takes longer than ten or fifteen minutes during a non-peak period, feel free to ask someone about it's whereabouts.  I have determined that there is a 12% chance of part or all of your order being forgotten, stolen, or misplaced.  I hope that was helpful."}
{"text":"Best patio restaurant on West Island - and wonderful ambience in winter - and  great food to boot - always a treat to get to go here..."}
{"text":"Miss Starbucks on the corner and come here for a Parisian experience - good lattes and espresso with a cookie to tide you over."}
{"text":"Great cookies, great food and atmosphere. Definitely recommend coming here for lunch. They've got some pretty neat lunch specials and great coffee to go with it."}
{"text":"I'm sad to give Le Gourmand a bad review as they have the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever had. However, when a colleague and I stopped by for lunch today I couldn't believe the service we received. I decided to get a peanut butter cookie and she ordered lunch.  The board clearly said that the Barbecue Chicken came with roasted red potatoes and coleslaw. An employee set my colleague's plate on the ledge saying it was ready. They had put mashed potatoes on the plate instead of red potatoes. My colleague kindly mentioned this and asked for red potatoes instead.  The employee at Le Gourmand angrily started mouthing off, grabbed the plate, tossed the chicken and potatoes back in the hot table and then threw the plate hard into the dish pit. She then huffed and puffed while she made my colleague a new plate. She slammed it back down on the counter and didn't even acknowledge my colleague let alone apologize to her. Absolutely baffled by this service. Do not treat your customers with such disrespect when they have done nothing wrong but order from the menu and expect to get what they ordered."}
{"text":"--- SUMMARY ---   What is it: coffee shop, pastries, sandwiches; sells imported jams and other treats as well.

{"text":"I really want to love you Gourmand.  Your food is amazing, space attractive...but the service is soooo horrible I leave with a sour taste in my mouth.   Here's a tip...instead of micromanaging the one employee who paid any attention to me (both asking for my order then later making it) when everyone else (including the manager) left their stations after looking at me and my order chits, try instead to muster up some interest in good service.  I don't get it... Are you above your customers?  Thank god for Cole, the lone guy actually paying any attention to doing a good job. The rest of you are tragic in your indifference..."}
{"text":"If you know how to use this place it's great. Don't come expecting a waited-on elaborate meal. This is a grab and go spot with some tables you can post up at.  What to order 1. Chocolate chip cookies 2. Breakfast wrap 3. Panini 4. Specials"}
{"text":"I purchased a chocolate chip cookie as I heard it was the best in town and I was not disappointed. It looked like it was going to be crunchy (which I am not a fan of) but it was actually just a little crisp on the outside, but so ooey gooey and amazing on the inside. Giving 4 stars purely because I find the place to be a little bit expensive for my budget, but you get what you pay for and it is DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"So... I don't know what they put in their Spiced Chai Latte (with almond milk-nom) but it is ADDICTIVE. I mean seriously addictive.   Might be the best Chai Latte I've had outside of David's Tea. You should give it a try!"}
{"text":"It's always a happy day when I head over the Le Gourmand for my first cup of coffee. I can rarely pass up one of their killer croissants ala egg and cheese.   Also, the lunch menu is a solid spread of all things delicious. I'm something of a sandwich snob. If I'm eating roast beef I want it to be succulent and almost melt in my mouth like premium beef sashimi. The salad selection is top notch - I love the beet salad. They also have daily specials that I imagine being crafted by a chubby cherub specializing in comfort food; meatloaf, baked macaroni and cheese, and selections of quiche.   And of course, I have to mention the cookies. They are amazing - that's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Nice coffee place with amazing cookies. Crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. They also have a section where they sell cookies and coffee for you to take home. Staff is nice too."}
{"text":"Sunday morning and I was a woman on a mission!   Had time to kill before brunch and I was determined to have one of the infamous chocolate chip cookies at Le Gourmand. After a few visits with no luck I figured Sunday morning 10:30 am was prime time to hit the jackpot! Gold! Cooookies! The sweet aroma of chocolate- my day was made!  Service: the wait was long, very long! Seemed to be more bodies wandering aimlessly rather than helping kill the line that kept growing as the minutes ticked away.  Cookies: I saw a whole tray of cookies cooling probably never make it to the display case. Finally got around to being served, let's just say I grabbed more than I'd like to admit- umm to share of course and the lady behind me cleared the rest of them out. Sold out in minutes. They do bake throughout the day but don't last- hope that you have luck on your side when you go.  This is everything a cookie should be- warm, crispy edges, moist, chewy, gooey, chocolatey, buttery without being greasy and the home baked goodness you wish you could whip up but have yet to turn on a oven. Lets talk about size- the bigger the better! Ideally a cookie this size should be shared but you just can't stop eating it.   My journey continues as I pack on the pounds..."}
{"text":"The Nutella hot chocolate was lovely and creamy and rich but sadly only one size. It was beautiful on a cold, rainy day. The brownie was meh, top was a tad dry but still decent flavor.  Bit of a young crowd here when I stopped by.  Also pricey as small Nutella hot chocolate and a brownie was nearly  $10.  Ouch."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 8/10 Food: 7/10 Atmosphere: 7.5/10 Service: 8/10  Let's get one thing straight, the cookies ARE fantastic. This review is about my breakfast/brunch experience rather than the already-well-known chocolate-chip-goodness.  The food, service, and environment are fine/good. Honestly, it's nice to have an option in the city where you are not going to have to wait 1.5-2 hours for a decent breakfast during weekend prime times.   THE BOTTOM LINE: a fine alternative for breakfast/brunch if you don't feel like waiting for other quintessential Toronto brunch places."}
{"text":"This place really do have fantastic cookies! My chocolate chip cookie was devoured in seconds! I'm so glad I picked it up when paying for the Bombay Mac & Cheese, which was not impressive.   It was the special of the day, but the dish was lukewarm and lacked flavor. It tasted more like watered down curry pasta rather than Mac and cheese.  Service was A-Ok. Cashier was brisk as would any other takeout place. There are a couple of tables for dining in but most customers were getting take out.  Though the cooked food isn't too great, I will certainly be back to have more of those amazing cookies!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast with my sister this past weekend.  She order the veggie omelette and I had their regular breakfast of two eggs and bacon.  The veggie omelette was a regular sized porition that was accompanied with a slice of a baguette, greens and fruit salad.  My sister was still hungry after her meal.  My breakfast was ok.  The bacon was super crunchy, almost dried.  I made a mini egg sandwich with the eggs and baguette slices that came with my meal.  Value for money for breakfast was ok, we ended up spending $22 for the both of us.  There are other breakfast places were you can get a lot more food.  Their coffee is great though!"}
{"text":"I went to Le Gourmand after hearing them win a large cookie competition.  So my expectations were high going in, and man, I was not disappointed.  I tasted 5 of their cookies, and 1 of their souffles (not at 1 time haha - my stomach would explode).  Every bit of anything they make is like a taste of heaven. You forget everything in the world - that's how good everything tastes. Even though it's their chocolate chip cookie that won the award, and made them famous, everything I tried was incredible.  The only place where they lost a point is on washroom cleanliness. I've only been to their washroom once, so maybe it's not a reflection of how it usually is, but that one time I went, it wasn't very clean (it wasn't horrible, either). But if you're just getting your cookie to go, that's not really a factor."}
{"text":"Best place for warm walnut chocolate chip cookies. Also their lattes are delicious. All the their baked goods are good. Their sandwiches are also good."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee and breakfast wraps and baked goods. Pretty busy so just make sure to budget time for the line."}
{"text":"So yummy!! The melty chocolate chip cookies and sandwiches keeps me coming back. Their coffee is mediocre. I suggest only getting their sandwiches and pastries. They are freshly baked and there's a lot of variety to choose from on most days. Can't get enough of their butter croissants! So delishh!"}
{"text":"Gourmand has THE best cookie on the planet. (It's more of a cake really) It's sort of like the mystery of how they get the caramilk into the caramilk bar - how do they infuse so much chocolate inside that damn cookie?  If you're looking for something a little less sweet and a little more substantial, try the avocado tomato sandwich (grilled or not) it's amazing. (Vegans: There is cheese). I end up caving in and getting one of these bad boys 2-3 times a month, SO good.   The staff is friendly, especially with familiar faces. I strongly recommend popping by!"}
{"text":"Went here for Brunch on Sunday around 11 and it was a disaster. They were out of everything we wanted to order. First we tried to order French toast and pancakes, out of both. Running out of French Toast I can sort of understand, maybe they ran out of the specific bread used in the dish, but pancakes???? Um, that's just flour, eggs and milk, which any kitchen should have and should be able to whip up some more. It makes you wonder if instead of fresh homemade pancakes they are using some store bought premix...Next we tried to order a breakfast croissant sandwich, and again...they are 'out' they apparently sold the last one right before we ordered. But they have croissants, they have eggs, and they have bacon, just not together...I guess they were incapable of putting them together in a new sandwich. I left with the impression that this French cafe was just a fancy grab and go where everything is premade and heated up. God forbid they run out of the premade stock as the kitchen seems incapable of making anything from scratch. My advice go early or prepare to be disappointed..."}
{"text":"Le Gourmand once had \"conditional pass\" sign in the Window. Minus one star... The croissants are not the best in town, but are good. Coffee is great. In the winter, it might be too hot and in the summer, it might be too cold. There are temperature issues anyway. Treats galore- fancy desserts and cookies to die for."}
{"text":"This review is for their cookies. All of the food I've had here has been really good (croissants, muffins, soups, paninis, baguette sandwiches, etc.) and their coffees are pretty awesome too.  But the five stars goes solely to their cookies.  Soft on the inside, crumbly on the outside, and lots and lots of chocolate chips. When I came in today, the cookies were actually fresh from the oven... Yumm!   The only downside - a chocolate chip cookie costs over $2! If only it came with a free glass of milk..."}
{"text":"Hands down, without a doubt THE best chocolate chip cookie this city has to offer. Not too sweet, not too chocolately. Get it freshly baked. Prepared foods are meh."}
{"text":"The one item that keeps me coming back for more... Their Amazing Chocolate Chip Cookie!!! I don't care if each cookie is about $3... They're huge! I've bought dozens to get my friends and family hooked on it. And once you taste the soft uber chocolatey cookie... It is So Worth It! I've had their croissants and souffle and they're pretty legit too. They also serve warm food and salads but the chocolate chip cookie is the lunch of Champions!  I can't give full stars to Le Gourmand only because they don't have a stock of chocolate chip cookies at all times. They are super popular and oh sooo Awesomely Fresh that they get snatched up pretty quick right out of the oven.  Call ahead to check if they have any on hand or just order a few dozen for next day pick up. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I was told that their chocolate chip cookies are delicious. Were they delicious, you ask? They were mouthwatering, finger licking good. The chocolate cookie was so moist and chewy. The outsides of the cookie was just the right amount of crispiness. The chocolate was still melted and the dough was so soft and rich. I would definitely recommend their cookies! They were reasonable priced, $2.65 plus tax for a cookie. I got a cookie at Second Cup and it cost me $3 and Starbucks' cookies are $1.95 without tax. They also have other baked goods that look really good!"}
{"text":"Short and sweet (like their cookies) this review is just about that - their glorious, famous, well reviewed cookies (and why in the sweet f&%k I have never had them - seriously?!!? Where have these been all my life)?   I met up with my new cookie expert yelp pal Sol O on his recco that this was THE spot for a mid-day cookie hangout, so we did it up.   I got a single (walnut free) chocolate chip cookie and it was insane! Warm inside still somehow, soft inside with a little crust all over the outside. Each bite was gooey and sweet, and ... and....magical (hearts over eyes emoji).  I had top escape as fast as possible because I knew if I stayed much longer I'd destroy their entire inventory and then I'd be fat-shaming myself for days to come.  Never been to LG? You should, they're well known for other things but do yourself a favour come for the cookies.  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"This is cookie heaven. Most notable is their giant chocolate chip cookies which are miraculously always fresh and still warm from the oven no matter what time of day you stop in. Also noteworthy is the \"nookie cookie\", smaller in size, this bite-sized chocolate cookie is covered in icing sugar and is probably what people have in mind when they say woman prefer chocolate to sex...  oh, also they make good sandwiches, soups and salads."}
{"text":"Terrible service and less than spectacular food/coffee. Chocolate chip cookies are the only thing they have going for them."}
{"text":"If you're planning on getting a regular drip coffee, get in a to-go paper cup. Last time I ordered a medium but their porcelain cups are wayyyyy smaller, like half the size of the paper cups."}
{"text":"The hype is real!!!  After reading so many reviews about their chocolate chip cookie, I just knew I had to go and get one.  I went early in the morning to ensure that I wouldn't miss out.  At that time, I was pretty much the only person in the cafe.  And there was a whole tray of cookies.    I bought one and it is huge and very thick!  When I broke it in half, the chocolate pieces were still melty.  The outside is crisp while the inside is still slightly gooey.  One bite and I was hooked!  The caramel flavor of the butter and brown sugar comes through in every bite, the chocolate pieces are plentiful without overpowering the cookie, and that super soft center is so good.  I went right back to the counter to contemplate one of the great questions in life - do I buy one more cookie or do I buy two?!  After much deliberation, I went for it and bought two more.  And I do not regret it one bit because these are literally the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever had anywhere.  For $3.50/cookie, it's quite reasonable considering the size and especially the quality.  Make sure you hit this place up!"}
{"text":"Great cookies, pastries and coffee...not so good service. Needs to be friendlier and faster, and different quality of steamed milk depending on who's working. It's SO hit and miss here"}
{"text":"The best gooey warm cookies in the city. Go with choc walnut. Also the hot chocolate is decent. Great selection of jams and boxed imported biscuits and cookies."}
{"text":"Great food, shitty service. Get takeout with an app and enjoy your stuff to go. Cookies are maybe best in the city."}
{"text":"I really shouldn't write a reviews just for the deserts, but they're really that good.  Seriously the chocolate chip cookies alone are worth a visit.  If I have a moment of weakness, I know where I'm headed ;)"}
{"text":"Had their lemon ricotta pancakes today they were so delicious i live in the building next door and don't know what took me so long to come here i walked by one day and seen people eating their French toast that looked delicious and i had to come for brunch"}
{"text":"This review applies to the baked items I tried in addition to the cappuccino. A couple of my friends swear by this place and are always recommending to come here for a brunch. So on a nice Sunday the same invite was extended I couldn't resist. Sadly I had breakfast earlier but I will be sure to come back for the main courses as they all looked tempting.  This is a simple, mostly self order kinda place. At the start of the line there are quite a  few baked goods I decided to pick a croissants (a good yardstick to judge a bakery) and a bichon (with a lemon filling) too bad I had already placed my ordered as I noticed some desserts from perennial favorite Rahier! (will come back for those) The croissants and bichon were quite good. Nice and buttery high marks here. The cappuccino didn't fare well though. here is the verdict Espresso: Medium Crema': average Milk: Frothed below Average Latte Art: None A half decent drink. I would say 2.5 stars. Hmm if you are in the mood to grab and go I would say pick up your capp from several decent alternates nearby and pick up your baked good here. I will be back to try the brunch items as they all looked decent."}
{"text":"I try to stay away from sweets for breakfast, but couldn't resist with their chocolate croissant ($2). I think I scarfed it down so quickly because it was that good! The chocolate wasn't too sweet and the croissant was just moist enough. I believe they bake their pastries fresh every morning.   I tried a brie breakfast croissant ($4.50) on another day. It was good, but I didn't find it great. I don't know if grilling it or heating it up is an option, but I'm sure it would have made the sandwich better.  It's a quaint area with dark wooden tables, chalkboard on the walls, and in the mornings the lines can become a little long. It's worth it though."}
{"text":"Chocolate chip cookies (both regular and walnut) is all you need to worry about here.  For those that do want the chocolate chip cookies ... they tend to sell out by 11:30am. The next batch comes in around 1:30-2pm.  Definitely worth getting when they are fresh - absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  I am curious what the calorie count is on one of these."}
{"text":"Has definitely one of the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had! Super gooey, melty chocolate chunks, the cookie it self has a nice bit of crunch to it, but not overly hard. It's a great mixture of crunchy and soft and melty.  My personal favourite tho, is the ricotta pancake. The pancakes are probably some of my favourite since they aren't overly dense, and you don't feel like you're going to die by the end of the meal. These pancakes are soft and light-ish (you'll be definitely full but not on a death bed). The mixture of the syrup with the ricotta and blueberries goes to perfectly together. Just the right amount of sweetness.   The benny's are also quiet amazing and delicious! The hollandaise sauce... just perfect~  Interior - gets super stuffy and hot. So if you decide to eat there, probably best to wear some light clothes or sit by the door... or both. It's almost overwhelmingly hot. But the food is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I have worked in this neighbourhood for 5 years now and very early on, I had the pleasure of experiencing Le Gourmand. It actually surprises me that I haven't written a review yet!  The decor reminds me of a French cafe. The menu is written on a chalk board, the tables are intimate (aka small) round wood tables and at the back of the restaurant is pantry where you can purchase goods such as olive oils, pasta and chocolate.   The reason this review doesn't get more stars is because of their prices. I find them to be astronomical in comparison to what you get. Yesterday I got a large soup, (which isn't all that large) and paid close to $7.00 for it. The average meal is around $12.   If you need an afternoon pick me up though I do suggest going and getting one of their massive cookies. I dare you to try and eat the whole thing. they are pretty big and pretty fantastic. That with a latte, it will fuel you to get thru the rest of the day."}
{"text":"A fantastic place to have brunch, even if you have to hover by tables waiting for a seat! Also great for an espresso-based drink and an avocado & aged cheddar sandwich to go. While we've enjoyed many items on the menu, constant favourites are the nicoise salad, ricotta lemon pancakes and huge chocolate chip walnut cookie: each the best of their kind in the city! Laid out like a bistro with wooden tables and chairs, you order at the bar and wait for your food while soaking in the big space with huge ceilings."}
{"text":"Co worker brought in some chocolate chip cookies today from here. OMG. 4 of us shared one cookie, but we all wished we had our own.  Best."}
{"text":"So it took friends from Vancouver to introduce this place to us.  I lived in this building for five years and never once stepped foot into Le Gourmand.  1. I don't drink coffee.  2. I'm not into sweets.  The cookies are yummy.  Moist, flavourful, chock-full of goodness.  If they're still warm, bonus.    4 stars not five because sometimes the cookies are misshapen and/or partially burnt.  The consistency in size is also a factor.    Damn good cookies though."}
{"text":"cool, better then average coffee shop across the street from my company's Toronto office in the fashion district (I believe it was called).  my visit... roast beef sammich with spicy ass horseradish, awesome espresso"}
{"text":"I simply don't understand why Le Gourmand is as busy as it is. The food is pretty tasty, but they often run out of certain items and the service is awful. It's so chaotic trying to get food or a coffee, no matter what time of day I go there.   To boot, I've ordered a latte from here on three different occasions and they're always terrible. The foam is disappointing and they're incredibly acidic. To boot, the last time I ordered a latte here THREE people who ordered AFTER me got served their espresso-based beverages first (cappuccino, americano, machiato) . I HATE when that happens.   I've finally decided to stop ordering coffee here and stop going for lunch here. It's always a frustrating and disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Great coffee.  Decent pastry.  Place is a little too hip and full of itself for my taste, but the food and coffee are worth stopping in to try.  We just went by chance because it was the closest thing we could see at the time."}
{"text":"5 Stars for their Chocolate and chocolate with walnut cookies. Regular black coffee was great too. Large thick cookies, moist in the middle and crunchy on outside. These cookies are like Pokaroo... i rarely get one because I always JUST miss them.  I've had 2 so far after persistence and determination, and the first one was missing a chunk so I got a free coffee. Goes well with a warm drink!  I see people ordering their chocolate bombs dessert and wow chocolate just flows out .  Cookies were $2.50 but they are big and tasty therefore worth it, although i will go broke eating there everyday.  Service is normal, although first visit i got a free coffee and smile when i got their last cookie, the guy was super nice.  Simply look at their website for photos and you will be sold.    I will be back to test their other products soon."}
{"text":"This place is seriously disorganized. Ordering when more than two people are waiting is chaotic, with an \"order here\" sign at one register and a person at another yelling for people to queue up in no man's land, aka at neither. You request \"for here\" and it comes packaged to go. Your tea comes in a small cup (no pot for you! You're not welcome to stay that long) and when you try to get a bit more hot water they waste a giant takeout cup and fill it just 1/2 full. There's no sandwich soup/salad option so you have to order both or none and the  bread that comes with the soup is so tiny it literally fits in the spoon. Plus the cashiers are all grumpy, which makes me suspect management is problematic. If the tomato bean parmesan soup was tastier there may have been some redemption, but really the only great thing I've had in my various visits here was a cookie, so I think I will take one to go and eat elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"I thought I'd review Le Gourmand so that I'm not just here on Yelp handing out five star reviews.    The cafe is gorgeous and truly feels European. I used to live nearby when it opened, and back then I could still eat gluten, so I would love to enjoy a latte and some phenomenal croissant (the kind you want to instagram) and enjoy feeling a sweet escape.   If you want a latte and pastry, I'd say give it a go.  Those two things are probably great.  Like many European cafés I've been to, you're not there for the service.  It's all behind the counter and waiting around, a little confusing.  Kind of nice if you want to feel like you are travelling and are having trouble speaking the language.  Romantic, non?  Let's be clear: All the stars here (all two) are for the baked goods (which I did not eat) and the atmosphere.  If those two were any less sensually appealing, my last visit would be one or zero stars.  I popped in there recently for the first time in years, remembering that they also had a chalk board menu beyond the baked goods.  I was nearby and wanted breakfast, not much else was open at that early hour.  I waited in line, and the girl with tongs smiled at me and asked if she could help me, so I ordered the eggs with bacon.  She just smiled and said okay, then changed her gaze.  Clearly she was just there to pluck pastries with tongs.  She didn't say that to me, it was sort of implied.  She wasn't rude, just maybe a little nervous.  When I got to the woman at cash, I ordered again.  Eggs and bacon.  Over medium.  No toast please.  And a coffee.  She said okay, and I paid.  No smile from her.    Then I'm waiting around by the counter, enjoying the display of beautiful chocolate bars and spices.  I wait a while.  Then the woman at the cash sees me and says, \"did you get your coffee?\"    It's been sitting on the counter, behind a crowd of people.  I admit, I get unreasonably cranky about how coffee is done when I'm out for breakfast.  So consider my mood a little.  I have a coffee there, cooling on the counter, but no meal.  And this isn't the kind of place where the mugs are the size of pho bowls and someone comes around refilling it every time you take a sip.  That was it.  One little teacup of not-hot-anymore coffee.  Like I said, I get cranky.  Another person, maybe you, might just smile and request a warm cup.  I'm not proud to say that I most often will take the cold cup and scurry away to my journal.  I'm an introvert.  And I was hungry.  Then I get my meal handed over on a big plate by another non-smiling woman behind the counter.  I take it and sit down.  I think the staff is probably doing the best with what they are given.  There didn't seem to be much of a system.  Not everyone has to be smiling all the time.  The girl with the tongs smiled, but all in all there was little to no communication.  I'm not here to rag on the staff.    Let's talk about this breakfast.  First thing I notice is there's toast.  I asked for no toast.  I know this might not sound like a terrible thing, but it is if you miss eating bread and don't really want to stare at it while eating the rest of the meal.  It's also making me feel bad, because it's obviously going to go to waste whether I throw it out or \"return\" it.   The eggs were o-kay. Actually over medium, which doesn't happen often.  Very flat, white, like they belonged in a sandwich.  The bacon.  Two strips that kinda fused together at one end, so it was like a little bacon \"V\".  Each strip about the width of old juicy fruit gum, you know the thin floppy sticks of gum wrapped in silver?  Actually I think the bacon was smaller.  It was crispy though, and I like that.  Except, and I'm not sure how this is even possible, but it was cold.  Crispy, but cold.  Maybe not ice cold, but way colder than room temperature.  It was a bit of a shock.  Just for kicks, I poked the toast to see.  Yup.  Also cold.  And there was a pile of greens, the mixed kind with bits of purple in it, tossed in a vinaigrette.  A little limp but not unbearable.  This whole time my coffee wasn't getting any hotter.  So if you are looking for breakfast, I would go elsewhere.  If you want to feel like you are in Europe for a few minutes, stop in and try the pastries, they looked amazing.  The tiled floors were almost enough to soothe me...but I'm a sucker for beauty."}
{"text":"It's true that the this place has probably the best croissants in the city. They are honestly perfect and you can often smell them from outside. It's no wonder they sell out quickly, but thats something to be aware of. However, their coffee is just awful and I've never been satisfied ordering anything else off the menu - though I've only sampled 5-6 things. The seating is tight and they're always busy. They'd do well to order some umbrellas for the patio in the summer as the direct sunlight can really beat down on you."}
{"text":"I love their cookies. I've tried the chocolate chip walnut and also the peanut butter one. They are absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots for brunch. I used to frequent this spot a lot (I lived in the building), and every visit reinforced my love for a well run kitchen.  Eggs Benedict, sandwiches, pastries and coffee were always superb and never miss a beat. Sometimes the crowds in that area can be a bit much, but the crew behind the counter always delivered.  If you're looking for a place to catch a quick bite or slow down with a coffee and people watch, this is a hip place to kick back. Great place to start your weekend activities in one of the trendiest neighbourhoods in the world (queen west)."}
{"text":"I had a choc chip with walnut cookie today and it was AMAZING!  It was huge, which i'm always suspicious of (usually, only nasty cookies are that huge) but it was soft and moist on the inside and crumbly and hard on the outside. there were ample choc chip chunks and walnuts. MmMMm  Oddly, i got the cookie from our company flu shot clinic.  Take a shot, get a cookie.  The cookie was so good, i wanted to take another flu shot to get another cookie.   I'll definitely venture to the cafe to check out their other goodies. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"The stars are for the memories....  Can't believe this place is closed....so sad."}
{"text":"Best chocolate cookies in the whole wide world! Always wanted to try other things here but the cookies always gets me. It's been in the city for a long time and you know why it's been successful all these years!"}
{"text":"So I ventured out to the west end and stopped by my old favourite for an americano. What a disappointment. After dealing with an unusually condescending cashier, I sat down, slightly less enthusiastic than when I stepped in. Whatever, I thought. My americano would surely make up for the less than pleasant interaction. Was I ever wrong. UGHHH. It was bitter as hell. I actually couldn't have more than two sips before throwing it out. What happened Le Gourmand? You were my good old faithful cafe.  Oh, and no more fresh OJ. Bummer. Guess I'll have to keep hunting..."}
{"text":"Great baked goods, really solid food and coffee, reasonably friendly staff for a busy place."}
{"text":"During afternoon slumps at the office, it would be closer for me to go to another cafe in the area but I walk the distance to come here. The pastries are wayyyyyyyyyy better than the other cafes in the area, they have better coffee and it's more reasonably priced. I have literally tried and liked every pastry they have. Only complaint is they don't have any scones.  The lines go quick, there is a nice small area in the front to sit, and you can even get a sandwich there. Great little spot."}
{"text":"Yup, I am on the chocolate chip walnut bandwagon for LIFE. It doesn't get any better, my friends, just go eat one and thank me later.  The rest of the pastries are also good enough to take multiple bullets for.   YUM."}
{"text":"Cozy restaurant packed with atmosphere! We had a window seat for two upstairs. Very romantic. Food was delicately seasoned so natural flavors came out. The Caesar salad had just a few small pieces of bacon and the poutine had a little bacon as well. Nice touch. The asparagus was shaved at the bottom and lightly buttered. The rib eye was outstanding grilled to perfection!  Dessert was a chocolate mousse cake - sinful! Portions were perfectly sized which I always appreciate. The staff were all polite, professional and attentive. Seriously with the trip!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to get the walnut chocolate chip cookies here but they were sold out on this Saturday afternoon. Le Gourmand was packed and nearly all the tables were occupied. I got the brownie which came out to $5. The brownie definitely did not taste that great and was not worth the $5. Next time, I hope to get my hands on their chocolate chip cookies as I've read that those ones are the star! Service was average."}
{"text":"Decent lunch, had roast beef sandwich that they used a grill press on. Portugese tart was good, a little sweet and custard was a not fully smooth, it was nice and flaky though. Ordering process requires you to pay upfront and the layout doesn't make much sense to me unless you're a regular."}
{"text":"Cane back to try another sandwich. I absolutely loves the pancetta with arugula. I have a favorite now and I'm officially a regular.   Service is great - I think the girl who served me at cash today was new. She forgot my cookie and gave me the wrong one. She also didn't punched in my order right so I had to wait a few minutes for my sandwich.   They gave me a walnut chocolate cookie on the house for waiting.   No I'm not giving 5 stars for the free cookie although it affects my overall rating since they care about the customer. The sandwiches are great as well as the chocolate cookie and walnut chocolate cookie. Excellent quality!"}
{"text":"Great ambience! The chocolate banana bread pudding was simply delightful:) - they serve you a huge serving for only $3.25. The cappuchino was also good quality."}
{"text":"Get the brie and prosciutto sandwich heated in the panini press -- it's to die for.  I love the sandwiches here. It gets a little slammed at lunch but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Staff is seriously incompetent. They mess up almost every order I've made from them. They leave pastries out meaning more than one time I've found dead bugs in the food. Sometimes they don't even fill their cups up half way, so if you order a medium you really only get a small. I've tried giving them the benefit of the doubt, but at this point they have proven they truly don't care about the customer."}
{"text":"Had walnut chocolate chip cookie. One of Best for cookies in town! Im sure all other  sweets are delicious as well."}
{"text":"The chocolate chip and chocolate chip cookie with walnuts are life changing! And no matter what time of day you go the chocolate chips in the cookies are always melted and gooey. They are also huge so you always leave your sweet tooth satisfied. 100% the best chocolate chip cookies in toronto!!"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast without a wait.  There's a pretty large selection of to-go items as well as omelettes and other things you can order in. Although the Le Gourmand is typically a little busy, it always seems to have a seat or two open - so never worry about the stress of waiting too long for a spot."}
{"text":"This place honestly has the best chocolate chip cookies in the city - crispy exterior with a chewy, moist interior. Plus it's packed with lots chocolate chips! I've had their chocolate chip walnut one too but still 100% prefer the classic chocolate chip."}
{"text":"Great coffee, good food, slightly expensive."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday. Definitely recommend showing up earlier if you're with a group to grab a table. The brunch can also take a few minutes to be finished as well, so arrive ready to wait (but I promise it's worth it!)   The whole place is close to a cafeteria style where you order at the counter and go get your food when it's ready to take to your table.   They had an amazing array of baked goods and tons of fresh squeezed orange juice. (I didn't grab any but I'm going back because the cookies looked mouth watering.)  Their brunch menu had things like lemon ricotta pancakes and Norwegian eggs benny on it (I will come back to try the pancakes for sure.)   I had the breakfast burrito, which was vegetarian to my surprise! It had scrambled eggs, refried beans, guacamole and sour cream. It was super delicious and I would go back to eat 20 if I could.   My friends each got dishes involving eggs and all loved them too.   Great brunch spot all-in-all"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great coffee, sandwiches, meals, baked goods, and atmosphere. I usually go for the avocado, tomato, and cheese sandwich. Never disappoints! Also a must is their hot out of the oven chocolate chip cookies! Heavenly :D"}
{"text":"Had a very good meal here with the family. I like the cozy atmosphere, very warm. Classic, old style French cuisine. I would say direct competitor to la maison verte. I personally like here more. Food was very good."}
{"text":"Can I just say the chocolate bomb...looks the bomb! My diet will not permit it but I WANT it!!  Absolutely delicious latte.   The place has several tables. It is warm but I did not did the place overly welcoming. That said the beautiful smell if freshly brewed coffee that greats you upon opening the door was most inviting!  Definitely somewhere I would go again. If my eyes did not deceive me they had gluten free treats! Great selection of snacks too."}
{"text":"Much better and less expensive coffee than Starbucks. The baked goods are excellent quality. Quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming my go-to-cookie-craving destination! I'm sure you've read most of the other reviews about how their chocolate chip cookies are like four cookies in one, delicious, divine, etc. I would add that their cookies are dangerously addictive. I mean can someone go there once a week, every week without health consequences?!   You would think that their sub-par customer service would deter me, but that's not the case. I like my cookie even if it's delivered without a smile. Hell I'd like my cookie if it fell on the floor and was then delivered to me (well, in that case, I may ask for a replacement). Be sure to get there early in the afternoon to get your cookie because they do run out. Can't they save me one? I am probably one of their most loyal clients!"}
{"text":"Ohhhh the giant cookies, soooo good.   When the place is not packed be sure to try a sandwich, they are good.   But most times we get the cookies to go, Cannot recommend them enough."}
{"text":"Delicious Chocolate Bomb. I am Swiss, I know my chocolate ;-) The coffee is good too. Definitely a place I would go back."}
{"text":"Come here for the chocolate chip cookies! Best cookie of the year 2017 award well deserved - chewey, thick, and just right amount of sweetness."}
{"text":"Nice place to get a drink and work on my laptop. Discovered this place meeting up with people for business. Good music and relaxed environment. Staff are friendly. Food is bit pricey but good quality. Would recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"\"La Gourmand had a bit of a communal feel to it with its main traffic area covered in tiles and warm coloured wood in the middle of the large hall.\"  \"This time we got their Almond Financier and a much praised Chocolate Chunk Cookie. The almond treat was like a baked vanilla custard with a delightful chewy crust. Not too sweat, slightly grainy and very pleasant to palate. As far as the cookie went, it did feel home made - bready, uniquely shaped with a hint of burnt grease.\"  Just a few bites of our full review."}
{"text":"Oh My God. The chocolate chip cookies at Le Gourmand are to die for. Don't order anything else (well, maybe some milk) cause these things are a meal in themselves. They are soft in the middle but crunchy on the outside and if you ever manage to get one straight out of the oven, it's like you've gone straight to heaven.  The other food is also great. They have delicious quiches with TONS of ingredients; goat cheese, red peppers, onion, mushrooms, sundried tomatoes. With a side salad it's only about $8. Their sandwiches are also sooo yummy, but if you're in a hurry, don't get them grilled. The roast beef is amazing and the proscuitto and brie will clog your arteries but fill your mouth with tastiness. They also have some more hearty meals like meatloaf and potatoes and salad or mac and cheese. However, I would avoid the Mac and Cheese, because although it's good, it'll cost you and they don't give you very much.   The establishment itself is very nice. High ceilings, lots of light and lots of seating. They also have frozen pastas and sauces for sale, as well as some random produce and some canned beans and olives. The prices are so-so but the food is delicious. And remember, don't leave without a chocolate chip cookie!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this quaint resto. For some reason I didn't want to sit out in the terrace. I found it to be romantic inside with the stone walls surrounding you. The staff service was excellent always making sure we had everything! We went for lunch so it was quiet inside which I just loved. We had the beef steak which was to perfection with sweet potatoes fries with truffles and shaved Parmesan.  Delish! I really like romantic little  spots and this is one of them... A Gem!"}
{"text":"A great spot for a morning snack! We normally order: the smoked salmon and cream cheese on a toasted bagel, an almond croissant, a chocolate chip cookie, a coffee, and a tea.  Our total is normally around $17.00, approximately.  This spot is charming, the cookies are delicious, the pastries are fresh and flaky, and they serve good coffee! It's a great cafe to visit for beginning your morning - sipping your coffee and reading the newspaper, or chatting with friends and family. It's an environment that's open to all types of parties, with consistently delicious pastries. Service isn't the friendliest, but the food and atmosphere make up for it.   Overall, one of our favourites!"}
{"text":"Ditto to all 5 star reviews regarding their cookies.  ...I wish I could just leave it at that lol but that's not how elites do it!  I don't even know where to start or which words to use to best describe how AMAZING these cookies are.  Specifically the chocolate chip and chocolate chip walnut cookie.  They have rightfully earned top spot for the #1 cookies in Toronto.  I've had the cookies a couple times before because friends have picked some up for me, but I recently had the pleasure of getting some for myself.  The people working there are super friendly and happy.  Just makes me smile when people are genuinely nice.    Okay onto the cookies.  Perfection. The right about of softness.  The right amount of crispy.  Perfect dough.  Everything.  They even stay soft and gooey 2 days later!  I had bought 2 on a Friday and ate the second one on Sunday.  Popped it into the microwave for 12 seconds and it tasted as if it were fresh out the oven.  Oh and yes,  YOU MUST have it warmed up.  Like, must. The edges have a nice little crunch, nothing too crazy.  It balances with the super soft center.  Be careful though!  You might lose some cookie, with how soft that center is!  I do prefer the chocolate chip walnut over the plain chocolate chip.  This is very odd because I almost never like nuts in any of my food.  I just feel like the walnuts add another dimension to the cookie, making it even more out of this world."}
{"text":"I went for brunch the last two weeks in a row. So yummy!  I love the goat cheese mushroom omelet. It's flavourful and not overcooked like so many other omelets in the city. The yogurt parfait is also delicious.   But, the absolute best dish is the huervos chilques! It is so good I can't even describe it. Just go try it!   And those cookies..."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch after New Years.  On such a freezing day, I have to say that it would have been nice if they thought more about cold-proofing the place.  We were seated in the back, where people can walk in and out and it was chilly like woah.  I got the Smoked Salmon Benedict (or Eggs Norwegian) and it was delicious.  The hollandaise had a little more zing than what you'd expect but complimented the smoked salmon so well.  And instead of sitting atop a store-bought english muffin, the base was some fresh and tasty ciabatta.  With that said, there were not a ton of vegetarian/pescetarian options.  J got the prosciutto sandwich (grilled) and our friends got the roast beef sandwich.  Everyone was happy with their food.  The greens that accompany some dishes have a tasty vinaigrette and were very fresh.  Staff was attentive and discreet.  Prices were a bit high but okay.  And they have Limonata and Aranciata, so you can't complain about that.  The interior is cute - tile walls, some banquet benches and some hard-backed chairs.  Modern with a homey edge, I'd say."}
{"text":"Second visits already.  First time just got a chocolate chip cookie and a mocha to go, and it was an amazing experience last weekend. So I can't stop thinking about the cookies afterwards and decided to come back to visit again by this morning.  This time I got two types of salad and their daily salad was just as awesome as other stuffthe apple pie looks soooo yummy but I can't eat more anymore lol   will come back for that next time then!)  And got two types of cookies as well. Of course still included chocolate chips! and got a cappuccino this time! I like it!  And I was kinda disappointed about they don't serve french toast nor pancake during weekdays  Too bad! But I'll be more aware of that next time and come back here for that on WEEKENDS!!! XDD Love this place so far!! Oh but I can't find the plug in place for my computer or phone though. Not a super good place for study though!(and the music is a bit loud as well!!"}
{"text":"Cool coffee shop and bakery. They offer sandwiches and baked goods, as well as coffee and tea of course.   Had chamomile tea and the pear tart. The tart was not only beautiful but delicious. But wait, there is more. I also indulged in some carrot chocolate bread pudding. It was tasty, fresh, and moist to perfection. Such a large slice that I couldn't even finish it."}
{"text":"I came around 11am and they were out of chocolate croissants! I ended up getting a round almond tart with jam inside ($4). I was surprised how crunchy it was, almost like a sugar cookie. It's a little pricey but I understand that there are layers and work involved.  I came another day at 9:30am and got a cream tart and chocolate souffle for $6.25.  the cream tart has a very crunchy pastry. It is sweet and flaky like greek desserts.  the souffle was a disappointment. it was extremely sweet! Felt like I was eating a soft sugar ball and I just couldn't finish it. Each bite has an extra burst of sugar and it was too much of a sugar hit. The texture is creamy, soft, and way sweeter than timbits for sure.   I noticed that all their pastries are very crunchy, giving me the impression that they use a lot of white sugar, and I don't even know if they use real butter. This place is  only good for when you need a sugar fix."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop in Toronto.  Yes, as everyone raves, the cookies are delicious - chocolate chip walnut is my favorite.  I also recommend the Nutella hot chocolate.  I'd like to try some other items as everything I've had has been consistently good.  Unlike some other Yelpers, I've consistently received good service and good vibes from everyone that works there.  They just need free wifi to push it over the top."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've been to in a very long time.  I cannot give anything less than 5 stars.  The service and food were amazing.  We shared the 26 oz rib eye which was cooked to perfection.  We also got some smoked salmon,  king crab legs and ecargots which were also delicious.  The waitresses were always smiling and super friendly.  It's worth the price coming here and i can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Perfect spot. We came and stayed three days in the nice clean city of Toronto. This was our perfect relaxation coffee shop each day. Coffee is delicious! And cheap. The croissants and chocolate and cookies are awesome. The people are super nice. The eggs Benny looked amazing and the salads, quiches looked delish. I would come here every week if we lived in TO. Nice music, too.  Loved."}
{"text":"The absolute worst place. Consistently bad food and even worse service. Today I purchased the \"watermelon lemonade\" which was 6oz for 4$ and was spoiled. It had a sour rotten taste. I'm done with this place. 8/10 times I've gone in, it's been bad service or overpriced crappy food. Not going back here ever."}
{"text":"It's my first time at Le gourmand & I must say the latte is one of the best that I have tried in Toronto. To add to the joy, the latte art also was almost perfect! I also tried the almond croissant which was very close to what I have tried in Paris and much like Paris they don't warm up their croissants on such requests ;) I would say that it's a warm place for a chat with friends or to grab some croissants/ coffee/ sandwiches etc. and go. Definitely worth a one time try!"}
{"text":"Best chocolate chip cookie 2017 was clearly a well deserved award! It's the best I've found in the city so far and worth a street car in the rain. I also had the white hot chocolate - also delicious but not a lotta liquid for a $6 drink"}
{"text":"You know that it's an old building when the top of the door frame hits you at about the eyebrows. I'm tall, but not THAT tall. It turned out the building was indeed old - built in 1847 from local stone; it served as residences for multiple families over the years; even a blacksmith shop. A hundred years later it finally became a restaurant in the picturesque lakeside town of Pointe-Claire.  We were here for our final work dinner after a somewhat-grueling business trip; and the smaller group and surroundings made this a more cozy, intimate affair than previous dinners. We were led to our own space in the upstairs area, near a crackling fireplace, where we proceeded to order cocktails. (They had a local stout on the menu, so I had to get that first).  The menu was small but excellent (the best kind). i was momentarily torn, but in about 30 seconds the decision was easy: they had venison; which is always a no-brainer for me.  -- Red Deer in mushroom sauce: Fantastic; and probably the best venison dish I've ever had.  It was not only tender; but lean and flavorful. Not gamey (even though I'm usually OK with a little). It was served over delicious potatoes with a side of perfect green beans. I actually felt sorry for some of my compatriots, who ordered something else. They liked their dishes, but were not as thrilled as I.  Then came dessert. i had actually eaten so well during the week (with little exercise) that I declined, despite the great choices (creme brûlée, apple tart, profiterole, chocolate torte, etc). I ordered a nice glass or port and a coffee instead and enjoyed the oohs, aahs and spirited conversation with my co-workers.  Though I usually don't award five stars for a single visit, I had such a fantastic meal and stellar time that I feel silly bestowing less.  If I could come back to one place on my next visit here, this would be it!"}
{"text":"I came to try their legendary cookies and I was not disappointed. Their chocolate chip walnut cookies were chunky and was the perfect texture - crunch on the outside but soft and breakable on the inside! Their curried apple and chicken salad wasn't too bad either!  I would have given Le Gourmand a 5 star if it weren't for the service I've received from the cashier. She got in my face and went, \"I UNDERSTAND!\" after I repeated my order to her. She continued to be rude towards me as she was cashing me out. Unfortunately, the service that I've received from the cashier dampened my overall experience at Le Gourmand. Hopefully service will improve when (and if) I decide to drop by for another visit."}
{"text":"Gooey chocolate cookies, croissants and breakfast menus that satisfied my hunger and my soul. What a way to start my weekend.. Try this place!"}
{"text":"Working in the area I am a frequent customer here. It's embarrassing, but I'm eating out 3 times a day and 9 out of 10 breakfasts are from this place. Good croissants and other pastries, good fair trade and organic coffee - what's not to love? My favourite lunch meal is their quiche and salad combo. I also hear that their sandwiches are really good, and they carry Orangina, Limonata and Chinotto. (Where's the good old days when these came in a can and what's up with the tiny bottles at the same price as cans used to be? But I digress...) Ditto for the cookies - flourless chocolate (known as Nookie Cookie) and walnut-chocolate chip are both delicious in their own different ways. All-in-all a good place and a default lunch choice for many at my office."}
{"text":"The best chocolate chip cookie in the city. And some of the best drip coffee. To make the cities best anything warrants 5 stars. It's an institution."}
{"text":"Wish I could say my food made up for the terrible service and cleanliness, but it was mediocre at best. For a place called Le Gourmand, I could laugh at how plain and pricey my salad was. It was far from busy when I visited, and of the four people working behind the counter, none seemed remotely interested in telling me any of the ingredients in their salads when I asked. People have varying allergies and intolerances; either make signs or educate your staff. Terribly messy washrooms, disinterested service, medium salad all at a high price. What a disappointment after some high recommendations."}
{"text":"Can only speak for the cookies but the chocolate chip cookies here are the best I've EVER HAD!! I think they got an award for it too in 2017. Crispy on the outside and oh sooooo gooey inside. My only regret is only getting 1. I also had the oatmeal raisin one and it was also good, but I definitely recommend the chocolate chip one. You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"We were in the area and decided to drop in for a sweet treat.  We had the chocolate chip walnut cookie, chocolate soufflé cake, chocolate bomb cake, lemon and apple danish. Ok so it was a few thousand calories but everything was delicious. Fillings were surprisingly not overly sweet, pastry was light and/or flakey.  Everything was nicely baked.   Friendly service, clean establishment.  Well worth a visit when in the area."}
{"text":"Tried a few different sweets and cookies here. Found everything to be only O.K accept their chocolate chip cookies which were amazing. If I were to recommend anything or go back it would be those chocolate chip cookies, Best I've ever tried. Just don't forget to bring milk"}
{"text":"I work across the street from this absolute wet dream of a place so frequent it fairly often for lunches. Personal favourite is the Waldorf wrap (not heated), HOWEVER they have the best peanut butter cookies on the planet. You can get them hot off the presses from early afternoon. Delish.  Lovely staff too.   They have a good range of sandwiches and it's a good option for salads as well. Especially if you're looking for something fast.   NOTE: Whenfind yourself awake at 3am wishing you were eating 3 of them in a cookie sandwich (and this will happen) then it's about time you stopped buying the cookies. Yes, stop buying them and start buying the COOKIE DOUGH!!!! They sell it as well and you can make them yourself. I've tried this and they taste just as good."}
{"text":"Okay, can I just say nutella hot chocolate? Dangerous, yes, but worth it! Food is very yummy and I agree with other reviews that they quite possibly make the best cookies ever!!! Staff seems really stressed and over-worked (understandable since it's always packed), and sometimes my orders have been lost in the busy-ness. Maybe the owner needs to hire more people? Otherwise a great little spot :)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the BEST chocolate chip cookie in the city of Toronto, it's at Le Gourmand.  Oh, and the service could be friendlier. I come back for the cookies and buy the coffee to pair with my cookie. It's really all about the cookie."}
{"text":"Friendly counter service. Happy to find they had a washroom (hand dryer broken). The Americano was excellent, as good as I recall having. Most importantly; that cookie; chocolate, almond something..  It's fresh, chocolate melting, AMAZING.   I ate it so fast I'm little ashamed, glutton. I'd eat that too much if I lived closer."}
{"text":"Le Gourmand just opened this new location at Yonge and Eg and it is definitely a great third addition to their popular food tracks they have already left in the downtown core of Toronto.  I love this place for two specific reasons so far - brunch and purchasing high quality cuisine that is freshly baked or prepared in their bakery/eatery take-out counter.  I was at Le Gourmand yesterday for brunch for Mother's Day with my family and it was absolutely delicious!   My mom and I both ordered the oatmeal buttermilk pancakes and they were to die for!  The pancakes itself were made with oatmeal and buttery taste baked into the actual cake. The pancakes were garnished with pure maple syrup and strawberry sauce.   To accompany the pancakes, the plate was loaded up with fresh seasonal fruit and two slices of crispy bacon.  My sister ordered the fruit salad bowl with yogurt, granola and honey. Fruits such as grapes, apples, pinapples, all three types of melon, and pears were chopped up and mixed up with granola, yogurt and honey!   For a very simple dish, it was so delicious and plentiful. Although this may not seem to be enough to fill up one's tummy, it definitely left my sister very satisfied.  Along with our food, we had coffee, which was freshly and perfectly brewed with cold cream and fresh brown sugar to sweet up our drink.   My sister had a glass of orange juice, which was HUGE and was fresh and packed with pulp.  Aside from eating in their seating area, this location of Le Gourmand has their well known take-out counter, which has a huge variety of sandwiches, salads, bake goods and hot drinks you can take out and enjoy in the comfort of your own home.  This place just spells out delicious!"}
{"text":"update: Just tried their regular cookies.  All nothing special.  Way too much chocolate.  Way too thick.  Some like it thick.  I'm more of a thin and long guy.  Its about quality not quantity. I call this the obese hipster cookie. Kuddos to the owners for making it hipster.  Your doing a good job serving your clientele.  This place would not stand a chance anywhere else except where it is. The peanut butter cookie is good.  Thick yet crispy and not overwhelming. Not my thing."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday afternoon for a casual business meeting. There was a wide variety of age groups there and people doing different things - other meetings, people studying, reading books, etc.   I had a tea, which was less expensive than a  typical Starbucks or Second Cup tea, but they didn't have a wide variety of tea choices. I didn't get anything to eat so I can't comment on the food, although I did notice a bunch of baked goods and some treats from the well-known bakery on Bayview, Rahier. They also carried a range of soups and sandwiches if you want to grab something for lunch.   It has the air of trying to be a cafe in France, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. The bathrooms are a bit on the grungy side though (slightly more commiserate with what you might find in France!). I don't know if I would go out of my way to go back there, but it would be a welcome change from the typical big chain coffee shops if I was in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I get angry because whenever I come here there are NO DAMN COOKIES! Every single flippin time and the ONE time I do get a cookie, it's overcooked and slightly burnt. All I hear are praises for this place about their delicious cookies and I feel jipped.   Although I've always lost the cookie battle with Le Gourmand, I do love their sandwiches and quiche. The sandwiches are made on lovely crisp baguettes and with the freshest ingredients. The quiche is light, fluffy but flavorful.   There isn't much service here as you walk up to the counter, order, and seat yourself but the staff is friendly and are happy to heat your sandwich or grab you a fresh baguette.   Overall, this is a great place for lunch or maybe even breakfast. The prices aren't as high as I expected for their delicious sandwiches as I had expected and definitely worth the price considering they are made with good quality ingredients. They also have ground coffee and cocoa mix for sale."}
{"text":"My review is only going to discuss ONE THING, the most important thing in the whole place and maybe the whole city: the chocolate chip cookie.  This is, hands down the best, the ultimate, the most amazing chocolate chip cookie in Toronto. It's oooey, gooey, often still warm, often slightly undercooked on the inside, oozing with chocolate chip cookies. It's buttery, and it's perfect. I will always get a cookie when I am anywhere close to here. I just have to."}
{"text":"Where should I begin with how unimpressed I am with this place? I've been twice now - the first time, lackluster service and an overpriced, overbaked cookie. The second time, horrible service where I stood at the counter for five minutes before anyone paid attention to me, then got kicked out literally 5 minutes later as they closed. Was this not something you can inform people of before they order your unimpressive, overpriced food?   Ps, don't order the tiny $4 lava cake - what a waste. And don't waste ANY money on the service - this place is staffed by people who look like they can't wait to get out of there and would rather do anything but speak to or look at you.   I'm obviously still angry about this!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for a latte or quick bite to eat. It is in a very convenient location for me, service is great, and the food is phenomenal.  Everything I've ever ordered here has been absolutely amazing!!   If you're a fan of sweet treats I highly recommend their soufflé and my latte of choice - chai vanilla latte."}
{"text":"For 3 week nights I was taking classes at Toronto Image Works, which is down the road from Le Gourmand. I'd come in before hand to grab a coffee and a quick bite to eat. Le Gourmand has excellent coffee -- which one would expect, it being a fancy-ass coffee shop. Their selection of soups, sandwiches, cookies, and pastries is what really makes them standout. (I usually get a soup when i'm there, and haven't really been disappointed with any of their choices.) My wife loves their cookies -- a lot."}
{"text":"I've had this horrible habit - coffee - morning coffee.  Even if I don't need it.  There is something about going to a cafe or coffee shop in the morning and standing in line with the other addict-eds ( because i am sure I am not alone).  My routine in the morning is the same. Get up, shower, make some toast and coffee. Catch transit, find coffee then off to work.  Le Gourmand is that stop along my route.  I had always wondered about this Lil place en route.  I thought at first it was a french restaurant or a gourmet grocery store. All great things but not a place to stop on my way to work but then one day I did. It was because I saw the cookies in the window.  For the amount you pay for a cookie, it was either two fifty or something close to three bucks. For that change, it better be some darn fine eatin`!  I hate to say it -nope.    That aside.  The coffee ain't bad.  It's next door to Starbucks.  If those customers knew what they could get by walking a store over my bet is you would make the journey.  It's a casual cafe setting. Yet at the same time it sells everything from cookbooks to pasta to chocolate in one half.  In the next half you buy your coffee, pastry, sandwiches or salad at a really awesome price (except that freakin cookie!) .  Let me give you an example - a small coffee including tax is 1.26.   If you go over to Starbucks you will be paying 50 cents more. Why?  Now don`t be put off by the customer service. It`s a bit hit and miss.  I have yet to come across someone who actually seemed happy to see a customer.  It`s not as if  they are mean just there to get you what you need aka caffeine.  So give this little place a try, why don't ya?"}
{"text":"I would advise coming here on the weekend, they have delicious eats and I love the small cafe atmosphere. I have been here several times, and my photos reflect that. I would suggest coming in earlier as it get's really busy on weekends and they sometimes run out of items.   I'm not a big fan of their drip coffee, so I usually grab a coffee from Starbucks next door. I love the Crème Brule French Toast, I'm usually not a big fan of French Toast but they really know what they're doing. Thick Slices of Toast that is usually super moist, topped with Creme Chantilly and in season fruit. Another thing to order is the  Huevos Chiilaquiles, it's really good. Tomato, tortilla, eggs, avocado, pico de gallo, cilantro and delicious thick slices of Bacon.   I have also had the Lemon Ricotta Buttermilk Pancakes which are not bad, I like how moist they are and topped with Lemon cream cheese mousse, Blueberry sauce, & maple syrup. Most of the pastries are really good, the chocolate chip cookie is famous here but it's a little too overwhelming for me. If you have a sweet tooth, you'll enjoy it.   Keep Eating,   Angela"}
{"text":"Wow I think I've discovered a real diamond here ! Lovely homely decor. Friendly but professional service and stunning food ! Prices match the quality !! I will be returning that's for sure !"}
{"text":"I have passed by this place so many times that I may have built some hype in my mind, which may have ruined it for me.   First impression: LOVE the open space. LOVE the decor and LOVE the chalkboard menu. It's awesome. I even enjoyed waiting in line because, it was totally going to be worth it - so far everything was fabulous and so the food must be also.  Got a bit of Spanish & salmon salad and butter chicken - the salad seemed to have all the things I love; salmon, nuts, spinach in light dressing - and well, can't go wrong with butter chicken really, can you?  Apparently, you can. I think this is where I need to say that I am a food lover- the sight of it makes my mouth water 95% of the time and you've really got to have not tried for that to not happen. This was one of those times.  The chicken - was not quite buttery and had more curry flavour than anything else. I only had a few pieces of chicken and it really was a soupy kind, not the stew kind.  it came with what I heard was Basmati rice - that was just dry - I believe Uncle Ben's basmati rice was better than this.  Apparently I don't like spinach and smoked salmon together either - even though I love both dearly. My friend's meatloaf was absolutely wonderful -but the mash potato and house salad was not. Overall, the bland food left lot to be desired - apparently they're not a big believer of seasoning. I have no idea what inspired me to pay $20 for blandness...but there you have it.  It's a chic little spot and I imagine fabulous place for coffee/tea with cookies or something - but if you're looking for a place to have a nice  sit down meal during lunch or dinner or whatever - there are much better options just steps away."}
{"text":"One if the best restaurants in the west island for good and ambiance. Excellent romantic date place or lunch with friends"}
{"text":"JESUS CHRIST, THAT CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE. Heaven IS a place on Earth. Go for it. Vegan? Well get ready to disappoint cause you're going to fail in the presence of the perfect balance of buttery, chocolatey, chewy, crunchy pleasure. Basically, the heroine of the chocolate chip cookie kingdom without grave consequence minus larger pants. There's a Gap around the corner, don't worry about it.  Nothing lives in it's shadow. I mean, the Nicoise salad is pretty good."}
{"text":"Before arriving to Toronto, I just wanted a place with really good breakfast oatmeal and it sure was my best one here. My friend recommended the croissant breakfast which I happily accepted and it was mind blowing. The texture of the croissant stands out the most for me. Will be back the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"A gourmand = someone who's \"a glutton for food and drink\", so basically every foodie. If I could choose my last meal on earth, it'd be here. (Doesn't warrant an explanation if you've had a taste of Le Gourmand, but if you haven't, the baked goods are out of this world.)  I sampled a little bit everything with my coworkers recently on the Ritual app (I think the menu items may be different than the one on the website?)  We had the cobb salad (the star of the show was the honey mustard dressing), smoked salmon sandwich, the BEST almond croissant I've ever had (flaky, airy perfection) and their Toronto-famous chocolate chip cookie (with walnuts because they ran out of the regular ones). I loved every bite.  If you're eating in, the place seats about 20-25. Hooray because I found my new favourite cafe!"}
{"text":"Le Gourmand is a nice spot for a fresh pastry and cup of coffee. They have a selection of 12 of so pastries, as well as a full compliment of coffee options.  At times the line up gets rather long, yet this tends to move quickly. There is an adequate amount of seating, so not a bad spot for a work meeting or coffee with friends."}
{"text":"Okay - so I went back.  I had a chocolate chip cookie and holy CRAP was it ever tasty and amazing. Equal parts gooey and crispy and delicious. Heavenly overload.  However, because of my previous experiences and still ho-hum customer service on the return, I'm only upgrading to a 3.   Cookie = 6 out of 5.  Service = 1.5 out of 5."}
{"text":"These cookies did not disappoint! My boyfriend and I visited Le Gourmand Tuesday afternoon. The service was quick but then again we only ordered two cookies and the nutella hot chocolate.   At $4.75, the small nutella hot chocolate (with no whipped cream!) wasn't worth it. It was far too small for that price. Taste wise, it was sort of mediocre. Nothing special about it.   However, the cookies made up for the subpar hot chocolate! We ordered the chocolate chip and chocolate walnut cookies. It was delicious. The middle was soft and the chocolate was melty! The outer edge was crunchy. Best of both words and again, very delicious. They were big (in terms of diameter) and really thick (maybe 1\"). The only downside is that they're probably upwards of 400 calories and they disappeared so quickly!   I would give my visit 4.5 stars. The missing 0.5 star is because the hot chocolate was small for the price and rather subpar taste-wise."}
{"text":"I've eaten so much beet salad from this place I'm surprised I haven't turned red. In the summer, I worked nearby and this was one of my regular stops for a quick lunch (or dinner) on my way to the subway.    It's food is high quality but be prepared to pay for it. They don't call it \"LE GOURMAND\" for nothing.   BUT! If you have to buy anything from here, the cookies. Are. Amazing."}
{"text":"So I've been to Le Gourmand many, many times, and yet I've only ever eaten one item: their chocolate chip walnut cookie.  I mean, what can I say about these things that hasn't been said before? They're phenomenal (especially if you get a fresh one). Packed full of chocolate and walnuts, it's basically the perfect cookie. I've never had a cookie where each bite is just an explosion of flavor and pure joy in my mouth, and I honestly can't imagine ever eating a cookie that beats this one. It's phenomenal."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Super ambience coupled with wonderful food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good. But overpriced. Nice environment. Decent coffee and pantries but too much money for what you get."}
{"text":"I went in for a tea and a chocolatine which wasn't buttery flaky, rather it was really soft like fresh bread. I liked it.  They also had a specialty tea similar to Orange Pekoe. That cost me about $5.   My friends were complaining that the sandwiches and wraps were overpriced for their portions."}
{"text":"Le Gourmand has really good cookies and a brunch menu. We've been here numerous times for breakfast. But today was the biggest disappointment. We ordered the huevo dish and paid for it. The couple behind us ordered the same thing and were told that their order would take a while since they have to make more bean paste. 20 minutes later we're still waiting and they've given our order to the other couple. This is a horrible result of an unorganized ordering system. They've done this many times before because there is no order number and anyone who has ordered the same thing as you, can get up and pick up your order. Anyhow, once we told them, the girl behind the counter didn't care much. She returned our money with out an apology and a mean look and then quickly moved on to the next costumer. You pretty much feel like crap because of their service.   Along with being unorganized they've got poor communication behind the counter. We come here typically for their cookies, but unfortunately they only had one left. We asked how long till the next batch is out, they said about an hour. So we bought the last cookie, sat down, had a bite, and the next batch of fresh cookies were out. WTH, their cookies aren't cheap and aren't small so if you get one you're pretty much satisfied.   Overall, their food is good but when you get treated poorly, even the best food doesn't taste great. And you're not depriving yourself by not coming here. There are far more friendlier and better tasting cafés/restaurants in Toronto.  The one star is because I am happy with their food but would never step in because they treat their customers, who have been inconvenienced, very poorly."}
{"text":"My advice, GET THEIR CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE!  It was the most fresh- gooey, delicious chocolate chip cookie I have ever consumed in all of my existence.    Everyone on earth MUST try their chocolate chip cookie.  A side of regular drip coffee (large cup for only 1.70) was the cherry on top of the whole experience.  Simply loved everything about this place including its relaxing and artsy decor."}
{"text":"This place is very tasty. Great breakfast burritos and cookies. The problem is, their customer service is pretty shameful. Last time I went in there to get their famous chocolate chip cookies around opening time, but the said they wouldn't be ready until around 11am. Not wanting to wait around for 2 hours, I decided to come the next weekend (today). When I got here, they informed me the cookies wouldn't be ready until \"later in the afternoon\". I'm not sure if the baker just cooks them whenever they feel like it, but this kind of disorganization is really frustrating for regular customers.   This place would easily get 4-4.5 stars from me, but they don't really seem to care about making things convenient for their customers."}
{"text":"Le Gourmand is okaaaay.  The coffee is pretty good, and yes - those chocolate chip cookies are delicious and a meal in itself.  But, the service totally sucks.  I went in for a coffee and a sandwich as my office is right around the corner.  First I ordered the avocado and tomato sandwich, which they rang up for me but didn't have.  No biggie.  THEN,  I asked for the vegetarian sandwich (as I am a vegetarian).  They toast it up or whatever, I bite into it - and there is MEAT IN MY VEGETARIAN SANDWICH!  Ahhhhhhhh! (no offense to the meat eaters, but that is...ugh - not okay!!!).  I take it back to them saying \"hello, there is meat in my VEGETARIAN sandwich and I am a VEGETARIAN!!!\"  I got a very minimal, blase response from the girl at the counter.  She didn't seem to care much, gave me an obligatory apology, and poked around to find an actual vegetarian sandwich.  Poor customer service.   What if I had a food allergy? What if that was a religious problem for me?  They just don't care.  Aside from that, this place is just a little too faux for me.  It's a cute decor, but they try way too hard.  I'd hit the Dark Horse up the street instead.  Much cooler."}
{"text":"Loved this place. It's probably my new hang out place in Toronto. Loved the food, I had a nonfat vanilla chai latte with a veggie and chevre omelette. The food and drink were delicious. Only downside is that you have to wait at the counter for your food. It'd be nice if they could do like they do in so many places where they give you a number and deliver the food to your table. Apart from that, I thought the staff could have been a little more friendly, but the breakfast with no smile won't prevent me from going back. Overall, I recommend it and will certainly go back and try the wonderful looking baked goods and sandwiches they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Best cookie in the city!! Made the trip here from king and bay during a lunch break.  Got the chocolate walnut cookie. Was very well worth the trip to try this amazing masterpiece. Will definitely go back to try their other cookies and food."}
{"text":"Bittersweet Hot Chocolate, Coffee, Apple pastry, lemon pastry resembling a Breton Kouign-amann.  Butter and sugar baked to perfection.    This was a taste of home for my husband and I.  On entering, you're swept away to a European style bakery/cafe."}
{"text":"Used to come to le gourmand a lot due to work is close by . What I like about  this cafe is the variety and they cook everything all day long . So the popular items are super fresh . I had a fresh from oven cookies before and was in tears that I found the best chocolate chip you could think of .  Deep toffee caramel flavor and gooey chocoLate chunk in the center . Loaded with chocolate pieces it's true indulgence. Their pastries are French flair very attractive to the eyes ,nicely layout on the wooden board . For the few pastries I have tried are not bad .  The other pastry in the show case was brought some well known pastry shops .   My favorite sandwiches are roasted vegetables and pancetta with arugula . It's panni style so it's crispy and the cheese melt with all the flavors come together.   The worst I have tried so far is the vegetable quiche ,  looking very pretty . It's more like a Spanish omelette rather than quiche , the phyllo pastry definitely give it an interesting look in the edge but the whole thing is under seasoning and over cooked also you can't detect the goat cheese at all. Was disappointed . Thats why it's better to stick with what you like in the restaurant !!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a total gem.  So many times I've passed by this cafe and not noticed it.  The exterior seems very underwhelming.  Inside, the cafe looks a lot larger than I expected judging from the outside.  I came on a weekday around 11am and it wasn't packed or bustling, which makes it nice for a sit down work meeting.  They have coffee and an assortment of  pastries.  I was told their cookies are delicious and indeed they are!  They also have lunch options such as salads and sandwiches, which look like it can be heated up.  I'll be sure to try it next time I have a meeting there."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here because he promised me milk and cookies. He actually did some research on Yelp and found out that Le Gourmand makes some of the best cookies so he brought me here to surprise me. Little did he know that I have already tried their cookies and I think it's pretty good! Dipping the chocolate chip cookie is milk definitely completes the cookie experience!"}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience, a yelling match with the Manager back in September with a girlfriend.  The owner has since apologized for the this employee's behaviour.  I'll return eventually and see how a new experience will be like."}
{"text":"Cute small place with great coffee and delicious sandwiches...  Everything was delicious and service was very nice... Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I work by Le Gourmand and they've ordered trays of their baked goods/pastries and coffee multiple times and everything is so delicious. I've tried pretty much anything I can get my hands on and it's all been good. Even the desserts that don't look like much, and looked really simple are very good. The coffee has been great too!  I would totally recommend them for both I should try lunch there one day..."}
{"text":"Watch out - they will overcharge you!!   Their wall menu board say $2.00 for an Americana but they charge $2.80.  I confronted them and they said it was the new price for over a month.  They did not care that it was illegal to post one price and charge a higher one - told me to email the manager.  They also refused to charge me the posted price and the cashier just walked away saying it was not her problem.  Nice."}
{"text":"I have heard so many great things about Le Gourmand, but I'm just not feeling it.  I work in the area, and the food court can get a little boring at times, so I figured I would try the famed Le Gorumand.....I had the mac and cheese the other day and I have to say it was just meh.  It lacked flavour and it came with no sides.  If I'm paying $7 for mac and cheese it better come with something like a salad or I better be getting more then I can eat - both of which didn't happen.  I'm kind of a mac and cheese snob, my step mom makes THE BEST homemade mac and cheese and all are compared to hers.  When I saw it, it looked hot and very good - but no one had tried it yet - I figured I was just in time as it was only just noon.  It was dry and not hot at all.  The staff are very snobby and not considerate to the patrons at all - I HATE when someone who is serving you sees you yet continues to talk to their co-worker about how wasted they got last night - not cool.  I felt like screaming.  I will say that we have had Le Gourmand cater some work functions and their sandwiches are yummy, not big at all and I'm sure over priced, but yummy - try the brie and prosciutto.  Oh ya and everyone raves about their cookies, they are just meh too."}
{"text":"Went here because I decided to have a change in my typical morning routine of making my own cup of espresso and breakfast at home. Place is conveniently located outside of the streetcar. There was an adequate amount of seating and there was a very homey feel to the place.  Ordered a macchiato with the walnut choco chip as my breakfast appetizer. Cookie was soft, chewy and gooey. Into the main of a bacon egg and cheese croissant. Croissant was flakey and rich in flavour. Had a breakfast dessert of pancakes and French toast. Definitely something sweet. Overall a great experience and left with great satisfaction."}
{"text":"This place is elegantly decorated. I love how they incorporate food items in the decor and the chalk written menu. A nice place to grab a coffee with a friend for a heart to heart conversation. Any size of tea is the same price...fantastic!"}
{"text":"Came here to grab a quick lunch, but unfortunately, it wasn't too quick.   I ordered my sandwich at the register. The best way to describe the service here is that it's very bland and transaction. My friend who ordered -after- me received her order in about 10 minutes. After 15 minutes, I asked about my order and apparently they flat out forgot. It's fine that people make mistakes, but it would be nice if the people working had the mental capacity to question why I was standing by the counter doing nothing for so long. Oh well.  The sandwich and coffee were delicious. After reading so much about their cookies, I was excited to try one, but was a bit disappointed. They were good, but not worth of the \"Best in Toronto\" title. However, my batch may have been overcooked, as reviews here describe them as \"slightly undercooked\" on the inside and moist throughout. My cookie was hard and dry on the outside, with a slight chew on the inside."}
{"text":"It was delicious from beginning to end.  I had 3 courses and there was not a morsel left of any of them.  Great service, too."}
{"text":"Am at brunch here and the atmosphere is very New York City sheek!! I ordered the Veggie and Chives Omelet along with an organic chamomile tea my husband ordered their famous chicken and egg roti with srilankan hash and cappuccino...it was all delicious!! All for $22.00! Will be back here again!"}
{"text":"This is a cosy little spot on a nondescript stretch of Spadina. Food and service are both generally solid, and the coffee is pretty good. I definitely want to try the hot chocolate, which sounds amazing. My only gripe is that, without asking, they always give you your coffee and pastries in paper cups and bags. I looked around recently and everyone sitting in the place had a paper takeout cup. Why do they do this? For one thing it's extremely wasteful/environmentally unfriendly, and for another, when I'm paying over seven bucks for a small coffee and a pastry, I'd like an actual china cup and a plate.... too much to ask?"}
{"text":"Nice cafe to hang out in but extremely over priced. Staff is always friendly as well. Spent $6 on a small white hot chocolate which was extremely overpriced for the average taste. They also won best chocolate chip cookie of 2017 and these now sell out quickly - surprisingly quite good and not overpriced (maybe $2ish). Highly recommended if you are to order one item from there as it was soft and chewy."}
{"text":"Still terrible. Service is still rude and incompetent. I met a friend here for a coffee at her suggestion and ordered an Earl Grey tea and... They gave me a green tea??? I can see it was an honest mistake but the girl behind the counter was so cold that I didn't even bother to ask for my proper order. AVOID. Plenty of other nice and friendly coffee shops in the area!"}
{"text":"We went here on a recommendation. The cappuccino was excellent. A croissant sandwich and an avocado and cheese sandwich were also crispy and tasty. Don't forget the chocolate soufflé for dessert. Even if it is breakfast."}
{"text":"Service is mediocre but helpful. For $12 for a sandwich and salad I was expecting a bit more. It's average tasting and not good value. The sandwiches are super thin (the bread is flattened pretty flat in the grill). Not bad. Organic options which keeps this from falling below 3 stars. The brownies are disgusting. No wifi in case that mattered (though it did not affect my star rating)."}
{"text":"If you like lemon desserts, you must try the Lemon Bichon at Le Gourmand!  Perfectly balanced between tart and sweet, the filling is lemon deliciousness and the outer crust is flaky with a crunchy caramelized exterior.  My favourite!  However, if lemon is not your thing, there are so many other treat options it makes it hard to decide.  From fresh baked gooey chocolate chip cookies, to the hilariously named \"nookie cookie\" (another chocolate lovers dream) and danishes and other goodies, all high quality and worth the price and extra time at the gym!  They also serve breakfast, lunch and brunch on weekends."}
{"text":"Random fact: My first work lunch living in Toronto as a young professional was here. Still thankful it was free because I was poor as hell at the time!   Anyway, I am not sure why it has only above average reviews. For a cafe/lunch spot, it rivals the best in the city! My guess is:   a) place is always busy and lunch garbage is everywhere b) they've never had a chocolate walnut cookie c) couldn't figure out the wifi password  Whatever it is, I do want to reiterate B) they've never had a chocolate walnut cookie!!! This thing is ridiculously good and I don't even like sweets.   My advice is, try a cookie, and then decide. While you're at it, try a sandwich, and other baked goodies. You'll be glad you did it."}
{"text":"The staff is surly, but the cookies are the best damn cookies you'll ever put in  your mouth."}
{"text":"amazing coffee/bakery shop! on the weekend, i like to go here for brunch and get their french toast which is to die for! my go tos for this place is an almond croissant with spiced chai latte. their croissants are small but big in flavours. and i normally don't drink chai latte but their twist (spiced) is so hard to resist! i would prefer this place over what a bagel which is a few steps down the street because of the free wifi and it's not as crowded"}
{"text":"Very classy place, I ate her for lunch with a work group and we all enjoyed ourselves on the outdoor area.  Good seafood, great wine list and service was friendly."}
{"text":"Quelle belle surprise en découvrant ce resto de Pointe-Claire!  Immeuble de pierre, très chaleureux, au service hors-pair et très aimable!  La cuisine est française mais avec une touche très \"été\" ou californienne.  La soupe froide Vichyssoise valait le coup, de même que le filet mignon avec pinces de crabe, très bien réussi!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks! Great brunch, we had the ricotta blueberry lemon pancakes...tastes like heaven! Then...drumroll....long behold the chocolate chip cookie!!!! Man other people's reviews aren't joking...it is the best chocolate chip cookie EVER!!!!! Amazing! Can't wait to come back for more!! Very friendly staff as well...highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The mythical chocolate chip cookies had a 30 minute wait for them!! How could you be open and not have your famed cookies?? So this review is only take out for 2 other baked goods.  Though I'm side eyeing them for not having their CCC, I won't ding them for it.  Le Gourmand has been around on the Toronto scene for a long time.  I think yelp reviews go back for 8 years at least ... in the retail world, that's a lifetime and a half.  Clearly they're doing something good.  With a lot of baked goods on display and a constant line, they have their patrons keep coming back.  The cafe is part take out and part sit down cafe.  When we went on a Sunday late morning,  it was packed and filled with brunchers.  There is only one person at the cash so the line up does take a while to go through.    Their offering is from baked goods to sandwiches to espresso drinks.  I was only interested in their cookies.  Seeing how they didn't have of their  famed chocolate chip cookies, I decided to try two of their other baked goods ... the nookie cookie (chocolate crinkle) and their Breton cake.  Nookie cookie - I'm not sure how this got their name but I was told the chocolate cookie covered in powdered sugar was the \"nookie\".  It's brownie dense and fudgey with a crispy sugared crust that breaks into white shards as you eat it.  This is a really great version of the chocolate crinkle cookie.  4/5  Breton cake - if a buttery shortbread had a baby with a custard tart, it would be this.  Buttery tender in the middle with still a firm crust, this isn't a cake as much as it is a giant butter short bread.  The custard isn't runny but rather it's like a dense and creamy vanilla pudding.  For a cookie, it's not overly sweet so it's a nice baked food for those who don't want a sugar high.  4/5  I feel the price is a tad high as 2 small cookies and a tart was over $13.  BUT for the occasional treat, the nookie cookie and Breton cake was enjoyable.  Most places don't get the texture right on their cakes but these were good.  Maybe next time I step, I could try those CCC finally."}
{"text":"There are places in which you feel home, waiters and staff are nice, food is good, fresh and everything makes you conclude that you will come back.  Well, this place is NOT a place like that. Not at all. Young inexperienced students / servers and staff who have absolutely no idea how customers should be dealt with, nor even what they exactly sell here...  Cookies look good, but most are stale, and waitress/cashier will only try to sell you the oldest, stalest ones, rather than the fresh ones... business is business... with no long term envision at all...   Chocolate mi-cuits are good, focus on that, and try to get a fresh one... the waitress may grumble... but anyhow, whether you are nice or not, she will not even try be nice anyhow... AVOID"}
{"text":"Came here in the afternoon, the service was really good and I got a hold of one of their best cookies and wow, it did live up to my standards! It was baked and left there for awhile but I cannot imagine how delicious it would taste right out of the oven...*salivating* haha besides that, the latte was good  as it had a strong kick to it. This cafe has great seating, the atmosphere makes me feel like I stepped into a European cafe, I saw lots of people studying and chatting with other people."}
{"text":"Le Gourmand is a reliable place to grab a quick snack or lunch when in the entertainment district. It has a bakery shop feel blended with a deli or cafe appeal. When I'm feeling adventurous, I pop in here to fulfill my sweet tooth or have a sandwich."}
{"text":"Bought small take out Cobb salad. The dressing was so yummy! Tangy and flavourful - what is your secret le gourmand??"}
{"text":"ugh I really wish I don't have to leave a bad review for this place. I have been coming here for years and I have brought in so many more customers for this place personally that I introduced this place to all my close friends when they would always walk by n straight to Starbucks next door . This place was shut down for 3 months due to not able to pay store rent in 2009-2010,i try to help n come more.  I hv had 2 separated incidents in this place that disgruntle  employees are being rude. First time was in summer, when I just adopted a small Yorkie puppy that he was only 4 months old weight 4 pounds at time. when I was looking into the store window, a couple at patio liked my puppy so much offered to look after him at end side of patio in exchange that they get to pat him. my puppy is very small dude and he doesn't bark or bite. So instead of tying my puppy to the patio pole I left to the couple who's enjoying coffee at their patio chair. I quickly ran in to try to get my big usual chocolate chunk cookie asap but there was a line up that I had to line for about 5 minutes. During that time I kept checking on puppy on the patio window trying to make sure everything is okay. I got the cookies n were about to come out, a women (first I thought was a man first) with very shirt hair like buzz cut came up screaming (in a very public harsh n grunting voice, EXTREMELY DEGRATING) : \"YOU KNOW YOU ARENT ALLOWED TO HAVE DOGS IN PATIO?\" I was in shock wasn't because I was wrong was it was so unforsceen n someone shouted at me out of nowhere in public. The line of people standing beside me were like\"what's going on\". She rambled something else after in the same mannar, I don't remember what she said but was definitely VERY SELF RIGHTES AND CONDESENDING, her face reassemble with some with heartrate. I quickly grab my stuff n left . Feeling very HURT. I brought in SO MANY more customers when I developed a liking to this place. I brought at least 10 friends here to have them try this place n telling how good their cookeis are. And what I got was being LECTURED IN FRONT OF MASS AUDIANCE! I thought it was fine I had my puppy tied up in patio , he was pocket size clearly would do no harm. I only had him for a month it was my first dog I had no idea about patio laws prior. Just come up pull me aside to give me heads up, instead of yelling cross the room in public! This is Canada for god sake, what are ppl's manners.   I didn't come to the bakery for a month after that incident. Just left a very sour taste after that time n makes me cringe every time I walk by the store.   Finally time heals wounds, one day I passed by I decided to bring some cookie to friends and I walked in. I mentioned an employee n asked who was that short hair manly person that's so angry. Not saying trying to bash her looks, u really have no idea if she is a man or not just by looking at her. They confirmed that she is a chef at location, not the boss, also a VERY grumpy person to work with n didn't know why she would come to the front to yell at customers because she was suppose to stay at back. So I left at that assume she was having a bad day and came to the front and saw something she didn't like n happened to yell at me.   Second incident is its a few months apart, I came in one day before store closing. They had full tray of baked pear and apple pastries. I was normally getting a cookie but decided to take a tart too. The lady was annoyed when I asked her how much it was, it was mildly annoyed. Then I kinda debated between the two tarts, when I finally decided to go with pear, she grabe me a small dry piece from the edge of the tray. I don't like dry pastries so I asked her to switch to a middle piece. then she tried to shovel the tart n cookie in the same white small tinny paper bag I had to request please put them in separate bag, and toss in a plastic bag too because their pastries are greasy n they always soak through paper bag . She was increasingly irritated n I could tell she was thinking I gave her hard time on purpose. The final bill came $8.91 something which was like wow! for a cookie and small piece pear thing! I double asked her how much it was for the tart, she was like : $4.99. when I say the tart. I guess its called tart, its like 2.5x2.5 x0.8 inch high flaky crossant like texture pastry. it was like $5.61 I ate the whole thing in 4 bites. I was suspicious of if she over charged me so I asked how much it was she said :\"$5.99  last night I came to the location to get a cookie they had the exact same thing and she was there too. after I bought a cookie I asked her how much that pear pastry was. she was like:$3.99! Bang   This place has great pastries and great coffee. However I would not want to stay here. They seem to have high turn over of store front employees who don't take their job seriously. They also have angry employee at back comes to front to throw a tantrum at \"young looking face\" customers. Its totally not acceptable."}
{"text":"Stopped by here meaning to get a mocha but the hot chocolate menu captured me instead. I got the french caramel hot chocolate and it's so freaking good. It's not too sweet and they actually steam caramel chocolates into the milk, none of that powder/chocolate sauce nonsense. Only problem: I've gotten it twice so far and I think they over-steam the milk - probably because the chocolate has to fully melt, so watch out during your first sip!"}
{"text":"Looking back on my reviews, I'm usually strictest in my critique when it comes to pricier restaurants. I think it's only fair to readers that restaurants be held to the promises their positioning makes. With this in mind, Le Gourmand is one choice that does not disappoint. I enjoyed salmon tartar that was balanced better in its flavors than any I've had in the past. The recommended white whine pairing (the exact name escapes me) made a pleasant meal divine. The cherry on top of the sundae was the view of the fireworks, to which we were privy having sat on the terrace. It almost felt selfish enjoying my girlfriend's birthday as much as she did."}
{"text":"It's the best cookie in Toronto. Crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. There's not much more to say. Go get one."}
{"text":"Came here by accident. The chocolate lava cake was wonderful as well as the latte.  However the latte art was very. XD I don't know how to describe, plz see my picture hahahahaha"}
{"text":"Everyone mentions the chocolate chip cookies here, but they're way too sweet and oily to me. What I really liked was the almond croissants - nice and light. The Dominican hot chocolate was also good - light and creamy - but it could have done with a bit more chocolate taste."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, handmade soups, salads, and sandwiches, and tempting pastries. This place has everything you need for a quick snack on the go or cozy bite to stay.   You may find yourself tempted to source the same goods at the Starbucks chain next door - and the staff there are usually lovely, so you wouldn't be making a big mistake - but I'm a local spot gal at heart, and that's a big part of why this place has mine. I love seeing all the staff here making soup and quiche, stacking freshly made sandwiches in the display case, and filling bowls with various salads to order.   This space is big and airy but also cozy and vaguely Parisian inside. You can usually find your standard mix of laptop workers, meeting takers, and friends meeting for a coffee and catch-up. So go ahead, check it out. I was pleasantly surprised by Le Gourmand and I bet you will be too."}
{"text":"What to try??  Their famous chocolate chip cookies!!   Comes in two choices: the chocolate chip or the chocolate chip and walnut. I usually get walnut one because I like the extra crunch but the chocolate chip one is just as good. Mmmmm...especially when it's freshly out of the oven and the chocolate chip is still oozing out, the cookie has a crunch but soft inside and it comes in a good chunky size.   Their other baked goods are good too like the devils mini chocolate cake but le Gourmand, they are well known for their chocolate chip cookies. Everyone who is a fan of this cafe is well aware of that. :)  Last tip?  It can be easy to Miss this place because it's next to a convenience store but don't forget about remembering this might be a good choice to come for breakfast or a weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"Fifth time I've come here after 1pm and been offered no options for food. Sold out of cookies, sold out of all sandwiches and specials.  Why stay open till 7pm daily if you're constantly running out of food? Save yourself the staffing and operational costs by closing immediately after the weekday lunch rush.  Another way to tell that they're sold out of food is that no one will help you at the cash. I practically had to go back into the kitchen and bring out an employee myself. The attitude seems to be \"We're out of stock of pretty much everything, so there's no point in even greeting you since we'll decline every request you make.\" I get the impression they hope customers will take a hint and not even bother asking?  TIP: Make more food?"}
{"text":"This is the best chocolate chip cookie I HAVE EVER TRIED. I have not tried anything else from here so I can't speak to that. But the cookie is a magical mix of soft and crispy and it is HUGE."}
{"text":"I found myself at Le Gourmand after work one day because I was hankering for a good chocolate chip cookie, like any hot-blooded Canadian girl.  After doing some reading online I was a little paranoid that they'd be sold out, but thankfully, they weren't.  I must say, they were very, very good cookies.  But one star off because they were quite burnt and another star off because the middle is a little raw-er than I'd normally like.  I'm one of those weird people who'd rather have a cookie be overbaked than raw, because raw dough skeeves me out.  If the outside of a cookie is burnt and the inside is raw, I think the baker shouldn't try to be overambitious by building up the height of the cookie.    The cookie base was great.  The ingredients were great quality.  They were generous with the chocolate.  The cookies were massive and, as I mentioned, sky-high.  But I really didn't like that they were burnt.  I ripped off the bottom thirds of my cookies as a result, and for a pricey $3 cookie...that just didn't sit well with me.    By the way, these cookies are $3 each, which is expensive, but they're also huge, heavy, and filling.  These are definitely made for sharing.  The chocolate chip & walnut cookies were tasty, though I think I prefer the regular chocolate chip.  I would definitely return though, because their other options look appealing and try-worthy!"}
{"text":"Le Gourmand est delicieux.   I used to work across from Le Gourmand, and on the not-so-rare occasion when I would choose to splurge and gorge myself at lunchtime, I'd hop across the street and choose from their adorable chalkboard menu. I still hunt out their lattes when I'm in the hood.  They always have lots of hot specials along with a variety of salads, quiches and sandwiches. I am a big fan of the ham and cheese quiche and beet salad. They also make nice pasta and pot pie specials. Delish.  This joint doubles as a small french grocer and cafe, and makes a great latte. Which is good, because after a carbo-load I can really use some caffeine. Ya feel me?   I usually take things to go but they do have small bistro-style tables along the edges of the interior.   PEPPER POINTS: For when they have their Mac and Cheese special. Gourmet Mac and Cheese is the best."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of this place.  I would've given it 5 stars, but I'd like to come back and try more of their food before I assign 5 stars.  The ambiance is fantastic.  I haven't been in France, but it's certainly how I *imagine* a French cafe would be.  Very earthy and bohemian.  Good spacing between tables, however the place is busy, so despite the spacing, I wouldn't take a date here (except to take out a giant cookie to share or something).  I've read reviews that say the people who work here give bad service and are unfriendly.   I haven't witnessed this myself.  The worst I can say about the service is that it *can* be slow at times and that sometimes it's adequate -- they do their job and that's it.  No spontaneous smiles or small talk.   I think one reviewer got it spot on when she said the service here can be hit or miss.  In comparison, the people who work at the Starbucks next door are friendly, chatty and flirty.  Too bad!  Perhaps the owner of Le Gourmand should try to steal Starbucks' employees!  Coffee is good.  Very nice flavor.  My preference is for something stronger, but it's certainly stronger than most coffee places you see.  When Starbucks next door brews, say, a Verona blend or a French Roast blend, Starbucks will be stronger.  However, other than Starbuck's darker blends, the coffee here is about on par with a typical Starbucks bold blend.   The difference is, of course, is that it's about 50 cents cheaper here than Starbucks.  Of course, you can get super cheap refills at Starbucks, so if you plan on getting refills, Starbucks is the better place to go.  If not, then I'd come here.  The Americano was NOT bitter as one reviewer commented.  It was a typical Americano.  If anything, I wish it were more bitter.  I thought it was weak for an Americano.  Note: the Yelp entry says WiFi is free here.  I don't think Le Gourmand has WiFi, however, Starbucks WiFi from next door does reach this restaurant very nicely.  I'm pretty sure they were on Starbucks WiFi without knowing it.   Food Reviews: ============ Croissant w/Cheddar, Bacon and Egg: A+ Yes, that's right.  A+.  I almost never give A+.  For something to get an A+, I will want to have it again, and again, and again.  I need to think back and say \"You know?  That food I had 2 weeks ago really kicked ass!\".  Their breakfast croissant w/cheddar, bacon, and egg qualifies for this coveted position.  It is one of my favorite breakfasts anywhere.   I think about it for days.  Get it grilled.  You'll be in heaven.  I plan on trying some of their cookies and quiche.  Once I do, I'll update this review.  If they're nearly as good as the breakfast croissant, this will be a 5 star restaurant!"}
{"text":"So I've gone here for brunch and don't even remember what I ordered but I'm sure it was great but THAT COOKIE!!!! I literally go just for the cookie.  It's the best thing in the world. Probably a billion calories but worth every bite!! It's incredible and ooey and gooey and perfect and if you haven't tried it you need to go like right now.  Pro tip- Portland variety sells the same one!! No excuses!! Try it."}
{"text":"I went in today to pick up their famous chocolate chip cookie, as I hadn't had one in a while but had been craving one. Sadly, they were out, so I got an oatmeal raisin cookie instead. I can't say it was the same quality as their chocolate chip cookie. It was over baked and had a bit of a burnt taste to it. It wasn't worth the money.   I think what bothered me more was the cold customer service from one of the ladies behind the counter. Something as simple as a hello back, instead of a cold stare waiting for my order, would have had me leave feeling more positively about my experience. It didn't exactly make me feel welcome as a customer or want to go back any time soon. Small things make a huge difference when it comes to the customer experience.   I won't give up on Le Gourmand because their chocolate chip cookie is bomb, but today's experience was a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Le Gourmand seems to be very well-known for their seriously gigantic cookies.  My first bakery love is croissants, but I'm always unfortunately tempted by cookies as well.    When I came in, I saw a handful of people sitting around with their laptops so when I ordered my cookie, I asked about if they had wi-fi. The guy behind the counter says \"Yah we do, sort of.  Well...Starbucks is right beside us so we can use their wi-fi through the wall!\"  Awesome, thanks, I'll use it!  Sitting area is pretty comfy and laid-back. They sell what seems to be imported European goods so it was interesting to just browse through their shop.    So I got their chocolate chip cookie, which is about the size of my palm and pretty thick.  First couple nibbles were really good, I like the crispy parts along the outside so I eat all of that first.  Then I start nibbling into the cookie and after a while, I'm getting kind of sick of it. There's nothing really wrong with it, but there is A LOT of chocolate chips (I know I know it's a chocolate chip cookie) but the batter inside still has that uncooked cookie dough mushy texture. It's O.K. but I guess it's not what I like my cookies to be like."}
