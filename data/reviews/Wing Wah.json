{"text":"The food was horrible.  It didn't taste fresh at all and my kids wouldn't touch the chicken.  The rice literally tasted like plastic.  How do they mess up crab Rangoon? Yuck!!!"}
{"text":"We love Wing Wah! The lady is always super friendly, and always remembers me and sends extra fortune cookies for my daughter, even if she's not with me. We almost always pickup, but they have delivered a few times. I always get the sweet and sour chicken... it's some of the best I've had. My husband and child usually split either chicken and veggies or shrimp and veggies; we always customize and add cashews, and they are always accommodating. The egg rolls are amazing. They love the crab Rangoon, as well. 

Overall, we like it here, and this is our go-to Chinese food place."}
{"text":"Can't believe I caved and tried again. Terrible communication and unfriendly, food is a d plus, still has not improved over a few years."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over a year and have watched the service continue to decrease.  If you order takeout they always say 15 minutes, be prepared to wait for at least 45.  They have recently changed their hours to open at 4, today I went there at 4:20 and they still weren't open.  Finally at 4:27 the cook and owner arrive and of course tell me my order will take 15 minutes.  By 5:10 I still had not received my order (was the only person there) and asked for a refund.  Will not be going to Wing Wah anymore.  It's unfortunate because the food is pretty good but the owner (lady always working I assume) could care less about the service or the amount of flies in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Very solid Chinese food, best in the area. I've had better but this does rank up there. We normally get the General Tso and the Moo Goo Gai Pan (both with fried rice) and it's consistently good. The quality of the meat is high, which is unfortunately rare for Chinese takeout. I've never dined in but the owner is very nice every time I'm in there."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Chinese food for the area.  They deliver and I really like their pork fried rice and egg rolls.  Not the best I have ever had but we order there pretty regularly."}
{"text":"food was good, but service and atmosphere is much to be desired!!
Cold and noisey, not very friendly waitress/hostess and never enough ice in your water"}
{"text":"Communication with staff was difficult and apparently we are outside of their delivery area (in Northfield) because she asked if we could pick up. 

I had General Tso's Tofu. Nothing spectacular, but good. My husband said the pork fried rice and sweet and sour chicken was good, definitely better than most strip mall restaurants. 

We'll order again when we want a quick dinner."}
{"text":"Our new take out place.  Pretty quick with the food.  Good amount for a fair price.  Only knock is their egg drop soup.  Broth is very thick.  Texture isn't right for that soup for my taste.  Worth the drive from where I live."}
{"text":"Overall: Very decent Chinese food.

Food: The sweet and sour chicken had very good chicken; the sauce was decent but didn't have any vegetables.  The pork fried rice is decent.  The Mongolian beef was very good.  The egg rolls were very good.  The won ton soup is better than average.

Atmosphere: Even though they have tables, it's generally a take-out place.

Prices: About average."}
{"text":"I walked in and made a to-go order on a random Wednesday night for myself and some friends.  I was greeted right away by a lady working there and a completely empty dining room (It was about 5 pm).  I took a quick look-see at the menu, and the lady was very nice, asking me what I like and making suggestions.  Of course, it has all the typical things any Chinese take-out place would have.  I made my order and let her know I was going to run down the street, fill up my gas tank and be right back, which of course she was cool with.  She was really, super nice and if I were to go back, it would be just because of the good customer service she gave me.
When I got back, my food was ready for pick up. It was in regular Styrofoam boxes, not your typical Chinese takeout boxes, which bummed me out a little bit...I love those little Chinese takeout boxes. Now, for what I ordered...

Fried Dumplings: Very good. Came with soy sauce packets instead of a ramekin of sauce other places give, so I had to find a bowl to put the sauce in to dunk, but, whatever,

Chicken teriyaki: No. Don't order. No flavor whatsoever.  Not good. The pieces of chicken were huge, looks like they didn't really take the time to cut them up to make them more manageable...good thing I wasn't using chopsticks...that would not have worked.

Eggroll: I really don't like eggrolls, but I was craving one.  It was so good. Yummmm
My buddy got the crab rangoon, he said he wasn't a fan.  He also got the general tsao, which he was was ehhh.

For cheap Chinese takeout, might as well try it."}
