{"text":"This restaurant offers the Mediterranean regulars at a decent price. The interior deco gives off a diner vibe but the food is of good quality. The owner offered an appetizer on the house, a nice gesture but to be honest it was terrible, some sort of yogurts with pita. Thankfully the main courses were fresh and well plated as I had the lamb dish and it was cooked to order as I could tell. This a new restaurant and it showed with the inexperienced service, it was not impolite, just a lack of experience. Overall it is a good restaurant but it will need some work before being able to compete with some other contenders cropping up in the area."}

{"text":"I've been here a couple times and I really like it.  It's not in the best location as it's next to a gas station.  However, the food is really good and made fresh.  The owner of Aegean Grill always spoils his guests with extra treats and is very welcoming and hospitable.  I've had the chicken souvlaki twice and it's been amazing.  They have really good saganaki and a specialty dessert crepe that is simple but quite elegant.  Laurence has the best schnitzel I have ever tasted."}
