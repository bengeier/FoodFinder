{"text":"We had read about executive chef Jinhee Lee winning the 2017 Canadian Culinary awards and knew we had to come here. The restaurant stayed full past 10:00 pm so reservations are recommended. 

Atmosphere: 
Not too loud. Sat by the kitchen and watched all the dishes come out.   

Albacore tuna carpaccio-nice and light. Very refreshing served with crispy fried onions for crunchy texture. 

Soy garlic caramel roasted eggplant - nice thick slices with pickled vegetables and herbs. Meaty eggplant that makes your tongue dance. Nice hint of sweetness. 

Char sui pork with foie gras steam buns- their signature dish. Served with cucumber, pickled kimchi, sliced compressed Pear, hoisin based sauce. Fantastic!  

Beef tenderloin forbidden fried rice-break the onsen egg and mix into the rice. Touch of truffle oil and lemongrass. 

Vietnamese coffee parfait-if you like dark chocolate go for it

Passion fruit mango cheesecake-toasted coconut on the sides. Side of vanilla ice cream on passion fruit. Wow this was great. 

Our second visit here so we are fans of chef Jinhee and of course the food!"}
{"text":"One word... Amazing!
If you are looking for a date night or sharing plates with your friends this is the place for that. I am drooling thinking about the hanging steak right now. The steamed buns are to die for. Lemon chicken like you have never tasted before. The staff are professional, polite, educated on what they are serving you. And the atmosphere is welcoming. Price is average and well worth every dollar. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Going to agree with Angelo for the most part: the real winners here are the sharing plates. I would consider a couple of the large plates to be sharing plates too, specifically the steam buns and the fried rice, which along with the crispy chicken tatami and poke small plates. The large plate beef exemplifies a dish that is executed properly but disappointing by comparison to the others with regards to pricing and flavour pop. There is definitely a lot of thought and work that goes into a dish like the fried rice with onset egg, with a great balance of earthy, herbaceous and sour tones. The char siu pork was just as good, with home made pickled vegetables balancing the fatting pork belly, and the foie gras helping justify the price tag. The strong Asian flavourings of the crispy chicken and tataki beef were a nice change of pace from subtle versions of these dishes at other restaurants. The poke had good flavour but a too soft texture, though the homemade crisps has a great texture. If you've got some money burning a hole in your pocket, and some friends who enjoy sharing, check this place out."}
{"text":"Dropped in last minute for date night.  Despite the place being quite busy (at 6:45pm on a Friday!) we were able to get a table for two without a problem.  The space is open and airy and casual.  The menu is split between smaller sharing plates and larger plates.  We ordered 4 small plates and rice for two people.

Lemon chicken
Beef tatake
Eggplant
Spring rolls
And lime coconut rice

Our waitress brought the plates out slowly, one at a time, then three at the end.  Everything was delicious.  I especially loved the tatake and the eggplant.  My hubby liked the lemon chicken.

Spring rolls were okay, sort of tasted like meatballs in egg rolls. 

Great service.  Only thing that kept me from giving it a 5 was the fact that the food could have come out faster.  We were no longer hungry by the time the eggplant, egg rolls and rice came out (about an hour after we had initially ordered).  I would space the plates closer together next time.

Would go back. There were more menu items that I am curious to try!"}
{"text":"Checking out up & coming venues can be a hit or miss, and unfortunately for Foreign Concept - it was a miss.

Understandably, there will always be some wrinkles to iron out when a business opens (we were offered complimentary wine due to a hiccup in their liquor license), and I had high hopes that there would finally be a good Asian fusion restaurant in Calgary but was left disappointed.

Encouraged to have a \"family style\" experience, we ordered a few small plates and a couple big plates to share amongst ourselves. The Vietnamese style Scotch egg and miso baked sweet potato with cheese curds (I imagined a poutine!) were interesting concepts and well received with us. The salmon floss in the Thai style butternut squash slaw was overwhelming as the fishiness was the only thing you could taste after a couple bites. 

Thinking the veggies listed with the lemongrass chicken could tide over our vegetarian friend, it arrived with dollops of puree (for $26 you'd think you'd get actual vegetables) so we had to put in an order for gai lan for her. 

Granted, four huge prawns were served with the wild gulf big plate, but they were served \"Asian style\" (aka heads and shells still attached) and I could see how this was slightly off putting for my friends.

Asian flavoring has a boldness that can enhance the taste & aroma of food, but only when the right balance is used. I think once that's figured out here at Foreign, people will become more receptive to the dishes."}
{"text":"I had high expectations when I came here because it's fairly new and the owner is apparently supposed to be  amazing. I don't know if it was the high expectations that left me feeling like there was going to be more to the experience than what I got, or if it really is that dismal. 

Myself and my girlfriends tried it out and ordered a bunch of plates to share but there wasn't much to eat. And we ordered a lot! The items on the menu sounded really delicious but when they got to the table we thought, ok... Where is the rest? Add to that the pricing was high, which we expected, but we definitely didnt get  what we paid for. I get that it's a fancy new restaurant, but it seems to be hype.  We ended up having to go out for pizza after because we were starving.

I will say however, the drinks we had were sooooo good(Vietnamese coffee, as recommended by previous reviewer), we got a table right away, and the service was super friendly and made it a better experience."}
{"text":"Food was ok but not what I was expecting based on its high rating in the country for top restaurants. Went for lunch. Maybe dinner has the better menu"}
{"text":"I wanted to really enjoy Foreign Concept and waited for weeks before going, but found it not that unique and expensive for what you get. Being Vietnamese myself, didn't find the descriptions for the Vietnamese inspired dishes accurate... We ordered a couple of small plates and a couple of big plates to share. Was expecting more flavour from the yuzu cured salmon fresh rolls but was not bad. Miso sweet potato poutine was a bit better but was missing something to round out the dish. The char shiu pork and foie gras steamed buns were pretty good and the best part of the meal. Recommend these for sure if going to the restaurant. We also ordered the trout - the fish itself was done well (not cha ca per the menu?) but the rice noodles they came with were lacking in seasoning and were oily. We were thrown off by the persimmon chutney on the trout as it didn't jive with the other components in the dish...

Presentation was beautiful for all dishes. The restaurant was nicely decorated and had a good atmosphere. Service was great throughout and short wait times for food and drinks. I had the sweet temper cocktail (was average) and royal Jamaican ginger beer (delicious!). 

Overall wasn't blown away but it was good."}
{"text":"Service is good. The menu is fairly mixed though the flavours aren't quite exotic, they are trying to play it a bit on the plain side for a 'fusion' concept. The menu falls a bit short on the beverages (wine/cocktails) side though they have a full bar."}
{"text":"We came to Calgary for my birthday and I wanted to try this place so badly after hearing about them on Twitter. I think the ideas are good, but the execution just didn't do it for me.

The space itself is pretty and the staff were friendly. We were seated in the dining room (the lounge side seems a bit more casual, but they both share the same menu) and we had a direct view of the kitchen from our table. Starting off, I had the bourbon Vietnamese coffee, and let me tell you - it was delicious. Pricy, but this is a fancier Asian restaurant, after all.

I was curious to see how they took simple, homestyle dishes that I grew up on and elevated them to \"fine dining\" - let's be clear here. This is not a typical inexpensive Asian restaurant so it is definitely pricier than say, going to Chinatown. Which we expected. But with the caveat that if you're going to be charging that much, I want it to be elevated - I want to taste why you're charging me 2-3x more for something that I can get at an \"authentic\" place for bigger portions and less money.

We tried the beef tataki (tasty - you could taste that it was a good quality beef they used, but the sauce it was in could have used more flavour) followed by the bulgogi imperial rolls (crispy fried spring rolls that was in dire need of salt or other flavour with lettuce and daikon kimchi to make your own wraps. Texturally, I liked these, but it was so very very bland.) For our mains we did the fisherman's stew (again, lots of fresh tasting ingredients, but no flavour anywhere. There was also two pieces of Chinese doughnut that was blackened with squid ink - which, surprise surprise, also had no flavour) and the ling cod claypot (this was pretty good, but I'm also in love with ling cod - it was cooked very well and there was a decent sized piece of fish in the pot alongside peppers and rice cakes. The rice cakes were a really weird edition to it - this is definitely not something I'm used to in Vietnamese food - maybe Korean - but it didn't compliment the dish in any way)

I think it's ok - it's not amazing, and it's not terrible, but I wanted it to be so much more."}
{"text":"Amazing small plates and cocktails, but I felt their big plate menu left me questioning the value for the size of the dishes. Their poke with tapioca crisps were great bites, along with the sweet potato glazed with miso. The squash and green mango salad were a perfect summer salad bite.

But maybe it's because I was Asian but I felt like the fisherman's stew was a bit overpriced for something that's inherently a peasant dish. It's flavorful and the seafood was fresh (which is maybe why the dish cost 27$) but the portion wasn't that much more that our small plates.

I'd like to go back again with hopes of trying the steamed buns and their charcuterie menu."}
{"text":"I picked Foreign Concept for my birthday dinner. I was impressed with how smoothly the restaurant ran, from the hostess, servers to the food runners. On a Friday night, the entire restaurant was full, and it seemed to get busier as the night wore on. I liked that even though it was packed, the servers weren't rushing customers out after they finished their meal.

The music was good, it was chill and upbeat. The volume was loud enough that you felt energized and felt like you were \"out\" but you could still carry a conversation without shouting. Drinks were reasonably priced and there was something for everyone. My husband enjoyed the Tokyo Direct from Last Best Brewery, a hoppy beer.

The food was imaginative and delicious. We ordered the sweet potato cheese dish, salmon roll, Scotch egg, and Alberta trout. One of my favourite dishes was the salmon fresh roll, the ikura literally made this dish pop with the taste of the sea. The Scotch egg was another winner. The trout was perfectly cooked. This was the first time my husband and I tried trout and enjoyed eating it.

The whole time I was eating, I was thinking of the line in Zoolander when Jacobim Mugatu kept saying about Hansel, \"He's so hot right now\". That's so applicable to Foreign Concept. Foreign Concept is so hot right now. The food is truly unique. It's not what I think of when I think of Asian fusion (heavy, deep-fried, gluttinous) . The food here is refined, with clean, unique flavours."}
{"text":"This restaurant was underwhelming. Went on a double date as part of a work dinner. We had reservations. My guest wanted to check it out. 

The hostess greeted us and asked if we wanted to sit restaurant or lounge side. They said the lounge side would have dim sum service - so we went to the lounge. 

We ordered a quite a bit of food. The experience started poorly but got better. 
- I would not recommend the charcuterie board. The mix of Asian inspired meats and pickled vegetables wasn't desirable or tasty. 
- we then split albacore tuna poke and the beef tataki. The poke was flavourful and plentiful - delicious. The beef tataki was also executed very well, great taste and texture to the dish. Both recommended. 
- for mains, the charsiu pork and foie gras deconstructed steam Bun was excellent. If you go here - definitely try that. The Alberta Trout was just good - nothing super memorable. 
- We also tried all the desserts as well, which were good. There was a Vietnamese Coffee Parfait that was the most popular - thought personally I was happiest with the coconut and pineapple gelato .

The reason for two stars was really the service. I can't stand going to places where either a) they don't deliver on their promises or b) they basically \"forget\" about your table. 
- the dim sum service we were promised never came. No apologies, just a shoulder shrug from our server and an \"I guess it's not coming\". 
- very slow on water and sake replenishment.  I served the table the sake bottle I ordered (we did not get any recommendation on sake despite the staff saying they learning/ learned about sake).
- frequently had to hail down staff to ask for items.

Outside of the service, the wall decor is interesting but the furnishings and table settings/ chairs are plain and uninspired. 

I wouldn't go back, nor would I recommend to friends."}
{"text":"New to Calgary, I tried this restaurant after reading about it in an article that talked highly about it. A nice fusion restaurant, this one scores high on the ambience, theme and service. If you are a fan of charcuterie (branch of cooking devoted to prepared meat products), this one is for you. I am not into that. I tried the crispy lemon chicken and it was delicious. The large dish - free range chicken was okay. The dessert Vietnamese coffee parafit was terrific. If you are a vegan or a vegetarian, there aren't many options for you as most of the dishes use a fish broth. I am going to remember this place more for the ambience than the food."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. The menu looked very interesting but the food just wasn't that great - not that tasty and not necessarily cooked well, especially for the prices. The eggplant appetizer was tasty as well as the fisherman's stew (which came with lovely big prawns). The Chinese doughnut however was hard and tasteless. We also had the fried rice which came with very little meat and was pretty....meh, just ok. I was most disappointed in the crepes which contain octopus. I've had different octopus dishes at a few restaurants in Calgary and really loved it, but in this dish it was overcooked and the dish was rather bland. I thought for sure it would be a winner! So, it wasn't an awful experience but definitely not worth it for the price. With all the great restaurants here in Calgary to choose from I won't be returning."}
