{"text":"Great food, reasonably priced. Large portions, plentiful variety! I highly recommend the orange chicken, the Mongolian beef and the number five meal with chicken, vegetables and lo mein noodles.scrumptious!"}
{"text":"Food is good,  but the fried rice had a burnt taste to me,  My sister said it's good but It tasted funny to me.  But overall everything else we had was good"}
{"text":"My combination shrimp and vegetables with lomein was pretty good.  Large portions served on a Styrofoam plate which was brought to our table in less than 5 minutes piping hot. The restaurant is very clean which shows the owners care about their business.  The restrooms are also very clean.  Prices are reasonable and large tasty portions served from a broad selection of dishes.   Nice family run business across the street from Walmart."}
{"text":"Our family has been going to Yan's every since they opened and they have never disappointed us. The food always comes out hot and fresh, they have good customer service, the prices are good and the food tastes great!  This is always one of our favorite go to family restaurants."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Very decent food for a reasonable price. Not a flashy place but a wide variety on the menu that appears to specialize in American-Chinese style food. Tasty, big portions, and attentive staff made this a place we'll be coming back to again."}
{"text":"Kung Pow!!! Great quick Chinese food, I had the Kung pou and was very happy with the large chunks of chicken and fresh vegetables. Very fresh and good food, highly recommend for a quickie."}
{"text":"They give you large portions so I would suggest sharing. I'm not a big fan of Orange Chicken but theirs was actually pretty good. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Great place, our usual place for good chinese food in the west valley. Staff are courteous and friendly. We dine in and get take out several times per month and have never had any problems. Good portions and consistency."}
{"text":"Love this place. Come here for lunch when ever I'm in the area. Food is always fresh and portions are huge"}
{"text":"Dumbest place ever! Tried to order sweet and sour chicken with shrimp fried rice. I was told i couldn't replace the flavorless steamed rice for shrimp fried rice I'd have to order a separate 6 dollar order of fried rice. You've got to be joking. No way in hell. And then when i said well screw the meal give me an order of shrimp fried rice and a side of sweet and sour chicken she cant speak English so well...after trying to order for 15 mins ..needless to say i will not be going back...."}
{"text":"Awesome food!!  Great price too. I had the Orange chicken combination plate and my man had the beef broccoli combo plate. Soooo good and great customer service!!  It was served very hot and with some fanfare. Very reasonable at around 8 bucks. GREAT dinner and very fast!! We would be regulars if we lived here."}
{"text":"Horrendous!   I ordered the Pad Thai Chicken. The overall color of the dish was orange. It was less than 1% vegetables with the occasional shred of carrot or onion). It also featured lovely aftertastes from multiple different dishes. There was an unmistakable shrimpy taste as well as a slight orangeyness that appeared in every bite. Every once in a while a spicy bit would rear its head as well, but those were few and far between. The amalgam of flavors on the dish resulted in a sticky, gooey, and pungent buildup of gunk slathered on to each and every noodle. I tried to give it a chance, but i stopped once my stomach started to echo my taste bud's complaints.   My companion fared slightly better. He ordered the kung-pao chicken entree. His was more tolerable but overall flavorless. Not a spice in sight and extremely bland.   I'm not sure if we came in on a bad night or what. The pictures featured here look absolutely lovely. Unfortunately what ended up in our take out boxes was only fitting for the trash can. Not even a drunk college guy could stomach their food. He immediately regretted his attempt to fill his gut with such crap."}
{"text":"Fresh food & Super tasty! And the staff and the owner are really nice and helpful. Definitely recommend everyone give this place a try."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place gets close to a five star rating.  I went there tonight because of the rating on Yelp, and I must say, it is one step above Panda Express.  As a Chinese restaurant, I expected to be able to order Lo Mein.  Nope, don't have that.  How about hot tea?  Nope, no hot tea.  The fortune cookie comes with your meal because, guess what, you paid for your meal before you received it, so the transaction is over, here's your fortune cookie.  The take-away lesson here is:  don't rely on the star rating alone; read the reviews.  The food here was incredibly average and not incredibly cheap.  I probably will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is really good, I like their house Fried rice and its big portion size.  Oh they have the most awesome fried dumpling, my mouth is drooling just thinking about it. I normally order there at least 2 to 3 time a month sometime to go or eat in."}
{"text":"Yan's food has always been extra fresh and amazing. My go to place for Chinese food in Goodyear. Try house egg fuyung. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food, Great price and Great ambiance:  Being my first visit here, Yan's is a great Chinese restaurant and a family favorite for take out.   The service is friendly and the food is WOW..exceptional.  They use all white meat chicken all though the orange chicken was okay, but not the best. It had a flavorless taste.  My favorite dish was there Chow Mein and Mongolian Beef and i highly recommend that next time you visit.  If you like good traditional chinese food with a large selection, this is the place to go.  Since it was my first time here, I will be trying out other dishes the next time im there which will be really soon.  While you are there be sure to grab a take out menu for future visits."}
{"text":"Thought we try this place out cuz we were hungry and it was next to where we were. It was a disappointment...ordered the salt and pepper pork chops and it was not good. Looked nothing like the picture. Meat was dry and hard, and too salty. On top of that it was kinda pricey. Not again"}
{"text":"So far the better tasting of all the Chinese restaurants around here.  I can get 3 meals out of 1 main dish."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with my boyfriend for the first time . All the workers were very welcoming. they serve very large portions, but if you have an appetite like my boyfriend you have no problem finishing the whole thing.  Veggie rolls are extremely good ! I will definitely go back again ."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! The food is always fresh and has great flavor.. and the service is exceptional! The guy at the register was even kind enough to carry my food to my car out for me!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty horrible. The food is so greasy they have to wrap the to-go box in a BAG to keep it from leaking all over the place. I love rib-sticking terrible food, but when the grease runneth over, that's just too much. When I do eat here, I ask them to go easy on the cooking oil which definitely helps the leakage situation they have going on over there. Or I just take the safe route and get fried rice.   I don't want to be all negative so I will say the portion sizes are good, the staff is friendly and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"I'm recovering from surgery and limited to liquid diet/soft food. I ordered the wonton soup, didn't eat anything from it but sipped the juice and it tasted good. I'm scared of trying new foods. Haha! Most of the other meals look tasty. I'll come back and try again. It looks better than panda."}
{"text":"This is gotta be one of the worst Chinese places I have ever tried. The food was disgusting to the point it was not edible. It was so deep fired that you can no longer see or taste the meat. I had the orange chicken (it was horrible) and my husband ordered the shrimp. In both cases, all you tasted was the breading. The lady at the counter was rude and not attentive at all. Do not waste your money and eat here."}
{"text":"Great food , clean , friendly & fast service ! 100%   I got the orange chicken combo with fried rice & a spring roll . I also got an order of the pad thai rice noodles those were great as well. And lastly an order of chicken chow mein yumm  I highly recommend this food portions are perfect."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place many times and decided yesterday to stop by and give it a try. When I try a new Oriental restaurant - I judge it based on the same three things - their House Lo-Mein or House Chow-Main, their Egg Rolls and/or Spring Rolls and their Chicken Wings. I also eat in, which if you truly want to judge a location eat in first, don't run home with your food.  WHAT I DID NOT LIKE:  Cleanliness - I was there at 5:20pm, none of the tables had been wiped down. The person who sits there (if lucky) throws away their trays, etc. when they are done. But it was obvious no one comes along and periodically cleans the tables.  Chicken Wings - not sure why the Orientals cannot make a decent chicken wing, but this place wins the prize for being the most nasty wings I have ever had. If you love grease and no taste you will probably give these 5 stars.  Chicken Egg Rolls / Vegi Spring Rolls - frozen and fried, mush inside (had both), though the Spring Rolls had a slight better taste than the Egg Rolls, I would not order either ever again. Grease and mush in a crispy shell is best how describe both.  WHAT I DID LIKE:   PORTION - I will agree with everyone here, the portions are huge and I was not disappointed there for the price. In a pinch I would go back and order a main course, just nothing else. Also don't get hung up on \"Lo-Mein\" vs \"Chow-Mein\" unless you have a clue what both really mean. Both can come as a soft noodle.  PRICE - Good  (Main Dish) TASTE - I enjoyed the flavor of the House Chow-Mein and while not the best I have had in town, it was really good and I would have it again.  So three stars - for price, main dish taste and portions. Stop there with your order and it probably will not disappoint.   For the person who said that this is the best place in the West Valley, please get out more, this is obviously the only place you have been. For those that compare authentic Oriental Restaurants to Panda Express, please get cultured - don't disgrace the Orientals that way."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the place was clean and the waitress was friendly.  I had a craving for fried rice so I ordered BBQ Pork Fried Rice, with a small order of Beef & Broccoli. The food wasn't good at all. Both the beef and pork had a weird texture and flavor to it. I picked out the pork and tried eating just the rice, which it tasted burnt, even when I put Sriracha. So I just trashed them both.   The portions were really big, but they were definitely not worth the price. In this case the saying quality over quantity does not apply. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Had the Mongolian Beef & the Cashew Nut Chicken...both were excellent! Will be back again."}
{"text":"Still on my never ending quest for good chinese food in az I walked in this place.  It smelled good so I thought why not. The lady who took my order wasn't the friendliest but customer service is dead so ok.  I ordered pork fried rice, chicken egg foo young, and orange chicken. I am not pleased.  I don'tknow how they did it, the rice tasted burnt.  The egg fooo young had big chunks of vegetables, too big, and was flavorless. I will say the orange chicken was meh ok at best. Needless to say I will not be back. Not good."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Chinese spot here in Phoenix!!! I travel back and forth between the Phoenix area and Northern CA and have been looking for a good Chinese restaurant here in Phoenix and have finally found it!!! The food was wonderfully DELICIOUS and fairly inexpensive with the majority of entrées priced at less than $10 dollars each. We ordered the sweet-n-sour chicken/pork, house fried rice, and shrimp w/ broccoli. There was plenty of meat in the rice including shrimp. There was plenty of shrimp in the broccoli and we were even able to get $2. of beef added to the shrimp w/ broccoli which was also good amount of meat to make our own combo dish. The service was fast as others have reported. The dining space was very limited and not very inviting but the food for me is the best that I've had here in the Phoenix area and is the place to beat for me. At this point I'm willing to make the 20+ minute drive from our place any and every time that I want Chinese food while in Phoenix.  My only con was the lack of ambiance and limited appetizer menu.  Thanks to all those who have posted your opinions to Yelp as the reviews for this place were the driving factor for us trying it out. The rave reviews are much warranted!!"}
{"text":"Called in my order at 5:45p on a Thursday night. The woman who answered was very efficient. After I ordered, she gave me my total and asked when I would like to pick up the food. I told her 15 minutes, which was fine by her.  I drove over to pick it up and was able to park right in front. When I walked in and there were two women behind the counter helping a couple of customers.  While waiting, I noticed I could see right into the kitchen, which always reassures me a little bit. The place was mostly empty, though there were several tables. Seemed small, but fairly clean.   My food was all ready and the woman helping me was kind enough to split my transaction (part cash, part on my card). Then I was on my way. When I got home, the food was still piping hot (so I know it wasn't sitting on the counter for too long before I got there).  I was thinking of ordering some of their more interesting sounding menu items, but my sister decided we should try their basic dishes to 'get a feel for the place.' I ordered chicken egg rolls, sweet and sour chicken, beef and broccoli, and vegetable chow mein. Total came to like $28. Totally do-able.  We liked everything but the chow mein, which was rather bland. Maybe if we had added chicken or something it would have been more flavorful. The chicken was all white meat, and the beef was not super fatty (which you see sometimes in cheap Chinese food).  Pretty decent and crazy close to my house. We will be returning again."}
{"text":"We discovered Yans last month and have returned every weekend since. Excellent food, large portions and very affordable."}
{"text":"So, long time customer, but I have to say no more.  Between the mistakes on my take out, bad customer service, and extremely long waits on called in orders for take out, I am left to dine elsewhere.  Food quality has always been good and pricing fair."}
{"text":"It is a good eat. They use all white meat chicken and give you plenty to eat. My wife always gets sweet and sour chicken. It is enough to feed to boys from one plate. They all love it.   The orange chicken is is just too sweet for me. If it wasnt so syrupy and had more spice, it would be better. I like white meat chicken with some spice. Good, but just too sweet.  Mongolian beef is very tasty. Thats usually what I get. Again, not quite the kick I like. I usually add some sriracha hot sauce. Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here and stopped in person for take-out, but as hard as it is to get good chinese food in Phoenix that doesn't make you feel sick afterwards, I really hope this place succeeds because the food is incredible. Incredible!"}
{"text":"I went in around  lunch time.had a wonton soup.all fresh vaggies were used.shrimp and very tender wontons.it was good.i also had a teriyaki chicken bowl with steamed rice.also very good,chicken was thin sliced and smothered in a rich and tasty teriyaki sauce .it had toasted sesame seeds sprinkled on top.very good.not overpriced. Good Chinese food.fresh ingredients..."}
{"text":"This restaurant and location never let's me down, the food was tasty and the portion size generous. I strongly recommend this location for a good meal."}
{"text":"We ate here last night! Great food, phenomenal customer service! The sweet woman begind the counter had her son help me carry the food to my car because I was holding my baby! Totally will be going back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and never disappoints. The flavor of their food is amazing.  Food is fresh and fast. Plus you get a ton of food for the money."}
{"text":"Been here twice already. The young man that takes the orders and gets them ready for pickup is so nice and pleasant. The food is awesome it's still hot when I get home. Taste even better as leftovers. Would highly recommend AWESOME PLACE  Thanks for the great food and service"}
{"text":"paid $9 for plates that barely fed 1 person . The food was horrible and cold . I was thinking chinese but maybe it was something else. didn't know the combo rice was curry spicy. didn't know Chinese did curry... The Asian bistro down the street  way better...It was takeout so I couldn't say anything until I got home."}
{"text":"Food bland need more flavor. Order at counter. Served on paper plate was here at lunch time and only three people. It's ok but not the best."}
{"text":"Great service! Amazing food! Vegetable chow mein and orange chicken! YUM!"}
{"text":"This local restuarant is thus far the best Chinese food I have tasted in the Pheonix area. The food is fresh and with quick service."}
{"text":"Of of all the Chinese places I've gone to so far around here, this one takes the cake! I could not, for the life of me, find a place that makes affordable Chicken Pad Thai but Yan's makes deliciously right and still keeps it affordable. I go here very other Sunday it's sort of a tradition now. I just love it so much! Yan's gets the highest of fives from me :)"}
{"text":"These guys have consistently provided excellent food at an amazing price. I drive all the way from Power and the 60 to get their food.   The best in Arizona, hands down!"}
{"text":"Very good food, quick and nice service, great variety. Would definitely recommend for chinese food lovers. Clean tables and chairs and overall cleanliness!"}
{"text":"I recently ate there with my family. I had chow fun, my daughter had chicken chow mein, husband got the sweet & sour chicken. i personally thought the food was horrible and it gave us belly aches!"}
{"text":"Always quality food with great flavor. Service is efficient and pleasant volcano beef and orange chicken are super yummy. We love Yans!!"}
{"text":"Food is better than service......cashier acts as if she's doing me a favor,even though she was nicely rude....this is sad because Goodyear could use more GOOD mom & pop businesses."}
{"text":"One of our favorite oriental cuisines in goodyear. The crab rangoons are to die for. My wife likes the Mongolian beef, I prefer the noodles and appetizers."}
{"text":"This place gets a 3-star \"A-OK\" rating because for a fast food Chinese place, it's \"A-OK.\"   It's better than Panda Express, not as good as Pei Wei, and the food is about even with other family-style, strip-mall resident Chinese restaurants.   The decor is like a pizza joint. They must have recently gotten some new chairs and tables, which were nice; although, the chairs had plastic on the seats still.   My husband had picked up take-out a couple of months ago, and the food was fairly good, so we tried it again in a pinch. This time we ate there.   Our host/server had this ridiculously dry sense of humor, and my husband was his best audience member. Michael would pitch him a doozy, and this guy would knock it out of the park.   We had the twice cooked chicken and the kung pao beef. Both were good - I'd definitely get those dishes again and recommend them!"}
{"text":"love this place we comes from los angeles....where 99cent chinese food is the norm. of course there is pf changs and than there authentic! the hostess is a hoot! he is so funny. think vanilla ice by the voice...& peter griffin by the body from family guy! lmao...ok ok back to the food.,.. scrumptious. i mean rice is fluffy and lite. the beef and broccoli oh man! cheap price. next up tangs that just opened."}
{"text":"Sad to say I couldn't experience this place it says it delivers but when I called to my disappointment the person said that they don't deliver and hanged up  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME IN CALLING FOR DELIVERY!!!!"}
{"text":"I would have to say the portion was bigger than what you get a panda but I'm still conflicted with my overall impression. Over floured chicken is a sin in my eyes, whether it's fried hard and crunch or has obvious air pockets from where the flour didn't have a chance to completely stick. It wasn't horrible but will not be my first choice for local chinese."}
{"text":"Good portions, good prices. Friendly staff. I'll be back! Great place to have a cheap, filling lunch."}
{"text":"I love yans. It's very mom and pop, always tastes delicious and every time I go, they're so sweet to me! Everything me and my family have tried is great, in fact my dad orders from there so much, they know his phone number and name haha. I would come here all the time in high school and since I moved away after I graduated, it's nice to stop in for some mongolian beef every time I can!"}
{"text":"Got the shrimp friend rice to go.  It was OK.  Big pieces of shrimp so that was a plus.  I wish they had yan chow fried fried but they don't.  Disappointing but the fried rice I did get is about par with most places in the area."}
{"text":"Wow, I just signed up for Yelp after checking reviews occasionally over the years. I had to register now just to put my 2 cents in on Yan's though, among others.   I was quite surprised by a few harsh reviews on Yelp for Yan's and I really disagree with nearly all of the negativity.  The host guy at the front counter is a wanna-be comedian, but it's all in good fun. A restaurant should be reviewed and judged by it's food first though, and this is probably the best Asian restaurant West of 101 and certainly the best in Goodyear and Avondale that we've had.   I've eaten at hundreds of Asian restaurants all around the country and was pleasantly surpised when Yan's opened. They have a respectable hot and sour soup, excellent sized portions and the food is all freshly cooked to order. The Mongolian Beef has better quality meat than most and is very good. They even had Asians doing the cooking, can't find that at PeiWei or Panda, etc. these days.  Do yourself a favor, try this place for yourself. If you don't like the relatively simple, but clean, decor then take it home to eat."}
{"text":"The only reason you can call this place a Chinese restaurant is because there are Chinese looking people behind the counter. The food is some of the worst tasting unhealthy fare around. If you order the Orange chicken for example, you will find that about 50% of yor chicken serving is batter!...this soaks up a lot of oil and thus, fat!..The bright side? It's across a hospital.  i say this coz that's where you'll end up if you keep eating here."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Food okay, but with the rude lady, it made it taste worse than it probably was. I haven't been back in over a year because the last time there I was charged for water. Really?? In Az it is not legal to not provide water. I asked the lady and she said she charged for the cup and lid. Really? I tried to explain in English to her why they could not charge for water and she argued with me. I told her that was okay, she lost a few customers over $.25. There are a billion great Asian places to eat that now have my business and my family's business.  I know petty for me over such a small amount, but it's the principal and her attitude."}
{"text":"I love this place I get the same everytime Curry shrimp with extra Curry sauce and Chicken Fried Rice. Quick service, clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Normally I only go for the sesame chicken when I have Chinese food.  While this wasn't the worst food I have ever had it was far from the best.  The coating on the chicken was very spongy and the flavor was so-so.  The good thing was you could at least identify the chicken as white meat.  Would probably not go back.  Still waiting to find sesame chicken in goodyear that's any good."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and looking for a good Chinese place.  Read the reviews and decided to give this place a try.  Needless to say the five stars leaves a lot to be desired.  We got the orange chicken and the Hawaiian rice.  The orange chicken was soggy and not much flavor.  The rice also had no flavor.  Not a fan of Panda Express, but at least you know not to expect great food.  Here this place gets five stars and it turns out to be an insult to your taste buds, I want my money back."}
{"text":"Visiting at the hospital across the street and decided to order some take out. The pork fried rice was very tasty, the beef and broccoli was very fresh and good, as was the combo chow mein. Service was very fast."}
{"text":"Originally from Ohio, and we had some great Chinese restaurants all over. Dont know why, exactly... not typically a place where you'd settle from another country. When we moved here, we figured the same would be true here. But in the west valley, there seemed to be a shortage. I decided to try this new little place by dunkin donuts after pregnancy cravings subject me to good flied lice. Wow. We have been so impressed by everything: the service, the food and the amount you get for the money, the quickness in preparation, the cleanliness. Just fyi, we wanted to make sweet and sour chicken into a combo which isnt offered on the menu. When we called the goodyear location, they wouldnt do it, but this location on west thomas did.  So make no mistake about it,good chinese food in the west valley!"}
{"text":"So, I decided to get sum china food today!!! Umm i got spicy orange chicken n fried rice...... I'm not very happy with the chicken I thought it was going to be crunchy with sum spicy sauce but it's not.... In that case I should of went to Panda Express for realz!!!! Not as great as everyone in here says it is!!!! I don't like the taste,"}
{"text":"Good Chinese food. A little further from my home than others but I come here when I want to change it up a little. Mongolian beef is really good. Consistent food each time we've ordered. We'd come more often if it was closer, but it's worth the drive every now and then."}
{"text":"Yummy, fast, fairly priced, and great service! I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing the food is phenomenal the price is reasonable and I would definitely recommend yans to anyone"}
{"text":"If you like ROCKS in your food eat here!   On March 30th we ordered 8 dinners for the 9 people in the family - 8 adults and 1 child.  2 orders of Twice Cooked Beef.  I had some and had 3 weirdly crunchy bites.  Whatever it was was so small I could not find them and just let it go.    My daughter and I were talking to my son while he was eating his Twice Cooked Beef.  We heard a screeching noise and then a crack!  My son looked horrified and ran to the bathroom.  He came back having found a quartz type rock about the size of a pea in the food.  He was in pain. The rock ended up breaking off part of a filling he had and bruising both the top and bottom teeth. About 4 weeks out he is still having some sensitivity issues with pressure, hot and cold.    He and my husband went over to Yan's and talked to the owners or manager he gave them Yan's insurance info.  The dentist did what he could and will watch the teeth for awhile to make sure their is no lasting damage.  The staff and dentist asked; so you at least got some free Chinese food out of all this and we had to say, No!    As of today, I talked to Danny Chin, the manager, and gave him the chance to comp us some food so we could be assured that their are not rocks in all their food.  He said no, they would not do that.  I feel like they are saying \"Hey, rocks happen.\"  \"Rocks in food, eh, that is normal.\"  For your troubles we will pay for the dentist that we caused you to have to go to and the pain and suffering well screw you.    At this point I am thinking \"Lawyer\".  If you are a lawyer who would enjoy taking this case.  Let me know, we are open to it."}
{"text":"I have tried four dishes here and they were all very good.  I work in this area and just realized Yan's was close by.  We have a Yan's close to my house, but this one seems to have better food.  Friendly service, an A from the health dept (posted on the door) and good food!  I have tried several chinese food places in the Maryvale area and have been disappointed by all but Yan's."}
{"text":"Great little Chinese place. Staff is great and so is the food. The prices are comparable to panda express, but your getting a much better quality of food. You can see them chopping vegetables in the kitchen, which is always a good sign. I ordered, went to the bathroom, and when i came out the food was ready. This place is pretty legit, its a nice find"}
{"text":"This is some of the best tasting Chinese food I have had in a long time.  It was very hot when served.  I had the Kung Pao Tofu.  I could have fed three people with what they gave me.  The price after tax was only $8.09; a deal at that price.     The down side to this eating establishment is that, while very clean, it was in need of repair and remodeling.  Their were many cracked tiles on the floor and their tables and chairs were showing signs of over use.     The only other complaint is that the fountain was Pepsi products instead of Coke products.        A solid **** stars"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for about 4-5 years with both my family and my boyfriend and its the best in the west! Lol I adore their chicken chow fun (spicy) as well as just about everything else. I'm picky when it comes to my Chinese food but this place is great, prices and all!!"}
{"text":"This is the typical Chinese food take out spot. They have all the goodies and will make you feel like you just ate Chinese food. Place is easily accessible and doesn't seem busy. You can peek into the kitchen while ordering at the counter and while at first glance it may look normal, my previous experience as a fire marshal looking at kitchens tells me this place is unsafe and a little dirty. When I think of this place I think about dropping that M&M and picking it up right away to eat it because we all know germs give us that 5 second grace period before they attack our food. This is an emergency pit stop establishment and I feel for the nearby hospital workers or nearby residents that have this as their only delivery option. Surely the location is prime so there has to be another Chinese take out spot nearby. The big positive: I didn't get sick."}
{"text":"It slipped again. This time for the last time for us. Gus promises we will never go back even if he is being lazy and does not want to drive a little more down the road. This is the closest Chinese to our home, but hey we might move anyway.  This time around was very odd, four tables with no chairs and none to be found. So While Gus was ordering I asked for a cloth to clean a dirty table with chairs. She suggested I move the chairs to one of the empty tables. I said do not want to sit at one of those tables, I prefer one in a corner where no one can pass behind me. So she went over and washed off the table for us, with a smile I might ad. Look these are really nice folks running this place and I wish I liked it. But God the food is just horrible. Gus ordered a beef dish that looked and tasted like it was drenched in a molasses sauce. Mine was spicy but no flavour and the rice was just yucky, how do you screw up white rice."}
{"text":"Nothing about this place says to me, \"Wow, I feel like I'm in Panda Express!\" It's a mom and pop joint tucked in a small business strip. Once inside, the walls are adorn with pictures of many of their entrees.    You get a lot of food for the money AND the dishes taste better than any place I've been to in the area. Now this is not an establishment that you would take your first date to. They serve their population, which is the employees and clients or the nearby hospital and other local businesses."}
{"text":"Always pleasantly surprised by how yummy this place is. Very fresh food. The sauces aren't all sticky and sugary- usually quite flavorful. House fried rice is amazing! Fast, clean and friendly. We usually get it to go even though it does have a dine-in area it isn't really that inviting to stay and eat in. Generous portions- good prices."}
{"text":"The restaurant smells off when you walk in and my chicken teriyaki felt squishy."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food love their house fried rice. Orange chicken is always good. They serve you fast and it's super fresh they start cooking when you order it."}
{"text":"Food was horrible!   I had the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl & it literally was rice, chicken, & sauce.  Who has a chicken bowl with no vegetables.   The chicken & sauce were completely bland.  Will never be back"}
{"text":"Excellent Food! Not your typical mall food court chinese food. Made fresh and honestly have never had better! The interior could use a more comfy feel but worth it :)"}
{"text":"Yan's is good! Low prices, large quantities and consistently good food. Service is also really quick, whether dining in or taking out. In terms of food, I stick with something un-fried and something that has veggies, since the orange, honey and sesame chicken all kind of taste similar.   Also, if you order an egg roll, make sure to ask for sweet and sour sauce or you might not get any. In the realm of Chinese food, there are few things I hate more than having to eat a dry egg roll :("}
{"text":"Just watched the chef drop his tongs on the ground, pick them up and use them again. Refund? Yes please.  Not returning to this place. When I asked him about it he wouldn't respond to me."}
{"text":"I've ordered lots of chinese delivery since being in AZ. and this is place was actually surprisingly better than most.  I'm always hesitant when ordering from a new Asian restaurant from so many bad experiences here.  The lady on the phone was typical of any other Asian restaurant and very friendly.  Ordered orange beef, sweet and sour chicken and the shrimp vegetable,  all were really good surprisingly.  The orange beef is probably the best I've had from a delivery, could use a lil more spiciness.   Prices were better than most places as well.  Would order again."}
{"text":"Large portions and cooked to order! Good sweet and sour chicken! Can't wait to come back and try more. The young gentleman was very helpful that was up front. My nephew got the orange chicken and said it was good but wasn't really that spicy!"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite Chinese food restaurant. Everything I've had here is so good. Definitely recommend any beef dish and the chicken lol mein is delicious too."}
{"text":"First time ordering tonight. I got the orange chicken with chow me in combo. Roommate got the Mongolian beef combo. Both were delicious. Crab ragoons were full of cream cheese and worth the money. Ordered a small egg drop soup and it was honestly the best egg drop soup. Full of flavor and no tofu. Wait was a little longer for delivery but so worth it. Will be returning."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, waiting for someone and stopped in for a bite. Great food and pretty quick. Good spot."}
{"text":"This food is average at best.  My husband thought it was ok, my mother hated it and I couldn't order anything because they have never heard of gluten free.  When I asked if they could just leave the soy sauce off they seemed confused.  We wont be going back."}
{"text":"This place is awful. They treat human beings with disrespect. Also the food is awful. I have had better Chinese food from the frozen food isle at Fry's. Orange chicken tastes like 5 day old chicken nuggets from McDonald's with a bit of Great Value orange jello smeared across them."}
{"text":"The food here is exceptional! It does not  matter what I order it is always fresh and hits the spot.  I always have my food delivered and it arrives hot and ready to eat !!!! Friendly delivery staff ;-)"}
{"text":"I always get vegetable chop Suey the best very fresh! I've tried other Chinese restaurants this place has sweet-and-sour shrimp very good too."}
{"text":"This place has good Chinese food, and is always cooked to order.  Prices are decent, but can get expensive if you are like me and would like to have different dishes for a meal.  I guess you can have left overs! Yan's is one of the best Chinese food places in Goodyear, maybe even the West Valley."}
{"text":"Another cheap Chinese food restaurant. Ordered the Teriyaki Chicken, doesn't come with anything but rice and chicken. Had to ask for vegetables which costed extra. My chicken was literally swimming in sauce with hardly any veggies and they forgot to give me my rice which is a huge part of the entree. There sauce wasn't very good either. I'm sorry but they get 1 Star from me."}
{"text":"Food was ok. I had better. I asked for Chinese fried chicken and no one knew what I was talking about. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"5 stars for the simple fact that its great, authentic, cheap Chinese food. I love the orange chicken. Spring rolls are tasty. Great prices for big portions."}
{"text":"Now look, if you only like high end expensive Chinese food, this may not be the place for you. However, if you like late night, wonderfully terrible Chinese food this is your place! I loved the food! I like all kinds of Chinese food and mean no disrespect to this establishment at all. The customer service was fantastic! I called in to order and only waited a few minutes once I arrived to pick it up. I had the pot stickers, pan fried, the orange chicken, and BBQ pork lo mien. Everything was very good, fresh and flavorful. You could see, what looked to be a family in the back cooking the food. The place was clean and a single tv on the wall playing college football. The portions were great. I'm having leftovers this morning as Chinese is my favorite breakfast! Pay no attention to the other reviews about portion or greasy food, as I found neither to be true."}
{"text":"I was SHOCKED at the lack of human kindness by these people!  My mom & I went in this place today, Sept 20th, for lunch.  While we were eating, a obviously homeless man came in a had the money to purchase a LARGE soda, he filled his cup and just sat down and the Chinese man came out from the back and waved him to get out.  I stood up at that time and asked the man if I could buy him lunch, he looked tired, hot & hungry.  I purchased him a lunch and and my mother & I continued to eat our lunch.  They proceeded to make his meal in a TO GO BOX & BAG and hold the door open for him and tell him to \"get out\".  I stood up and questioned why they made him leave and they said \"he stink\".  I stood next to him when I asked him what he wanted to eat and 3 other older ladies came in and said he didn't stink!!  What happened to kindness to others and I've always been taught if you go to a fast food place and make ANY purchase, you can sit down in their establishment to drink or eat it.  We will NEVER go back or recommend them to ANYONE!!"}
{"text":"Was expecting better  We were looking for a quick bite to eat and decided to stop in at Yan's . The staff at Yan's were friendly and it seemed to be a very popular spot.  On this visit we ordered the lunch special, Mongolian Chicken, egg drop soup, fried wonton, and eggroll, we were a little disappointed with our entrée's. The seasoning level was okay, however,  the chicken was overcooked and there was just to much onion. Next we tried the Eggrolls and Fried Won Tons, once again those items were just okay. Our meals just okay, maybe I was expecting something more.   I love Chinese food however, Yan's wouldn't be one of my first choices. But since there is a big selection on the menu, maybe the other entrée's  are better tasting."}
{"text":"I love their food!!i always get their orange chicken, beef and broccolli, white rice, house combo fried rice with chilli oil and its mm mm GOOD! only thing i have to say is that they seemed bothered to sell me more than 2 chilli oils... i would EASILY pay 1 dollar for each little container if i was asked but please dont give me an ugly look when i ask for 5 haha. The place is always clean, the food is always FRESH. I LOVE it."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but every time I have gone, the employees have been pretty rude. IMO, there's other chinese restaurants close-by with better food and better customer service at around the same price."}
{"text":"This place is great! I love the food and portions. It's way better than Panda Express."}
{"text":"Ordered the mongolian beef and the beef was some of the lowest quality meat I have ever had.  Maybe I was eating dog or cat.  Not sure but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I are new to the Phoenix area and have been in search of a yummy Chinese food restaurant. Well, our search is finally over. This place has very tasty and fresh Chinese food. My fiancé loves the BBQ pork appetizer and orange chicken and I'm very fond of the beef and broccoli. We usually order delivery and the food is always delivered fast and hot. I can't wait to try more items from the menu."}
{"text":"Some of the best fast food Chinese food I have had in a long time. The Resturant was very clean and had a nice look to it. I had the Mongolian Beef is was very tasty and it was a good value as well. The people working were very polite."}
{"text":"I love the food here, it is always good, fresh and plentiful.  The restaurant and kitchen are always clean and the atmosphere is calm and welcoming.  The staff is always friendly too."}
{"text":"I gave Yan's a second try after my first visit a few years back and... I'm still a little underwhelmed. This time I tried the sesame chicken and it was just okay. Some pieces were pretty fatty, although the sauce wasn't bad at all. The fried rice here seems to be missing a few ingredients, namely the vegetables you usually find in it (or is that an American thing?) Either way, not much flavor. The inside could use a makeover too.  I really doubt I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food is okay but it is very greasy.  It is hard to place a phone order because the person on the phone never understands English.  Don't order a side of hot mustard or extra packets of that pre-packaged hot mustard...they never get that.  I'm grateful that they now take on-line orders when I'm in desperate need of Chinese food.  It's the only time I order here now, always a last resort."}
{"text":"Wow, I am so glad I decided to try this place. Inside, the restaurant is spotless and nicely decorated. Very nice. I got takeout, and the food was amazing. As a vegan, it's tough to find tofu dishes anywhere in the West Valley. I highly recommend the kung pao tofu dish with a side of vegetable noodles.  My boyfriend tried my food and he was very impressed as well. Very fresh food, and delicious. Will definitely be back for more! :)"}
{"text":"The food is really good, but the reason for 3 stars is because I always have a headache after eating their food. Sodium? MSG? Not sure. The hubby is fine with it, I guess I'm too sensitive to that stuff. It's still really good though. Super fast service."}
{"text":"This place was a big disappointment.  The only thing it has going for it is that the servings were pretty large.  Otherwise, I think Panda Express is better, except for perhaps their chow mein."}
{"text":"I just can't decide what to get most of the time. The broccoli beef, house fried rice, twice cooked beef, pork fried rice, or Egg Drop Soup. Most plates are under 13$ and big servings."}
{"text":"Went here last night ordered the kung pao chicken and a small egg drop soup, I couldn't enjoy the chicken dish because it had an entire bunch of scallions (onions) my egg drop soup may as well been a bowl of water with egg and over cooked veggies it was bland to say the least. I will never go back, $12 wasted."}
{"text":"Food wasn't very good. Won't be coming here ever again. Pad Thai pasta were stuck together and it was just a gooey mix of a mess. The reason they got a star is for the dumplings. That was the only decent thing."}
{"text":"I placed my order and observed the cook put down his phone and began to prepare my meal WITHOUT washing his hands and WITHOUT putting on gloves. The woman who took my order and received my payment at the register went into the kitchen, she DID NOT wash her hands DID NOT PUT ON GLOVES and proceeded to use her bare hands pat down the chicken to make it fit into the container. This same woman then scratched her head and continue to pour sweet and sour sauce into a container and place the spring roll with her bare hand into the container.  I informed the woman that I would like to speak to a manager, she demanded to know why and I stated my observations on their hygiene. The woman came up to me and put her hands in front of my face and asked me to smell them, that her hands are clean and that I paid with a card and not cash so her hands were clean. I asked for my money back and she refused, she said she was the manager and that the food was \"as is\" and if I did not want it then I could throw it away. I walked out of that establishment without the food or my money back. I will not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"First time trying Yan's, and the food was excellent. We had spicy orange chicken, curry beef, shrimp with snow peas, and shrimp with vegetables. The food was fresh, hot, and seasoned to perfection. The portions are good and the price is reasonable and the owner is friendly. We finally have great Chinese food in the West Valley!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a new place to eat and saw Yan's.  I have found a good Chinese cuisine restaurant should be able to make a good fried rice and hot and sour soup.  Those are my leading indicators of whether it is a real Chinese food or American fast food restaurant.    I ordered Kung Pao Chicken combo with fried rice and a spring roll, some hot and sour soup to eat and some house fried rice to go.    The fried rice on the combo plate wasn't.  It was some light orange colored steamed rice.  Not bad, but not fried rice.    The hot and sour soup was a bit bizarre.  It was nicely spicy, but contained uncooked sliced button mushrooms.  I've had hot and sour soup that tasted more like warm dish water.  This was much better than that, but still way off the mark.  The sour component was mostly missing.  If you like southwestern spicy mushroom soup with bamboo sprouts and tofu, you'll enjoy this version.    So, with two major strikes against them, the Kung Pao Chicken was great.  Flavorful, spicy but not hot enough to blow out the taste buds.  When I got home and tasted the to go House Fried Rice, it was wonderful.  Great fried rice has a smokey taste from the extreme high heat of the wok.  This was a home run.  So, on the first visit, I'll give them a two star review with bonus points for a polite and friendly staff and another bonus for properly prepared house fried rice.     The food was poor or great.  Worth another try.  Still looking for some decent hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"Group of three, we all loved it. Had it delivered and it was hot, fresh and very tasty. No complaints, definitely recommend the Kung pao and orange chicken. If you like spicy, be very specific or they hold back. The flavor was still really good though. Would go back anytime."}
{"text":"This is some of the best chinese food on the west side, that you will find around. Its affordable, flavorful, and everything is piping hot when it comes out. I've only ever done takeout here, but I've never waited for my food and they have always gotten my orders correct. Egg drop soup, with the wontons and spring rolls are my favorites for lunch- that being said, they have some healthy lunch options, with serving sizes for leftovers for dinner. Worth it.   It is a hole in the wall, which also happens to be the best kind of restaurant you can go to. Love this place"}
{"text":"This was a good find for us as we were passing through town.  My husband wanted some flavorful but quick food since we had our dog with us.  We had seen the sign for Panda Express and were headed towards it when I eyed Yan's.  We were  very happy that we stopped here.  We entered and were greeted kindly.  Of course we were the only customers at the time. There were a lot of choices on the menu.  They also have a menu on the wall with pictures, which will give you an idea what you are ordering.  We were very pleased with our Twice cooked beef, Shrimp Chow Suey, and Deep Fried (battered) Shrimp.  We ordered a side of white rice to eat with the Twice cooked beef.  The Twice cooked beef was my favorite!.  The employees were very friendly up until the time we walked out the door.  We wouldn't mind stopping by Yan's again to try some new dishes, but for sure I would order the Twice cooked beef again!  WE'LL BE BACK (In Arnold's voice :D)"}
{"text":"Tried the chicken Pad Thai and was forewarned would be really spicy from the waitress. Although the food is really tasty, Pad Thai was no where near as spicy as I'm  used to from other places that I've been to. It tasted like there was sweet and sour sauce instead of any spice. Portions are decent amount so you do get your money's worth. Not great, but good."}
{"text":"Got a teriyaki with rice bowl wasn't so good the chicken was really sweet and the rice was a bit hard."}
{"text":"I go here pretty often for the shrimp in lobster sauce.  You get lot of shrimp in the entree, and a lot of food overall.  Very reasonably priced, especially for the quality and amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Ive been here 3 times. It's decent prices for the portions and food is great! Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I don't understand all these terrible reviews. I absolutely love yans. My family and I eat here almost twice a week every week and we have yet to have a bad experience. The food is amazingly fresh and the service is always great. This place is family owned, and they will always greet you with a smile (:"}
{"text":"Bomb a$$ veggie fried rice and veggie egg rolls!  Fried rice was a huge serving size and loaded with tons of fresh veggies!  Broccoli, zucchini, sugar snap peas, carrots, peas, bok choy and so much more!  Egg rolls were perfectly crisp but light and not too heavy.    This was a very unexpected find and I'm so happy I ran into it!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Totally good experience, for non over seasoned and salty food. Great layout and good customer service. Obviously they have been making changes because the other reviews do not do proper justice. Worth the time for a quick cheap meal."}
{"text":"I'm back in town in AZ and Yan's is always a pit stop that I need to make. On this trip, I had the chicken lettuce wrap with the crab rangoon. I really enjoy the filling that they use for the lettuce wrap because they include water chestnuts. The chestnut adds a wonderful crunch to the meal. I also enjoy how the seasoning for the lettuce wrap is just right. It is never too salty or too dry. The portion size also leaves plenty of food for leftovers. Being a college student, I love having leftovers. It really is great in my opinion. I also really like how they add celery to their lettuce wraps. In my experience, celery is not always an ingredient. But, I love the flavor of celery. Personally, I really love eating cream cheese. So, the crab rangoons resonate well with my personal tastes. But, I highly highly recommend them if you enjoy cream cheese and fried foods! Really tasty!   Yan's is a nice place to eat with very nice cashiers. They tend to remember you if you're a regular. They really are very nice even if it is a little bit difficult to understand them. If you're looking for an inexpensive bite to eat on the fly, please try Yan's."}
{"text":"Eaten here 10 or so times.  Chicken is all white meat, service is efficient, food is good and prices are good. Really just a good little Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Found this place today and would definitely recommend. The people were nice , the service was fast, and the food was great. This is my new favorite Chinese food place"}
{"text":"This was some of the worst food EVER!!! The service was good however, I ordered the sesame chicken & shrimp fried rice. They brought out sesame chicken & plain fried rice. The sesame chicken tasted like bland chicken with maple syrup. When they brought out my shrimp fried rice it was a mushy. I will NEVER go there again and ended up giving the food away to a homeless lady."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have to leave Yan's a 2-star review. We used to go here all the time when we first moved down to Goodyear. It's close to home, and we had heard great things about it. Those turned out to be true--great, fast service, yummy food, nice employees, etc. However, the last 3 or 4 times ended up being not so great at all. At first, we just thought it was a fluke. Then, the 2nd time, coincidence? After that, we have decided that we will probably not go there again unfortunately :( Sad, because we used to love Yan's! We aren't sure what happened, but here are the negatives we've experienced lately:  We ALWAYS get the Crab Rangoons with our meals every time. (By the way, we always call in and order take-out rather than eating there since it's so close to home.) They are usually great with the sauce they come with, but the last 3-4 times have not been so great. One time, they forgot to give us the sauce, which we did not notice until we had started eating our food. They are difficult to eat without sauce ;) The next few times, we had sauce, but it was extremely runny and seemed watered down... literally. The taste was completely diluted and different, as if they had run out or something and wanted to re-use what they had left. Not good :( The fact that it happened more than once is concerning.  We always call in and order it as take-out, and they tell us 10-15 minutes (or something along those lines.) We always arrive at the expected time, or sometimes a little later, and walk in to pick it up. At first, they were a few minutes later than expected, but lately it seems like they don't even put the order in until we walk into the restaurant. When I say \"seems like,\" I mean we ask for our order, and they tell the cooks to make it right in front of us. Ok, so why did we call in and order over the phone if we could have just saved ourselves the phone call and just walked in to order? So we sit and wait for the ~15 minutes while they make our order. This is totally fine, because it is fresh and usually good food, but it takes twice the amount of estimated time (and again, why even bother calling in if they don't put the order in until you arrive??!) This has happened several times now, not just once or twice.  The same dishes we used to love at Yan's don't seem to be of the same quality they used to be. They aren't as flavourful, and the meat seems to be very \"fatty\" at times. It wasn't always like this... It just seems like corners are being cut to make an extra buck. I know that \"times are tough\" right now, as much as I hate to keep saying that, and that most businesses are struggling right now, but it's just sad to see it happen right in front of us. We used to love going here, but now we just don't feel like spending the money if we are not satisfied. Hopefully it changes back to being a great place, but until then I have to leave then a 2-star review."}
{"text":"Decent for Chinese food - Take out.  The owner, or who I believe is to be the owner, is very friendly.  Heading over to open the door for his customers coming inside.  Bringing menus over to the table and after you order, your food over to your table.    Not your average Chinese Take-out restaurant.  Leftovers reheated decently too.  :)"}
{"text":"We ordered it for delievery with http://www.youbuyandwefly.com.  It's resonably priced and very yummy.  We'll order again.  I can't comment on the actual location though because again we ordered delievery.  I had the hot and sour soup and it was delicous, we also ordered some sweet and sour pork, orange chicken, and chicken chow main it was all good!"}
{"text":"Went out yesterday and was not disappointed when I ended up here. Left full for a decent price. Two combination meals for $17 and had left overs. And their noodles are AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh Yan's, how I love this place!! We did an order for pick-up of quite a few different things...all were great.   The lettuce wraps are ridiculous, like as in ridiculously good. I like them more than PF Chang's. I wish more sauce was given since the huge amazing portion of chicken and fresh lettuce is so generous and did I say good?, lol. We also ordered crab won-tons that were huge and very well full of cream cheese and a bunch of crab and I believe scallions...super tasty. The vegetable spring rolls were also excellent.  Along with the apps we also got chicken with vegetables and sweet and sour pork....both were not only generous portions with perfectly cooked rice in the boxes on the side but they were great! Good amount of white meat and greatly cooked pork also. The veggies were crisp but not under cooked, perfectly cooked in fact. Super good.   Only problem I had was no chopsticks in our to-go bag, no forks or spoons for sauces and no napkins. Otherwise, check this place out, it is pretty dang good and 10 steps above Panda for sure, Peace out :)"}
{"text":"Great food.  If you're from the east coast, this is the closest you'll come. I had almost given up looking for decent chinese when I found Yan's"}
{"text":"I've got to say, I'm not sure why this is near a 5 star rating, but I'm definately in on 4 stars... for what it is.  I don't think you should expect to be blown away by the food here, now, I'm not from around the PHX area so I don't know how to compare locally, but let me tell you the best comparison on what this place is, is like a higher quality Panda Express.  I mean the place even gives you the Panda Express feel when you walk in, but the rest of the story is different.  The food is definately good, It's a pretty diverse offering of food at a great price.  So this is where I can kinda see 5 stars, is you are getting probably one of the best bang for the buck take out chinese that I've been to.  But that's what you are getting, there is no ambiance in the restaraunt - however the service is very good, fast and friendly.  I'd recommend this place, just don't expect that if you are a chinese food snob that you are going to have a complete sit down experience here, it's best for take home."}
{"text":"I still continue to frequent Yans. I love the Crab Puffs and Egg rolls. Great food!"}
{"text":"Holy mother. Eat here. I live so freaking far away and that is sucky because this place blows every chinese food place in Scottsdale out of the water. Great chinese food, not greasy, you don't feel gross after eating here, and the staff is super friendly. I will have to stop by whenever I wander over to this area of town again"}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of my favorite chinese food places to go to! The inside is very clean and the staff is really nice and professional. A little bit pricey but definitely better than Panda express, so I think it's worth the extra dollar or two. They have a ton of food options, and I have tried quite a few of them. I love them all so far! The only problem may be that their spicy dishes aren't THAT spicy unless you ask them to make it extra spicy. Nonetheless, the food is very flavorful and high quality. I recommend that every one gives this restaurant a try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here last night and the food is fresh and amazing! I've not had Chinese food this good in a very long time. My husband isn't really into Chinese food and I can call him a skeptic but he wanted me to tell all you yelpers that this place has the best Chinese food he's ever had. (and mind you he's really picky) We will definitely come back to this place and the service is awesome!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the West Valley. Very friendly and great price for the portions. Highly recommend you go here and support a local business instead of a chain restaurant like Panda Express. Authentic Chinese cooked by Chinese staff."}
{"text":"I don't have particularly high standards for Chinese take out, but Yan's is noticeably a cut above pretty much everywhere else in the area. I went with my go-to dish, sesame chicken, and something about it tasted just so...REAL. Yeah, that's the best word. Like the chicken was bought fresh from a local store and not frozen forever. And the sauce is was lightly coated in tasted like actual honey...not a bunch of cheap sugar.   Their vegetable medley is also quite tasty. Portions are realistic for one person to consume, and not for 2-3 people like their cheaper competition. I plan on coming back. Often."}
{"text":"This place has quickly become our favorite local chinese joint.  The food is quick and cheap.  Much better than most of the chinese places around the Glendale/West Phoenix area.  It's very nice and clean inside if you want to dine in.  Can't say that for other chinese places."}
{"text":"The shrimp in lobster sauce I had last nights was actually pretty good. The woman who was nearly impossible to understand on the phone called it \"shrimp with vegetables IN lobster sauce\" it was close enough. It did however have a bit too much broccoli for my taste and the sauce was a bit watery, I'm used to a more viscose lobster sauce. The egg drop soup was also good, but the fact that it had corn in it threw me off a bit. Overall a good experience and I will definitely be back, a little further away that other Chinese places closer to my home, but well worth the drive. My only complaint is that the bottled sodas were $2 and you have to pay .25¢ for chili oil."}
{"text":"I love this place. Try the sesame chicken - the sauce tastes almost like honey. And the crab rangoons are the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"The best Chinese in this area hands down! Always made fresh to order, generous portions, fair prices, friendly staff! Simply can't complain! Thanks Yans for making my lunch decision easy!!! Only way it could get better is by offering an all you can eat buffet!!!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese for a fast easy fix. I've been going here for years! Orange chicken is my families favorite! The pork egg foo young has a ton of vegetables and is worth your dollar. The staff is friendly and the location is clean. Only down side was the bathroom door doesn't shut it seems to be jammed."}
{"text":"Easy Choice for Quick Chinese  Dropped in due to proximity to Banner Estrella.  Good little place for fast Chinese food.  It's not the authentic stuff Ma cooks, but still good.  There are the usual compromises between Asian and North American pallets-- more oil, less cooking with spicy peppers, and the light seasonings are lost in the salt and sugar.    Staff is quick with the takeout orders and very nice.  Affordable lunch specials, too.  I would go again."}
{"text":"Sorry to say but you Yelpers let me down on this one. The food was mediocre. I ordered the Volcano Beef, it wasn't that spicy and the meat was on the chewy side, a couple of pieces unedible. The lo mein was thick like spaghetti. The egg drop soup had a strange appearance, almost foamy or frothy. It was extremely hot, but not very tasty. The woman at the counter was friendly and this seems like a family run business, all that being said I just didn't like the food. Grade: C-"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this location as I had been to the one in Goodyear once before and it was decent. Ordered online and picked it up on my way home from work. Waited an extra 10 minutes after the pickup time, but that wasn't a big deal. Got the Teriyaki Chicken, Orange Beef, Vegetable Fried Rice, and Wonton Soup. It was a ton of food! I weighed it when I got home... over 5 pounds. At first I thought they gave me sesame chicken instead of teriyaki because it had sesame seeds on top, but when I removed the lid, I saw it wasn't breaded and that it was teriyaki after all. I did not like the chicken... it had a weird consistency... not like any chicken I'm used to. I'm not sure how to describe it, but it wasn't normal. The orange beef was decent, but there were a couple bites I had to spit out due to bone and gristle. The fried rice was pretty good, but the sesame oil flavor was very prevalent. The wontons in the soup were fine, but I didn't really like the flavor of the broth. And then I discovered there were shrimp at the bottom of the container. Yuck! I didn't know the wonton soup had shrimp! That's enough to make me lose my appetite..."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, price was pretty good, but the lack of atmosphere and food being served on Styrofoam plates was a bit of a turn off."}
{"text":"is tasted really good... but my daughter & I had bad tummy aches afterward:("}
{"text":"love love love this place  spent so much time he manager always comes over and sits with us when we eat..  need more chop stick action in phoenix..  but will drive/ride when ever the hunger hits..!!!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. We would order a bunch of food and it was all excellent. Last handful of times though it's gone from not very good to actually being bad. I went tonight for the first time in a long time and ordered three dishes. After tasting them, two went directly into the garbage. Really was hoping for a good experience tonight but I don't think I will be back.  I'm giving two stars instead of one because the people there are very nice and the one dish tonight that was good was very good."}
{"text":"The place is small and has inexpensive decor. Drinks from fountain machine had funny taste, could have easily been the ice. Food was not that good. I had sesame chicken combo with fried rice and spring rolls. Chicken was okay, sauce was sticky and sweet, fried rice was crunchy and simply yellow rice,very dry. Spring rolls were previously frozen since the inside was doughy. My husband had Mongolian Beef had a smoked flavor and wasn't  spicy at all. His rice and spring rolls was same. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Sorry but this is probably some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had. I'll stick to wok wei for west valley Chinese food near me for now"}
{"text":"Food is always good and fresh. We always get the crab ragoons, bbq pork chowmein, and fried rice. Generous portions."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the 1st time today. Great Chinese Food! We've eaten at many various Asian restaurants over the years including \"Chinatowns\" in many big cities around this country/in Canada and Yan's stacks up very well to the quality of dishes we had. We ordered the Kung Pao Tofu and Green Beans in black bean sauce. Both had great flavor/complexity from the sauces, generous serving sizes, good quality produce, and we were very filled up and I especially have a big appetite. The restaurant looked clean as were the restrooms. Friendly service.  This is our go to place for Chinese food. Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"Service is good....but there's def much better chinese food out there."}
{"text":"Good food great for take out to take to work. Always ready when I come to pick up. Really like their shrimp fried rice and soups."}
{"text":"Amazing, I was hesitant towards trying this place especially since I could goto panda, but I have to say it is the most amazing Chinese food I have tried! Not only is the food amazing, but their service is fantastic also! A must try for anyone who likes chinese! Skip panda and come here: better prices and a way better taste. My new every other day spot for me! Keep up the awesome work!"}
{"text":"We are constantly on the search for good Chinese in the west valley. So instead of hitting up the usual we decided to give Yan's a try. The good: The restaurant is very nice inside and clean. You can see in the back where they are cooking and it looks nice.  The food came out to is quickly and the staff was extremely friendly. It was also very reasonable prices. Two combination dinners for under $14.  The food was pretty good. The only thing I didn't care for was the fried rice. It was pretty bland and tasteless.  The bad: The only bad thing was the portion size was pretty small. While honestly it was enough for me I love having left overs for lunch the next day. My husband has a big appetite and could have eaten another order. I guess the search continues."}
{"text":"We were wanting to try somewhere new since we haven't found a great Chinese place in the last 4 years of living in Arizona. We ordered Orange Chicken, Volcano Beef, Pad Thai, egg rolls and crab puffs.  Let me just sum it up....we ate about 2 bites of each dish because it was just gross. What a bust. We spent nearly $40 on a mistake. The only item that was worth a darn was the crab puffs. They were actually kind of good. So if you need a snack, grab some crab puffs but leave the rest behind. Yuck."}
{"text":"Yans is always hot and fresh. I think they are one of the better places to eat in Goodyear. I like their orange chicken."}
{"text":"Great staff, great food, always fresh, always delicious!  Yan's is our go to familt place."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and the prices are reasonable for the portions. Ideally it's enough for a family to share. The mongolian beef is the best. We love the egg fried rice (it has no veggies for those who don't like it). I usually get take out its best to check the order before leaving  because the person who does the phone order couldn't understand me and I had trouble understanding them."}
{"text":"I kind of believed the other reviews so I decided to try it.  The food was very bland and seemed like everything was low in salt.  Quantity was good.  We had Kung Pao chicken which was probably the best out of the three.  We also had Shrimp chow mein and sweet and sour chicken.  All very bland.  I don't need it to be crazy spicy or anything but just some flavor.  Save your money and just go to Panda Express.  And no I don't work for Panda.  We won't be going back.  Just my 2 cents!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Goodyear for 10 years and have tried this place a few times. When they first opened they were decent. But sadly, my recent experience proves they've let all quality and care go by the wayside. I just had surgery the day before we ordered so I really wanted some decent food. Ordered: honey shrimp- SO strange. Battered pieces were huge as if it were battered fish, yet cut it open and there was one smaaaaall shrimp inside. If I had felt better I would have taken a photo it was so sad and comical. And tastes gross. Wonton soup: no words for how bland and disgusting this was. Seriously. Teriyaki chicken: I asked for sauce on the side. I got a container full of BOILED chicken with zero seasoning, with disgusting sugary syrup style teriyaki sauce on the side. It was impossible to eat. Even Panda Express teriyaki chicken is so so much better than this!! Crab Rangoons: purses of overstuffed lumps of cream cheese. No crab. Fried cheese balls. Gross. House fried rice: this was the only decent thing that we were able to eat.  We spent $40 and threw most of the food away. Shameful and awful. I will NOT be getting food from Yans again."}
{"text":"Have been there a handful of times. The food has always been excellent! The portions are large. The pan fried dumplings are my favorite and the pineapple fried rice is something else!  It's all so very very good!"}
{"text":"My poor husband came into this restaurant yesterday at noon and ordered their Yum Yum Chicken. While he was waiting for his order he heard a microwave being operated in the back! When he got his chicken home and proceeded to eat it. He ate one piece of chicken and noticed it lacked \"freshness.\" He had me taste it to make sure and I immediately spit it out!! It had the flavor of tainted meat all in my mouth and the chicken was so rubbery!! My husband now has mild food poisoning today, thanks to Yan's and has not been able to eat a decent meal today because of it and other unpleasant symptoms.  Too many a times have they served us bunk food....Forget this place, I'm never being disappointed here again!!!  Where can I find some real chinese food around here??   No where. Guess I'll save my appetite for California, where all the food is fresh."}
{"text":"The beef fried rice is always on point.  My kids love the teriyaki chicken.  We always get it to go. They pack the food in the containers.  Always leftovers."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food, however, it's hard to find a place that is good. This place by far is the best I've had. The prices are cheap for all the food you get. The best thing is they aren't stingy with the meat. I had a ton of shrimp and chicken in my rice. The service is good and fast!  I definitely will be coming back and recommending this place."}
{"text":"Hawaiian fried rice is the best . I order the same dish  every time I go there . Good food good prices and very good portions ."}
{"text":"Small place, nothing fancy but the food is pretty good. Prices are cheap, food was hot and fresh. The menu says they don't use MSG, they don't serve food on plates it comes in styrofoam containers. We would go again but take out, opposed to sticking around. We ordered Kung Pao Chicken which is really tasty, has peanuts in it.. which honestly that was my first time ever ordering Kung Pao Chicken from anywhere so I didn't know they were in there but honestly it was good and I'm not really a fan of peanuts. I'll be back though"}
{"text":"Worts Chinese food I've had in my entire life. We were sitting at our table watching people walk in thinking \"noooo don't do it\". The wings were horrendously salty and the meat looked undercooked, gelatinous and old. The vegetables were the worst though, it tasted like they were soaked in toilet water, no joke. It was the biggest waste of food and money I've ever spent at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Called in a order to go they said 19 to 15 minutes. I get there and no order  one hr later still no order they gave my order to someone else. Do they say sorry no to they offer me anything why I am waiting no. Every time we order to go we have a issue. I guess this will be my last time as they do have good food. Just a same they do not care"}

{"text":"Purely institutional Chinese food, almost like the cooks at Banner Hospital across the street made it. Uncle Ben would be proud. MRE Chinese! Ha ha You don't need taste buds to eat here!"}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food ever. I came into Yan ' craving some Chinese food. While we sat waiting for our food we helped ourselves at the soda machine, I literally spit the soda out thinking it was a diet sprite due to the after taste. I went up for coke, only to get the same reaction. When the food arrived it looks great, but after biting into the broccoli it had that same gross after taste.  The broccoli was extra watery and the juices had the same horrible after taste. My only way to describe the taste is sewer water. I don't write reviews but felt the need when a restaurant's food literally makes me spit it out and leave my food behind."}
{"text":"Always clean,always super FAST,  always friendly, always fresh food with lots of fresh veggies in the volcano beef. The entree portions are huge so its easy to share. .  They will make your dish  as spicy or as bland as you request.  Its not a fancy   restaurant ...but its bright and clean. Customers place  orders at the counter and pay,  then sit at a table. Your food will be brought to you very quickly! We often order take out and its ready  super fast!  This is our favorite Chinese place!"}
{"text":"This is excellent Americanized Chinese food for a decent price. The fried items have always been spot on. Highly suggest dining in. They will take good care of you."}
