{"text":"Really liked this place. The food was extremely delicious and the dessert to die for. Great ambiance and very friendly service. One of the best value for money. A very pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"The bartenders are amazing and make quality drinks. Great product knowledge and friendly professional service!!!"}
{"text":"Food was not very good. Went with 3 other friends, we ordered the pigeon, the skate, fried chicken, and lobster. We did not finish the food, it was fairly bland and over priced. We were there on a Tuesday night. The service was good, waiter was attentive and had quick seating, but would not return. There are far better places to eat in Las Vegas than this place."}
{"text":"Surprise this place isn't busier or talked abt like other places.  We had impeccable service with great food.  Available on open table for reservations.  Definitely for the party crowd (everyone dressed up to eye candy level while they took me in with w sweats on) but that's just the entire hotel atmosphere.  It is extremely loud in there from the music but at least it's good 80s-90s r and b upbeat/club type that's enjoyable, sorry not rave like but you can get that at the club in Vegas."}
{"text":"What a great spot! I had dinner here and it was delicious! With a very modern saloon style atmosphere, Blue Ribbon offers an eclectic menu of steaks, oyster bar, fried chicken, fish, soups and salads, and much more. They had this neat veil that came across the middle of the restaurant to separate the bar from the dining room for private parties which was really different.  Our bartender Shea was great! He was friendly, he knew just what to suggest, and he was funny. We had the house cabernet which was Bench 2015 and it is now my favorite cabernet. I even went out to buy some from the liquor store yesterday.  For an appetizer my friend and I had the shrimp and lobster cocktail. They were both chilled and succulent. Next we had the endive salad. The blue cheese, arugula, and beets were put together well, however I wasn't a huge fan of the endives. None the less still satisfying.  For entrees we had the 12oz NY Strip prepared medium with a red wine reduction sauce that was perfect! The steak was cooked properly, the meat was tender, and the sauce was scrumptious!  The fried chicken was our second entrée and it had to be the best fried chicken I've ever had!! Definitely recommend! It was crispy, salty, a little spicy, and the meat was moist. So good oh my goodness! I could rave about this all night. The only thing I wasn't too much a fan of was the gravy on the mash, it was a bit sweet like honey.   Overall, this restaurant was great! The service was excellent and so was the food!"}
{"text":"Excellent cannot even describe the delicate fresh food blue ribbon served. The filet was medium rare with truffle butter. Perfectly prepared and melted in my mouth--barely a need to chew. The baby squid was sautéed perfectly and the texture was unbelievable! So tender with just enough of the chew one longs for in squid. The oysters were fresh and tasted like the ocean. The mignonette was classic and they also offered a fresh pico which was also a delight.   A highlight of sauce was the habenero carrot sauce. This is so spicy but flavorful with a bit of sweet at the end. I'm a hot sauce snob and this sauce left me wanting more. I ate the bread with it and almost finished the bottle.   Highly recommend blue ribbon."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and the service is outstanding.  We enjoyed our meals, but we didn't love them.  I had the pork chop, and the chop itself was mediocre.  The peas and mashed potatoes were delicious and made the dish.  My wife had the Bronzino.  She also loved the sides that came with it and thought her fish was so-so.  This is definitely a nice place to eat, but I can't give it 5 stars due to the fish and pork chop being a little bland."}
{"text":"Great service.  Unusual food. Great atmosphere.   This is a great restaurant. The first time we ate here, the West Coast oysters were amazing and the East Coast were a close second. We ate there last night for the second time and the west coast were not as good. But the staff insisted replacing them.   The service is amazing and the pigeon is exquisite. It was my first time trying it. I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"First, the bread was amazing but you only get 3 slices in the basket but when we asked for more they gave it to us. The bread was warm and the butter was soft and was easy to spread  We ordered the \"Bucket\" of wings for our appetizer and it was amazing you could literally see the seasoning, it was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The wasabi honey sauce that came with it was okay.  I ordered the salmon and my husband got the hanger steak. My salmon came with two sides but our server neglected to tell us this information. The steak did not come with a side so my we ordered mash potatoes because we were told that the entrees didn't come with a side. The portion of steak was very small but it tasted good. The salmon was juicy but it was just ok.   Our server Jason was wonderful, the staff was very pleasant and the atmosphere was really nice."}
{"text":"Ordered lamb chops and oysters and both dishes were absolutely fantastic. It was a perfect medium and melted in the mouth. Service was absolutely excellent and Tara who served us and Hoover were amazing. Would definitely recommend this place to everyone who comes to VEgas."}
{"text":"This place is really nice and inviting.  If you like a more lit setting, then definitely come here. (Compared to STK across from this place).  From when you walk inside you can feel this really cool vibe with cool lighting.  There is a bar right when you walk in with televisions on the side of the restaurants hung on the walls yet still a classy vibe.  In addition, the music and the wines in the middle make it really trendy as well.    Food:  lots of great choices however since I was not too hungry, we ordered the seafood platter & hanger steak. Both were amazing as you can see on my photo.  The specialty drinks are my favorite.    Service: Fast and on point. They kept checking in on us to make sure we had enough to eat and drink. Food came out in good time. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Started with salt and Pepper  shrimp! Wonderful shrimp scampi style over lettuce with a slight hint of red pepper, sea salt and chunks of black pepper! I had the rack of lamb! Very nice chops, very juicy and served with a gravy sauce! I had rack of lamb at STK and preferred it over this style, but both were good! Our daughter loved the salmon with asparagus and if you love fried chicken, don't miss theirs! Nabil was our server and he was incredible! New we were going to a show and got everything to us quickly!"}
{"text":"Casual upscale place at the Cosmo in Vegas. Great service everyone engaging and even management chipping in. Modern vintage contemporary date night happy hour business venue all in one neat area. Good variety of Asian, American, speciality food. Drink options seem a bit limited but otherwise very fresh ingredients. Seen like a place of many business dinners. Came for boyfriend birthday celebration - jeans dressy shirt seem suitable attire however feel free to dress up as I wore an equivalence to a cocktail dress. Order a long island and black label over the rocks. Entree was their fried chicken and rack of lamb medium rare. Their danish blue dressing is amazing !!!! Food was tasty flavorful and tender. Portions were perfect! I am all about not being hungry after spending a bit - Bill wasn't bad and under than what was expected but the con was seeing a $2 charge for an ice cube and no communication about it - but besides that will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow. Great service and great food. Everything from the cocktails to the plates were fantastic. Did the steak tartar, fresh oysters, and the fried chicken wings. Our server Joey had great recommendations and also coursed our meal perfectly. His service was top notch. Def recommend this place for good food and drinks. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I visited the Blue Ribbon with a group of 30 for a friends birthday. We had the private room and a set/limited menu. The seafood tower was amazing as well as the salads. I ordered the steak which was delicious, however when I saw some of my friends fried chicken I was pretty jealous. I was lucky enough to get a taste and oh my. The most crispy and juicy fried chicken I've ever had. I also tasted the mashed potatoes which were perfect. We had the chocolate chip bread pudding and it was delicious. The private room was simple but perfect for our group. The service was great but i did feel like the server needed a little more help at times. But i really have no complaints. There was a man there in the beginning that may have been the GM or event Coordinator but he was very nice and seemed in control of everything. I would love to go back again."}
{"text":"The lobster tails were not cleaned properly and had green goo in the middle. I ate some of it and was sick a few hours later. I had the filet for my entree which was cooked well and was tender, however, it is unacceptable for a nice restaurant to not know how to properly clean shellfish (especially when you are spending around $200 for the seafood tower). I will not be back for that reason."}
{"text":"Elevated soul food is how I would describe it.  The fried chicken,mashed potatoes and gravy were awesome! My husband had Steak and collard greens and he loved both. The place has a nice ambience and the staff were very friendly . I'm going back in February ! Damn , I had pics but I must of deleted them. I'll take some the next time."}
{"text":"Recently went to dine at Blue Ribbon Brasserie at the Cosmopolitan before attending a show there. Was looking for something not too fine dining, casual and fun and this place was spot on! The menu is what I would consider more 'American' with emphasis on seafood including a seafood 'raw' bar. Oddly enough, we tried their version of a Chinese classic - the 'Pu Pu Platter'! LOL So their version included: a BBQ Chicken Wing, Pork Spare Rib, Sesame Shrimps, Fried Oyster, Chicken Skewer and a Duck Egg Roll. Now it is $20 per person but as you can see a good sampling of different items - the bbq chicken wing is more 'lollipop' style and the sesame shrimp and spare rib were amongst the favorites. We also had the Fried Catfish sandwich and it was good portion sized - nice and crispy outside and juicy on the inside. We also had one of their signature deserts: Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding featuring Vanilla Ice Cream & Hot Fudge - ideal for sharing. A good music mix was playing and the restaurant had a nice energy - and we enjoyed great and consistent service from Ken. Would highly recommend as a fun, casual option or a place to hang out with friends and enjoy appetizers, raw bar and cocktails. Hope to visit again soon. Check it out!"}
{"text":"There are so many dining experiences to choose from while staying at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas. My fiancé and I remember Blue Ribbon when it was strictly a sushi restaurant. A few months ago when we were in Vegas we wanted to go there for sushi and realized it no longer existed. It ended up going through a restructuring of its menu and now it's serves American fare. When Adam saw that menu, he wanted to dine there the first night. Since I was really craving sushi, we decided on Zuma for the first night (review posted below.) The second night, I knew he had his heart on Blue Ribbon so we dined there. We went to at about 6 PM on a Sunday night and were able to be seated right away. It was not very busy at all since we showed up early so we didn't need a reservation. I would recommend making one if you're planning to eat later in the evening. We were approached right away by our server, Mark. He did a wonderful job in explaining the menu's most popular items, the size of the servings, and checked up on us  just the right amount. Not so much that it was annoying, but often enough that if we needed something he was right there. We decided to get all dressed up and treat ourselves to some fancy Las Vegas food. I love the atmosphere. As soon as you walk in, it looks like swanky and hip meets classy and sophisticated. It is apparent that they worked very hard to revamp this place. I always loved it when I was a sushi restaurant, too. The only thing that seems familiar about the venue is the bathroom. Once we sat down, took our photos, breathed in the ambience of the place, and studied the menu - we realized that we were both starving. A full day at the pool with very little to eat made us want to order almost everything on the menu. We decided to start out with the wedge salad. It was absolutely delicious. They also bring out bread with the most delicious tasting better. I highly recommend splurging on that. Adam ordered the PuPu platter which was a mix of wings, shrimp, ribs, and a few other delicious items. I got the salmon served with mashed potatoes, veggies, topped with potato crisps. All photographed below. Because we were starving, we shared everything and it was the perfect amount of food. We were full and knew we were not going to get dessert, but I asked for the menu anyway. We didn't order anything so I don't know how it tasted, but I wasn't really impressed with the dessert menu. Overall, this is a perfect Las Vegas dining experience. Complete with excellent service, a good variety of food items, and a great atmosphere. Enjoy!."}
{"text":"Service 4/5, Food 3/5, and ambiance 4/5  I guess if I could give this place a 3.5 stars, I would, however the food just didn't cut it for me to give them 4 stars. I came here with my family as we usually stay at the Cosmopolitan a few times a year. In November of 2016, I came to the old Blue Ribbon sushi and grill restaurant and was blown away by their omakase course. Everything was fabulous.....so when we found out that Blue Ribbon reopened, we were super excited.   But.....this place is completely different. It's not a Japanese restaurant...there is no sushi. I think that they were going for a fusion thing, but adding some yellowtail sashimi, oshibori (wet towels), and chopsticks to eat with, doesn't really make this Japanese. This place gives off a funky upbeat steak and seafood vibe that caters toward wine and cocktail drinkers.   [The restaurant]  Ambiance is nice and dimly lit with a classy feel.  The music is a mix of funky upbeat 80s vibe , but the music was way too loud. It made it hard to hear the waiters and the other people in our party.   [The food]  -Drink // A Letter to Rio // 13.00 // cacheca, prosecco, honey, and lime juice was decent but is on a stronger side and isn't sweet at all. So if you like sweet drinks you may want to opt for the sangria.   -complimentary // bread // delicious! Probably one of my favorite things here beside the fois gras.   -appetizer // the platter // 81.00 // mix of raw oysters, raw clams, shrimp cocktail, rock crab claws, lobster tail, and jumbo sweet shrimp. This platter was decent, but it lacked flavor. The butter aioli tasted bland and was too thick. I would have just preferred melted butter and lemon. My oyster was a bit slimy (but I just think I'm not much of an oyster fan). My brother said that his had sand in it.   -appetizer // fois gras // 26.00. // very rich and served with toast. This was tasty. The candied apples added a nice sweetness to it.   -appetizer // yellowtail jalapeño sashimi // 22.00 // it was too spicy with that jalapeño with all the seeds still in it. Thin pieces seemed too pricey for what you can get elsewhere.   -entree // shrimp Provençal // 28.00 // this was one of the recommended items by our waiter. It was meh. In my opinion, the cream sauce was too salty and didn't have any flavor to it. I liked the noodles though and they gave 6 prices of shrimp!   Overall, this place had a nice atmosphere for a date but not for a family dinner. The waitress was super nice and gave my baby sister a pen and paper to draw with. My family wasn't impressed by the steak or lamb, they thought the steak was overdone. For the price, I would probably use that money and pay a little more for one of the other delicious restaurants in the Cosmo."}
{"text":"I only tried the Fried Chicken plate which included mashed potatoes and greens.  The best part about my dining experience here was the staff - friendly and excellent in service.  The fried chicken was cooked correctly - the chicken tender and moist and the fried batter crunchy as expected. But the food lacked any discernible flavor that would have me believe this was a fried chicken worthy of the praises I read online. Perhaps some side sauces would make the chicken a better taste experience, but I like fried chicken to stand on its own merits.  The greens included with the meal were too salty for me, but the mashed potatoes were the best tasting food on the plate, which I put to good use in mixing with the fried chicken.  For me the meal did not meet the level of the price paid.   Cheers"}
{"text":"We stopped here after being told we couldn't have \"just dessert\" at STK. The service was great, drinks were great and dessert was too. Thanks for having a great atmosphere and allowing us to end our night on a high note!"}
{"text":"We were a group of 7 and stopped in for some late night eats.  Given it was one of the few restaurants still open at 12am we figured they'd have good options for us.  Not really the case.  They had a few appetizers that were good for a small crowd but very little to choose from as far as meals unless you wanted something fussy like pigeon or duck.  Nit at midnight.  We orderrd the pupu platter which I was surprised to ser given the rest ofvthe menu.  It was okay.  Lots of fried things that I couldn't really identify though fairly tasty.  We also got a couple burgers and paella.  The bar burger was literally a piece of beef between two pieces of bread.  Nit even ketchup.  The blue ribbon burger was the other extreme.  The atmosphere was nice snd the service was very attentive.  Cocktail menu was very uninspiring."}
{"text":"This place is my new fav. While pricey the food is amazing.  Fried chicken is the best ever. You can make or have a few vegetarian and vegan options. Sides are great.   In all a great experience here."}
{"text":"Lovely place with attentive servers. Strong drinks with a fun atmosphere. We had a half lobster for an appetizer that was perfectly acceptable and a cheese platter that was delicious, and the bread was a winner as well. The Paella was the winning dish. Large enough for two and delicious. We each had a cocktail so we skipped dessert. Lots of fried chicken and French fries passed our table, so lots of choices for all ages. I would definitely bring out of town guests here."}
{"text":"Well thought out menu, fresh, and cooked to perfection. Cocktails were mixed properly, service was A+   We went here for dinner before a show at Cosmo. Casual is dressy but not too formal.   Dinner I had the crab Louie salad- I shared it but could have eaten the whole thing. I also had yellowtail jalapeno shashimi and Clams. My friend had the matzo soup which was Amazing! My husband had the ribeye which was also good. Pretty much everything was top of the line eating.  For dessert we had the Bread pudding and banana split.   Keep in mind this is in the Cosmo so you need to allow 30min to park and walk up."}
{"text":"Fairly priced, great quality food, nice staff, cool interior decor. Does a mean steak"}
{"text":"What can I say..... I'm so happy to have Blue Ribbon back on the strip at the Cosmo! The Bromberg Bros have delivered once again. New creative brasserie menu but all of the favorites can still be found. I had the Blue Ribbon Burger and it was outstanding, it will be in the running for best burger in town in no time. Ask for Evan Polott, he will take great care of you and is a seasoned veteran in the business."}
{"text":"This is probably the most underrated restaurant in Cosmo.  Food and service is phenomenal and stays that way even if you are there late, as we were.  Some highlights:  Steak Tartare was perfect, flawless, phenomenal, and I would say the same about the Foie Gras appetizer.  I have no idea why the Paella was as good as it was, since there was no other item from Spanish cuisine on the menu, but there you have it, awesome.  Normally, I wouldn't waste too much time describing sides, but the Parmesan Truffle Fries and Fried Zucchini Sticks could well have been the highlight of the night.  A thoughtful wine list and great service checked our last boxes.  Recommended without reservation.  Really great."}
{"text":"Jason was our server, he and the rest of the staff was amazing. Oysters, Giant Tiger Shrimp and Rib-eye was delish!!!! It was an amazing experience. Can't wait to go back for more Oysters."}
{"text":"I was enjoying this great restaurant... it's appetizers, its cocktails/beers... the nice music ... the relaxing atmosphere... when Security and restaurant employees and hostesses informed us of ...\"Active Shooter.... Get Down\"!  We immediately had to dive onto the floor and stay there. After several minutes, we were alerted to get up and follow the security and staff into the back doors of the restaurant and into a more secluded area. There, we waited until a conference room was available and were ushered into this nice room with TV informing us of the tragic events taking place at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Resort. We were later allowed to leave and return to our rooms only. There was no gambling in the Cosmopolitan's lobby casinos !!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! The food, service, vibe - couldn't have asked for better. Highly recommend the fried chicken. Ask for the Wasabi honey and the special hot sauce. First went to the izakaya Blue Ribbon in New York and searched high and low for a fried chicken as good. Never found it until we came here. The batter they use is delicious and unparalleled. I don't want to oversell it, but I will always make a special trip here for the fried chicken anytime I'm in town. Also had a wonderful bottle of wine, recommended our server, which was very reasonably priced. They have a great variety of very gourmet choices so something for everyone. I was there on vacation but it seemed like a great place for a nice work dinner."}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars if it was the old blue ribbon I use to go to... it was still very nice we had great service and the food was good but I miss the old vibe and presentation they had before they changed everything. And they shouldn't have took out the fresh sushi bar and everything else"}
{"text":"I was left with the task of finding a restaurant to satisfy the taste buds of 6 different people, thankfully I chose Blue Ribbon.  The service was outstanding, we were greeted by everyone we passed and felt like royalty.  The ambiance and decor, spot on. And the food...the food was delicious. They offer a very eclectic menu so everyone was able to find something. My husband enjoyed his old fashioned and I ate every bite of my steak. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Was blessed and had an opportunity to dine at Blue Ribbon - Las Vegas at a private party after an event.  Really liked the vibe at this restaurant, it was dark, chill, inviting, but not stuffy.  I remember walking into this restaurant and thinking \"Wow, this place must be expensive...\", but I was surprised by the reasonable prices on their menu.  Most appetizer items run for about $20, whereas the entrees are about $30-$40 range with a few exceptions.  Since I was here with a large group of people, I got to sample many of the menu items.  My favorites: - Barbequed Duroc Pork Ribs: Served over a mini grill and glased with Sesame BBQ.  Sweet and cooked to perfection. - Rack of Lamb: Served with Spinach, Mashed Potatoes and Thyme.  They made it just the way I liked it - medium rare.  Oh yum!  Also tried their Cheese Fondue, Hummus, Paella Basquez that evening, but unfortunately, these items did not win my heart.  Nevertheless, service was excellent and the server kept our glasses filled.  Had an amazing time dining at the Blue Ribbon and would definitely be coming back again the next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant inside The Cosmopolitan. We ordered the royal seafood platter. It was fantastic! Do yourself a favor and get this platter. It is plenty for 2-3 people as an appetizer. The seafood was very fresh. I had the salmon dish. It was cooked exactly to my liking. Our server was attentive. We never had to ask for anything or wait for anything. It was a great dinning experience."}
{"text":"From our experience last night, I can't understand how this place is not five stars! We started off at the bar, and the bartenders were so friendly and fun that we almost decided to dine there. Unfortunately, sitting side by side doesn't lend for easy conversation with a group. So we moved to a table.  The ambiance/decor is hip but comfortable.  We were greeted by every staff member we passed. Our server was friendly, professional, attentive, and uniquely polite. He would wait a few feet away when he realized we were in a serious point of our conversation instead of bulldozing over just to get what he needed done.  The menu is varied and interesting that it was difficult to decide what to order, which I love. We started with a 1/2 dozen east coast oysters and steak tartare. Both of which were absolutely delicious. I could've ordered another steak tartare as my entree. One of us had the fried chicken and two of us had the filet with truffle butter. C'MON. Perfectly cooked and every bite was well seasoned. We shared the sweet potato side, and although I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes, I could've licked the bowl clean.  I ordered the John Daly to drink (three to be exact). It was very well balanced and consistent in its delicious taste all three times.  I already plan to go back with several friends for a birthday celebration. Hoping more people give this place a shot so the overall review score can be fixed!"}
{"text":"The overall experience at Blue Ribbon in the Cosmo is awesome.  This was my second visit here.  The location is on the 3rd floor next to secret pizza.  The inner pyro in me was a huge fan of the blue tipped matches that they have in the matchboxes up in front.    Appetizers:  Oysters - you can get a selection of east coast or west coast.   Wings - Fried and seasoned to perfection.  I felt like these were better than the entree fried chicken.  There's more seasoning on these. Yellowtail jalapeno sashimi - light and tasty but with a slight kick from the jalapeno. Hummus - very creamy and robust in flavor  Entrees:  Fried chicken: Similar to the wings but you're getting more of the chicken.   I like the appetizer wings better, but if you're not ordering those, definitely get this. Skate - This time I decided to be a little more adventurous and order the skate.  At first my friends and I had no idea what it was but I figured why not try it out.  I figured at worst the potatoes, bacon, and shrimp that it comes with would be a solid consolation prize.  All of it works together very well.  Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding.  It's a smaller portion where 1 bread pudding fan could easily finish this alone.  Sorry friends, next time I'm not sharing. Sundae.  This was amazing. It's also fairly big in size, so this is probably a better dessert that you can share.  Tip:  ask for the hot sauces if you like a little spice in your life."}
{"text":"The environment here was very nice and fun. The live DJ played great music as we enjoyed the fresh baked basket of bread and butter. The service was great and they were onlooking and I never had an empty glass of water or beer. My wife had the duck breast and cauliflower purée. Her duck was perfectly cooked and she loved the orange sauce on the side of the plate. The cauliflower purée left my wife very pleased. She loved the purée so much, she asked for more it. They brought her a bowl of it which was very nice.   I ordered the lobster. It was perfect and was served with two sides. It came with corn and a baked potato. The corn on the cob and the baked potato did not have any flavor and I did not finish them. The lobster was melt in your mouth and buttery. The large portion food and service was well worth the price tag. For the two dishes and two beers with tip we paid $137.99.  It was well worth the price and I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I miss the old blue ribbon.... the new menu didn't have the same quality. The fried chicken was too fat and the breading was too thick! How can you go wrong with such a simple dish? The sashimi was not the same quality as we used to get either. The only dish we enjoyed was baked oyster."}
{"text":"Great drinks and great vibes! I got the fried chicken. My friend got the ribs and they looked amazing! Drinks were excellent as well. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Had  a wonderful dinner here last night, before our show. The atmosphere is comfortable and classic. With the leather club chairs, cool lighting and linens.  We had reviewed the menu before our visit. I was set on the Fried Chicken dish, while my husband chose the Shrimp pasta dish. Both were delicious. The chicken was tender and tasty. Servings for both dinners were plentiful. We enjoyed our quiet dinner for two. Indeed would recommend  Blue Ribbon."}
{"text":"Never again in Vegas  I loved Blue Ribbon over the years in NYC through their various outlets.   Vegas - They no longer serve an extensive menu for sushi accordingly to the hostess. I'm guessing they are playing nice with Zuma across from them.  We ended up having a simple sashimi platter (good), onion soup (yum), steamed clams (yum), grilled asparagus (disappointed that they were just cooling off from ROOM TEMPERATURE. The bread basket was MEH, butter is better than the bread so they didn't think it needs to be good? Maybe?  Service was soo disappointing at Blue Ribbon Vegas that I won't be returning. We went to Giada the night before and the service was immaculate. What happened? It was 10pm, I ordered soup and sashimi right off the bat with our drinks. When the waiter came back to pour the wine, he didn't ask if we were ready to order more, he just left without eye contact. The same waiter didn't pick up finished plates. Things just piled up until the bus person picked it up. A different server ended up clearing the table when finished. He tried to wipe off crumbs and start cleaning the table, even came between me and my partner from behind only to brush off crumbs on our corner booth seat. The crumbs remained on the seat between us. He didn't wipe crumbs onto his own napkin... it was rude, ineffective, unnecessary. sigh. Just wait for us to leave couldn't you? There's nobody waiting for our table anyways!"}
{"text":"Blue Ribbon is excellent. The pupu platter and fire chicken are must gets, but everything we had was very good."}
{"text":"Look at all my yelp reviews they are mostly positive!  This restaurant is awful.  Service was horrible and salt and pepper shrimp had the skin on and it was hard to get the skin off the shrimp.  I'm sorry - I do not go out to dinner in Vegas to peel shrimp while fine dining.  They were on top of a salad!  Lame.  Sadly ribs were great because that was the only thing that gave them one star....  Raul was the captain on duty and he came by to check on our food and I explained the shrimp situation and he just shrugged  shoulders.  Lame.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"Love the original BR in NYC and had two great meals at the BR in the Cosmo while visiting Vegas twice in the last month. The special cold langostinos app and elevated west coast oysters almost Rockefeller app were really flavorful and both hit the mark. Bones (marrow and oxtail marmalade) were on point, as always, and the grilled calamari were super tender. The boneless ribeye was one of the best I've ever had, including steakhouses. All the dishes were delicious and the known BR hospitality was on full display both times. Thank you to our servers (Angelo last time) who were top notch and the front of the house (Chachi is simply awesome). As for cocktails/beverages, the wine list has some great variety and some tasty signature cocktails. Congrats on bringing the brasserie menu to Vegas. Looking forward to next time."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, ambience was perfect, customer service was outstanding. Very pleased, will return!"}
{"text":"Honestly I wasn't super impressed.  We started with the fried oysters.  The spinach part under the oyster was the best part of the dish. The peppered shrimp were pretty good.  The ponzu sauce that comes with them is amazing! My husband got the fried chicken and said the favoring was amazing!  The lobster was ok but not amazing! We did enjoy the drinks we had. The hummingbird was delicious!"}
{"text":"Being from Alberta we are pretty snobby when it comes to steaks that is until we hit this place up for dinner last week. Had the 16 oz NY strip with truffle mashed potatoes and I can confidently say that it was the best steak I have ever had. Service was great our glasses were never empty. Check this place out if you're in the Cosmo. We will definitely be back. Top shelf!!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken is amazing. Best in town. Ambiance and service by Manager Evans and Joey on top of taking care of customers. A must. Great seafood and steaks."}
{"text":"I must say, I absolutely love the Cosmo. Not only does it have that hip vibe unlike other hotel/casinos on the strip **cough cough Bellagio** but it has a really neat lineup of restaurants. Eggslut, Milkbar, Momofuku...just to name a few. I was also really intrigued to try the Wicked Spoon buffet, but came a few minutes too late, as they closed at 9pm. I am not sure why one of the most popular buffets in Vegas closes at 9, but I decided to give Blue Ribbon a shot.   The service was extremely friendly and I loved the vibe of the restaurant. But their famous fried chicken platter had much to be desired. The chicken was overcooked and bone dry on the inside. While the skin was super crispy, as a result, it lacked that certain \"slutiness\" I desire in a fried chicken. Honestly, I think I would have rather had Popeye's chicken. That's not a huge knock on Blue Ribbon, as I'm sure they would also acknowledge the fact that Popeye's chicken is pretty dang good, and lands at about 1/5th of the price tag. I would definitely come back next time I'm around these parts of town and try some of their other menu items. But my first time experience was average."}
{"text":"One of the coolest things I've seen, they give you a little grill to char your wings... this is so perfect and gives the best crisp to your wings.  Great bartenders as well, ready to make you whatever kind of craft cocktail you may be looking for. The cheese fondue dish was also amazing and great to share for the table.   Located on the 3rd floor of Cosmopolitan, it's definitely a go to place if you're staying in the hotel."}
{"text":"Worst service possible. They took away my menu before even ordering. If it wasn't for me reminding them they wouldn't have taken my order. The food was decent but didn't make up for the poor service. 0 stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I love oysters and fried chicken, so this menu turned my head.   West coast oysters-amazing   Salt and pepper shrimp-very tasty, shell is on and required some work.   Fried chicken-really delicious, not the best ever, but legit.  Scene is cafeteria like and doesn't match the vibe of the hotel. It felt a little cold.   Food and service was amazing, the ambiance was lackluster."}
{"text":"Such a great place to grab some great food on the Strip on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan. We ordered the Pu Pu Platter where you get to try 6 different items like spare ribs and shrimp with your own little hibachi grill. So fun and $20 per person!!!"}
{"text":"Blue Ribbon - noun - a badge made of blue ribbon and given as first prize to the winner of a competition.  This place definitely fell way short of that. Came here on Monday night with a group of my friends. It was an extremely slow night, but it seems like the place was definitely overstaffed. Seems like a great combo right? Nope. Our server was never to be found...wait...actually I found him just talking and with other servers with nothing else to do at the bar. Finally got his attention we decided to order some food, ordered the branzino, paella, French onion soup, and chicken sticks. I'm not quiet sure what this restaurant's theme is, but the branzino was prepared as California style with guac and corn. Paella was good and it was packed with seafood, which is obviously Spanish. Then the French Onion soup (you should know where that's from) was too sweet. Then the chicken sticks...ground up chicken fried and served with honey wasabi sauce (Southern?). Oh yea, there's also oysters, matzo ball soup, and fondue.   Is this restaurant trying a little too hard? Yes, I would definitely say so.  Also, asked the server what the well rye whiskey was, he answered \"I'm not sure, probably Jack Daniel's.\" Seriously...please train your servers of the restaurant's basics. We were the only table that's bigger than a 2 top and the manager never came over to check on us, and actually the server had difficult looking for him when he needed his manager approval at the POS.  Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great food and very experienced wait staff.  The branzino, fried chicken and langoustines were amazing!  I would eat here every time in las Vegas.  Solid meal just a bit on the high $ side.  Our best idea was to bring our own mixed drinks in cups to keep the price reasonable."}
{"text":"I wanted to really like this place, as I do almost about everything in the Cosmo...but this place is gross! We ordered the lobster from the raw bar and it still had green intestine guts throughout the majority of the lobster. Our waiter and the manager came over and said that this was a delicacy to many people. I beg to differ, it was nasty to the point where I legit puked in the bathroom after seeing it and sent it back. I really thought the intestine crap may have been some swanky avocado spread that they were fusioning it with. After I tasted it, I was repulsed and grossed out for the rest of the night. I know it's a raw bar, but that still means you need to be clean and sanitary doesn't it? They replied with how I should have ordered steamed lobster instead, but with that reasoning you are telling me to order the green gut intestines warmed up instead of cold...makes no sense. My wife got the fried chicken, which honestly tasted like it was some Popeyes garbage. Onion soup was nothing to rave about either. Love the places to eat in the Cosmo, but this one has to go!"}
{"text":"This place is nice, which is about standard for the location. We got in right away which was good. Prices weren't terrible, again considering the location. We had a couple cocktails and shared the filet. The filet was excellent. The cheese fondue was also really good. I wish I could have tried the sushi. Good ambiance. Lots of people, including the obvious prostitutes walking from table to table, probably trying to get free drinks. They were high-end prostitutes, so we weren't too offended. Plus it was a Friday night. The only problem we had was with the service. Our waiter was terrible. Honestly, he probably makes more money than I do, but he doesn't have to be a snob.  Hey Nabil! I'm not sure why you grabbed our check before we left, but I noticed that you were disappointed with the amount of tip we left you. Just so you know, we're not cheap. You're just a terrible server. You're an arrogant prick that should probably be working at a prison cafeteria rather than a nice place like Blue Ribbon.   Don't know her name but we wish the girl that brought us our cheese fondue was our server. She was very friendly. We will go again because the food and ambiance was nice. Hopefully we get a different server."}
{"text":"The environment is so welcoming and unique, the bar is right in the front when you walk in the layout is pretty big, in the back right corner there is a raw bar. The staff that assisted us where very friendly and helpful.   We love fried chicken so we had to try this place out to see what its all about. We had the bucket of chicken and the cheese fondue, it was so crispy and the sauce was amazing. We will be coming back here on our future trips for more fried chicken."}
{"text":"I needed to kill some time, so I sat at a bar for a drink.  Well, that one drink turned into 3 and oysters.  The bartenders are fabulous and kept us single diners (drinkers?) entertained.  They have a good selection of specialty cocktails and also use those custom ice cubes that are clear and like 2 inches wide to not dilute the drink.  The only thing missing here were light appetizer selections for people who didn't want a full meal but needed something to much on in the bar.  Otherwise I enjoyed Blue Ribbon and would recommend a visit if youre at the cosmo."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food.  The restaurant has a very warm atmosphere.   It is definitely a return to restaurant.   The bronzini and oysters were amazing."}
{"text":"Good but not great. Tons of better options in the Cosmopolitan. I went with friends so we got the cheese fondue which was awesome, we got fried chicken as entrees because that's what they are known for. I was a bit disappointed. Service was not on point and the fried chicken wasn't amazing. I've been to most of the restaurants in cosmopolitan and this one would be my least"}
{"text":"Group of friends decided to try this out.  Decor was very classy.  Oyster bar was so cute and adorable.  We had a great time there and almost all of us had to be rolled out bc we were so full.  I think we ordered way too much food.   Fried chicken was super yummy with their wasabi honey sauce and service was amazing.  Attentive,  friendly,  informative and made us all feel at home."}
{"text":"We just flew back in from Hawaii for a couple days and I was craving STK.  when we got here we were asked if we like seafood and I was like duh, hellz yeah.  So they told us to go check out Blue Ribbon.  They have a dress code which is nice since not all places at the Cosmo care about the way people dress.  We were dressed fine (as usual) and got a great seat and great service.  When we sat down we immediately got drinks then appetizers and our entrees came within 15 minutes.  The food was great.  I enjoyed the seafood but next time we come here I'll have to try the fried chicken as it looks amazing.  The cocktails were great.  We will definitely be back for more form this establishment."}
{"text":"Ugh another nasty overpriced Las Vegas spot. I had the fried chicken and the onion soup. Onion soup tasted like Campbell's, but with cheese melted on top. Good, but it should have been $0.99, like Campbell's. Chicken was okay, as if they bought some KFC and plated it nicely. We were so annoyed when we left. My husband said I told you we should have gone to Momofuku next door. Oh well."}
{"text":"The blue ribbon is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  I cant really attest to much accept their amazing fried chicken.  Their chicken is cooked to order and served with a honey wasabi sauce on the side.  The chicken is always cooked PERFECT. Not too much breading. Also has a sprinkle of spice on it.  The chicken can be served as normal size pieces or wings. Their appetizers are also amazing. We usually do the meatballs.  The service we get there is always over the top.  Blue ribbon is in the cosmopolitan casino."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. I've been there twice and the service is always excellent! Our waiter Johnny was wonderful! And the food, omg the food! I had the flatiron steak. Oh it was so good. The Parmesan truffle fries are to die for and their mashed potato are heaven. We had their foie gras as an appetizer and now I have ran out of superlatives to say how good it was. It's not cheap but not ridiculously over priced either. It's my favorite place to eat in town for dinner these days and I can't recommend it any higher"}
{"text":"I'm sad to know that this is no longer the sushi side of blue ribbon... Their ox tail fried rice was so good! I gave them a try anyways once I heard that this is a popular restaurant in New York. They didn't disappoint! Amazing food and service... Their cocktails are delicious as well. Great size portions at a reasonable price, will be back here next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"A great new restaurant in our favorite resort. The Cosmopolitan has so many great selections, STK for steak, Zuma for asian, and now the reinvented Blue Ribbon. First off, great service, Jorge was great. We had a semi private booth on the left side as you walk in, nice for date night if you like sitting close to your partner ;-) My man and I love oysters, and we were not disappointed, 6 each from east and west coast. Well shucked, no stray shells, very important when slurping em up. We also shared a classic shrimp cocktail,  Main course , fried chicken for me, nice crunchy coating, extra juicy inside, half a bird, so I needed help in finishing it. He enjoyed a perfectly cooked bone in rib eye, charred pittsburgh style  For dessert, a selection of sorbets and ice cream for a perfect finish  This will be on our dine again list when we return in January."}
{"text":"Damn good Fried Chicken and a fun PuPu Platter despite only having one of each item."}
{"text":"My first experience at Blue Ribbon is the Miami location and I'm obsessed with that one. I was super stoked to try Blue Ribbon grille after hearing that their menu was French! We started off their vodka Arnold palmer type of cocktail, jasmine tea, spare ribs as an appetizer and a side of their sesame shrimp skewers. This cocktail packs a secret punch, doesn't taste like there's even a drop of alcohol but you'll definitely feel it before knowing it! prefer drinks crafted like this! A fusion of teas infused with vodka mixed with lemonade. Those shrimp skewers were huge and their ribs were absolutely finger-lickin' good with a fun presentation. It comes with crispy strips and a mini coal fired grill to cook the ribs, perfect for someone like me who eats slow and loves her food hot! I've never tried honey mustard with ribs but this dish came with a ramekin of specially made honey mustard, and wow its an explosion of flavors in your mouth. Juicy, tangy, sweet, smokey, goodness!   For our main entrees we had the pigeon and salmon. I ordered the pigeon to be cooked just as the chef recommends, and it came to me in tender slices. The drumsticks are my favorite part. Loved how this dish was served with farro, it's the perfect grain in substitution for rice and so much more exciting to see on your plate rather than the usual quinoa. The salmon was grilled just right, each piece flaked off effortlessly onto the fork, and served with crispy strips on top of a bed of creamy mash potatoes, livin for the texture these crispies add! We ended with creme brûlée as dessert, lined with true pure vanilla bean on the bottom of the dish, delicious! No disappointment here, although completely different concepts, I enjoyed Blue Ribbon grille in LV just as much as Blue Ribbon sushi in MIA!"}
{"text":"During our quick trip to Las Vegas we decided to try this spot for dinner. My husband got the fried chicken which looked like half of a chicken, fries and greens. He really enjoyed it. I had the salmon which was cooked perfectly. A little pricey but that was expected. Michael was our great server."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner here for the first night of EDC!! Michael was an amazing server. Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"My new Fried Chicken FAVORITE!  OK so my hubby and I came into the strip on Saturday night and had parked at Bally's (note: it's not free parking-we paid $7 for a few hours)  Anywhoo with no intention of going out to eat, we saw this shop on the way down the escalators and thought why not as we'd heard great thing about it from the Yelp Elite crew that went (I missed out)  And I'm so glad we did!   We weren't starving - so I ordered the 1 wing and hubby got the thigh or was it breast... whatever it was he loved it. Thick and juicy - lol!  I love love the seasoning and my wing was perfect and moist too!   With it I ordered the Moscato and Modelo 24oz can and we were set!   Food was FABULOUS! Service was SENSATIONAL!  Staff were spot on service and you weren't standing around guessing. They were all very cool!   Thank you! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Well executed, tasty comfort food in a casual atmosphere with genuinely friendly service. Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"Had thanksgiving dinner here and then came back again. It is comfort food, but extremely high quality and very tasty. Service was great and food was delicious. Most comfort food places use the cheapest ingredients to make cheap dishes... this place has traditional \"cheap\" dishes, but the ingredients are top quality and the final result is amazing. I enjoyed each visit and will for sure be back for more."}
{"text":"My husband and I saw this warm and inviting place and couldn't resist even though we'd actually made reservations at STK. Sorry STK. But this place was our kind of restaurant.  The staff was friendly and the food was AMAZING. The oysters looked like something out of a foodie magazine. So FRESH. And the custom made sauces were perfect. No need to add extra lemon or tabasco. I ordered the lobster and my husband ordered the New York strip. Both were cooked to perfection. I will be back. So glad to finally find a good restaurant in Las Vegas. It ain't easy. When you find a good one, you're lucky."}
{"text":"When checking into the hotel, we were told Blue Ribbon was the newest and really really good so figured we'd give it a try. *There is a dress code and we were in our swim wear but they let us dine in the bar area with full menu service. Perfect.   Ordered an appetizer and 2 entrees. A burger and lamb chops. Our waiter was very nice but after asking our entrees twice, he never came back. It was about 30 mins after we finished our appetizer that I decided to go find someone to see what was going on. I told was told they would go and find out then let us know. Another waiter came to us and asked if we were informed by the previous waiter that there is a longer wait for the lamb chops. We were not informed but regardless, would it really take 40 mins from when we ordered...? I've never heard of that from any other restaurant before. He told us it would be right out and so we waited a little longer.  Finally we just decided to ask if they can pack it to-go because we didn't expect it to take so long and we had to get back up to the room. Giving a couple stars since the waiters were nice and the food was actually pretty good. I just don't think they should have people waiting around. The kitchen should probably be more prepared."}
{"text":"Very good in summary. Service is downright superb (bar area is Blair). The food is good to very good and compared to years in past there seems to be a slight deficit. Lastly and important to me is the limited in selection and diminished quality wine list. Acknowledging this is Vegas and a substantial CA wine list is key the selection outside CA (cabs) is less than in the past. Worthy the compliment is the Spanish selection of wines. Very good quality and price points here."}
{"text":"Visited on day 2 while staying at the cosmopolitan.  After experiencing STK the night before, we had a much better time at Blue Ribbon. Note that we are in our late 30's and early 40's.   The ambiance in blue ribbon was very relaxing, with plenty of lighting and music at a volume where is was enjoyable but did not obstruct dinner table conversations. The table were appropriately separate so that you did not feel as if you were dinning with stranger next to you.   Menu was fantastic, nothing was overly seasoned, spicy or to confusing. We split the pork rib starter, entrees of hanger stake & duck with a side of shoe string fires. Everything came out as expected. Desert was chocolate chip bread pudding, ice cream& fudge- delicious and easily split.   Lastly the service was fantastic, drinks always full, warm bread, and dishes removed promptly.   When comparing to stk, we had a much better tasting & more relaxing dinner at blue ribbon."}
