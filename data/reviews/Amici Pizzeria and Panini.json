{"text":"Take it from the Italian guy in your group of friends - \"this place is jussa lika Nonna/Momma useda make.\" Seriously. 

This was my first trek into this plaza built just off of Rutherford, dead center between Weston Rd and Hwy 400. I took a tour around, noticed a few note worthy spots, but then a then out of the corner of my eye (or it was the force... yeah, the Italian Force... Jedi's take note) that drew me to the this little spot.

They advertised pizza, and my personal Italian Kryptonite - a hot table (Tavola Calda), in their window so I parked my vehicle at an obnoxious angle and raced in to see what treasures lay inside this cave of wonder!

Parmigianna, Pasta, Gnocchi, Pizza, Arranccini, and more and more and more - AHEM AHEM .. \"Let me clear my throat\"... UH-mazing. The smell alone made my mouth wet and my pants tighter (along the waist... along the waist).

I was all set on a thick slice of lasagna when I saw something I haven't seen in years - Spezzatino!!!! Spezzatino is like Irish stew... but with tomato sauce... and well, it's better. Plus with the weather taking a turn for the gloomy and bitter cold this was the perfect treat for the day. I ordered it with a side of grilled veggies which were also amazing ANDY because I can't eat from a hot table without having a rice ball (arranccini) I ordered one of those as well. 

The real kicker is how much the staff treated me like family. Once I began eating one of the cooks came over to ask how I was enjoying everything, when I said everything was delicious she beamed with pride and then asked me if I'd like some bread to go with my meal. I said yes which made her happier, to which she ask if I'd like it toasted with a little bit of olive oil. I laughed and said of course that would be lovely. 

So to recap, at this point I'm being fed like a king with a huge plate of Spezzatino, bread with olive oil, veggies and a rice ball. 

Everything was amazing. Fresh made with love. I'll be back here again soon 

Eatcrest out."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza. Really does taste home made. The sauce is just like my mamma makes. The sandwiches and panzarotti are also excellent."}
{"text":"A nice little gem at 400/Rutherford . Tricky to find but worth the effort. Homemade in every possible way. Pizza Calabrese is my favorite if you like spicy. Antipasto plate is so fresh .  Will satisfy any Nonno or Nonna."}
{"text":"I ended up coming here because Ricci's told me they couldn't take my order at quarter to 3 because they were closing their kitchen at 3 (New Year's). Ugh. So I tried to source a similar place nearby, and it brought me here. My GPS took me to the wrong plaza, and the lady on the phone was super nice and helpful.

What I liked most about this place was the service. It felt very homey, welcoming, and Italian. The whole place had a cozy feel to it. I ordered a prosciutto focaccia, and it was good. It was a decent size, too. I could only eat half of it at once. I would love to come back and try some of their other food, as well as their coffee."}
{"text":"Family night at Amici was great. This is a small family run business.  We started with an antipasto platter. The pizza was thin and well cooked.  With so many pizza places in the area this is one of the better ones.  They were very busy with there delivery. They also have a great walk in special for an extra large party size pizza from Tuesday  to Thursday 13.99"}
{"text":"Amici opened their doors to the public in early 2013. Located in a plaza at the intersection of Vellore Woods Blvd and Rutherford Rd (the plaza on the east side), it is tucked away in the back.

I only came to know this place from their signs on Vellore Woods, advertising a Party sized pizza for only $13.99 (Monday - Wednesdays). It is well worth the price and while a basic pizza (pepperoni, cheese) it is delicious.

The restaurant itself is small...can only hold about 10 people max., it is more of a take out or delivery place. They also do paninis, which I haven't yet tried...but will.

Had the pleasure of speaking to one of the owners last time I picked up a pizza and she was fantastic. Asked if I lived in the neighbourhood and how we found out about them. She asked for feedback about their pizza and was genuinely happy that we've been back.

Hopefully, they will do well as they are close to where I live and their pizza's are EXCELLENT !"}
{"text":"Tried this out of the way place, because of Yelp-reviews.  We were only people in restaurant the entire time. Server/a young lady needs practice to make it a pleasant experience. The food makes up for what she lacked.   Panzarotti was delicious. We tried meat with side of pasta combo plate, Veal Parmigianna & Penne Pasta, wow!  great.  
All the choices of sauces were good: traditional, Bolognese, arrabiata, ros√©, alla vodka, Alfredo.
 Prices affordable, wanna say \"cheap\" in a good sense.  We ate well for very little.
3 people for $55"}

{"text":"With a welcoming and cozy decor, and friendly service this mom and pop shop have the makings of a nice little pizzeria. 

The lasagna was decent but could have used a bit more sauce and would have been nice to have a meat option as I found it to be rather bland with just cheese and noodles. The pepperoni pizza I order for the kids came first and looked rather grease yay first glance, but didn't taste as oily as it looked. Another pizza. A choice of a friend was a bit better with prosciutto and vegetables was less greasy and the vegetables were crunchy. 

I found the sauce to be on the bland side and could use a bit more spice or something to add some flavor. I know my wife would love the thin crunchy crust. I would come back, but it wouldn't make the top of the list."}
{"text":"The penne pasta is fantastic and always fresh, just like Nonna makes it! The pizza is delicious and the staff is really friendly!  this is definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurant Vaughan.

...and ya you can see an actual Nona in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"I was a little worry when I saw my friend's Pepperoni Pizza looked a little dry and burnt. Should I be worry?!  

I guess I was lucky that both items I ordered were pretty good!

Riceball ($3.95) Meat, Peas, Mozzarella Cheese & Amici Sauce

Pizza AMICI ($12.95) prosciutto crudo, mushrooms, red onion, green peppers, bocconcini and amici sauce

Both items were CHEESY in a good delicious way. The pizza crust was really thin and the veggie was still crunchy and I love prosciutto!

Amici Sauce = Homemade Tomato Sauce is a little light but it went well with riceball.

Amici might not be the best pizza in the area but is decent and the staff here is friendly. A good option if you are in the area."}
