{"text":"I have been eating at Luigi's since before birth (my mom loves this stuff). The new location is nice, but I miss the coziness of the old place.  The food has been consistent through the transition, which happened a long while ago by the way. Also, I have read a few other reviews that said Luigi's has left but I talk with him every time I am in. Regardless this is a great family owned pizzeria and I recommend the calzone because it is generously stuffed with ricotta :)."}
{"text":"A great little place. Delicious and affordable Italian food. Great salads and pasta. Try the pizza rolls!"}
{"text":"Lots of memories from this place for me.  Their pizza may not be the best in the world but boy does it take me back to the 80's-90's and growing up in Pittsburgh.  I am slightly disappointed that they moved to a new location in Bellevue.  Their old one, while a bit dirty and run down, had quite the charm to it.  The new place looks too clean cut and it seems like they're trying to be something they're not, which is just a good old fashioned pizza joint."}
{"text":"Solid pick for Pizza in Bellevue. You can tell that the dough is fresh, sauce is homemade, classic pepperoni, and they don't skimp on cheese. There was also a nice spice blend mixed in that complemented it well. If you want a good standard pizza, order from here."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery from here. The soup was very good. I also would Recommend the specialty salad. I also was surprised at how quickly the order was delivered. It was delivered within a 1/2 an hour."}
{"text":"My wife and I LOVE this place. Decently affordable, our server is always great and very friendly, the food is delicious and it's a nice home-y atmosphere. The first time we went here, we told the server we were newlyweds and Luigi made us tiramisu and gave it to us for free! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So many pizzeria's in the burg..   how does one chose?  Reading reviews on yelp is a good start!  Pizza at Luigis's is no doubt one of the best in the burg.  We often order from work and orders are accurate and no kidding on-time.  I like the consistency of the cheese. Not many have thin crust and its my favorite!   Sicilian cut is also available.  Today I tried the cheesesteak and side of fries.  The fries are fresh cut and delicious!   The steak hoagie was delicious sand fresh.   Pizza slices are available which is rare!   Luigi's is also a restaurant to dine in.. going to try that one of these days and will update my review.  Luigi's never disappoints .. thank you for the good eatin.."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the North Boros.  I can't make a trip to the area without stopping at Luigi's.  When I was a kid, the man himself actually owned the place and made the pizza, but they've since moved to a new location under new ownership...but the pizza is still just as good.  I prefer the thin-crust, but the Sicilian is also excellent.  The fried zucchini is a favorite and the mozzarella sticks are great, too.  The calzones are tasty, but may cause a coronary-- if you expect more than a handful of spinach among cheese in the spinach calzone, you'll be disappointed.  Because it's Pittsburgh, the chicken salad comes with french fries.  I tend to opt for take-out, but there is also a mid-sized dining section."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza - although the mushrooms were from a can. But the crust , sauce and rest of toppings on the Sicilian pizza were delicious. Nice family friendly"}
{"text":"There aren't too many spots where I order the marinara sauce, but this is one. Light garlic, onions, and basil allow the tomatoes to be their awesome selves without overpowering.   Side salad is very generous made with fresh crisp iceberg, the way I like it. I'm not a fancy bag of greens kind of girl.  Pizza is good, if you like those little pepperoni that curl up when baked and give you a little cup of pepperoni goodness, this is the spot for you."}
{"text":"Luigi's pizza is amazing! The sicilian pizza takes me back to how my grandma used to make homemade pizza. I can't wait to go back - definitely worth the 45-minute trip there :)"}
{"text":"I was one of their first customers starting at the old location. I live further away now, but will stop anytime I am near as they quite simply have the BEST PIZZA period of anywhere I've been. I have referred many friends and family and they all say the same. The owners and staff are very friendly and caring people and treat you like family. The other food is good too, especially the wedding soup, although 95% of the time we get the great pizza. The dough, sauce and cheese are second to none."}
{"text":"Best all-meat pizza in the area.  Always done delivery, never eaten in the restaurant, so I can't speak to the dining experience."}
{"text":"Luigi's is everything I expected it to be.  A decent place to order an authentic looking and good- tasting pizza.  I usually prefer New York style and Luigi's offers it by the slice.  I also ordered lasagna off of their daily lunch menu .  I think there are at least 6 regularly featured menu items to choose from and a drink is included.  Luigi's has a large dining area or customers can choose to order at the take out counter if they choose."}
{"text":"If you were born in the 70s, Luigi's is in your blood.  Went to the original location for pizza and donkey kong after elementary school. First time to the current location.  Best pepperoni on a pizza anywhere!  No donkey kong now, but same great experience/pizza. Grazie Luigi for the hometown memories!"}
{"text":"Been eating this pizza for many years from the old location.  This was the first visit to the new dining room restaurant.  Great to see a large menu, but it is a PIZZERIA....so I ordered PIZZA. A small 4 cut with sausage and a side salad.  The salad was crisp, cold, and a generous size. The pizza....oh, that PIZZA....as good as I remember it as a kid.  Luigi's sausage pizza is AWESOME.  No lack of toppings on it either, this pizza is LOADED with sausage and the cheese is that gooey, yummy, FRESH mozzarella (and that mozzarella is on your salad if you order it that way). Not greasy like Mineo's in Squirrel Hill.  And not soggy either.  This is the best Sicilian pizza you will ever get...ANYWHERE!   Friendly waitress and just a very nice place to eat.  It's also BYOB if you wish."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Tuesday in order to pick up a to go pizza.  My fiance, a friend and I were trying pizza from three different places and Luigi's was one of them.  I have driven by Luigi's many times before and for some reason had never stopped in but that did allow it to come to mind whenever I was looking for a pizza place I had not yet tried in the Bellevue area.  Whenever I called to place my order I was told that my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes.  I arrived closer to 30 minutes later and was immediately confused whenever I walked into the restaurant.  You see there was a large dining room on the left that was full of people and I didn't immediately see the are where I would get my pizza from.  Finally after a few steps into the restaurant I noticed that the whole back area of the restaurant was where I needed to be and I made my way back there.  My pizza was ready for me and I quickly paid and was leaving whenever the cashier told me \"Stay out of trouble\".  I really hope that was a friendly sentiment and not one that was based upon my appearance or anything else.  The pizza itself had a medium thick crust with a bland sauce which is weird since I could see a ton of green herbs in it.  The cheese was just ok and nothing special while the pizza itself had a slightly sour taste to it which I did not enjoy.  Out of the three different pizzas we ate that night this one was overwhelmingly our least favorite which was evidenced by the fact that 3/4 of it was left after the evening.  The bottom line for me is that I will probably not head back to Luigi's in the future.  I just don't see myself making a trip to Luigi's between the weird experience (although not bad) that I had in the restaurant and the fact that there are much better pizza places nearby."}
{"text":"I have heard Luigi's was the best place in the area to get Pizza. Unfortunately, when I tried it the pizza was not good and we couldn't even finish the Pizza (and we love Pizza!). Needless to say it was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Luigis is the best of the best. Awesome, authentic pepperoni. I have eaten here for years. This place is a tradition in my family and it's still as good as they were 15 years ago. They recently remodeled and have a great menu selection. By far the best pizza in Bellevue and right up there with Fioris as the best in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"My wife and I had our first date at Luigis. After we got married we decided to go back with our kids and parents. Gina, the waitress, did everything and more to make our night special. This restaurant will always be one of favorites."}
{"text":"Recently I've found myself patronizing Bellevue a little more, namely because I've bought a house in the area, and have been checking out some of the mom and pops along the little strip of Mayberry RFD that is the quaint main street. Luigi's is one of those little mom and pops that offers standard basic Italian in a comfortable setting. It's a little kitchy, red-white-and-green, with Dino and Frankie tunes playing in the background.  I've stopped in on several occasions now for dinner, with various friends, and the food has been consistent...it's good...satisfying. Not over-the-top gourmet, or even in the remotest sense 'pretentious'. It's just a good ol' night out for some pasta or lasagna, with a side salad, garlic bread and conversation with your pals.  The portions are ample, the prices are reasonable, the flavors won't knock your socks off and make you think you've died and gone to Sicily, but they won't make you cringe at having given your money to a profiteering Chef Boyardee either. The service is decent, kind of point blank, not rude, nor over the top friendly.   The crowd can fluctuate between 'Oh my god, I'm surrounded by Hillbillies' to 'the local gathering at Mayberry', but that seems to be the norm for most places in da burgh.  I've not had the pizza, which apparently get raves, because frankly I only think of pizza as coming in a box to my front door when I'm too lazy to do any cooking at home. But I've had three or four of the pasta dishes, and they come in a generous portion, with a side salad and an order of garlic toast. They taste fine, fill you up, and don't break your bank.  And for a local neighborhood joint, that's exactly what I'd hope for. A place you can go to find a dependable and reasonable meal, on a semi-regular basis, in a comfortable setting, with no frills or pretense.   And that is exactly what Luigi's is."}
{"text":"This is a great spot in Bellevue for a quick and decent bite to eat.  It is extremely difficult to find good pizza in Bellevue, so Luigi's is my go-to if I'm in the market for a sit-down pizza.  I've never ordered pizza for delivery from them - for that, I go to Mandy's in West View. Will definitely eat there again while I live in the borough."}
{"text":"We always order out from here.  Love their pizza.   Calzones.   Hoagies.   Salads.  Wedding soup.   Meatballs.    Always very good"}
