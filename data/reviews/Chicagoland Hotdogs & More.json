{"text":"I've driven past a thousand times but just found this place on Yelp when hunting for an alternative spot to buy gyros.   I came in before another lady with a large order, but the two-person crew actually worked on both of our orders together and we left at the same time (i.e. I waited for her many hot dogs to be put together.)  Normally, I pick up lunch in the middle of a work day when I'm kind of in a hurry so, if you do come here, even if no one else is around or before you, please be prepared to wait a little longer than usual for your order.  The gyro was good. The meat was a bit dry but not greasy, and the pita was both crisp and soft. I liked it but I didn't love it. The tzatziki sauce was nice, with a hint of cucumber. It's creamier and firmer than I've had before but very nice. The fries were dusted with salt and maybe a hint of flavoring, very nice, also not too greasy.   I would say it's pricey for what it is, but I don't mind paying a family business a bit more for them to keep going strong.  The restaurant is a tight fit for wheelchair/power chair users. You will not have room to comfortably eat here, as the tables are booth like in a row. I'd recommend ordering to go."}
{"text":"Average at best for hot dog.  Sandwich I had was disgusting.  Girl at register was high."}
{"text":"Corn dogs are amazing.... So was the Kraut dog and Chicago dog..... Can't wait to go back to try the fries.... Yummmm!"}
{"text":"Worse food and services EVER.  The owner short changed us. He took our entertainment book coupon but did not make the deduction. When asked about it he said ge did but could NOT show proof it was done.   I'll never go there again.  I have no idea what part of Chicago he is from but it's not from the same part I'm from. The food was trash. The gyro was gross, no tomatoes, no onions like really? Where did they get the meat from? It was tasteless.   Ordered: chilli cheese fries, gyro, Italian beef, Chicago style hot dog and a float.  Nothing was good. Threw it away."}
{"text":"I debated over giving 2 stars...  My family and I have gone 4 times to this restaurant...  The first 2 times the Italian Beef was incredible...seasoned well and yummy...  So we keep going back expecting the same experience....  SADLY the last 2 times we've been in the sandwich was blah and very disappointing. Not to mention the place was GROSS AND DIRTY!   My family and I were the only customers in there with 3 employees on staff and the tables were nasty, the garbage can was covered in ketchup, trash on floor, soda on the floor, etc. One employee was sitting at the back table on her phone (jeez)! Young lady if I were your manager you would all be put on a probation period! Not acceptable...HOWEVER my husband really wanted a sandwich and told me to hush...  Long of the short...My young girls wanted a pizza from Geno's next door so we decided to get our food and sit at another restaurant. Blah blah blah I ate 1/2 my sandwich and stole a piece of pizza from my girls :)   Ps, I really don't like giving bad reviews but I hope the owner sees this and takes note. That's what my husband suggested...I would like to see this place do better..."}
{"text":"I tried Chicago land last night and I must say The cheezy beef is amazing. Served with a generous portion of fries and au jus for the sandwich. Awesome place I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Been going here for ages.  Always good dogs but the place is in dire need of a good cleaning and paint  job. I'd bring guests to Portillos even if a little more of a drive for better atmosphere. ."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!! Has a great Italian beef sandwich and an awesome pizza burger! Their chili dog is so good and their frys are the best frys I've probably ever had. Their service is great! I recommend u go there!"}
{"text":"I'd give it about a 4.5, but I like rounding up for local businesses!  The owner has been in there every time I've shown up, and the food comes out hot.  The prices are spot on what you'd expect to pay, and so is the quality.  I'm not from Chicago, and have only been there a couple times, so I wouldn't be able to speak to its authenticity - but I can speak to its taste and the great customer service the crew provides every time.  If you're in the neighborhood and thinking about a hot dog, burger, fried zuccini, italian beef sandwich, or chicken burger, skip Sonic and DQ - they can't touch this place with a 15-yard drive-thru window."}
{"text":"I expected better. I'm a big fan of hot dogs so I was excited when I noticed this place was specifically for hot dogs. I ordered two different hot dogs and also tried a third one that my Dad had ordered. All three of them were nothing special and average. I don't want a hot dog my grandma would hand me if I stopped by her house on a visit, that's what I got. Staff was courteous and service was prompt. I get better dogs at Costco. Nothing special here don't even waste your money."}
{"text":"Love eating here. My boyfriend and I eat here at least every other Saturday. He loves the Chicago dogs and I get the cheese dogs! The cheese fries are yummy. It's small but there is additional seating outside and they also do to go. The staff is always super friendly. A great family owned business!"}
{"text":"My hot dog was just room temperature.  I talked to them about it and they just argued with me.  Initially I thought maybe their equipment was not working, since the hot dogs ordered by another couple in our group were cold.  But I think the problem was that they fixed my hot dog, put it somewhere while they started the fries.  I am not sure where they put it but it sat there while the fries were cooking.  I probably will never go back here."}
{"text":"We come here all the time. Friendly family atmosphere. Yummy food. Gota get some cheese fries."}
{"text":"My wife likes their gyros. The pizza puffs are pretty good too. But there best dishes are the chili cheese fries and a chili cheese dog. It's a pretty popular place and can get pretty busy."}
{"text":"Gyros are amazing. Best this side of town. Fried Zucchini is also a must have. Great family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"I'll have to admit that most of my favorite foods actually come from the few years that I lived in   New York. It's no secret that there is an on going battle between who makes the better food, New York City or Chicago? I have had my fair share of \"New York style\" hotdogs, and still wish that there was a legit New York style hotdog stand somewhere in the valley. Having said that, I have to admit that I may have become adopted to the Chicago style dog.  Chicagoland Hotdogs & More are the people to attribute to my conversion. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience there. The only difficult thing was to pick what I wanted from their huge menu. I was told about it by a friend and he suggested that I get a Chicago-dog my first time around. Needless to say I took the advice and got two, and my favorite side dish, onion rings.  As I waited I noticed that they had Chicago stuff everywhere; Cubs, White Sox, Bulls, you name it they had it. Even down to a detailed map of the city. However they did have the Yankees game up on the TV, so now I didn't feel like I was betraying New York to bad.  My order was done sooner then I thought, and there it was in front of me my first chicago-dog. It had a vienna beef hotdog, mustard, tomato slices, a pickle, hot peppers, a special relish, onion, and some really good seasoning salt. This was no normal dog, because this thing was loaded. At first I thought that most of those toppings contradicted each other, but as I took my first bite, my New York bias was humbled. It was out of this world. Both of them. I don't know what kind of seasoning salt they used on this but it complimented the veggies perfectly.  The onion rings were awesome as well. I say that, because the onion didn't all come out in your first bite, which is my biggest pet peeve when it comes to onion rings. The breading they used seemed to be a  perfect amount for how much onion there was. One of the employees realized as I was eating them that I was not using any ranch because they neglected to give it to me. That would have made me angry had I known what I was missing. They must make their own ranch because it was hands down the best dipping ranch I have ever had.  I'd recommend this \"mom and pop store\" to anyone, especially if you like hotdogs. I am sure that I'm going to be one of their regulars."}
{"text":"Exactly what I expect from a place like this. Fair prices and good food selections for a hotdog and sandwich joint. Great place."}
{"text":"The best taste by far is a plain grilled 'fire dog' on a soft poppy seed bun.  Just zippy enough without a lot of stuff added.  I have to limit myself to once a week on my diet, but it's always a treat."}
{"text":"Anyone from Chicago can appreciate Chicagoland Hotdogs & more. The classic hot dogs/jumbo dogs, Italian beef, and cheese fries will make you feel like you're right back at home in the Midwest. I also love that soda is still considered 'pop' and the walls are covered in Chicago sports memorabilia."}
{"text":"We  were way out in east Mesa and hungry not too many places to choose from so we decided to come here. Being from Chicago it's very hard to find decent Chicago style food.Great hot dog and pizza puff. Fast service. Very clean.   The only bad thing about eating Chicago style food in Arizona is that it's always a little bit overpriced but kind of have to expect that. If we are ever out in east Mesa again we will definitely stop here. Perfect place to grab food when you're about to hit the river or after"}
{"text":"The best Chicago style dog in AZ. Try the fried zucchini or mushrooms on the side. I always get good service for a hot dog place."}
{"text":"I have ate here my 3rd and final time. I just wanted to believe things would get better, NOT!!! Way over priced even if the food was good which it was NOT! If I'm going to pay like $5.00 bucks for a hot dog the dammed thing better be great, but every time they sucked. We had burgers 3 times also and they were dry as dirt! & $9.00 with frys If your going to charge $9.00 bucks for a burger don't use frozen meat and cook it till it feels like a brick. I can't say enough bad things about the place every time I've been there it was dirty as hell in front and behind the counter and the food really sucked. I hope you go out of business soon, loose everything you own in bankruptcy, have your wife cheat on you and your dog get hit by a car while finding out you have an incurable STD. Your food sucks almost as much as your wife at a family reunion."}
{"text":"Great Chicago Style Dogs and their Burgers are just as good, but those Fries are KILLER!  They serve em hot and they are crunchy on the outside and inside is almost hollow or has light potato \"filling\".  They are always very friendly and have so much to offer on the menu."}
{"text":"This is my \"Go To\" place for hot dogs. It's right around the corner, the Vienna Beef dogs are awesome! I've always had great service there and the food has always been delicious. Your opions close by (Sonic and DQ) are a notch below. Check the hours before you head over, I missed them by about an hour once... bummer!"}
{"text":"I love coming here! Being from Chicago,  I love to have a good Chicago dog every now and then. This hits  home!! The staff is friendly and the prices are average. A large fry is big enough to share between two  people."}
{"text":"This small family owned place not only has wonderful food, but a caring staff. Once you have been there you have to go back! It is addictive. They have great prices and everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"I cannot speak for the hotdogs, however the Italian beef sandwich is AMAZING.   The meat falls apart in your mouth.  If not for the bread you wouldn't have to chew. Will be back."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by at this place since it is right next to my work. First thing, I have to say that the customer service is great; they treat you like a priority. Their food is great, specially the burgers; though they sometimes don't cook it as \"Well done\" as I wanted to be. Anyways, I highly recommend this place if you are looking for cheap delicious food"}
{"text":"Authentic Chicago style sandwiches at reasonable prices.  Friendly and courteous staff."}
{"text":"Very good Chicago Dog.  Excellent zucchini fries.  The cheese fries were also pretty good.  Prices are reasonable and staff is friendly.  The place was clean and organized.  Definitely a good place to go for a quick and easy lunch."}
{"text":"Being from the midwest I definitely came in skeptical, but this place definitely delivered. The italian beef combo was huge and flavorful. I also got a side of cheese fries which were also delicious, but can't really go wrong with those. I was also asked if I wanted extra juice on the side.....and I definitley needed that! Food was fresh and hot, and the guy at the counter talked to me about my beloved Michigan Wolverines due to my hat. Great service and great food, definitely profiled the taste of Chicago!"}
{"text":"I think I would give this restaurant a 3.5 star review. My first trip here in April, 2018 at lunch time.   Two TVs were playing sports and about 4 diners were seated. The dining area appeared clean and well maintained.  I ordered an Italian Beef, dipped with giardiniera. The food was served quickly and correctly prepared, I have no complaints whatsoever.  As a born-raised (3rd generation) resident of Cook County I've eaten a number of Italian Beef sandwiches in my life. I prefer the giardiniera that has an oil base. The advantage of that is the topping sticks together and to the sliced beef better. The one I had at this place in the time it took me to carry the sandwich from pick-up window to my table all the giardiniera had rolled off into the basket, I repeatedly tried to pick the pieces up to keep them on the sandwich but they wouldn't stay put. Suggestion: change the recipe of the giardiniera, respectfully suggested.  The guy at the register spoke oddly, incorporating the word 'today' into nearly every sentence he spoke to every customer at the register. He probably doesn't realize he's doing it but it sounds really weird and impossible to ignore with such a booming voice.  Like I said, my food was fine, so was the service and the price. I thought that in the recent past I've ordered the same sandwich at Higley Hotdog Hut and it was better, perhaps not enough to justify driving all the way down to Williams Field Road but theirs is better, more like real Chicago.  And one thing I found very interesting about this place is you can order bulk quantities of traditional Chicago Dog ingredients from this restaurant. They have small forms at the register and also a price list on their web page."}
{"text":"Had always seen this place while traveling the east valley for work and decided to finally give it a go.  It was about 230pm on a Friday afternoon.  Ordered myself a chili cheese dog.  The hot dog was great, Vienna Beef does give it a superior flavor and texture, bonus that it was in a natural casing.  However, that's about where the good experienced ended.  Everything that surrounded the hot dog quickly took away from the excitement and enjoyment of my lunch.  The chili was kind of flavorless and a little thin, which is why, I think, they drowned it in cheese.  I'm all about a messy dog... but it was all over the place, so much so, I had to eat it with a knife and fork. (it's a hot dog, not a stew)  But after eating the dog and then tackling the bun, I figured why they were so liberal with their cheese and thin chili, the bottom of the bun was hard.  I know I came in after the lunch rush, but a hard bun?  Really? That's the cheapest part of the package other than condiments, easy to toss without taking it on the chin.  Either they don't care or someone left the bag open after lunch and I got the tail end of the bag.  Not unforgiveable, but when you add it all up, it was disappointing.    I wouldn't not recommend it, but it's not a place I'd drive out of the way for.  But location wise, I don't think they intend on catering to the hot dog enthusiast as much as the kids from Red Mountain HS down the road.  Service was good, the place is what you expect from a strip restaurant and its clean."}
{"text":"I absolutely love there hot dogs and also there cheese fries ant there service is great. And love the look of the place"}
{"text":"Poor service, poor Chicago style food. I ordered a sandwich for my girlfriend and got her an Italian beef sandwich with marinara and mozzarella cheese on it. I explained specifically to put the cheese on-top of the marinara. I get home and she opens her sandwich and there is marinara all over the place (because the cheese was not melted over the marinara) I call the place to let them know and she explains it was a mistake that won't happen again the next time we go in. Cashier rude btw and interrupting when originally placed the order. I was expecting them to fix it and no fix. Sandwich disgusting and soggy. Literally had to take everything out and remake the sandwich. Luckily I had marinara and mozzarella on hand. Not going back. The place used to be awesome when it was owned by Al and called 'Al's'"}
{"text":"Prices are rather steep for what you get and the \"combos\" should include drinks at the given price, but my wife and I had a generally good experience overall at Chicagoland Hotdogs and plan on coming back.   This small restaurant sits pinched in the middle of a small strip mall facing Power Rd.  I had passed by it for several months and always intended to stop, but it never came to mind when I was hungry.  That changed last weekend when my wife and I stopped in during lunch for a bite to eat.  It wasn't particularly busy, but business seemed steady and we were served quickly.  Most of the patrons we spoke with had a positive regard for the food.  We decided to try a Chicago-style dog and also gave the Italian Beef sandwich and house fries a go on the recommendation of the owner.   The hotdogs come in two sizes, regular and \"jumbo\".  Neither is particularly big, but the jumbo does set you back a dollar more.    The Chicago-style dog they put together was great.  Everything you could want, right down to the celery salt, sport peppers and poppy seed bun.  The Italian Beef sandwich, on the other hand, was just marinated beef with a slice of cheese on a bun.  It was rather dry and definitely seemed like it needed a sauce for dipping.  Although it tasted very good, neither my wife nor I felt like finishing the sandwich and agreed we would stick to the hotdogs next time.  The fries are your typical frozen spuds tossed into a fryer and were \"ok\", but certainly nothing to write home about.  If the \"combos\" included a drink at the same price, I'd feel better about making this a regular stop.  As it is, Chicagoland is definitely somewhere I'll come back to for the great hotdogs, but far less regularly than I'd like to given the current pricing.  If you're in the area and craving a hotdog, give Chicagoland a try!"}
{"text":"I have tried to like this place but I just don't. So why the two star? I guess the beef sandwhiches are great- but I can't eat them. However, I love corn dogs and zucchini! Here- the corn dog bites are undercooked (cool in middle) and zucchini is over breaded and cooked so long  that it's mushy inside! I have tried them a few times, with the same result. Just can't justify half and half anymore. Sorry."}
{"text":"Best Chicago style place in town. Even better than portillos.  Considering how all the fast food places have raised and raised their prices, youre better off coming here for real food even on a budget."}
{"text":"Great Chicago dogs. Fries are hot and crispy. Lots of Chicago stuff on the walls for the enthusiast. Prices are fair and the place is clean. Can't ask for more than that.   The gyros are okay. There are better places for that nearby. Stay in tune with the dogs.   Service is fast and friendly.   Support the little guy. Cheers."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Makes me miss the midwest with all the memorabilia.  Great service too."}
{"text":"Better experience the last couple of visits.  Good Chicago dogs at reasonable prices.  Will try the burgers next!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for a good sandwich so decided to give this place a second shot. Normally I go for the italian beef with hot peppers but decided to try half hot and half sweet. After selecting my sandwich wet of course (this is where they dip the meat and sometimes the whole sandwich itself into the pan of juices the meat was cooked in) I grabbed my food and headed home.  As I said before the service still needs some work but the food is still great. The only real issue I had this time was that what they call sweet peppers were nothing more than over cooked bell peppers. Now I understand that there are those who like everything bland, and under seasoned (yuck) but I am not one of them. Seriously do not go around calling something it is not. That would be like calling a dog a cat or a tiger a lion!   I mean come on a 2 year old knows the difference between the cow that goes moo and the chicken that goes cluck. So why do places act like we do not? LOL OK so enough of my ranting. Look bottom line the sandwiches are still great, their large fries are really large, and the prices are fair. Just avoid the crabby service and non sweet peppers and you should be fine."}
{"text":"Great Authentic Chicago Eatery in NE Mesa.  This place is certainly busy at lunch and understandably so.  The service is friendly and prompt, even at peak times when the staff is running full tilt, they will still take the time to explain the menu or take a special request . . . and usually with a smile.    The layout of the place is not large and is long and narrow so you have to be a bit patient when it is busy with a line at the register and orders being picked up at the counter, but the tables usually empty fairly quickly.  There is a self serve drink fountain with refillable Pepsi products but it is placed on the counter right next to the register so it is a get in and get out affair.  The walls are filled with 80s & 90s memorabilia from the Greater Chicagoland Area and it is fun to take a step back in time to reminisce about some of the great talent that came from the heart of the midwest.  The prices are reasonable and the quality is on the better side of above average.  However on some of the menu items, such as the Italian Beef and Italian Sausage, the meat does not completely fill the bun and the bun can be a bit soggy (even when ordered \"dry\" with jus on the side).  Also, the sweet and hot peppers, although tasty, do not add much to help fill the substantially sized bread . . . we need a larger sausage or smaller bun here. But the fries are crisp and fresh, the Chili & Cheese Fries are nice and cheesy as well as tasty and the small size is a reasonable portion.  The sliders are certainly tasty and the ratio of meat, cheese and bun are spot on, but you will want to have more than one; lucky they offer a 3, 4 or 6 pack to feed your appetite. The Chicago dog has all the necessary ingredients and is a good rendition of a hot dog that can be found on the corner of Michigan Ave and Randolph Street.  But, you would be better off customizing you dog just as you like it as there are better menu choices offered such as the Chili Cheese dog, Hamburgers or Sliders - unless you just need that poppy seeded, celery salted, sport peppered, tomato and onion topped Vienna Beef frank to quell that craving of a Chicago street corner meal on the go.  All in all, Chicagoland Hotdogs & More does a good job, especially on the \"More\" part.  It is worth a stop if you are in the area and will surely please most any American palate.

{"text":"Great food, great owner and the service is excellent! I enjoy the chicken alpine on pita and the rotale!"}
{"text":"Randomly stopped at this hotdog place because we were driving by and hungry... I got just a plain chili dog and WOW was it good! On top of that the employees were super friendly. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"A good Chicago restaurant. Italian beef, dogs, fries... It's all good. This is the sort of place you can depend on to get the food the way you remember it."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian beef. Very reminiscent of one of the many places I used to love in Chicago. Looking forward to try some of the other menu items, but definitely a good find if you're looking for a worthy Italian beef. Be sure to dip it!"}
{"text":"Extremely small portions. Italian beef was very flavorless as was the giardinare. Chilli cheese fries not that great either. Chilli looked as if it had been sitting there for a while. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I have no idea what the folks are saying about poor service. I have always had fast and friendly service.  Anyway, the food is always good. I love the traditional Midwest Pork Tenderloin sandwich. It is very good. The hotdogs are awesome and I love their chili. The Italian Beef is one of my favorite things they serve. Our family has been here many times and all of us like it. We have never had anything we didn't like.  We like to support the small, non chain places and this is a good one!"}
{"text":"Decent place to get your grub on. Chicago dogs were meh. Fries were very good, but the show stoppers were the corn dogs! Yummy with a touch of sweetness in the batter. Brought me back to the county fair. The batter to dog ratio was perfect. 2 thumbs up. Way up.  Dropped a star. Drove over at 6pm and they were closed at 4pm. Wtf?. Booo. Post your correct hours."}
{"text":"Found this cute hotdog place while shopping.  It's fairly cheap for a meal, and the food tastes like good home-cooked American food.  Would recommend if you're looking for greasy lunch food, but not if you're looking for A+ quality food."}
{"text":"This place has outstanding hot dogs!   They are very proud to serve Vienna Beef as they have signage though out the place letting you know. The atmosphere is really neat. They have Chicago artifacts all over the place, the smell alone let's you know this place is authentic!   I wasn't feeling to terribly hungry, so I ordered the Jumbo Hot Dog and a medium drink. Very reasonably priced, and they do all the fixings for you, just like they would in Chicago at a hot dog stand. I had mustard, onions, cucumbers, pepper chines, salt, and pepper! Gosh...That was a delicious combination.   The Vienna Beef was amazingly moist with a great flavor! I can see why these guys are so proud to serve the Vienna Beef. Haha  I cannot wait to visit this spot again! I promised I would tell 7 people about how great my experience was here!"}

{"text":"Disappointed. The Chicago dog was not like any hot dog I've ever had in Chicago. Sure, all of the condiments were right, but the hot dog itself was more Hebrew National than Vienna beef.....just not the same. The fries were just ok. Service was great."}
{"text":"I really liked this place, good food and I'm stoked that it is right down the street from me! Can't wait to try the other foods"}
{"text":"This is May favorite Chicago hot dog in the valley. Love the interior of this place and the food is great! I would recommend this place to anybody in Mesa looking for a classic Chicago dog."}
{"text":"I ordered the jumbo Chicago dog last night. What I got was not a Vienna beef link, but rather a mixed white meat typical hot dog, and it was luke warm at best. The tomatoes were faded and wilting; not fresh. No pickle spear either, but that wasn't listed as a topping so I won't hold that against the preparation. There weren't any cucumbers though, and that's listed on the toppings. The bun wasn't steamed like a traditional Chi-style street dog either but that's more nuance. For the price, I'll be making the drive to Portillo's in Tempe & Scottsdale for Chicago dogs that are legit Vienna.   The Italian sausage was much better. Seasoned well and the bun was a true-to-form roll that Italian beef & combos would be served in at Al's in Chicago and similar type neighborhood establishments.   I hope to come back to check out the sub sandwiches and give a better rating. But the hot dog was definitely sub-par and a disappointment. This coming from a dyed in the wool, native Chicagoan."}
{"text":"This place is very tasty and the service is great too. Everything is fresh and delicious. Haven't had one bad thing. And their sliders are so yummy! Don't forget cheese fries. And if you like chili, you can't go wrong with the chili cheese dogs or fries. Definitely recommend stopping by. Two days in a row, no regrets! As an added bonus, rick is a Chevy guy!"}
{"text":"Hate to say this, but first and last time I'll be here. Menu said it was a Chicago style hot dog, what I got was a poor reproduction. Razor thin tomato slices, couldn't even taste the pickle wedge, actually the french fries were thicker than the pickle slice. Fries were okay. No gyros on the spit. Lots of Chicago memorabilia."}
{"text":"Ok, so it was obvious that the cashier girl behind the counter wanted to be somewhere else. Upon my order she did get a little bit nicer.   Now the food. I got the gyro which did have some nice flavor but seemed a little well done , kinda dry. The sauce however was there to act as its savior. I also got the Chicago dog , again just average. I got a small mozzarella stick which I'll never get again. Plain and simple they weren't any good. Your average frozen dunked in hot oil for a couple of minutes and served. Blah! It's funny what I think I enjoyed the most were the cheese fries, slightly salty , warm cheese sauce over the top child hood goodness. All in all , not bad it's worth a try but that's about it."}
{"text":"Over priced hotdogs the size of my pinky.  Nothing special, won't be back."}
{"text":"People are super friendly.  They make the food fresh when you order.  They make great dogs and burgers.  Good place to eat!"}
{"text":"You'll get the Chicago hot dog and fries experience you're expecting here. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place.  Service was horrible, food was not what to be expected for a Chicago Dog.  Basic hot dog, tiny piece of cucumber, tiny pickle, couldn't even find the best part of the celery salt, zucchini's were the basic frozen generic ones and super greasy.  On the website, you see crinkle cut fries which they do not serve. The whole dining experience was completely killed by 2 of the workers.  Instead of cleaning off many dirty tables (yes, place was dirty), they were yelling and screaming at each other in the back.  The female was cussing while screaming and the young man was yelling right back.  The only calm person was the one doing all the work making the food by himself.  Won't be going back unless it's for a trip to the doughnut shop next store!  That was the best doughnut ever!"}
{"text":"Little hot dog shop. Good hot dog variety for sure! A little pricey though but the foods filling."}
{"text":"There was nothing crazy awesome about this place. The vienna dog was over steamed as it had lost its color. The french fries were ok but the ketchup was room temperature at 1130! Yuck! I did like the decorations of the Chicago shirts on the walls and the Pepsi pop was top notch! The man next to me was raving about how good his polish sausage was so maybe go that way! The woman who rung up our order sucked and no one else was as friendly as most Chicago people are, kinda bummed about that!"}
{"text":"Vienna Beef FTW! Any hot dog place that proudly serves Vienna Beef is a hot dog place for me. After a lesson on the history of Vienna Beef from the boyfriend's iPhone, we were in the mood for some good Chicago-style hot dogs and since we were in the area (on the way back from a Cubs/White Sox spring training game), we stopped in. I used to live in this area and had been here several times when it was under a different name and it's still as delicious. It seems to me that they're still using the same good products.   We both got the \"hot dog and fries basket\" which was just as it sounds. Good hot dog, served with all the fixin's (or however you request): mustard, onions, relish, tomatoes, cucumber salt, and sport peppers. Nom.   Lots of sports memorabilia on the walls- great for looking around while you wait for you food to be cooked fresh to order."}
{"text":"I love hot dog's, but I admit I am not all that familiar with Chicago style dog's.  I tried a dog chicago style with a side of fries.  The hot dog was great, especially all the toppings.  The only downer was the fries.  They plain sucked.  On top of the pedestrian fries was the ketchup.  Seriously, is it too much to ask for some heinz.  I hate when restaurants go cheap and put the runny, watered down imitation ketchup in a red bottle.  By the way, some previous posts complained about the service.... I found it to be very pleasant.  The place was packed at lunch time and it had a great local vibe."}
{"text":"Loving care is taken with every.... Come on, its hot dogs. .. Really really good hot dogs! You will leave very full and yet, counting down till you can go there again.  Chicago dog is spot on.  I'm not lying, my best friend who's from Chicago says so! I am a fan of the messy chili dog.  5 napkins are required at least. Don't wear a suit when ya chow down on that bad boy!"}
{"text":"Always a favorite. Everything from the Chicago dogs to the Italian beef is just damn delicious! The cheese fries are covered in a wiz-like sauce, and to me just decadent. For us midwest transplants, it's nice to feel a little like being back home. Oh and don't forget the Green River soda!!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Service is great. Food is amazing and always something new to look at on the walls. My husband is from Chicago and this place is as close to home that he has found out here."}
{"text":"Yass. I used to live in Chicago and I have a deep fondness for the hotdog places there. I stood outside looking longingly at the menu hoping it was the same. The minute I walked in and the aromas hit my nose I knew it was the real thing. I ordered my usual and it did not disappoint!!  If you want a good, authentic Chicago meal, eat here. Like, yesterday. The owners are transplants and the walls are covered in memorabilia. It gave us something to browse while the food was being cooked."}
{"text":"The closest thing to a Chicago gyro. Great staff. All around I will continue to give them my business. Bryan always remembers who I am every time and knows what I want. (Hope I spelled the name right)"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time with the fam. Left very happy eager to return. I ordered two jumbo Chicago style. I should have ordered three ' bomb'. The fried zucchini was awesome. The zucchini was fresh tasting and the batter was not over powering. I got corn dogs for the kids. I ate half of one those and was surprised how yummy it was. This place is great and the atmosphere is nostalgic.  Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"AMAZING. Went here last night for the first time and wow is all I can say. There were 5 of us (including my 5 yr old) and we all ordered different things. Everyone was very happy. Chili and cheese tasted great on everything and the hotdogs were fabulous, could really taste the beefy flavor, not just cheap hotdogs. Will be going back here."}
{"text":"A Chicago hot dog place in Mesa not too far from where I live? I was excited when I noticed this place a couple weeks ago. Today I got a chance to go check them out and try their food.  I asked for a Polish Sausage \"Maxwell Street\" style and the poor young man had no clue what I was talking about! If you order a Polish in Chicago that is pretty much the only way they serve them! (grilled onions, mustard and sport peppers)  I was so eager to try the food here that I was literally walking in as they unlocked the front door at 11:00am!  But that also makes me question why my fries were served with a dark color to them. This usually means one of three things: they have been sitting under the heat lamp too long, they were reheated or the oil is old and dirty that they were cooked in. Since they had literally just opened for the day, everything should have been hot and fresh.  The Polish was excellent but again something that wasn't fresh ruined it for me! The bun. It was nice to see them serving a bun with poppy seeds, which is how most hot dog stands/restaurants serve the buns in Chicago. But my bun wasn't soft. It was kind of stale, not soft and slightly chewy.   It's the little details that ruined this visit for me. I am going to go back and try the Italian Beef and give the Polish another chance and hopefully everything will be fresh next time.  ** Disclaimer - I lived 33 years of my life in Chicago and have had 100s of hot dogs and Polish sausages from dozens of restaurants, hot dog stands, carts and food trucks. Not once did the fries ever look like this nor was the bun this stale. Please do my hometown proud and serve really good food!"}
{"text":"Our soccer team stopped in and the girl at the register  looked annoyed from the moment our group even walked in. All 7 of us! I know, I know, it's a HUMONGOUS group to have to help.  After ordering and paying I reminded her that I needed my cup for the fountain drink and she insisted that she gave me one. She kept repeating, \" She could have sworn she gave me my cup!\" So after spending what felt like an eternity trying to convince her I wasn't a thief she finally gave me a cup after rolling her eyes all the way to the back of head. My hopes was that maybe she found her soul back there but boy was I wrong because surprise, surprise! Guess who brought me my food with a sour face? This companies \"Ray of Sunshine\"! I got literally less than a hand full of lettuce with 4 pieces of chicken and a whole onion sliced in my salad! I enjoy some onions just as much as the next person but I kind of don't want it to be the main course. But who am I to complain because god forbid I inconvenience or disturb the princess behind the register again.  So after begging for my drink and eating my rabbit snack. I would probably never step foot in this place again. But hey that fountain drink sure was refreshing! Which is why you get the one star!"}
{"text":"I came in after getting a haircut a few doors down and had a great experience. Well, as good of an experience as one can have around a bunch of Cubs fans. Just kidding of course.   The hot dog I got came out quickly, tasted great. Had onions and peppers on it which were fresh and great compliments to the food. I hate using the word \"Dive\" when I talk about a food spot but this place kind of is just a hole in the wall spot but it is absolutely worth it for a great little lunch.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I love your guys food! But omg you need to deep clean your dinning room! It's gross! The high chairs look like they haven't been cleaned in years! I was so upset I had to put my little girl in it! Around the floor boards are caked with thick dirt! PLEASE clean your dinning room! Chairs ketchup bottles everything so I can keep eating here!"}
{"text":"My family and I recently ate here. I was able to tell immediately from the smell when I walked in that it was authentic Chicago-style food. Food was great. We had an Italian beef with cheddar cheese and cheese fries and pizza Puff and a bacon cheeseburger. Was so happy to find this place because there are a fraudulent restaurants to ever ties Chicago food but this is the real deal."}
{"text":"How can a hot dog place be this good?  Really, it seems silly, afterall its JUST a hot dog.  But the dog is cooked to perfection, the poppy seed bun is steamed just right and the toppings are spot on.  My son digs the sliced beef sandwich.  Now if only they were under 100 calories, lol!"}
{"text":"It smelled like Home as soon as I walked through the doors. I had an Italian beef and it was like ordering back home in Chicago. Definately going back. To Those Who Know How Serious This Is..... THEY HAVE PIZZA PUFFS!"}
{"text":"This place is THE place for Chicago food minus  pizza. My husband and I moved from the Chicago about 9 months ago and as soon as we walked in we both said it smelled like home! They have Vienna Beef hotdogs, pizza puffs, Jay's chips, Italian Beef, Polish sausages, even those \"Tamales\" they sell at all the Chicago joints. Definitely recommend it! The owner Richard is so friendly. He stopped by our table to make sure everything tasted good. We're most definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered up a chicago dog and fries.   I found it to be a tad heavy on the mustard and the bun was slightly stale (slightly...not a lot stale).  Tomatoes were sliced a little thin and maybe not quite as fresh as they could be.  Fries were fries.  Nothing special, but not bad either.  Having said the above, it was pretty good and worth a return trip.  Not a 4, but not a 3 either.  Call it 3.5."}
