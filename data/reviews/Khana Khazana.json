{"text":"Well I have to give that the ambience is awesome as per the previous review. But that is it. Full stop. When it comes to flavor isn't in par with other restaurants offering the same dishes. The cook is East Indian but as per owner ( who are not East Indians) is relatively new with them. The owner doesn't seem to know or have a clue of what the actual flavor should be as she kept asking for feedback or what we think can improve the dish. I wish she would have tasted what the dishes with the same name taste like at some other restaurants serving the dishes. Or better yet kept dishes she is familiar with Mediterranean. I wondered why the location was empty for a Friday evening as most restaurants are at least fairly busy on that day but then thought a new location usually has those challenges till people are aware about the business. But after tasting the  food I knew the reason for an empty restaurant. Lamb was undercooked in a biryani and tough. I do believe there are better out there than this at similar price point. The owner is polite true, but her expecting customers back is good but not when the customers have to tell you what is lacking in each and every dish and pay for it as a the owners learning curve."}
{"text":"Walked in to a clean and hygenic environment. Ambience not over done. No back ground music though and not apealing. Server looked like a beginner, i ordered a deink, it came out wrong after letting him know i get. Response that \"are you sure\" is that what u ordered?? Food was ok felt like some trainee chef is cooking. Could do better  with some more practise. Naan was good though"}
{"text":"Greeted by the owner and was surrounded by lovely warm decor. We tried the chicken bryani and lamb korma.  Was flavorful and delicious. Lost a star due to the meats being a little cold on the inside. Made me think they do a lot of prep before hand and warm up. Be nice if it were all made fresh. Overall though, the food was authentic and I would for sure come back again."}
