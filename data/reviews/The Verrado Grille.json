{"text":"Verrado grille has amazing fish tacos and we always sit out on the patio with an amazing view of the Golf Course! The service has always been very good and the prices are reasonable especially for being on the Golf course! The inside dining area is very nice as well with a great Bar area. There are Tvs so you can watch sports as well."}
{"text":"Situated on the Raven Golf Course in the Verrado community of Buckeye is the Verrado Grille. Great indoor ambiance and west facing views of the sunset over the golf course from the patio give the Verrado Grille an extra star in my book. Because of its location near Buckeye, I'm giving it the extra star just because there are absolutely no good restaurants for a nice lunch or dinner anywhere around here. I've had pretty good food here, but with a little extra care in preparation, the food might deserve another star.

I have to disagree with the other Yelp reviews about the drinks. I was served the worst Margarita in the history of the modern world here. I quickly sent it back and overheard the female bartender remark to the server that there was nothing wrong with it....unless you like a glass of sickening sweet, warm, mixer, three ice cubes and with the tequila bottle quickly waved over the top. It may just be a matter of who's behind the bar.

Service is decent, but again, it depends on who you get. Several servers seem to know the menu, one could not tell us what came with the prime rib that night. 

Overall, I'll still stick with my 4 stars because this is such a breath of fresh air way out here on the dark side of the moon;  good food, decent service and great ambiance."}
{"text":"Gorgeous view, especially at sunset! Sat outside on the patio the first visit and enjoyed the pork chop special, which was quite good. Hot fudge sundae for dessert wasn't anything special. Next visit we brought the kids along and sat outside again. Kids meals were large portions and the kids loved them. My husband had the fish and chips which was alright, but not great; and I had the chicken Caesar salad, which was tasty, but not as large of a portion as I would expect for the price. Overall, we come here for the ambiance and expect average food."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship
With this place. I love the eclectic menu, waitresses are nice enough and view is beautiful. I guess it's just the blasé manner of the hostess and her misinformation. \"No, they don't take reservations\", I was told 30 min before our arrival at 11:30am on Sunday morning. Also, the dining room was still closed because they hadn't finished cleaning up the dining room from the previous evening wedding. Huh, why not...!
Anyway, the same hostess then told us upon our arrival that they do take res and now they were full yet they were wide open 30 min before.
Finally, the place is always freezing so we ate quickly and left. Maybe, that's there modus operandi."}
{"text":"This our first time out here in Buckeye Arizona,The food here was Amazing. Our family tried each other's food,from the Seafood pasta,Burgers,Fish & Chips......to some up all the food in one word \"AMAZING\"!! And the price even better."}
{"text":"Verrado Grille has stepped it up a notch! Good Food, Good Service, great location! I have always had very good food here.  We moved to Verrado late summer and enjoy eating here!"}
{"text":"Verrado Grille is wonderful! My family and I go here every single Friday for happy hour and dinner, and have never been the least bit disappointed. The service is great, the food is delicious, the drinks are tasty, and the views are breathtaking. Even if you can't get a table outside, the inside of the restaurant is just as gorgeous, comfortable, and lush; I suggest sitting in the bar area if you are going to sit inside! :)"}
{"text":"As an avid user of Yelp over the years for restaurants and other venues, my experience this past weekend at the Verrado grille has pushed me to write my first review.
I am a semi retired businessman from Los Angeles. My girlfriend and I were here visiting my daughter and her family who have been Verrado residents for the past 7 years.
We have enjoyed the grille numerous times over the years and as a matter of fact held my daughters wedding rehearsal dinner there a few years back.
This past weekend we decided to try the grill for brunch.  It was a beautiful day and decided to sit at an outside table.
Our group included an ESA (emotional support animal).  Even though Lola is an ESA dog, we still understand that some people may have issues with dogs, so we never insist on sitting inside or where some people might be offended.
We chose a table was way out on the patio with only one other table that was seated at the time way on the other side.
After our waiter took out drink orders we we were approached by a woman who asked if Lola was an ADA dog, I replied that she is an ESA Dog.
She said that they do not allow ESA dogs on their property and only ADA animals were allowed. 
When I asked why, she said (with a very matter of fact attitude) \"it has to do with food being served\"...and that it was their \"corporate policy\". Whether that be the law or not is for another day...as It is, illegal to ask!  I can tell you that this is the first time we have had to leave a restaurant because of being refused service with Lola.
I think the most disturbing part of the experience was the attitude of the asst. manger, a Ms. Fields, who almost seemed to get some pleasure out of chalking up another victory for her and the ousting of another ESA animal!!! As she followed us out the front door as though we were being run out of town!
We proceeded to go over to Tempo where we had a nice breakfast and where  \"All\" dogs are welcome.
Here is my advice to the Corporate office...They need to get involved and work on a complete attitude overhaul at the Grille and pro Shop.  There is a sort of arrogance throughout!
I think they are in for an awaking!  As of next week, they are not going to be the only game in town...with the opening of The Vic/Victory Club 
who as a matter of fact, mention in their literature to bring your Dog...Service animal or not!
The grille at Verrado may survive...but will never flourish especially with management like Ms. Fields!
Hope to return again after things change!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently visited this beautiful restaurant and were greeted by the manager,Robin. She was well mannered, professional and helpful. I explained my difficulty with certain foods and she was more than accomodating to meet with my needs. 
Im shocked to see the unpleasant comments about her, I disagree, the customer is NOT always right, why should they be. If a large party turn up without reservations, they should settle for what is available and not what they demand. People love to moan, complain and make life difficult, nag, nag, nag....

Our food was very good, well presented and good value as was the service. I would recommend this restaurant to anybody except complainers....
Thank you."}
{"text":"Service is not great and the food has been going downhill. Also there aren't many gluten free friendly options. We used to love coming for breakfast but then finally were told the breakfast potatoes are actually fried with flour. As a verrado resident I hope they turn it around."}
{"text":"Love the Verrado Grille !  Enjoyed dining on the Patio where the fireplace adds such a warm touch at Sunset. Food was really good. I'm trying to convince my son and his fiancé that they should hold their wedding reception here !"}
{"text":"Great views, below average food, poor service. As others have said, perfect for a drink on the patio but that's about it."}
{"text":"we were a party of 5. ordered 3 ribeyes, glazed pork chop.glazed salmon,chicken pasta. Ribeyes were so thin and $$ were the same for the ones we had 2 years ago that were thicker and cooked much better. I am not to sure whats going on in Verrado grille but they need to get better cuts of steak. We usually eat the bar menu and get drinks but this time we had out of town guests and sat with a regular guest that frequents VG every other day, How embarrassing when the 3 ribeyes came out well done and so thin it looked like 1 was cut into 2. I am so sorry that we took these guests to the grille tonight(friday Sept 14) Our server was excellent but food took so long to get to table it was luke warm at best. It's a shame that DMB doesn't set the standards they used to. The main dining room was closed due to a Bridal Event for promotion of Verrado Grille, but I must add I kept a watch on the event and thought they could have taken up less space and worked the patrons in the main room instead of stuffing the guests i the bar area.The manager on duty once again the same one that's been there on previous visits seems not aware of the wait times of food or the quality that comes out of the kitchen. Verrado Grille when the West Valley grows you will not be able to keep up unless you up your standards and sanitation."}
{"text":"Oh what can one say negative about the view.. Beautiful. The Food and the Service... I can honestly say this. 
1. The Hostess .. This poor girl had absolutely no clue how to manage the clientele. She was rude.. She obviously does not like her job. She was unpleasant and dressed inappropriate for a supposed Upper Cut Golf Community Restaurant. Bad first impression and forget being settled in an appropriate table for the # of members of the party. Upon leaving.. The clique.. Don't let the door hit you in the a** crossed my mind. 
2. The Servers... Honey.. You couldn't earn a living working the lowest of the low Greasy Spoons. Been awhile since I have had that low standard of service. 
3. The Food.. Fish was actually good. The Slaw was flavorless. The Salmon Burger... Forget this! Catfood would taste better!!! Had to send plate back because the portion of fries was must likely dropped someplace between Kitchen and Table.. House Salad did not arrive as ordered.. Food Runner brought a wilted Caesar Salad to table. 
4. Bar Service.. Bring your own!!! One Bartender for a busy Dinner Crowd.. Timed out 25 minutes for first drink order!!! Second drink order came after food had been delivered and nearly finished with Dinner. 
5. At No Time was Management present.. And here lies the problem ... 

As a Verrado Resident I am sad that this beautiful place can not provide a better place to dine. I am so embarrassed and will rethink bringing guests again."}
{"text":"This restaurant has good food and an amazing atmosphere but be prepared to wait!! We've eaten here at least 3 times and each time the meal takes an entire evening. I'm not sure how well the kitchen is staffed. Also, we love dining on the outdoor patio. We had to leave because smoking is allowed outdoors. I didn't want to smell that during our meal. Especially my four kids. This happened when there was a wedding reception taking place. It must have been one of their guests. So avoid this place when there is a reception!"}
{"text":"LONGTIME Grille regulars... What happened this past weekend, can not go unmentioned because it was such bad customer service.  I know it is hard sometimes, and even when your in a bad mood, you just have to push through and make your customers feel welcome.  This Friday night, invited to a birthday party up at the Grille. We arrived, sitting at a large table outside, with more people coming... And the manager, Robin, came out and started YELLING, I mean YELLING at our entire party for moving tables. Not only was I embarrased for my hostess, but I was embarrassed for the manager.  My friends spend thousands of dollars every year up there.  We love the atmosphere, the food is good, and love listening to Rusty, But to be yelled at like that was humiliating!  Our hostess decided right then and there to move our party to Tempo Bistro, down the street, who not only welcomed us, but treated our party fantastic and we all agreed that they appreciated our buisness.  I am afraid that if this on going problem is not fixed, The Grille, who I would think would depend on the Verrado regulars, will have a hard time surviiving."}
{"text":"Trish the bartender on Sunday makes the best Mai Tai plus happy hour all day on Sunday."}
{"text":"Another visit and once again Verrado Grille was nice enough to cater to my gluten-free problem. I got the hummus dip and was able to replace the pita bread with a variety of veggies. I also got the potato skins baked instead of fried so i could eat those too (no cross-contamintion is hard to find still)!  Thanks again to everyone at Verrado Grille for being so accommodating!"}
{"text":"Relaxing atmosphere, good food, great service...enough said!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a (rare) date night here and loved it. Good food and delicious drinks. Our waitress was really sweet. It was a beautiful night out and we ended up taking our drinks and having a romantic walk along the golf course to a beautiful bridge that over looked the course. We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The Verrado Grille sits in the Raven Gold Course. The golf course is surrounded by a community with different styles of beautiful homes.
As my BF golfed, my mom and I enjoyed lunch on the patio of the restaurant. The views of the rolling greens, the small lake and the great temperature made it a wonderful part of the day.
We ordered and shared the Fish & Chips and the California BLT. The food was very good. The service was attentive.
It was nice spending quality time with mom, having conversation over good food and nice scenery."}
{"text":"So after walking out of The Vic.. came here it was packed (no wonder, Vic is a joke).. only to be told they were closing in an hour and there was no room for us... seriously... does no one want business? Not impressed..."}
{"text":"Lunch was very good!  Service was exceptional!  Wonderful atmosphere!  We had the  fish and chips and the Reuben!  We will be trying it for the Prime Rib dinner some Wed. evening or the live music dining on Friday nights.  This is a special place.  There is indoor and outdoor dining in an area that overlooks the pond!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time-especially if you have children! They will not seat you. We were given an approximate time of 20 minutes to wait from the hostess. We ended up waiting OVER 40 minutes and watched party after party come in and be seated before us! At the 40 minute mark, we were told they still had two other parties ( a party of 7 AND a party of 5!) to be seated before us. My son is hypoglycemic and they were more concerned with seating friends and regulars. We have NEVER had such horrible service (if you can call it that) anywhere!  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great back patio facing 18th green and surrounding mountains.  Food is getting better but the service has traditionally been poor.  The back patio could use some misters and TVs.  Good happy hour."}
{"text":"Sonny Petit makes the experience 5 Star! The food is always good, but Sonny's happy, sunny disposition makes it even better. He is on the ball, keeps the coffee/tea coming! Good job Sonny! Thanks for the excellent service!!"}
{"text":"I got the mushroom pasta and it was terrible, I couldn't even eat part of it and had to send it back. I was so put off I just waited for my party to finish and didn't order something else. The mushrooms were very bitter and didn't taste fresh to me at all, everyone in my group agreed. I tried other people's dishes and we weren't crazy about them either. The dining room is too big and very un-intimate. Won't be returning at all and based on other people's reviews it seems like the place to go for happy hour or they just never been to a nicer restaurant other than your bland chains like olive garden and red lobster..."}
{"text":"As long as I don't speak with the manager I have a good experience. 

Staff is always good and food is improving."}
{"text":"Appetizer was cold so they microwaved the calamari. Need I say more. My Rubin was very good and the service was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I LOVE the Verrado Grille for the amazing views and drinks!  However, what I do not love is some of the unfriendly staff..the manager especially.  I try to only go at times when I know she is not around.  If it weren't for that I would give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Very inconsistent service and quality. Upper management seems very entitled and not an interest in improving the guest experience."}
{"text":"Had the occasion to stop in for breakfast at The Verrado Grille, mainly because it was virtually the only place open on a Saturday morning. After a fairly lengthy motorcycle ride to get to Verrado we were pretty hungry and it was strange there seemed to be little in the area to recommend it.  So into the Grille we found ourselves looking for a bit of coffee and sustenance.

It took a few minutes for the hostess to wander inside to greet us but when she did she was friendly and got us right to a nice shady spot on the patio, which was pretty well populated. The view of the grounds and little pond is very nice and relaxing.  

We started out ordering some coffee ( only one of which arrived after having ordered it with our meal choices ). A nice young lady ( not our server ) brought mine out to us after we pointed out the omission.  As for the food, I opted for the Ultimate Breakfast Sandwich consisting of scrambled egg (fried egg is another option) topped with bacon and ham on a \"grilled southwestern torta\" with melted cheese and a side of fresh fruit.  While it was tasty, I can't really say it was memorable.  My buddy had the Verrado Omelet that included what looked to be diced breakfast potatoes straight out of a frozen bag. 

Overall, service was generally cordial but slow.  The surroundings are nice enough, but the food was very mediocre at best and frankly I found nothing to warrant a trip out again."}
{"text":"We almost gave up on this resturant. We kept on going back as we love the patio but the food was mediocre and the table service was just terrible. We decided that we would give it one more go after not been in 6 months. We were pleasantly suprised. We had a wonderful waiter named Sonny and our breakfast was delicious.  Sonny was very attentive and had a great postive energy. Everyone working there seems to be alot happier which will draw us back a lot more frequent."}
{"text":"In belated celebration of our friend's birthday (Happy Birthday, Chad!) four of us went to dinner at Verrado Grille. Living out in Estrella in Goodyear, it's so great when you can have such a lovely dining experience close to home.

We chose to sit in the bar, which allowed us to chit-chat with the bartender, Desi, as she prepared our drinks throughout the evening. If you like margaritas, go to Verrado Grille, ask for Desi, and request her \"tequila lover's margarita.\" It's unlike any other margarita I've had, with muddled lime, lemon and orange. It's strong but very good, and she refuses to give you a straw because it's meant to be sipped. Chad opted for a mojito instead, and it was really very good as well. There was so much mint in the mojito, the glass was almost completely green. 

To start we shared the spinach and artichoke dip, which was served with yummy chips that had a sweet/spicy seasoning on them. 

My entree was the herb-roasted chicken. The two chicken breasts were served with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans, plus an herbed chicken au jus that I didn't touch because the chicken was so flavorful, I never even thought about it. By the way, the chicken they use are all raised without hormones or antibiotics and are fed a vegetarian grain diet.

My friend, Cara, also had the herb-roasted chicken (she had also had it just 2 days before and loved it that much - that's how good it is!). Meanwhile, the men had St. Louis-style barbeque baby back ribs, which came with cole slaw and french fries. 

For dessert, the guys shared a cookie-dough cheesecake and Cara and I had the brownie berry parfait. Think brownie sundae but packed with fresh berries. Yum! 

We had a great meal, fabulous drinks, and we didn't have to drive for an hour!

And, if you have kids, they offer free babysitting on Thursday nights!"}
{"text":"Update: The staff has turned over and the experience is so much better!!!  I have been here a few times since my previous review and I am happy to report it's much much better. 
We have eaten here three times and all three times have had the same experience. Food is excellent in quality but the service is slow. DO NOT go here if you are in a hurry, want your drink refilled in a timely manner or get irritated quickly, this isn't the place for you. DO GO HERE for a great view, good food and you don't mind watching the waitress sit down on the patio to talk to a customer for 10 minutes when two of her tables asked for the check 20 minutes ago. They must not work off of tips is all I can conclude."}
{"text":"chef Robbie is a genius with food! best sweet and spicy wings & truffle fries ever!!! been coming to the grille since I was only 11 years old and have never stopped. most family
oriented place in verrado. my absolute favorite :)"}
{"text":"Amazing Burgers (get the Grille burger and add fried egg and bacon) and the BEST Chicken Wings I've ever had and I am from Western New York."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in on a whim and I was very reluctant to try a steak here as I am very picky about my steaks. I ordered their ribeye (medium rare +) and was amazed by the texture and flavor. It was by far the best steak that I have had in the whole West Valley. I highly recommend anyone to go here and try it!!!!"}
{"text":"We go here often. Nice patio area. The happy hour has some good choices. I have had also all the salads. Good on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"As my prior post gave the grille a very negative thumbs down I wanted to update my review.  Just before Christmas we booked a baby shower for my wife with 20 or so friends and relatives in the private dining room.      Now somewhat different than showing up in the regular dining room or patio area the private room is a small banquet type room.  We had our own waitress assigned to our group and she was absolutely wonderful.    She's a keeper and the first real pro we've had at the grille.  There were two other gentleman who assisted and they too were awesome.    The food was served timely and was very good.    My update on the grille is two fold.  1.) the banquet room is beautiful and perfect setting for private events.  2.) with the service, and quality of food we will be trying the grille again in the near future.   I'm not convinced the overall operation has changed but feel it's only fair to raise my score with our recent experience."}
{"text":"Came here for Thanksgiving Buffet.  It has been very good in the past, today it stank... literally.  As soon as you walked into the main serving area you were met with the smell of too old fish.  The other food was insipid and uninspired.  CLEARLY this was an attempt to make a bundle on mediocre ingredients.   Mashed potatoes, instead of fluffy white clouds of delight, pasty, yellow, dry yuck, as if they were made days ago with no particular effort in preservation for today.  Mac and Cheese...  nope...  just mac with stuff made to look like it might be cheese, CERTAINLY there was no cheese flavor...  AND it was dry as can be, awful is the word.  Oddly, the baked fish was, if not great, was at least not as bad as the rest of things, green bean quasi-cassarole, against tasteless and underdone.  I do have to give credit...  the Prime Rib, while not Durant's Prime Rib (this place used to have a Prime Rib Wednesday when their Prime was almost as good as Durant's) was at least properly done, and did not have strings in it.

I came at 2:15, there were all the appearances of being way overbooked.  I went back to try the fish and had to wait in a long line to find that the fish was nearly gone as was most of the other sides, the Mac and Cheese that was left, as stated before was dried out, and the sauce for the Ravioli (which was itself dried out) was completely gone.

This used to be (2007-2009) a wonderful place to come and eat, and their Thanksgiving Buffet was quite good in those happy yesteryears.  Looks like they have went the way of most rubber stamped restaurants these days and traded quality for mediocrity, or perhaps even less.  Sad for the masthead dining facility of this fine little community.  This meal ended up costing over $60 with a glass of wine and tip, I have had much better meals for half that."}
{"text":"I've tried this places several times and every time I'm always let down. There have been multiple times when my food was still cold, indicating that it is obviously not \"fresh\". Our server appeared and sounded very displeased the whole time. The manager had a very degrading tone when she talked and always looked really pissed off so I can't blame her. Don't get me wrong, the view is nice, but it is not worth the money or the unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Not a huge menu, but food is good and service is good as well. Great place to have a cocktail on the patio"}
{"text":"Last evening we joined our neighbors who were celebrating an anniversary. Our group of celebrants were 20. 

They decided to hold this get together at the Verrado Grille. This part of the country club in Verrado. It is a very nice looking building with lit palm trees so at night it makes a great statement. 

When we arrived we were greeted and shown to the party. As soon as we joined the group a wait person was asking what we wanted to drink. I believe we had three waiting on our group. They were quick and and never let us sit unattended. We spilled out on to the patio with a great view of the golf course. Once we decided it was dinner time we all gathered in the restaurant it self. It is a nice well appointed room with windows designed to allow a expanded view. 

Dinner was a choice of three items off of the menu, one steak, one chicken and one fish. I had the chicken. It was fine, nothing spectacular, but fine. Each seemed to enjoy their meal and the restaurant it self. 

We were well taken care of with no rushing or lack of service in a nice setting. I would use them for a gathering or just a nice dinner for two."}
{"text":"We frequent this restaurant and love the bartender, wait staff and food and spend a lot of money there. But tonight friday 7\18\14 we went and asked to be seated and the place was full and were deciding among ourselves to stay or not, the 2 hostesses continually stared at us and started laughing at us, as we were the only ones in the lobby...and hiding their faces and looking down like we didnt notice them laughing at us???  I could care less a couple immature teenagers found us adults not as cool as them, but this is a adult nice place, it isn't Chucky Cheeses or McDonald's...come on Varrado Grille, you might want to train customer service if you are going to hire kids ..   So we left and went downward street where we felt welcomed. You might want to hire more mature  hostesses!"}
{"text":"Decent food and a beautiful setting, but cocktails are not good and the service is very slow. I've been there quite a bit since we live in Verrado, and the drinks are always disappointing. Last time we were there our ticket was lost, so the food took twice as long as usual (which is always lengthy anyway). Could be fantastic but definitely has room for improvement."}
{"text":"Had breakfast at The Verrado Grille last Monday. The food was as very good, we split a breakfast plate as the portions are very good size. We sat on the patio close to the golf course, the view was great. Our server was Sunny, Sunny was great, he made suggestions on what to order, kept our coffee cups filled the whole time. Sunny was just amazing, he is surely an asset to The Verrado Grille. The food was great, the service was wonderful, I highly recommend this facility, hopefully you will get Sunny as your server...!"}
{"text":"Special needs Autistic child was harassed by the waitress at the bar. We live in Verrado for 10 years and eat here twice weekly to the point that they know what we like to order so we don't have to anymore. Well that was until today. We will never eat at this place again!!! My friends daughter is non verbal severely autistic, as you know they make different kind of sounds which is the only way she communicates.  We were three families eating here, Hispanics and one African American. The waitress and manager spoke to us and our children like we were below them. Our kids were yelled out to shut up across the bar.  Not once or twice but various times. Their response when we confronted the waitress and manager  about their behaviour , told us that we should.move the child between her parents. Hope they never need to know what it feels to have your child with special needs be treated like that on a Saturday at 1 pm. A scene was caused and we all walked out of it to never return. We will be filing a formal complain for discrimination.  In all honesty, those two people working there should be fired for treatibg an autistic child that way!"}
{"text":"Decent food, but service was terrible. Our server didn't ask what choices we wanted with our dishes, didn't try to upsell us any salads, and spent a total of 10 seconds at our table of 7 people after taking our orders. 

One of the orders was completely wrong (onion and mushroom burger, no cheese; came with no mushrooms or onions, but plenty of cheese) and when we sent it back with a clear explanation, it came back wrong again.

The waitress came back to refill water only once or twice throughout the course of the meal, and was quick to return to other tables (ones that didn't have an automatic 20% gratuity built in because they had fewer than 6 people). She was rude, uppity and clearly thought she had better things to do. 

Truly disappointing for a setting and building of this caliber. The view is outstanding, and out on the deck having drinks and eating stuffed olives would have earned Verrado Grille a 4 out of 5. Terrible service soured the entire experience.

UPDATE: 3/8/2011

I'm pleased to report that the exec. chef from the restaurant read my review and sent me a very nice note. It's a good sign when a chef holds himself accountable for the restaurant as a whole and doesn't make excuses, so I'm reasonably certain our bad experience was a fluke. Next time we eat at VG I'm hoping poor service won't detract from the food, and I can re-rate it higher."}
{"text":"This is a great little community and we loved this golf coarse grill. Nice ambiance and excellent service and the breakfast food some of the best we've ever had. I had their version of the skillet and it was perfect, DH had his standard bacon, eggs and added pancakes and it was all delicious. Definitely recommend this hidden gem."}
{"text":"I like the fish and chips here. This place seems relaxed and laid back. I have also gotten hamburgers here and they are good too. The atmosphere seems interesting as mostly only local verrado residents frequent this place, and it seems like they all know each other including the bar tender, host, and wait staff which seem to linger and talk to the customers.  I don't live in verrado so they don't know me but regardless if you are in the area take a break and grab some good food and beers at the verrado grill."}
{"text":"Always great food and service. A regular go to for us, especially with the evening sunsets on the patio. Can't bee this great local place in Verrado. Love our little corner of the West Valley!"}
{"text":"This is amazing place to eat....beautifully set off the golf green.  Wonderful service. Marvelous food. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"For the location and expectation, I was somewhat surprised. This appears to be a very high end community with what appears to be a very nice golf/dining facility. I'm not sure if the club has membership and just the restaurants are open to the public? But either way my perceptions were this:

The view from the patio is beautiful and overlooks 18 and the grand mountains that ascend the course to grace the skies. The service needs a little help and direction. They said that they were slammed (not) for the amount of people seated I could have handled all of the tables by myself quite easily.

#vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate #FNjim2017 

Our server started of by forgetting \"Philly the Kids\" coffee after our initial beverage order. Then, we finally got our food order in and it came. However, we did not have anything to eat it with. So, I went and got roll-ups off of another nearby table to facilitate consumption.

Philly's sandwich was \"Ok\". Nothing to write home about and my (Comelette), new name because it was a Hybrid between an Omelette and a Calzone, was hard to eat as all of the add on's for the Omelette fall out. I managed but it was weird. 

Given the setting, the servers should really be in nice shorts, belts and a golf polo with the course logo and white sneakers. Or, if you are going to leave them in black slacks, Van's really are not an upscale look and the black shirts from grandpa's closet need some help. It's funny but my friend and I both had the same take as this is a community trying to be upscale but needs direction in attaining it. Truly, two miles in any direction and you are in the heart of Arizona agriculture. It is like this place fell from the skies and landed here. We rode our motorcycles out here to check out what the Westside had to offer. Go North young man I say.

{"text":"Had to downgrade since my breakfast review back in 2014. One reason is the online menu is highly innacurate. Most selections have been deleted. Very important to keep the website updated. This may alleviate some disappointment once your customers drive 35 min one way with their hearts set on something. Very limited number of entrees. I noted a single steak offering of a Rib eye for 28 bux.  My Wife and I instead, had the Chicken Carbonara Pasta dish for 18 bux, it wasn't bad but the chicken wasn't trimmed real well so there were a few bites that couldn't be chewed. Prosciutto ham was nearly non existent.  Salad was additional, as was a cup of French Onion soup which was really good but didn't have the standard layer of cheese on top. No bread offered either. There is no where else to go in Verrado so therein may be the reason for the sides to cost additional. Have to keep the place running. Two entrees, a side salad a cup of soup and 2 drinks you are looking at $60+."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Verrado! Only visited once and can't wait to go back again to try something else. The house salad is large enough for a meal. I hear it's hit or miss with different cooks here, but on my visit the food was delicious. Service was fantastic, I wish I could remember his name. The menu has something for everyone, even vegetarian friendly which I can't say about the other two choices of eateries in Verrado."}
{"text":"I live in Verrado so have dined at the Grille many, many times. First of all, it is a gorgeous location and atmosphere. Whether eating indoors or on the outdoor patio facing the mountains, it's always a very comfortable atmosphere. Ambiance alone makes this a great place.

I am delighted to see a new item on their menu that is vegetarian -- it's a grilled veggie wrap and since i'm vegan, i just ordered it without the cheese, and unlike most vegetarian items that are tasteless without cheese, this sandwich was perfect. Very tasty non-dairy dressing. Two thumbs up to the Verrado Grille for adding this healthy and cruelty-free option to their menu. Now when my meat-eater friends and family dine there, I no longer have to decline. :) 

Also, the chocolate cake I had there was one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever had anywhere! 

Definitely worth the drive if you are outside of Verrado."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch after hiking  
Waitress was so unattentive 
We had the kitchen busboy bring us more water and tea.  The  food all tasted like it was cooked in to same deep fry grease basket.  The waitress looked like she hasn't. Showered for days.  I'm shocked an upscale area would allow someone to work like that"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice; once for lunch and once for dinner.  The food was excellent on each visit.  The waitstaff is friendly, the restaurant looks great, and the view is gorgeous.  You can eat indoors by the fire or outside on their patio overlooking the blue of the lake and the greens of the golf course. This is a great place to take out of town guests if you are interested in having them see the beauty of the AZ desert and having good food and atmosphere to go along with it! I'm very pleased with this establishment and I will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"The Verrado Grille is one of my favorite places to eat in the West Valley. Since it's close to home it is a top-five. Sitting outside by the lake is a beautiful ambience. There southwest wrap is delicious! My recommendation if you were going for the first time is to go during happy hour they have great discounts on drinks and starters!"}
{"text":"We are picky diners.. Found this place while traveling Palm Desert to Scottsdale. We will definitely be coming back.Great food and attentive service."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials.  Also the house salad is a fantastic bang for the buck!
My husband says they make the best bloody Mary's!"}
{"text":"The Verrado Grill is stunning and this is why I keep coming back, food is good too but Saturday night, I bellied up to the bar with my girlfriend, the restaurant was NOT busy one other couple sitting at the bar, we ordered our usual, Dirty Martini with 3 olives, the bartender (female)  puts a red wine glass in front of us and told us that she had no clean Martini glasses that it as a popular drink tonight.... Hmmmm I look around and not one person had a Martini....  Clearly she refused to wash a glass or two. To me that's just poor customer service, oh and to top it off, the second Martini we ordered we asked for blu stuffed olives and she charged us each $1.25 for the olives... REALLY?  Shaking my head... I will go back but not when this bartender working..."}
{"text":"I just indulged myself with Dinner for the first time at Verrado Grille last night, and I must say that it was a great experience under the circumstances. 

They close at 9 pm and we got there at about 8:30, so I was expecting poor service because of our timing. Our waitress was nice, and the service was still good for being almost closing time. 

I had a pint of Verrado Ale (which is 8th street from Four Peaks) and ordered the Almond Encrusted Basa, which was a beautifully cooked white fish with this delicious Orzo/Risotto side. 

The price is right about ball park for the level of quality you get, I would even pay up a little more for it. 

Overall it was a great experience and I would recommend that you aim for a sunset dinner, as the view over the golf coarse and the white tank mountains is amazing during that time."}
{"text":"Awesome place to have a nice dinner. Decided to check it out on a Sunday evening after church with my brother Jairo and his beautiful family. The place is beautiful so please bring your camera.  Service was great too with very friendly and attentive staff.  Ordered appetizers from the happy hour menu which were fairly priced. AppetiZers were surprisingly awesome. Menu offers good American selection at decent prizes.  Kids options are fantastic and definitely priced correctly.  Not the most affordable on the main courses but is worth it as food was good and the view was all worth it.  Will definitely be back. I would have given it 5 stars if they didn't charge for refills on fountain drinks and if they didn't charge me an extra $4 to split a meal with my wife."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times.  The view is great--especially if you can get a table outside.
The food isn't the best.  Each time I've been a little disappointed in my choices.  The pasta is very bland and tastes a little like that served in a cafeteria.  I got the sliders on recommendation and they were dry and charred.  
The bar area is nice and a decent place to meet friends."}
{"text":"Good food and a nice patio to hang out during Happy Hour. They have $3 and $3.50 beer specials and 6 appetizer specials during Happy Hour.  The new grilled cheese bites and phenomenal with a fantastic dipping sauce. The wings are great; I think it was 8 wings for $6.  The sliders and fries are excellent. Pretzel bites with beer cheese and street tacos are also good choices. The only thing we didn't care for is the spinach dip."}
{"text":"We ate lunch here today with a group of 12. Such a great experience. We sat outside and it was beautiful! The view and the weather proved Arizona's beauty and attraction! The food was great! We had everything from a hamburger, Mac and cheese, fish and chips and salmon at our table. Everyone loved it. The staff was helpful and constantly around giving us what we needed, but not pushy and let us have our space to enjoy each others company! What a great place and community!"}
{"text":"Took family here that was visiting as we'd heard the view was spectacular.  Yes, yes it was!  As we were dining the sun set and it was absolutely breathtaking.  We had a little trouble finding a comfy table because it was December and quite chilly in the evening.  Everyone else was using a heater but our patio table's heater wasn't on.  We looked around and found a similar table whose heater was on and after waiting quite some time for our server (or any staff to walk by for that matter) to return we took it upon ourselves to switch tables.  It was a relaxed atmosphere and fairly empty so we assumed they wouldn't mind.  He was a little annoyed with us and after that our service went drastically downhill.  He was extremely rude the rest of the evening.
Food was pretty good, typical golf course fare....the meatloaf was outstanding as well as the Mac n cheese.  I think we'd return for the views and I'd like to try their happy hour.
All in all, I'd rate it 5 stars for views and ambiance, 4 for food, 2-3 for service."}
{"text":"Last Saturday I had my first time experience at 
The Verrado Grille . It was a beautiful day and was
enjoying my lunch with my friend on the patio .
The hostess and waiters where very friendly to us and a family that arrived with a darling little girl and a sweet service dog at  table across the way from us . ( who were only other customers on the patio ..btw)
All was well until a very bossy manager ( I guess)
arrived at the table and caused quite a stir .
I can't imagine why these folks were scolded by Ms. Bossy pants .. Who then banished them because of their  well behaved) service dog ?
It's the law to allow dogs ESA  animals.. correct ?
The dog was wearing a vest and I saw them show the ID so why turn away biz ?
Looks like they could use some !!

I guess some people really need to abuse their power and I highly recommend this woman be excused .
Other than this bad experience ..
The food was great ."}
{"text":"Ordered their grilled burger. Asked for it to be well done. It came out medium rare. Didn't discover until after biting into it. Waitress never came back to check in and see why I haven't eaten my main entree. 

Place has potential, but unfortunately poor wait staff. Either didn't write down the order correctly or it didn't get cooked right. Either way, I won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 22nd anniversary at Verrado Grille last weekend. If you want a great atmosphere, then this is the place to go.  If you want good food, go somewhere else.  We ordered the spinach dip appetizer and it was really good.  For dinner my husband ordered the chicken carbonara.  It had a good creamy flavor, but was very salty.  I ordered chicken tenders, expecting nice juicy tenders.  It was more like what you get at Dairy Queen. I didn't even eat them. The manager Robin asked how everything was, so I told her I was disappointed.  I have eaten there in the past and the food was delicious, but today was very different.  I expected more than flat frozen chicken at a place like this and better drinks.  She only said, \"Oh, I'm sorry.\"  I also told her that I would not likely be back. She just said, \"Ok.\"  Not what I  call great management.  I was VERY disappointed."}
{"text":"The Verrado Grille provided delicious appetizers at very reasonable prices (happy hour) that met our expectations for a great restaurant experience.  Portion sizes were generous and everything was served hot.  I highly recommend the Grille."}
{"text":"Food was good and service was fine. HOWEVER, the live \"band\" they had playing tonight was a total nightmare. We were sitting in the main dining room for dinner and the band was in the same room. They had so many excruciatingly loud sound mishaps, everyone was cringing. Then the guy kept doing mic checks. So in between the two, it was a total diaster. I dont know where the manager was, but if that was my restaurant, I'd never allow my guests to endure that. We ate quick and got out of there as fast as we could. I did complain to a staff member, but it didn't seem to matter. If they're going to have live music, they need to hire a sound guy to handle the set up and equipment. Otherwise don't have that. I mean I've seen live music tons of times and I've never seen that many ongoing issues. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"The food at lunch was fantastic (honestly one of the best BBQ sauced burgers I've had!) and the location was beautiful but the service lacked a bit. 

Beautiful scenery and serene location. Cute little \"town\" (more of a strip of shops) but really nothing more."}
{"text":"Poor service and Food is way over priced.  I won't ever eat at this restaurant again.  Female bartender tried really hard to be nice.  She was a horrible actress.  Chicken breast was hard and dry and way too expensive.  Very disappointed.  Employees had more fun talking to each other than their customers.  Another customer was upset as she was being ignored along with me."}
{"text":"Late November...
The desert air, crisp and clean on a Sunday morning,
And I'm surrounded.
Surrounded by multiple games upon multiple screens,
Lions and Pats, Cards and Hawks.
Friends of old sitting across from one another, stories--once told,
Now again and again--flung casually about, bouncing
Here and there and here and there...
The fireplace aglow, and another on-tap round,
Orange-slice garnishings.
Cheers were in order, and the Verrado Grille,
Also relaxing in the mid-morning sun and welcoming any and all
Who have the luxury of lazy, weekend afternoons,
Hosted.

Here, you recline.

And at noontime sharp,
Our Happy Hour,
Suggestions, recommendations, libations...
Fives and sixes, listed mixes,
And fondues and sliders
And caesars and ritas.
Truffles and pretzels, wings, quesadillas...
Verrado Grille makes your stay easy.
The game's not over, however.
So stay awhile.
Enjoy
The moment and the
Smiles
Surrounding
You."}
{"text":"A golf course restaurant that offers high quality food and drinks at a very good price. Average entree is about $10-15.00 and the portions are big. I visited thus place twice while visiting family and it was a great place with awesome servers. Ask for Desi when you go.  She is great!"}
{"text":"This review is based more on their happy hour menu/apps. We join our neighbors here for happy hour about every-other-week for 2 reasons. 1. We live in the BFE (aka Verrado), and this is 1 of 3 restaurants in the community, and 2. They have a pretty stellar happy hour. $5 apps, house margies, sangria and wine, and beer is $3-$3.50 depending on what you get. Sitting on the patio right on the golf course doesn't hurt either...especially if you're lucky enough to get one of the setting in the lounge area. I would go as far to say that their apps are better than their entrees. The truffle fries (HUGE serving), wings and bruschetta (with tons of halved tomatoes and fresh greater parmesan) are an absolute must. Had breakfast there a couple of times, and it's most definitely nothing to write home about. Quite bland actually. I've had a few options for dinner and it's usually hit and miss. Again...happy hour is where it's at!"}
{"text":"I like the Verrado Grille dispite the long wait for entrees and the lackluster service i've received the two times i've been here. But the food is excellant, the views are terrific out on the patio, and my appetizers and drinks are always quick so i'm not terribly put out when my entree takes an additional 30-45 minutes. On Friday or Saturday nights a reservation is a good idea. I love the salmon but they never seem to have the lamb in stock! Good steaks too."}
{"text":"Great music and happy hour on Friday nights. The food is consistently good but the service is sometimes a little slow. The view is amazing. Nestled in the mountains it's a great place watch the sunset over their little lakes with the mountains in the background. They have a good breakfast menu and do really nice brunches for special holidays like Easter & Mother's Day."}
{"text":"Our first time here this morning and candy took really good care of us! Compared to the vic we didn't have to wait 30 minutes for our drinks!! Very good first experience and it helped that we had such a great waitress! Thank you candy"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service, and a beautiful venue. Loved our evening here. From drinks, to salad, to entrees, and desserts, everyone  at our table was happy. And with 8 people, we had a large enough selection of dishes to be able to judge."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best hidden treasure of the desert.
Verrado Grill has one of the best and tastiest menu in the Valley.
From the appetizers to the main menu to the dessert everything is prepared with love and creativity.
Make sure you check out the patio during the cooler temperatures."}
{"text":"As a resident of Verrado going on 2 years, a transplant from Lake Forest, IL the Verrado Grille reminds me of a The Bristol, very cool atmosphere. The Food is Great and those drinks are to die for, Pricing is about the same like Red Lobster but the experience is so wonderful.  Love it."}
{"text":"Outdoor seating a must til it gets hot.  Beautiful view.  Lunch was very good .. Server a little abrupt and not in tune with the quiet elegant surroundings.
Verrado a very nice place to hang out."}
{"text":"Good food.  Service mediocre. Eaten here several times and the food has always been good and the service always a little slow and unprofessional.  The menu is a bit odd.  Very eclectic selection of dishes.  The fish and chips are very good as are the Main Street Tacos."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said about the Verrado Grille... It's mediocre \"American\" food, with clubhouse prices, and notoriously terrible service. Stop here for drinks after golf, but skip the food. 

Our family lives in Verrado, and we have been here at least 5 times, always hoping that this beautiful restaurant space right on the golf course, in the heart of downtown was living up to its potential. I have never once been impressed by my food or the service, which ranges from moderately bland to offensively inedible. The great view and proximity to the golf course are what carried the second star.

This last visit, we ordered fish and chips (average, but seemed fresh), a Cuban (the bread was charred so black it was inedible), and two \"clubhouse burgers\" (one was drenched in disgustingly solid \"cheese sauce\" and the other previously frozen patty was burned so far past the ordered \"medium\" that I could hardly eat it). Pathetic attempt really. 

I will say, there is a glimmer of hope for this place. Our service this round was better, and there appeared to be a new manager running the joint. Here's hoping they redo the menu and help to bring this place up to snuff, so it can thrive along with the rest of downtown."}
{"text":"This place service is the worst I have not been back for over a year but thought I would try again. I was wrong over a hour to get your meal service was slow hard to get a refill food was over cooked.  I know most the residents stop going as I lived there nine years and it has been bad service always. Take the time for try another place"}
{"text":"A better than average golf course type restaurant. Good food but not great. I will say they do a good job with their offerings around Thanksgiving time. If you sit on the outside the view of the 18th hole is worth while. I will occasionally eat here when in town but dont go out of your way."}
