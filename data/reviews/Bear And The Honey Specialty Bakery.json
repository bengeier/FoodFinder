{"text":"I cannot say enough how great my experience was with the Bear and The Honey and Monique.  My wife has celiac disease.  So, when I saw a review about Bear and the Honey, I thought I would give it a try.  I contacted Monique and told her my wife's likes and she created the best cake (tasting and appearance).  It was perfect not only in the sense that it was gluten free but Monique was able to capture what I did not even know I was looking for.  We also tried the gluten free cinnamon rolls - another must try."}
{"text":"Excellent desserts! Monique can accommodate anything you need (dietary wise), and she has a great variety of baked goods. Her desserts taste so good, you feel guilty, even if you shouldn't. Great gluten free and great vegan desserts."}
{"text":"We recently had our first taste of Bear and the Honey desserts and they were fantastic!!  The flavors we tried were very unique (lemon rosemary cookies) and were really great.  Monique is so easy to work with and accommodating. She'll make anything you want and takes your dietary restrictions into consideration. When was the last time you had a gluten free dessert that tasted like it wasn't?!?  Give her a try and she'll change your mind! 5 stars for sure (6 if I could)"}
{"text":"Thank you, Monique for doing everything you could to make things work for my daughter's special day. You definitely went above and beyond to help my daughter's 1st birthday be a success. I will order macarons from you again in the future! Thanks again."}
{"text":"Mo is AMAZING! She accommodates to your dietary needs and makes every creation of hers exceptional. You can tell when someone just throws something together and when someone puts their passion, creativity, and heart into their work. That is what she does. She puts so much positive energy into anything she bakes. Her cupcakes, cinnamon rolls, scones, cakes, pies, zona tarts, etc. are the best I have ever had!  CHECK HER OUT!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness a vegan bakery I am in love. The cinnamon rolls and the pop tarts are wonderful! I cannot wait to try the rest of the vegan desserts available."}
