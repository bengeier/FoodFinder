{"text":"Good real Mexican food. Chimichanga with shredded beef was delicious. Only thing is that it didn't come with rice. It is not as hole-in-the-wall as expected. It's in the airier hotel area on top of a little hill."}
{"text":"After we ate we noticed that one of the crackers was chewed up by a rodent. Wouldn't recommend or go back to the place at all."}
{"text":"My husband and I were left stranded in Charlotte by US Airways, so we had to find a hotel and dinner. The hotel clerk recommended Miguel's and we are glad! Don't let the slightly rundown look of the building discourage you from eating here. The place was filled with people in both their inside and outside dining areas when we arrived around 8 pm, so we knew the food had to be good.  My hubby ordered a plate of enchiladas that were stuffed full of chicken and he said the sauce was wonderful. My Arroz con Pollo was absolutely the best I have ever eaten, and I order this dish at almost every Mexican restaurant I visit. Also, don't forget to try their flour tortillas...they are fresh!"}
{"text":"This a great quick Mexican spot. Food is pretty good. Margarita pitchers are GREAT!!!! Just had the shrimp burrito and I loved it. What I didn't like was the carnitas and that is what I usually order at any other Mexican restaurants; but theirs were a bit hard for me. I work near Miguel's so when I feel Mexican, this is my to go spot"}
{"text":"Well, this is a hole in the wall if there was one. Random location that you would never think to enter unless you read the review on Yelp. We were worried that Yelpers may have lead us a stray. As ramshackle as the bldg. is,  the location is only 3-4 minutes from the airport's car rental return & near gas stations for you to refill. Now on to the food:  We were immediately served with warm tortilla chips and delicious house salsa. Pureed salsa that was mild with a hint of heat. Very good. Ordered a side of guac. It did have real avocado but it seemed mixed with something & was a little runny. Not the way I like quac but it might be good to others.    The chix. enchilada was fantastic. Tender tasty chix & lots of it along with a couple of onions & bell peppers. It wasn't slathered in sauce either and the sauce was yummy. Highly recommend.   The ground beef taco was good but paled in comparison to the enchilada (in our order we had 2).  Also had the chili relleno. Very unusual. Almost a Con Queso dip. The chili was chopped and mixed in with a  meet & cheese mixture. It was served next to the beens & it was almost the same color & consistency. Once we figured out it was the chili relleno, we devoured it. I ate it on a chip with some house salsa. yum. I would definitely recommend it but would ask them to use less cheese if I ordered it again.   Also had a beef tamale. There was a little shredded beef inside, but mostly it was the tamale breading with a ground beef & sauce mixture pored over it. My husband enjoyed it, but for me it wasn't as good as the relleno or enchilada so I only had a bite.  As a San Diegan who has access to excellent Mexican food on a daily basis, I would say the food here could go head to head with some of San Diego's Mexican restaurants.    Our bill was $22 with tip for all that food plus a soda- much better price, value and taste than anything you'll eat in the airport. If you have time, highly recommend pulling over here instead of a quick bite at the airport.  I am writing this review in the airport about an hour after finishing our meal & I still have a very very full stomach."}
{"text":"I think the only reason why this place has so many reviews is because it is centrally locate by several key hotels and ctl airport. If you are starving and need something quick, then this place is for you. If not, the cleanliness of the place and the over all cheap decor and picnic table furniture may scare away the slightest of above average consumer. The food I give a 3.. Service I give a 4, cleanliness I give a 2. Add those up= 9/3=3 stars in my book."}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp while traveling. Don't judge by the looks. Food was authentic Mexican. Good quantity and quality. Chips are home made and crisp. Marinated pork in green sauce is awesome."}
{"text":"I conducted a little research in our area for \"authentic\" Mexican Restaurants and this place delivered! We weren't looking for warm and fuzzy or TLC (who has time for the chit chat when you're hungry).  We were simply looking for a clean place to eat that offered good food and good service. This place delivered...hands down! We walked in before the Panthers crowd and was seated right away.  My husband is as finicky as a cat when in comes to dining out and it's safe to say that this will definitely be our go to spot.  The food and service was excellent and the establishment was clean and inviting."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating Miguel ' s.   I especially enjoy their El Combo.  The restaurant is small so occasionally you may have to wait for a table.  Their service is a little spotty but their food makes up for it.  They serve real honest Mexican food.  If you like Mexican food you will enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is phenomenal! I stopped in to grab lunch because I was craving Mexican food before my flight. The service is fast & it's right by the airport. The salsa is awesome!! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The kind of of place I miss in San Diego.  Authentic Mexican, ho hype, great taste at reasonable prices.  Check their web site for the specials.  Busy on Thursday night at 9pm.  Their menu was extensive with many items for the non-Mexican food fan.  Looking at most of the dishes coming out, they are healthy portions.  The beers come in huge mugs.  I will come back... Often."}
{"text":"food quality a 4, server attitude 2 so averaged at 3. said thank you after drink delivery no response repeated thank you at food delivery still no response, finally spoke when delivering check. Chips and Salsa are a 5!"}
{"text":"Was staying at a hotel in the area so we decided to give it a try. Food was delicious and house margaritas were even better!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall and a bit hard to find. That being said, the food is fantastic. I've had lunch there a few times and its very inexpensive. Their tamales are fluffy, the fajitas are well seasoned and their mole is complex like a good mole should be. I have never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to this place!!  It looks like a little hole in the wall but the food is great!  As well as the service!  It's close to my boyfriends work and that's how I found out about it!  Everyone he works with raves about their salsa!  And it is de-lish!  Every day they have lunch specials and it's very affordable.  They also have outside seating which is nice."}
{"text":"Man i've been coming here since i was 9 years old and it has never disappointed. The salsa is so freakin good and their daily specials for lunch and dinner are perfectly priced.   I've had everything on this menu at least once, my favorite things are enchiladas, pollo con crema and the shrimp burritos washed down with their authentic horchata.   Skip the margaritas, they don't put enough liquor in em."}
{"text":"Great local Mexican spot for cold beer and authentic food."}
{"text":"Miguel's is good for what it is: simple Mexican served on a simple place a TA really good price. I'm guessing that previous reviewers complaining about salt or the taste of the cheese have never eaten in Baja. The food is simple and tasty, just like is served in cantinas in Mexico. The taquitos (flautas, really) I had were simple, full of meat, and delicious. If your idea of Mexican is fajitas in Dallas, you won't like the place."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican  food served by good people at vertical reasonable  prices   Worth a visit"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the area. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food this is the place for you. From the chips and salsa to the tacos or margaritas, everything is made with love. I visit this place as often as possible. I recommend to anyone who is a lover of great food and great customer service. Try it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Don't let the appearance fool you. First impression is that of a dive BUT the food offered is excellent!  Had a combination of taco, chalupa, and enchilada.   Would definitely stop again!"}
{"text":"South of the Border dinner with out leaving the USA. Had a great selection is authentic Mexican food including stuffed pablano and pork with salsa verde. They were both so good we ordered some beef and chicken tacos. One dish was better than the next. Drinks and service were both great.mWe are from Pa so unfortunately we can't eat here once a week but I will be going back again tonight."}
{"text":"Service wasn't the greatest, it seemed I was an inconvenience to be waited on. My waitress kept returning to her perch at the bar. Another table she was waiting on finally gave up getting their check and left cash on the table when they left. The food was typical frozen Tex-Mexican affair the salsa had an abundance of garlic salt in it making it quite pungent. It seems drink specials are a favorite here. I would not come here if you are looking for good authentic Mexican food and a friendly atmosphere. Go to Pacos Tacos instead, better food & service for the same price.  After posting this review and reading the other low star reviews it is apparent that the service is horrible here and not just a one time affair. Go else where."}
{"text":"Definitely the best part of the day after being screwed by the airlines. The Cold beer and some of the best Mexican food I've had was exactly what we needed. It's an easy walk from the hotels in the airport."}
{"text":"Some of the best places I have eaten have needed some major makeovers, so the look of the restaurant didn't bother me. The food however was really dry, and not at all authentic. I am still surprised to find  ground beef inside the burritos and tacos, the meat was overcooked and dry. I have traveled most of Mexico and the West coast. I have never had anything like this, and there have been bad ones. Maybe it's an east coast thing. We were referred by many people claiming this place was great. I'm convinced those people have no taste buds, and have never had authentic Mexican food. Very disappointed!!! Our search will continue, I have hope that somewhere in Charlotte I will find good Mexican food."}
{"text":"The first time my husband brought me here for dinner I thought he was out of his mind. I'm so glad i kept an open mind. It took me a few visits to find my favorite entree and now that I have I'm addicted. My new favorite meal is the arroz con camarones (Shrimp w/ rice). The onions are sweet and the shrimps are flavorful. Yum. Of all the times I have visited Miguel's I have never had a bad experience. The servers are always attentive and nice. Definately give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Miguel's exceeded our expectations. We were hesitant to try it, as we are not from the area. But wow! The salsa and queso were spectacular! I had the taquitos, and highly recommend those. The fajitas looked great as well. 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall Mexican gem in west Charlotte. Lunch specials may be best deal around."}
{"text":"As other Yelpers have mentioned, ambience is not a priority here. In fact, the outside felt a little like the Bates Motel!   However, the food is quite tasty and not expensive. I enjoy the taco combo with pulled beef, rice and beans.  My companion has tried the chicken taco salad, fajitas, burritos and enchiladas.  We have always found our food to be very yummy.  I've been here a dozen times and always see the same people working. They are also very generous with the chips and salsa, and they pour a biiiig ol' soda, which I appreciate-I hate to have to continually wave down a server for a refill when the soda comes in small glasses.  It can get busy, and I love to see all the different kinds of people willing to jam into this little space to eat some good Mexican food!"}
{"text":"The location doesn't even matter because the food is absolutely delicious! Service was amazing as well, the minute we sat we were helped!"}
{"text":"Love the hot wings they have here, also have some pretty good drinks on Friday's , bathrooms could be a little cleaner tho, but other than that the food is great"}
{"text":"Food took a long time to arrive and then was underwhelming. Chilaquiles were indistinguishable from nachos and did not come with the promised beans. Beans are important to me. Waiter gave as little attention as he possibly could have, leaving my drink empty for the whole meal and never checking in. I caught him after I was done eating and asked for the check and a refill. He dropped a new cup of water off at my table, without ice or as much as a glance and then I waited a long while longer for the check. And then the register broke and the saga continued. I would not come back or recommend."}
{"text":"A hidden gem who's exterior says \"keep driving\", but absolutely the best mexican food around.  The fajita's for two is fully loaded, and I have never found better.  The specials are good and cheap.  Their customers come from all over. Being near the airport, it is a great layover experience for travelers stuck in CLT."}
{"text":"Pulling up to Miguel's makes one feel like they're about to enter a horror movie sequence. It's just that kind of vibe...and I'm glad. I'd like to say that it keeps away the crowds...but it doesn't. Miguel's is always packed.  If you haven't come here for lunch...you probably won't...but it is worth noting that two people can get in and out for under $10 total (with chips and salsa) by getting the daily special. Seriously...who doesn't like that?  The food here can range from great...to...so disappointed...but hey...always order the special and you can't really get too upset...can you?  I like Miguel's, the service is quick...no banter...just order, eat, get up and pay...leave. I've never been here outside of lunch since I'm not driving 30 minutes to grab Mexican.  If you haven't been here. Come here.  Try: The lunch specials (weren't you listening!)  Avoid: Getting here late in the lunch hour"}
{"text":"I travel on business often from San Antonio Texas  and I make it a point to vist Miguel's the night  before I return home. I have been very pleased with the service, prompt turnaround on the food and above all, the taste of authentic mexican food."}
{"text":"In my opinion Miguel's has the best Mexican food in Charlotte and their salsa is amazing. The prices are very reasonable and they offer daily specials."}
{"text":"I was a bit nervous due to some poor reviews. It this place couldn't be better!!! Enchilada verdes are awesome. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Service suuuuuuucks! I ask 3 times for a refill and never got it. The waiters walked by my table at least a dozen times after and never looked at me. There seems to be a real lazy attitude with all the staff. Also,  I've been to Mexico and this food doesn't even come close to real mexican food."}
{"text":"Terrible. The beef on the tacos has so much fat that it literally drips and soaks the taco. I always ask for soft shell and they always bring hard and I have to wait for them to bring me the right order. Going to on the border or something of that sort is better, at least you know you're gonna be eating quality meat/product."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food at low prices. yeah, it isn't Fancy, but I am so glad I found this little gem!  Thanks Yelp!!"}
{"text":"Basic little Mexican restaurant with so so service. The food is reasonably priced and relatively good.   My favorite part about this place is their outdoor seating area. Covered booths with open air windows.   My suggestion for this place would be the fajitas, something difficult to screw up. The re fried beans leave much to be desired, they are soupy and bland. I have only had a few different entrees here, usually opting for the tacos or burritos when looking for a quick cheap lunch.   Miguel's was hard to find on my first trip there, you see it through the woods driving down Little Rock Rd. but the entrance is no where in site, not to mention once you do find it it's a little confusing being attached to a hole-in-the-wall motel next door."}
{"text":"This is why Yelp is great. I would never have found this place without searching Yelp. It is the perfect dive Mexican restaurant. I came I on a Wed and they had a special of $2 imported beers. The food was great. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came across this restaurant on yelp after traveling from the airport. I was excited after reading all the great reviews. The restaurant had a decent crowd of people, leaving me the impression that I'd made the right choice. However my food was mediocre and it was served on a dirty plate.  That ruined it for me the most.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"Best \"hole in the wall\" - dive mexican restaurant in town. Just simple cheap good food.  I go every time I am in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food and strawberry margaritas in charlotte. Great cheese dip, tacos, and fajitas"}
{"text":"Address is 4300, not 4252. It's around the corner past the Wyndham, attached to what looks like a deserted motel. They have an outside part without windows. The inside is behind.  Looks creepy, but the food is great."}
{"text":"After reading about this place on Yelp we decided to try it out and we were not disappointed! The queso was so good as were the steak fajitas! Deff check it out!"}
{"text":"This was a very good place to eat! Who would of guessed that this little place that looks crappy on the out side would be so good. I would have rated this five stars however, our waitress didn't talk. Over all great place."}
{"text":"The old saying \"Don't judge a book by its cover\" holds true at Miguels.   My husband found this place on yelp and we decided to give it a try. The outside leaves much to be desired. Though the outdoor patio-esque area looked fun...However for a snowy NC dat, we sat inside.   We were immediately presented with menus and chips and salsa. We ordered the Speedy Gonzalez (special for the day for $4.50), Chili Relleno, and the chicken soup. Also got two dos equis drafts....Excellent price at $2.50!   The ranchero sauce on the enchilada was perfection. I also loved the refried beans. However the chicken soup was the winner for me. Great broth flavor and loaded down with chicken and rice. Exactly what I needed on a cold day.   I think our bill ended up being around $20 for everything. This place is the real deal and quite possibly jumped to my second favorite Mexican joint in the city!"}
{"text":"The food was horrible not authentic Mexican restaurant. Extremely bad service! I wouldn't eat there if that was the last food on this earth! I don't know how it's highly rated when the food was crap!!!"}
{"text":"Miguel's is a Charlotte staple. Unchanged by corporate influence and more consistent than anywhere. This is truly the best Mexican in Charlotte. Make sure to stop in when heading to the airport. Lunch specials for $4.25  to die far and beer on tap! You will have to try to spend money here. The best of the best know miguel's is the place to be."}
{"text":"Love the idea, concept, and ... well, the idea and concept.  Miguels was recommended by my hotel staff since I was staying at one of the 8 hotels on my street by the airport, and zero bars within walking distance. The hotel offered to drop me off here, since it is within their \"radius.\"  Okay, so, the place is small. The beer is cold/good. Service was okay, food was meh. They were busy, so after I was finished eating my enchiladas, I would have felt awkward sitting in the booth having a beer when people were standing up waiting for a table. I just wanted to get my drink on... this is not the place for that.  Recommend in a pinch, but if you want to hit the drinks, take a $7 uber to Pinky's (where I ended up) or go downtown and have a plethora of options."}
{"text":"Had the tamales and chimi. Food was excellent. Don't let the location intimidate you. It conveniently located near CLT airport and the nearby hotels."}
{"text":"I was really in need of a to-go order of chicken soup to battle a cold, so I searched Yelp for suggestions within the area that I work. I could NOT have made a better choice. In addition to having the very best chicken soup that I've ever had in my life, I also ordered 1 beef crispy taco, and had some chips and salsa.   Miguel's is a neat and clean restaurant with a consistent good health grade - most being 95 and above. Like the old cliche: \"don't judge a book by its cover\" because you'll be losing out on an awesome meal."}
{"text":"Had the tilapia burrito. They were really good!!! The waitress was really nice. Get ready for it if you ask for the big beer, it's huge. Even the chips they gave us before were tasty. The place isn't fancy or doesn't look very appealing but the food is totally worth it especially if u are in the neighborhood. I put 4 out of 5 just because I've had better Mexican food and if it hadn't been recommended I probably wouldn't have gone, but definitely had a good experience"}
{"text":"Has this place been changed?  Not as good as I used to come before.  Having discussed with family who has restaurant business as well, I rather be honest.  I will not eat here again.  I believed it was their attitude.  I sat down to asked for a hot water as I just finished exercise and didn't want to have ice cold drink.  That would mostly considered as cheap customers.  :) After I had placed my food order, I hardly felt those servers would stop by even I was thinking of ordering a drink.    Quality of food dropped as I kept picking husk from my food.   I then saw some small animals on the floor, perhaps the restaurant was too old. That's OK!  I just need to look for another place for my favorite Mexican food."}
{"text":"After seeing such high reviews I expected so much more! Food was awful! It came out cold. It took over 15 min just to get water. Had to go to the bar and ask for a refill. My margarita that I ordered before my food, came over 40 min later... After I had completely finished my food.  It's not like they had a ton of people there, it was 1/2 empty. There was nothing good about this place. Repulsive!!! I don't see how they are even in business."}
{"text":"This was great - good Mexican food, nice homey atmosphere.  The service was slow (typical of the South; not unusually slow) and the guacamole is not as I like it (runny).  But the shrimp enchiladas were very good.  And the prices are more than reasonable.  A great place for a cheap good dinner."}
{"text":"PEOPLE BEWARE!!! Do not be fooled by these reviews! This place is a joke at best. I am from this area and would have to say that this particular establishment is hands down the worst experience you will EVER encounter!!! Honestly I have no earthly idea where or how these wonderful reviews come about! I've been to EVERY Mexican restaurant in the Queen City and without doubt this is the bottom of the barrel! The wait staff act as if their last job was at the DMV!! Horrible service, less than friendly would be putting it mildly!!! Totally reminded me of a Mexican soup nazi attitude!!! Do yourself a favor and mark this one off the list!!! Azteca, taco veloz and carnita's is the way to go!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic find at a great price! Don't let the appearance of the curbside fool you. Perfect hole in the wall kind of place."}
{"text":"XX Amber on tap, ridiculously good food, and great service.  Can't tell you how much I love this place. If you are flight crew stuck in the Wingate next door, this is THE place to spend the evening"}
{"text":"Fantastic little Mexican joint in the quiet little town of Charlotte MX... Seriously the outside screams Mexico! The food is amazing!! The beers are super cold! (Colder than Mexico) The carnitas tacos were fantastic! Fajitas were fantastic! The one and only thing I would say was so so was the guacamole, it was still good but could use a revamp on the recipe... Other than that,, I would NOT change a thing!! Can't wait till next time!"}
{"text":"We just flew in from out of town and was looking for a place to eat near the hotel. This popped up locally and had 4 1/2 stars. So we decide to go check it out. We were not impressed by just driving by so we went somewhere else. However throughout the week the name just kept popping up and we decided to give it a try for last night. The food was excellent, we will definitely come back if we would visit again.  We had a Margarita pitcher, thought it could've used more alcohol, it was pretty weak, but the food and the desserts were very good. We recommend the place."}
{"text":"I took my daughter who was visiting from DC and discovered this jewel of a restaurant!  Ordered the margaritas,quest, chips , and salsa and immediately knew it was authentic!    It is clean no frills but friendly stomp sphere.  The tacos al pastor & chilies poblano a were absolutely delicious!  It is must visit when in the vicinity of the airport...just 5-10 minutes away!"}
{"text":"I am in town from Ohio and the place was recommended by a local... Place looks like an old run down hotel but the service was fast food was great and beer was cold... Would recommend to anyone... 5 stars if not for the building..."}
{"text":"Miguel's is definitely not a hip place, but the people know how to make a proper fajita!   They have cheap drinks and wine. My Merlot was what you'd expect for just over $3, and it was chilled, but it washed down some good steak, chicken and shrimp fajita (the highlight of my dinner, for sure). The salsa was also kickin' (mild!), although I think the chips were bland. I also splurged and got a fried ice cream, even though I was stuffed... Big mistake , but it was tasty.   I would give 3.5 stars, but it's not an option."}
{"text":"A hole-in-the-wall kind of restaurant, which would make you think its a hidden gem... but not so much.   Pina Colada was definitely lacking, superrrr watery. Salsa is great, smooth and spicy! Chips were stale, even when we sent our basket back and asked for a fresh batch.   Tacos and nachos featured more stale chips/tortillas & watery queso.   Basically, the star is for the quiet outdoor seating and quick delivery of food to the table. But overall, don't bother with this hole-in-the-wall."}
{"text":"Not sure how it got so many good reviews. Bad (too salty!) salsa.  Bad (line Kool aid) margarita's!  Bad (sullen!) service!  I am usually a pretty positive scorer but was REALLY disappointed here."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant. Small family run place. I always get the Pork Chile Verde which is great. The chips and salsa are good as well.  I would recommend you come try it for yourself."}
{"text":"They have the best enchiladas of anywhere I have tried. If anyone knows of better ones let me know but at the moment these are king of the hill."}
{"text":"So Miquel's is definitely a perfect definition for a \"Hole in the Wall\" but let's be honest those places clearly have the best food.   As a self proclaimed Mexican fanatic I was excited to see just what this place had to offer.   We started with the chips and salsa and they were classic. The chips were warm and crispy and the salsa had just the right amount of kick!   My friends and I ordered a little bit of everything...fajitas, shrimp quesadillas, tacos, rice and beans.   Everything was delicious...and the portion sizes were perfect! Add to that good service and super reasonable prices! I'm absolutely coming back."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican!!!  Don't let the location or the building fool you, it's a hidden gem...a very well hidden gem. It's a small whole in the wall, but as usual those are the good places. The food was great! They have indoor and outdoor seating. The service was also good, and according to my friends who I tagged along with, the coca-cola there is amazing too!"}
{"text":"Had to stay overnight in the area and the hotel suggested we try this place but that had warned us that is was a \"hole in the wall\" and that was exactly right. It could use some TLC.  Moving onto the food, they have a HUGE menu. So many meals sounded so good, I had a hard time deciding. We started with the queso and guac for an appetizer which was decent. Since it was a mexican place i did order 1 taco, I had to and glad i did. The people I was with had a pitcher of margarita also which they said was strong but good. For dinner I had the shrimp in garlic sauce which was delicious, a must try. One person though in my party did order the steak and cheese burrito which is not what she got.  We did not complain though, the waitress seemed like she really didnt want to be working that night. Skip desert, not worth the couple dollars, again we asked for chocolate ice cream and got vanilla...bummer!"}
{"text":"What a find not far out of CLT airport. Hidden away in the remains of an old hotel restaurant the food and service was tasty and fast! I will definitely stop here again when fly into Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place might scare you at first glance. But don't miss out!! Beer mugs are frozen. Beer is cold, service is friendly fast and food Is great!  It seems to be a family run business. It NOT a chain. It's not a shnazy place, booths and picnic tables. If you a foodie this is not a place to miss..if you are a snob..don't bother.. Again..great Mexican food!! Home made salsa. Everything is made to order."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and wonderful service. The beer kept on coming and the chimichanga was excellent. Ask the senora for her recommendations and you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican joint in Charlotte always crowded, always good, always cheap. Special Fajitas  are a fav, served with a half pitcher of Margarita please."}
{"text":"A fantastic Mexican restaurant very close to the airport.  There is nothing fancy about this place, but it is perfect.  Quick, efficient service with excellent Mexican fare.  I would come here every week, if I lived in Charlotte.  Muy bien Amigos!"}
{"text":"Awful! Service is awful, food was awful, order was wrong. Do not go here, not worth ur money"}
{"text":"If you blink, you'll miss this hidden gem. Mistakenly went on cinco de mayo...it was PACKED! If the weather had cooperated, more people would've sat in the patio area. Since it was frio de mayo, everyone scrambled for a seat inside. My sister and I snagged two seats at the bar, scanned the menu and ordered. I ordered enchiladas rancheras. It was EVERYTHING! Two cheese enchiladas topped with beef & pork, onions, peppers. The flavor was intense and delicious. Not over powering and spicy. My sister ordered something with chicken, which she enjoyed. The pitcher of Margaritas Tejas could be why I don't remember what she ordered. A little sweet, but worth the price."}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican food.  Don't let the rundown hotel next to it fool you.  Very good food."}
{"text":"It's my first time here.  You know the saying about first impression?  Well, I came here based on the reviews & sometimes the best gems are holes in the walls.  This is NOT one of them.  I ordered some kind of an imitation guacamole paste, hate when restaurant give fake food.  they delivered my spicy shrimp & never once checked on me.  When they gave me my check there was no thank you not even gracias!   I think a robot could be programmed to be more polite than the people here."}
{"text":"Miguel's is a pretty ordinary joint - canteen type place. Nothing special about it. The lady who served us was so cold & uncourteous, sitting at the restaurant for half an hour felt like a chore. Am not going back to this particular one for sure!"}
{"text":"The other day someone posted a question about eating near the airport and Miguel's popped in my mind and ever since I posted my response,  I could not get it out of my mind so today was Miguel day. When you drive up it looks condemned, it's on 85 Interstate Service Rd, (exit 32 Little Rock Rd) that right there, sounds sketchy.  It's beside a closed motel, (Bates Motel reference).  This alone makes me LOVE this restaurant.  It is everything you want it to be in that off the beaten path kind of way.  They don't serve the best food, the margarita is average, service is functional, but all of it wrapped up it's like heaven."}
{"text":"Awesome place and a good example of why you shouldn't judge the book by the cover. I Was visiting from out of town and the hotel where I was staying near the airport told me there was a good Mexican restaurant down the street so I jumped in the car and headed that way. As I got really close I was a little hesitant because of the way it looked from the outside. Turned out it was awesome food and the wait staff was very nice.   I would definitely recommend going there to eat."}
{"text":"Great food!!!  Great service!  Great prices!  Authentic Mexican food in a casual setting. Three of us enjoyed three different entrees and all said we would definitely go back. Was close to the motel we stayed in while waiting for our next morning flight out of CLT.  Wouldn't stay in that motel again but will eat at Miguel's again for sure!"}
{"text":"Extremely poor service and terrible food. It took 50 minutes to get our food, some of it was hot, some of it was not. The margaritas didn't taste like there was any alcohol in them. Also, our server was terrible, rude, never checked back and again it took almost an hour to get food from the time we ordered. Worst Mexican food I've ever had... I should have taken pics of our struggle plates."}
{"text":"This was the worst Mexican food. Everything was extremely salty.  The service was terrible.  The waiters said nothing to us the entire time. Do not go here. Ever."}
{"text":"Food is good at reasonable price but there service is pathetic. You need to wait for them to take the order and then for payment. They will be busy in doing other work rather than service you"}
{"text":"All previous reviews are quite accurate. I was on my way to catch a flight and was a little early and hungry. This place is \"A Diamond in the Rough.\" I mean...you would not see it from the main road and it is literally sandwiched between a hotel and nothingness.   The people are about food. No small talk. No warm smiles. We were pointed, not taken, to a table. Their horchata is really good. The complimentary salsa and chips were also very good, with a bit of a kick. The waiter took our order which was a fajita taco salad and a regular taco salad. Both were good, but the fajita one was better. The only problem was I didn't realize that it came with guacamole. I usually ask about it, but I didn't see it mentioned on the menu so I forgot. Avocado gives me a gag reflex so I had to eat around it.   Not sure if we'll ever come back, only because of the location...but if we find ourselves on that side of town, I wouldn't object to a visit."}
{"text":"In town on business and wanted a 'local place'.  Hit the nail on the head with Miguel's. In my book...it all begins with the chips and salsa.  Not going to lie, probably the best salsa I have had, certainly in recent memory. Absolutely delicious and the chips were great too. The place looks right out of a 60's diner with bar stools and red vinyl booths but don't let the dated decor fool you. Played it safe with a combo fajita platter. Everything was seasoned to perfection. The steak may have been left on the grill a tad long but it all tasted phenomenal. The portions weren't huge which was actually refreshing. Coming from the guy who eats everything in front of him it was a pleasant surprise. I left fully satisfied but not over stuffed and that was with two helpings of chips and salsa. The service was stellar. Didn't have to ask for refills - or anything for that matter- they just came quickly. The prices are more than reasonable for the food and quality. All in All a great experience!  Do yourself a favor and check this place out."}
{"text":"This is the true definition of a dive. Don't go in expecting much, just amazing food at great prices. One of the best Mexican restaurants I have been to.  Never judge a book by it's cover. Simple decor, standard mexican menu, but amazing food. If you are staying at a hotel near by, it's worth the walk.  The service can be a little slow when it's busy but when you take a bite, you'll forget about it all."}
{"text":"Just ate Miguel's for lunch today and got my fill of fast food Mexican for a decent price.  I'm not overly impressed by the place, but it makes for a nice meal if you're in the Paw Creek area (85 and Little Rock Rd.).  There's an open \"veranda\" for dining (read: a dining room with out doors or windows attached on the front) that was a nice touch on a day like today.  Fast, cheap, and loaded with salt, what else could you ask from a local Mexican joint?  They have all the regular dishes you would find on a menu in a down-home Mexican place, plus lunches specials for about $5-$6.  I got the Speedy Gonzales, an enchilada, taco, and rice for a respectable $5.75.  The service was rather impersonal and task-focused, but maybe it was just one of those days.   I agree with Tonya that the sketch factor of  restaurants like these \"raise the stakes\": you'll either discover a hidden treasure or the Bates motel.  Miguel's, however, wasn't either one.  So maybe the \"ho-hum\"-ness of this place was my false expectations.  No hidden treasures here, just decent Mexican food."}
{"text":"I was very impressed during our visit to Miguel's. At the suggestion of a friend, we decided to make the journey to try this \"hole-in-the-wall\" place. Needless to say, the price was right and the food lived up to the expectations.  We got here early for lunch on a Saturday. We started off with $2.50 dos equis draft, speedy gonzales, chili relleno, and chicken soup. The whole meal capped out around $20 and was more than enough food for the two of us. The big winner for me was the chicken soup on this particularly cold day. It was loaded down with a ton of fresh ingredients and the flavor was awesome. I would certainly venture back out here again for lunch.  We got there right when they opened, but I have heard this place can get busy. Also they have a neat outdoor space that I would like to try when it is warmer sometime!"}
{"text":"Miguel's has been in Charlotte along time. Pretty good food, but Margaritas are very weak. They look like watered down mix. So clear you can see thru them.. Don't recommend spending 7.50 for one. They should be frosty and look like lime.."}
{"text":"As other yelpers have indicated, it is hard to not be deterred when you first pull up.  The old building combined with the large Motel sign caused me to pause and think of going somewhere else.  However, thanks to positive reviews on Yelp, I continued inside and had a very good meal.  Pricing is very reasonable and the food is good.  The service, although not the friendliest, was solid and my server checked on me often.  I was in and out in about 35 minutes, but didn't feel rushed.  Overall, I would recommend Miguel's for someone looking for a Mexican food alternative to the national chains."}
{"text":"Doesnt look like much, but man do they have some good food.  Service was okay, not the best, but didnt expect much.  The prices are extremely reasonable for any budget."}
{"text":"If you, like me, have a deep affection for hole-in-the-wall Mexican food, then look no further. My husband and I love sitting on the patio at this place and the food was great. There's just something about a local place like this that can't be beat."}
{"text":"Authentic food is hard to find. This spot is a don't judge a book by a cover. Staff is courteous and food is true indeed cooked with love. As a native from San Diego this place brings back memories and good home cooked Mexican eats.   Caution -  drinks are not shy and poured strong that with any dish is a party waiting to happen. Drink eat and be merry."}
{"text":"Para mi primera visita y ser fanático de restaurantes mexicanos ahí le vamos. La cerveza draft de 32onz es mi preferida y a buen precio. La salsa y lo nachos muy buenos. La comida muy buena pero el servicio y las atenciones de los meseros es donde único fallan. El servicio tiene mucho que mejorar. La variedad de postres es nula sólo 2 opciones. Por lo demás seguiré visitándolos para cenar."}
{"text":"This place has wonderful food at a wonderful price.  The servers are very hard working as well!"}
{"text":"This informal mexican diner spot has an outdoor covered area to eat, enjoy the breeze and some of the cars going by on the nearby freeway.  Food does the trick and the menu is extensive - hard to pick!  Lots of affordable options."}
{"text":"Delicious food at great prices from a hole-in-the-wall place in an iffy neighborhood.   Seriously. Everything was seared and grilled perfectly. The sopa pollo had so much cilantro-onion-avocado freshness, the onions and peppers in the burrito were charred just right. Even the refried beans and rice were buttery and flavorful. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Best fajitas I've ever had! The salsa and guacamole are excellent compliments to the dish. You can just taste that all of the ingredients are so fresh. I'm from Chicago and stopped here last year because I was staying at a nearby hotel. I made sure to stay at this hotel again because of this place. Highly recommended the \"Miguel's fajitas\" w/ beef, chicken & shrimp!"}
{"text":"Nothing better than some authentic mexican cuisine! The prices are great , the drinks are strong, and the food is delicious! Now this place is not fancy at all but don't let the looks of the building steer you away! The staff is nice and someone is always around when I need assistance. My favorite thing to get is the El combo. It's a nice sample of some favorites and you just can't beAt the price of it."}
{"text":"Just a simple review:  -Food was okay, at least it wasn't cold.  -Very cramped and crowded.  -Food doesn't come out at the same time.  -Takes forever to get the bill and get someone to pick up the check when you're ready to pay.  -No host, just a waitress that is across the room to point you to the least dirty table that's empty.   -The bathroom could use some soap and paper towels. And perhaps a cleaning.  All I got. At least their not rude."}
{"text":"So delicious! I'm from California where Mexican food is available on every corner, and this place was better than most Mexican restaurants I've been to. This place was absolutely delicious and cheap. Very quaint little restaurant. Outdoor seating available."}
{"text":"Good food and service would recommend. I couldnt eat tomatoes and they were very accomodating. My husband ate well he had the sample platter, I had chicken tacos. Fried ice cream was so so though"}
{"text":"I look for a place like this near every airport I visit.  There is bound to be something good and cheap around the corner, apparently pilots are good customers.  Excellent basic tex-mex and really good carnitas too.  I like to get the chile verde with the pork carnitas.  Now my go to Mexican place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"You can tell by the crowd that this is a great place to eat.  Be prepared to wait for a seat, but it's definitely worth the wait!  Pork Carnival are my favorite!"}
{"text":"I used to go to Miguel's at least once a week, I live right down the street from them. I love the food, the service and the price but lately I have noticed that the amount of food doesn't seem to be the same. If you like fancy places this is not the place for you, it is simple but very cozy."}
{"text":"Good mexican food at a great price conveniently located near the Charlotte airport.  Simple as it gets.    Service is friendly and food is good.  All of the other reviewers do a good job of explaining the ins and outs of this place, just thought I'd chime in with a solid +1  Don't come expecting fine dining, expect to get good home cooked Mexican food."}
{"text":"I love this place! Once I got over the \"late night truck stop - I'm going to be kidnapped and drug to the abandoned hotel & held for ransom\" the experience was great! The food is fresh and off the chain! Some of the best chicken I have tasted. Been a long time since I've ate at a Mexican joint and had chicken taste like chicken! The salsa, the chips, the food, AND the price for a family of 7 FAR outweighs the lack of curb appeal. I (we) will be a regular!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food!!!!! Felt like I was back in Mexico. Very authentic, great service, and cheap prices!! Enjoy"}
{"text":"I have to admit, it looks super sketchy from the exterior - we almost didn't go in. Once inside, I had some of the best Mexican food outside of Mexico! Pork verde was amazing! The service wasn't anything to rave about, but I honestly didn't care!"}
{"text":"Went today and its a cool place! We went for the lunch special since its crazy cheap. I got a beef taco and a chorizo enchilada. I wasnt a huge fan of the chorizo but everything else was AWESOME. I will definitely be coming back soon!!"}
{"text":"Definitely get the carne asada tacos. My son orders a side of grilled onions and jalapeño peppers to put on them. Excellent!! Nothing fancy and the staff aren't the most outgoing but they sure put out good food.  We will definitely come back when we fly in to Charlotte since they are so close to the airport."}
{"text":"I ordered to-go via postmates. The shrimp tacos were VERY well seasoned. Besides the retried beans that were filled inside the tacos, I didn't get any extra in the side like I'm accustomed to with he other Mexican restaurant I frequent. I honestly wish I could've had another taco instead of two made it three with some extra re fried beans on the side. I also ordered some guacamole, the consistency wasn't to my liking, almost a little thin. Like it wasn't prepared fresh. Anyway because the shrimp tacos were good, I would definitely order from them with postmates again. However bc the location is far from where I live I don't think I'd ever actually go to the physical location myself."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to eat. The food is awesome, margaritas are delicious . And the people are super friendly!! Make sure you check it out!!"}
{"text":"Food come out quick. They are very giving with their beverages. But the food seems to be pre-made and then reheated before being served. The veggies had small pieces of ice on it, and all the dishes were very watery."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Charlotte hands down. Miguel's fajitas are delicious. The shrimp burrito or quesadilla have big shrimp in them. They have a tiny bar but great margaritas. The service is curt but fast. They get really busy on Friday and Saturday nights, so go early. The outdoor seating area is nice, if you don't mind the interstate close by. Otherwise...highly recommended, my favorite restaurant in town."}
{"text":"If you can find this place, and you want some great mexican food, please stop by this little hole-in-the-wall joint, you won't regret it.  After a friend recommended Miguels, I went to check it out and almost wound up walking into the Mexican general store down the street before realizing this little trailer in front of a motel was the actual restaurant.    but looks can be deceiving.  there is an outdoor seating area, which would be nice in the warmer months.  inside, the decor is, what i would call, Mexico's version of a diner.  with the prices to match.  I ordered the Fajitas, which were on special for $8, but these were not like any i've had before.  in addition to the standard peppers and onions, they also put in zuchinni, squash, mushrooms, and other veggies that really set the dish off, making them the best fajitas i have eaten.  They also had drink specials, which I do not recall at this moment.  All in all, I had a beer and a great dinner, with leftovers to take home, for less than $12."}
{"text":"Staying near the CLT airport and the options are limited.   Not sure why.   I was searching around and the reviews made me want to try it.   Loved it.   Sunday is fajita night, it was so smoky when I walked it from all the fajitas.  There is a \"building\" separate that has no windows for extra room.  It was great, it is a dump, the service is marginal that it's almost inviting."}
{"text":"Miguel's was recommended By the locals. My steak burrito was good. Some in our group had tacos that looked less me they were straight from Taco Bell wit these hard shell and ground beef. If you are use to West Coast Mexican food, wait until you return there. It is really different."}
{"text":"I was split between a three and a four star review. The salsa was watery and bland, the dinner entry was good, and the service was good. Nothing spectacular here, and I didn't hear any of the other diners speaking Spanish. There weren't many authentic choices such as lengua, menudo, tripa, or cabeza offered."}
{"text":"Looks like a sketch place at first but pretty neat overall. Like that they have an outside area. Food could have been better but was probably my fault for what i ordered. I'll definitely go back and order something different next time."}
{"text":"You wouldn't know it from the outside but this place is FANTASTIC Tex Mex. Place is very clean and staff gives great service even when they are slammed which they usually are at lunch and dinner! A hidden Queen City gem!"}
{"text":"Whoever said this place has good food, doesn't know what good food is! The food was bad! Way too salty, cheese tasted like crap. The service was pitiful! I ordered water and guacamole at the same time, and the guacamole came 10 minutes before the water? The guacamole was basically avocado and onion, that's it! The chips were all broken and stale. The only reason this isn't 1 star is because they had horchata and they were inexpensive and close to the airport. My advice? Skip it!"}
{"text":"Really great food, service was top notch, it's kind of a hole in the wall but very clean and when the food and drinks arrive you won't care. It's mostly family members working. Well worth the money and the visit, I am definitely going to be eating here again"}
{"text":"I think this place is awesome and not because it has my name!! I used to go to CPCC and I would eat here at least 2-3 times a week. The chips and salsa are great and so is almost everything else on the menu. Do not let appearances fool you, this place is special. The price is dirt cheap and the quality is 5 star. The Serrano special is one of the best dishes I have ever had. If in Charlotte you must try this place."}
{"text":"I use to visit here often, when the service was great! It seemed liked one day it all just stopped. The quality of the food is poor along with the service."}
{"text":"When I first arrived in Charlotte the first order of business was where do I need to eat before going home and this was top on the list ( grilled cheese food truck is #2). We drive up to this hole in the wall style place with a wing of outdoor seating that was packed with people. We go inside and are met by our server who was very friendly. We ordered our queso appetizer as I begin to scour the menu for goodies. Settling on the enchiladas was an excellent choice! Overall lovely experience for a quick and reasonably priced meal. If ever in the area craving authentic style Mexican foods stop in and carb up!!"}
{"text":"Fajita for two. Four different kinds of meat: shrimp, steak, pork and chicken. A bit too oily but I guess it wouldn't taste that good if you don't put that much grease into it. Also comes with plenty tortilla bread."}
{"text":"Went in. Waited with my family. After no one came to seat us(or at least let us know if it's a seat yourself type of restaurant), I saw a waitress and waited until she served her customers and I asked \"excuse me\" to get her attention. Again, I said \"excuse me, Miss.\" She proceeded to ignore me despite making eye contact with me and my family before eventually turning her back towards us. My family and I left.   We are from FL and wanted a good Mexican meal. There was no sign around that indicated that it was a \"seat yourself\" restaurant, like I said. Instead she walked past us (keep in mind, she was in touching distance and we had to move out of her way for her to give the food to her customers.)   I will take my money and business elsewhere, thank you very much."}
{"text":"This is another in a long list of  \"Thank the flying spaghetti monster for Yelp!\"  I was flying back from Memphis and got stranded at the airport in Charlotte for the night due to bad weather in NY.  I grabbed a cheap hotel near the airport, took their shuttle bus and ended up  in the middle of some place I knew nothing about.  What to do for dinner?  Well, that's easy, let's open yelp and find something within a reasonable walking distance.  This place pops up as one of the best within a walking distance.  I would have never seen it without Yelp.  It is almost part of a little motel, tucked away in the backside of some parking lot.  I actually walked by it before turning back around and finally finding it.  They have a nice little covered outside seating area. . .and the weather was beautiful down there so I took advantage.  A little noisy because it is almost on the highway, but the weather more than made up for the noise.  The inside looks a lot like a typical American Diner, which was a bit weird, but I don't care much for decor if the food is good.  The menu was a standard and basic Mexican food menu.  I am a big fan of Carnitas and it is always hard to find decent Carnitas in the chex-mex dominated \"mexican\" food places around my place in queens. . . so I was immediately drawn to that dish.  It was absolutely great.  Nothing special or fancy, but the meat was well cooked (and cooked right which isn't always the case).  The guacamole that came with it was fresh and tasty.  The tortillas were perfectly fine and all of the trimmings were fresh and of good quality.  I then ordered a beer, she asked if I wanted a large and I said yes. . .who am I to blow against the wind?  And this thing was monstrous.  We are talking at least 24 ounces.  My bill came to about 14 dollars, which I thought was perfectly reasonable considering the size of the beer, the amount and tastiness of the meal.  Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"This is the worst Mexican restaurant I have ever been to. I am from Texas and I know great Mexican food. The service was not good and the chorizo was the saltiest I have ever had. I am now eating a bowl of ice cream just to get the taste of their food out of my mouth. Don't go there......run away!"}
{"text":"Cheap food, family-owned, good mexican beer, and even authentic desserts.  Careful not to overload on the orders though, this food really isn't all that good the next day."}
{"text":"Giving 5 stars cause one can easily eat for 8-12 dollars here and be full. I get chimichangas with the beef tips almost every time I go. The beef is always cooked to perfection: a little bite and firmness, then falls apart in slow-cooked strings in the mouth. The chimichanga is always golden brown and not oily at all. Classic white cheese sauce on top,and flavorful beans and \"guacamole salad\" on the side.  Arroz Con Pollo and Chicken soup are very flavorful and satisfying as well. Green chile chicken is delicious too.Nice gravel parking lot, scenic views of 85 and the Tuckaseegee/Little Rock intersection. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"We were way underwhelmed by the food here, but we are from the west coast and get great Mexican food back home.  My husband was pleased with his blended raspberry margi, the tacos al pastor were ok but don't get the guacamole.  It's about the worst I've had.  I would give two stars, but the prices were low, so value-wise, it gets 3."}
{"text":"Yummy and affordable. Their queso is delicious. We sometimes go here for lunch but went for dinner and $2 margaritas when I dropped a friend at the airport and it was perfect. Great service too!"}
{"text":"If you've read any of my other reviews, you know that I do NOT discriminate against hole in the wall joints. So when we drove up and saw Miguel's was nestled in the shadow of an interstate entrance ramp and was attached to a run down motel, I was like, \"I bet this food is about to be awesome.\" Now it's *possible* this is a more enjoyable dining experience when the weather is nice and you can sit at one of the tables beneath the patio breezeway. However, since it was cold and rainy, we had to sit inside, where the dining room is smaller than my living room and kitchen. The tables were so crammed together, our chairs were literally up against the chairs of the people behind us. As you can imagine, there was also no space in the room for the sound of voices to travel, so we spent the duration of our dinner yelling across the table. The service was slow, though the people at our table who ordered margaritas got them almost immediately while everyone who ordered waters had to wait almost 15 minutes to receive them. Always rubs me wrong when waiters are more than happy to deliver drinks you'll have to pay for, but not the free water. Even in spite of all that, I still would've left in good spirits had the food been satisfactory. I am not exaggerating when I say, I would've preferred Taco Bell. The standard items were fine and about what you get anywhere (rice, refried beans, queso). But the ground beef was disgusting, the sauces tasted like grocery store brand, and the generous quantity of food we received (for reasonable prices) could not save the poor quality.  We went here because it seemed to be a good halfway meeting point for dinner with the in laws. We will never return, even if it means one of us driving an extra 20 minutes to eat somewhere decent. Maybe even Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I'm officially a fan. There's room for improvement but it's everything I'd look for if I was looking for a locally owned, non-chain Mexican restaurant.  We did have a service oops. I asked for cheese dip (queso) when we sat down and ordered our drinks. It never showed up. I think the waitress forgot because it wasn't on the bill either.  The inside dining room is SMALL. As you can see from pictures that others have posted, there is also an outside portico for dining outside when the weather is nice.  Tonight it was windy and threatening rain so we didn't have that as a choice.  The location is nothing to write home about but the kitchen turns out very edible food.  Having lived in the southwest for 5 years, it doesn't measure up to what I got out in TX, AZ, etc. but by Charlotte standards, it's fantastic.  I had the Chicken Coco Loco. It was tasty!  My dining mate had stuffed pablano peppers. He cleaned his plate.  I wish I had seen the Thursday special before I ordered! I would have enjoyed that too... \"Special Burritos\".  For families, remember the space is constrained. I would not bring a rambunctious kid here. Your neighboring diners will be ready to strangle you and the kid."}
{"text":"This place is a \"no-frills\" restaurant. The food is delicious. Don't expect to be pampered. You can expect good food at cheap prices."}
{"text":"I was in town a few days for business. This was close to the hotel and I really wanted tacos. As others have noted, the look of the place is deceiving. It's something you'd drive by without noticing if you weren't looking for it, but the food and the people make up for it. I have the beef tacos and they were amazing. Chips and salsa hit the table almost the same time I did. If you're in the area, give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good. I got fish tacos and shrimp Cajun style. It was a little greasy for my taste but I will override that because they gave me avocado  lol. It definitely makes most things taste better."}
{"text":"This is that best Mexican restaurant I have ever been to. We wouldn't have walked in had it not been recommended to us because it looks like a dump but looks are deceiving. The food is delicious and so inexpensive. If you don't want fancy but want fabulous food this is the place. We live in South Carolina but come to Charlotte for frequent flights. We already stop here for a meal"}
{"text":"Very good service and food. It was healthy, fresh, and filling. We're from Texas and were happy to find a place that compares. Don't judge a book by its cover because this place is worth it."}
{"text":"I don't really write reviews unless the place is really great or really horrible. This place pure crap. The waitress acted like we were inconveniencing her and the food was below average.  The salsa was good I'll give them that. And the food was quick but it looked and tasted like it was just tossed together and the shrimp was a little too salty and overcooked and dry."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Steak and cheese enchiladas are tits! Close to the airport close to my house. Id say this is the second best mexican on the westside."}
{"text":"Traveling by air to Denver so drove to Charlotte night before. Asked hotel staff recommendations and Miguel's was on their list of close to Hampton Inn. I was always taught don't judge a book by its cover.  This is truly a \"hole in wall\" local restaurant.   We lived in Texas for 25 years and were used to excellent Tex-Mex food.  Miguel's is comparable to most in Lone Star State. Had the Mango margarita and husband had regular on rocks. Mango was very good.  Meal began with chips and salsa. Did not have the heat but was okay. Shrimp fajitas were good with zucchini, mushroom, squash, bell peppers.  The rice was good but wish there had been more guacamole. Husband had enchiladas Verdes. There was a heaping amount of chicken in the three. We took two sopaipilla back to hotel.  Thank goodness we had refrigerator with freezer. Yum two large containers of vanilla ice cream. Half time ball game deserts!"}
{"text":"Good food, cheap prices but slow service. The place was packed. Recommend if not on a tight schedule."}
{"text":"So unbelievably good! Had an overnight layover in Charlotte and the shuttle driver recommend this place. So glad I listened! The food was outstanding, employees very friendly, decor so cutie, and service was very quick.  The menu was huge. Around 8 pages. One that was all vegetarian options and another of American style food. So nice to be able to order tacos with a side of french fries.  If this place was in Austin, TX I would eating here frequently!  Very fantastical! Deserves more than 5 stars."}
{"text":"Don't let the shabbiness of this place fool you! This is a true gem if you enjoy Mexican food. This place lives up to its great reviews when I came here it was a full house and the prices are reasonable. I ordered the chimichanga but to make it vegan I had them substitute the meat with vegetables and remove the cheese and sour cream . They were more than happy to accommodate my dietary needs which tells me this place makes their food fresh  ! If you haven't been here your missing out!!"}
{"text":"A hole in the wall with great food. Convenient to the airport and we have made it our go to place with arriving guests.  The service is adequate....  Not unfriendly,  but no smiles.  I tried.  Salsa is good, queso is great,  and the shrimp burritos are outstanding. The tacos are also good,  and the ground beef tacos are better than the chicken tacos."}
{"text":"I am so perplexed by Miguel's good reviews! This place is vile!   I don't mind divey, hole in the wall places. In fact, I kind of prefer them, but the food & service at Miguel's was horrible. The waitstaff looked miserable & acted as if it were a chore to take our order. The guacamole was thin & watery, chicken was burnt, the flavor of everything tasted just a little off. I can't think of a single good thing about my experience. Maybe they were just having an off day? It's possible. I'd be willing to give them a second chance if the service had been better, but not now."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the Charlotte area.  Small hole in the wall place. The food is full of flavor. Friendly service and great food, what else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Food was great . It was a full house with alot of Hurricane evacuees. . The service omg. . They barely said 2 words to us. And just threw the food in the table and ran away.  I know they were busy, but come on a little bit of hospitality never killed anyone..."}
{"text":"Holla!   This resteraunt continues to impress me. Rustic atmosphere that makes it feel just right. Pretty much what'd you think of when you think of Mexican food.   Portions are great, the beer is ice cold, and the prices are very reasonable. The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because the food is very basic. There isn't really anything that sets them on a much higher level from your other generic Mexican place.   I do however think they are better than your basic Mexican place.  Definitely worth going in and I intend to go back!"}
{"text":"Miguel's is a nice local spot right by the airport. It is a refreshing change to the chain options in the area and the food is incredible.   We were seated right away even during lunchtime and given chips and salsa right off the bat. The salsa came in a small carafe with a little bowl for each of us so we could have our own.   I ordered the chicken soup with was delicious. The broth had wonderful flavor and the ingredients were all fresh and flavorful. It was a nice lite lunch (there was a menu full of more filling options). Everything on the menu looked delicious. I'll be adding Miguel's to my list whenever I am making a lunchtime airport trip!  There is easy parking but it is a bit of a loop around the major roads so I'd recommend using GPS the first time you go."}
{"text":"I just can't figure out how this place gets such high reviews!  Been here twice and the experience was exactly the same. Crappy, unfriendly service and bland food at its most basic. Don't expect prompt service and good luck getting any staffers to smile. We sat outside in the rundown open air covered section. Not even sure what to call it lol!  This wasn't that bad, but when combined with the forgettable food and pathetic service that makes you feel like an interruption, it just isn't worth the stop. If you're looking for cheap, no frills food with a side of arrogance then you'll be satisfied. Otherwise try a different spot. There's no lack of Mexican fare in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Miguel's is great.  This may be difficult to locate for people that are randomly looking to stop somewhere, though.  The good is very good tasting tex/mex.  The service is just fine and attentive, I've not experienced any customer service issues here.  They have combos and affordable food if you want something cheap; otherwise there big entrees are good and still not a wallet buster.  I'd recommend this place to anyone on the west side or anyone making the trip South on I-85."}
{"text":"Really?  Read the reviews. Would have been almost enjoyable if there was service. Crabby server. She said total of five words. Got my order wrong. Avoid us like the plague. Ate what I could.  Worst burritos ever.  Runny beans. How do they stay in business?  Best part was sitting outside.  I am all for supporting local. But this place needs work."}
{"text":"Please don't let their dive-y appearance and deserted-motel surroundings deter you from eating here! This place is a gem.  Not only are the staff friendly, quick and on top of their game, but the food is FANTASTIC!! On Sundays I always order their vegetable fajita special: for only a few dollars you get a giant, sizzling plate of vegetables, rice and refried beans, and all the fajita fixings your heart desires. They also have endless chips and (what might be the best) salsa (in the world). Try their queso too, it's quite good.  Now that I live in Ballantyne, I rarely am able to trek to Miguel's but I dearly miss their food, great service and unbeatable prices."}
{"text":"By far. The best food all over! I never have to guess where to eat when in the area. The daily food specials and drink specials are consistent and posted on website. No frills and flashy gimmicks, just great food!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant around and I've tried almost all of them. Fajitas are out of this world. Not only do they come with the traditional onions and peppers, they also have grilled mushrooms, squash and zucchini! Yummy! Flautas are also delicious. Prices are too cheap for the quality and amount of food you get. Service is good, very friendly and fast. The only thing that may scare you away when you first visit is the appearance of the building. It is a hole in the wall, but a gem! Don't be swayed by the outside. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great Food, Fast Service! Don't let the looks scare you. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Mixed review: chips and salsa were good, atmosphere good. I was told by my party that the chicken was good in the enchilada. My food, vegetarian burrito/cheese enchilada combo, was really basic and had no imagination in flavor. I was hoping to get a taqueria style burrito but what I got was small and boring flavor. The guacamole was tasteless and frozen, previously made. It was shameful that they serve that. Outdoor seating option was cool and it was very popular."}
{"text":"Really delicious Mexican food! Granted the building looks sketchy from the outside, but the inside is clean and inviting. They have a great outdoor covered space which would be great to enjoy margaritas.   The shredded beef tacos were great. Usually tacos are smothered with sour cream, lettuce, and other filler that takes away from the meat, but not this place. The shredded beef was cooked to perfection and topped with the right amount of lettuce and shredded cheese. Not that gross yellow cheese, but the delicious white cheese that they use for quesadillas. Yum. However I do suggest if you order these for take-out you ask them to put the items separately so you can build-your-own when you get home. It was only a 5 minute drive from the restaurant back to my hotel room, and in that short amount of time, the hard taco shells had become soggy from the beef juices. Kind of a bummer.  I also got the shrimp fajitas. Lots of shrimp and brightly colored veggies, which they didn't cook to death like most Mexican places. It was also a nice surprise to see some zucchini mixed in there along with traditional fajita vegetables. Bummer though that they forgot to give me the tortillias, so they weren't really eaten as fajitas. The rice and beans side was okay, I wish the Mexican rice would have been a bit more interesting. It was definitely an afterthought. Their guacamole isn't fresh, but instead an overly smooth dip. Maybe I'm spoiled from recently visiting Mexico, but I didn't care for it.  Overall I would absolutely recommend going here especially if you have an overnight layover. If I could give it 4.5 stars I would, but I stuck with 4 stars because it's not quite 5."}
{"text":"Had a layover in Charlotte, hotel staff said come here....glad I listened.  Lunch special, DELISH!  Prices very good....staff was friendly and quick!  Would come again Ina minute!"}
{"text":"Total hidden treasure right here! Great post-hike/other strenuous activity food place. Food is so delicious and affordable. The chips and salsa - I have to watch myself or I eat too much before my actual meal comes, so tasty. It's a hole in the wall type of place, so not much to look at, but the service is friendly. And you might miss it using the address in Google Maps, it's just past where maps tells you the place is on the right.   Seriously, if you're ever in the area, def hit up Miguel's!"}
{"text":"Good, fast, clean Mexican food.  Don't let the appearance of the building dissuade you.  If you are staying at one of the airport hotels, stop in for some fajitas.  Oh and the prices can't be beat."}
{"text":"I have been to Miguel's many time in the last 5 years.  It is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants, period.  Best dish is the enchiladas verde.   Good iced tea and beer.  Chips are only OK, but salsa is excellent.I generally do not trust Mexican restaurants that do not have cracked vinyl seats and fuzzy paintings on the wall, but I will make an exception for this place.  It only has cracked vinyl seats.  Don't go here for atmosphere; it looks like an old drive-in Sonic Burger from the 60's."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican carnitas, they were delicious. However, it was HOT in the building. You might want to wait till the sun is down and sit outside in their patio area. Give them a try if you are in the area. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had a combo plate of taco, enchilada & chili relleno. I called them back since I had what seemed like 2 enchiladas (the \"burrito\" was exactly like an enchilada) and the other third of the plate looked like melted cheese, meat and beans. To my disappointment that melted blob was my \"chili relleno\".  By most definitions (and the fact that I worked as a prep cook in A Mexican restaurant), a chili relleno is a pepper stuffed with cheese and various other things.  The gent on the phone said the recipe varies in Mexico, but I disagree because of the word CHILE on the menu!  The gent told me he would make it right and I appreciate that, but please take the word \"chile\" off the menu description. Extra star for them offering to make it right."}
{"text":"The reviews have been very generous. I eat Mexican food quite often at different places. I had fajitas here at Miguel's and I can't say it was top 5. It wasn't bad, don't get me wrong. But wasn't a 4.5 like everyone else is saying. Good salsa, average service. Like I said it's not bad. But it's not overwhelming."}
{"text":"Great little place near airport. Excellent food, beer, margaritas and daily specials. A find on this area"}
{"text":"Had the josephina special for dinner last night and it was great! Loved the free chips and salsa with the meal too!"}
{"text":"Like another said I almost didn't stop. Was on the way to catch a flight it of town. Glad I did stop. The food is full of flavor and very tasty. I will come back next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Just checked out this restaurant.  I had the Sunday Special (Fajitas).  The food was ok, but my waitress was not friendly at all.  Don't know if she was over worked or what, but she acted as if she didn't want to be bothered. I probably won't go again.  Not even a thank you as I exited!!  Whatever! Just RUDE!!"}
{"text":"I truly don't think this place is all that great, definitely not 4 Stars like it shows on Yelp. To start-the chips and salsa are no bueno. The food is super average, and the staff is the least friendly. They gave me the wrong order (which is ok mistakes happen) but when I politely brought it up they got mad at me and told me that it is in fact what I ordered. I'm sorry but a Chile Relleno and a tostada are not the same thing."}
{"text":"Excellent 'Dive-Mex'.  Easy to eat lunch for  less than $5.  Plenty of outdoor seating when the weather is warm"}
{"text":"By luck I found this great little Mexican Rest . Do not let the outside appearance scare you away . The fajitas were outstanding . I sat at the bar , was served very quickly . The beer and drinks are very reasonable as well !  The menu is quite extensive and offers something for everyone ."}
{"text":"Very good and also reasonably priced. Small divey place with really good fajitas. My friend got the cheese and said it was really good too.   The place has indoor and outdoors."}
{"text":"Back at favorite spots! Don't let the appearance of the place discourage you really great food!"}
{"text":"We almost didn't stop here just because of how bad it looked but we decided to take a chance.  It was actually really good and very cheap.    Definitely worth the money!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Miguel's I ordered the fajita plate. That was pretty good. The second time I brought my wife and we ordered the special Steak Burrito plate. We also ordered guacamole on the side. Nothing was authentic and nothing was fresh. The steak was like the Philly cheese steak you would get from a frozen box and the guacamole was definitely not fresh avocado. The chips and salsa... chips were made fresh as they were still warm and salsa could be freshly made but not sure. I was disappointed the second time. Not sure if I would go back. I can make better Mexican food than this place."}
{"text":"Just moved from FL and we had a favorite Mexican restaurant.  We have tried 3-4 before we tried this place.  We arrived and it was busy.  Got a seat and then we ordered a pitcher of Texas margaritas witch were good not as good as our old place in FL but ok.   The food arrived and it was delicious.  I got the Miguel's fajitas and my husband got the choripollo.  He said it was better than our old place.  I loved the flavor of the fajitas.  Place is not fancy but if you want good food it's the best we have found yet.  People sitting outside to eat in 48 degree weather.  That should tell you something. We will be back."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Ordered the tostada de ceviche and the shrimp tasted frozen as if the shrimps didn't thaw in time.  Was not please with that but the spouse ordered tacos and it was delicious.  Their salsa was really good one of the best I had and their spicy salsa that came with the tacos had the right amount of kick to it.  I don't know if it was the owner or not but saw him refill someone's chip basket with his bare hands.  While the other ladies wore gloves while filling the chip basket. That was a no no on his part.  Ordered a spaghetti kids order to go for my son and he loved it!  I also tried it and it was one of the best spaghetti I had."}
{"text":"I've been to Miguel's over 10 times. I always take family and friends when they are in town. Everyone has always been super impressed. The food is always delicious. Service is OK, but not terrible. They always do their best to accommodate their customers, granted they are always slammed. My go to is ACP with black beans. Their queso and margaritas are a must!"}
{"text":"Awesome very authentic.  Dive. Old school independent. Guacamole excellent. Fajitas had everything right.  Salsa perfection"}
{"text":"Food is awesome, service is crap.  Couldn't care less, I still love this place.  Get the tacos al pastor and the Texas Rita. Also the scream cheese is banging."}
{"text":"I don't really see a problem with the ambiance.  It's a little hole in the wall place, and that's exactly what it reflects.  The patio area is actually pretty cool, but we sat inside.  The salsa was some of the best I've ever had, the drink specials were top notch, and the food was delicious as well.    I wish I could elaborate more, but trust me, the place is awesome."}
{"text":"Tried the restaurant for dinner. Food was good and pretty authentic Mexican food. Prices were very reasonable and beer was cold. $2.50 for a draft beer is a great price. Had the fajitas and they were certainly acceptable. Limited beans, rice, guacamole and sour cream though. Worth a stop if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Authentic and wonderful!  Everytime I've been here I've loved it & brought new friends.  Don't judge this book by its cover - it's not in the prettiest location but the food... it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food! I called in an order to take back to my hotel room. Affordable, local, delicious! Decent amount of vegetarian options. Was pleasantly surprised to find chips and salsa in my bag as an added bonus! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Walking distance (right next door) to the Wingate, and there's a nice outdoor seating area.  I had the carnitas.  It was a little overcooked, but the flavor was good.  Service was so-so, I'd go back if I have a lot of time to eat, but not for a quick trip."}
{"text":"I have been to this wonderful hole in the wall restaurant so so many times. The food is ALWAYS on point and the price is even better. The very first time I was brought here, by my best friend, I expected to be disappointed. Simply for the fact that it is so run down. It is a very small building with limited seating. They also have tables outside. But I'm a loyal customer now. They staff is friendly. The food comes out hot AND delicious (EVERY SINGLE TIME). They make a bomb mango margarita. My best friend and I call this \"our spot\". About a month ago, the boo was in town and he pulled up Miguels without my suggestion. He asked me about the place and without hesitation I said, \"Let's go!\" He was also impressed by this place. You definitely CANNOT go wrong here. Much love to all the wonderful people who work here and create such great food!! And of course, I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! So authentic! I got El combo & everything tasted good. I was so full but, didn't feel like stop eating!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all- would definitely not recommend wasting your money. Bland seasoning- presentation was sloppy. Hate to say it but I would rather eat at taco bell. So disappointed..."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow even in the evening. Took hubby for the first time. Monday night special $5.99 3 enchiladas w rice. $2.99 Small Margaritas Pork torta added chorizo added.  $8.50"}
{"text":"Good food and service.  I had the Taco de Azada and they were very good. The beef was tender and flavorful. The margarita was ok, but was overly sweet.  Really good value overall and I would return."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is cozy which is nice. The staff really doesn't smile much if at all. The rice is kind of bland, especially for a Mexican place. The refried beans are almost puree. The chips come out warm and the salsa is fresh but once again, almost seems pureed (a chunkier, more homestyle would be better).    The tacos were really good. But the enchiladas seemed odd. The sauce was brown instead of reddish like I'd expected and there was no cheese on top at all. The tortilla seemed like it had  been fixed for awhile. The soapapilla dessert was tasty.    Overall, the meal was a mixed bag. Blackened anything (fish, etc.) here is excellent though."}
{"text":"This place is legit!! Delicious, plentiful, inexpensive food and crazy cheap Dos Equis big beers on tap. My friend had the combo fajitas and I had the poblanos. Fajitas very well prepared but my stuff was just ridiculous. Large seared poblano peppers stuffed w ground beef and cheese then lightly battered and flash fried. Tasty red sauce with standard rice and beans. Served w homemade tortillas and was just delicious. Muy sabroso! Highly recommend this place. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went here tonight as it is across the street from my hotel. 4 stars with over 200 reviews can't be bad. At first glance this might not look like a place you would want check out, but it was definitely worth it.  This is a small restaurant with additional outdoor seating available.  A very unique layout and it was jam packed. The menu has a wide variety of items and is very reasonably priced on both food and beer. I had beef enchiladas and a chicken quesadilla. Both were good and what I expect from a Mexican restaurant. Nothing fancy but filled me up. I will be back next time I am staying by the Charlotte airport."}
{"text":"Don't be afraid by the exterior! Lunch date here with my co-workers after our weekly meeting. First off...I really should have gps'ed the address because this place off the beaten path...or maybe too beaten. It's actually on an I-85 service road nestled between a chain hotel and an old motel. I must say I was a wee bit concerned when I got out of the car. But it was all good when I got inside.  I ordered the Quesadilla Rellino (sp) and a side order of guacamole. Of course the guac came out first and maybe its because I make a mean guacamole but this was a watered down avocado mousse with very little seasoning. I had to ask for a lime and shake some s&p before I could convince myself to eat it. Not okay!! My quesadilla however was awesome!! The chicken was seasoned so perfectly, I really could have eaten buckets of it. Overall, I will definitely try this place again san guacamole."}
{"text":"Not the fanciest looking place. Not by a long shot. Heck, this might even have a ways to go to be one of the worst looking places. But don't let that fool you - if you can find your way there (go to the light past the Hardee's, around the bend and back again), park where you can, and pull up a seat.  There is no tender loving care here. While the staff gets things done, they do not take the time to coddle you, because it's fast and furious like Vin Diesel is coming to town. There is no time for that sort of thing, since they are all business here. That does not mean they are not friendly, just that you may be disappointed if you want to be treated gently is all.  If you're up for a mild adventure, however, this is the place to be - the after those servers come at you, the food is not far behind, and it is generally excellent. To make things even better, it's not pricey. On Sundays you can even get their lunch fajitas for just five bucks. Yep, five bucks. Nice. Just make sure you arrive early, because despite looking like a hole in the wall, and being a slight challenge to find, this place gets busy at times."}
{"text":"I came here because I saw all the rave reviews. It's definitely a hidden gem. Don't be scared of the interior and exterior.The food is cheap. The salsa is good. The food was good and you get it very quickly! The only thing I didn't like was the service. Our server was slow and they weren't even that busy. There was one time where I asked him for something and he kept walking off without stopping or looking. I thought he didn't hear me but he did end up bringing what I asked for. We also had to ask for refill drinks. Maybe it was an off night because the other servers were pretty attentive to their tables."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Charlotte. Big portions. Just an all around solid restarting with great staff and great food!"}
{"text":"Just a simple fajita dinner tonight. These tortillas were fried though, which is a bit different. Spot looks a little run down and ghetto, but food and atmosphere is decent."}
{"text":"As noted in other reviews, this place is NOT going to give you the warm and fuzzy.  That's not at all what they are about.  What they ARE about, however, is excellent non-chain Mexican food at a fantastic price.  Food:  The tortilla chips are mad fresh.  Yum.  Salsa is milder with great flavor and smooth texture.  Double yum.  I had the steak fajitas - it was a tremendous amount of food for one person.  Did I mention the fantastic price?  Paired that with a draft Dos Equis and called it a meal.  Service:  All business.  Seating occurred quickly with minimal interaction - they aren't interested in doling out the feel goods.  They want you to order quickly and accurately - this can be challenging as the menu is quite extensive.  I read the other interviews and didn't even try for a drink refill; just ordered a huge beer to tide me over instead."}
{"text":"First time, great experience.  Went with our family of 6 and thoroughly enjoyed it. The queso was delicious, tacos & burritos were great, and chips/salsa were spot on.  Loved the environment & atmosphere- it's small, but legit. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I remember the first time I ate here. It was near my best friend's home, and a huge group of us went one day. I wasn't an adventurous eater then, so I ordered something that looked pretty tame. I had the nacho cheese burritos, with chicken. That was in 2001 and for the past 12 years I have ordered the same thing every time I visit.   There is a short list of \"must visit\" places every time we go home, and Miguel's is #1 on that list. When you pull into their gravel parking lot, look past the outside of the building and it's location. When you get inside, look past the decor & the cracked, red vinyl booths. Take a seat (there is no host/hostess, just sit where you want), dive in to the chips and salsa (I could eat their salsa with a spoon!) and get ready to enjoy a truly delicious meal.   This visit Graham & I both began our meal with a margarita. We were heading to a movie after dinner, so I got a small one. If you're not going to sit through a three hour, really depressing musical (Les Miserables... really good, though) order a pitcher. They had them on special that night and it the pitcher was cheaper than what we spent on the drinks we ordered. Graham thought his was weak, and ordered an extra shot of tequila, I thought mine was perfect.   We devoured two baskets of chips and salsa while waiting for our meal. Finally, it arrived. We were starving, and of course this was the one time that the service was slow. But our food came out and it was worth the wait. I know the burritos don't look like much... but oh baby.  The cheese sauce is absolutely delicious, and the inside of the burrito is stuffed with huge chunks of chicken, bell peppers, tomatoes & onions. Every single bite is delicious. I was craving some black beans too, so I ordered a dish on the side. Black beans are usually pretty bland at most restaurants, and these were too. But a spoonful of the delicious salsa and some salt worked wonders.   Graham is a little more diverse in his meal selections than I am. I find something I like, and I tend to stick with it. He typically gets something different each time. This time he ordered the Enchiladas De Chorizo. This was excellent. The chorizo was perfectly cooked and really flavorful.   Miguel's is truly on my list of my favorite restaurants of all time. The food is delicious, the service is quick and the staff is always pleasant. The same people have worked there forever, and back when I still lived in Charlotte and ate there every week, my server would bring me a sweet tea without even asking. And the price absolutely can not be beat. Dinner, margaritas & tip cost us about $42.   Three enchiladas filled with Mexican sausage, covered with shredded cheddar cheese & green sauce. Served with rice, lettuce & pico de gallo."}
{"text":"DO NOT LET THE APPEARANCE DETER YOU! This little hole in the wall was amazing!!!! Food was excellent, huge portions and served very quickly! I have never seen a Mexican place put squash and zucchini in fajitas but it was amazing! Enough food from my one order of fajitas to feed me and my daughter and still take some home.... my friend had the steak and cheese burritos he said they were great! The waiter was great, very friendly and kept us happy the whole time! We enjoyed the patio, sunset was beautiful and watching the planes fly in and out was nice. The first night here we were going to try this place but didn't because it looks a little sketchy but man I'm so glad we went back tonight! Best food experience I've had our entire time in Charlotte! I will definitely return here whenever I'm in town!"}
{"text":"One word: obsessed. One part hidden gem, one part dive bar, all parts freaking awesome.   Miguel's is definitely off the beaten path: it's about two miles from the airport off Little Rock Road on the service road. It doesn't look like much. It's small random house next to the Wingate Hotel. They have a cool outdoor covered seating area as well.   They have $4.25 lunch specials every day. On Sundays, there's a $4.99 fajitas lunch specials. They also have drinks specials every night as well as dinner specials that start as low as $5.99. Don't mind me, I'm the girl who gets a lunch chimichanga AND a chile relleno on the side (while consuming an entire basket of chips).   Note: Chips and salsa are free if you are dining in, there is a charge for to-go orders. It's worth it, the salsa is homemade and delicious.   They do take credit cards. The place is small, so take that into consideration when making lunch or dinner plans. Tonya and I went yesterday at 11:30am and it was the perfect time."}
{"text":"Went to Miguel's when our flight was cancelled and the airline booked us at a nearby hotel. The restaurant was busy and cramped because it was coo cold for the outside tables to be open. Plus it was a Saturday night. Service was fast and efficient. I definitely recommend getting to soup. Very yummy, rich broth. All of our meals were very good. We enjoyed a pitcher of margaritas and very large beers as well. Definitely recommend trying this spot if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall Mexican joint. Good food, cheap, clean little restaurant that was built from a home."}
{"text":"The service here is great, they are very attentive to our needs. The restaurant was packed for dinner last night. Margaritas were tasty and on special! $7.99 for a half pitcher. Food was hot and tasty. I had the chimichanga which is offered soft instead of fried if you want. Charlotte style was different as only the meat was inside. The beans, cheese, sour cream and lettuce and guacamole are on top/side. My sis had enchilada and a burrito special which was wonderful. Rice and beans on the side.  Great place and I would definitely recommend if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food, it's a little hole in the wall place which makes it even better!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was an early teen I'm now 23 omg I love this place so very authentic delicious. I don't go for the service or the ambiance lol but don't judge a book by it's cover this place is delicious! definitely in my top 5 favorite places to go in all of Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Great food close to the airport.  Found it on yelp and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall Mexican restaurant! Don't let the building or decor send you away. The food is really good. You can also dime inside or outside. Friendly staff and quick service."}
{"text":"This a a quinsential hole in the wall. But the food is really really goid, as are the beers."}
{"text":"Mexican food was the last thing on my mind for my first dinner as a newbie NC transplant from San Diego, CA. SD has great Mexican food (no surprise as Mexico is 25 minutes to the south.)  Yet, once again I am saved by the Yelpers. I arrive NC exhausted from flights with delays. All I want is food. This was 5 min from my airport hotel.   The chimichangas had moist, tender chicken with onions and peppers. The tortillas had a nice delicate crunch and savor under a generous helping of guacamole and sour cream. The refried beans were earthy. And the chips and salsa were as everyone says - great.  Nothing I like more than a local hole in the wall with yummy good. Great value too. Service was a bit indifferent for me - otherwise the food is 5 stars."}
{"text":"As everyone else has pointed out already, this place is not much to look at.  HOWEVER, just because they don't spend their hard earned cash on decorum, doesn't mean that they don't keep this place clean.  I am not a neat freak, but I was pleasently surprised/satisfied with the cleanliness of this place.  So don't worry about coming hear for sanitary reasons.  As for the most important part - the food.  The food is delicious - classic authentic mexican - can't go wrong here.  It's also outrageously cheap.  I was hear on my company's dime so it didn't matter.  I went all out and the bill still came to under $10 for lunch.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If you are not concerned with the ambiance, this place is AWESOME!! We sat outside in a room that had no windows - but it somehow fit the restaurant nonetheless. There is a place to sit indoors as well, but we were there on a perfect evening temperature-wise. The prices of the drinks ($3.25 for a 32 oz beer!!) as well as the food itself could not be beat. My husband and I enjoyed authentic Mexican cuisine at ridiculously low prices. Would definitely visit again if we were in the area."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on Yelp, while staying at a hotel nearby, I went to Miguel's. The service was slow. I asked three times for hot sauce or salsa (the salsa served with the chips was bland; I like my food to have some attitude) and never got any. My mushroom quesadilla was OK but nothing to write home about. My recommendation is, if you're driving by and are hungry, sure, go ahead and eat here, but it's not worth coming here if you're not already in the vicinity."}
{"text":"This place is authentic as I have seen in charlotte. We have tried at-least 6 Other Mexican places and so far this is the best. Salsa was really good just a little spice but not so much you can't eat. The chorizo cheese dip was awesome. I got chicken chimichanga and were pretty good. They use shredded chicken but it actually had flavor as was cooked with onions and peppers. My husband got a pork dish and really enjoyed it. He suggested the homemade hot sauce. We topped it off with sopilla which you can't go wrong! Overall was good food. I gave 4 stars because even though service was quick the waiter was not very helpful when we asked for suggestions, just kept saying everything is good. But for a little mom and pop type place not too surprised.  We will return to try more."}
{"text":"Great food at screamingly reasonable prices.  Authentic cuisine with zero pretense.  It's the place I bring friends to when they come in from out of town because I know they'll love it."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Mexican food. Looks a bit sketchy, but don't let the exterior fool you. It's a nice little join with great food, awesome margaritas, and good service. Check it out."}
{"text":"Traveling for work and was famished as I landed in Charlotte. A quick yelp search suggested this restaurant and I thought I would give it a try.  I'm all for dive bars and restaurants but this place, located on what looks like a forgotten access road, had me saying, \"no no no...\" as I pulled in; I couldn't decide which was worse - the restaurant or the derelict motel next to it.  I was just about to pull out and figure out a plan B when I decided to throw in the park and take another look at the reviews; the restaurant received four out of five stars from nearly 100 diners, many of whom acknowledged that potential customers shouldn't let the aesthetics scare them off.  So glad I trusted these 100 strangers...what an amazing, flavorful meal! If I lived in Charlotte, I would be a regular.   My only bit of criticism is that I thought the staff could've been a little warmer but, hey, when your food is this good, you know people are going to come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  I've been coming here since I found out about it from an airport employee 8 years ago.  Always consistently good!"}
{"text":"Ahhhh Cinco de Mayo! A great holiday. When I read the reviews here I was pretty excited to try it. I pulled up and immediately thought \"what did I get myself into?\" Lol!! I promise it's wonderful, so go in. The outside is nothing to look at, I would normally pass by and not give it another thought. I'm glad I gave it a chance.  The menu is huge. They have daily specials, even on the weekends, which is fantastic. I ordered a cheese quesadilla, beef tostada, and of course chips and salsa was served with it. The hound beef on the tostada was absolutely delicious. It tasted like it had marinated all day in a broth. Very, very good...and I'm NOT a meat person. I have a feeling I will be craving this place again soon.  One start off for the waitresses was not happy or friendly at all.  Maybe she was busy, I don't know, but I wished she would've been nicer.  She did work hard, so I will write it off."}
{"text":"This place is definitely unassuming, and somewhere you'd just drive by....if you can even find it nestled next to the Wingate hotel, but don't let the appearance or location stop you from coming in! It is definitely my husband's and my favorite \"dive\" Mexican spot. It's absolutely no frills, but the food is cheap (and tasty) and the beer is cold!   There are combination platters to try a little of everything, which is what I did, but there's also specialities and deals of the day. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but I definitely recommend starting with either the guacamole or the scream cheese! It's definitely a gem in the rough in the charlotte food scene that's worth a nibble or two!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican places in Charlotte, but doesn't look like much from the outside.  While it is in an odd location, the food is awesome and inexpensive.  Everything I have had here had tons of flavor.  The service was simple and fast.  It is a great lunch spot.  Go here.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Miguel's is an institution in West Charlotte. Some of the best Mexican and Tex/Mex I've had. Like a lot of other people have mentioned, don't let the exterior deter you from going in. The place is not much bigger than a double wide trailer (not counting the large covered patio) but what they lack in size and decor they more than make up in food and drinks. The food is plentiful and tasty and their lunch menu is just the right size. Speaking of lunch, if you get there right as they are opening (11am-ish) you can get in, eat, and get out in under 30 minutes. Not a lot of places can say that. Oh, and did I mention the margaritas are huge and outstanding!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is so highly rated. Stopped here for a quick dinner on the way to the airport and got burritos tipicos and enchiladas supreme. Food was straightforward and not much thought given to presentation, which is usually ok by me if the flavor wows. But the flavors were just ok, mostly salty.   The burritos were piping hot and cheesy and satisfying without being overly complex. They came with a pool of salty refried beaks and a side of shredded iceberg with a dollop of overly salty guac billed together as \"guacamole salad.\" The enchiladas were barely warm and covered not with gooey cheesy sauce as usual, but with shredded lettuce and sour cream, which made everything soggy and cold.   The menu is huge so perhaps other items are much tastier but what's the point of a huge menu if you can't do all the items well? In sum, I've had much better Mexican even at this price point but I guess if you have to grab a bite in this area you could do worse than this place. The open breezeway seating is a bonus, as you can watch planes come in for landing close overhead."}
{"text":"I don't give out 5 stars. But this is a little gem. It's not TexMex and its not a taco shop its a Mexican restaurant.  As in Mexico it does not look good from the outside, in fact if it was not for yelp I would have driven right by the place. Food is great service is good.  My one note would be the portions are too big!! Yes they gave a full bar. If this was anywhere near where I live I would have my own table. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Don't expect good service or bringing a pretentious date because that's not the goal. What you will get is really good Mexican food in clt."}
{"text":"EDIT: I've been back twice since my first visit. Neither return trip repeated the first experience. I feel let down after getting excited about a decent place close to my office. Poor service and bland food are the norm here.  Good food for the price. I'm from OKC (with a lot of good Mexican and Tex-Mex food) and this place would stand up in the fierce competition of that market. I'm definitely going back.   My only complaint is the chips and salsa. Salsa was bland except for LOTS of salt. Chips were kind of mediocre as well. But these are minor compared to the great food I had."}
{"text":"A true dive on the end of an access road and also on the end of an old motor lodge. While the lodge may be dead, This little joint is alive! I had under an hour to get to the airport and had the choripollo dinner. Delicious breast topped with chrorizo and cheese. Coronas are ice cold. Service is team oriented.  My kinda place!"}
{"text":"Miguel's has all the things I like:  delicious food, good drinks and candy!  The servers are courteous, but tend to work fast and you tend to have multiple people waiting on you, so you don't really get attached to any particular one... One guy brought us the complimentary chips and salsa (which was delicious! The chips were hot and perfectly salted.  The salsa tasted fresh with a really nice kick to it.).  A lady came to take our drink orders and brought them back to take orders and a different guy brought our food out... All of them were nice, but I have no idea what their names are...   The margaritas are definitely worth a taste, if that's your thing... The medium is the size of a Presidente from Chili's, for comparision's sake...  So the large is an investment... lol    They have a number of specials for lunch and dinner... My favorite is the beef burrito with rice and beans... It's perfect for a light lunch, but still filling...  So, I'ma go ahead and tell you: this place looks sketch as hell, but put that aside... This is one of those things about not judging a book and blah, blah... The inside is clean, the food is super tasty, the specials are great, they sell old school penny candy at the register and the drinks are good... What more do you want?"}
{"text":"Good family run Mexican diner right next to Charlotte airport. If you are staying at one of the nearby hotels, there are not many food options nearby, but Miguel's is a good place to check out. Good chips and salsa, tacos, and enchiladas. I also tried the chicken soup, which was good but wish the broth was hot (was served Luke warm). Very affordable prices and cute family run venue. Would return if staying at one of the nearby hotels."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden GEM !   DONT let outside appearance shoo you away !  This place has the most authentic Mexican food in Charlotte with more than reasonable prices.  Everyday they have lunch and dinner specials.  Don't let other \" Mexican\"  restaurants fool you with a fancy place and \" authentic\" dishes with overpriced dishes !  You want the true taste of MEXICO ?  Then look no further."}
{"text":"Great food, poor service. The best Mexican food I have found around Charlotte so far. Super tiny place. Don't expect anyone to greet you at the door. Also if you don't get the waitresses attention for stuff that you need you probably will never get it. And when you asked for it most likely she's going to be unhappy that she had to do something else for you. I don't really care how good the food is for service is horrible I won't be back."}
{"text":"Service is terrible. Not even busy when we were there.  This is by far the worst Mexican restaurant I have ever eaten at in my entire life. The restaurant itself was dirty hot and smelly.  The wait staff was rude and acted like they were pissed that we showed up.  We ended up eating outside and the table was filthy. My order was wrong, I asked for soft tacos and got crunchy.  The shrimp that my wife ordered were so over cooked they were almost black and completely dry, not to mention they weren't deveined, gross. We had six people in our party and everyone's dinner came out in rounds, about five minutes apart and the kids got theirs last. When we finally had enough we  asked for the check. About five minutes after that the drinks that we had ordered halfway through dinner finally showed up, but we decided not to drink them.  We had to chase down the rudest server on the planet to pay for our horrible dinner and I've never been so glad to leave a restaurant my entire life. Everything about it was terrible. Do not go there. Even if the hotel that you're staying at recommends them, don't fall for it."}
{"text":"It was okay. Good chips and salsa, but the entrees and $18 pitcher of margarita were definitely lacking."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight after reading the reviews. We went in very optimistic. We first tried sitting outside but their were wasps swarming in the ceiling. Food was greasy. Salsa was just okay. And, they make their enchiladas with white cheese which is not authentic Mexican. Guacamole was instant. Staff was not friendly. Will not return."}
{"text":"So, I decided I  wanted mexian and didn't want drive to my favorite spot in Azteca. I found this place about 8 minutes from me and decided to give it a try. I was very skeptical about the location but said why not.  I'm pleasantly surprised, I had the spinach enchilada and added chicken. It was good and well seasoned. I also got chips on the side which were goid as well. Would definitely try again."}
{"text":"First time, and very impressed. Food was excellent, service great, staff friendly, the only thing holding it back from a five is the facility. Think 50's rundown diner meets 21st century Mexican restaurant.   Regardless, I will be back for the food!"}
{"text":"I love Miguel's. It's not fancy but the food is really good. You could miss this place easily if you weren't looking for it. But do look for it, you'll be glad you did. When you walk in, you feel like you're walking in to someone's home kitchen. There is a choice of indoor or outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is in a little open air structure, so you are still out of the elements if it's raining or if the sun is beating down in the summertime. The menu has a lot to offer, I usually get tacos and rice and beans, while my fella usually gets jalapeno poppers and a veggie quesadilla. There are also American choices on the menu. Portion sizes are generous. The police in the area seem to really like eating here, there is almost always an officer dining when we go there. That tells me 3 things, Miguel's treats our officers right, the food is really good and a good value, and I will be safe eating at this establishment. Service is always friendly. I wish Miguel's would come to Raleigh."}
{"text":"Wow... The best Mexican restaurant in the country.    My advise to you making a connection in Charlotte airport.   Take the lastest contraction, take a cab here for lunch or dinner than go back to the airport.  It's worth the layover.    It's 5 minutes from the airport."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp while staying in a hotel near by. It's tucked into a corner and doesn't look like much but the food was great! I'm super picky with my salsa and it was so good! We had 6 in our group and we all liked what we had. Started with their special dip, with ground beef and queso, it was yummy and good sized. I ordered the lunch chicken fajitas for $6.95 with a side of sliced avocado for  $1. There wasn't that much chicken but it was actually the perfect amount for 2 good sized tortillas to fill! It came with the usual grilled onions and bell peppers but also grilled squash, zucchini and tomatoes with a side of beans, rice, sour cream and pico. They did serve alcohol but non of us had any. Also you can ask for hot sauces! Overall it was excellent and I'd definitely go again if I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican I have had in a LONG time. What a relief to find a little nostalgia - a happy sanctuary from the business traveler's restaurant chain doldrums. Atmosphere offers off the beaten path food experience melding old school diner and Bordertown Mexican.   Grab a chrome stool at the counter/bar or slip into a red leather booth and dig your way through authentic south of the border cuisine while checking out the wall décor. The building is interestingly quirky- open-air outside dining room roofed but likely too hot unless there is a nice breeze. Inside for the dining room or full bar. I went ala carte with a beef taco, chicken quesadilla, and chicken tostada (so hard to find good tostadas; the chicken was perfect blend of chunks and pulled - no gristle).   Great service coupled with great location adjacent Charlotte Douglas International Airport. Oh, and the prices are ridiculously low. Try something different and check it out!!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's a hole-in-the-wall and hard to get to.  It's also fantastic food at a great price.  I will definitely go back.  The Serrano Dinner was fantastic."}
{"text":"So, having read some recent reviews, and being a Mexican fan, I had to get to Miguel's. Sunday's Lunch Special, Fajitas for $4.99. I arrived a little before 12 and the place was already crowded and by 12:30 every table was full. The servers were friendly and chips and salsa arrived immediately upon being seated. Although the salsa was a little smooth for my taste it had great flavor and the chips were good too! The fajitas arrived fresh and steaming, they were served with tortillas, sour cream, pico, and rice and beans. I chose the chicken, with included onions, peppers, mushrooms, and zucchini, and a great portion size...especially for the price.   Even though the look of the restaurant is not what you would expect, it is worth a visit..and I know I will be back on Sunday when I have a fajita craving :-)."}
{"text":"All I'm going to say is this little o'l place has great food. I'm from the south in Texas and I have ate a lot of Mexican food in my days. This place is a diamond in the rough! Don't judge a book by its cover. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Being near my office, we frequent this place for lunch.   Service: outstanding. Always fast and friendly, with bottomless chips and salsa that actually get refilled.  Food: the food is standard Mexican fare, done simple and well. While you won't find anything truly amazing, everything I've tried has been delicious, well thought out, and ready quickly.  Value: this is where they truly shine. The prices are unbeatable for what you get, and the daily special gets you out the door for about $6, without leaving you hungry. Try whatever is on special that day if you aren't sure, and chances are you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"The al pastor tacos were SO delicious!!  Awesome food with great prices. I'll definitely come back if I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I'm so sad to say that we had a terrible experience at our first trips to Miguel's. Firstly, I will admit that we went on Cinco de Mayo, so I understand that it was crowded and crazy. However, it was so disappointing that a Mexican restaurant could be so incredibly underprepared on a night when they know lots of customers would be coming.   Firstly, we were not greeted at all. In fact, when we walked in, it was so crowded and there was nowhere to stand, but there was no one to direct us or let us know how to get a table. Eventually, we decided to sit outside, and I believe we sat ourselves. A waitress came to get our drink orders, and those came out fine. Our waiter then switched. We ordered some queso and our entrees, while we ate chips. Eventually the chips ran out and we asked for more. The chips never came and neither did our queso appetizer.   Finally (after a VERY long time -- meanwhile, no drink refills or anything), our entrees come out. The food was mediocre. It was clearly cooked in a rushed manner...unfortunately, it was just like blobs on a plate.   Our waiter was so inattentive and everything felt so chaotic. We did not feel welcomed.  When the waiter came to give us our checks, we asked him if he could remove the queso since we never received it. All he said was \"I already took it off\" with no apology. We are fairly certain that, had we not mentioned it, he never would have acknowledged that we did not receive it.   Needless to say, we will not be returning. Even if there is hope for a less crowded experience. The hunt for a great Mexican restaurant continues."}
{"text":"This is truly a hidden gem and if your aren't paying attention might miss it. Pulling up to it I just knew the food was going to be good. There's an outside patio around that you walk into then the door. We just grabbed a sit & a server come and gave us a menu. There's a lot on the menu so it took me awhile to decide but went with my favorite which are nachos and they were so good and it's a really good portion. The margaritas were nice are strong. The serve wasn't bad just straight to the point and we didn't have to wait too long for our food or drinks."}
{"text":"Prompt service and fantastic food.  Not pretty from the gravel lot, but well worth the trip inside.  Just ignore the mediocre salsa and chips as they are not an appropriate prelude to the main course."}
{"text":"I live in Southern California. I have been back twice. I really like miguels. It's not fancy and it's in a strange location but worth it."}
{"text":"great food, scary looking building and kinda sketchy area but great food! :)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a true Mexican feel, this is the place for you. The decor is a bit challenged, but the food is just okay. It's a great place for a quick bite. Service was functional, but not friendly at all."}
{"text":"Very solid dinner and drinks at Miguel's! Doesn't look like a lot, but is a good place."}
{"text":"enjoyed my Mexicano Burrito with great tasking pork, kitchen filled with smoke too as I walked into the dining room. The police eat there too."}
{"text":"I would have never waked into this placE without the reviews from Yelp and man am I glad I did. Great food served up in a shed. Will return."}
{"text":"This place is just not very good. They use pre made taco shells! You may as well pick up some shells from Taco Bell! It's just not authentic at all.  The servers are not friendly.  Tried it twice - will not be back."}
{"text":"The place is old and run down but I don't mind if the food is good.  The chips were average and it took so long to get served, the chips were the appetizer.   The service was below par.  I speak Spanish and even speaking in Spanish didn't help.   The chimichangas were average and the chicken soft tacos were so salty, I couldn't taste anything else.   Come on Miguel, salt is a flavor enhancer that should bring out and enhance the flavors, not completely over power them.   The out door seating is in an enclosed space that has no windows, just cut outs.  It was so hot and uncomfortable.   They need fans to get the air moving in there. Sorry but I can't honestly say anything good."}
{"text":"Great spot! You wouldn't think it was something special when you drove up. But it was perfect. So close to the airport which was convenient. Food was really good."}
