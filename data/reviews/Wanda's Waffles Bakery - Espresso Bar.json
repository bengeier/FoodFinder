{"text":"Love their crepes and waffles. Good service and comfortable place to hang out in. There's a lot of competition in this plaza but I think it's worth a try."}
{"text":"I've heard people talk about Wanda's waffle over the years and I was excited to hear there was a location in Richmond hill. I was extremely disappointed. I was expecting the waffle to be light & soft but instead it was so hard that it was almost Too hard to saw through w/ the plastic knife.  I saw the girl who made the waffle bring out a ball of batter by hand from the fridge  (the batter was not in a liquid form??).  And the ice cream was nothing to scream for either. I tried a few flavours had to choose the best of the worst). The staff was friendly but was not knowledgeable. Their regular menu on the board had an item for $x & after we ordered we saw on their flyer the same item we ordered had a lower price. So when I asked the girl about it she said \" I don't know would you like me to call my manger?\" Then I asked her how much for a scoop of ice cream and she said \"I don't know\". She was apologetic. I felt bad for her."}
{"text":"Honestly, I was looking for a place to sit down and charge my phone in the area. I spotted Wandas and decided to give it a try.  Immediately was greeted by a very, very happy man (assuming he was the owner) and was served by the funniest and sweetest girl!   I tried the chicken panini - amazing, stuffed with chicken (definitely did not cheap out) and some delicious sauce. And then went back for a very rich mango smoothie.  Didn't get to try the bubble tea.   It wasn't particularly the food (though it was amazing) that makes this a five but instead the service. Very great. Thanks for a good lunch!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Nutella with strawberries and bananas crepe and a choice of your ice cream, the crepe don't match the prices which I think the portion are smaller than any others I've tasted with the similar price. But their homemade ice cream is very very good, I recommend the cheesecake or caramel flavoured. Owners is pretty nice, the place is pretty tidy and nice, not too bad!"}
{"text":"I came here with a bunch of people because we wanted to try something different than the usual coffee shop franchises, and aren't we glad we decided to do so! This place is pretty new here. You can tell by the sparkling new equipments they have! I ordered a coffee and ice cream special which tasted great. Food is served on proper China plates and silverware.  Location is cozy. The employee on duty was very friendly. I sat down and he brought my order all the way to me. Their WiFi is fast. The washrooms are clean and modern. Their prices are very reasonable. If you are tired of meeting up at those basic fast food style coffeeshops then consider trying this place, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This was a very open and comfortable environment serving an interesting combination of foods including waffles, bubble tea and shisha. The waffle I ordered was $4.99 with chocolate sauce drizzled over the top and light orange coloured ice cream. The waffle was made fresh from a batch and delivered hot. The reason why it was give four stars is because the waffle had a little too much baking powder in the recipe."}
{"text":"A nice alternative to Asian. In the Beaver Creek area you can count on every form of Asian cuisine, and very good as well.  I pass Wanda's nearly every day on my ritual trek to Chatime in the same strip mall.   Needing a change, I stopped in at Wanda's for a snack to hold me until a late lunch meeting (with Asian food, of course).  I ordered a Ham & Swiss crepe. It came quickly and hot, with the savoury ingredients balancing with the slightly sweet crepe.   I need to come back. Especially for the desert crepes. Soon. The only problem is that I will want to try several desert crepes, so I'm going to need a posse for this. Who's with me?"}
{"text":"I was so excited that a new desserts place opened up @ Commerce Gate.. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed after how I hyped myself up and on missing out on going there the other nite since it was so late... that place was still open.. but we were blocked  by the owner who DO NOT BELIEVE in parking their car inside a parking space but instead, blocking the road by parking rite by the fire route... HUH HELLO?   Finally had a chance to try this place.. for a Friday evening, that place was so dead .. except a large group sitting in the middle.   many empty tables .. many various choices but nothing stood out on the menu.. I ended up getting something but for some reason, got charged an additional dollar even though my ice cream special was stated to be $4.99 only..     my friend got a waffle chocolate dip - which he told me was nothing special.. and to have ice cream on top, it was an additional $2.99!!  and that is not included taxes. wanted to pay by credit card but I was told we would get charged an additional 50 cents for it..  but if we paid by debit, no 50 cents charge.  I asked for water and asked if they had hot water and the girl said no.. even though they DO SERVE TEA, EXPRESSO and COFFEES??  and they had tea bags selection right in front of the counter..  so finally i settle for water with no ice since she said.. no hot water to customers.  though this place was clean, there was an annoying fly hovering around us as we try to eat our desserts. Quite the bother..   I don't know as being Asian and Chinese, we might be more accustomed to desserts being less sweet but those waffles and ice cream were way too sweet..and we definitely needed a Chatime to wash the sweet taste out of our mouths.    I think that place  will do  better as a lunch and breakfast or crepe place but definitely u wouldn't know this was a place that serves sandwiches, salads and breakfast...Honestly being that this mall is 98% Chinese / Asian, I don't see it lasting..  and also due to the weather being so cold so fast this year in sept, i feel the owners should have capitalize in opening sooner, being so much that we barely had a summer.. there really isn't  much demand for ice creams and cold desserts at this time.    for that price, better go to Sweet note or some Chinese desserts at Times Square..   and to the owners or friend's of the owners, please make an effort to park your truck in an empty parking space instead of parking it near the sidewalk by the fire route.. it is a danger hazard and u are also blocking traffic!"}
{"text":"I came to this place to chill with some friends ... The place is nice they had everything  shisha pizza waffles just name it they got it all. The serves were very friendly and nice with fast internet. Over all I liked the place and I will defiantly come over again."}
{"text":"Tried the waffle and ice cream. I think it was $5.49  The waffle itself was small but everything else about the waffle was great. Nice crunch on the outside, soft and a bit of a chew on the inside. Perfect sweetness and tasted excellent. They have a variety of ice cream flavours to choose from. I think the price is reasonable when compared to other dessert places. I only wish they had a larger waffle size for the bigger eaters out there. Its perfect size for the ladies though.   The dessert is served in paper plates and plastic fork/knife so its no upscale dessert place. But this is no big deal as long as the food is good.  Its a solid 3.5 stars for me"}
{"text":"Disgusting place disgusting rude service will never come back here again!!! and they have no soy milk! And They are so ghetto they use paper plates !"}
{"text":"I had the chocolate ice cream waffle which is great as a snack or a small dessert. The waffle overall was really good and they make it fresh, there was a bit too much starch in the waffle imo. It has a nice open environment and even shisha for those interested. Went right after dinner around 7 and it was pretty dead so service was really fast."}
{"text":"I checked out Wanda's Markham having been to the downtown locations a while back. Service was very friendly and helpful. Just like the other locations the food is decent and slightly overpriced. The big difference in Markham is the amount of space and light in the restaurant. I think the menu is more extensive in Markham too. While I probably won't be revisiting for a while, it's not a bad choice."}
{"text":"5 stars for the look and feel of the place. 1 star for the way they serve your food (paper plates from costco and plastic cutlery) 2 stars for the actual food products  Expected a slightly higher end feel when stepping in, like real plates and cutlery. Its the only cafe I know that serves with paper and plastic, but thats fine.  Like others have mentioned, we expected light and fluffy waffles, or sweet waffles (similar to belgian), but got neither. Got a tough, hard waffle, which although was made from scratch in front of us, was cold by the time it got to our table. Which we found to be odd.  I dont see this place lasting. At bubble tea shops, they serve their food/desserts on plates, and with silverware. And their toast tastes better than these waffles. Wife wasn't impressed with the crepes either."}
{"text":"No more expectation......just so so. I had one latte and small waffles with syrup. Tge waffles were not sift at all"}
{"text":"I have never been to a Wanda's waffle but I've heard so much about it and was really excited to see one so close to home.  Because of closed shops I went to prior to Wanda's for desserts, it gave me the opportunity to finally check this place out.  I can strongly say that I will very likely not come back again. The waffle I ordered, the ice cream special, tasted like rubbered sand if that even makes sense. It was just not something that captured my palette which was disappointing as this place was famous for waffles. The mochaccino I had on the other hand was excellent!   From the get go, it was extremely complicated to order where the clerk had to punch in my order more than twice. They had all sorts of promotion going on that my friend and I had to mathematically figure out together to see which was most cost effective. Overall, this experience hasn't left a lasting impression but hoping to try out the one downtown before I pass judgement!"}
{"text":"Went there today. I got a waffle and my friend got a crepe.   First walked in and the place smells delicious. Like powdered sugar and berries. Yum!  Got the waffle and crepe. Waffle was tiny but who cares if its good. It wasn't good.    It was dense and  thick. Not light and fluffy like you would expect and was slightly undercooked.  Coudos for using real whipped cream.  The crepe fared slightly better but it was a bit over done and hard on the bottom.   I'd try again maybe getting a sandwich. Their coffee was great."}
