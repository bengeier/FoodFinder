{"text":"This place is fun!  
The decor is great!  Afterwork watering hole...with all the associated baggage. (be prepared)  
The cocktails are fun and innovative.  
Surprisingly the sushi was quite good.  It was unique and fresh.  I highly recommend the butterfish.  
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Superb restaurant on 4th. Excellent food, creative, contemporary architecture, eclectic customers, this is not your usual sushi places, it is miles above it. Only downside today was the very long wait until we got our food (60 minutes between sitting down and main course, far too long for a busy lunch crowd). We thought it was worth sharing this little improvement need to the front desk hostess, she shrugged and mentioned she would pass the comment on... Another way of saying f** off. A shame because everyone else is very friendly and the decor just superb."}
{"text":"Very fancy for family dinner or if you like to take your coworkers but sushi rolls the smallest I've ever seen"}
{"text":"Ki.. oh how i wanted you to be the perfect cool intimate culinary experience.... but all you were an overpriced dissapointment.  =(

I went to Ki on a date, knowing that both of us are sushi enthusiasts and havent tried any \"fusion\" or more expensive sushi places in Toronto. 

We were initially seated right across from the sushi station, where it was a bit too loud, the tables were a bit too close together to others and i felt like i was at the restaurant with a group of strangers, instead of just with my date, so i requested to be seated on the bar side of the establishment where there were dimmer lights and more loungey music and less people and generally great ambiance

The rock shrimp (breaded and deep fried shrimp) I got to start came in a plentiful bowl. They were little balls of buttery shrimp goodness which melted in my mouth, and the wasabi mayo was just the perfect combination to make the shrimp memorable.

The main dishes were expensive and tiny. The carapaccio was beautifully presented, and tasted good, not exceptional. I am usually okay with small portions as long as they leave me wanting just a littlee bit more.. this however left me feeling like i was cheated out of my money. The spicy scallop makimono was good as well, but really not good value for the price.

The desserts were great! The Flourless Grand Marnier Chocolate Truffle Cake was heaven on a plate. It was deliciously decadent, the chocolate was just dark enough and there was just a tiny hint of grand marnier. Perfect!
I also tried the Ki Choice Trio, which had 3 mini desserts, great for indecisive people like me who want to sample a lot, and are easily bored with one large serving of a single type of food. The trio consisted of mango mousse, vanilla pannacotta & coconut-apricot tart. And they were all super! but I think my favourite was teh mango mousse. 

Overall, this place was good for appetizers and desserts, but the mains left much to be desired. I'd probably just go back here for appetizers, drinks or dessert, and spare myself the $130 bill.

P.S. I initially thought this would be like Blue Fin in NYC (amazinggg fusion sushi), but Ki's got nothing on them."}
{"text":"Loved it. Loved the decor. As a graphic designer - I even loved the simplicity of the menu.

Food was awesome!! The sauces were great and the waitress took the time to explain each item.

Downside: Tables are too close together and it can be very, very busy.
Tables were a little small for all the items we ordered as well."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite Toronto restaurants.  Beef Maki... Tempura Butterfish... it just doesn't get any better!

Service is wonderful too!

May be pricey but sometimes you just want to treat yourself!

(But it is not my scene on Thursday nights... a little too Bay Street Meat Market for me!!)"}
{"text":"My first visit to Ki tonight. The restaurant decor is pretty nice and the after work crowd on Thursday night was decent (lots of suits if that's your thing).

We sat at the sushi bar because they had no tables available. The food was really good - we had some great rolls (Ki modern makimonos):
- BC tuna and chives 
- Ki beef maki
- a salmon roll (can't remember the real name)

They have a huge wine list and quite a few cocktails. No lychee martinis   But I did have a Kyushu cosmo martini which was great and two raspberry prosecco. They were all fantastic. 

We finished the evening with some great deserts - trio of cheesecakes - green tea, chocolate truffle, and mascarpone. It was enough for two and a great way to complete the meal.

While the food is pretty tasty, the prices are pretty high so i gave a it a bit of a lower rating for that reason. The service was good and our server was pretty attentive given how busy the place was. 

Worth a try but probably not somewhere I'd go to regularly."}
{"text":"Food: Good enough
Staff: Knowledgable and pleasant. I felt that the server could have been more attentive, but understandable considering how busy they were. 
Atmosphere: Relaxed, polished and great for catching up with an old friend. 

Overall good, but did not WOW me."}
{"text":"\"....go back alone and sit at the bar - the design is well done and worth spending some time soaking in.\"

Took a manager from my company here for a farewell dinner on a Tuesday night. I called a few hours before to book in and the staff were very accommodating - particularly with my vague arrival time (I wasn't sure exactly when we would arrive).

I have walked past Ki countless times and it always looked stunning and occupied - the latter being a good sign in my eyes.   I was surprised at how large the restaurant's interior was!    Usually I'm not a fan of large restaurants as they can tend to lose the intimate dining experience and the server can be spread too thin.  However, Ki was a pleasant surprise to the contrary.  Our waitress was there when we needed her, the food came out at various times, which worked quite well for our grazing group of 5.   We had edemame, seaweed salad, hamachi, tempura shrimp and vegetables, an array of sushi (spicy tuna, spicy salmon, sweet potato, beef, a warm mixed white fish that I cannot recall the name of, California rolls... I think that's it).   There was enough for all of us - myself and two of the men decided to have another order of the spicy tuna and spicy salmon later on.  I had a wonderful glass of Italian red - again, cant recall the name but its the top of the red list @ $11 / glass. A great accompaniment to the spicy food. 

I would have preferred the tuna and salmon to be more spicy than it was, but I ended up asking for some hot sauce to dip in in, which made it better (although this did take a long time to come out so I was almost done by then!).

Crowd was corporate and pre-ACC concert. A few folk on dates too.

Overall, worth a visit. It's great for a healthy lunch or dinner when you're needing to entertain clients or fellow professionals. Price range was acceptable. 

I would go back.  I would even go back alone and sit at the bar - the design is well done and worth spending some time soaking in."}
{"text":"The service was great. I've had better Asian cuisine in the past, but still would say it is above average. Great to see that the wine list has options for all budgets."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch not knowing what to expect. I have been to Sumo and Kyoto over the last few weeks and felt sushi'd out,  with that said the menu allowed me wander from sushi to a more broad menu selection. The decor was modern, clean yet comfortable. I had the pan seared scallops that were done perfectly. I would go again... price was worth it. Served quickly as well."}
{"text":"I learned about Ki from a co-workers on a business trip to Toronto. He has been promoting Ki since we were in Los Angeles. And, Ki didn't disappoint me.

The food, ambience, and service.. All are good. Our waitress was very attentive to our need. We ordered the chef specials, and everything came wonderful. My favorite sushi was the butter fish. The desert was also awesome. 

I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is for people with money to burn and a tiny appetite 
For $1100 business lunch for 11 people, we shared what they called a unique sharing lunch.  For our money, we got
3 pieces of sushi each, 8 pieces of edamame each with 5 spice powder, 1 piece of galbi (2 inch strip), 1/4 inch of black cod fish, 1 teaspoon of creme Burke , 2 fork full of cake 
We had tea as well. But we were not big alcohol drinkers . We had 5 glasses of wine among us. 
It old cost them under $50 to make the food but a 20 times profit was simply too much. 
This is not a place for business events or anyone who wants to eat like a normal person. They charge way too Much for the nice ambience
I rather go to canoe or Oliver Bonancini because you get similar service but much better food. 
What a scam"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped by on a Friday evening before heading over to a house party. The good first: ambience and decor is great and apt for Bay St, more dressy than not. The service was quick, efficient and our server was very helpful with patiently helping my (rather indecisive) friend choose her appetizers! 

The food, however, seemed average at best. It didn't measure up to the standard you would expect from a place like this. All in all, I like the place to have drinks with friends as it has the perfect atmosphere for that - classy without being uptight but I'll pass on the food if I can help it."}
{"text":"The place does not disappoint. A little pricey, but the flavours are amazing. It is known for its sushi, and you will not go wrong there. Some of the other items are overpriced and come in small portions (though delicious).  Fantastic service, as well. Try to sit on the patio (in the summer) if you can."}
{"text":"Never disappointed with their food. Sashimi is very good 

Service is decent and price is on the high end though. 

Overall value isn't always there"}
{"text":"We were meeting long overdue friends in the past for a couples meeting. We were seated on a not so busy Saturday night. This place gets very busy during the day, but at night is completely different. 

We got a nice booth seated for 4 ppl. We were greeted by our Server who was quite friendly and attentive in giving us instruction about the menu. We started off with some beer and cider. They have quite a selection on beverages.

We started off with apps first. Sweet Potato Wedges w/ Wasabi Mayo.
- Nice wedges that are sweet potato. Wasabi mayo was not that spicy, but more creamy taste.

Miso Chowder- Nice creamy chowder with minced shrimp and bay scallops with crispy lotus root garnish with a long chive stem. Soup was nice, but wish it was more.

Kushiyaki Drumette- Basically chicken drum with some barbecue sauce and sesame seeds. Not bad, but its normal chicken drum to me.

Kushiyaki Pork Belly- 2x skewer of pork belly braised with some sauce and green onion. This has some nice fat, but nice meat as well. This was a nice dish.

Kara-Age- Boneless breaded chicken with some spices dip with creamy sauce. Nice taste and texture of the meat.

Shishito Peppers- Some hidden spice, but mostly sweet. Its grilled and tasted nice.

Bistro Shrimp- Tempura shrimp with creamy mayo. Normal stuff to me.

Mains we had: Fish and Chips.
- Fish was cut up in 4-5 circled pieces and you can dip in tartar sauce or a fish broth like liquid. Chips were literally chips.

Rack of Lamb: Cooked just right at Medium. Tasted really nice.

Japanese Pepper Steak (14oz). This was cooked fine as well, the only thing about this dish that was a miss is the peppery really ruined my tongue palette. 

Eating all this for 4 ppls was quite a bit of food. Service was attentive, but not intrusive. They have valet parking for $14, and do coat check or bag check for you as well. They like to time their service, and they also have some nice tea beverages that are loose leaf. 

Overall, this place is quite pricey. We had mainly their hot food, but they also offer cold plates and sushi/sashimi. The bill is quite pricey, but for an establishment located here at Bay/Wellington, its kind of expected. Food quality was good, service was good, atmosphere is a bit dark, and they have nice selection of music at times.

Check out this place if you like to bring a date or have money to splurge.!"}
{"text":"I took my now fiancée to dinner here before proposing somewhere else downtown. I told the manager before hand and she took care of us. The service was phenomenal.  Realizing it was our special day, the staff went above and beyond by giving us free rolls and drinks. They could not have done a better job taking care of us.  The food was also delicious as always.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good spot for project celebrations.  Menu is extensive enough that even those who aren't into Sushi will enjoy their meal.  Price is in line with what you should be expecting to spend on Bay St."}
{"text":"Both my wife and I have developed an appreciation for good quality Japanese dishes over the years, however, we just left this restaurant and we are very disappointed. 

It was overpriced and the sushi served were not FRESH! Perhaps left over from Wednesday night. I told my wife that after brushing my teeth twice that I still could not get rid of that awful aftertaste.

We were also not impressed with the two waitress standing by the door when we were walking out. They were having a personal discussion and they did not even acknowledge us such as thank you, Hope to see you soon!

Management has obviously lost passion for quality and proper training of their staff!!! 
There are much  better Japanese fusion restaurant in the area and along Lakeshore.

This place is such a Fraud!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and varied enough with our limited menu choices (vegetarian). All but one dish was spot on but hey....no one's perfect. Service was excellent with very attentive staff with nice touch's like hot towel service and complimentary appy and dessert samples which were much appreciated. Coming from Vancouver we had our doubts about finding really good Japanese in Calgary but we were pleasantly surprised especially by the bill at the end of the night We will return when we're back in town!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is delicious and the service is attentive. The people who visit this restaurant and bar are friendly. People are generally here to socialize with others and meet new people."}
{"text":"Does this place honestly take itself seriously? I hope not because the place is full of posers and suburban tourists. And i am a suburbanite so i know one when i see one! Honestly, if you watch the doors at around 7:00 you will see the women in business suits walk out and the drouling cougars walk in. The way that the bar is situated so close to the tables at the extremities creates a bottleneck of people that is either a) a fire code violation, or b) a molester's dream. The food is hastily put together and they know they can over-price it because of where they are located. Plenty of better options close by. Avoid if you can help it. If you are after eye candy go to South of Temperance."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! Outstanding service! Our server Ingrid has really made this an exceptional experience. I recommend trying the Spicy Avocado Cucumber Wrap ))))"}
{"text":"The food was great, but very expensive. I ordered the filet cooked medium, and the steak was rare, which I wasn't happy about. I let the waitress know and the steak was re-cooked and was great. Amazing appetizers!"}
{"text":"Dining room and decor: this place is much larger than the exterior suggests and there are several dining areas in the restaurant as well as 2 bars. I was seated at the sushi bar which had these wierd chairs. (Comfortable to sit on but hard to pull forward.) 

Food: I ordered a dynamite roll and a beef steak bento box. The sushi was nice and the toasted seasame seeds were a flavour plus. My steak was soft and just-right but I couldn't eat the fancy coleslaw that came with the box. The bento box was boring and uninspiring for all of $28.

Service was cordial but not fast for a lunch hour in Calgary. 

So I finished my $38 lunch and left the restaurant making big plans for my 3:00 snack because I was still so hungry. I doubt I'll be back unless I have a business associate I really want to impress with expensive OK food."}
{"text":"3 out of 5! Similar to Blowfish. Overpriced sushi! Recommend Ki Spider and Rock Shrimp Tempura"}
{"text":"For the price and what you get; save your money.  I've never eaten such mediocre and overpriced sushi before in Toronto.  Let's start with their tea...their tea which the waiter described \"marvellous\" was sub-par.  They use the same (inexpensive) dry leaves you can easily purchase for yourself.  Their Sake selection is decent, for Toronto.  We ordered their Toro Tower, Spicy Scallop, Kiwi-Tuna, Spicy Avocado, Hamachi Jalapeno and Black Cod..which was pleasing to the palette however it fully failed to achieve more than a \"well, jolly good.\"  Their wasabi definitely had more of a kick than your usual paste, but it is definitely not fresh when it hits your plate.

If this is the best Toronto has to offer - I'm terribly disappointed.  For the same price and less in another city (i.e. NYC comes to mind), I've had much, much, much better sushi."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh Ki.  This place is a definite hot spot for after work drinks.

I had dinner here once, and I was very unimpressed- So it took some arm twisting to get me to go back.  Aand well, I'm glad I did.

I went there for lunch yesterday, and everything we had was DEELISH!

The Sockeye Salmon role is creative, super yummy and fresh.

The real star was my Ahi Tuna Burger made with sashimi grade tuna (which I got as rare as possible) wasabi mayo and sweet potato wedges.

I was so full from the appies but I couldn't stop eating my main.  The tuna was melt in your mouth tender, and the sweet potato and wasabi mayo was SO good.

I'll be back going back.  Soon."}
{"text":"Overpriced pick-up place.  

The sushi is overpriced and by no means fantastic.  Great service though.  I'd stick to drinks!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant. We made a reservation for a client lunch meting on a Monday.

Table was ready when we arrived and hostess brought us directly to our tables. Walking through the restaurant to our table I could see how nice this restaurant looks. There is definite attention to detail but the decor in not overkill, it's simple and perfect for the setting.

The server was attentive to not continually ask us if we were ready to order yet as she was able to figure out that we were chatting about work. So we appreciated that. When we did order, he client and I both had the sushi special, while my colleague ordered the tuna steak. The sushi special was very good with a nice variety of fish, rolls, and sauce. I would recommend. I didn't really know what to order as the menu seemed complicated but. Made a simple choice and was not disappointed. When the plate of the tuna came it looked even better. Next time I will try that. 

I would recommend this restaurant for some looking for good Asian and Japanese cuisine and not looking at the price."}
{"text":"Went with my wife two kids and mother-in-law. Fell into this; right next to the hockey Hall of Fame. Can't say enough good things: waitstaff, hostess, food, ambience... This place has it all. Five stars! Don't understand why people are not sitting this five stars... Doesn't make sense to us."}
{"text":"Great food amazing and very well informed staff. Go with the chefs choices AMAZING flavours often surprising never disappointing."}
{"text":"Beautiful Room, stunning entrance and lounge area.  I am weary though however about a restaurant indicating Market Pricing on a Sushi / Sashimi platter. 

The menu is a weird combination of steakhouse and japanese cuisine which is an attempt to broaden its appeal to those squeamish about Japanese food.  Overall, for the price, this place doesn't even compete compared to Globefish for example in terms of quality, quantity and presentation.  It is a place to take clients when you have the firms expense account paying the bill which is something that occurs quite frequently in oil rich Calgary.  Food was good although uninspired, portions were smallish for what you pay. 

 It not to say this place is bad if someone else is paying the bill, but if you are looking at footing it on your own, take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food fast service and a awesome atmosphere. Had lots of sushi loaded with flavour and I highly recommend the black cod. Portions aren't huge they are perfect for getting lots of flavour without stuffing yourself and being able to eat plenty. Wide selection of wine and sake. If your a sushi lover and you want to go out with friends or enjoy the sushi bar with a friend I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ok, so the real lowdown is that this place only exists so that it can cater to the Thursday after-work Bay St banker crush. There is a patio and there are seats but the food is so crazy overpriced that if you are reading about this place for the first time in these reviews and didn't go there last Thursday with your banker co-workers and play credit card roulette for the bill with your American Express Black card just for jokes, then you should probably do what I do and just have a drink or two and eat elsewhere.

Ok sounds like I am hating on it but in reality if I want a place to go downtown to meet other financial core working friends after work on a non-Thursday, this is not a good place. You can overspend a bit and have a few martinis or sake-tinis, and because I am a closet otaku anything that sounds Japanese gets a bonus rating star just because. The decor is very nice and they use real juices for their cocktails, etc. But don't eat food here, go to Ema-tei if you want authentic, reasonable izakaya food, or if you want robatayaki and want to spend a bit more go to Nami."}
{"text":"Came here for a work related lunch on a Wednesday. The restaurant itself is quite nice and draws the corporate bay street crowd. We were here on a Wednesday and the restaurant was fully booked for lunch (probably a result of the holiday season - not sure if it is like this regularly).

The service is very good here with attentive servers who offer advice and suggestions on the menu items.
The food is presented quite nicely.

We ordered the sushi platter (from the lunch menu). It was expensive at $24 for 3 pieces of sashimi, 3 pieces of sushi, 6 pieces of maki (very small). To be honest, though the food looked great, it was no different in taste than what we would get from Sushi on Bloor which would give us more than double the quantity of food for cheaper! We also ordered the AAA tenderloin - which was tasty but also $28 for a 6 oz piece with no accompaniments. We had rock shrimp tempura, which was good but I have had better.

I would only recommend this place to try for maybe drinks and some apps but would not come here for a meal. You will not be full after and pay a price similar to Nobu but with far less tasty dishes.
Though everything looks great, it is not that satisfying at the end.

Our lunch came to almost $130 for two people with no alocholic beverages. I don't think it was worth the price. If you are looking for a high end Japanese restaurant, I would suggest Blowfish at King and Bathurst as I think the food is superior to Ki and the restaurant is very nice."}
{"text":"I love this place, the ambiance, the food, the service. All so perfect, maybe too flawless. I came here with a friend, and we ordered the sushi pizza's which were amazing, And salmon sashimi, which was perfectly cool & fresh. Can't say anything els that could describe the greatness of this place. Well done Ki, well done.."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food, the presentation, the friendly service and the wine followed by decadent in-house-made chocolate.
Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"It was my first visit to Ki for lunch and the service was beyond terrible.

We were a table of 3 on a Friday afternoon for a late lunch. The atmosphere was pleasant. By the time we arrived the place was emptying out after the lunch rush so I'm not sure why it took almost half hour to get our apps. Our server, Ingrid, was not only rude but very intimidating (an ugly trait for a server). Our pops arrived and all of them were flat, not only did she NOT apologize, she never brought us new ones and told us (half way through our meal) that the problem was trying to be resolved and when it was she would comp them. Two of us then decided to order iced tea since it didn't require carbonation, she ended up charging us for them! It wasn't the $6 charge it was the principle of the matter.

Our server not only was rude, she kept chatting with other staff not far from our table which made all of us feel very uncomfortable. Also the food runners consistently reached over our food while we were eating to fill our water and trying to take plates we had not finished. 

We ordered 4 apps and 3 rolls, the bill was over $100... Not worth it.
The miso chowder was delicious, seaweed salad was inedible, tempura and rolls were mediocre.

Overall Ki has left a very bad taste in my mouth and I will never return."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary at Ki. To our delight, this place well exceeded our expectations.

We were recommended by our server (Diana) a tasting menu, which she diligently crafted to our needs (i.e. she asked about any allergies, preferences, etc. beforehand). We had the opportunity to try several dishes, all of which were both beautiful looking and tasty. It included pieces of different sashimis, kiwi rolls, and some of their original creations. Without exception, all of them were excellent. Also, Diana made a great job suggesting a delicious sake to accompany our dinner, which complimented perfectly the flavours of our dishes.

Our excellent server also arranged for us a dessert for our anniversary, which was a flan-tasting custard beautifully decorated and flavourful. As if that was not enough, we also received two pieces of chocolate crafted in house!

In all, both the food and the service were outstanding and some of the best we have experienced in Calgary. I highly recommend Ki for special occasions or just to try it out. We will definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Glitz and glamour.  High ceilings, wood, red leather.  This place was built to take advantage of the big bucks of the suit and tie crowd of the financial district.

It seems like every major North American city has an ultra sheek \"modern Japanese\" restaurant... so why not Toronto, right?  This is definitely not your typical level of Japanese cuisine.  The presentation is immaculate, selection is impressive and freshness of the fish is commendable.  You certainly do not want to nickle and dime at an establishment such as this, so do yourself a favour and expect to drop a hundred bucks per person.

One surprise was how great their grilled entrees were.  But after reading about who was behind this idea, it all made sense; the owners of The Keg.  And as far as chain steakhouses go, I quite like The Keg.

Unfortunately I had to drop it down to a two star, because most clienteles were... well, how should I say it... douche bags?  :)  Cocky arrogant stock brokers were flooding this place, and with one too many sake, it seems like their samurai bushido spirit was kicking in.  

Oh hi, are you having your dinner?  May I interrupt you?  Are you going to the bathroom?  May I follow you?

I don't really care if you have a Rolex on so keep your hands to yourself boys."}
{"text":"You know you're hooked on Yelp when you make a date with a friend just to earn a  badge. But that's exactly what I did with a fellow Yelper as we set out on a quest to earn the Sushi Sensei badge! 

Not only did we want to earn the badge, but we also wanted to be able to compare the restaurants like for like. We decided that an order of California rolls would be our staple in every restaurant and we would supplement that with an order of the restaurant's feature rolls. Now, you're probably thinking \"that's a LOT of mayonnaise and fake crab\". Well reader, read on, because although we risked OD-ing on mayonnaise and getting mercury poisoning, we came out with some great tips for anyone seeking sushi in Calgary's downtown area!

Sushi Stop #3: Ki Modern Japanese 
I think I'm in love!!  just want to sit on the Ki outdoor patio, sip Japanese-inspired cocktails and eat fancy sushi. Ki has classy written all over it. From the lounge seating near the entrance, to the private booths in the rear to the comfortable and sunny patio space out front.

We could tell the second we walked in that this is not your traditional sushi restaurant. Just as the name implies, this is a modern twist on a Japanese restaurant. This means that they still have sushi, nigiri, tempura and maki on the menu, but they also have spiced up the traditional with some modern Japanese flare. 

So, despite many other temptations on the menu, we stuck to our plan and ordered California rolls. But this time, it wasn't fake crab... we were dining on real king crab!! As you would guess, the California rolls we had at Ki were the highest rated of our evening adventure. 

For our second place, we decided to go with the hamachi + jalapeno. Hamachi means 'yellow tail' in Japanese, and it was served as thin slices of fish topped with a very thin slice of jalapeno on the top. Delicious, and the presentation was spectacular as well. 

We also partook in a sake martini - a fresh twist on traditional sake. The entire cocktail list looked fantastic. I could have happily spent the entire evening sitting on this patio, exploring both the food and drink menu. 

Ki is all about the details. From beautifully branded white cloth napkins, to hot hand washing cloths, to teardrop shaped soya sauce containers and attentive waiters - this place has it all. All this doesn't come without the price tag to match, but if you are looking for a classy lounge for after work drinks, an exciting modern Japanese menu (as the name implies!) or just a place for great people watching, Ki is your spot! I know I'll be back!

{"text":"Excellent service, sommelier and delicious food. Bonus points for something I have never experienced before: I mentioned (in passing, as a joke) that I wished I had reading glasses to help my aging eyes read the menu. Literally 30 seconds later the waiter showed up with a fancy display of with loaner reading glasses of varying strength. Amazing!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times. Never disappointed. Very elegant. Beautiful food. The halibut is delicious. All the veggies are amazing. Will be back for sure. Perfect for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Food was \"okay\" but service was poor. Requested sushi bar but it was closed due to private party. We sat next to a couple where their server was attentive and checked back. We left without ordering more due to the lack of service. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Went to Ki for the first time yesterday and was very disappointed. I over hear so many people mentioning they are going to Ki so I expected the food to be good, not great but at least minimum good. We ordered tomago ngiri, spicy salmon, tuna, butterfish sashimi and some edamame. I was very disappointed in all the dishes. I would rather stick to going to my cheap sushi place in Yorkville than eat food here. The venue is nice and the service was great but the food was meh. Wouldnt go back for the food, maybe some after work drinks."}
{"text":"The decor in this place is gorgeous, very modern and sleek. It's an indication that things are very upscale - prices included.

Not really craving sushi, I got the teriyaki salmon bento box and my friend grabbed a few sushi rolls (spicy tuna and tempura).

Everything comes out well presented (I feel like this is expected with Japanese cuisine) and everything we got was fresh and well prepared. Unfortunately, portions are a bit small and I wasn't full. We decided to get dessert since we clearly had room - chocolate truffle cake.

Again, portioned quite small but the cake was very dense and rich so the size was understandable. The burnt caramel and candied corn flakes accompanying the cake were a nice touch.

It's a tough call for me, the food was really good but to pay what we did and not be full isn't something that would bring me back here."}
{"text":"Ok lunch coupled with Bay Street prices.  For lunch, try to get there before the noontime rush.  Black cod is decent but beef lacked flavour.  Spicy salmon roll was forgettable and kombucha was a skip.  Ambiance is nice, especially if you are wanting a bigger dining room to entertain clients.  

Service was good overall.  It's a convenient spot to dine in the Financial district but otherwise, not a must visit destination."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant but be prepared for the price. This place is quite pricey. Almost every dish is $20 or more. The wasabi is the best anywhere! The wine list is extensive. The ambiance is hip and happening well frequented by Bay St suits. Show up well dressed to get noticed and bring your gold card. Valet parking is available for you Porsche :)"}
{"text":"Bad sushi, inconsistent and often arrogant wait staff, pass."}
{"text":"Typical of Japanese restaurants along the coast, the sushi/sashimi was extremely fresh and fantastic.  Some of their rolls where extremely inventive and whimsical and a pure delight.  Our waiter was wonderful and very helpful with recommendations.  My only disappointment was with the creme brulee trio for desert.  The texture of the custard was a bit rough and the crust was too thick and hard.

I lucked out in getting a table in the back dining room away from the bar/lounge out front, which I would imagine would be a bit loud and would take away from the meal."}
{"text":"While traveling in town for business this WAS my favourite place to sit at the bar and have a drink and dinner.  Tonight I came in and sat in the lounge and it was nearly 15 minutes without any acknowledgement by a wait person.  I had to get up and go ask the bartender while I watched several waitresses go by. Finally got a menu and a negative vibe. Food was under par for the price, this place has lost it's passion. Will not be coming back"}
{"text":"Best cream caramel I have ever eaten excellent sushi and sashimi good selection of Japanese beers Very good service by  Paul"}
{"text":"Being gluten -free doesn't present me with many Japanese food dining options in Calgary. When I went to Ki I was surprised to see how I could order almost all of the items gluten-free (some with minor modifications). 

I love their tempura - having had the real tempura from Japan before I had to go gluten-free- I will not say it is better than the real deal but it is a life saver for those who doesn't have the option. It is not greasy like most gluten-free based fried foods nor heavy in texture.

Not only are their sashimi's including the urchin fresh , the server's are extremely helpful and chatty. 

Besides my dietry restrictions , we also have a toddler and she absolutely loves it here. We never had issues bringing her here. 

Considering the challenges associated being a sushi restaurant in Calgary , five stars to Ki for their food and great service."}
{"text":"Last Saturday my wife and I just dropped in to sit at the bar and enjoy a late afternoon cocktail, and I'm glad we did.
We had the pleasurable experience of being served by Kelly. Kelly whipped up a special drink for my wife that was yummy and I had a regular cocktail. The conversation was fun and informative. My wife tried her first Sushi and we both loved it.
Great atmosphere with great professional service and food = why you need to drop by Ki for a great time"}
{"text":"Today we decided to have lunch outside so we showed up a bit early to get a spot in the patio area. let's just say it wasn't as warm as yesterday so there were no crowds outside! I'm any event the heaters were on so if was great.

We ordered the sashimi platter, and supplemented that with some a la carte sushi, the shrimp and scallop skewers and the pork belly.  I have to say that the pork belly is awesome and dare I say a must order to share.  The sashimi was fresh and true to other visits here, was tasty.

Service as always was great as we were checked up on regularly, but not annoyingly so.  I'm looking forward to my next lunch at Ki!"}
{"text":"Thus far, I have yet to find a place that serves as unique a selection of dishes as Ki while maintaining freshness, flavor, service and atmosphere.

Besides uniqueness and delicious sushi, Ki has a killer martini list, great non-sushi lovers a la cart selections and excellent atmosphere. There are nice details sprinkled throughout Ki like the amuse bouche at the beginning of the meal, the bills presented with spicy chocolate truffles and the monogrammed cloth napkins.

All these details are important, but what really sold me on Ki has been the staff. I love to modify menus, I really don't have a good reason for this habit except it's just who I am... maybe I like to test the kitchen, maybe I am picky, who knows, but the staff at Ki have always been very accommodating. As a testament to excellent training, they know the menu very well and are ready with suggestions, and even their own modification recommendations, for me to try; all of which - I have to say - have been delicious.

With all this attention to detail, well trained staff and monogramming, Ki comes at a price; you will pay a premium for the sushi at this restaurant. If you are looking for cheap and cheerful, but decent sushi, there are a handful of other places in the city that do an exceptional job; Ki is for a nicer, more unique, sushi experience.

{"text":"I can't stand this place mostly for the schmoozy, wheeling-dealing meet-market vibe on Thursday nights (and most days). 

Popular with the suit crowd. It has a great location on Bay St. and super convenient. Easy to spot with its flaming torches framing the patio. It looks exclusive and distinct but it's not really not that special. I find it kind of sleazy.

Good for post-work drinks and a power lunch that'll set you back $30 for fusion sushi that isn't that good (think kiwi slice and raspberry sauce on rolls). 

There was a mumps outbreak a few years ago among the staff and Ki had to shut down for months. I haven't returned since."}
{"text":"I had a craving for Japanese, remembered this place and decided to give it a shot.  I agree with other reviewers: it's a beautiful resto (Adrian B.'s description of \"stunning\" fits perfectly) but be prepared to pay high prices for your experience.

Fusion is pertty much what this place is going for. It's a Japanese restauraunt but don't expect to find your typical california roll with pollock - it's not going to be on the menu. You will find some of your favorites but you should also be open too innovative dishes and twists on the classics - it seems to be what this place is going for.

The standout of the night was - without a doubt - the service. Our server walked us through the entire menu, gave honest opinions about what he liked and didn't like along with an explanation of why. His knowledge of the restauraunts offerings was unlike any either of us had experienced, after his walk through we both felt comfortable with the menu. Of particular interest was his mention of dishes that he thought had great flavour pairings (like a \"sweet\" dish paired would a \"sour\" dish, etc).  I was intrigued to try some of  these combos but unfortunatly my date was not really interested in trying anything he considered \"out there\".  We took his advice on a few of his recommended dishes (the tuna roll and the spicy avocado come to mind) and were not dissapointed. Our water was always topped up, and our soya sauce never went dry.

We both found ourselves wowed by the presentation and, more importantly, the layers of flavours invovled in the dishes that we selected. The serving sizes were good for us, what we ordered ended up being just enough for us to feel satisfied and not stuffed. I think we were the perfect amount of hungry for this place ( I can also understand how some reviewers felt that they didn't have enough to eat - we didn't show up there \"christmas dinner\" hungry or anything).

For a late, Friday night dinner date, this place worked for us. We both came away really liking it and being happy with the overall experience. I can understand why some of the reviewers think this place is pompous and over priced, but sometimes that works!

If you are looking for a shi shi dinner experience - this is your place."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! That pretty much sums it all. They had enough options for a vegetarian person and their drinks selection is quite extensive."}
{"text":"If I could draw hearts on this place... I would. I have come here at least 20times. Every summer I'm here at the least.. once a month. Ki is like that perfect little black dress. Consistent, sassy and always a classic. 

Absolutely LOVE this place. It's my go to place on Wed for dinner (especially the patio part) Thursday (mostly an older crowd heavily circulating the bar) and Fridays for late evening dinners. 

They serve you with the utmost professionalism. When we call and book a table , we always have the same server everytime.He remembers our previous order to the DOT. 
Summer time is amazing here, the patio attracts everyone.Thursday is a popular night. Everyone ends up here after work. The mood is casual but chic. 

*Tip: make a reso ahead of time and tip well. They will remember you ;)

Personally, I am a sauce person. One of the main reasons I keep coming back here is because this place has so much variety with the side sauces.. It's awesome!
ones you have to try - Black sesame sauce ,mango hot sauce(spicy)
wasabi-garlic cream mayo, seven-spice chili (tangy and spicy at the same time)

I almost always have the same order. The more I go, the more the server recognizes my taste and recommends me something new ^-^

Yakitori Chicken -  perfect to share and with a plum side sauce, it's sweet and tender. 
Swordfish with shishitu peppers with salsa - THIS is something new. The salsa that comes with this is very tropical. It goes really well with the fish.
Shrimp + Scallops - good for sharing, cooked so well you WILL want to order more. 
 
AAA Striploin cubes with drizzled teriyaki sauce - delicious!!!!!!! 5 star meat. Small portion. 
jumbo Black Tiger Shrimp| - Myeh. I've had better. Too much batter. 
Rock Shrimp with wasabi-garlic cream dip(spicy) - THE BEST APP EVER!!! - think KFC popcorn chicken ... but BETTER! ha! 

Curry Rice - delicious!
Ki Spider Maki Roll - delicious. This sushi has perilla leaves and chives all over. It gives a completely different taste. 
California Rolls - so fresh! the avocado is a hit here! 
Ki Beef Maki - I wasn't a fan but a few guests really liked this..
Tempura Butterfish -  Amazing. There is at least 3 types of fish battered with veggie tempura's. It's usually the best option for people that do not like seaweed. 
Filet Mignon with sauteed asparagus - This is a heavy entre, I never finish it. But definitely easy on the eyes. The prep alone will make you want to sit and stare at it ha! It's a big hit with my out of town friends!

Dessert: They have a trio option for ice cream or Cheesecake - which is awesome!. This is heaven if you want to try out the rest of the Dessert menu and/or share!
The Grand Marnier Chocolate cake is very rich and tends to taste sour after a few bites. The chocolate is dark and goes well with a tea. 

For the drinker: try the plum Sake - it's really got a kick!

Always an excellent dining experience. I have yet to find anywhere that provides everything this place does. Class, fun, patio, sushi, wine,steak,immaculate bathroom & furniture, GORGEOUS bathrooms, Carpeted sections (stiletto friendly) & most of all - they really recognize loyal customers.

{"text":"I walked into Benihama for a quick NYE bite with some friends and when we sat down we were brought a single NYE menu.  Now most times I would consider this but I wasn't super hungry so spending $100 for this menu seemed ridiculous to me considering we made reservations and were not told we could not order off their regular menu then.  I called up Ki and made a reservation painlessly and quickly.

We walked on over to Ki in no time and were quickly seated at our table.  The place looks awesome, very intimate, very romantic and a very large space.  You won't realize how large it is until you go to the washrooms.  The place was packed with people that were all dressed up for the night.  I'm not going to lie, but I might have seen the most gorgeous girls during this trip to TO at Ki last night.

Anyways back to the food, I ended up ordering maguro, butterfsh, ki spider roll and another roll that I can't think of right now.

The maguro and butterfish were good but I can't get my mind off of the tuna I had over the summer out in Vegas.

The Ki spider roll was good, I got to sample some veggie tempura and one of my friends rolls with lobster in it.  They were also good.  I had overheard someone at my table say that the halibut they cooked up was the best they had ever tried.  That made me happy as it was my choice to come here after Benihama.

I warn you now though the price is pretty high.  Some of the sashimi quality was comparable to some lower end places but others were a lot better.  I will most likely try this place again as it moves into my top 5 for sushi in town.  Nami is still my favourite in town at the moment but the decor here is probably my favourite out of all the sushi restaurants.

Our service was fantastic last night as well.  Our server was very funny and very attentive."}
{"text":"Excellent high end sushi that's catered for business and special occasions. The venue is a spectacular setting that will impress your guests. They have a great lounge with happy hour specials to balance the economic downturn. Their staff is well trained but their night time manager who had been there my last two trips is more focused on chatting with the female employees than the clientele. 

I love the menu and atmosphere at Ki but prefer Sukiyaki House on 9th for Japanese given it's more intimate, equally great for business, has higher quality fish, half the price and it's more professional Management team."}
{"text":"Worst food at a Japanese restaurant  I've ever had. So disappointed in this restaurant.  I've had better maki rolls from my grocery store in Wisconsin!  The spicy edamame was bland.  The sockeye salmon roll was very bland and tasteless. This was a dinner I hope I can soon forget.  I thought I would have a great dinner here in Toronto but did not.  The service was ok.  I would recommend that the Ritz Carlton take it off their list of recommended Asian restaurants. Terrible, terrible, terrible!"}
{"text":"I've probably been to this place about a dozen times and I still love going even though Blowfish opened up just down the street. The raw fish is very fresh and they even serve up UNI - sea urchin, a lot of Japanese/Sushi joints don't carry this. The Uni there is very fresh, which is immensely important since consuming not fresh Uni could have you stay away from sushi for a very long time if you catch my drift. 
The service is quite prompt and friendly for small groups and large groups - I went there with 20 of us once for a function and they provided us a private dining area. Time your dinner carefully as you might run into the obnoxious patrons that come for drinks after work. Then it turns into a pick up bar with guys trying to tell you about their stock portfolio. I suppose that could be a selling feature for some."}
{"text":"I live near Brookfields and always pass by this restaurant on a daily basis. I decided to try their dinner menu on a whim. I appreciate how the restaurant had diversity among the staff members, but little did I know that I would be profiled during my dining experience.  

Service: When I entered the restaurant, I was \"greeted\" by a brunette hostess. She stared at me with disgust, seated me at the bar, threw the menus in front of me, and walked away. I waited 20 - 30 minutes for my server, to take my order, and afterwards service was non-existent. My server evidently tried to ignore me and diligently tended other customers, particularly those who were caucasian and dressed in business attire. Even the sushi chefs at the bar had noticed his horrible behaviour and gave me some sashimi on the house. After questioning why i've had a shitty experience so far, I looked around and noticed that I was the only Asian dining that night, which made me feel like I was being profiled. Did he assume I wouldn't tip him or something..? LOL  However the towel boy and the chefs were really nice, which gives me hope for this restaurant.

Food: The food isn't that great, especially for the price. I would compare the quality similar or slightly better than an AYCE restaurant. 

There are better sushi restaurants in Toronto. If you are looking for a restaurant in the area, there is Katana on Bay up the street! However, for the price and quality, I would rather eat at JaBistro or Yasu where the service is welcoming and the food is blessed."}
{"text":"We let our server bring us selections of food, we were a party of 16. It was a fantastic way to enjoy our meal! Pricey, but it's to be expected in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"I work around the area and noticed that there was always an ambience at the restaurant when I walked by in the evening. I took it as a sign that the food must be amazing but in reality it's disappointing.

Location is great. The decor of the restaurant is nice but the food isn't good (that is, if you like top quality Japanese food)."}
{"text":"I really liked the feel of this place. It's gorgeous, modern and just straight up expensive feeling. I felt pampered, even though all I was out for was dinner with a friend. The meal itself was good, but nothing really stood out to me. I really love sushi though, so it's getting a bit hard to be wowed. The issue here though is the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant sets the bar really high, then the food lets you down a bit. I felt it was a tad overpriced for what I received. I had a good night with my friend and I won't say no to coming back, but there's more affordable places I might choose first if I'm not in the mood for a luxury dining experience."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, good food.  I'm glad it wasn't busy when we showed up for dinner late on a Friday night.  It seems like a dress code type of place.  We had just come from the ballet, so that wasn't an issue for us, but I prefer more casual places myself.

Extensive drinks menu.  I ordered two unique cocktails for us.  They were both fantastic, although they weren't cheap.  There's a huge bar in the center that was full of people.  We chose a quieter table near the front of the restaurant. 

We ordered an assortment of dishes to share: the sweet potato wedges, spicy tuna rolls, spicy salmon rolls, the grilled tenderloin.  All of the dishes were delicious, although kind of small servings (especially for the price).  Great presentation of the food.

Also:  The washrooms are beautiful (and clean)."}
{"text":"Exellent choice! The service was amazing and the food was from another world! We ate the tempura unagi roll and the lobster tempura roll, we also ate the rack of lamb with seasoned vegetable!! DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"What a great sushi experience. My girlfriend and I sat at the bar where the chef prepares sushi in front of you. We ordered Sashimi Salad, Lobster maki, Spider Maki, Dynamite maki, and White chocolate cake for desert. The portion is very big and taste very fresh. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Ki is a good spot for Japanese cuisine and sushi, and a nice thing is that they serve their full menu relatively late (10:30 PM). They have a good selection of sake, liquor, and beer. The sushi rolls here were prepared well and very nice. I had a California roll and Spicy Tuna roll, both of which were very good. If you order tea here, it is presented very in a proper fashion with the hot teapot with tea leaves brought out. The ambiance here is very good, though it's a bit dark inside."}
{"text":"Ki is one of the most beautiful places I have visited during my time in Toronto. In short, fancy and pricy -- come expecting to spend a lot of money. And dress up!

I was here with my family at about 9 PM on a Friday night. The food items are served in courses, and we ate them family style as follows:

1. tempura jumbo black tiger shrimp and miso-marinated atlantic salmon kushiyaki
2. spicy salmon maki rolls, hamachi (yellowtail) nigiri, and benizake (salmon) sashimi
3. teriyaki chicken and grilled short ribs

I am FAR from a sushi connoisseuse, but it is the first time I have had Japanese that didn't make me sick. I enjoyed the shrimp a salmon a good deal, but the short ribs were the favorite at our table. Yummy!

The service was A+ excellent."}
{"text":"Weekday lunch date with my s/o.  Decor is nice, if a little dated (carpets and furniture look old and faded).  Service was great - attentive and friendly.  

Ordered the SUSHI/SASHIMI LUNCH, SASHIMI a la carte, and house-made OSHINKO PICKLES. Quality of ingredients was very good (the butter fish was excellent!) but portions were small for the price and presentation was average.  

Dinner menu looked interesting.  Will likely go back at least once to try the dinner menu (lobster tempura!) but not for lunch.  

If looking for a high quality/better value downtown sushi lunch, go to Oyshi Sushi at Yonge/Harbour.  If looking for high quality/upscale/trendy go to Miku at Queens Quay/Bay.  Both are excellent, one is just more fancy & expensive than the other."}
{"text":"Beautifully designed space, very friendly & attentive staff, good wine/extensive sake selection and tasty food -- I liked it!

Dinner for 3 (not including tip) was ~$145:

1 glass red wine
1 hot sake (12 oz)
1 lg bottle Pellegrino
2 orders sushi (2 pcs ea)
1 sashimi salad
3 orders maki rolls (6 pcs ea)
1 side edamame (huge)
Chicken yakitori (2 skewers)
Spicy jumbo shrimp (4 shrimps)"}
{"text":"Do try their Maple Teriyaki Salmon, that was delicious. Do not try their house Ginger ade/soda, that was not good.
Their sushi is fresh and tasty, but my favorite part of the meal was the maple teriyaki salmon, it was so delicious, I liked the accompanying broccolini, the potato au gratin was okay, didn't really go well with the salmon for me. We were both stuffed from dinner, but the restaurant gave us dark chocolate as a compliments and they were good too. What a perfect way to end a meal."}
{"text":"The best overall restaurant in Toronto by far! Atmosphere, staff, service, food and drink all are tops on my list. Why bother going else where? My husband says they have the coldest beer in the city. If you have not been it's definitely worth trying. I am sure you will love it."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars.

I've passed by this place almost every day, twice a day for the last 5 years on my commute and have only recently thought to give it a go. The main dining area is your typical financial district schmooze joint which makes it impossibly loud, further enhanced by its proximity to the acc/sky dome so it's bound to be busy on game nights*. Luckily the back private room and sushi bar areas are sectioned off from the main dining so the sound doesn't quite carry over. 

The menu gives you plenty of options and the drink menu even more so. Ummm, hells yes extensive sake menu. The ambiance and the menu give you a hint of what to come but the food, once served, in one word: swank. Everything is beautifully plated, some truly looking like works of art. There were hits and misses with the food tho, such as:

 - SAKE BRAISED PORK BELLY AND GREEN ONION: its hard to mess up pork belly but this was actually done quite well. Two skewers but portions still more generous than i expected.
- SPICY SALMON: no detectable spiciness and the red pepper and mango overwhelm the fish. Not worth your stomach space.
- YUZU ICHIMI MUTSU: seaweed seasoning-dusted butterfish with pickled zucchini and plantain chips. This was unreal. Leave this for last and it'll undo any subpar items from the rest of your meal. You'll still leave content. Do it. 

The meal gets real expensive, real quick. Best to come with a company card ;) but service is excellent for the $$$ - attentive yet unobtrusive. Hard to say if I'll be back considering the price and noise level but not a bad option at all.

*they take this into account when seating you, so they are able to anticipate whether you need to be wined/dined and out by 7. Smart!"}
{"text":"Would be awesome if the cost was half.  Excellent service , nice room and good food BUT not 100 bucks a head nice."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh and innovative Japanese cuisine. Service was outstanding and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"- this review has nothing to do with the food or the drinks at ki
- it has everything to do with the douchy, snobby, and pretentious clientele it draws (sorry to everyone non-douchy who go there)
- i will never go here. ever."}
{"text":"Overpriced given the generally price-insensitive corporate crowd but above-average quality food. I'd recommend the Bistro Shrimp and sashimi. A good place to grab drinks after work."}
{"text":"Typical dark downtown business decor. Good for private meetings.  Food is very good. They have some imaginative rolls on the menu. Price is ok but a bit on the high side. I would go back but but I did not think it was anything special."}
{"text":"confirmation of my last review with +1 star:

took an american there who ordered 3 of the exact same custom rolls. the kitchen was happy to oblige and our server was great as usual. 

the ambiance is always good in the dining rooms - dimly lit, but food is still visible; very high ceilings; and usually, space/sound-cushioned conversations. and the fancy-schmancy is nice for special meals. 

walking through the lounge feels a bit slimy to me though. with the guy to girl ratio being nearly 3:1 most nights, vulturistic eyes appear to be always scanning, scanning, scanning...

after all of the above, the american echoed what i've said before about ki: it'd be 2-3 times the price in the U.S. how's that for a relative deal?"}
{"text":"My experience at Ki last night was fantastic! From the moment I walked in, everything was great. As I'm visiting from out of town, I asked the hostess what her biased thoughts on the place were. She said that although she may be biased, the place is absolutely wonderful. I took that for what it's worth since she works there, and promised to give her my review at the end of my dining experience. She sat me at the sushi bar, so I could  \"see the action\", and the experience began. My waiter was excellent. Everything he recommended was amazing. The Edamame-Pea Gazpacho was so good, I wanted a vat of it (but a bowl did just fine), and the Tempura Butterfish Makimono was amazing, light, fresh, and so delicious. I ended the night with a dessert of Matcha tea profiteroles that were creme puff heaven, with a pot of yummy Maple Rooibos tea. The best part - it was a reasonably modest price tag for a simply delightful meal. And the service was perfect as well. Thanks, Ki - I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. Beautiful decor. Very \"Nobu-esque\"!

By far the nicest Japanese restaurant in Toronto. Prices reasonable given the decor and the location. For those whining about the prices...they should stick with the rat-infested places on Spadina."}
{"text":"I recently had lunch at Ki with a group of nine colleagues.  We decided to let the restaurant decide on some appetizers, sashimi and sushi to share.  We were presented with a plethora of delicious choices, and there was something for everyone.  At around $40 per person, including non alcoholic drinks and tip, I think Ki was a good deal for the quality of food!

The pork belly appetizer skewers were crisp and perfectly done.  The sashimi platters featured the most tender tuna, salmon and butterfish.  The sushi was presented artfully, and had a nice variety.

Service was efficient, and we were in and out within the hour.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"If you want to be hit on by men in suits, this is the place to go!

Service was good.  We shared the tempura veggies and the sweet potato maki.  I like both, the mix of tempura veggies was really good, including beets, which I've never seen.  I had a glass of rose, which was advertised as $9 but came up on the bill as $10.  Everything is way overpriced, but the seats were comfy and I've heard it's much more happening when summer is over."}
{"text":"Expensive but not very memorable. The duck confit salad is lovely and I hear some of the cooked entrees are much better than the rolls. The sushi and rolls were just average. It's kind of dead on weekends, weekdays are busier with the post work crowd. Server was kind and offered some good suggestions. When we felt we ordered too much, she went and canceled our last entree with no issue. If you want a truly authentic sushi experience and are willing to spend a little more, try Hiro Sushi. Omakase style that is authentic and a foodie experience that you will always remember."}
{"text":"The star rating is for the food. Nothing very special but nothing really goes wrong. It is a place good for business gathering. Great variety for the drink menu and execellent service."}
{"text":"Meh. Another overpriced \"sushi\" place for yuppies- a toronto's take on nobu if you will. 
If you are going there on a date, fine. or even a business meeting or taking a client out. But don't go there for good sushi. It's overpriced and extremely uninventive. If you want high end sushi, please check out kaji or hiro. If you like 20 dollar spicy tuna rolls (how uninventive is that? spicy tuna rolls?! and 20 dollars?) by all means. 
The only thing I found to be remotely imaginative and actually really delicious was the miso chowder."}
{"text":"Not a typical Japanese sushi restaurant, but the food and ambience was wonderful."}
{"text":"First time I saw yam roll with yam on top...to leave space for asparagus. Creative but didn't taste any better than regular yam rolls, in fact the first ingredient in your mouth would have been greasy yam tempura, followed with plain avocado and asparagus. I don't appreciate this combination.

Same issue with the spicy salmon roll, plus the rice was hard.

One star to the service, we were served with hot hand towel which was thoughtful. The waitress poured sake for us, very nice too."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times.  Service was excellent last night, beer was cold and food was delicious.  I highly recommend the sweet potato roll...  it's a twist on sushi for the non raw fish eater.  The tuna roll was excellent too.  If you plan to get a seaweed salad, before to get a half order or plan to split it with someone.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I went to Ki today for a business lunch. From the other Yelp reviews, I was expecting a place that reeked of whiskey and testosterone -- but I'm pleased to report that it, indeed, did not smell. 

The food was good -- there was a bit of a wait, but it wasn't extraordinary for noon at a classy downtown place. The decor was nice, and the atmosphere was relaxed but businessy, perfectly suited for conversation and placid digestion. Our server was very nice and prompt.

I ordered the ki beef maki and the tempura butterfish, and both were really fantastic. The butterfish was particularly melt-in-your-mouth wonderful, and it was delicately fried in a crisp but light tempura batter. With some prodding, I ordered the chocolate truffle \"cake\" with Gran Marnier sauce -- while it was delicious and quite filling (orange and chocolate is definitely my favourite confectionary combination), it should really be described as a torte, as it's almost entirely a thick ganache. Don't order it and expect lava cake, which is what it sounds like.

Ki loses a star for two reasons: one, the relatively high price (a light lunch with small portions for 6 came to $250 plus tip), and two, the edamame. The executive who took us out ordered the spicy edamame for the table, which was pretty underwhelming -- not particularly well-salted or flavourful, but still good to snack on. It was also a bit less than crisp, and rapidly turned into a green, unbreakable leather as soon as it cooled off. 

I obviously didn't experience Ki in its late-evening hot-mess time, but the belt-loosening, sushi-stuffing experience I had there was very positive. Consider it the next time your boss buys you lunch."}
{"text":"*Sigh* I heart Ki... 
*Sigh* x2 

The food, service, ambiance, atmosphere. 
I heart it all. 

How visions of Ki dance in my head. 
Fresh Japanese sharing dishes, paired off with exquisite wine and never ending sake becomes the effortless evening known as dining at Ki. 

Sushi lover or non-sushi eater the Ki menu will not dare disappoint. 
Enjoyment for all - romance, bromance, girls night out. 

Don't miss out on these: 
Striploin Cubes 
Shrimp with wasabi garlic 
Rice Paper Shrimp fusion Japanese maki 
Beef Modern maki 

They all equal love. 

Expensive hang out or dine in worth every penny. 

Oh how I wish the bf would take me to Ki for V-day tomorrow. But boo to him. He's a nonbeliever of the hallmark holiday. 

So, anyone want a date to Ki tomorrow night? Cuz I'M YOURS!"}
{"text":"My partner and I came here for his birthday yesterday. We requested a more private table and were extremely pleased with our seating arrangements. 

The entire evening was phenomenal. The food was absolutely delicious. All the nigiri+sashimi were extremely fresh and tasty. The cold dishes were amazing. We had the sake, hamachi and sushi pizzas. All were decadent. We also ordered 2 makis, the tempura butterfish roll and California roll. We weren't too impressed with either. Although I was pleased that real crab was being used. I found the flavors in each of these rolls not to be too impressive in comparison to the fresh fish in the other items we ordered.

The service was impeccable. Our server came around often enough without interrupting too often. She recommended a warm sake that we both appreciated and even gave my partner a little take home for his birthday. 

A wonderful experience. That said, we spent nearly 200$ on this meal. It was a special occasion, so we didn't mind. I think fresh fish comes at a price and this one was appropriate. If you are a lover of sashimi and fresh fish I highly recommend this place. 

Thank you for such a good meal."}
{"text":"Honestly I wish I loved this place. It would be so convenient for frequent date spots. And it will never go out of business or strive to change its ways because of its location in Brookfield Place. But, this is a warning to all those who do not frequent the finance district who are mesmerized by the crowds that pour into this restaurant. The crowds are there because you are in the heart of Bay St finance and they have pretty much the only bar in the building. The food is nothing special, it is overpriced, and the portions are small. I am all for small portions and high prices if the flavours merit it. But the sushi is meh. The steaks are meh. The patio is nice. Have a drink with your girls or while you wait for your man. But a dining experience here leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Hip downtowner with well executed play on the familiar sushi/fusion genre. Service was outstanding. We had an excellent bottle of sake and a few interesting cocktails around the table. App highlights; sesame ribs, chicken drumettes and pork belly. I had a nice mix of sushi, including some good hotate. High quality fish is a given. They met the baseline, but the fish was not exceptional. For me, two things separates a top notch sushi experience; the rice and the temperature of the sushi at service. The folks at Ki should take a few trips down to NYC with those thoughts in mind if they want to elevate their game. Dining companions enjoyed their maki, pork ribs, short ribs and black cod. For me, not a destination, but would certainly recommend and go again."}
{"text":"This place is nice, but when I went...i found a piece of chicken bone by our table and the crowd was a bit too big-4 partner like and reeked of cheap perfume...(think there are call girls here).  

The food was alright, nothing too crazy about the sushi here.  Worth checking it out if you are in the mood for upscale sushi and feel like wasting your money."}
{"text":"I wanted to find a decent sushi place that focuses on quality and restaurant mood and stuff, which is when I came across this one. I made a reservation in the morning and there were still many seats available at 6PM. It eventually became crowded around 7-8pm.

1. Service
Can't complain. I went at 6pm on Saturday and servers provided water and everything at a timely polite matter with suggestions for dinner.

2. Mood/restaurant feel
The light is slightly dark but not too dark that people can chat fine and not too noisy. If you're looking for very crowded/lively kind of sushi restaurant feel, then this one might not be for you, but if you want to take someone for a date at a very fancy looking place for an experience, this restaurant's mood is for that. Not sure if this is for family with kids as the restaurant feels fancy with large chairs (and price is on the mid-high side that going ayce sushi is better for families). This place falls more under American style than Japanese style izakaya sushi bar, so keep that in mind if you want Japanese sushi bar feel. I also wore sort of semi business casual and indeed it's for business casual attire at least when I saw what everyone was wearing.

3. Food
We ordered tempura, and some sushi with spider roll. Overall, me and my friend were both satisfied, but as expected from these restaurants, you will be focusing on quality over quantity (at least I'd say there was quality), so if you want to fill your stomach with happiness at low price, this place might not be for you (or mix up some roll menus so that you eat with rice and fill up). 


In overall, I think this place is suitable if you want to
-business meetings and you want to show respect or high class feel at a modest price
-on a date and you want to go to somewhere fusion-feel

Would I come back here?
uhhhhhhhh probably not if for the food alone not because it was bad but because I want to try different options. The place is 3.5 but there is no 3.5 option on yelp."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! 

It's got a very lovely ambience to it. The service is spectacular and they make the best cocktails hands down. 

And might I add, (maybe it's just me) but every staff here is attractive and I mean every staff. 

Beautiful people and Positive Vibes all around"}
{"text":"This is one of Toronto's best restaurants.  The fish here is always first grade.  The staff are attentive.  The cellar features a very good range of traditional sakes, which are hard to come by elsewhere in this city.  This is of course a stomping ground for the Bay Street crowd, so no shortage of amusing conversations in the air.  Great for a quick lunch, an afternoon drink with colleagues, a Valentine's Day dinner - whatever it is you're in the mood for."}
{"text":"Great ambience and service, however the sushi itself was very mediocre. I wouldn't come back here as I could get much better sushi for a cheaper price.

However, if you're looking for an upscale place to enjoy your night and have some sushi, then I would recommend this place. I felt like you're paying for the atmosphere rather than the food ( not that the food was bad itself)"}
{"text":"High quality modern sushi restaurant with a cool atmosphere. Expensive but delicious. The butterfish roll was great!"}
{"text":"Ki is as elegant as the name is simple.  The tapas style fusion cuisine they offer is a fun way to have dinner and experience a number of courses that help to keep both the meal and the conversation interesting.  It is in the heart of the financial district so you'll have to put up with the typical swagger of the banking and broker crowd, but if you don't mind that it's a great meal with friends and even better for a date."}
{"text":"Had spicy tuna roll (mmmmmm), seasonal veg tempura (liked the beets & the sweet pot, mushroom wasn't my cup of tea), butterfish (was lovely and fresh). We were seated away from all the action, so if you want a good table I guess you have to request it. 
Prices were reasonable. 
Good place after work on Thursday to see & be seen."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience.

I have been looking forward to this mysterious restaurant for a while.  All dark outside with a bright red label spelling KI - makes you think this restaurant is hot, hot, hot.  However, it was old and boring.  The menu was overwhelming - has so much potential but too pretentious for my liking.

The crowd was just after work finace guys, who clearly go there to scout but then it dies down by like 7 - becuase I don't think anyone understand the menu.  The atmosphere was just confused.  Didn't jive.

Got the Spicy Tuna Roll - this was the best part - it was delicious but nothing too special and the only thing I understood."}
{"text":"Meh is the best I can describe this place. Strangest seaweed salad I've ever had, so-so chicken teriyaki. The caramel dessert was excellent, but not enough to make me want to head back. Terrible service, took 25 minutes for the waiter to bring us our bill, and that was only after one of us went to look for him."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. Fairly expensive and simple menu but tremendous food and service. A real treat."}
{"text":"Sure, come for the sushi; they taste great and are rolled tightly. But you can't come here and NOT order the pork belly appetizer...this dish will convert ANY vegan!  it's a staple amongst the Japanese (and Asian) cuisine but seems to be absent from most Japanese restaurants in the area. In any case, Ki's version is finished on the grill and served on skewers. The pork belly simply melts in your mouth. There's no need for any sauces but one is provided. This dish should be on everyone's bucket list if it doesn't kill you first.  The garlic fried rice is also very good...simple, yet flavorful and a great compliment to the pork belly.  Ki's beef short ribs are also very good (a small mound piled in a bowl on top of a soy borth) but are no comparison to the pork belly.  I can't say it enough...pork belly, pork belly, PORK BELLY!!!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was different than most sushi places I have frequented before. Company was good which really is THE only reason I would ever go to an over-priced establishment like this. Food was decent. Nothing more. Will not be returning on my own accord."}
{"text":"If you can find room on the patio, it's a great spot to enjoy some delicious apps/dinner and drinks after work and the fact they have Veuve by the glass warms my heart that much more. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing place located in financial district Toronto. 
The place is beautiful, it introduces you with the upscale to Japanese food culture. The place has a diverse menu, which each of the dishes is cooked excellent.
The atmosphere is unique and welcoming. 
The service is impeccable. 

Highly recommended, referring to my experience."}
{"text":"Do I really have to write a review of this place?

I mean, it's so ubiquitous and it's so well known what you're going to get.

Good environment, great food, good service, modest portions and high prices.  On Thursdays, the bar is packed with people and it's commonly known as \"gold digger' night in the financial core both here and at O&B.  You can figure out why.

Everything actually tastes pretty good here.  From all the crispy but not over-breaded tempuras to the flavorful spiced meats.  The sushi is pretty good too and they have some items with unique twists (which is what, often, I look for).  The service has been quite good since they have a decent staff-to-patron ratio.  The environment is classy and there's lots of different areas you can sit in.

I remember wanting a bit more on the dessert menu, but I couldn't really complain.  All in all, if you have some cash to spend and want a great Japanese place, you'll never regret going here."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and, despite the negative reviews, we had a blast. We had the Valentine's Day menu with the sashimi add on. 

Fish was fresh and had wonderful textures that I haven't found yet around Toronto, even JaBistro. The fresh and mild wasabi was spectacular and probably the only time I've ever really enjoyed wasabi. 

The best part was the miso braised pork belly. So crunchy and delicious. A total must try. 

Presentation was really nice and you can tell the chefs put a lot of effort into it. The staff know a lot about the food and are really friendly. Especially our waiter Christian. Great guy, super knowledgable and just made our experience very pleasant."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! Beautiful Restaurant.  Delicious food but pricey and portions are small, still worth it! Perfect service, I highly recommend.  Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Pricey but enjoy everytime

Fusion dishes are great

Use to go every week but now live too far for the drive

Glad to see them still there"}
{"text":"This place is soooo good. Came here on the recommendation of a friend who has also lived in Japan. While the sushi and sashimi were apparently mediocre (I didn't have any of the latte), the fusion dishes were an interesting and bold mix of Japanese tradition and technique with more local ingredients and flavours. 
 
My favourite was the creamy miso chowder and the tofu and eggplant glazed with aka miso. Oooh.. and seaweed salad with goma and wakame dressing."}
{"text":"Ki is a very trendy Bay street restaurant. However the atmosphere and the service is great. The food is above average sushi, as far as trendy sushi goes.  

My biggest complaint is that some of the modern takes on the dishes, takes away from the quality of the highlights of the dish. For example the Toro dish which was wrapped in a vegetable type taco, tasted much better when the tuna sushi me was eaten on its own."}
{"text":"Menu is extensive and good.  However, they often bring out food in the wrong order.  Servers are always professional and pleasant.  Quite expensive and although the ambiance nice the room is getting to be a bit dated. I like it as a high end Japanese option."}
{"text":"Really cool spot. Was super quiet when we went which was actually really nice. I guess we got there pretty late. Service was awesome and the food was incredible. Loved the sushi and the mini cheeseburgers were off piste but delicious. Staff were incredibly accommodating as we were a large group and we arrived late. Big thank you!"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to coming to this place for a really long time and I was very disappointed by the quality of the food, the interior Decor, and even the service. Would never come back. Sushi was mediocre at best. Sashimi was good, but how can you mess that up.."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my girlfriend. Located in the financial district the crowd definitely seemed very corporate (business lunches?) with all the suits. 

Prices were a bit steep for lunch (app+2mains+dessert $100+). Rolls were mediocre but the sashimi was very fresh and the service was amazing!

Unfortunately I didn't get to take a photo but the sea bass main was cooked perfectly and their scallop sashimi is a must try if you're a fan of scallops."}
{"text":"Amazing food, exceptional service.

I travel all over the world and have been lucky enough to enjoy restaurants and meals that would otherwise elude me on expense. While I stay fed I'm rarely truly impressed. That said, I was actually excited to come \"home\" to the Westin in Calgary tonight to write this review.

Simply put, Ki is one of the best places I have been for sushi in recent memory. And, I've recently been to some good North American sushi cities (Seattle, Vancouver, San Francisco). I am beyond shocked that here in Alberta, I would be so entirely pleased with my sushi and service. The ikura was quite good, and the jalapeno hamachi (yellowtail) is the kind of thing I'll think about for weeks. The omakase tako and sake dishes were winderful (underlined). All recommendations from my servers were spot on. The fact that the uni which I craved was not of sufficient quality to escape the scrutiny of the sushi chefs and make it to my plate did not go unnoticed.

There was minor drama when I checked in: my coworker fell ill (the result of a 15+ hour business meeting combined with hard living and hypoglycemia). The staff could not have been more discreet and attentive while attending to him. When he ultimately left the restaurant to return to the hotel, this same staff was very attentive to me without being overbearing or cloying.
 
I like to write a review that tells you exactly which and whose section you should be sitting in, and I'd like to tell you that  you can't go wrong with Jessica, Simon, and Apostolo. Simon will make you smile, Jessica will make you feel right at home (in a way that I'd think of as fancy unpretension), and Apostolo (I swear we're not related or dating) has a truly special gift of hospitality, and has basically assured that I will most certainly be back whenever I am lucky enough to be in Calgary.

While I found the service here to be absolutely superlative, please also remember that the food is not too shabby. I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"The tempura butterfish roll is just hands down amazing. These rolls just melted in your mouth. I also had a chance to try the Ki Beef Maki, which was really good. I've heard good things about the 'Spicey Avocado' as well. A modern twist to sushi. 

The menu is pretty pricey and that would be my only negative comment.

{"text":"At the beginning of the month, I made a reservation to celebrate for my boyfriend's 25th birthday. It was slightly hard to get to with all the construction and the rain that day didn't help but walking into the restaurant makes it all worth it. 
The place is spacious; long halls for seating, a special area for booths and the bar area. The lights are dimmed, making a dark but intimate atmosphere. We sat in one of the booths and for two people, it's huge! I love the touch of water to the side of our booth, there was a man-made, miniature stream that made its way next to us which created even more of a romantic atmosphere. 
Our appetizer was the Creamy Miso Chowder. It has seafood - probably crab, lobster, some clams, not too sure - these chives and a pair of biscuits that laid on top while drizzled with truffle oil. I loved this soup. The biscuits - I assume the wakame? - melted with the chowder which made the soup less heavy than what normal chowders tend to get. It was very smooth. The bits of seafood made the soup as well and while very warm, it hit the spot especially since we were coming back from the rain that day. 
Our pick of sushi was first the Tempura Butterfish. It consisted of alaskan king crab, salmon, butterfish, avocado, cucumber with tempura crusted around the seaweed. We were very hungry so we gobbled these up instantly. They were small pieces of six. The amount of seafood was good but it was hard to taste the vegetables because of the tempura though. It was a very good dish, but not to great caliber. 
Second was the Dynamite Roll. You probably had this in another restaurant; tempura shrimp, mayo, seaweed and cucumber. It is a staple to eat whenever my boyfriend and I go out. As usual, very good but nothing special since it was like the same as anywhere else. I didn't detect a Ki twist. 
We also ordered a side of sweet potatoes with kabayaki sauce. You can't go wrong with sweet potatoes. It sates my craving every time I eat them and this wasn't anything different. It tastes like a regular sweet potato but the sauce changes everything. It has a bit of a kick which for someone like me, can't take spice lightly but this was not overwhelming. My only issue is that I feel like I spend my money more on the sauce than the sweet potatoes themselves. 
Next, we got the Wok-Tossed Tiger Shrimp which had crispy rice and red pepper. To be honest, not that I haven't been in this review, this was one of the best items on the menu. There are a myriad of flavours that accompany it with every bite. It hard not to ask for more. I would personally order four of these just to eat. The sauce seems to melt in your mouth and the crispy rice contrasts it but not in a bad way. You taste sweetness from the shrimp, bitterness from the pepper, sour from the sauce. Never really tried something like this before so it is safe to say that this was a pleasant surprise of tastes. 
We didn't feel up to have dessert, we don't usually have it so we order a round of Mutsu, or butterfish. I love this fish. It has a smooth taste to it and it's not slimy like some sashimi can be. This is probably my favourite bit out there. I suggest adding this to the roster whenever you feel like eating a la carte. 
We wrapped up by watching the basketball game at the bar that night. The atmosphere of it is very laid-back and let us stay to watch the game after we paid for our food. They gave us a round of waters and a couple actually watched the game behind us. 
The staff and service was very accommodating. I think this is the strong suit of Ki. They let me move to sit next to my boyfriend because the booth was so big. Our waitress even took a few pictures of us so we wouldn't have to take the awkward and gruelling selfie. She had us at the booth and suggested to take a picture of us in front of this huge gong at the front of the other end of the restaurant. The bus boy and our waitress helped us out with our food, serving us water and plum wine which I recommend anywhere if you have never tried it. Even staff who didn't directly serve was didn't hesitate to answer our questions or help us out in anyway. Overall, the people were friendly. 
This is definitely a place where you would want to take your date. Super comfortable and super fancy - you don't need to act all stuffy like a preconceived Rich-body."}
{"text":"This place is good for business lunches - good location, nice decor, but fairly pricey. We had dinner there last Saturday around 7 pm.  It was not busy.  Food is good (pan Asian), sushi is good.  Our favourite sushi places are:  Zen restaurant (on Woodbine north of Steeles) and Inatei in Markham (on Leslie north of Highway 7)."}
{"text":"Pricey but delicious food and drinks. Loved the Hamachi + Jalapeño with fresh slices ginger + yuzu shoyu and warm sake."}
{"text":"I came here many years ago when it first opened and there were not that many Japanese modern restaurants. I was here again on a Tuesday for drinks around 830 pm. The interior is as I remembered. We got a table at the bar area, a number of tables were open. There were people finishing up dinner in the main dining room. The crowd is mature likely from the financial district. The bar menu had a selection of cocktails, sake, wine and beer. We were surprised that there was no Japanese plum wine available. We ordered the Japanese mule, very light and refreshing. Also ordered the nigiri sushi plate, salmon and unagi nigiri, kiwi tuna roll. Sushi was nicely presented. The sushi tasted standard and as expected. Pricey for two drinks and a few sushi appetizers. Didn't try the entrees from the menu but I see the menu remains the same over the years.  Overall nice drink place with good selection of sushi appetizers. It's a drink place for me only. Since this opening many other new restaurants on the sushi scene in Toronto that are worth your attention."}
{"text":"i was craving sushi so i had to try Ki, well, def not the top tier fish..
Maybe i am al little tough to please when it comes to fresh sushi, i did grow up in Vancouver and my love for sushi did start at tender age of 5..
rolls were pretty good, clean flavors, and service was great!
will go back for drinks and appi only next time!!"}
{"text":"We had delicious food, my black cod was absolutely tender, the tempura chicken great. Edamame really tasty and fresh, short perfect. The best was our great server, Holly! We dropped in and were most welcome!"}
{"text":"It was difficult for me to give this place 4 stars.  However, it was probably better than any 3 star sushi joint so there's my reasoning.
Four of us went for lunch and ended up pretty full on two orders of sashimi and five rolls, all for about $95.00.  This place has some pretty inventive rolls so if \"Big-eye Tuna and apple is your dream combo then they have about eight like that.  We tried the Kiwi tuna and the Spicy salmon with the aforementioned apple.  Both were good, but nothing I would specifically come back for.  The Dynamite rolls were typical but very good.  We also ordered the Spicy Tuna roll which was good as well but everybody's least favorite.  The Sockeye sashimi was very good and the Tako was ok.
All in all a pretty good meal."}
{"text":"Came here for a biz lunch recently.  It definitely screams power lunch destination between the high-ceilings, wood paneling and jacked-up prices.  I had the edamame, miso soup and sushi/sashimi special.  The food was pretty good, but nothing remarkable.  I can't even remember any highlights to share.  I will the service is first-rate.  My glass of water and cup of green tea were always refilled.  They handled our order with promptness and grace.  I just wish the food was better, especially for the price."}
{"text":"Excellent peppercorn striploin. It was beautiful in its simplicity of just wholesome red meat cooked to a slightly-charred-on-the-outside perfection with simple peppercorn sauce. Then a side of grilled asparagus and mushroom which was, once again, beautifully simple. I could taste the inherent flavors of both vegetables even when accompanied by a light, flavorful soy-blend sauce. It's a lovely change from food that has been so dunked/battered/fried in something that one can't taste the real flavors. 
The cocktails were excellent. The Manhattan was lovely and at the bottom of the glass, had a wonderfully smoky taste. 
I also head something that was creamy/citrusy. My friend had something infused with lavender which was awful. It tasted far too much like herbs (very medicinal/overpowering)."}
{"text":"Food was NOT good, especially considering the price being $7-10 per 2 pieces of sushi. Fish portion on nigiri was small and there was no eel sauce on our unagi...needless to say pretty disappointed. Spent $70 for two people on a less than satisfactory meal."}
{"text":"Sooooo delicious!

I went for dinner here last weekend, and everything about the meal was perfect.  Attentive servers, amazing food.  I really liked the tapas style with share plates - everyone in the group picked a couple of things, and we just passed plates around.  Their sushi is to die for!  The prices are on the spendy side, but it is an upscale restaurant and worth it for a nice evening!"}
{"text":"Ki is very nicely decorated on the interior and I find the people that work at Ki are very professional. I came here a date personally its a really nice setting but after work a lot of people come here for drinks so it 
was quite loud. 

We ordered quite a bit of food. 

Kiwi-Tuna
yellowfin tuna, mango, cucumber, spicy tomato salsa, topped with Kyoto miso - MUST TRYY!

Spicy Salmon
Atlantic salmon, asparagus, endive, spicy raspberry sauce, ao noriko - wasn't a fan of the asparagus but the spicy raspberry sauce was surprisingly really good.

B.C. Tuna + Chives
with kimchee lime sauce + sesame seeds

and we ordered most of the sashimi. It was all really fresh and it was sooo yummy :D"}
{"text":"The lounge area was pretty happening even on a Tuesday night.  Co-worker and I enjoyed the scenery and the kung fu on tv, while imbibing a few Sapporos and trying a suite of steak skewers, california roll with side spicy relish and spicy raspberry salmon maki finishing with the shrimp entree.  The shrimp were great, almost closer to Mexican Arrabiata.  The decor was decent and nicely dim but not too dimly lit, even the ceiling has the Japanese paper walls.

Of course, the portions were small,  now I see why street vendors do so well here.  I think I'll top off all my dinners with a German sausage..."}
{"text":"It's an alright sushi place in downtown but there's better. When you walk in, it's very dimly lit and has a romantic date night feel. The front staff are very helpful and nice. 

Now the food is ok. The Sushi has a more westernized taste. Fish is fresh but the menu is overpriced for what it is. The yuzu creme Brulee dessert we had was pretty good. Almost tasted like key lime pie. Overall a decent place but there's definitely better places for cheaper."}
{"text":"Très bon resto de sushi, service impeccable. Si comme moi vous aimez les surprises, demander au serveur(euse) d'y aller avec l'inspiration du moment. Mais attention, la facture grimpe en fonction de votre appétit.
Nous avons également eu notre première formation saké 101. 
La morale de cette soirée: \"saké, ça fesse\""}
{"text":"Yummerific. Great food + great atmosphere + great service = an convert?

I've never had sushi this good before. That said, I've never paid this much for sushi before either. 

The server was knowledgable about the choices on the menu, and was able to make some perfect suggestions for one in our party who was a little more conservative (read steak and potatoes sort of girl.). 

After an enjoyable meal, we were treated to a chipotle after-dinner chocolate creation in a little origami box. Nice touch."}
{"text":"This is a fit for purpose restaurant.  I come here often due to the proximity to work.  Great atmosphere, fast service and the food taste good.  I love their garlic rice!"}
{"text":"Yeah yeah, it's pretty inside and they have all these funky rolls but the fish is just not quality and the price is crazy. If you want good sushi, forget it. If you want a cool place to hang and try some \"interesting\" fusion rolls. Okay."}
{"text":"When here with my sister for her birthday. The meal was very good and the service was excellent. Our host gave us a sampling of a few different sakes for free which was a very nice surprise.

I would be happy to dine here again."}
{"text":"Owned by the same company that runs The Keg, this Sushi-Fusion bar/restaurant is one of those over priced \"seen and be seen\" type places that we have smattered around in the business district of Toronto.  Real mover's and shakers don't come here it's the wanna-be trendy crowd who have donned on their one designer outfit for the Thursday Night patio in order to perhaps connect with another wanna be consultant or accountant.  Right in the heart of banking, accounting, consulting and legal companies -  Ki is primarily an EXPENSE account type place where everyone kind of goes as you know you can get a table quick, food is decent and you are NOT paying as it is on your Company expense account.

Have to agree with the person who wrote \"I can't stand this place mostly for the schmoozy, wheeling-dealing meet-market vibe on Thursday nights (and most days)\"

I worked in an office near this place and as I headed to my fancy cottage up North on a Friday I would look at all the Schmoozy wanna be's and take pity on their $200+ bar tabs and over priced Japanese food.  

Only go here if:
- you want to be seen by other superficial office peeps
- you have your company paying (as most peeps expense their food here as it is the office crowd and honestly there is much better eating to be had in Toronto for the pricepoint).

Food: 4
Price: 3 (as it is over priced)...however, someone is going to have to pay for the expensive realestate the restaurant stand on .....and that someone is YOU the person eating there

I have gone a ton of times for business.  However, would NEVER go there on my own dime."}
{"text":"Not sure if I can provide an accurate review since I've only been there once couple years ago. My friend took me there after work since he works nearby. He's been there several times before and thought the food was okay. We ordered enough food for three because we were really curious about the offerings on the menu... big mistake, the food was very mediocre in my opinion, the fish weren't especially fresh, the presentation wasn't especially amazing... what's worse, the beautiful waitress actually brought all of our food at once... it was just daunting (i guess we shouldn't have ordered so much, but was it really necessary to bring everything at once? It was only 5 or 6, the restaurant was only half full)... At any rate, it was \"not great\" to the point that we didn't even finish half of the food we ordered. I think there was a roasted pork dish that we each had a piece of and didn't want to touch again. Oh well, I didn't have to pay for the meal so I guess it could have been worse"}
{"text":"It's actually pretty good sushi, super quick, always had room, good servers and good sushi. Not sure why the ratings are so low!"}
{"text":"Goregous interior! A little on the pricey side, but it's only because it caters to the Bay Street workers... so you pay for the location. But, the sushi was fantastic and the lounge area was crowded as well. 

I came with my boss and some co-workers, and we were definitely well served and our waiter was helpful in the recommendations. We sat parallel to Bay Street, and there was a small stream next to the booth that you might not even notice, except our waiter warned us (a few times). It definitely added ambiance, but I had to remind myself not to exit on the right!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with a client last night at Ki. The service and sushi were great. We started with the Edamame and Bistro Shrimp (spicy wasabi dip is excellent) followed by spicy salmon, tempura butterfish, Ki beef maki, and dynamite rolls. The dynamite roll was probably my personal favorite. 

The one downside to Ki is that it is a hangout for suits in the financial district. We had a reservation so we didn't have a problem, but overall the place was packed. Additionally the noise level was extremely loud. 

Food trumps the crowd and noise in my mind however. I'll definitely return once I try all of Toronto's other fine restaurants."}
{"text":"Ki has amazing sushi! I am a sushi freak so when i say good sushi - it means GOOD SUSHI! I don't really know about the rest of the food as i havent had anythign else but i keep on hearing its great! 
Service is pretty good too. Helpful and friendly. Food arrived extremely fast! 
The funny part of this place is their bar scene. LOL. Me and my friend were joking about it the other day. Here's how it works. You have a whole bunch of single 30-somethings who come to Ki religiousely not to eat but to hang out by the bar. 30-something single women are trying to get picked up by 30 something men. 30 something men see occasional 20-something girls and naturally pick them up over the ladies their own age. 20-something girls surely accept free drinks from these older men and then get dirty looks from 30 something women who are pissed that their men pick a younger generation. 

Sad.. but funny to watch :)"}
{"text":"The service is very attentive, given the price of the drinks at the bar. 

I had the house ceasar 2.0 and costs $14. This specialty drink is a fancier version of the casears at your average pub (ie. special miso base.) The server came by twice in the span of 30 minutes to see if we needed refills on our drinks.

Since we did not get to the bar until 10:30 pm on a Tuesday, it was quite busy with a very corporate feel. I think there was a party of some sort being held. The atmosphere was lit lightly but you could still carry on a conversation with your group (ie. the music was not too loud).

The convenience of this restaurant must be factored in as it is at Brookfield Place which is steps away from Union station."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant that fit's the Bay st local.  The wait and host staff were nice but no where did we see or hear from a manager.  I enjoyed the fusion of traditional Japanese dishes with western ingredients but it didn't blow me away.   

I was put off when I asked the server if I could just have a hamachi and cucumber maki roll and was told \"I don't think we can do that...\"   It showed up anyway, unfortunately she got the request wrong, as it came inside out.  Your take away from this is this is not a spot that focuses on the food but more for ambiance, scene and just being different with the cuisine.   

I may bring clients back here but won't come back as a personal choice for Japanese fusion."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS. Modern, Open-Air, Chic Decor, Warm Breeze, Earl-type servers. Food was good. Presentation was better. Portions were non-generous. Price? Expen$$$ive. Fun for the summer. After that...I'd rather go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Delish sushi and japanese-ish food. The miso chowder is awesome. I would give it 5 stars alone. The rolls, sashimi and other are great - with new and interesting flavours without the same ole kinda sushi varieties. Non sushi eaters can have the sirloin roll and sweet potato wedges which are devine. or the tempura veggies. The eggplant tempura is particularly interesting and yummy. Overall great. Dark and quiet atmosphere. Nice place for a meeting or a work lunch. 

Im updating this review... still a 4star plus.  I had the salmon teriyaki bento box today with work people. We all really enjoyed oir meal. I forgot that is a solid restaurant. The shrimp tempura were delish to share-as was the calamari. They even can do gluten free tempura. One of the ladies in our group was a celiac and she was so excited. Great lunch. All were happy. And a final note-when the waiter made a mistake he quickly took off my meal even though I had soup and salad to eat and didnt miss my main at the time. Classy."}
{"text":"Exelent food and service i have no complain at all we coming from LA we have an exigent taste this place is good"}
{"text":"If I'm correct in remembering, this is the place that tried to charge me $7 for a bowl of steamed white rice with my entree... Ouch! Glad I asked and turned this down, but they probably get many people this way."}
{"text":"The servers are great, always smiling and providing recommendations. Good food, great place for a social drink after the long hours in the office or a celebratory setting after closing a big deal."}
{"text":"My partner and I had our first date here. We loved it so much we come back to Toronto every year to celebrate our anniversary and we always come back to Ki.

If you read my reviews, you will know that I love quality service. This place delivers. They must have a a database in their computer system because they knew we have been there in the past 3 years and they know why we come back. When we arrived they gave us complimentary glasses of champagne, and a card congratulating us for our anniversary. I was blown away. The wait staff were attentive and fantastic. There was always someone coming by to make sure we had enough water or to refill our wine glasses. When you leave, they come by and refold your napkin. Details, details, details!

Now the restaurant would be not be good if the food was not good. It doesn't matter how amazing the service is if the food is poor. Luckily, Ki has fantastic food. Every time we have gone, we were always happy with the quality of food, and its presentation. The alcohol selection is fantastic. If you like sake, you'll want to come here.

The restaurant is wonderfully designed - very modern, very nice atmosphere. While you don't have to wear a suit, you certainly won't feel out of place wearing one.

I love this place and plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Now don't get me wrong. I enjoy the AYCE sushi trend. Strap on the feed bag. I have no shame. But where do you go if you want to have sushi and impress a date? What if she's wearing a slinky little black dress? And she has the cutest Bay street professional woman bob you've ever seen? 

Nami? I haven't been there since the Reagan/Bush years. 

Ki is a dark, romantic sushi restaurant in BCE Place (which might have changed names since the Reagan/Bush years). It doesn't over do the Japanese theme. There's a weird waterless \"river\" table side. Our waiter assured us the \"river\" ran with actual water normally. When we dined, it was more like a zen rock path. What is the sound of one river clapping? If a river falls in a Financial District restaurant, does it make a babbling brook sound? 

There are some different nigiri pieces on the menu. Fluke, which might be better known as flounder, caught our attention. Flounder is a staple of Korean sashimi. They pluck the living flounders right out of tanks in front of little back alley sashimi restaurants. But in Toronto, you don't see so many flat fish on your run-of-the-mill sushi restaurants.

Service is attentive and oddly occidental. Ki treats sushi as the world cuisine it's become today. Much like you walk into Pizza Pizza without the pretense the place is run by real live Italians or someone from New York. 

Ki is huge but feels small and intimate. It's only when you hunt for the washroom do you realize its size. It was actually empty for a Saturday night. My uber cute date assured me it's not a bad sign. Ki is packed at lunch and apres work.

The sweet potato wedges with wasabi mayo are pretty awesome. You get a hearty bowl."}
{"text":"Overall it was okay - the presentation was well executed - the flavors landed somewhere between good and too adventurous.  Some of the decors though trendy and modern looked worn.  There are many other options offering better value."}
{"text":"Meh. This place is decent but really expensive. If you are into high prices and average service this place is for you. It's ok, but other sushi options in the city. 

3.0/5 *"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, awesome Sushi, outstanding service... We ordered different types of Sushi, Flat Iron Steak, Soups and Cream Caramel, all were great, tasty, fresh, prepared to perfection. The waiter was very professional and friendly, he was all over the table at all times with lots of recommendations and also brought us some  food and dessert samples. We will definitely go back. Thanks Ki team."}
{"text":"I do NOT think they even know what the Japanese food is. The servers does not even have any knowledge of Japanese food. They should change their restaurant name to \"Ki Bistro & Modern Bar\", Without \"Japanese\" in it."}
{"text":"This past summer, I had the chance to visit Ki Modern Japanese + Bar for dinner located in the Financial District of Toronto. I was excited to try this restaurant after hearing great reviews from friends about the taste and quality of their food. From the exterior to the interior of the restaurant, the place was beautifully designed with a relaxed atmosphere in the dining area. Our waitress was very attentive and made sure we had a pleasurable dining experience. Their menu was designed for sharing among friends and so we ordered a variety of dishes to try out

Their Bistro Shrimp came out hot and fresh, and had the perfect amount of batter. Usually other Japanese restaurants coat the batter really thick making the tempura greasy, but this wasn't the case at Ki. From their Ki Signature Plates we ordered the Grilled Beef Striploin Tataki and the Tai with Truffle Oil, which was suggested by the waitress. The Tataki was slightly grilled around the edges and thinly sliced. The texture was nice and soft, almost melting in our mouths. The Tai, sea bream, was beautifully presented and tasted very fresh with the Cranberry Ponzu. These two dishes are definitely a must-have when visiting Ki. The sashimi we ordered included Hamachi yellowtail, Mutsu butterfish and Maguro bigeye tuna. Each order came out with 4 large pieces, enough for two people to share. The sashimi was delicious and definitely high quality. And from the Classic and Ki Modern Makimonos, we ordered Spicy Tuna, Lobster and Ki Beef Maki, which all tasted wonderful. 

Ki is a great place if you want to try an upscale Japanese fusion restaurant for casual dining with friends or for a special occasion. Their menu is quite pricey but it's worth it for the quality of food you're getting. Overall, we had a great experience at Ki and will definitely be coming back in the future to try out other great dishes!"}
{"text":"I saw this place while leaving Marchè one night and was determined to return here. On the final night of my 2-week stint in Toronto my coworker and I made it here. I'm so glad that we did. I love the atmosphere of the place. We sat in the lounge and were surrounded by nothing but mature, well-dressed people. The waitresses were beautiful, friendly and very experienced with the menu. I had the ginger-fried chicken, butterfish and tuna kabobs. They all had MUCH fancier names, but for the sake of this review, I used the lame-man's terms. Everything was FANTASTIC and decently priced. I would love to have brought a date here or to try coming on a Saturday night instead of a Thursday. The place was awesome."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best sushi spots I've been too. They have a beef roll which is uniquely delightful. My fav was the butterfish roll though. Try them both. Great set up and location!"}
{"text":"Beautiful outdoor patio and happy hour scene.  My favorite dish is the black cod, with salmon roe in orange reduction.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Two people for dinner - Sashimi (king crab, sea urchin, sweet shrimp, yellowfin, etc.) and some hot food (tempura, steak)

I don't normally talk about price, but you are definitely paying for location and decor. Two people with no alcohol came to $180 before tip, just some matcha tea to finish it off ($10 per bowl, they've switched from the traditional tea ceremony getup).

Service was fine, crowd was surprisingly non-suit in the evening. 

The main reason for 3* is it's definitely a place to impress a date, the interior booths have a small river running across the table....very romantic. It can be 5pm but the inside will be dark, a rarity in Toronto."}
{"text":"I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that Ki is mostly catered towards the downtown executive class and guests that are staying at the Westin (which is right beside it). I can totally picture contracts being signed here, or tourists coming in after a day trip in Banff and a strong craving for sushi. So I'm going to have to give my review with that assumption firmly rooted at the back of my mind.

This is a fantastic restaurant. The service is impeccable; the presentation and atmosphere even more so. Looking like we were ready to order but with our waiter nowhere to be seen, the host came up to us to confirm if we were ready so he could call our waiter.

As the other reviews state, there are hot water towels; they do pour the gluten-free, low-sodium soya sauce and the water often - but non-intrusively. They give out complimentary samples of sushi/sashimi. They have thick and soft disposable wipes in the bathroom inscribed with their logo. It's a pretty fancy place.

The most important part, however, is how their food delivers. For a group of four, we shared four makimono rolls (six pieces each) and the chicken teriyaki (which is also a small plate). Their specialty is Japanese fusion, so the kiwi tuna roll for example, had a hint of mango and spicy salsa to it. An enjoyable mix of sweet, sour and spicy. The futomaki (with unagi and spinach) tasted incredible as well. 

These are not huge portions, true; but they are just enough (we went in there famished, but still walked away satisfied albeit not overly full). 

I quite enjoyed my dinner here. In the end, the bill wasn't even that bad for our group of four (we didn't have appetizers, drinks or desserts).

If I went on a date where somebody else is paying (and I was craving sushi), this would definitely be on top of my list."}
{"text":"Unique and creative? Yes. Authentic? Probably not. High quality food? Yes. Reasonably priced? Definitely not. Good decor? Yes. Good for conversations? Typically not.

As you can tell, I've got somewhat mixed feelings about this place. First off, do yourself a favour and avoid this place on Thursday nights when the banker crowd is down here in full force. Walk through the bar area then and you might catch the eyes of a cougar on the prowl or some sleazy old dude trying to coyly slip away their wedding ring. And whenever there's a Leafs game, it gets pretty packed.

Other than that, it's not so bad. The food is pretty good - fresh, creative, tasty, and overall just high quality. It's just not worth the price. And if you're really looking for a truly good sushi experience, there are many better places in Toronto to go for that."}
{"text":"Honestly, if it wasn't for the beautiful contemporary atmosphere and the soft red couches, I would not eat here again. Ki is more fitted for the busy rush of happy hour patrons, to enjoy a few cocktails.....or tea.

I ordered a 6 piece Butterfish tempura roll and sweet potato wedges. Expecting large pieces of sushi, I was instead served a typical ayce sushi roll for fourteen dollars!!! It was a good thing I ordered the sweet potato wedges or else I would be starving by the time I left.

Service was adequate, but not memorable. Although be warned of the bitchy coat check ladies..."}
{"text":"Great location, but horrible food.  

Came here for lunch with a friend as it is conveniently located in the same building as my office.  I ordered Daily Sushi + Sashimi Platter from the lunch menu.  The platter came with a small side of soba noodles for $24.  With that price tag, I was actually expected the platter to have at least one or two pieces of premium sashimi included.  Not only non of that was in the platter (they only have the typical sushi), but the sushi was not that fresh at all.  They tasted the ones you would get at a AYCE japanese restaurant.  

Service was just alright, nothing too outstanding considering the price we pay.  

Dont think I will ever be coming back.  I would rather go to the sushi places in the food court.  They probably have fresher sushi with a more reasonable price tag."}
{"text":"This restaurant's food was amazing! The atmosphere was high class and our server was fun and amazing. Keep it in mind though that this is fine dinning so it's a little pricey, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"I think I've found my favorite restaurant in all of Calgary. From the moment I walked in the hostess was so nice and accommodating and helped me find a lovely table to study at with a plug (my MCATs tomorrow).

I love the atmosphere and decor here and the service is great. Everyone is really friendly and the food is good too. The seaweed salad was light but large and a wonderful end to my spa day. 

They also brought me out cute little treats which is definitely appreciated during my last few hours. 

Definitely recommend this place to study or come for drinks with friends! (Plus it's the best Japanese restaurant in Calgary)"}
{"text":"We went for lunch @ Ki.  My impression: fancy restaurant and pretty darn expensive.  Service was high-class.  Hot towel service to wipe your hands before eating.  Also, I've never had my low-sodium soya sauce poured out for me before!  My pet peeve:  my lunch arrived about 5 minutes later than the other 2 at my table.  

I had the sushi/sashimi platter which costs $23.  5 pieces of sushi, 2 small rolls, some tempura yam on a tiny bit of salad, and the sashimi was the smallest cuts I've ever seen!  They are like 1 inch long and 1/3 inch wide!!  Really, really tiny.  What is with the tiny gob of wasabi!  I had to flag down the waiter again to get more wasabi as I like my wasabi.  I rate a Japanese restaurant by its sashimi and the size matters!!  

Not too sure if I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Location seems very central -- we're from out of town so relies on yelp and opentable to get a table. We got an 8pm reservation, a table by the window, and were surrounded by a lovely bunch so the ambiance was great. The menu is very desirable - so many good things to choose from, but the scallops and tiger prawns were the best! The hot sake at $14 for 12oz makes for wonderful shots to sip as well. Christan was an amazing server : from Detroit, Super attentive, kind, knowledgeable, and fun."}
{"text":"Don't look anymore. If you are looking for a sushi experience, this is the place. Please do not get stuck with the sushi menu. Check the rest of the food (the skewers are fantastic). Sat at the main bar or the sushi bar, it doesn't matter where you sit. You won't be disappointed with Ki. My recommendation? Stay away from Nigiri and try Sashimi. Really the best sushi in Toronto."}
{"text":"The decor is nice and modern. Indoor and outdoor patio options. Enjoyed their happy hour and it was available until 7pm. Food was DE-LISH! 

(Unfortunately, had to take off one star for the lipstick/lip gloss residue on the glass and we were told it was just orange juice residue -  we still requested for a cleaner glass and we were provided a new one. When bringing the new glass, the staff agreed that it was lipstick.) 

Don't let it discourage you - the food was good!!!"}
{"text":"Went for drinks and apps.  Service was excellent.  Attentive and patient.

Food was excellent.  Very tasty and good portions.  Had shrimp, peppers, tempura etc.  All well seasoned, had great dipping sauces and fresh."}
{"text":"Fancy Smancy.  Love the dark atmosphere and service.  Food portions were generous.  Dislike elevator music...."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday on a Friday night. First impression: It's a bit of a pretentious place. Walking in, I wasn't sure if I was at a banker conference or a sushi restaurant. It was pretty loud, and young men were at the bar in suits. They were playing some pretty sweet house music... Definitely going for a modern, fusion feel. Probably works well for the Bay Street crowd, but I enjoy smaller, more authentic sushi places.

Decor was trendy and modern. It was dimly lit, which I find really annoying, especially when combined with loud chatter. Again, I guess it's a Bay Street thing. Side note: Ladies, taking pictures in the bathroom is a must. The big orange couch, the full-length mirror, the wooden shutter doors... So many possibilities.

It was pretty busy, but we were a table of eight and had a waitress to ourselves, so our service was great. Our waitress - a tall woman with short red hair - was extremely helpful and patient with us. Most of us were used to grubby, cheap, all-you-can-eat sushi spots, so we had a lot of questions, but she really took her time answering each of them.

Drinks came first, and they were great. Though there was a lot to choose from, most of us went with raspberry cocktails or white wine. Next, the appetizers. I decided to experiment with the swordfish, and it was pretty good - tender and juicy, but could've used a bit more flavour. Finally, the main course... There were lots of unique fusion choices. Most of us chose authentic maki rolls, and they were delicious and tightly wrapped.

The service was great, and the food was good, but for some reason, I left the place wanting more. For the price I paid (double the amount I usually pay for sushi dinner), I'd expect an orgasmic eating experience, but Ki didn't take me there."}
{"text":"this place is really trendy and decorated nicely... the sushi is good but for the price you pay i'm sure you can buy better.. but as any diner you're going for the experience.. so it was nice."}
{"text":"Great place for Japanese fusion food, I had the miso chowder which was rich and delicious!!! The beef sashimi with garlic chips is a must have."}
{"text":"A must try! Fish is fresh and portions are quite generous. Location is convenient although finding a parking in the financial district can be a tad complicated. Great service and amazing menu. Great drinks, as well as fantastic atmosphere. I would suggest a reservation on weekends since it is quite hard to get a table otherwise."}
{"text":"Meh. That's a good way to describe this restaurant. LOL!! It is so expensive and not very good. Their rolls aren't that great, their skewers lack flavour, their sushi isn't that good either.

On the positive side, they have great service and lovely atmosphere! I'd come here for casual drinks and order some appetizers, but not regular Japanese food."}
{"text":"I recently dined here with a colleague for a business dinner on a beautiful and warm evening! It has been quite some time since I dined here, and in fact, I had been avoiding it due to concerns of a health scare at the restaurant a few years back.

Upon our arrival we were seated indoors; however, because the weather was so incredible, I asked for outdoor seating and was advised that there was an 'open seating' policy outdoors. Luckily, we were able to secure a table for two.

Our server was attentive and was able to provide excellent recommendations as to the menu. I had looked at the menu before coming to the restaurant and was disappointed that some of the drink and wine options were no longer available. Nevertheless, my colleague and I ordered a fantastic rose.

We shared the sashimi salad which was beautifully presented with an assortment of sashimi atop romaine lettuce, accompanied by cherry tomatoes ($13).

As my main dish, I had the diver scallops, of which there were 4 large scallops in total, accompanied by a light tomato based sauce. The scallops  were perfectly done and I wished for more! I do think that the price of $42 for 4 scallops was quite steep though.

My colleague had the hamachi jalapeno dish ($17) which she enjoyed, followed by a tempura roll which she found to be quite flavourful overall and not at all greasy or overdone ($18).

Overall, the ambience, the food, and the service was great! I've been here before and the menu, and overall experience has been the same. It would be nice to see that Ki is able to set itself apart from competitors going forward!"}
{"text":"Mediocre.  Service was just okay.  It took over an hour and a half, and we did not have drinks.  For a financial district restaurant you should be able to do a lunch in & out within an hour, especially considering we didn't order anything cooked (besides Tempura which takes like 5 minutes in the fryer). 

I think she sensed we would not be a big spending table as we did not order any cocktails.  Although the cocktail menu looked great, I think our service suffered because of it and the table next to us who was drinking, certainly got more attention and passes around by the waitress. 

The food is nothing special for the price, to be honest."}
{"text":"Overpriced, Japanese fusion. There's too many good Japanese restaurants in the core to settle for this."}
{"text":"Best fresh sashimi in the city! It is expensive and worth it but it's definitely a splurge. Favourite rolls are the spicy tuna and the spicy otoro maki."}
{"text":"If you are on a first date, and are ready to spend enough to impress, make a reservation and go here.
It's probably the best Japanese food you can get in Alberta! The chef clearly takes a lot of pride in what they do.
If you are a regular, you will get your own \"wine file\", they will keep track of your taste and will suggest exquisite selections to pair with your food the next time.

The food was excellent and the service deserves a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Brought in the new year here....awesome saki, great staff and good food..."}
{"text":"Been there once. A friend raved about how great this place was so had to go there and check it out myself. 

Overall: I don't think I'm cool enough for this place. They dropped some major cash on the looks...pardon me, \"ambiance\".  When I got their menu in my hand, I had a bit of a sticker shock. Alright, this sushi place is on Bay St, right? I guess it can't be cheap then. Maybe the food is going to be great?

Alas, not so. The portions are tiny. The taste is meh. But it sure looks great and \"progressive\".

Modern it sure is. Japanese? Not so much."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. It gets seriously packed after work most days and at lunch so if going during those times make sure to book a reservation. 

The ahi tuna burger served only at lunch is amazing. Definitely worth fighting the crowd of already drunken suits.

The rock shrimp is so delicious and you will see most tables order at least one helping. The butterfish roll is amazing. The spicy avocado is the best item. It is avocado, pineapple,  tomatoes,  and chives wrapped in cucumber. It is crunchy, spicy and sweet! Who could resist?"}
{"text":"Huge kudos to Ki.

I'm always a bit wary of trying Japanese food in Calgary, but Ki was actually really good. Great spot for a business lunch.

Definitely on the upscale side. Fantastic service and the food is quite delicious. We ordered a whole array of items from the menu:

1.  Miso soup - $6 for miso soup is quite steep but hey, if you're craving miso soup, it's hard to resist.

2.  Kiwi tuna - so good and refreshing. Order this.

3.  BC tuna + chives - this is pretty much a glorified tuna sushi roll. Avoid.

4.  Ki beef maki - this is probably the best dish that we had. 

5. Toro tower - looks more like a toro pile than a tower, but it was good

6. Mitsu - never had mitsu before.  I'm a fan.

So there you go.  +1 to Calgary for having a decent Japanese joint downtown."}
{"text":"Service was fabulous, extremely attentive waiter who wasn't over-bearing but could not have been more helpful.  It was a Monday night so spared any of the meat-market observations made in other reviews, but the atmosphere seemed very relaxed and friendly in quite a trendy setting.

Best grilled squid I've had in Toronto yet, moist and flavorsome went extremely well with the seaweed salad. Scrummy fresh fruit juice and cocktails, decent wine list also.  They didn't have ginger tea on the menu, so the waiter kindly made some up from fresh ginger in the kitchen.

Thought prices were high but reasonable given setting and quality of food and service - approx. $80 head for two courses with drinks.  Have already booked again."}
{"text":"Best ever. Green tea with brown rice was amazing. Sushi lunch special was excellent, butterfish roll with mango was perfect. Would recommend for client lunch or date. Service was prompt, professional and attentive."}
{"text":"Yum! Oh my this place is sooooo good. I love my lunch times here the sushi is just sooo delightful. I've been here for business lunches and I have to say that the atmosphere is very classy which makes it easy to bring clients to. The food is delicious and the service is fast which is great when you'll,y have an hour or so over the lunch hour. This place is a little pricy so if you are looking for frugal eats this is not your go to place. All in all though I really like this place and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Makes for a pricy dinner out but oh-so-amazing.. the stuff of dreams! I never thought I liked pork belly until I tried theirs, and I haven't stopped thinking about that pork belly since I first ate here 3 years ago.
The cocktail menu is a bit daunting since I'm not familiar with the types of liquor used in most of the drinks but it seems to all taste good all the same!
Also, random but true: great lattes at Ki!"}
{"text":"Attentive service and delicious food, can't ask for much more. My parents are notoriously hard to impress and they both loved our big taste dinner at Ki. Can't say enough good things about the service we received that night and all the courses we had were very enjoyable, albeit not the biggest portions. Have to single out the flat iron steak and the truffle chocolate cake and Yuku semi Fredo. Wonderfully balanced flavours and memorable."}
{"text":"Our server is not very good at his job and act worse after we ask manager to find our server to place order because we have been waiting for a while. The manager nicely send her apology and that was the only nice thing in that restaurant because the food was not good as well( I hope it's not because of our waiter) . to be fair, sushi is ok, but the soup  and the scallops are way too salty for any normal palate, so either the chief lost his palate or our waiter added more spices for us. we don't want to make a scene so we ate our overly salty food and left. I know I should complain which I didn't. So I hope if anyone have the same experience would speak up for themselves and don't be like me. It feels terrible to tip the waiter when he don't deserve it and say no thing just to be nice."}
{"text":"Great location for ACC, went here before showing up fashionably late at the Raptors game.

There are 3 areas really, a bar area, a sushi bar area, and a dining room area with booths. They look quite nice with big booths and candlelight. Agree that it looks like a great place to bring/impress a date for sushi.

Sushi came out very fast, and well presented...although one of my California rolls fell apart a bit. Still quite tasty in a mashed up, soy drowned mess. Butterfish tempura rolls were quite good too. I'm usually not that adventurous with sushi, but happy i branched out. Spicy tuna was standard.

Service was attentive and fast, didnt get in the way and was quick to notice asking for more sushi, or more wine, the bill, etc.
Bit expensive overall, but that financial district dining for you...would go here again before the ACC."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 10 times.  The place is beautiful and tables are well spaced out. I absolutely love the horse hair and other unique artwork throughout the restaurant!!! 

Service is usually very good although not prompt. For lunch, this is not a get in and out in under an hour type of establishment. Wait staff are fairly knowledgable about the menu but can be disorganized. 

Food selection is excellent!  I love the black cod. Portions are not as large as you may expect and sushi and sashimi are truly bite size pieces. The price range is 1.5 to double what you'd pay in many other places due to location and decor. Sushi is not outstanding in my opinion. I've enjoyed their hot items such as bento boxes, steak, scallops and miso soup. 

I've eaten in the lounge, the dining room and the patio. The patio can be loud but that's to be expected as it's beside the Westin Hotel. Overall, this is a good business lunch place and serves the    Bill (haha, no pun intended) quite well. Definitely worth a try for a special occasion"}
{"text":"My girls and I were in the area on Friday night, not knowing where to go for dinner without having to go too far. We finally decided to try Ki (we were walking by it). We've always seen this place from outside and always wondered what it would be like. The appearance, decor, and atmosphere of the place is nice; both exterior and interior. The place is divided into dining and lounge section, as well as the sushi bar area.

We asked the waitress for recommendation and we ended up ordering striploin cubes, 3 pieces of salmon sashimi, black cod, kiwi-tuna roll, and butter tempura roll.  They don't serve complimentary green tea, and salad like some of the Japanese restaurants we have been to. After waiting about 15-20 minutes and wondering where our dishes were, our dishes finally came out; but all together! Two very nicely dressed male waiters placed all of our orders very carefully on the table. Each dish was nicely presented and we took our time taking pictures of each dish!

Every dish was delicious. Black cod and salmon sashimi must melts in your mouths, striploin was very tender and just cooked perfectly. We all loved the kiwi-tuna roll.

Service was good, nothing outstanding.
Quality of food was memorable, but price is bit on the high end.

Not an everyday restaurant but recommend it for special occasion. However, probably not the top three sushi place I would visit in Toronto, but maybe top six.."}
{"text":"Went last Thursday after work.  The bar was really crowded and trendy.  Even though the bar was 3 deep, I was able to get close enough for the bartender to see me.  Good eyes!  Martini was good, albeit not quite cold enough.  I was concerned the restaurant would be too loud and chaotic.  My friend walked in and we were seated very quickly (we had reservations).  The hostess walked us to another part of the restaurant that was quite and relaxing.  Ingrid was our server and she was amazing.  Our food was excellent, the service impeccable (not just Ingrid, but all the wait staff). Excellent sushi, service and ambiance. It's not cheap, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Come here if u have money to burn & enjoy a beautiful looking restaurant. The prices are just ridiculous! The atmosphere and decor was very nice and mod. Service I guess excellent though they kept asking us if we wanted drinks. 

The food imho had wonderful presentation. However the taste was just average. I felt like I could find something better elsewhere uptown for less. 

My hubby and I had ... 1 cocktail, 1 beer, spicy salmon (6 rolls - nothing special...better at AYCE), scallops (there were only 4 pieces and it was $25. taste for the scallops was just average but the sauce was nice. honestly i felt like i could make this myself), halibut (a bit dry). Let's just say by the end of the meal we were still hungry and ended up going to mcdonalds after. The bill came out to $110.We were there for a birthday dinner (about 16 of us). I know gratuity is included for large groups but did not expect it to be 18%. 

The wait staff were nice and very accommodating. A friend had soya sauce on their white jacket (not sure how it got there) and the restaurant paid or offered dry cleaning. Well with the 18% S/C I guess u gota bend over backwards?

We brought over a bday cake and were allowed to have it served at the restaurant. I think I was more full from my own cake than the food at Ki.... 

Perfect place for yuppies & gold diggers"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends for New Year's eve, and things were great. Large lounge area where you wait to have your table setup (or where they pre-sell you on drinks), ample seating, different kitchens doing parts of the menu and and extensive wine menu. Staff was friendly and attentive though they were about 20 min late in having a table ready for our reservation. This place is pretty much for trendy rich people with more money than sense, since the menu here can't really justify such high prices in terms of flavor or portions.

We ended up waiting an additional 40 min for 2/3 of our party to be served with starters and entrees which was an issue since we had other plans after for the new year celebration. The place was half empty so clearly there was no serious backlog for either of the kitchens to handle. Aside from that, it was an alright experience no major issues here, just a lot of small things."}
{"text":"Love this place. 
I had first been invited to the opening of this restaurant and haven't gone back to many times since, but wish i visited more.
It's Japanese fusion cuisine done really well. Fresh foods, clean flavours, and different from just regular japanese food. 
I went again last week and had some excellent things. The sashimi salad was amazing. the kiwi tuna is fresh and different. the short ribs were rich and delicious. the trio of creme brule has always been my top choice for dessert there. 

All in all, Ki is a high end japanese fusion restaurant. You can expect to drop some coin, but you can expect to also try some flavours you probably haven't yet. I also think it's worth noting that there wine list is actually quite good and decently priced. I was drinking 9 oz pours of berringer for only $16

The bar is also really cool so it makes a nice after work spot. Infact the bar is the central focus of the entire restaurant. 


What most ppl don't know about this place:
Most of the staff at Ki are all from the Keg. A famous restaurateur who worked for the keg 'Hoss' (passed away a few years ago) opened Ki with backing from the owner of the Keg. He took most of the staff and management from the Keg to keep the same level of friendly service,  and hired a new chef to design the menu. Same guy also opened up Brasai"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and mix of classic and fusion sushi, but the place is too pricey."}
{"text":"I generally don't like writing bad reviews but I was very disappointed today and have to share this! Starting off with the service- I give 0 stars. My gf and I walked in and the girl at the front was on her phone giggling without saying hi or welcoming us. We were seated outside and our server just didn't bother making an effort asking if we needed anything and I had to ask another server to ask her to bring us the bill. Also, there were two girls standing by the door when we were walking out and they did not say bye back! Food: 4 for presentation and 0.5 for the taste. The crab in the spider roll was burnt and not edible. The chowder looked amazing but the taste was nothing like chowder. More like seaweed soup with a weird after taste. I've had better spicy tuna roll from the sushi place inside Sobeys... My overall experience was terrible. This was a lunch I hope I can soon forget!"}
{"text":"Over priced average sashimi + annoying waitress that comes over every 5 mins to ask if i want to order anything else makes for a crappy experience. Starting to understand why this place is 5% full at peak dinner time."}
{"text":"Pretty good and fresh sushi. Service was excellent. A tad over priced because of the location. This restaurant is more geared towards customers with company expense accounts. Atmosphere is great for special occasions or romantic dinners."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Westin a couple blocks away and they recommended Ki. We arrived late Halloween day, and tried to get a reservation on our own, but could not get one till 9:30pm. We called the concierge at the hotel and they were able to get us a reservation at 8:15pm. 
We had a wonderful, relaxing, and perfectly paced dinner at Ki even on a big night like Halloween thanks to our perfectly attentive waiter Jacob. Service was spot on at Ki. We loved the dimly candle lit place with over-sized booths and minimal decorations. 
We took our time and tried tons of things. For appetizers we had the seafood salad and a side of spicy edamame. The seafood salad was a nice mix with a very light and pleasant dressing. The added spice to the edamame was a nice twist. Afterwards, we had an order of the Hamachi with jalapenos. The Hamachi was DELISH, but we wished the jalapenos hadn't been so hollowed out as there was no kick or spice left. We also had an order of their Toro, which we found to be delicious but definitely not the best we ever had. At $17 for just 3 pieces of sashimi, we were expecting a lot more. For hot entrees, we had the braised cod which was impeccable, light, fluffy, and melted in your mouth. We also had an order of the scallops which were absolutely huge, tender, and cooked just right. 
For dessert we had their flour-less chocolate cake. For some reason I was expecting something light, warm, and gooey. The cake was not any of those. It was cold, dense, and extremely rich. It was good, but again not what I expected or was in the mood for. 
Ki was a nice find and we genuinely enjoyed our experience. Their cocktails are to die for! My husband drank at least 4 of something that had a spray of lagavoulin in it. Needless to say, we left Ki very full, content, and a bit tipsy."}
{"text":"service is good if you look like you have money.  

japanese food connoisseurs would be wise to go elsewhere.  a place more to be seen than a place to eat."}
{"text":"Had a after work drink at KI yesterday after Walrus across the street couldn't acv9midate our group.

The staff were wonderful and accommodated our group and added 3 chairs and two tables without any issues. Very nice gentleman at the door was  happy to accommodate us and the waitresses were extremely attentive and Leo our cups n bellys full! 

It wasn't super crowded probably because it was earlier but great ambience and the patio is a beauty but in March you cant be on no patio in Toronto!! I had the whisky cocktail which was STRONG but hey I got my 10 bucks worth and the Sapporo was only 5!

Beautiful place yummy apps and great drinks!! As a first I have no pics but I was too lost in the conversation :)"}
{"text":"Downtown Core is not exactly a Toronto foodie's first pick of neighborhoods to find good eats.  But the demands of work often cause you to find the easiest and most accessible dinner option, and Ki certainly distinguishes itself with its location, modern look and feel, and friendly service.

Ki has both a hot kitchen and a sushi bar.  The menu caters to a range of tastes and preferences.  The edamame with seven spices and the sweet potato are remarkably good.  The vegetable tempura and the tofu dishes round out the vegetarian subset of the menu.

Ask for the free truffles on your way out.  And leave a generous tip.  After all, you are paying for great service combined with the high rents on Bay Street and Brookfield Place."}
{"text":"Every time I've been here it has been nothing but an excellent dining experience. It definitely is pricey but the staff are incredible and the food is absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"In honour of my ongoing Chihuly hunt (my best friend and I decided to find all Chihuly art pieces in Toronto), I unfortunately decided to pay Ki a visit. 

Ki's decor is superb. I will give you that. It's side entrance adorned by a massive Chihuly piece. However, as soon as I walked in, I was getting nervous that I was making the wrong choice. 

A good description of Ki is \"fusion gone rogue\". Also, last time I checked when was it hipster to charge me $7 dollars for white rice?

I got tofu steak, which put nicely, \"tasted peculiar\". The seasoning was way off, and my palette felt like it was having an identity crisis. 
The sushi was not that fresh and if you blindfolded me and made me taste $10 all-you-can-eat sushi v. this $30 dollar plate, to be honest I wouldn't know the difference."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times now. I'm feeling like I need to be honest and say that I have mixed emotions. 

The food has always been good bordering on really tasty - sometimes there are misses. Cocktails are ok and not out of this world expensive. 

I'm surprised that it's such a lunch place, but Calgary really has no big city vibe.....

I don't eat meat, so all I can tell you is that anything on the menu that isn't meat, is good. I think it's also a great place to bring people who are not quite comfortable trying new foods or anything ethnic. Good break in spot. 

Good location and clean place, nice style......that's about it. 

Not over the moon with it, but as far as Calgary goes, it's a good spot. 

The patio is ok in the summer too!"}
{"text":"Located inside the gorgeously vault ceilinged Brookfield Place, Ki is Bay street's swishy take on nouveau Japanese cuisine.

Thankfully I came here for dinner with friends and not for the brutal financial district cruise scene, which was in full swing and packed to the gills on a Thursday night. 
The decor inside this cavernous resto/bar is modern with luxuriant tones and textures of Asian inspired elegance.  I loved the aesthetic novelty of the stone paved moat that bordered the upper dining area where we were seated.  Just a word of caution to be weary you don't drop your YSL bag into the water as there is no physical border between the seat and the moat. The bathroom is also lovely, with it's own lush red suede upholstered couch perfect for sitting stylishly cross-legged while you wait your turn to go.

My lovely dining companions and I order the seasonal vegetable tempura, the saikyo-marinated and broiled Black Cod with rapini, salmon roe and orange reduction and a trifecta of makimonos spicy tuna, spider roll and the dynamite rolls.
Ki serves best tempura I've had, hands down in T.O., no sogginess no greasiness just the right amount of light crispness all the while retaining the flavour and texture of whatever exotic veggie has been given the tempura treatment. The black cod is absolutely sublime as its fleshy melt in your mouth texture, melds perfectly with the flavourful briny-ness of the salmon roe. Portions of the food here is on the smallish side but still pack a powerhouse of flavour and are filling regardless of their lilliputian servings.

Ki has the potential to be a romantic, sexy dining spot, what with all the candle light and sensual red hued decor. For a date however I'd suggest to steer away from a view of the bar where observing the pitiful mating rituals between the Bay street suits with receeding (or hairplugged) hairlines and the been around the block for the umpteenth time singleton gals who take their fashion cues from the \"Housewives of Atlanta\" will guarantee a loss of both appetite and libido. Service wise Ki is stoically efficient at best almost robotically congenial as I felt our server had the emotional depth of a replicant.

Dessert was a welcome finale to our meal as the sumptuous dessert of flourless Grand Marnier Chocolate Truffle Cake was like smokin' sex on a plate, and probably would deliver more release than anyone you could hope to pick up at the bar here..heyo!  The almond pear with coconut creme anglais (swoon) was also pretty kick ass too!

Ki is pricy (our meal came to about $85, before drinks taxes and tips), being that it is a Bay street \"scenester\" hangout I suppose that it's par for the course.  The food and surroundings are gorgeous and what's more you may even find some comic relief by the laugable display of people watching.  If you want a taste of haute modern Japanese food, and can look past the pretension and pricing, Ki is an indulgent and savory escape from the usual Asian dining experience."}
{"text":"I am not much into sushi/Japanese cuisine but this restaurant by far was the best. Ambience n decor is lavish and posh. Place is huge and could easily accommodate 100 people. Location is perfect as it's well connected to path. Best sushi I tried till date and house made ginger ale goes perfect with it. There speciality cucumber n Avocado one is the best and gives refreshing taste. Every dish you order looks amazing and has its own signature taste. Expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"What a cute restaurant! Both interior and exterior is amazing! Inside is dark, very great ambiance if you're going on a date! 

Service is super friendly and fast and sushi is amazing!!!!! Fish is so fresh and literally melts in your mouth. Their edamame is amazing too!! Not salty or over cooked like most restaurants prepare and it has a kick with chilli flakes!"}
{"text":"I know this place specializes in raw fish and could technically be called a fish market of sorts but really... this place is a true MEAT market.  Bay St. boys pile in here after work and the amount of leg, skin, and other womanly body parts just astounds me.  I'm sure I've seen more skin here than an European beach resort (unfortunate sightings of speedos... :( ).  The food is trendy and fusion.  There's nothing traditional here!  This place is all about drama... dim lighting and bold red tones are everywhere.  

The food is a mish mash of Japanese and modern food pairings.  I would say that they do take care of the details so you're never given poorly cut fish or mushy shari (sushi rice).  I just find the taste not the optimal.  We tried a maki roll with yellowfin tuna, mango, cucumber, spicy tomato salsa, kiwi pieces and it had a miso sauce on top.  I will say that this did not taste good.. the sweet and savoury was not combining well.  The acidity of the tomato did not get balance by the mango.  It's possible that the mango was not fully ripe either as it had a more sour note to it.  That sour note was enhanced by the kiwi pieces... not pleasant.  Another poor maki flavouring was the futomaki.  I have no idea who ordered this for the table but I wanted to smack them.  The menu read \"goji berry, spinach, braised shiitake, cucumber + Pretz sticks\".  Dear lawd... really?  The spinach was possibly too old and left a bitter rough texture on the tongue.  Shiitake mushrooms had great umami but it was possibly too strong for the maki roll.  I did like the pretzel sticks for the crunch factor (even though it's really unconventional).

We also got the skewers of pork belly and chicken.  The pork belly was the better of the two as it had lots of nice flavours and it was tender (thanks to the fatty pieces).  The teriyaki sauce was strong but not overly sweet and cloying.  The chicken was a touch dry but teriyaki sauced saved it from being a desert.  The supposed leeks made no appearance (flavour or visually).  

We got more dishes but I won't bore you with the details.  Suffice to say, it was an expensive meal and I would say the quality is ok.  Service is competent but really pushes hard on the liquor.  If anything, service was barely a blip because the amusing bar scene took centre stage.  There are definitely better and more affordable options for Japanese food in downtown TO.  But I will say that Ki is not so much about food but for the meat market and bar scene.

The bar has many special Asian fusion drinks.  I'm not a drinker but even they have some tempting sounding cocktails. A lychee plum wine cocktail?  Nice!  The bar evironment is where all the action happens and if you want to be amused, come here on Thursday or Friday and watch the Bay St. boys try to pick up the Christina Aguiliera look alikes here."}
{"text":"After the mall my bf & me were craving sushi before our late night double date dinner. We decided to go to Ki since I am a fan of the one in Toronto. It was my bf first time. We sat in the lounge and ordered wine and mixed drinks. I ordered the seaweed salad with assorted greens + sesame-ponzu dressing $9 which I usually get when I go there. Very yummy and large portion, I took it back to the hotel with me. We split the tossed edamame with seven spice $6 which is quite a big portion for edamame - yummy as well! My bf got the dynamite roll tempura shrimp, mayo, tobiko + cucumber $10 (6 pieces per maki order) and a few pieces of sashimi. He said it was really fresh and yummy! They also sent us 2 complimentary pieces which my bf had since I don't eat fish. He said they were tasty too! Very upscale sushi place and the lounge is great to relax and drink. Always guaranteed a good time @ Ki~"}
{"text":"The food was generally ok (not incredible), the place was clean, and the atmosphere was nice, which is why I gave it 2 stars.  My friend and I went for a late dinner, so it wasn't extremely busy.  What stood out to me was the bad service - we were seated across the aisle from a loud table of 4, whose conversation was dominated by a short, self-important dentist and his dim-witted blonde friend who thought she was much more pretty and interesting than she actually was.  I frankly could have ignored the table, except they took all the attention from our server and we had to ask other servers for help with getting ONE refill of water and the bill.  At one point, a different person cleared our table and had her arm grabbed by a different server (still not the original one), as if she were doing something wrong - as they spoke in French, I'm not quite sure what the issue was, as it seemed she was just helping out.  In a place this size, a server should be trained to handle multiple tables, including a table that demands more attention, without giving other tables the shaft - or, at least have enough servers to cover the shift.  I tip well for good service and exceedingly well for exceedingly good service, and was prepared to dump my excess Canadian dollars there (I'd exchanged too much for this trip, and I'm betting my amount would have matched if not exceeded the other table's tip), but since it wasn't even a good experience, I had no problem leaving ZILCH for bad service.  However, my friend felt guilty leaving nothing so the server still got tipped for ignoring us, which is more than he deserved."}
{"text":"Decor was nice, light traffic on a Friday night, they played good music and food was pretty good. It's a nice place to have conversation.

Not worth the price though, no one at our table would probably return but we had a comfortable dinner. 

Sushi portions were small, not everyone enjoyed the taste, alcoholic drinks were sweet and strong. 

We ordered two desserts, neither of them were outstanding. The mini matcha donuts tasted stale, total waste of calories and overpriced at that. They came with too much sauce but at least the sauce was good. 

Lots of staff. Probably more staff than customers on a Friday night."}
{"text":"This place was good... I liked the ambience and the sushi was not bad... It is not my favorite sushi place in Calgary, but I would go back..."}
{"text":"As the only sit-down restaurant for sushi in the financial district, this is a go-to place for people in my office. There's really nothing bad to say about this place. It's reliable, fancy, and all of that. If you're willing to explore outside of the financial district, there will be other places of better value- but for what it's catered to be, which is to the business crowd- Ki is great. Take your clients here, take your team here- they will enjoy it for sure. The patio, despite being surrounded by concrete bricks, is fairly comfy because of how they've decorated the space. They have heaters for the chilly weather, although they usually close the patio after thanksgiving- so you'll have to wait until next season again."}
{"text":"I went to Ki the other night with several co-workers while on business in Calgary (where I've been spending a lot of time lately). While there were some positive aspects of the restaurant, I left hungry and very disappointed.

Let's start with the positives...

The staff were very friendly and attentive. It made the restaurant feel inviting, even though it was relatively empty on this Tuesday evening. This is something a lot of restaurants get wrong, so I was happy to see it.

The interior was striking. High ceilings and a very modern look. I have to admit it didn't quite feel as \"modern Japanese\" as the restaurant strives to be and was a bit oddly segmented (and thus didn't seem to be buzzing). But it was clean and impactful. No complaints.

Unfortunately, once I took a glance at the menu things started to go awry. It's spendy. I mean, *really* spendy. Maybe it's really high quality, though? Sadly, not true.

What did I eat?

I started with the assorted seaweed salad. I wanted something fresh, light and healthy to start. It was a surprisingly large portion for a starter, though it was probably meant to share. It was almost like they had done something to take the flavor of the seaweed and was surprisingly chewy. Even the dressing, which provided some flavor, did not do enough to salvage the dish.

I also started with a miso soup. This dish baffled me. It was so salty. So salty you couldn't even taste the usual layers of flavor in a good miso soup. The best way to describe it? Imagine going to the ocean. Go ahead. I'll wait. Now put some of that delicious ocean water in a bowl. And heat it up. Yeah, isn't that tasty?

Next up was some toro sashimi. The portion size was very tiny. Really thin cuts. Honestly, it didn't taste very fresh. It was oddly stiff, yet slimy -- which made me wonder if it was frozen. I don't think it was, but I think it just wasn't good-quality toro. For the price, disgraceful. I get toro 3 times as good for half the price in Vancouver.

My co-workers had an assortment of rolls, which I sampled a bit of. They were a mishmash of flavors that didn't entirely work, and the fish in them suffered from the same issues as my toro. I will note, however, that while they did not enjoy their meals, they liked things a bit better than I did.

To finish, I had the hot plate of scallops. This was the best of the dishes I had. The scallops were pretty well-cooked, but the seasoning wasn't quite right and they put some other flavors on the plate that really overpowered the scallop. When you have good scallops, don't mask them!

I never like giving a one star review or a five star review. You have to really earn each of those ratings. When I'm having trouble deciding on what to rate a restaurant, I always fall back on Yelp's helpful guide. A two star rating is \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" That's definitely true for Ki. And it would get a two star rating if it weren't for the price.

With the price? \"Eek! Methinks not.\" One star."}
{"text":"I initially wanted to do 3Stars but decided to do 1 n will explain why . 

Took me 4 calls over 40 min to make reservation between 3:40-4:20pm , phone kept ringing but no one was answering. Lol . Odd  

Waitress came to order , we were not(but almost) ready . She took off n didn't come back for at least 20 min we were waiting for long time staring at each other  . 

food was not good . scallops skeeters were under cooked , the Center was raw , pink n rubbery . Chicken  drumlettes  were extremely over Cooked! I had NEvER had more chewey chicken than those . The meat was so Tough!  there was absolutely no moisture at all. Becusse it had sugary BBQ sauce on top that was also dried out made the texture even more tough one step close to unpalatable  . The short ribs were extremely tough ! Completely DRY dense n chewy !!! The sushi n sashimi were delicious!! This is the only place I know makes stake shushi ! My bf who doesn't et seafood was able to destroy the steel rolls n yam rolls fast! 

The Unagi sashimi was so delicious ! The unagi meat was juicy  n satisfying . But 4 small piece costs about $47(aft tax in n the tip) U can judge if it's worth it. 

$8 tinny Garlic fried rice was --- dry n chewy! Japanese fried rice is well known for being fluffy n soft n semi sticky . These rice present consistency of hard plastic balls that is Being sitting out in rice cooker all day that the moisture is completely drawn out ! Or the rice is overly dry fried in the pan when oil is too hot! When the rice  reached my tongue , my tongue detected the unpleasant hard texture like u detect sand in the mouth! The short ribs were extremely chewy as well beyond well done! I was shocked how tough it was . I shifted the chicken drummers, rice , tough riMy gf tried the cod n fish egg on top. Yelled out \"YUK! Why it tasted so Fishy!!!\" Fallowing that , tried it myself Black cod was delirious but please avoid the fish roe(little fish eggs) on top, they r the fishiest n GROSSEST  things I have tried my whole life n leave extreme awful taste in your mouth aft one tinny ball ! (I am Chinese I can eat very fishy stuff , I almost vomit . Not exaggerating! I grabbed my bf's beer so fast to wash my mouth ) !  When the egg pops in your mouth the most foul smelly bitter liquid explodes n cakes your entire mouth , tongue n throat  u can't even react fast enough to reverse it! The fish eggs Tasted like seafood gone bad like badly decomposed! I suspect those fish eggs r not fresh left over thru the weekend . I might had bad luck on Monday. I love fish eggs n crab juices usually. Right now I am writing this I find myself stomach turning n i am semi gagging . 

service is so So , the waitress came couple of times to refill water . However her face was frozen . Quite contrast from the wait staff we had at Sassafraz 4 days ago . Our waitress had the Kanye sweat style (RBF) face  :-  her voice was not so pleasant . The booth seats were very low , she stood up high n distant n pretty much Stoney faced , Stoney voiced n the whole time. I rather serve myself if u could . 

Over all I think the sushi n sashimi  have the best taste, alone with the Vege n tiger shrimp tempuras . ANYTHING grilled or fried was ABSOLUTELY fail! Either severely under cooked or completely over cooked. The decore was dark n we sat at the corner of an elevated area at a corner . So the whole time we n were sitting facing 3 sides of High wall. Not very inviting place to go to like MIKU or Sassa Fraz with open tables n high ceiling Make sure ask not to seat u at the elevated area that the 4-5 booths r connected in the shape of a C . We sat at end of C facing inward close to the ceiling lol(it's walled off I don't see anything but ppl at my table, like u sit at the end of office end cubical eating facing Wall n it's DARK )  --- talking about paying good money for good atmosphere. def NOT there !!! We had another bad luck our seating was awkwardly positioned in a place shouldn't be having any seating so the seating was uncomfortable n VERY small completely disconnected from rest restaurant. 

My best friend who frequents MIKU by her condo was severely under whelmed by the decore, service , food of Ki since I was getting her hyped up about this place . Most of all I feel bad for dragging them with me . Aft all the waitress still received  to $45 for her service regardless of dissatisfaction . So I am not just writing an empty bad review . I wish  restaurants do not send waitresses  that r bitchy (looking, voice, attitude ) .\" perception is the truth\" says Dr. Phill.  End of no gI saw her lips were injected cosmetically n very  , absolutely nothing wrong with that . Maybe it explained   her lack of smile n Stoney cold voice due to  frozen restrict  lip muscles !

I suspect they don't have good chefs on Mondays . Maybe just backup juniline cooks.  I will for sure get indigestion from meal there last night ."}
{"text":"Extremely fancy Japanese food.  As such, the quality is very high, but the portion size is extremely low.  I have been here a few times for work functions, and I always leave feeling hungry despite putting down close to 100 dollars per person.  The waitors/waitresses have terrific etiquette and know how to pour wine properly, and carry themselves very well.  It is a great place to take a date or host a business event, but I would never go here for any other reason.  It is just too expensive and portion sizes too small to leave feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"4 stars for Ki's pork belly appetizer."}
{"text":"I went back to Ki recently, and I've now upgraded my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  We got a tasting menu and it was outstanding.  There was truly nothing bad on the list, and the service was also outstanding.  Ki is now one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Overall a good experience. I think the staff could use a bit more education on the food itself as they were unable to answer some of my questions regarding the dishes (ingredients specifically), but the food itself was excellent. Definitely on the pricier side, but if you are willing to pay a bit more for your food, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Trendy, upscale vibe without being pretentious. 

The food was pretty good and plated well. Totally picture worthy. Food menu is a la carte and designed to be shared so portion sizes are on the smaller size. They did have some afternoon specials (any day after 4pm) ranging from $8-10 per order. My boyfriend and I split 3 items... I can honestly say I didn't leave feeling hungry but I definitely wasn't full either. Pricing was on the more expensive side given the quantity of food. 

Cocktails were around $14. I ordered a matcha drink which was delicious. Would highly recommend! 

Service was impeccable; our server was knowledgeable, friendly, attentive, and patient. She exemplified what it means to deliver great customer service. The waitstaff was equally as helpful, quickly delivering and clearing plates as we finished. 

I'd say you get what you pay for. You're paying more for the experience. Totally worth it in my book. 3.5 stars rounded up to 4."}
{"text":"Confused. From the menu to the food! Food taste bland. But, our server, Mathew is very helpful, he guide us thru some hot spot to check out as we are out of towners.
So ... One for the ambience and one for Mathew  ^^/"}
{"text":"Expensive for what you get. Went for a dinner with friends.

Service
Fairly good, for a busy Thursday night.

Atmosphere
Excessively loud, the bar was basically spilling everywhere.
The first thing the waitress said was \"I've gone deaf from working here, feel free to scream your order at me\"

Food
Ordered Ki Spider ($15) and a Binnaga ($11)

Ki Spider was just a spider roll with cold asparagus, not innovative or a particularly good pairing.

Binnga 
\"maple tamari\" means doused in soy sauce
\"wasabi crème fraiche\" is just not roll solid wasabi piped onto your plate. 

Best dish on the menu was the seaweed salad my friend got.

Take your money elsewhere, this was not Japanese."}
{"text":"Went to Ki for dinner during the week and must say it's one of the best sushi restaurants I've found in Toronto. 

Great atmosphere, amazing food, good service. The prices are higher than what you'll find at most other sushi places in Toronto, but if you're looking for a nicer place Ki is definitely a place you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I want to give four stars because I thought the food was actually quite good, but a couple of things prevent me from doing so.

Firstly, the prices are insane. I ordered a California roll and a lobster roll. 12 pieces of sushi, fairly standard-sized as far as sushi rolls go. My bill was for nearly $40. I anticipated this, of course, since I'd seen the prices on the menu, but still. I get that lobster and crab are generally more expensive ingredients, but for the amount (not much) that was actually in the roll, for the life of me I can't fathom how a six-piece sushi roll could cost $20.

That being said, the lobster roll was delicious. Definitely not authentic Japanese food, but I guess this is more of a modern/fusion place. It had a thin egg wrapper, which was interesting, as well as sliced mango inside, which I thought was a nice touch.

The California roll was decent - I enjoyed it, but I've had equally good ones at other restaurants for half the price. For at least two of the six pieces, I also ended up with crab shell in my mouth... not good. It's nice that they use actual crab as opposed to surimi/imitation crab (though for the price, they'd better be), but bones/shells where they shouldn't be is always an appetite-killer for me.

The last thing that I found kind of awkward was that when I paid for my meal (it came out to around $38.50, and I paid $40.50), the bartender didn't give me any change back. When I asked her about it, she apologized and said that she thought the extra $2 was left as a tip. While she was very nice about returning it, I just found it strange that she assumed it was a tip - at least in my experience, when the diner is paying in cash, it's customary for the server to ask if s/he wants change, and if so, how much. To top it off, I wasn't even dining in - I'd sat at the bar for a grand total of 5-10 minutes, so I'm not sure why she anticipated a tip anyway. (Who tips for take out orders?? You're not getting any service, so why would you?)

Anyway, overall I'd say that if you feel like eating good food in portion sizes that are not commensurate with the amount that you're spending, check out Ki and go wild."}
{"text":"For that price, the quality is so so. I have tried better in HK and Vancouver. The markup goes to the decoration. If you want to take a peek at it....go in to use the washroom and out. no need to spend $$$$ for some rice and raw fish."}
{"text":"Im just leaving the restaurant and Im very dissappointed. 

The place is nice but about the menu all I can say its pretencious, expensive and the sushi menú is very poor 

The service kind but slow"}
{"text":"Had the daily box for lunch with a couple of friends. The fish was one of the best I've ever had; that being said, I rarely ever have Butterfish sushi, but I fell in love that day. 

The portion was perfect, and the meal was amazingly satisfying - my friend had the lamb and that looked amazing too. I will definitely be coming back

What really impressed me was the service - our waitress was so nice and smiley! It just set the vibe and made the entire experience better. I forget her name, but she was a dark haired girl at the bar who told me her favourite is also the Butterfish!

{"text":"Good ambiance, service pretty good, unique japanese food but i still think it's too expensive for what it was. good/fun drinks!"}
{"text":"Loved the valet when you pull up to main doors. Friendly greeter.  
They were able to give us a private room for 15 ( adults n kids) on a sat night at 7.30pm. Server , Ria was well versed on the menu and wines.  We had usual favorites. Yakatori sticks of chicken, shrimp, scallops, pork belly and beef.  Dragon sushi rolls and stuffed cucumber were yummy n refreshing. 
Shrimp n vegetable tempura were light n crispy to perfection.  Wine pairing was a Mission Hill merlot.  Very nice. 
Kids loved the popcorn shrimp. Garlic rice was okay. 
Service from Ria was great, attentive and friendly.  Thank you.   End of meal  we were given pieces of dark chocolate.  Another nice touch. We spent  $642 tip included."}
{"text":"Delicious eats and a fun after work crowd.  It's a little pricey for a regular visit, but it's definitely perfect sporadically or for a special occasion!  If you're going with a group make sure to make a reservation, it's a busy place during happy hour."}
{"text":"My boyfriend really enjoyed his sushi and sashimi lunch special. I got the beef skewers and garlic fried rice. It was alright. I thought that mine was pretty overpriced. It was $19 for 6 small cubes of beef and 6 cherry tomatoes. However, the service was great. They give you hot towels to clean your hands with in the beginning and chocolates at the end."}
{"text":"Ki has easily become my favourite Japanese restaurant! 
We came in on a Friday night for our 8:00pm reservation. We were then graciously escorted to our table located towards the back of the restaurant. It was a very large and comfy booth beside a stone river that runs through the length of the restaurant. The end of the table was adorned with three large candles. It really made for a zen yet intimate atmosphere.

Our waiter was fabulous that evening. Very attentive, funny, and knowledgeable of the menu. He went over the whole menu with us making recommendations for each category. 

For drinks my husband was unsure about what type of sake to order. Again our wonderful waiter explained the differences and helped make recommendations. He even offered to bring a different type if he didn't like it. In the end he decided to go with the premium chilled sake on draught which he ended up loving. Heads up... its very strong! He could finish the last sip or else I would have had to carry him out. 
I ordered the Genmaicha green tea which is definitely the best green tea I've ever had! My husband who is not a fan of green tea even loved it and declared it his favourite tea. A server was even kind enough to find out and tell us where it comes from.

On to the food now! 

Tossed Edamame w/ Seven Spice
Hugeee portion came out piping hot, the spices added a wonderful shot of flavour to the ordinary edamame - very addictive

Tempura - Assorted seasonal vegetable
First of all this was the crispiest and least oily tempura I ever had. The vegetables we got were broccoli, green beans, sweet potato, and beets
Never had tempura beets before but I absolutely loved them! It's a must try! The tempura also came with two dips: a classic tempura + ki creamy roasted garlic dip 
I prefer the classic as I found the garlic dip masks the tastes of the veg

Spicy Salmon Roll - Atlantic salmon, asparagus, endive, spicy raspberry sauce
The spicy raspberry sauce really made this dish! It was more like a sweet and spicy hot sauce which gave the roll a nice boost of heat!

Ki Beef Maki - teriyaki glazed Canadian AAA striploin, sweet potato tempura, asparagus
One of the best rolls I ever had! The meat was very tender with a hint of sweetness from the glaze, loved added crunch from sweet potato tempura and asparagus 

Grilled Canadian AAA Tenderloin - served with a garlic ponzu sauce
Perfectly medium rare and soo tender absolutely loved this steak. The ponzu sauce was very addictive, I dipped every succulent piece of meat in it

Garlic Fried Rice 
Made with sticky white rice which made for easier eating with chop sticks, I loved the fried garlic chips sprinkled throughout the rice, definitely packed with garlic flavour

Flourless Chocolate Truffle Cake served with orange whiskey sauce
A very rich semi-sweet chocolate flavour, the texture of the cake was very dense and thick not too creamy, definitely fit for a chocolate lover. Didn't care for the whiskey sauce, there was just a bit of it smeared on the plate which I found just very sticky.

Trio of Ice Cream 
Sesame - I didn't really care for this flavour, found it too strong and intense like a really deep roasted sesame taste
Green Tea - nice strong matcha flavour, not too sweet
Red Bean - my favourite of the 3, tasted like vanilla ice cream with chewy bits of the sweet red bean

The whole meal was phenomenal from start to finish. Every course was beautifully presented, delicious, and flavourful. Everything came out in perfect timing and water always refilled, dishes cleared, cutlery reset, napkins even refolded for us! The service is first class and among the best we have ever encountered, they even gave us complimentary chocolates with our bill. Ki has rightfully become my favourite Japanese restaurant in Toronto! Quality, fresh, authentic food you must give it a try next time your in the mood for some Japanese!"}
{"text":"Three stars based on slow service - sushi was excellent.  I suggest not to dine at the sushi bar alone.  I arrived, found the chairs extremely difficult to work with; 10 minutes after I ordered my sushi, a couple came in and sat behind me at a table. I received my small order of sushi almost 30 minutes later, noticing that the couple who arrived after me and ordered twice as much sushi as I, were signing their check ready to leave.  After paying an outrageous price for one plate of sushi, two drinks and over an hour and a half of time lost-I would not return unless I had hours to kill. I'll stick with my simplistic sushi bars that provide me with good food, prompt service at realistic pricing.  Maybe that is what I get for trying sushi while traveling."}
