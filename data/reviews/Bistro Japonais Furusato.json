{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend with high expectations for some delicious traditional Japanese sushi but unfortunately, we were disappointed. My boyfriend and I ordered various sashimi and maki rolls. Although the fish was buttery, we felt that the rice left much to be desired; the proportion of rice to fish was off and it felt like the rice was stale (dry). We went on a weeknight and the restaurant was full; seating was cramped. We did appreciate the friendly service the waitress provided but there was only one waitress working the floor thus slow service. Overall, given the quality of the food, we don't think that the pricing is justifiable."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, but $82 worth of dry sushi later, I'm not impressed.  Decor and waitstaff were lovely, but the food just did not hold up. If you're looking for high quality sushi rolls, I do not suggest here."}
{"text":"Wonderful spot for dates, small groups, or alone. Has recently become more popular, so definitely get a reservation if you're planning to go on the weekend. Very friendly staff. Extremely good sashimi for Montreal, tasty classic dishes. My girlfriend and I usually split the sashimi platter along with a few appetizers: grilled squid, petit sukiyaki, and entrée tempura especially. For dessert, try the black sesame ice cream. I love this place!"}
{"text":"La devanture ne rend pas hommage a la qualité du restaurant mais il s'agit du poisson le plus frais goûté jusqu'alors. La coupe des morceaux de poissons est parfaitement exécutée, ce qui est de plus en plus rare !"}
{"text":"The best black sesame ice cream I have ever had. THE.BEST. Made or bought, I'm not sure; I was preparing myself for a regular scoop of ice cream that resembled Oreo ice cream with a hint of smokeyness and sesame taste. My friend and I were both surprised when the waitress set down our bowls and we both said to each other in unison, \"IT'S BLACK!\". I don't know where it's from, but I'm on a mission to find out, the absolute best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Very good japanese food and the cutest service you will ever get. Make sure to get a reservation at night because it's usually full."}
{"text":"Really high quality fish. Some of the best sushi I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Service was good - friendly, attentive, prompt. A little pricey, but worth it. Fish was fresh. Salmon was slightly overcooked but tasty. Sushi rolls were wonderful. Tasty salad."}
{"text":"Really good Japanese food. Albeit on the expensive side, the price is definitely worth it. The sushi was fresh and tasted great. The main dishes were also delicious. I've tried many Japanese restaurants in Montreal and this is the best I've found so far. The chefs and waitress are Japanese, so you know it's authentic!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, my entire order was nigiri sushi a la carte. It came sliced large the way I've had at a sushi counter in Tsukiji, big enough that you dispense with the chopsticks and eat with your hands the way people in Japan tell you makes you a true Tokyoite. The place is a little small and fills up during dinner hours, so make a reservation if you have more than 2 people."}
{"text":"Came here in May 2012 and had a seafood and vegetable hotpot. At first I was not too impressed, but the amount of fresh seafood was nice. Near the end of the hotpot, the soup had absorbed so much of the seafood's umami that it became amazing. I'm not sure if I did it correctly, but the seafood was thus slightly bland."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for fresh, delicious sashimi. I agree with other reviewers that the menu feels overpriced -- with the exception of the sashimi platter. The platter comes with miso soup, rice, and 2-3 pieces each of salmon, tuna, octopus, sole, scallop, yellowtail and mackerel (19 pieces in total) for $37. If you're a fan of sashimi, I don't see how you can choose anything but this platter. Usually when hubby and I go, he gets the platter, I'll get a couple appetizers, and we share. Total comes out to about 50 pre-tax (no drinks) and we leave happy, stuffed, and most importantly, not worried about suffering from food poisoning. Because seriously -- is it worth it to spend $20 pp on a dodgy sushi buffet so that you can \"eat your money's worth\" of sushi only to suffer the consequences later? Not for me."}
{"text":"Probablement le resto de sushis le plus sous-estimé de Montréal considérant sa devanture un peu louche. Ce resto offre des sushis simples, mais incroyablement délectables!

Le tempura est, à mon humble avis, le meilleur en ville!  

Les plats japonais proposés sont bons, mais on va chez Furusato pour les gros morceaux de sashimis frais, les makis Heiwa et ceux au saumon épicé. Ce n'est pas le genre de resto de sushis fancy et extravagant, mais il reflète davantage l'authenticité d'un izakaya japonais : une ambiance simple et non-guindée, service respectueux et le chef Akira est tout simplement charmant.  

Réservation recommandée."}
{"text":"This is the place where locals of downtown go regularly to have a good sushi dinner - small venue, fresh food and exceptional cooking. I do not keep track of which waitress works the place but the one we had last night needs to learn her manners. 
So the classical case of large group-small resto happened last night - ie the waitress was %75 attending the 8 person group. Our reservation was at 7:00 PM and she finally came to our table at 7:25 after ignoring an eye contact for what was 10 minutes. OK. The place was full by then. 
An hour later when four tables were empty, she kept ignoring us to put the vegetables in the hot pot of the large group and I can assure you that everyone at that table had hands. 
The outright lack of manners she displayed happened when we went to pay. The waitress that ignored us for 2 solid hours jerked my mother's credit card out when we left no tip and restarted the transaction while repeating \"you left no tip\". We had to state that she was late for everything to make her take her hands off of the credit card. I will not return to this place that I regularly went to as long as she works there."}
{"text":"This is in my humble opinion, the best place to get fair, fresh, delicious and simple sushi. The Sashimi is exquisite and always, ALWAYS fresh. The Nigiri Sushi are outstanding and always perfectly seasoned. The service is always made with a smile, and the ambiance, although it gets loud when full (it is a bistro, after all) is always fun and relaxed. 

Good beer, good sake as well."}
{"text":"This is, i believe, the best Japanese restaurant in Montreal. The sushi is fresh and prepared with love. The sukiyaki for 2 tastes amazing too ! Better get a reservation !! The waitresses are very caring even though most of them do not speak french and sometimes poor english... Anna is the best waitress and also works in the kitchen. If you go there every once in a while, they give you gifts everytime ! The sushi chef remembers your favorite pieces of sushi...!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Montreal and looking for excellent sushi. We were drawn to the simplicity of Furusato, hoping for a satisfying meal of quality, \"no-frills\" sushi. 

The restaurant itself is cozy, well-lit and clean and the service is extremely friendly. However, we did wait nearly 1.5 hours from being seated to actually being served our sushi. The fish itself is good, but the rolls were made with a disproportionately thick rim of rice.

This seems like a nice neighborhood fixture, but not necessarily a place you'd go out of your way to visit."}
{"text":"this place is nearly impossible to find unless you are already familiar with it.   we walked in to order carry out.  we were told it would take 45 minutes to make three simple sushi rolls.  the place was small and not even super busy.   the staff was polite but the food was average."}
{"text":"The quality of sushi was excellent.  That was the only good thing about this place.  There is no reason on this earth that it should take over 45 min to get 2 rolls and I nigiri.   Terrible service.  Nearly walked out.  Also a bit noisy."}
{"text":"Not being a big fan of dynamite rolls with tempura flakes, I was looking to find a restaurant that serves fresh fish and authentic Japanese dishes and here we are!
I love the place; nothing fancy, very ordinary but clean, small but cute and cozy. The fish is extremely fresh you can taste them even sweet (no fish odor at all). Katsudon was very tasty also, will definetely return to try more."}
{"text":"This pace is expensive but they back it up with quality in food and service.

I highly recommended  reserving your table before as its usually packed."}
{"text":"Laughably slow and expensive for random Japanese food. We showed up and waiting for fifteen minutes while looking at the empty tables around us who were waiting for their food. Soulless and unhappy servers and cooks."}
{"text":"Waited more than an hour and a half for 19 pieces of sushi and sashimi while everyone around us got their food (rolls, sushi, sashimi) AND we arrived earlier than those around us. Unacceptable waiting times and their explanation was they were busy with other orders and take out... But we got there BEFORE everyone else!! Food mediocre, nothing great, would NOT return."}
{"text":"Fresh and high quality sushi. Delicious and authentic Japanese dishes. Extremely polite and respectful personnel. 

I have loved everything that I've tried in this place. So, be confident with the menu and I'm sure you will have a great meal no matter what you order.

Tips: Make a reservation in advance since."}
{"text":"best sushi i ever had in Montreal. we order sashimi and sushi combo, tofu as appetizer, some rolls, like spicy salmon and huwaii. its enough for 3 persons. its around 40 for each person. the food deserves this price."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant, downstairs from the street. Old skool Japanese food served by extremely friendly waitresses. We had grilled yellow tail, egg custard with pieces of fish (special!) and beef tofu soup. The black sesame ice cream for desert was divine. Highly recommended. Only thing was we got the check when not finished yet, because the tables are used more times."}
{"text":"I love this place, my go to for sushi! You must make reservation, expect a long wait time and enjoy the night! Sushi rolls are big and wrap with lots of rice but they are delicious! Friendly staff and cozy place!"}
{"text":"The place is always packed and it's wise to make a reservation. The food is extremely delicious. I had their shrimp sushi and grilled fish with rice. It was also very expensive."}
{"text":"unpretentious decor; almost on the dingy side. Very friendly and sweet staff. The food was a mixed bag. Was not happy with the sushi rice, which was not seasoned well and slightly dry. Overall a decent dinner, though slightly on the expensive side for what you're getting."}
{"text":"This cozy restaurant offers a very reasonable lunch.  I enjoyed the Udon and my daughter had the Maki sushi special. The food is pretty simple but fresh. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here--there are much better sushi restaurants in Montreal.  But it's good comfort food at a good price.  The day we were there--at the height of lunch--service was glacial."}
{"text":"Tranquil bistro with tasty and filling noodle dishes as well as delicious sushi (tobiko maki, yum). Asian ambiance and soft music creates the urge to whisper just after opening but within an hour or so, the restaurant has filled up and conversation fills the air. The black sesame ice cream was the perfect way to end the meal."}
{"text":"Furusato is simple, well-done, authentic Japanese food (which is what my Japanese language school told me as well about this place). Don't expect any fancy presentation à la \"Jun I\" or other high end Japanese restaurants, but expect quality ingredients full of flavor, prepared expertly. The beef teriyaki, as pedestrian as it sounds, is superb - just the right balance between sweet and savory, full of beefy goodness, and perfectly cooked - Japanese comfort food really, and the teriyaki sauce is definitely not from a jar. The Japanese salad with seaweed and octopus is a great small dish to start with, and the Yuzu mixed with rice vinegar and soy sauce was a fantastic dressing I was even tempted to drink (thank god I had plenty of sake instead). The Yellowfin collar was perfectly cooked and something you won't find elsewhere. We also had eggplant in a nice tangy broth, and an array of some of the best sushi I've had in Montreal, included the tuna hand roll, and the melt in your mouth unagi and ikura. The service is efficient and very friendly, and this more than makes up for the slightly depressing, dilapidated interior. They should move the dish washing station away from the sushi bar, move the fridge to the kitchen, and have the sushi bar be more of a centerpiece. Still, other than Kazu (which reigns supreme), this is the best place for authentic Japanese I've found in Montreal. Itadakimasu - bon appetit!"}
{"text":"It had been a while since our last visit to Furusato. We remembered eating decadent sushi bites with simple yet tasty appetizers in a very modest decor.
However, the dinner we had last night didn't really live up to our expectations. 
The quality of the fish (especially the unagi) and the rice was good , but I found that there was too much rice in the maki rolls for my taste. I'm not sure if its a maki style and the amount of rice around the nori is different depending on the chef but I definitely prefer a maki with less rice so I can taste more of the fish.
We also had the eggplant appetizer which was really good, a grilled mackerel and some udon noodles (A-OK). 
Don't know if I would go back :/"}
{"text":"We made a lunch reservation on Friday. When we arrived two tables left. Food is fresh. Friendly staff, cosy place. We had Furusato Gozen and Katsudon including salads, miso soup and ice cream. Deep fried pork chop was a bit chewy. Furusato gozen was various taste. The portions weren't big."}
{"text":"A nice recommendation from a coworker that lives in Montreal.  It is small restaurant that is slightly below ground level with no real signage. We walked right by it the first time.  The restaurant is operated by Japanese speaking staff and chefs which is a good sign.  We had the soft shell crab and agadashi tofu for an appetizer, my wife could not get enough.  For the main course we ordered up some sashimi and some maki rolls, the sashimi was fresh and perfectly cut but the maki rolls were a little disappointing.  The saki selection was lacking but the green tea was amazing.  Overall I loved the experience, definitely should make a reservation.  We were lucky and they were kind enough to let us sit up at the bar, which I don't think they use very much."}
{"text":"Quality of seafood deserves 7 starts.
I tried raw scallop (sashimi), so delicious.
Service is great.

The kitchen closes rather early (9pm? 930pm), but the service is still great.

The rare Japanese restaurant, run by Japanese, and most of people there (including customers) communicate in Japanese. 

BEST SEAFOOD"}
{"text":"I had a wholesome bowl of udon for lunch and it was perfect. I loved the ambience and the simple decor. Will go back to try more."}
{"text":"Worst Sushi Rolls ever. Mostly composed of rice with very little fish, and the rolls fall apart so easily.... These are really not skilled professional sushi chefs. I truly do not understand how they can have such overall rating on yelp."}
{"text":"After searching up the best Japanese/sushi restaurant in Montreal (and since Kazu was closed) Bistro Japonais Furusato came up. Seeing so many good reviews on Yelp, I was excited to try it for dinner since me and my boyfriend were visiting from Toronto. 
Boy do I wished we just stopped by any other AYCE sushi places around our hotel.

For $30, we got the 19 piece sushi and sashimi. After a half an hour wait (with only 4 other customers in the restaurant) the dish that came out was something you can get for half that price in Toronto with better quality. 

Honestly, this place was such a disappointment. Everything else was up to par; the ambiance was nice and there's even a corner with Japanese magazines you can browse while waiting for your food (expect to be). The servers were authentic Japanese and we're really nice as well. They weren't as attentive as I would like them to be, but that's okay. 

The food not only took long, but was about AYCE quality except much more expensive. I don't understand why it has so many 5 star reviews; I've experienced much better places in Toronto. I was expected to see aburi but was also disappointed. 

The price range is also more of $$$ than $$. Just letting you guys know."}
{"text":"One of the best Japanese restaurants I've ever experienced! I recommend the tempura entry, the udon noodles and the makis. The portions come in great size. I never left the place with space to eat more. Definitely my favorite place to go in Montreal. I just wish the ambient was not so warm inside."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I can no longer recommend this restaurant anymore as I have had consistently slow service the last three times I've frequented Furusato. I deem the wait time to be unreasonably long. 

During my last visit, after being seated, water was given to us almost 20 minutes later. We had to ask for tea twice after a long wait. The food we ordered came 30 minutes after our water. This was not an isolated incident as the same thing happened to me the previous two times I was there. 

I'm not sure why the long delay but I suspect perhaps the restaurant is understaffed, and therefore, the chef(s) and the wait staff might not be completely to blame. 

Although the food is very good, it is not worth such a long wait each and every time."}
{"text":"This is a below street level tiny restaurant, and most of the tables had reserved labels on there.  I suppose we were lucky to have gotten a table there.

Anyway, service was good.  We were seated quickly, our orders taken, and they kept our water filled.

However, the restaurant is hot and uncomfortable.  I don't know if they have air conditioning or chose not to run the air conditioning.  But if I'm going to eat raw fish, I'd like the place to feel like a refrigerator, not a swamp.  So the eating experience was really dampened by the general discomfort I had sitting in the restaurant.

I ordered the sushi/sashimi sampler, a large platter with lots of very well prepared sushi.  I had never tried raw scallops before.  I have to say, though slightly slimier than I was expecting, raw scallops are very sweet.  I was surprised.  The octopus tasted wet.  Almost rehydrated.  The rest of the fish was good.  Mackerel was very fishy though.  My kids had some rolls, which they gobbled down because they were hungry.  Not sure if they even tasted it.

In any case, the sushi itself was average.  The dining experience was not--it was below average.  So for that, I give the dreaded two stars."}
{"text":"Don't bring your kids!

Stopped here early on a Sat night before the crowds came.

It was half empty and they were about to seat us when the hostess realized we had kids.

Everything changed.

\"Sorry, kids are ONLY ALLOWED ON THE PATIO\".

So, she tells us to wait, sil vous plait, and walks outside to patio. I counted 3 open tables.

She came back a minute later and says, \"sorry, there are no tables\".

To which I replied, there are three or four open tables. WTF?

She shrugged and said, sorry, those weren't available. WTF?

We walked out.

Shame on you people."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy this sushi restaurant. At first we came without a reservation, when they sent us away. I started to make a call to another restaurant, when I was about to leave they came running after us saying there was space now...

We set down and ordered an appetizer, which took 10 minutes for my salad and 25 minutes for my friends soup. Then came our sushi order where they forgot 3 sushi orders. We had to tell them 3 times before we got the other sushi.   

Prices are very good, the quality isn't the best thing ever, but in the end we had a good meal. The restaurant is really small less the 20 tables - 2people/table."}
{"text":"We came on a Wednesday night right at opening time 6pm and happily found a table for 2 without reservation though most tables were already reserved as the place is smaller. The place filled right up shortly after. 

We ordered sushi à la carte.  After handing the order to the waitress, she reviewed and came back saying we ordered too much for 2 people.  And she was right. We halved 3 of our 8 piece orders and it came out just enough!  That was very thoughtful of the waitress to assess our order. 

The salmon sashimi was really fresh. The eel is perfect.  We tried uni that was served in a tiny cucumber cup.  Not sure if that's how uni usually tastes but it was a very strong flavor that I don't recall having tasted before. 

We ventured to order the Ume-Shiso and it was \"interesting\".  The flavor coming from the labiate leaf is a mix of rose water and some other herb. It was unexpected in flavor. 

Overall a good experience. Next time I'd try the other menu items!"}
{"text":"What a great sushi place....The portions were more than satisfying and the service was quick.

The food was very fresh and the menu w
Had a large selection to choose from.

When traveling out of your normal sushi range, it's always a cap shoot....I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great sushi experience."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. This was our 2nd time coming but are a few years apart but both times exceeded our expectations. Their sushi rolls are huge and should take two bites but I just make it fit. The noodle tempura was awesome and flavorful. This place maybe has 12 2-tops and has limited hours so plan well and call for reservations. Our service has always been great and the meals came out quickly. Wish we could take this place back home."}
{"text":"The price is not $$, a normal katsudon costs 12.5, a big sukiyaki costs 55, and I found that there was no ramen in this resto. The worst part is that the waiter didn't serve us with drinking water until I asked her, which was 20 minutes from when we got seated."}
{"text":"I've always passed in front of here but never been. And now that I have, I judge myself for not going here before! It's a really small place, but the food is very good!

We had the salmon sashimi, which was really good quality, and I had the chicken teriyaki. The chicken teriyaki comes with miso soup and rice as a side. Most of their main courses comes with small side orders, which makes it even better! The chicken teriyaki was delicious, and everything was just perfect."}
{"text":"I went there due to the good reviews I saw over the internet. Most of it is true. I went without a reservation on a Saturday night around 8:30pm. Nearly full but we had a spot. Service was good but I guess the kitchen was overloaded because it took a while to get our food. So I guess you have to be ready for this... drinking you free tea.

The food was just amazing and I am delighted to have find that place nearby. It is really good. 

I saw the other reviews... I will definitely go back and will update if I experience something bad (forgotten order, etc...)."}
{"text":"A small neighborhood Japanese \"bistro\" if you can even say that :)
I was taken there by a local friend who lives nearby and she swore it is one of the best Japanese places around. boy was she right!

The place itself is very casual looking, more like a friendly neighborhood coffee shop and not like a sushi-bar. don't expect anything fancy or even close to the average modern sushi place.

The menu is very basic Japanese food, nothing special here. what was special was the quality. we had Agadashi Tofu that was really good and hearty, then we had a sushi and sashimi combo with some excellent ahi tuna, fatty salmon, scallop, shrimp and yellow tail selections. super fresh and melts in your mouth. green tea is of course on the house throughout the meal.

bottom line: expected nothing, and got surprised. for it's style it's definitely a place worth going to."}
{"text":"Disons le simplement le meilleur Japonais de Montréal. Si vous voulez vraiment manger japonais c'est ici ! Pensez par contre à reserver !"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon it on a visit to Montreal. Small place. Friendly Japanese staff. The sushi was absolutely melt in your mouth good, fish was fresh, rolls well constructed. Wasn't cheap but quality was good. Didn't sample a huge amount of the menu because I was on my own, but I would return here."}
{"text":"This resto closes early! We had no idea! We showed up at eight pm on a Saturday and even though they close at nine pm they kindly let us stay till eleven pm. It's a cute small resto and the staff was really nice. The sushi was so good and so fresh!! If u like sashimi it's a must! For those who like fancy makis this place is not for u."}
{"text":"Obviously the Japanese food in Montreal needs a lot of improvement in both food quality and presentation.

I went to there at late night 9 pm. Although restaurant was about to close, I had no problem entering and having meal there. When I was seated, there were five groups of people,  approximately 13 people were there. I was honestly surprised to see so many people in 9 pm.

The first thing I noticed was that the place was horribly disorganized and dirty. The \"sushi bar\" was fully filled with kitchen appliances that there is absolutely no space for a human being to sit down and have a meal. Also, there were dust all over the floor which made me to assume they have not cleaned or sanitized for a long time. The owner of this place should put more care to the sanitation of this place.

Despite the messy and dirty appearance inside, I gave myself a confidence that this place's food should be good since there are so many people in that late night plus some of my friends recommended me this restaurant.

The menu was quite vanilla, namely you can see such menu in any Japanese restaurant. There was appetizer, entree and dessert. As a person grew up in Japan, I found the menu quite boring and unfortunately, I could not find any outstanding characteristics of this restaurant.

I had a grill of saury and katsudon which is a pork frit on rice. Both dish had bit of problems in terms of their taste and how they are cooked. 

First, the saury grill was not fresh AT ALL. It came with guts, which I believe is quite common way to eat saury in Japan. However, if the fish is fresh, the guts should have a taste of bitterness and sweetness. In comparison, old saury gut tastes just strong bitter. Unfortunately, what I tasted was only bitterness, not sweetness or good fish flavor at all. The usual way to grill non-fresh saury is to remove all guts, because grilling the old fish with guts will make the edible part of fish smell and taste horrible. I was quite disappointed with my experience at that point.

Secondly, the katsudon was so thin and way over salted that there is barely no flavor of pork. The way they make katsudon did not impress me. Trust me, you do not want to eat a katsu (fried pork with panko) without any crunchy texture with it. The katsu was so small and thin, plus there was a wired flavor with it. I guess the flavor come from the sauce they use, but I do not have any idea what they use because I have never tasted a katsu like that. The egg with katsu was overcooked and over-salted. I highly doubt that this is done by a experienced chef. The miso soup was sour which is quite wired and not tasteful.

In my opinion, I think this place is good for people who have no experience with Japanese food, however, personally I would not recommend this place to my friend."}
{"text":"freshest fish in montreal!! toro on certain days!! lovely salmon sashimi,yellow tail,makeral, and tuna.

Spicy scallops rolls were great.even their california rolls are tasty.

Service was slow,and a little bit too much rice in the sushi and taste of it could be improved by more sweetness sugar to it.

The wait is worth it for the freshness of the fish."}
{"text":"Had the tempura ramen. I was not impressed, as I wasn't into the broth and nothing else about it was very good.

The service was good, but I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Disappointed. 

I decided to give this restaurant a try because many of my friends had recommended it, and I totally regret my decision. 

We made a reservation a few days in advance. Despite the reservation, they took so long to seat us. 

The food was mediocre and rather expensive compared to the price. They gave us a LOT of rice in the sushi, and it seems like the rice was just plain rice, not vinegar rice. The fish was not very fresh, and the tobiko was by far the worst I have had in my life. None of the food we ordered tasted good. 

It also took them so long to collect our credit card, so we finally had to walk to the cash to pay the bill ourselves. 

In brief, the food is bad, but the service is worse. Do NOT go there."}
{"text":"Small cozy Japanese restaurant tucked away in downtown. Really enjoy their lunch menu. Ordered the maki combo and fish was fresh. Nothing pretentious. Nice courteous staff."}
{"text":"Every single dish an outstanding, owned by real japanese people. It is as authentic as Isakaya on Parc. We had the grilled fish, tofu, eggplant, soft shell crab, sushi rolls and tempura, which was way too much food, i won't bother to order the sushi rolls next time because there way too big and take too much space in your stomach where you should save it for there amazing entrees."}
{"text":"You can find things here that you can't find in other sushi shops. I came here for sushis (and because my lady was craving sushi). So there I was! Looking for sushi! Then I got hungry, really hungry. Started deciding which sushi to get, and finished with the whole plate (look at the photo)! It took some time to receive our order but worth the wait. Mmmmh so many things to say but I don't want to say it so just look at the picture! It didn't come cheap though. For a student, it was a luxury! But did the price explain the goodness of it all? Maybe. The portions (of makis) were bigger than one's mouth could hold. The quality was so uuuugh. The freshness was like if they just caught it out of the ocean and started rolling and cutting. Ooooooh maybe that's why it took so much time!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Futosato for years now. Way back when it used to be Osaka. Good and simple Japanese food  and sushi. I find it a bit overpriced for what it is and the menu is very limited. Here in Montreal, we are blessed with so many good Japanese restaurants and sushi places and this one here doesn't make the cut anymore! It used to be the place to go to when in search of great and affordable food. The service is ok. Sometimes confusing and long. I just don't find that it is worth the wait and effort anymore! Be sure to call and make reservation especially on Fridays and Saturdays!"}
{"text":"This is my no. 1 Japanese restaurant. The food is great. My favorite choices are unadon and sashimi. In fact, everything tastes good. The service is also wonderful and warm. Very nice place."}
{"text":"our hotel was right around the block, and we wanted to go out for Japanese.  Wow was this a surprise. We are huge sushi fans, and like our sashimi very much.  The cut of the fish was superb, the quality superb, the food overall SUPERB!  I know this is a bit of a shock to say, but this meal was one of the best sushi dinners we have ever had.  It is right up there with some of the best of NYC.  The building itself is hard to miss. At night, look for the eave that has a japanese flair to it.  The restaurant itself is a bit nested in under a building.  We were very lucky to be seated, because almost every table had a reserved sign on it. We got the last free table! So reservations are highly recommended.  The atmosphere inside is a bistro style, so don't expect fancy decor or expedited service.  The service was a bit slow, but for food of this caliber I'm willing to wait!!!  We were extremely impressed. We wanted to go again before we left Montreal but didn't have time, but we're actually considering a second trip to Montreal so we can go again! (it was THAT good)."}
{"text":"Been here once, don't like the food I ordered, probably should give it another try, a little overprice"}
