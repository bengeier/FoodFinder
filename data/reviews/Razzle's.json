{"text":"The food and the service each were \"O K\"  but I probably would not recommend this place.  Walked in w/family on a Saturday for lunch and three drunk people at the bar looked at us as if we were from mars.   The waitress was ok, but we had to ask for refills, the check, etc.  She didn't want to be there, however she did a sufficient enough job.  The food was bland, but at least it was prepared properly.  Id go back for a game, but that's probably it."}
{"text":"I've been here once or twice. Volleyball is fun. Danny Mingee plays here so that's not cool but everything else here is.   Get the buffalo chicken tacos."}
{"text":"We go here a lot. If you're going in just for a drink it is great. If you plan to order food, make sure you sit at the bar because you may not be seen by a waitress at a table. The servers at the tables are always terrible. Order food at the bar though the service is usually pretty great. The food is pretty delicious and cheap. Wings are fantastic and taco Wednesday is on point! Fish fry on Friday is very good and their daily specials are always worth a try. Would definitely recommend for a tasty, cheap meal!"}
{"text":"As far as your typical local dive/hangout joint goes, Razzle's has done a great job. I always try to sit at the bar, anyplace I go, but even when I can't, and don't expect good service, they deliver.   The food here is typical of a bar, with great daily specials and other choices, always above average, and always good. They do use well water, so purchased beverages are recommended.    The prices are more than fair for what you get.   The atmosphere is what would be expected of a local hangout place, beer signs, pool tables, jukebox, you get the point.   I understand they also have volleyball courts, and a nice outdoor patio bar for summertime fun too.   If you haven't been here before, understand it is primarily a bar, so my review is mostly based on that.  If you like bar food and are not too concerned with your cholesterol level, check out the menu, I recommend trying the Chicken Philly with some banana peppers and a side of onion rings along with your favorite draft beer, to start."}
{"text":"Food was just adequate. We all had Reuben's that were just \"okay\".  Nothing special! The Pepsi was flat and did not taste good either. The place is supposed to be smoke free but there were people smoking in the doorway. My husband had a chicken sandwich which he said was a bit dry. Had no flavor."}
{"text":"Wow the fun place is properly named! It is a blast to be there and the open roast beef platter on Mondays is to die for! Mashed potatoes, Texas toast, Roast Beef and yum yum gravy! All for 5.95, plus You get to see guys like Bang John Vespa playing volleyball! It's a dream come true! Stop up and open yourself to the magic that is Razzles! Holler!!!!  Can people stop ordering the open roast beef! I know it's yummy but dam by the time I am done playing volleyball they are sold out. Broasted Chicken it is. A close second. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for 2/$5 Tuesday Gyro Special and was pleasantly surprised at how good they were. Hubby and I decided to split the special. I was satisfied after 1 but he enjoyed his so much he decided to order seconds!   Our server was fast and friendly. We found out they have many different league activities going on there from volleyball to pool leagues as well as electronic bowling, golf leagues. They also offer Keno.   Stop on in if you're in the neighborhood. You'll be glad you did! They have a pretty deep menu, many daily specials, the food is always fresh and tastes great!"}
{"text":"The service is inconsistent. The food is questionable (unless you come on Sundays when the wings are on special). The above ground septic system is an appetite killer. The only thing that keeps this place in business are their sand volleyball courts."}
{"text":"Sit inside or at the bar if you want food. Sat outside & waited 37 minutes for the Razzle Boy burger, which was literally a $7 Big Mac. Volleyball is cool. Don't try the well water"}
{"text":"Just not impressed. The food is so-so, the services was meh....the menu is set up really weird, but the prices are ok. I would stop in for a beer maybe, but probably wont bring my family back for dinner."}
{"text":"This is a definition of a 'townie' bar. Classmates and I wanted to experience somewhere new and outside after class one beautiful night.  I wan't impressed with the food at all (I know, I know this is a bar but the bar food wasn't good). We had pizza and it was not good and I will not be getting that again (if I venture back).  The staff was great though! Made our visit very welcoming."}
{"text":"I used to live down the street from this place.  Recently tried it again.  My problem with this place:  the regulars get good service.  So, my question... how do you BECOME a regular when you are all but ignored by the staff that doesn't recognize you?    Food here has been decent.  It's a bar... it's OK.    I am now officially done trying this place.  I don't need validation so badly that I need approval from a bartender or a waitress in a small town bar.  Yikes."}
{"text":"The staff is nice but the owner does some poor business practices. Was at a volleyball tournament there and no outside water was allowed, that is okay as long as you provide a water cooler. He did, which I was like cool, but the water was horrible, spit it out as soon as I tasted it. I found out he uses well water because it tastes bad and he wants to sell $2 bottles of water and $3 Gatorade.  Serving water that tastes like that is wrong. I will never support Razzles business based on his drive for money and lack of customer service and poor human decency. If you are willing to serve bad water to force people to buy water or other beverages, what other short cuts are you willing to take to make money on the food. Judging by the other reviews I assume most people are not happy with the food. Stay away!"}
{"text":"This place is great! It has cheap drinks, outdoor double decker patios, outdoor bar, live DJ's, 3 volleyball courts, and cool bar signage! They have these sweet light up palm trees too! It would be fun for under-agers as well. They can play volleyball and chill outside and the legal ones can drink and be merry!"}
{"text":"Listen. Nice ladies good food. Good people hanging out.  Fesco is my girl. Visit her outside and she'll get you what you need. Taco Wednesday is awesome. Yes only place that had a Wednesday taco special. Not on a Tuesday. Get here and try it out."}
{"text":"A great atmosphere for volleyball tournaments, which are run well and give decent payouts. We sat outside the entire time during the day long volleyball tournament and had great service. Pitcher after pitcher was brought to our tablet and the service was pretty attentive.  If there wasn't someone around, we were able to go right up to the bar to order.  A great place for some summer volleyball fun.  There are leagues and tournaments all the time, most of which are competitive but there are lower leagues if you are interested.  Everyone there is all about having a good time, even the rainy weather didn't put a damper on the tournament.  I especially liked the beer themed umbrellas we were able to use to hide from the rain.  If you are a volleyball fanatic like me, I would check this out on a volleyball weekend and submit a team in!"}
{"text":"Great place especially in the summer, mini tacos are awesome plus you get entertainment from the sand volleyball! Outside the deck is amazing, two stories but great music and plenty of room to hangout with friends."}
{"text":"Best place in this town to stop for a drink and a rack of pool in my most honest opinion.  Haven't tried the food YET but it is ever so tempting.  TVs for games lots of things going on.  Touchtunes cool locals and diamond tables.   Need I say more?  I think not!  Do your self a favor and stop in.  Sand volleyball.  This is this neighborhood's place. Trust me."}
{"text":"Ashley is the best bar maid in town. Friendly service, knowledgable about drink mixes and all around a pleasant person to be around. Food is good and atmosphere is friendly."}
{"text":"I really do like Razzles...  My only gripe is FIX THE FRIGGIN RIDES  IN THE BACK!!  When we come there the food is good, beers are priced well.  If your going to have kids rides..pay the money and have them fixed correctly.  They are broken most of the time..  It helps to occupy them while  mom and dad having some beers.  Also, the chopped veggie basket is nice....kids dont need fried stuff all the time.  Oh, they have volleyball leagues and when they are playing the bartenders seem to cater to them.  Be ready to order everything ya need when ya sit down because they might not come back for a little bit.  You can play KENO too.  The mens room smells like an outhouse too btw..."}
{"text":"2nd time trying this place in 4 years and I live a mile away, now i know why. Food is awful. Atmosphere is pretty cool for the area, so this place is fine for beer and pizza in the summer. Other then pizza, which is what looked like everyone was eating and actually looked good, I will have to recommend not eating anything. The cooks seem to be clueless. Started w wings, they were undercooked and slimy and smelled like chickens that had been thawed for a good while. Wife had crab cakes. Looked like hockey picks. Needed a knife for them! Tried their \"big boy \" burger. Awful. Bun was old and fell apart. Service was sub par. 20 something year olds chatting it up around the bar while you wait."}
{"text":"was here for a fund raiser, the pizza was terrible tasted worse than Frozen pizza and the wings nothing great.  would have to pay me next time to eat here"}
{"text":"This place is quite large with a 2 floor patio with casual plastic patio furniture, indoor and outdoor bar and 4-5 sand volleyball courts, lit at night, that appear to be recently renovated.   Their beer selection is what you'd expect for a suburban bar. 15 taps at the outside bar (about 2-3 crafts) and about 5-6 taps inside.  Food (most entrees are sandwiches with fried appetizers under $10) and drinks are very reasonable priced. There's valued specials like $1.50 tacos on Wednesday nights and the ground beef in them is not greasy. Their 'signature burger' - A Razzle burger is two 1/4 lb beef patties) in between 3 buns with McDonald's sauce. These are the places' saving graces.   The drinking water is from a well and is horrible. None of the 14 people in my party finished their glass of water after we ran 10 miles immediately before coming here. This is frankly unacceptable. To be extremely charitable, it's enterprising, as the customer's alternatives are buying bottled water and Gatorade. It's disrespectful that you would serve it to your customers. Excessive iron is my hunch for the cause.   I'd buy a water testing kit to bring here next time but you already lost about $1,500 of service from me and my 15 teammates for rest of this summer."}
{"text":"Snobby crowd. Crappy food. Even if you try to initiate a conversation, you are not going have someone talk to you. The service is also the worst. If you are OK waiting 5-10 minutes.....fine. Even for bar food, yuk. Just sayin...."}
{"text":"Neighborhood bar  & grill featuring volleyball courts and outdoor patio/bar. Atmosphere is great, but food is just ok. Wings are best bet... stay away from steaks. Service is sub par at best... they are nice, but there are a ton of waitresses but they still take forever to wait on you and forget refills, etc.  Bar is empty most of time during summer when everyone is outside playing volleyball"}
{"text":"We came to Razzle's for Rover Fest tickets and I decided to order a drink while I waited. The staff bypassed me many times, without asking if I would like another drink. However,they approached other customers that arrived after me. This is a very large place and it has a cool atmosphere, but their lack of customer service skills I am sure holds them back. They have a pretty cool food menu online, but we decided not to eat here;due to the horrible service. Just to add we spent about 1 1/2 hour here and we were not offered a menu or assistance. Sad!!!!"}
{"text":"Typically mill of the run divey bar with restaurant. Food is just okay although he menu is pretty expansive. Tricia nights are fun and hey have volleyball leagues too."}
{"text":"Typical bar atmosphere, good prices really, really good specials. Razzle's offers you a basic bar food menu along with a slim craft Beer selection which is why I'm giving it only three stars. It offers Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold as it's only craft Beer choice which isn't all too bad considering it taste great on tap. The food is really good and the service is perfect, Summer time is really fun as well there."}
