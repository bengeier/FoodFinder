{"text":"Helpful and friendly staff who took time for my questions about coffee equipment and brewing. Nice latte with full bodied flavours throughout. Will be going back with laptop to do some work 'off piste' and will report back."}
{"text":"One of the best coffees in Toronto, bar none. This place knows their coffee well and brews it the right way to bring out the best flavours in each roast they use (and they do change it up often). I highly recommend getting an espresso or americano and drinking it black so you can really savour it and get a sense of the different flavours. 

Great space on the interior - lots of space to sit with a friend or solo to work, if a bit crowded with strollers sometimes.  The patio out front is large and a great space. 

The only thing preventing me from giving this place five stars is the generally aloof staff. No, it has no bearing on the coffee and they are amazing baristas, but being friendly to your customers - particularly your regulars - goes a long way. I always try to be friendly and engaging but it's rare that it's reciprocated."}
{"text":"Taste wise, this is one of the best (if not the best) coffee I've ever had. It's like I'm back in Europe, and the taste is so different!
And to make the experience even better, the latte art is beautiful and the atmosphere is very relaxed and good for studying.
It's just too bad the location is so bad for me personally, but it's sometimes worth the hour of public transportation so that I can get quality work done."}
{"text":"The coffee here is okay to good, depending on what you order. Pilot coffee has either gone way downhill lately, or I've just caught them on countless bad days.

One of the women was an owner or manager, and another was another supervisor/barista type. (I have names but I won't post them here.) They actually - no lie - laughed at me for where I am currently living, and mocked other coffee shops and neighbourhoods in Toronto that I said I like to visit.

Now look here, ladies. Your coffee is not that good. It's okay. Stop acting like you're the best in Canada and stop making fun of other Toronto coffee shops (including some who actually serve YOUR coffee!) An embarrassment. Get your head out of the holier-than-thou barista clouds and maybe make better coffee instead.

(Two stars instead of one because the coffee is okay and the new girl on the cash register is nice.)"}
{"text":"Great staff, great coffee! Can't say enough good things! Blueberry muffins are to die for!"}
{"text":"Have been here 3 times now. The coffee is good, the layout of the cafe is nice, the customer service could probably use a bit of work but I guess you get that with a bunch of hipsters that never smile.
Overall a nice place"}
{"text":"Te Aro is my favour place for coffee.  I always stop here or Purple penguin for my cups of coffee and light lunch. beautiful wide open patio and kids and mother friendly.
food seems a bit slow and ok, but I love their full body coffee."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm downtown I always stop by this coffee shop for a flat white.  Their espresso (Big Bro) always gives me a nice zing and the taste/texture is just right.  The taste is  balanced with the right amount of bitterness and acidity. I also like how their micro-foam is consistent every time I go."}
{"text":"I've been to their Ossington location and heard great things about the Leslievile cafe so even though I wasn't particularly craving a latte, I had to drop in.  I love the decor and atmosphere of this place. It's large, open, with plenty of tables. I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was pretty packed with only the bar area left unoccupied. The latte was delicious and made me think why I go to Starbucks as often as I do. 

This is one of my favourites, along with Dark Horse on Spadina."}
{"text":"This place may have good coffee, but their teas are nothing special. For $3 a cup, I got the wrong type of tea, not enough leaves and they don't have honey."}
{"text":"The gluten free muffins have gone terribly down-hill. I had one and it was dry, ok, maybe it's an off-day and it was still edible (my gluten-free attitude is I shouldn't be *that* picky), but then I had another and it was also dry, so I moaned to myself thinking maybe it's over but I love Te Aro so much I couldn't believe it. Maybe, just maybe it was another bad batch, maybe they will change providers - so then came the third and last gluten-free muffin I will ever eat from Te Aro: so dry and cardboard-y, it really was like eating sawdust. Everyone knows I will eat anyones left overs especially if it contains sugar, and I had to chuck half of this in the trash. Completely inedible. So disappointing. I am done with you Te Aro - I gave up on your coffee long ago when I discovered the rich smooth flavour that is Mercury.  I love the staff at Te Aro and can't stand the staff at Mercury, but Mercury espresso is infinitely better and never tastes burnt.

I write this with deep regrets, and maybe if Te Aro reads this and fixes their muffin situation I could see myself going back, but definitely not until I'm assured."}
{"text":"8 bucks for espresso and Almond chai latte.

I am a coffee drinker, and the espresso flavor was interesting (hint of strawberries), but not hot enough for me. 

Almond chai latte has very little hint of almond, but some strawberry?!   

Nice Atmosphere though, love the décor!  

Won't go back...but can't believe how many unique resturants and cafes on this street now...next...PIE..."}
{"text":"Good coffee. Depending on when you go it can be busy. Not comfy and relaxing like tango palace but a good afternoon people watching spot."}
{"text":"The milk for my latte is always consistently smooth n' silky - perfect milk to espresso ratio. Team knowledgable and friendly. Love."}
{"text":"Great space and patio
They roast their own coffee on site.
Tasty coffee, tea, espresso, and fancier drinks.
Although the staff are usually not as friendly as one would expect in the neighbourhood, they are nice enough. And it's great that some of them sincerely love coffee."}
{"text":"Coffee and coffee-shop snacks don't get better than this on the East side. It's a staple of pretty much anyone who lives or works around here. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"So I'm all about the quality of the coffee.

I have been disappointed by coffee in Toronto.  All the \"Third Wave\" coffee shops seem to only use Intelligentsia's Black Cat espresso and on the rare occasion 49th Parallel beans.  Why do we have to go to Chicago or Vancouver to get well roasted coffee?  So the small handful of local roasters I have been to generally don't have discerning barista's capable of extracting the full potential of their beans.  

So then we come to Te Aro.  They know what they are doing with the roast.  They use a fluid bed roaster which definitely has a distinct difference from the drum roasters that everybody else uses.  Better?  Depends on your taste.  Definitely worth a try.  

Their barista are not exactly consistent, which may be changing as they are a fairly new operation.  For example sometimes you get a nice rosetta (pretty leaf pattern in the milk)  in your latte, and other times you get an attempted rosetta.  That being said the shots have always been pulled in good taste and the milk is frothed well.    

The staff have always been super friendly and seem happy to be there.  The space is very cool.  It has a charming little outdoor area, set back from Queen St. enough to feel removed from the hustle.  The inside is airy and tasteful and on warm days have garage doors which open up to the world.  Definitely a nice place to sit and write or conversate while you caffienate.  

In conclusion, I would much rather go to Te Aro for locally roasted and well prepared coffee then go to a bundle of other places in town that do a poor job of extracting espresso from beans roasted in Chicago.  But then I've never been that excited about Intelligentsia's Black Cat.  Add to that the friendly vibe and cool space and you have a great place to go.

{"text":"I recently moved to this area and was doing some exploration of cafes when I found Te Aro. The staff were friendly and the Americano I ordered was strong. Only downside was they didn't have honey to sweeten it, but the free samples at the check out more than made up for this! I will most likely become a regular at this quant little coffee shop."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Te Aro about a year ago, shortly after moving to Riverdale. Looking for somewhere to get a quick bite with friends with an outdoor patio, Te Aro fit the bill. Since then, I've become a regular.
What brings me back to Te Aro is their amazing espresso. Beans are roasted in house and they always have more than one roast in rotation. Favourite drink is their cortado, a double shot of espresso with steamed milk, more steamed milk than a macchiato, less than a latte. Confused? Don't be, just try one. Their baked goods are also very good including their Panini sandwiches. 

Te Aro sells their own line of coffee as well as many brewing devices including the Chemex (what I use at home), the Bodum French Press etc. 

The space is a converted garage which lends well to the open concept, loft feel. Their tables are reclaimed wood, stools look like they are from your high school wood shop, and they even have a bunch of Eames shell chairs. Lighting is good, super cozy. Free wifi as well, perfect for those who work remotely or just want to catch up on the day's blog news. 
A great addition to Leslieville."}
{"text":"I'm really torn about this place.

On the one hand, the coffee always tastes great...EXCEPT when this one barista makes it. He's such a douche, total attitude, and tasteless espresso-based drinks come from him. Where's the coffee dude? Before I was served by him, I had always found the baristas to be nice enough I guess...they're not very talkative and are kind of pretentious but at least they make good coffee. The chai lattes are AMAZING...I never would have tried one until my gf let me have some of hers and I can't find a decent one since trying Te Aro's. 

There are always WAY too many moms and kids. I know it's the neighbourhood but still...they take up all the space inside and out (and it's a huge place). They're SO LOUD and you feel bad smoking near them so it totally ruins my coffee experience. 

But there's something that draws me to the place, the decor is outstanding and I always get lots of work done when I go (as long as I go at nap/feeding time so the babies are gone)."}
{"text":"When I first started going to Te Aro, it was less expensive, had better treats and the coffee actually tasted good. And Latte art is nice, but it's gone after the first sip really... What's important is the actual coffee... right? 
I have had my final bad, over priced coffee there. 
The thing with this place is that it's completely hit and miss when it comes to the coffee depending on who makes it. 
This also goes for toasted bagels, tea and hot chocolate.... 
yet the price doesn't change. 
Maybe they could do it like hair salons where, if someone is new, you can get the service at a 'junior' price??? 
Sometimes they play folk music or new age music, sometimes it's grindcore punk or speed metal or something: which isn't necessarily bad, but if you're not in the mood for what they are playing you are SOL. Especially if, for that day, it's cranked up to 'late night bar music after midnight' level which also happens sometimes. 
another thing: 
They recently stopped using tea pots and are still charging the same price but now just for a cup: too much. 
On a personal note: I find it jarring to see people with dyed, well groomed hair, fashionable clothes, giant sunglasses: latte in one hand, cell phone in the other suddenly turn around and reveal they have a gap-baby strapped to their chest like some kind of designer Quato puppet.... but that's not really Te Aro's fault. 
But the main reasons I'm not going back: 
over priced 
bad tasting most of the time 
hit and miss treat availability"}
{"text":"Can a girl change her mind?
After getting a gig primarily working from home, I've been spending a ton of time in L-ville coffee haunts. 

TeAro is most certainly the best the hood has to offer. Why did I not see it before? The coffee is so freaking good, baked goods awesome, staff super nice (but still pretty slow with the drink-makin') and the patio oh-so-cute. Every drink on the menu is flawless."}
{"text":"First off, I don't drink coffee. I do drink espresso, as long as it's a cappuccino or latte and Te Aro has become my neighbourhood favourite. 

I always get Big Bro espresso which I find to be smooth and doesn't have the harsh punch that Mercury's espresso has. However, the big winner for me is the milk. I drink soy and the milk they use, I believe the brand's \"Pacific\", has the best texture out of any other place I've been. And they don't charge extra for having soy. 

If you're a regular like I am, they also have a loyalty card so every ten coffees, lattes, etc you get one free. It's easy to rack them up!

I do agree with other reviews, if it's busy expect to wait. I've walked in and left before because I knew I didn't have time to commit, but I'll keep coming back. 

I find it's a great place to work. Their music selection compliments me tapping away at my laptop, adding a nice background without distracting. However, there are only two outlets so if you need one to work this might not be the best location for you."}
{"text":"All I have to say about this place, is they charged me $0.20 to use my credit card. I am an owner of a few business and all the power to them, if you're running your business that tight, good luck!!  (Reminds me of the nickel and diming of the airline industry)."}
{"text":"Pretentious/Expensive: the staff are never friendly and I paid $4.87 for iced latte (made of milk and coffee). Need I say more............"}
{"text":"This place is really nice and new. I loved the decor and it was a great space. I tried the mocha and it was lovely. Not too strong of coffee taste and not too sweet. They also draw designs on them which I am a big fan of. There are also different coffee/tea related things you can buy in there.

They also have a patio which I imagine is amazing in the summer time. Next time I am in the neighbourhood, I will be sure to visit this place again. 

The service was great and the prices are average."}
{"text":"Liked that they serve Flat White and their home styled brownie was pretty good."}
{"text":"Love the coffee. My local store serves this brand. I rarely stick around here to drink whatever I've ordered. Great little quaint patio area in the summer that is pet friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place, I love this coffee and baristas... unfortunately Te Aro is far!
Can please open in dt?"}
{"text":"The interior and outdoor seating is nice. Always seems to be busy yet you'll have no issue finding a free table or seat. The service lacks tremendously. The baristas have little knowledge in coffee or teas, and they seem to all hate their jobs working here. Come here for the drip coffee, but don't come here for the pretentious unhappy, unintelligent baristas."}
{"text":"Oh, Te Aro ... MEH.

Coffee is fine, but the best in the city?. NO WAY. My Americano had no punch to it at all and was quite tasteless. Props for their ridged coffee cups though, they look unique and it's nice to not have to fish around and struggle with loading a sleeve onto your cup in a caffeine-deprived stupor. 

I haven't tried their food, maybe it's absolutely stunningly gloriously outstanding, but the bacon breakfast bap I bought as I surprise for my boyfriend was $9.50. NINE FIFTY. And it was small. And it took a long, long time for it to be ready (this was a take-out order).

The staff are ok.

Meh, meh, meh.

I'd come back if I was meeting someone for coffee or brunch and they suggested it, or if they really wanted to go. I'm giving three stars because I don't want to be harsh and overly judge their pricey food without having tried it myself."}
{"text":"One of my few frequented cafes. Great treats and breakfast food selections prepared on site, wonderful specialty coffee drinks (could be a bit hotter though), excellently brewed coffee (it's their own that they supply to others), ample street parking, never so crowded I couldn't get a seat, friendly staff, and reasonably priced coffee, treats and food.."}
{"text":"Te Aro makes the best Mocha. Darkhorse up the street is a close second. I also like  the espresso, it has a unique tart after taste which is preferred to the more bitter presses."}
{"text":"Way too expensive.  I had a coffee in house for 2.25$, just a tiny mug.  I asked if they do refills for free and she said no.  I left and went to another coffee shop down the street for a second cup - way bigger mug for a cheaper price.  Don't go unless you want a rip off.

Atmosphere is great, but that doesn't make up for the poor service."}
{"text":"Good coffee and a nice selection of treats (chocolate chip and sea salt cookies are fantastic!), and all the staff are friendly and helpful.

The space is a converted auto shop wit a bit of an industrial feel with high ceilings, exposed ducts, and concrete floors.  When the weather is nice the whole front of the cafe rolls up and is open to the outside, and they also have a little patio.   

The space is cozy, the coffee is tasty, and the people are nice.  I'm glad this place is just down the street from me."}
{"text":"I like hitting up this joint when I have some work to do.  The place looks sick and they have some different teas and what not, I usually get the ginger.  It gets busy sometimes but because its on Queen East, there's always street parking so its easy to get to.  I wish it was open a little later so I can get work done in the evening but still I like this spot.

The coffee is amazing too, its there special blend or at least something thats available everywhere in the city.

They are a great alternative to all those starbuck fans who like the atmosphere, this place definitely as a sick vibe."}
{"text":"Ironically I have heard of this place before. From my understanding they used to roast right in this cafe. I was looking forward to seeing the exciting task of roasting as this is where my heart lies when it comes to coffee having roasted for some of the most reputable coffee houses and roasters  in North America. 

  Te Aro is a city/town in New Zealand where their is a premium and expectation of good coffee. learning from one of their customers that the owners are from Te Aro and have a family history of coffee roasting. My interest has definitely be peeked.

  The cafe itself is a little boring with plenty of seating and a huge patio out front. While doing a little research I stumbled upon the knowledge that the owner is also a fellow Q Grader. So with that I expect that I am about to get an awesome shot of espresso.  I ask for an elevens at the recommendation of my new found friend Catherine.  

  The Barista did a little calibration before the shot was pulled which was nice to see or it could also be a sign that they have some lazy Barista's (which was not the case here).  The shot was very bright but not offensively bright. Tonnes of fruit with a nice chocolate finish, i suspect there is an Ethiopian as I got some blueberries out of this shot.  I wouldn't recommend having this in a larger milk drink  but it make quite a nice espresso. It was a much more balanced shot than I had at Dark Horse but not mind blowing.  Overall the cafe is cool to chill out in and I decided to take home a bag of Costa Rica El Milena (an excellent coffee I enjoyed a lot last year).

Overall I put it one notch on a belt ahead of the Dark Horse Espresso Bar and a place where coffee is taking quite seriously. worth checking out again."}
{"text":"Great local business. Works with Left Field Brewery too and my husband and I love it."}
{"text":"Not the greatest coffee for the price, I have tried alot better down the street at The Mercury Espresso Bar"}
{"text":"A very cool place in the middle of Queen East. The vibe is relaxed and the food and coffee is fantastic. In warmer weather, it is a treat to sit outside and people watch as pedestrians go by. The Coffee's are well crafter and artistic. The sandwiches and deserts are well portioned and very good.  It is sometimes hard to get a seat as it is always busy. Weekday mornings are exceptionally busy."}
{"text":"Pilots heritage espresso is very impressive. However it seems like they have some dialling in to do with the Costa Rican offering as it was quite sour today. Disappointing."}
{"text":"They make  beautiful coffees here, but was turned off when we saw the cashier using her bare hands to fill the cookie jars after handling money (and not washing them).  Unfortunately I haven't been back since. It's a beautiful popular nook in Leslieville though."}
{"text":"GREAT - Breakfast sandwiches. Best I have had since Marvelous edibles closed. 
They could use a dark roast coffee and a faster moving line would be nice but worth the visit"}
{"text":"Great espresso. Very funky industrial look to the place which I liked. Smells great with the fresh roasting"}
{"text":"I am currently in search of greatest cappuccino in Toronto. This is definitely up there. Great coffee, great atmosphere, great service...great coffee house."}
{"text":"Great tasting coffee, hip crowd , relax atmosphere with free wifi and friendly service.

Nothing much more to write or read.


Actually, one more thing: they roast on site."}
{"text":"Hey I like the cool funky look of the place but its really cold in there. Cement floors and garage door windows look good but let all the Canadian super cold flow in. 

A little expensive if you ask me, $6.50 for an English Breakfast tea and cheese scone.

Well thats the way I see it."}
{"text":"This is a super nice place especially outside patio. I had Almond milk tea and it was super good. I really like the atmosphere and people. There are people who are working, families, and couples. Everybody looks happy and enjoy being there. Bathroom was very clean. This will be my favorite place."}
{"text":"First time in, awesome, delicious, creamy cappuccino.  Second time in, a terrible dribble of something luke warm. I was a little embarrassed because I brought my parents in to show off the place. 
However, the atmosphere is great, the girls behind the cash are super sweet and nice and ill let this one bad capp go. Just this once."}
{"text":"Great coffee and excellent atmosphere. The summer time patio really opens the place up a lot."}
{"text":"Damn! This is some fine coffee!  This is some of the best coffee in Toronto.  Maybe in ANY city!

They select and roast some of the most rarefied beans available in the GTA and all are available for your homebrewing pleasures - but the joy here is really had by sipping a finely crafted cup in this awesome converted garage.  The atmosphere is mellow enough to come and get some quality work done, or to hang out with friends and have a spirited discussion.  The people who work there seem to genuinely enjoy what they do and the barristas display some serious skills.  All of this quality is brought in at a price that is more than fair compared to other cafes - mostly of a lower quality than Te Aro. 

The owners of Te Aro are New Zealanders.  Little known in this hemisphere is that Kiwis are purveyors of great coffee as a matter of both national pride and habit.  It was, in fact, on my very first trip to NZ that I started my life long love affair with coffee.  

Yes, I do confess an extra jolly factor in being able to walk in here and order a flat white without so much as a raised eyebrow.  These Kiwis are so darn hospitable that I even personally witnessed them endure copious amounts of Aussie chauvinism with smiles to spare...

I momentarily considered withholding a star due to the owners recalcitrance in not having opened a west side location EVEN THOUGH I asked nicely.  See mom?  It doesn't always work..."}
{"text":"Of the many independent coffee shops in the Leslieville area, Te Aro is probably my favourite. Even if it weren't just steps from where I work, I would probably come here just as often as I have been. The coffee is consistently good (beans are from Pilot Coffee Roasters, drinks are expertly made), the price is more-or-less reasonable (and they don't charge extra for almond milk!), and I just adore their cookies (my favourites are the peanut butter oatmeal chocolate chip and the chocolate chip with sea salt).

The people are friendly and the ambiance is relaxed to go along with the rustic industrial chic decor. There is plenty of seating indoors and out - I recommend the patio if the weather permits - so this is definitely a place where you can grab a coffee and a treat and settle in for a morning/afternoon with friends, work, or some well-deserved me time."}
{"text":"I used to go to Te Aro quite often.  I love the coffee, teas, lattes, and sweet treats.  They make a good apple brie toasted sandwich.  

Only reason it gets 4 stars is due to the large number of babies/strollers.  The neighborhood is changing so I guess this is the new mum hang out.  It isn't a huge issue but I can't relax when there are babies screaming around me.  Or strollers blocking most of the paths in the cafe.  

I still go...  but I haven't found the best time to go when the baby: adult ratio is low."}
{"text":"I came here on a hot summer day and had their iced cappuccino. I love the patio seating. It's such a cute place. The natural light and airy atmosphere makes you want to sunbathe like a cat but you can't because you're all caffeinated. I love the garage door-style door. Baristas are adorable."}
{"text":"I love this nice Toronto cafe.  The drinks are made with a lot of care and the sandwiches are great. They also carry some gluten free pastries from various bakeries. Always happy to come here."}
{"text":"Cute little spot with lots of natural light, good coffee, and delicious treats. A cookie and medium drip cost almost $6.
I found free parking one street east."}
{"text":"Had high expectations for this place. Ordered an espresso drink which was ok, and ordered a brownie which was hard as a rock. Can't imagine how long it was sitting there for it to be so stale. Place was crowded and seating was limited. Server did not get name right even after correcting them. Was a simple name."}
{"text":"Great coffee!spacious coffee shop with a lovely patio. Very relaxing vibe. I keep coming back every weekend."}
{"text":"Once I saw the extended patio and the open concept, I was a fan of this place from the outset.  Great place to people watch for sure.  I like the benches that are off to the side.  You're not forced to sit at a table.  It's also not packed with tables out in the patio area.  

The indoor set up is very eclectic yet historical.  Very organic.  

I ordered a cold mocha which was served in a jar instead of a mug or plastic cup.  It was very very sweet mind you.  

The baristas were very attentive and friendly.  I know that Faye C had a different experience but I enjoyed my time there.  I would love to go back in the evening or even during the day would be cool too."}
{"text":"The espresso shots have been amazing and consistent each time I've been here. The only thing I'd add to that is the usual clientele are Leslieville's hippest residents, so prepare to be judged!"}
{"text":"I wasn't crazy about the garage-like vibe of this place.  It seemed cold.  My latte was also only slightly about average.  Why the four-stars then?

- Free wifi.
- They take the Indie Coffee Passport, and advertise the fact with a big sign.
- They encourage reuse with a .15 discount for bringing in a reusable mug, .20 if it's one of theirs.
- They have a \"These Come From Trees\" sticker on their serviette dispenser (google it...these stickers discourage use and save trees).
- Staff was friendly.
- Latte art!

'Nuff said."}
{"text":"Went in to get a tea and cookie early Saturday afternoon, June 21. Ordered an Earl Grey. While waiting for the tea I saw the server was giving me Earl Grey cream. I asked him if there was vanilla in it and he said no..I've been drinking earl grey for 15 years and all Earl Grey cream has always had vanilla it in to my knowledge. 

He was super rude, said \"I work here, I know\". To which I replied \"I'm not saying you are wrong, I have just never seen Earl Grey cream without vanilla and vanilla screws my body up\". He again dismissed me and was super rude for really no reason. 

I actually left the tea there because I was so bummed at how mean he was. I left thinking I was crazy and was losing touch with tea naming conventions! I checked their site to see the brand they serve and how they make their Earl Grey cream and......low and behold there is vanilla it in. http://www.pilotcoffeeroasters.com/collections/tea/products/earl-grey-cream 

Customer service can shape a person's day and I would recommend somewhere else if you want good service along with staff who know their products!"}
{"text":"As with my other reviews I only rate the coffee, being in the business.  I was so excited by this place as I lived in Te Aro in Wellington, New Zealand and I was missing the SUPERB quality of their roasting and barrista skills.  Very few ppl have a clue about how to make real Flat Whites like the Kiwis and Aussies and this is the case in Toronto.  I have been here 2-3 times over the past year and I also did coffee cupping.  The cupping experience was fun and the head roaster knew his stuff.  The beans have a wonderful description of their flavour profile and has a lot of potential.  HOWEVER both times I have been I have ordered flat whites and also americanos...i must say HUGELY DISAPPOINTING!  It is all down to the barrista and they failed miserably...sorry!  I actually bought some beans and made some pour over with it and filter coffee...they tasted excellent, so its not the beans!  Anyway unfortunately I have to say go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Located deep within Leslieville, which I'm sure is going to be renamed Coffeeville for all the high ranking cafes in the area, you'll find one of Toronto's more prominent coffee roaster/cafes called Te Aro. This cafe/roaster is housed within what was perhaps a former auto or loading bay of sorts. The whole front wall is a rolling window which I assume is opened during the hot summer months. Inside is a good sized space (which quickly gets cramped due to Te Aro's popularity) with high ceilings over minimalist earthy tones that accent across the cafe. It's comfortable enough a place to sit and sip coffee whether solo or congregating with friends, but I wouldn't say lounge chair comfortable.  

In the right hand corner of the cafe you'll find a large Sivetz fluid bed coffee roaster, considered one of the best coffee roasting machines in the world. The results of which ends up being a bright and delicious cup of coffee to your lips. Te Aro carries a few regular brew coffees which are rotated from day to day (I assume their yummy Little Bro house blend is regularly available) as well as their house blend Big Bro espresso and a single origin espresso. The recent Nicaraguan I had French Press style was delicious as was the single origin espresso I had when I first encountered this place. Price-wise Te Aro is in line with most indie cafes.

Even more reasons to go to Te Aro: If you are hungry Te Aro also offers a large assortment of snacks as well as the more hearty fare of soups 'n sandwiches. I found the staff pleasant and knowledgeable. Worth mentioning and one of the reason I gave Te Aro five stars is that  above everything else they also offer a coffee tasting session each Friday at around noon. A good way to get familiar with fine coffee. 

Te Aro is definitely one of the shining stars in the midst of Coffeeville. I recommend dropping in."}
{"text":"I've practically tried almost of all the highly rated coffee shops in Toronto. I can safely say that Te Aro is at least as good as the best of em. It tastes almost exactly like Dark Horse, Mercury, etc I can't really tell the difference. What they do have over the others is the cups they use are much bigger at the same prices. More value for the buck. The dining area is much bigger also. It is an excellent coffee shop."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee and great space for a meet-up. Be sure to check out the Pilot stand in Union Station as well!"}
{"text":"My go to for coffee in the city. Always recommend the long black or iced latte for those hot summer days."}
{"text":"Probably the most consistently good coffee in the city. Never had even a mediocre one--all pretty great every time. Great selection of freshly roasted beans. Will go out of my way for Te Aro."}
{"text":"Antipodeans rejoice - Te Aro knows what a flat white is and how to execute one perfectly. (How I missed this in the menu at the Ossington location still astounds me.) 

Second-to-last stop on our Yelp Indie Coffee Passport UYE, our big group struggled slightly to find room to sit and consequently took over the big communal table. There's not much other seating here, so save it for a visit on your own or a couple of people at most. 

The feel of Te Aro is like walking into a workshop or something similar - big shelves take up one wall, filled with coffee-related paraphernalia; you'll find lots of wood/metal/concrete amongst the minimalist decor.  Up front, the counter has an array of baked treats, and on the wall is a big chalkboard menu. 

But really, the most important part is the coffee - first up I had a soy flat white, which was pretty much perfect (only a slight hint of bitterness, but the foam/milk ratio was spot-on). After seeing Eliah H with his french press, I one-upped to a one-cup of my own, one of the special blends on the chalk-board. They have soy out with other milks to add (yay!), so after my little timer went off, I happily sipped my cup of joe - a damn fine cup that Special Agent Dale Cooper would be proud of. 

Te Aro, thanks for bringing a little Aeoteroa to Toronto! (Try saying that 5 times fast.)"}
{"text":"The best and cheapest almond milk latte in the city - $4 for 16oz.  Service is always friendly and they actually listen to your individualized request.  Edibles are tasty although not overly exciting.  I go 2-3 times a week and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is more about atmosphere and attitude than the coffee or food, and yes, there is a market for attitude (I'm not buying any but people do)..  Te Aro has great decor and I do enjoy the room, the quality is substandard really. My feeling is if you are good, you don't need attitude.. I don't find myself coming back."}
{"text":"Overall - 4.0/5.0

An excellent cup of latte can definitely be found here. Milk texture is on point and the espresso flavour is bold enough to come through the milk. 

This coffee shop will definitely be one of my top 5 joints to hit up, although it is a bit out of the way for me."}
{"text":"I came here after a cappuccino that left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended) I thought to myself what better way to cleanse by going  to a cafe that is ranked very high in the city. A fellow Yelper whose opinion I respect had recommended this place for cappuccino.
The initial impression was nice as there is a very nice sitting area in the front. I was like oh goodie I can smoke my cigar here and enjoy my drink outside on gorgeous day like today. The interior is open and quite nice. Very inviting and it showed as they place was packed with people (a lot of strollers but I guess thats part and parcel of being in this neighborhood)
The cappuccino here is tradional sized so don't be expecting huge mugs here. Nevermind it does it well where it matters.
Espresso: Strong
Crema': Excellent
Milk: Frothed Well
Latte Art: Beautiful.
High praise here folks as this is one of the top spot for this hard to master drink in the city. I would even say it can go toe to toe with the best of best in Canada. 
The service is also quite good even though they were quite busy."}
{"text":"Te Aro is a spacious coffee shop with plenty of seating and natural light. It's wheelchair friendly too. Their coffee is pretty good and their almond chai is very smooth but a bit on the mild side. If you like your chai extra spicy, stay away. Sandwiches are good, too, and they come prettily tied up with a string for you.

The three stars come from the overall pretentious vibe. I prefer my cafes to be friendlier and cozier. The price is a bit steep for what you're getting. As good at the drinks and food are, I wouldn't regularly pay that much for the quality I got here. There's better in Toronto for cheaper."}
{"text":"The Americanos here are amazing!!!! This coffee shop is a great spot in leslieville. They have a wonderful layout with a nice patio in front of shop. Interior is very interesting mix between modern and authentic vibe. It has a great seating arrangement with an open and friendly atmosphere. Pricing is very fair and standard for speciality drinks. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"This review is short and simply to praise their espresso. 

Being an avid espresso drinker I decided to check this place out when I was passing by the neighbourhood. When ordering I was taken by surprise that for a 'simple' espresso cup I had three options in terms of flavour. I can't remember which fancy one I chose but damn, that thing was good! 

I'll come back to try the others and some of their food too, at which point I'll provide an updated review."}
{"text":"Great space, very busy but I can see why after visiting. Met with some friends here last Saturday afternoon, it was a fun two hours sipping on amazing coffee and tea and indulging in some tasty snacks. Would definitely recommend to others when in the area!"}
{"text":"Visited Te Aro today and had one of the best Americanos I've ever had in Toronto accompanied by an amazing apricot coconut cookie in a beautiful busy coffee shop. Why two stars?  Obnoxious (hip hop?) music blasting through the café. Other customers, many with earbuds, didn't seem to mind. I did. A lot.  Guess I'm not their target customer. Couldn't wait to finish my coffee and cookie so I could get out of there. I'd go back, but for takeout only."}
{"text":"There's something off about the coffee here. I only drink it black, so I've become quite the critic when it comes to decent coffee. The Americano tastes old, bitter, and syrupy. After being roasted, coffee beans are only fresh for a few days, if that. They should be stored in vacuum packed containers to retain the initial freshness. Then there's that whole issue with grind, ideal water temperature, etc.
I'll stop bitching now. 
It would be great to find a decent cup in Toronto, and this place has the potential. If only Te Aro knew how to roast and store coffee beans properly. 
On a side note, the baristas are (usually) likeable."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Te Aro is in a nice little area- recessed from teh rest of the store fronts on the street. I like its charm very much. 

The actual shop was very cozy inside and very minimalistic in terms of decor. It had homey little things hanging from the walls, and that was about it. The staff are okay... seemed to have a bit of that hipster/douchebag swag, but it's okay haha. 

I had the hot chocolate when I was there... only because I expected great things from what my friends were telling me about this place. In theory, it wasn't bad. You could tell that they didn't use some powdered mix for their hot chocolate, but it was a little too \"unsweetened\" for my liking. I really think taste is all a personal preference, but it was pretty good. It also had that awesome creamy texture that instant/premade/crappy hot chocolates lack. Overall, I was pretty happy with it. Prices can be a little steep, but hey, you get what you pay for. 

I'll probably come back if I'm ever in the area again. I'm interested in trying some of the food that they had there as well."}
{"text":"Great coffee, chill place, outdoors seating, free wifi. Everything you need from a cafe!"}
{"text":"i really enjoy pilot coffee.
this was one of their only locations open on labour day so we came here for some beans and a cup.
the location is nice and spacious.
they offer all of the current pilot coffee bean selections, yummy coffee drinks, and pastries.
i really love that pilot coffee offers a true flat white at all of their locations."}
{"text":"One of the best cups of coffee/espresso in the east end, decent treats and wifi. A front patio and big garage doors that open up. It's a great place to go for an espresso or coffee.

They also sell coffee that they roast in-house, which is quite good, and with roasting dates on the bag (important if you're interested in 'freshly roasted').

Finally, they have a decent if not amazing selection of well-selected (trendy) coffee equipment:  aeropress, chemex, pourover, hand grinders, etc."}
{"text":"My favourite place to grab a coffee in Toronto. In a great location as well."}
{"text":"I've just enjoyed a couple hours relaxing and plugging away at my computer at Te Aro. I really love the vibe there--very cool decor, great people behind the counter and, of course, excellent coffee! I'd have to say I'm a coffee fanatic, and Te Aro's brew doesn't disappoint.

For many years, Leslieville had very few options when it came to coffee shops, and now there are so many, sometimes it's hard to choose which one to go to. I actually rode my bike past Te Aro on my way to Dark Horse, but decided to turn around and give it a try. I ordered a cup of El Salvador, perched myself at the communal-style table and split my time between people watching and writing. The room is large and airy, and even on this scorching hot day it was relatively comfortable.

But what sets Te Aro apart from their local competitors is the fact that they roast their own beans in micro batches to ensure a fresh product. You can just tell that they really care about their product. My coffee was a great reminder that it's such a good idea to support local artisan operations like this one. The quality is high and the price is relatively reasonable.

I wouldn't say Te Aro is my favorite spot in the city to grab my morning--or afternoon--jolt, but it's definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"CUSTOMER SERVICE: The staff was very helpful as to what is best to my liking. They were very patient with me and my family which I really appreciate!

FOOD: I got the Cortado with a Buffalo Chicken sandwich. The coffee was very nice, smooth, and strong, just one of the ways I like my coffee. The sandwich was very appetizing as well! 

I would suggest this place for some good coffee, cute area, cozy and modern setting."}
{"text":"Went last week again, after 1 year. Coffee is still very good and service is still excellent. 
It just..just..i am kinda disappointed right now I don't get a the pot for french press.. they pour it to a cup.. which makes sense since it is a busy day.

I am kinda disappointed by the bakery choice that day too. Used to love the almond croissant there, this time only some chocolate one taste descent but not surprisingly good. 

Also, they use to serve tea and water in a cute jar look mug from pottery barn, I like it so much that I even went to bought two for myself !!( all my friend saw it, ask me why u drinking water from a jar??), they don't have it anymore. Right now only small glasses.

Don't get me wrong, still LOVE this place, and they still have great coffee, just for one of my fave spot, I have higher expectations and it is the weakness in my human nature that.. I hate changes."}
{"text":"Rented a bike downtown to ride across the bridge to check this place out. My Big Bro latte was perfect and super enjoyable, even on a 90 degree plus day! Definitely in love with the tall communal tables and vintage chairs. I was super pleased to have found a great artisan roaster while on vacation and only wish I could have made it out more than once. For now, I'll just be showing Te Aro love in the states with the t-shirt I bought there and accompanying story. :)"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee & great vibe - if a bit pretentious. The outdoor seating's a bonus too."}
{"text":"I really love the friendly atmosphere and the fact that there are lots of places to sit. Great sandwiches. Coffee is good. They roast their own and offer coffee tasting classes that are a lot of fun, but more about learning than sipping coffee so be prepared!  :)"}
{"text":"Coffee here was o-k.  Nothing to write home about.  Liked that they had dairy free options for milk and service was relatively quick, but it was a bit chaotic and the staff behind the counter seemed a bit rowdy.  Best part of our visit was the pear cider - would definitely have the cider again but not go out of my way for coffee here."}
{"text":"Te Aro Cafe is a retrofitted garage which has carved out a spot in my heart. My first impression of the place was \"Coooooool!\" 

Owned and operated by the darling couple, Andy and Jessie, alongside with their equally cool staff - they make fantastic coffees sourced from Fair Trade and Sustainable operations all over the world. 

Passionate and insanely knowledgeable about the science of coffee, they host a free \"Cupping Sessions\" every Friday at 12:30 PM where they personally guide you through the intricacies of tasting and profiling coffee to help you cultivate a finer appreciation for it. The cafe's \"cool vibe\" and fantastic patio serve as a great spot to chill out and connect on a date."}
{"text":"Third on \"Kat F - Miss U Crawl\" I head to Te Aro which seems to be the FAV of most people.  I picked up an Indie Coffee Passport here, thanks to a tip from a fellow Yelper.  This place actually makes you walk through all the customers sitting in the Front Patio and the Interior before you can get to the counter at the back.

Cappuccino took some time to prepare as I sat on one of the creaky metal barstools that I thought I broke from a screeching noise but it's suppose to be like that.  At least I hope it is.  My Cap looked normal but as I drank the flavours of the Crema really stood out and what's more amazing is that the Crema and flavour was endless as you can see from the bottom of my cup.

I was served by a new girl which doesn't know all the answers yet but she puts on a nice smile and greets people.  This place can be considered a large place as far as independent Coffee spot is concerned but this Sunday evening close to 5 pm, it was 75% full of customers."}
{"text":"The space is very inviting for people to come, have a drink, munch on a snack, and chill.

I really liked their pear and ginger cider.  I have never seen that before on a menu aside from the traditional apple cider.  This was really refreshing and warming.

The place is always hustle and bustle with people dropping in for a cup of coffee before being on their way or waiting for a table nearby.

Great place and even better in the summer when the front patio space is open."}
{"text":"A trendy coffee spot in Leslieville that doesn't sacrifice coffee or style/decor. This place roasts their own blends and serves up an amazing cappuccino. In addition to having great coffee, Te Aro also holds \"coffee classes\" so you can taste and learn about various coffees.

Definitely try it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Have been exploring the Queen East area lately and have fallen in love with this 'hood.

Ventured here with a coworker and tried a mid afternoon Americano. The coffee was very good, nice and smooth, not at all bitter. They also had a small selection of sweet and savoury goodies which looked tasty.

Staff were friendly and I enjoyed the relaxed vibe. Seems like a great place to sit and visit or bring a laptop to get some work done.

Interesting artwork - was that a buffalo with a man bun painting at the front door?"}
{"text":"Are you a proud discerning coffee snob, a summer patio fiend, wheelchair-bound latte art collector, or perhaps a neighbourhood mama with kids in tow and a yearning desire to sit down somewhere outside? Do you dream of a relaxing, bright and spacious, hip and unpretentious place to express yourself with your presence over a warm cup of java and munching on yummy goods or breakfast sandwiches fit for every diet?

You probably suffer from... well there's a mouthful of an acronym for your condition to make it sound like a legit medical condition, but I am too lazy to make one up.

However, there is a treatment to alleviate your suffering: Visit Te Aro Coffee on Queen East. Baristas are standing by. Side effects include having to open your wallet wider though--surely there's a name for that condition also.

{TTC: take the 72 or any Queen Street streetcar to Queen/Carlaw.}"}
{"text":"This is a nice place in the hood.  In the summer they have a nice patio.  The coffee is ok, but baristas are super cute but slow, which left me thinking, maybe they hadn't had their coffee yet that day...

Lots of people hanging out and it has a nice vibe."}
{"text":"I've been to Te Aro several times.. and every previous experience has been subpar when it comes to the service.....until this time. I was there for quite some time, ordered a Pear Green tea (which is absolutely delicious), and now that they make baked goods.... I could not resist but to try a Ginger Molasses Cookie.

Top Knotch! I love my cookies soft and chewy and I could just tell that this was a winner as I ripped a piece off. It was not overly sweet and the cookie was moist and absolutely delicious.

I love the open space and the cool tunes that are played every time I'm there. I even heard that they do a cold brew, which I will have to try one day. Lunch would also be a good option as the sandwiches on baguettes look rather tasty.

Until next time!"}
{"text":"I've read so many blogs and forums saying how great Pilot Coffee Roasters and how good the coffee is at Te Aro. Since I was in the area, it only made sense to pop in and give it a go. I have to say....it certainly lives up to the hype. I got a cortado, which was every bit as good as Farenheit , my go to place in the city. My only complaint is that every time the door opened, a blast of cold air whipped though the place. Don't know if there's any way to fix that."}
{"text":"One of the loveliest cafes. I'm not sure why it's so nice, but it is. It's a bit overpriced, but of course we'll all spend that money here and have a latte or espresso because everyone says it's good right? Don't worry, I'm not judging. 

I love coffee. It smells great, tastes great, and makes me feel great. I don't find there anything to be too special with te aro though, no offence. 

On thing that stood out for me though was their patio. During the summer, it's absolutely so lovely to sit outside on the patio. It's such an open space concept type of place and a great area to have a small date, chat or even some studying time. 

They also make really pretty coffees."}
{"text":"Te Aro has great coffee and, for the kids, excellent warm apple cider with a cinnamon stick.   The patio out front is a great spot to people watch and, because they don't serve there, you can bring pooch right to your table.   Some of the staff seem a little grumpy.  Maybe they didn't get their morning coffees."}
{"text":"Great drinks and baked goods.  Atmosphere is great.  Great for pets too with set back front pad for your dog."}
{"text":"I still stand by my distaste for their lack of power outlets, as I sit here on my laptop watching the power descend ever so quickly. Maybe they want me to leave right after my first coffee and I guess I shouldn't hold that against them. Besides that, I do think this place is pretty cool. The interior is still hip and it seems to attract a rather cool crowd. The coffee is tasty and I was served by a very pleasant lady who didn't seems to care that I had no clue what to order and the correct way of ordering it. 

The bottom line is the space here is fantastic and maybe I got so mad at the lack of power because I would love to spend endless amounts of time in a space so well designed, populated with neat people, and has a perfectly cool curated soundtrack that makes me feel oh' so hip while I sip my Misto. There's a great amount of seating here, an awesome patio for people watching. The truth is I like this place and I'm glad it's in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I've been going te aro for about a year now. They make some of the best espresso based coffee in city. Their cappuccino and lattes are consistently good, and their teas are pretty decent as well. Their food is ok, standard Cafe fare and will do if you like to nibble. The only downside is that it can get a little noisy and cramped at peak times."}
{"text":"went in to grab a cup of coffee on a Friday afternoon. I only drink brewed coffee (I've worked at a coffee shop for several years) and I can say with confidence that te aro/pilot roasts their coffee right. their ridged paper cups are brilliant because the design allows you to hold the cups without using any sleeve - which saves money for the business & supports their 'green' initiatives. lovely patio as well. 

coffee - 5/5
patio - 5/5
vibe - 5/5
washroom - 3/5
bang for buck - 4/5"}
{"text":"An absolutely lovely place to relax, have a hot cup of something-or-other and a sweet nibble. We got the opening times of a local shop wrong but that's okay because Te Aro was open to shelter us for an hour or so. Even happier we were able to snag one of the few open seats when we arrived.

I had a london fog and shared a breakfast sandwich and a scone. Everything was well made and delicious. The winner of the meal was definitely the scone, I loved the caramel-y crunchy outer layer. The prices are admittedly on the higher side. We could have had a full meal somewhere for the price of two drinks and two snacks, but you get quality food, great ambiance and friendly service.

What a perfect way to start the day!"}
{"text":"Pilot coffee. Excellent ambience. Awesome patio. Great for a casual date or to meet friends. Or to plug your media device and do what you do best"}
{"text":"If I had a picture with a caption that said \"herein lies a hipster coffee shop\", this place could definitely be the subject of said picture. Nice open space, modern but rustic, large windows, bright, very neighbourhood-coffee-shop feel. We visited on a Saturday morning and the place was very busy - crowded with families, kids, young couples, singletons reading books while drinking their morning coffee, etc. It's a coffee shop that welcomes people from all walks of life, and has a very warm and inviting atmosphere.

I purchased one (1) Latte to-go and it was quite good. Nice and bold, not too milky. I quite enjoyed my drink, but I enjoyed the atmosphere just as much. I'd definitely come back here when I'm in the area - it's a place I'd be comfortable doing work in, having a coffee date with a group or on-on-one, or just to sit and enjoy a drink before going about my day. Overall, a great spot.

For my drink, I paid a little less than $4.00."}
{"text":"Perfect for strollers. Staff seems too friendly at times, reminds me of being at Starbuck's. Music selection leaves something to be desired. Definitely not pushing any boundaries with ambience.  Too conservative for me but coffee does taste ok. I've only ever gotten americanos and filtered coffee.  Has a great patio right on the street. I'd go back but since they close stupidly early-8pm- I am forced to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"#indiecoffeepassport #8 

After we filled our stomachs with sushi, we continued our Indie Coffee Passport crawl to Te Aro. 

When we arrived, the café was already bustling with activity. If I'm not mistaken, Te Aro might be one of the few cafes open in the area on a Sunday. 

The overall vibe felt comfortable albeit a bit noisy for me, but I do think that as a large group, we contributed towards the noisy environment. Personally, if I came here by myself to do work, I wouldn't be able to concentrate. But I was meeting with, or was with a group of friends, then Te Aro's a good place for it. We were here for at least an hour where a game of Uno broke out and my friend Mark, who was in the neighbourhood, joined us for a bit. He also became initiated into the cult and favourite time waster otherwise known as Yelp. 

I really like the décor: a contemporary feel with beautiful dark wood tables and shelves, a lot of industrial accents, and plenty of light. I'd like to return here in the summertime and sit on their patio. 

As for my coffee, I ordered a regular cup of Joe which tasted good since they roast their own beans. But Mark's cappuccino looked really nice and from what he told me was yummy. I'll have to order it the next time I'm here."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, fully accessible location including washrooms, friendly staff AND vegan options!

I went here last week and had a soy latte (I think they also have almond milk) and a cookie. The vegan dessert was a delicious supersonic cookie supplied by Bunners bakery. I wish they'd have some more options though. A vegan savoury treat would be great!

It's hard to find a local coffee shop that is fully accessible and even harder to find one that is accessible with vegan options. Te Aro fits the bill!"}
{"text":"My first time at Te Aro though I have come across the name in reading up on coffee houses in Toronto.

Through the course of a few hours, had both an americano and a cafe latte. I found both to be very enjoyable, as the espresso was pressed well and tasted great. The latte art was also enjoyable.

The ambiance, atmosphere and crowd here is something to mention too. My friend and I sat inside the cafe, and I really enjoyed the layout and industrial feel to the place. There was farm equipment and crates/etc. around the sides. Seating was plentyful from long benches to individual tables. In addition, there was plenty of outdoor seating set up the particular Sunday we went. 

My friend avoided any of the pastry/food selection after having a look - none looked very appetizing to her.

I really enjoyed observing the crowd coming in and out of Te Aro. From artsy hipsters, to elderly folk, couples, families, those out walking their dogs - it feels like a great place to both spend some alone time doing work, or hanging out and chatting over a warm drink.

I would return if in the area - I am a fan of the Leslieville neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Tried the latte here. Came topped with heart foam art which was cute. But I didn't really like the latte itself. It didn't taste smooth. There was this burnt taste to it. Tried the drip coffee. Didn't really like it either. If I  had a better grasp of coffee language I might be able to explain why I didn't like it but I don't. If anything it tasted acidic and I guess I like a more smooth rounded roast. The butter tart i had was delicious though. And the atmosphere of the whole cafe is really nice. One can easily spend an entire day here."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop ambiance for a Sunday afternoon. Good music, comfortable space and delicious Mocha. Really nice to catch up on an hour of work."}
{"text":"This place is spacious and lovely. The huge patio is great for hanging. I was lucky to get prime seating on the bean bag chairs with my friend this afternoon.  I could have fallen asleep there, were we not having a business meeting!

A bonus for me, they sell Sweets of the Earth cookies which are vegan. I also like that the soy milk is right up on the bar with the other condiments, as it should be! I hate asking for soy and being charged at other coffee shops! We stayed in, so we were served our coffees in perfect form. My friend had a beautiful looking latte in a big mug and my iced americano was served in a old fashioned jar with a handle. So cute!

This was first trip to Leslieville (lame, I know). I've been wanting to check out lots of places along the Queen East strip and Te Aro has made me want to return immediately. I'm confident there are other gems like this place just around the corner!"}
{"text":"Having my first London Fog in years and enjoying the outdoor seating :) Speedy, calm, friendly service!"}
{"text":"Finally tried Te Aro and I wasn't disappointed. Their iced mocha is good and their cookies are really good. I loved the space, especially the patio."}
{"text":"Beautiful laid-back cafe with a great atmosphere. They have everything to make you feel right at home -- massive \"sumo\" bean bag chairs, newspapers, design magazines, good tunes, and a jug of ice water at the counter. The patio is pretty big and quiet. Staff actually seem to enjoy their job -- always a plus! My cappuccino was pretty average (almost no foam to speak of though), but all the other good things make up for it."}
{"text":"I want to give this this place a higher rating, but they don't deserve it.

I've been here a handful of times & each visit just seems to get progressively worse. The coffee itself is quite good (once you finally get your order- more on this issue later).

5 stars for the ambience & layout of this cafe. There's plenty of seating, huge patio, free wifi etc. Usually they're playing decent music & the customers who stay are either working away on their laptops or the dreaded stroller blocking moms.  Either way, there's plenty of room for everyone.

So why the low rating? The staff. I've noticed the person at the cash taking my order to be cheerful, pleasant & helpful when deciding on what to order.  Then that person disappears & you're left waiting for your drink.....

5, 10.... maybe 15 minutes later, your drink may finally arrive. I'd love to be over exaggerating but I've actually had to wait this long. And no, it wasn't because it was busy, or that they \"forgot\" my order. The baristas simply have other priorities.

I've watched and waited while they serve their friends, chat amongst themselves, take off into the back etc.. All while a few of us customers will patiently wait for them to essentially provide us with what we've paid for. I don't think it's unreasonable to have to wait a few minutes for a hand crafted beverage, but the lack of customer service is appalling.

That being said, will I ever go back? Never. I gave Te Aro a fair chance multiple times because I don't think it's fair to base a review on one visit.  

Luckily, there's a bunch of way better coffee shops you can find in this part of the city (Mercury, Boxcar Social, Dark Horse... Just to name a few). Don't waste your time or your money here."}
{"text":"I really like this place. There never seems to be enough seating inside, so it's nicer to come in the summer since there is a huge courtyard/patio out front. I wish there were less people sitting there with macbooks taking up prime space. Also, people bring their dogs inside and I can't say I'm a fan of that.

The tea and coffee are very good quality."}
{"text":"One of the many coffee shops in Leslieville area that caters to coffee connoisseurs, enthusiasts and beginners alike. You can have regular brew, traditional Latte, an Americano or my all-time favourite, a delicious Cortado. Sandwiches, panini, salads, cookies and slice of delectable cakes are available to pair your chosen drink. 

Well, why the 3-stars then, you ask? This place is really busy which makes it hard for patrons with children to get a table. I do wish the seating arrangements will be redone not just cater to individuals on long tables or couples on 2-person tables. There is literally so much real estate to fix this.


Overall, not a bad place to hangout. I might come back with my buddies or my wife. Probably not with the kids, though."}
{"text":"Why are you so far away from me, Te Aro?
I know they don't make their croissants on-site but it was the best croissant I have every had. Great latte too. If I lived nearby I'd be here every day just for the croissants! I highly recommend visiting."}
{"text":"Te Aro is as good as it gets when it comes to cafes in this city for me.  Having recently moved into the neighborhood, Te Aro quickly became my local favourite and regular weekend hangout spot.

The cafe itself is great - big converted garage (?) that is a treat on warm days, and the free wifi and abundance of indoor and outdoor seating really add a lot of value.  Being set in from the street lends itself to having a great patio too, and Te Aro does not disappoint.

The espresso does not disappoint either.  They roast all their beans in house and it's evident that there is a lot of care and effort going into the product they serve.  I've never been disappointed by the lattes or drip coffee I've ordered.  

All in all, great coffee experience, and highly recommended to anyone in the Leslieville area."}
{"text":"I love this place. 

I love the location; set back from the main street in a little nook between a florist's and a store for baby gear. The view isn't much, but the window seat's perfect for an afternoon of reading and people watching. 

I love the clientele; the strangers on my side of the glass are just as interesting, not to mention superfriendly and sweet. My first visit was on a Wednesday, just after noon, and the place was comfortably packed. Frequented mostly by locals who know their coffee, there's a nice mix of people typing away on sleek Macs (Starbucks has nothing on Te Aro's superb WiFi), friends chit chatting over a cuppa, dog walkers popping in for a quick to-go, and the occasional stroller or two. 

I love the coffee; OH the COFFEE. Te Aro does their grinding in-house, and if you glance to the back, you'll spy the gleaming beast of a roaster that works the magic. They do a lovely dirty chai here, and having sampled the chai latte as well, that shot of espresso really does make all the difference. It really would be shame to leave Te Aro without trying something involving their specially selected beans - this coming from someone who doesn't exactly handle their caffeine well. Yes, I was jittery for the next five hours or so, but would I try a straight macchiato next time? In a heartbeat.

I love their latte art; this deserves it's own special mention. Consistently gorgeous. There's a reason why the tip jar is never empty, and I'm not talking about the rubber duck someone put in. I'll never understand hipsters, but I digress.

In conclusion, super determined to become a regular at this lovely coffee joint! I'll be the girl reading Ishiguro on the second window seat from the right...come introduce yourself!

{"text":"This place is completely fabulous. I used to live right around the corner as a student and spent a lot of time studying here. They make an amazing cup of coffee and always have interesting snacks. Lots of cool coffee accessories and take home products. In the summer they have a fabulous patio which is amazing for people watching. Really cool space and all around great cafe."}
{"text":"I. Really. Liked. Te. Aro.
I. Really. Dislike. Strollers.
These two things seem to go hand in hand.

The good:
- The roast their own beans (but they aren't good beans)
- They have the same pastries and muffins as dark horse (but a bit less expensive)
- There are some good baristas here (scratch that, Emma quit.)
- There is a big patio out front
- The decor inside is lovely - I am especially enamored with the solid wood communal table - it has beautiful butterfly joints
- They usually play good music... Te Aro single handedly rekindled my love of Wild World performed by Cat Stevens

The bad:
- there are some bad baristas here/new baristas (new to the trade itself)
- the lids for the take out cups are like sippy cup lids - it's just weird and I don't like it
- sandwiches are expensive (but they have sandwiches!  kind of makes it a neutral)
- It's always full of people with babies.  I like babies better than children, but I hate strollers.  Te Aro caters to the stroller crowd.
- Their wifi requires a randomish 16 bit hex key that they keep in a cup under the counter and always kicks me off.  Thankfully, someone close to them has an open network (that is much more reliable).
- There are no bike racks and they don't plan to get bike racks.  The closest city bike posts are outside of view so I never really ride my bike here because I am pretty confident it will be stolen.

I have recently downgraded this review to a 2 star rating.  I don't really even go here anymore.  I don't like their coffee and I don't like the other people who have discovered that this exists."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come here for a while, so glad I made it on a sunny weekend as they have a huge patio sitting area in front of the store. 

I ordered an americano misto and a flare white for the Mr. and both were brilliant!!  Bold taste and full of flavour. Call me girly but I love the seeing beautiful designs on milk froths and the leaf on my americano was indeed beautiful.  We also got a chocolate chip sea salt Cookie to share because it's massive but after the first bite, I no longer want to share. It was super moist with crunchy edges (my favourite part) with the perfect balance of sweetness and saltiness. 

Te Aro is definitely going on my top 10 of cafes."}
{"text":"great coffee, they make a really good espresso. lots of seating. while their cookie was good, the gluten free olive oil muffin seemed to have too much orange rind making it bitter. i am not sure if bitter food goes well with coffee."}
{"text":"Pretty darn spectacular! 

I'm not going to lie, I don't LOVE coffee. But an amazing roaster in Tucson called Savaya has got me on the coffee train and I don't want to get off. When you pop into this place tucked a little bit off Queen East, an amazing roaster smacks you in the face. Well not literally, that would be a horrible business model, but pushed towards the back of the space is the beaut that I imagine they fire up after hours. It's pretty sexy for a piece of machinery. Coffee is well crafted, there are a plethora of tea options and the staff is super helpful and super informative. Not one of them scoffed at me when I asked for lactose free milk in my cappuccino. (Which was one of the best I've had btw, including sippers I've downed in Italy where I feel like cappuccino tastes like magic.) 

Pastry kicks butt too! I don't think they make everything, in fact I remember seeing a sign on the case for the place that crafts these little numbers. Wish I could remember, but suffice it to say the brownie and cookie I tried were worth the calories. 

I do wish they were open longer, but I imagine that's sort of a demand thing. If you build it, they will come. So if your thirsty Leslieville, perhaps they'll stay open. Looks like they do a cupping class on Tuesday night, although my schedule didn't allow me to try that out."}
{"text":"I live in the 'hood now and fell in love. It's about time I updated my previous review since I'm pretty much here every day. 

The flat whites are delicious. Croissants are pretty good too. I wish they had more savory options (Bobette and Belle nearby has a ham and cheese one, mm). 

This place is awesome. Since I moved I only got one bad bevy after coming here dozens of times. My favourite cafe in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, great atmosphere. Good service.

Terrible place if you need your laptop. I plugged into their only working outlet and sparks flew. Fair enough i suppose, they don't want people loitering around for hours but I walked in and my laptop had 1%. poor planning on my part but 1-2 working outlets would be nice."}
{"text":"The coffee at Te Aro is excellent. They do a very, very good flat white. There are plenty of wooden benches and tables, and the space is airy and pleasant. It's a spot well worth seeking out."}
{"text":"Had an iced latte here yesterday and grabbed a pear green tea for a friend.  While waiting to place my order, some spandex wearing hellcat bum rushed right in front of me.  She was literally hanging off the counter like a fiend.  We've all been in a desperate way for a coffee, but seriously?  The dude at the cash saw this and ignored her as it was my turn.  She turned around, gave me stank eye and said \"Oh are you next?\" Yes b$tch.  It's called a line, I thought but icily retorted \"Uh, yes\".  The dude at the cash was much more patient than me because at this moment I was ready to throw down.  He continued to ignore her and served me, slowly and pleasantly while she seethed.

Then picking up my beverages to bring them out to the patio, some jerk ran right into me and didn't apologize.  Fortunately, I was on high alert after the hellcat so my reflexes were sharp; I didn't drop the coffee or tea.  

Conclusion, this could be an isolated event.  The coffee is damn good, but I need to investigate the clientele further to know if I can stomach sitting down to enjoy said coffee in their midst."}
{"text":"Nice modern loft-like interior that suits my personal interior design style, delicious Americanos and lates. Cool coffee roaster.

Not giving 5-stars because the service is not consistent and their drip coffee tastes stale. They do however offer french press which is nice."}
{"text":"In another search for the best coffee in Toronto, I stepped here because the other shop just east along Queen was overly packed.  I will say this is a far more open, welcoming, and interesting spot to sit and enjoy a few coffees.  Te Aro serves Pilot roaster coffees in addition to many great tea blend latte.  Get all... really.  Just a wonderful place to enjoy on an afternoon.  

I arrived on a Saturday mid afternoon to find this place full but not packed.  There are many tables of varying heights and sizes that allow you to enjoy a cup quickly or sit and take advantage of the free wifi.  I love how the tables are really nicely placed and you're not sitting on someone's lap.  The front area is a HUGE window that looks like it retracts in the summer.  I can imagine this being fantastic for the summer time.

I asked for a chai latte with almond milk and a london fog one too.  It came smiling, quickly, and no attitude.  What a nice change from a terrible experience earlier in the day (aka.  Avoid Sorry coffee in Yorkville).  The barista made them quickly within a few minutes and I had in my hand two amazing lattes.  The chai latte had a healthy dose of cinnamon and was not overly sweet.  It allowed the tea blend to show ... I honestly think this is one of the better ones I've had in Toronto.  Next time I'm here, I'm grabbing an espresso drink.

Overall, great spot to enjoy a good cup and not feel crowded.  It has a great energetic vibe and yet it's relaxed."}

{"text":"Amazing latte, charming staff and a fantastic patio. This place looks much more pretentious than it is, people were comfortable working on laptops, meeting friends and reading here. A coffee shop worth travelling across town for."}
{"text":"Here's my ranking so far
My rankings:
1. Intelligentisia, Sam James, Te Aro (soy latte)
2. TAN (soy latte)
3. Crema  (soy latte)
4. Mascot (soy latte)
5. Bisogno Espresso Bar (soy latte)
6. Tampered Press (chai latte) 

Sometimes its difficult to describe why I like certain coffee shop over others.  Today, we visited Te Aro and thought it was delish!  It was just the right amount of espresso to steam soy milk ration.  Absolutely loved it.  My bf was shocked when I said that I liked it as much as Intelligentsia and Sam James.  I don't exactly know what it was but I couldn't put my coffee mug down!  Yum yum."}
{"text":"My new Fav. Coffee spot. Great space, great coffee and fast WiFi. Wish I had discovered it earlier than I did."}
{"text":"Te Aro is serious about their caffeine. It's obvious that all the baristas are super passionate and knowledgeable about coffee. Before Te Aro, I didn't really know what a good shot of espresso was supposed to taste like. Now I know. Not only do they serve a really great cup of coffee, they also offer barista training courses (not just for baristas, wannabe baristas and coffee enthusiasts also welcomed!) as well as public coffee cuppings and brewing method demos. 

I recently took the Level 1 barista training out of pure interest, and learned a lot about extraction, grinding, dosing, etc. There's also lots of opportunities for hands-on practice - I made about 5 sad-looking (but delicious!) lattes and drank probably 5 shots of espresso in the course of 2 hours. Needless to say, I was really buzzed that night. Buzzed from caffeine or buzzed from the thrill of learning about coffee? I would say a combination of both.

The cafe can get quite busy during the day, but there's a great vibe about this place. There are also lots of coffee beans and paraphernalia for sale, but I would say get your grinders and presses elsewhere - prices here are a little bit steep. Free wifi always AND free street parking on Queen on Sundays!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the atmosphere and the vibe at Te Aro. 

The inside is perfectly lit with warm and inviting lighting... It have to be one of the most quiet coffee place I been to, seems like everyone are whisphering in here... I love that communal table with the bar stool... even if you do come alone, feels like you are not alone sharing some spaces with others...

The staffs here are all nice and cheery. The brew is a little stronger than the other places I been to for the Cappuncino I ordered but love the latte art. So pretty to look at....and of course served in the proper glassware +0.5 star

Te Aro's patio is nice and inviting.. (I luck out.. no little ones or toddlers on this cool fall day.. but plenty of furry friends - the water bowels for doggie is a nice touch). It feels like an Oasis and a resort up North in the middle of TO.

Free WIFI always and extra +0.5 star!!

Used my Indie Coffee Passport here!"}
{"text":"This place is tucked inside Queen Street, which makes a great space out front for a patio. Seems like it'd be a great spot to work or meet up with friends - great ambiance and excellent service.

Sadly, the coffee was not great (I ordered an Iced Americano) - the roast was not super flavourful and it left a weird aftertaste. My opinion seems to differ from most other reviews here so it could have been an outlier..."}
{"text":"My friend and I have a nice-weather-on-Sunday plan, and I'll let you in on it:

Te Aro

I always get an Americano; he gets a latte.  Sometimes we split a cookie or a scone, and I try to time it right and nab the last bite as he's fiddling with his phone to get a great snap of the foam art on top of his drink.  Barristas = artists, y'all.

Warmer months?  Outdoors for a prime people watching patio spot.  
Cooler months?  Indoors at the long communal wood table (5/5 on decor, including the large garage door that brings the outside in).  

WE'Z GOTS OUR RITUAL DOWN PAT.  And, chased with a stroll around Leslieville...wouldn't change a thing.  

Yelp note: all you work-from-home-ers and freelancers: it's a great weekday place to tackle some work, too."}
{"text":"Te Aro owners Jesse & Andy are lovely people - both impossibly gorgeous, friendly in a small-town-neighbourhood kinda way and they've created a lovely space out of a former autoshop. Te Aro in the summertime is especially wonderful thanks to the large rollup garage-style windows, street facing patios (one of Leslieville's best) and ample seating both inside and out. 

I very much enjoy the drinks I've had here - drinks made with in-house beans are great and a double shot cappuccino is only $3.24 with tax. They have a rotating daily brewed iced tea with leaves from nearby Steeped & Infused and nice lemonades and juices. Universally adored baked goods from Circles & Squares can be found here.

The wi-fi is free and easy to use - lots of people come here to work or lounge with pals and I never feel rushed or unwelcome. Last time I came here John Frusciante's \"Shadows Collide With People\" was played in its entirety (!!) and the barista made my capp with latte art of a phoenix. There are always intriguing coffee lab experiments going on at the side counter, everyone seems to genuinely enjoy working here, and the atmosphere can't be beat! Also check out the beautiful artwork in the washrooms - I covet it.

FYI: There are a lot of stay at home moms and kids in strollers here, so if that's your demographic, you'll feel right at home. If that bothers you, this might not be your place, but there are always headphones (although then you'd be missing the killer music selections!)"}
{"text":"so this review is based on the fact that I am not a huge coffee drinker.
The reason Im not a big coffee drinker is that bitter taste. Oooo it smells so good, but often times that bitter taste kills it for me. Most of the time I have to put a lot of sugar to off set that and I may as well be drinking coffee icecream or coffee candy.

However, the best coffee I have ever tasted was in Costa Rica! Simple Cafe con leche. That strong coffee taste with no bitterness and warm milk no fancy foam. 
I thought I became a coffee drinker when I went there, thinking I will be drinking coffee from now on when I come back. Uhhh, no. Its not the same here unfortunately.

All of this to say - Im slowly trying to test out the coffee here based on reviews and add my own.

I like Te Aro's cafe Latte. Smooth - not bitter. It could do with a bit more stronger coffee taste. But I like the fact it is not bitter in the end and I can actually drink it without adding much sugar to it.

One thing I noted on the few occasions that I went there - no honey? Ive somehow acquired the taste of adding honey instead of sugar to my coffee. Supposively a more natural sugar. But oh well.

In this review I will also have to add my 2 cents to how their croissants are. As I have mentioned so far, nothing has compared to Cherry Bombs croissants. 
Unfortunately Te Aros will be added to the list of those that cannot compare. A coworker of mine told me Te Aro has great croissants so I had to try - I always head for the Almond one. 

Anyhow, my search goes on......"}
{"text":"About 6 weeks ago I concluded that responsible community members would voice their disappointment when they experience poor customer service. Te Aro was on my list and I gave the establishment a 1 star rating.

I couldn't be happier to return to this site today and change my rating to 4 Stars. The owner of the business personally reached out to me after she read the review, met with me, expressed her deep regrets and concerns about my experience, offered me a store voucher, thanked me for taking a position and making the time to meet, and committed to introduce my feedback into future staff training sessions. If I had to write the scenario of what I would like to see happen, I couldn't have written a better story.

Good for you, Jessie. This sense of ownership and accountability will always serve you well in a business to consumer environment. It will also contribute to the growth of your business. I look forward to returning to Te Aro for coffee starting from tomorrow.

{"text":"The last several months, I've fallen in love with Leslieville. Great brunch options, little little antique shops, unique boutiques offering local design clothing, and of course.... cafes!! I checked out Mercury, Bobbette & Bell. They just keep getting better =)

This place has something the others dont .... a SEXY patio!! The idea of sitting on a patio and sipping on a latte is so sexy.... I love it!! 

One eek, I thought the barista was a little too generous on the steamed milk which ended up covering the aroma of my coffee. But that was not a show stopper!! I still enjoyed it =)"}
{"text":"Call me a little biased because my girlfriend use to work here - but that means I actually spent a lot of time here. Honestly, the coffee is really good - especially love their cold brew (who knew cold coffee was a thing? I didn't). Service is super friendly, I remember hearing Andrew singing in there one day when pretty much everybody was gone - smiles all around :) Seriously, the people make this place, and it's THE cafe you should visit while in the area!

Oh yeh, the breakfast naps are awesome - worth the $!"}
{"text":"OHMYGOD they have the best mocha ever!! And their green + white pear tea was soooooooooooooooooooooo delicious and it smelt amaaazing. I'm having trouble deciding which is my favourite favourite beverage, but I think I'll go with the tea.

Their coffee was pretty nice too! 

I also adore their decor. I would prefer to sit inside just so I can admire the atmosphere. I love the dark colours and cozy feeling.

Strangers I met here are so sweet :) The baristas even sweeter. It's never empty here!"}
{"text":"Great coffee. Amazing outdoor space.  Wish I could come here more often -- maybe next time I'm in Toronto.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was shocked to see flat white on the menu, I haven't seen a flat white advertised in Toronto until now. 
I know it's a coffee that Australians are fond of and maybe the fact most of the staff are Australian influenced that. 
It was a brilliant flat white, very tasty and it have me that buzz you expect to get after drinking espresso.
My girlfriend got a latte and loved it.
I also got a cinnamon bun, it was amazing!
Very moist, warm and gooey. 
I can't complain about the service. Very quick and served with a smile. 
I'd definitely return and I would recommend it to coffee lovers."}
