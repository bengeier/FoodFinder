{"text":"Sometimes when a new business opens in Westmount I feel a little nervous for them, but I think Mandy's will do well. I like how Mandy's focuses on salads. Mandy's does it well and it fills you up like a well thought out salad should.   I had the Tokyo Salad and what stood out the most was the tofu and the dressing. Tofu is not easy to get right in a salad--at least in my experience anyways. The Tokyo salad was delicious and the ingredients were really fresh.   I was skeptical about the seating at first because it is such a small place, but since they serve the salad all in plastic containers, many people get it to go . The seating arrangement outside was just enough for those who wanted to stay.  Would definitely go back again and try other salads."}
{"text":"Best salads ever! Great portion size at a reasonable price. My husband had the \"man salad\" and it was even more amazing then my terrific \"wolf salad\". We will be back!!"}
{"text":"A true gem. Visiting from L.A. and this place is amazing. Clean, bright and welcoming. Staff super-friendly. Food was incredibly tasty and wholesome. We are here for dinner and then came back the next morning for breakfast and got the loaded avocado toast. Insane and filling. So good. This place is amazing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We regularly order Mandy's at work, and every single time, the order takes much longer than what we were told. Today, for instance, we ordered at 11:45 and didn't get our order until well past 2 o'clock because the kitchen is slow and they messed up the ord  If you can't keep up with demand, then you shouldn't offer delivery services.   The only good thing about Mandy's is that the salads are consistent. They need to find a way to make their kitchen more efficient though."}
{"text":"We came across Mandy's while walking through the streets of Old Montreal. It's a lovely airy space with black and white checkered floor tiles, white washed beams and family photos decorating the walls. Friendly staff greets you at the ordering counter and your meal is brought to your table. Want a delicious salad? Mandy's is the place! A wide variety of green salad bowls and rice bowls are offered. We loved Mandy's."}
{"text":"I love their original ingredients and appreciate the variety of their salads, however i find it hard to convince myself to pay $16 for a salad.. I only come here occasionally for that reason alone"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times now and to the one in Westmount at least 5-6 times and I just wanted to say that the one in Westmount gives you way more chunks of the delicious bits than the Laurier one. This makes me sad."}
{"text":"Mandy's is really delicious. They're not skimpy on the delicious items in every bite. It's very yummy but way, way too expensive."}
{"text":"Excellent salads and good smoothies. Their monthly specials tend to be especially good. They are generally very fast and accommodate special requests. Love the Mexican, the Curried Quinoa, and the Wolfe Bowl."}
{"text":"Horrible salad! I ordered an \"asian salad\" superdry. The noodles looked/tasted like the typical eggnoodles when they aren't cooked!!  Supposed to be plenty of vegetables in the salad. Basically just lettuce with raw noodles and a tasteless dressing.  They charge you 12 dollar for this crappy salad. Never again! Can not understand how it has so \"good reviews\""}
{"text":"Amazing salads. can set you back 15-20, Usually crowded, limited seating, but I suppose that's part of the charm."}
{"text":"Always fresh and satisfying! I always end up coming back to the asian salad! Perfect dressing and ingredients!! A bit too pricy to have it regularly. Maybe if you make your own salad, it'll be less pricy!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality, delicious, healthy, trendy.... Nice experience! We loved the place and are going back again tomorrow. It's one of those places that you have to try."}
{"text":"Total chaos !!  Don't waste your time or energy . It doesn't worth it !!  No manger in the branch !! This place was great when it was in Sherbrooke but I guess they will only go down from here as if they don't respect their customers and  don't care about their satisfaction and take it for granted. That's the first step downhill . Was a fan, not anymore ."}
{"text":"Very plain salad that lacks flavor. The lettuce was bitter. I gagged and couldn't even go through half of my salad.  All they did was chop the greens/fruits, throw them in a plastic cup, serve it in a hip tiny place and expect a tip on a takeout crazy expensive salad. I'm guessing in some people's book this is deserving of the price they are charging.  I've tried salad places elsewhere where they are bursting with flavor and cheaper. This chain is not one of them."}

{"text":"I'm not a salads person -- at least not for salads that are relatively still healthy for you. (I like my salads filled with croutons or seeds or fruits because deep down all I want to eat is carbs and fried foods all day).   So I was very happy to see that Mandy's had a great variety to choose from. Mandy's is actually perfect for the entire spectrum of salad eaters. They have salads that are 95% still healthy for you, salads meant for people like me who want a lot of taste and non-veggies (but who want to still feel like they're being healthy), and salads where it's probably more appropriate to call them \"salads\". (Smoked meat salad, really??)   If none of them hit the spot -- you can design your own. (But be careful as each addition costs $$ -- overheard a person comment that her \"build your own\" salad was $20!!) The cost is the underlying reason for my 3 star rating. Our salads were about $16 each (after taxes and a suggested tip that automatically comes up when you pay with card) and while the portions were generous, I still felt a bit peckish after.   Ultimately I didn't feel that my dinner experience felt worth that cost. The seating is cramped, there are no appetizers, and it's really more of a fast-food setting so you don't feel like you're completely unwinding. Personally, if I'm looking for a salad dinner, I would prefer to go to Aux Vivres for the more well-rounded menu and the more relaxed setting..."}
{"text":"What an experience my wife and I had. Great smells as you walk in. I had 'the man salad' and she had the kale something or other. They were both wonderful and we plan on going back Great business plan and we will recommend to others  Well done"}
{"text":"We had several salads. All were crunchy fresh and great tasting. A very healthy option. The staff were charming and helpfull. Highly recommended and we will be returning."}
{"text":"The salads were fresh snd very tasty, served in colourful bowls.The portions are very generous, i could only finish half of it. The airy and light interior matches the salads perfectly. Great choice for a hot summer day."}
{"text":"This place is Amazing! great salads, nice friendly atmosphere I am obsessed. Only little thing is that the lineup tends to be long (depending on the time you go) but definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I don't often go to the old port these days, but I was there last weekend with my cousin and we were looking for a light lunch. And then I remembered that Mandy's had opened a new location in the area (thanks, La Presse!). The location is kind of hidden; I think there's still some renovation on the street and the sign wasn't super visible either.  Once you get inside, you're hit with the wow factor of this place. It's really beautiful and photogenic. You can tell they've put a lot of thought into it. However, the salads are also worth it, in my opinion. I had the Habibi salad ($13.25). Filling and delicious. My cousin had the Tokyo salad ($12.75) and also enjoyed hers quite a bit. Attentive service. All in all, I had a really nice time here. But do expect to pay more than any other counter restaurant that serves salads."}
{"text":"My go-to salad is definitely the Reagan Danielle Extraordinaire. And let me tell you, it is extraordinaire!   I've tried a countless number of salads at Mandy's and not once did I dislike a salad. The portions are fairly big-- you'll definitely feel refuelled after finishing one of their salads.   The only downside is that it's waaaay overpriced. The cheapest you'll pay for a salad including tax and tip would probably be around $15. And you could also end up paying around $25 for another salad (ain't no shame in being delicious, Man salad).  This place is also always busy: crowded and packed, and lines all the way out to the terrace."}
{"text":"Mandy's is expensive but their salad bowls are huggeee. It takes me forever to finish it and fills me up so fast and makes me feel good. I love allllll of their salads especially the Tokyo salad. Everyone should try out Mandy's !!"}
{"text":"Absolutely great!  We wanted salad for lunch and Mandy's was perfect. Fresh ingredients. Generous portions. Amazingly diverse options; mix and add or take their standard menu offerings. Friendly, efficient staff. We shared a gigantic bowl of yummy barley and bean soup. My partner had \"super food salad\" to which he added some tofu protein. I had the \"salmon salad\" to which I added toasted walnuts and sesame seeds. YUM-MEE!!!"}
{"text":"Just ordered a salad, started eating it and found this bug inside. Most discusting thing ever. Dont go yhere"}
{"text":"Only giving it two stars because in theory it USUALLY tastes good if there's enough but not an overload of dressing/enough toppings. But beware...the base oil in ALL of the dressings is CANOLA oil...cheap and super unhealthy. For anyone going to Mandys because it's healthy.....stop....it's not. Make your own at home-- save your money and your health."}
{"text":"Looking for a fresh and hearty salad? Look no further than Mandy's. There are lots of lovely restaurants to choose from in Vieux Montreal, but as a tourist I found the green salad selections sparse. By my fourth day in the city, I'd had my fill of viennoises, smoked meat dishes and contemporary French cuisine--my body craved raw vegetables that were garden fresh. Mandy's didn't disappoint. The options are extensive and suitable for carnivores and vegetarians alike. Lovely \"shabby chic\" light-filled interior with friendly staff. Great beverage selection, and surprisingly the BEST latte that I'd had while visiting the city. (Even better than some highly recommended shops.) There are multiple locations, and I can completely see why!"}
{"text":"Big line but that is just a good sign that they're serving quality food that people love! Great interior decor and layout, really friendly staff (they stay calm and collective even during the lunch rush hour). Really diverse menu, anyone can find something there! Vegetarian and Vegan friendly!"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place; this salad place that is managed & owned by 2 sisters.  Once I saw their pink food truck in Vieux Montreal and then I decided to try their salad place.  There have a small terrasse, perfect for a sunny day. When you enter to order your salad you just feel hit by a retro mood. Design wise, the PLACE IS AMAZING ! The salads aren't that good. I will tell you why later on.  They have a small counter to order on the go, with fresh juices, fresh drinks , organic tea, small cookies...  The pineapple Wallpaper print, the frames on the wall, the design of the chairs and tables , the colors of the place, the chesterfield blue couches gives this restaurant a tropical and very calm and modern touch.  The outside terrace is very nice, they use french chairs that are very confortable, small fer forgé tables, they even have a small spot for dogs on sherbrooke street.  For what we ordered, their ready made salad , i was very disappointed, a salad at baton rouge is even better.  Tones of romaine lettuce, you can see the bowl, it is all green.  I had an asian salad , and my mom had a mexi salad. The only asian ingredient in the asian salad are the uncooked ramen noddles ( the ones you get for 1$ from the grocery store and boil them at home) and the sauce.  The mexi salad had the usual beens and corn and pieces of tortilla.  The concept of the 2 sisters is very creative and the design is at its top. The idea of having a salad place is also a great idea, giving the fact that everybody is on a diet these days.  But personally, I am disappointment of the salads. I do suggest they add more ingredient and get even more creative with the recipe. To watch out for the coming year for improvements!!"}
{"text":"A little pricy but sooo good! Salads are generous portions made with fresh ingredients and very tasty vinaigrette and between their interesting pre-made salads and their fully customizable options the choice is endless!"}
{"text":"I have to say upfront that I have never been a salad lover but I feel like Mandy's is one of those places that makes you feel like you're having a real meal and not just a salad. The place is very neat and trendy. It even has boxed water :O The selection is nice and the portions are very large. If you're not a big eater I would recommend sharing with a friend as they are willing to do 2 half bowls of the same salad.   I would just say the price of what they charge for these salads is a little extravagant. I like their food but I'm not sure I can justify paying up to $15 for some veggies and toppings.   Side note: they do have amazing fresh baked choco chip cookies."}
{"text":"Really delicious salads with very generous portions!  The staff is super friendly as well - the cashier noticed I was struggling with which salad (the choices all looked so good), and told me both a popular choice (Asian salad), and her own personal favorite (Wolfe bowl).   They're super accommodating as well - I ended up opting for the Asian salad (greens, tomatoes, avocado, sesame seeds, crispy noodles, shredded carrots, ...) , and they allowed me to sub rice noodles for the crispy noodles, and dried cranberries for carrots! You can also add protein or other things for an additional charge.   I think it is one of the best salads I've ever had - I really liked the creaminess from the avocados, and the dressing was very tasty as well. The portions are huge - it comes in a huge bowl (if you eat it there) - so it's super filling. Prices aren't bad either :)  You're also given the option of creating your own salads.  Long story short- lovely decor, friendly staff, super yummy salads, and generous portions.   Can't wait to come back to try their other salads!"}
{"text":"So this story actually starts over a year ago when someone brought a bunch of amazing salads to a potluck lunch that we had at work. I didn't think to ask where the salads were from, but I'd been on the look out ever since.  Fast forward to this week. I was looking for a healthy lunch downtown and I came across Mandy's on Yelp. As usual, I scrolled through the pictures on Yelp and perused their #JaimeMandys hashtag on Instagram. Lo and behold, I found the salad that I had been searching for!  I went at around 2 PM on a weekday and the place was still quite busy. The line up to order was about 5 deep, but it moved quickly. I ordered the Asian Salad to eat in and it was promptly delivered to my table. It was almost, but not quite, as good as I had remembered - possibly because I ordered mine only lightly dressed or because I'd been building it up in my mind for over a year... The portion size is perfect for me, but probably large by most people's standards =P  The place is vintage and bright and there is a variety of seating - communal tables in the centre, bar seating on one side, one or two tables with armchair (!) seats, and a few tables with bench and chair seating. There's also a decent sized terrace.  Overall, I'm a fan =)"}
{"text":"A beautiful place with exceptional food. I can honestly say one of best custom salads (options are incredible) I have ever had. All of the ingredients are extremely fresh and bursting with flavor and the people who work here are extremely friendly! An amazing experience around."}
{"text":"Really cute restaurant with chic minimalist aesthetics decorating the entire space. Friendly and fast service. Good food too! We ordered the Asian Salad ($10.49) and the Tokyo Salad ($12.75) and would definitely get them again. Both salads were very tasty and filling. The smoothies were tasty too."}
{"text":"Not a frequent salad eater myself, but tried this place with a few friends.  I didn't find the salads to be particularly different.  They are given fancy names and prices reflect this. $15 for a salad and you don't even get a place to sit.  They toss the salad when you order, but there is no customization involved. They also use plastic containers and bags which is not very environmentally friendly.  Will not return."}
{"text":"I discovered this place last summer and it definitely deserve a review. I am naturally a meat eater but I loved my experienced over there. Their mix of salads are just all very nice. I was with my girlfriend and we both tired a different meal. Both were very very good!!"}
{"text":"I had the protein bowl and thought it was really great. And they are environmentally conscious which is really cool!"}
{"text":"Finally a lunch resto downtown that does more than burgers and beer (love burgers and beer but not everyday) Mandy's has been a Montreal original staple for years. First in Westmount and Outremont and now here!!  The new location is beautiful and the salads are amazing. The Asian Salad and the Wolfe bowl are my two top picks. Mind you they are featuring a Lobster salad this month..."}
{"text":"Restons honnête ca la fout mal pour un homme de dire qu'il est fan d'un snack à salades... donc disons que j'ai découvert le Mandy's grâce à ma blonde (en plus c'est vrai), mais je la remercie (même si à chaque fois qu'on n'y va elle ne peut pas s'empêcher de voler un peu dans mon bol)  Le Mandy's surfe à la perfection sur la vague bio/healthy du moment.. mais avec le goût et le bon assaisonnement en plus !  Témoignage masculin à l'appui (d'un ami) : \"Mandy's m'a réconcilié avec les salades.\"  C'est un peu cher mais si tu es en ville, que tu veux manger sainement, veggie (ou non) et rapidement : à vos marques, prêt, saladier !"}
{"text":"Amazing place to check out if you love eating salads with a gold fork in a chic & fun environment. If your looking for a cool Instagram photo, this is the place to come. I think everyone (including myself) had their phones out taking photos of their meals & the store itself. Its just too cute!  I ordered \"the fave\" and the hubby had the lumberjack salad. While mine was light and tasty, I preferred his garlic-y dressing to my lime vinaigrette.   Ordering can be a tad slow at the cash if you get stuck behind the wrong people, but once ordering, service is pretty quick, and we must have had our salads at least 5 minutes after ordering our meals.   Will be back next time that I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"Had the family in here for dinner. Super fresh ingredients and interesting, original choices.   I ordered the Seoul Bowl, which was very tasty and original. I really liked the sauce that came with it. It took a good taste and took it over the top. I'd highly recommend.  My wife had the Mexican salad, which I'd also recommend. The romaine lettuce in this dish was very tasty, and I liked the cilantro/cumin vinaigrette dressing that came with it.  The kids shared the lumberjack salad. To me, this one was seriously lacking in flavor. There just wasn't anything there that differentiates it from any other chain restaurant's salad. The Caesar dressing didn't do much for it, and it simply lacked a lot of flavor.  But, overall, we had a great experience in a very pleasant environment. Additionally, the employees were very helpful and present. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Fresh & delicious. Yet! Pricey.   Mandy's has become quite popular with a few locations throughout the city.  With my first visit at the Westmount location. I was not as pleased as I thought I would be.  With it's popularity, the location is small and felt very crowded(At 1:30pm on a Tuesday)  While standing in line, often people asked for me to move and excused themselves for pushing. Where shall I move? There's not much space.  When ordering my salad, simply a Caesar without meat. I waited five minutes. Not bad! Yet, I had no choice but to go outside and wait there. The staff was disorganized and kept yelling names for people to pick-up their salads. Not a pleasant environment to eat at, while the staff screams.   Once my salad was prepared, I was lucky to find the one, and only table available. Which was very wobbly.  I must admit, the salad was tender, cold, crispy, and fresh. Wonderful amounts of real bacon, Parmesan shavings and a outstanding creamy house made dressing. The salad does contain capers. Don't be turn off by them. They add a delicious tangy taste.  Having said all this. Is it worth it $14.95? Without any drinks or meat. Absolutely not! Toppings, and meat are extra. They range from $3.00-$8.00.  If you're able and willing to spend $14 or more for a small bowl of salad. Go for it!  I'm in the search of other places with more logical prices.  Food should be priced for the value. This salad was not a good value.  Sorry Mandy's. Lower your prices, and I will be more than glad to return!"}
{"text":"Second time I come here and I've been dying to come back ever since the first! This location seems to be under construction so it's very small with like two tables so I would recommend it solely for pick up at the moment. It had a Wide selection of salads all with exotic ingredients. I got the Asian salad again and loved it just as much as the first time. I LOVE the Asian sesame dressing!!! I have never had mandarins in my salad and I absolutely loved it. The crispy ramen noodles make this salad even better if you like a bit of carbs inside. It's a healthy, filling and 'feel-good after your meal' experience!   -K"}
{"text":"Homemade salads in a girly setting -- I think the big draw of the place is that they make their own dressings. You find it by walking through Mimi & Coco's clothing store as it's annexed to the back of the store.   Choose from one of their many set salads or mix and match on your own.   We opted for the Raegan-Danielle Extraordinaire @ $10.99 / bowl. Portions are large and can easily feed two hungry people.   This was a wonderful salad - romaine lettuce, strawberries, carrots, avocados, baked pita chips with their yummy balsamic vinaigrette.  It was tasty and the dressing wasn't too overwhelming.   Why no 4 stars? The salad came pretty \"lukewarm\" in temperature. I like my salads on the cold side. Also, service could be friendlier - salads were served with a hastily plop on the table even though there weren't many people.   Small unisex bathroom in the back. Is this is must try? Only if you're in the area and hankering for some greens."}
{"text":"Best salad ever at an insane price. That's basically the summary of Mandys.  We came here for a quick lunch, and took forever to order because there were SO many options to pick from. We ordered the Fave salad, the Miso rice bowl, and the banana-nutella smoothie to share, and were ASTOUNDED by the $45 bill (tax/tip in).   That being said, everything was super delicious, and portion sizes were very generous.  Would I come back? Maybe...but the prices are a little bit of a turn off to be honest. Overall, great food and great service but crazy prices for what you get!"}
{"text":"Hidden away at the back of a clothing store on Laurier, this Mandy's offers all the deliciousness of all the other locations in the city. With a cute little seating area, it's the perfect place to grab a quick healthy bite while shopping in the area. Honestly nothing bad to say (except that I wish prices were more reasonable - $19 for a salad with some form of protein is a bit excessive). If it weren't for the steep price tag of a lunch salad, I'd eat here so much more frequently! Overall delicious salads, great service, and a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service rapide et la salade est à tomber par terre. J'adore, je kiffe.  Petite astuce, il vaut mieux commander en avance, cela permet d'éviter les longues files d'attentes, longues, mais service  tout de même rapide. À date, la décembre me ravit, petite salade verte avec morceaux de poires, noix etc...quand je dis petite, la jarre de transport est assez suffisante vous en aurez pour votre argent. La déco, si on y jette un rapide coup d'oeil est aussi très sympa et agréable. Essayez! =)"}
{"text":"I read on a foodie's blog that Mandy's was going to open a salad bar in the heart of downtown, so one evening after work, I took the time to visit.  The Mandy's counter is located right on Square Phillips, opposite the La Baie, for those who do not know the area. The concept is perfectly adapted to the rhythm of the neighborhood since it is fast, a simple paper form to fill or a selection of salads to choose from and 15 minutes later you're ready to go.  I ordered my favorite: the Asian salad, which is made up of Asian sesame vinaigrette. Romaine lettuce, mixed greens, avocado, crunchy noodles, mandarin oranges and cherry tomatoes with a cookie and a kombucha juice. Everything was tasty!  For this address, they have maintained the Californian atmosphere but the counter theme was added: there is almost no seating, some small stools and that's it.  An additional address where you can eat healthy while enjoying a nice terrace in the heart of downtown? ..... I'm here for it and I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Really great salad combinations. I love that you can add all sorts of proteins and sub anything in or out of the salads."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!! greatest salad ever. You got many choices and they are all good. I like to be surprised by their monthly salad. They opened a new mandy's on crescent too."}
{"text":"Wow wow wt re-wow ! Un 5 bien merité pour ce restaurant ! Honnetement dans la vie je ne peu pas dire que je suis un grand fan de salade et au Mandys j'ai mangé ma salade comme si c'etait la meilleure poutine du monde !  Vous devez essayer cette petite place , vous allez adorer je vous le promet !   En plus le resto est juste trop beau ! Aller prendre juste une limonade et vous allez triper !"}
{"text":"Awesome location and beautiful decor. The salads are huge, so come hungry. Nice wine selection. I was on business by myself, and this place was so comfortable and the service wad awesome (and English speaking)."}
{"text":"I placed an order from Mandy's this evening through Foodora, with a listed delivery time of 25 minutes.  Over an hour later, I find that the delivery tracking page hasn't even updated - not even once, it's still sitting there on \"Your order has been received.\"  I finally get through to someone on the Foodora customer service and they phone into the restaurant to find that the \"kitchen closed early\", so I've literally been sitting here 70 minutes while they didn't even bother to make my order.  No contact from the restaurant, no contact from Foodora, and given that I was paying $60 for 2 salads, there's *zero* chance I'm giving this place a try at their physical location. If you're not going to fulfill orders, don't sign up with a delivery service. Complete waste of time and thanks for ruining our dinner."}
{"text":"There's some sort of sorcery going on here. It's the only explanation for how they make salads taste this good!  This is like going to a candy shop for healthy eaters- yet it still somehow feels like an indulgence. To be fair, some of their pre-designed salads are pretty naughty but, with that said, how healthy (or not) your meal ends up being is entirely up to you.  Their portions are enormous and, unless you're really starving, are hard to finish in one go. I'm personally not the biggest fan of their soups, but I like that they come in more reasonable size options and are entirely customizable.   The featured decor at each shop is very ~on trend~ and the vibes are always good! But honestly, you'll probably be too wrapped up in your healthy high to notice."}
{"text":"I was pretty surprised with the salad I ordered today. It was actually delicious. The salad was simple, fresh and it was a healthy alternative. It's great if you are vegan, on a diet or eat healthy.  The price is very good considering the huge portion that we get. I wouldn't eat this for dinner, but it's a perfect size for a lunch. My sister ordered Asian salad and I took the Tokyo salad. Both were vegetarian and it were tasty, fresh and delicious.  I would go back again."}
{"text":"I've only been to the Mandy's on St. Catherine but this was a different level of cute, meets salad bar. It reminded me a lot of a breakfast at Tiffany's kind of feel. I felt underdressed! The  menu at first isn't obvious since it's not listed in the back. I had to ask the server who handed us a menu. There was a variety of soups and salads. The wild sage salad was so good with goat cheese, figs, sweet potatoes as some of the ingredient. The price is not cheap but totally worth it for the environment. I still can't get over the fresh flowers. Such a cute date spot!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating horribly lately. All this meat and fat and dairy and carbs has been doing a number on my belly and my overall energy. I need a break. Heard about this salad spot Mandy's near my therapist, and decided to check it out after my most recent session. I mean, what better way to recover from an hour of mental work than by filling yourself up with some roughage? The place is set up super nice. There's a white picket fence bordering the sidewalk terrace (which I'm sure will be coming down as the impending snow gets closer). Thankfully, the interior is nice and bright, with well thought-out decor to make even the grumpiest therapy patient crack a smile. Ordered the \"Superfood\" salad: kale, spinach, mint, pomegranate, apples, avo, broccoli, tomatoes, quinoa with a house vinaigrette. Probably could've done without the tomatoes and broccoli but I'm not complaining too much. My body better reward me with some smooth poo tonight. Also tried out the classic \"bulletproof\" coffee, which has ghee, coconut oil, honey, and cinnamon. Delicious! The staff were super cool and overall we had a nice, albeit quick experience."}
{"text":"Great place for original salads. I love the asian dressing and its available for purchase by the bottle. You get the option to make your own salad which I adore. By the way try their chocolate chip cookies they are AMAZING! Best place for healthy \"fast food\"."}
{"text":"Recommended by our horse carriage guide, we stopped at Mandy's for salad lunch. It was very busy and we decided to take away. The salad was fresh and tasty, but a salad is a salad... The shop had a very nice decor and their outdoor seating area was very cute. Wish I could have had it there, maybe it would make the salad taste better."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong I usually LOVE Mandy's and it's kind of a treat for me or a great end to a shitty day lol But sometimes they can be a little inconsistent with the ingredient ratio and dressing. However, tonight was so disappointing! The parmesan really makes a difference and there was barely any at all. The real dealbreaker: the dressing. Not the usually yummy flavor, in fact, it was bland, VERY oily (it's usually creamy) and dry (not enough dressing?). I would put a 3.5 star but if you're going to charge 16$ for a take-out salad it better be on point. Sorry guys :/"}
{"text":"Good salad. Long waits. Fair price (still wish it was 15% less). Nothing unexpected, which can nice, but Panthère Verte's salads one block over have some mind blowing flavor."}
{"text":"Pour se réconcilier avec les salades, c'est définitivement l'endroit"}
{"text":"Well the construction mentioned in previous reviews is over and now there's seating outside on the sidewalk as well as inside. Great hearty healthy salads and a good vibe atmosphere. You order at the counter and they call your name when your order is ready in a few minutes. Fast Food you can feel really good about"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time last night, and it was really good! The service was fast, the waitresses were really friendly, and the atmosphere in general was really calming. I tried their Wolfe bowl and it was incredibly flavourful and full of textures, it was with a creamy dressing, arugula and some other greens, sunflower seeds, brown rice (I'm sure there were other stuff in there too but I'm just trying to make a point that there were variable textures). The bowl is HUGE, and I couldn't finish it (probably that churros I had before lol). One thing though, the flavours were amazing, but I feel like if you eat slow like me, you start getting bored of the taste (especially it was heavy and creamy like my dressing). I'm hoping at least some people relate to that, I get bored of foods halfway through a lot  I would definitely go again though, to try another salad (perhaps with a lighter sauce this time)."}
{"text":"Súper delicioso, las sopas y ensaladas estaban geniales. Además la atención al cliente es súper agradable"}
{"text":"Very good salads, generous portions. I either get the Mexican or Asian, I can't break away from those two!"}
{"text":"Mandy's Gourmet Salad is the nirvana of salads in Montreal. First of all, you can customize your salad and nobody will make you feel bad about it. In fact, they encourage it. Maybe, that's how they get new ideas? Great place to meet people."}
{"text":"Beautiful, summer looking restaurant! White walls! Plants and flowers all around. Mandy's is known for their salad. My sister and I went there for lunch. There are two line ups. 1) order your dish, pay and take your number to your table, food will arrive when ready; 2) you can order by telephone, and pick and pay at this line.   We got the The Santorini Salad and the \"Fave\" Salad. Both were absolutely delicious!   The service is good.  The place is beautiful. The food is super succulent. Price is super high; and it's painful.  Still highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is more of a pickup location cuz there are very few places to sit down but the food is unreal. I would eat this every single day if i could!"}
{"text":"Seriously, they must secretly put crack or some other addictive substance in their salads, because once you have one, you'll want one all the time.  My personal favourite at the moment is the Wild Sage.  They're not cheap, but with top quality fresh ingredients, you get what you pay for.  Since their recent expansion there is much more seating but it can still be hard to get a table from about 11:30-1:00 sometimes.  There is often a bit of a wait to place your order and get served, but this is mainly due to their popularity than problems with the staff, they do their best to keep up.  They also have smoothies in the summer, which I find just ok, and soups in the winter which are super yummy.  I wish they offered two size options as I find their regular size often a little big (yet somehow magically manage to stuff it all in) or a soup and salad combo would be really nice.  You can split with someone and they will put the salad into two containers for you if you ask."}
{"text":"The salads were delicious and filling! The store and the patio was so quaint too. The people working were very friendly as well. I loved this little salad shop!"}
{"text":"4.80$ plus tax for an 8oz of so called Latte ... made using a capsule coffee machine ... all of which is drowned in too much milk. Horrible ratio."}
{"text":"The salad's are great here! The staff is nice and the place is beautiful. My only complaint is that they are a bit expensive"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but I was very happy with my salad. You start off with a long list of items and you basically build your own salad by ticking the square boxes coinciding with what you want. I ordered a salad with romaine lettuce, black bean, blue cheese, walnut and avocado  with a cilantro-cumin vinaigrette. It came in a gigantic bowl and was absolutely delicious. I also ordered a small thai soup which I immediately regretted. First of all because the salad was enough food on it's own and second of all because the soup was just terrible. It was watery, salty and the vegetables were bland.   Also, I don't love the atmosphere. The decor is generally tasteful but the tables and seats are arranged cafeteria style which for me isn't ideal. You might be forced to sit next to a stranger, which I don't really like. My friend and I grabbed one of the only couch/table scenario but we had to lean way over to talk because it was a little loud and the couches are far apart.   I'm giving it 4 stars because I think if you ordered your own personalized salad to go and avoided the thai soup, you'd probably be very satisfied. It's always nice to have healthy meal options downtown Montreal."}
{"text":"Great hearty salads. Have tried a few different ones all delicious and most can be altered to be GF!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Mandy's yet!! This place lives up the hype.  Mandy's is the reigning salad queen.   Before this place, I always hardcore judged people who ordered salads in restaurants. I mean, why would I pay to order something that I could easily make on my own? But then I finally gave in and decided to give Mandy's a shot. Best decision ever.   I've gotten takeout from here and also dined in. Both experiences have been good! If you're eating in, there are some tasty hot sauces on the table!   I always go for the Fave or the Wolfe bowl. I try to branch out every once in a while, but always end up going back to my #holygrail salads.   The lineup for ordering can be long, but don't worry: it moves fast.   I have literally eaten there like 15 times (no exaggeration) and every time has been a lovely experience. 10/10 recommend. One of my favorite spots in Montreal."}
{"text":"Trendy little boutique in the quaint shopping area on Avenue Laurier.   In the back of the shop is this this great little salad bar serving chopped salads and delicious cookies.  Great lunch spot after a long morning walk."}
{"text":"Expensive, but good. You can have your salad tailor made so it meets your ridiculous diet requirements. It is hard for me to find a place that is able to fulfill the needs of my diet - and Mandy's certainly did just that. Eating there is nice too and the shabby-chic ambiance makes me want to be healthy and eat more salad."}
{"text":"So, Mandy's has always been my go-to \"salad\" place when I'm craving greens, and this time was no exception. I usually order a Cobb salad, which is delicious, but this time I grabbed the Wolfe Bowl, an amazing mix of greens, nuts, rice and the amazing tamari sauce. It was a delicious blow of freshness during this cold winter evening.  It's kinda pricey, but the free carbonated water kinda makes up for the fact that you are paying 15$ for a salad."}
{"text":"Usually when I come here it's at the insistence of my wife - who loves it.  I find the best way to eat here to call in your order rather than walking up to the counter because it's always busy. That being said they are typically fast nonetheless (last time it was a five minute wait when I didn't order ahead which I considered pretty good).  The food is generally pricy, but I've not met a bad salad from there yet.  The portions are large - personally I would rather a half portion from there myself...   if you like salads, this is a good place to try. Since their renovation/ expansion you can sit inside a bit easier."}
{"text":"Nothing much was open on Good Friday and ended up here. I thought to myself just another salad place. Holy shit was I wrong. This was the best and freshest salad I've ever had.  Roasted walnuts dipped in maple syrup, apples, ham, dried cranberries. What a combo. Tried the salmon salad as well. Fresh dill, asparagus, pine nuts, quinoa.... Wow!  Now I know why there was a line up out the door. Very busy for take out. 2 big community tables. Friendly staff. I'll be back! Bravo Mandy's, you brought salad to the next level."}
{"text":"First off, be ready to pay for a snobby, overhyped, okay-ish $15-$20 salad. I'm the type of foodie that will pay whatever the amount for good food, but I dont agree paying for a $20 salad that isn't out of this world.   First time I went I got a Wolfe Bowl Salad and I was soooooo disappointed. Cashier said it was the most popular salad but I beg to differ. The Tameri dressing was so over powering and literally everything was drenched in salad dressing. Im a sauce person so Im all about it but this one was just so wrong. I dont understand why arugula and kale would be paired together, the taste of the two together was so bitter I barely touched the salad. This salad tasted very grainy and my teeth and jaw were so tired of chewing all the hard brown rice that was in it. DId not like it at all  Second time I ordered a Mexican salad. Lettuce, black beans, tomatoes, torilla chips and a cilantro dressing. It was very basic and I would not be trying that one again. This time the kitchen barely put any dressing on so everything just tasted very bland and dry.   Third time I ordered a Miso Hungry salad. Lettuce, rice noodles, red peppers, edamame, miso dressing and avocado. dressing was light and flavorful, textures of the salad could have used a little more crunch. Overall it was a good salad but the KITCHEN FORGOT THE DAMN AVOCADOS!! At this point I had already returned to my office and it was too cold to go back. I was so angry, out of all the ingredients to forget they forget the best one!!!  If you want to eat healthy and feel very \"posh\" then Mandy's is your place. Overall, the salads are edible but I would much rather spend my $20 on a meal that's worth it."}
{"text":"I found Mandy's new location while I was going for a walk and it is so close to my work place. Im very happy for a healthy loving salad place nearby and not trying to junk around. It's amazing. Love the idea of fitting in Mandy's there as it's like an express service where they have wifi, places to eat. I love the whole concept. Their salads are still the best and affordable. The hostesses are friendly and very accommodating. Love this new place of colours around us and positive vibes. It's so cute."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a Laurier shop filled with pretty ladies buying pretty things, I never would have expected a place serving such delicious and copious salads. I had the Cobb salad and also tasted the Wolfe bowl, and both were excellent, and quite filling. About 15 different kinds to choose from, with 7 choices of protein to add. My only criticism is that I had to pay $3.50 extra to add grilled chicken, whereas it should be included in a Cobb salad, by definition."}
{"text":"Mandy's is always a good option! That about sums it up, but if one needs a bit more information they have some pretty tasty salads that will both fill and nourish you with they're variety of nuts, protein and veggies. This time I ordered the habibi salad with quinoa and chickpeas! Service is efficient and nice!"}
{"text":"Je suis allé à leur camion sur rue #bouffederue près du carré Places d'Armes. J'ai pris la salade wolfe et j'ai ADORÉ!!! C'est génial d'avoir des options santé sur la rue. En plus ils servent leurs salades dans un format facile à emporter et à manger. Well done."}
{"text":"Nutritious & tasty! Mandy's is more than just salads, it's a full brand. For my full review: https://therealmtlfoodie.wordpress.com/2018/06/18/mandys-salads-worth-the-hype/"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of salads in general, mainly because I am a big fan of meat. Naturally, I had the filet mignon salad, it was a gigantic bowl of arugula, baby spinach, and so much meat.... It was delicious~ The portion size was exceptionally large. I also liked how clean the place was, and service was nice too."}
{"text":"A small bank of tables plays peek-a-boo behind some stunning women's clothing. If you didn't know any better, you wouldn't know it was there to begin with. And then somehow in the moments between stepping in off the street and sitting down, you're swept away. I don't recall if music was actually playing but in my head there played a French song I had never consciously heard before. Mandys does this to you. Transcended.   We arrived for a late lunch and found ourselves to be the only two dining. The salad menu is extensive. Build your own or culinary masterpieces (if salad is allowed to be considered in the masterpiece category of course) ranged from meat forward to cheese forward and fruit in between. I picked a Man Salad. Plenty of meat including bacon, heaps of vegetables including avocado and a caesar/ranch dressing. I know, it doesn't sound like anything unbelievable when I utter the ingredients, but there's something about how this salad is made -- perhaps with love? It won my heart as I crunched all to greedily on perfectly proportioned -- hefty bowl -- of lettuce and veggies. If you come hungry, you'll leave satiated and feeling healthy! The bowls are truly meal sized.   And the sister owners? Well, their radiance beamed on all of the walls too! I sense they're going to be seeing me again!"}
{"text":"I hate leaving bad reviews but this branch is NOT dog friendly. We often love going out of our way to Mandy's as we can bring our little guy. On a hot day my first concern was to hydrate my fury friend. The manager 'Konstantinos' sees me looking around, 'is there a Dog bowl?' I ask he's directs me outside, there isn't one, I then have to ask a waitress who brings one out. He then comes to tell me that the dog water is for paying customers only. Really, what a joke. I then meet my friends and we place our order. He had plenty of time to apologize, instead I'm meet with embarrassed nervous glances from across the restaurant. Between myself and friends we easily spend around $500 a month here. Shame to be treated like this at one of my fav spots."}
{"text":"I'm so reluctant to eat here. I only have it when my family doesn't want to cook because it's so close to our house. I'm not the one that pays. Last last time I got a Tokyo salad and I didn't get tofu. I was wondering if this was one of those bullshit things where you pay an extra $2-$3 for chicken *rolls eyes* but no I checked the menu it's supposed to come with tofu.  They forgot the vest ingredient! The next two salads I got Tokyo salad then Asian Salad both were underdressed. Next time my parents want this I'm asking for the Dagwoods next door instead. THIS PLACE IS NOT WORTH IT!"}

{"text":"I don't understand how Mandy's been so popular for so long. I live around there and for years I've heard about it and \"how good it is\", but I never came around to buy a salad because I heard it was expensive. Finally, I tried a salad the other day and I can say that it was the most underwhelming experience ever. There really isn't anything amazing about these salads and they definitely aren't worth the money. My mom got the Asian salad and she said it was dry. You can easily make your own salad at home; it'll taste way better and save you a lot of money. On top of that, it's pretty packed inside and loud (I went around 1:30 so it was probably rush hour). It's not a nice atmosphere to sit down and enjoy a nice meal except if you're eating outside where it's a bit more quiet and less hectic. Although, the decor is really really nice and they have nice/cool drinks in the drink fridge. But yeah that's probably the only outstanding thing about this place. Anyways, I'm not saying their salads are bad I'm just saying they're waaaaayyyyy overrated and not worth the money."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Delightful place. Great ambiance. The salad was delicious. Terrific service. We had a couple of hours to burn before heading to the airport. They were completely comfortable with that in spite of it being a peak iMessage over lunch.   Clearly this place has a great reputation as it was very busy. Definitely a winner."}
{"text":"Order your salad from the app and you'll skip the waiting line and just go pick up your order. Be sure to note there's a 20 min process time so order before geting to the restaurant. Fresh produce, always a pleasure to make up my own creation."}
{"text":"Tasty fresh salads rich in flavour and ingredients that were great portions also. The service was great- they were informative and provided suggestions. Will eat here again!"}
{"text":"C'est vraiment bon,  mais le service est ordinaire et c'est excessivement cher pour ce que c'est... un endroit fancy, trendy, mais je ne crois pas que ça vaille la peine"}
{"text":"It's official, Salad is back on my Radar!  This place does one thing and one thing right... Salad. Wow. They have a fantastic selection of belly filling giant salads. And I mean GIANT! I used to think that a salad wasn't a dinner, well from Mandy's it is.   I highly recommend you give this place a try. Today!"}
{"text":"Concept très innovateur, et axé santé! sans la morosité! Les salades sont originales, avec une liberté de choix  de plusieurs ingrédients,  Le personnel a souvent le sourire et le service est efficace; parfois quelques erreurs on oublie tel ou tel ingrédient mais visiblement, très motivés pour ne  pas oublier une 2ème fois.  Propre, organisé, moderne. Certaines salades sont franchement délicieuses, bémol sur les prix parfois, mais dans l'ensemble vraiment bien, créatif."}
{"text":"My first time trying Mandy's, I am a  salad person so I thought this place is right up my street. Ordered the Wolfe salad and was very disappointed in the taste, no balance in flavors and very expensive for what it is. My friend ordered the Asian salad and said that other branches taste better."}
{"text":"Good salads, service was very friendly. The also have free carbonated water on tap which is nice :)"}
{"text":"Famous Mandy's salad that I had to try. Being not a big fan of salad to begin with, I was not impressed after going to this restaurant. However, I would understand why someone would be pleased with this place.  I went there for dinner. The environment of the restaurant was nice, with great hipster decors. The way you order you food is you go to the counter and choose your salad, then sit down and someone will come serve you your meal.   As for the food itself, I usually find salads more a chore to eat than anything else. I just feel I spend more energy chewing the salad than the nutritional gain that I get from it. This salad was no different. The flavors of the salad itself were more or less enjoyable. I found by half the bowl, I got very bored of eating it.  Overall, although I find the appeal of salads as a healthy alternative for meals, Mandy's has not changed my opinion on salads."}
{"text":"SO SO good! As salad places go, this one may be my favorite so far (and I've tried many). We ordered the Wild Sage & Superfood salads, both were amazing. Price wise, obviously not cheap (most are over $13), but definitely worth it. Several locations around MTL!"}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious, and addictive. Those three words accurately describe my experience with this salad joint - only complaint would be the insanely long lines during the lunch rush hour, but it's normal."}
{"text":"So  I'd suggest sticking with the menu. Protein is not worth the extra $$$ but the quality of greens and such is amaze"}
{"text":"Very busy, but well worth the 15 minute wait. One of the best and healthiest lunch places I've been too in quite some time. I had the October salad with chicken added."}
{"text":"Im  currently in a no process carbs  journey and I was kinda annoyed with life because well  I love to eat out...A friend of mine  told me about that place and I was yessssss  I wanna try it. I got awesome friends!I love Mandy's; my salad was fresh,the portions are huge and u definitly dont leave the place starving...the decor was pretty nice. Service its a bit grounded though we were at the Crescent location"}
{"text":"I'd really give it a 4.5 if that was a thing.  I visited on a weekday peak lunchtime hours (between noon-1pm) and the place was packed - all the seats inside were taken, almost all the outside terrace/patio seats were filled and the line was super long. Surprisingly enough though, the line moved very quickly and I was able to place my order in a minute or 2. Since I can be a picky eater with raw ingredients, I decided to customize my salad with - romaine lettuce, organic greens, blue cheese, feta cheese, avocado, rice noodles, sunflower seeds, and edamame along with a green dressing, which came to $12.49 +tax. The girl taking my order was very helpful and gave me 3 samples of dressings to try, since I had no idea what any of them tasted like, so if you're picky about your dressing and would like to try them out, they give you a small piece of lettuce with the dressing to taste and test out.  Even though the restaurant was incredibly busy, there were constantly salads in large ceramic bowls being brought out and I go my take-out salad too within 10 minutes. This place is pretty dog-friendly too, as I saw a customer bring her dog in as she placed her order. On the side, in a fridge beside the cashier/counter there are bowls of some of the premixed salads, fresh juices, and small mini salads. They also sell smoothies and some sweets (cookies, brownies, etc.) on the side.   I feel like the salads in the bowls are a little bigger than the take-out container ones, but even so, the take-out container ones are very large and filling, even mine without any protein. I did find that the majority of my avocado was at the top and all the edamame was the bottom, so it would have been nice if the salad was a little better mixed. There was also a bit too much dressing for my taste, so you can request for lights/less dressing when you order as well."}
{"text":"The Wolfe Bowl with extra grilled chicken is to die for.A little pricey but the complimentary carbonated water is good compensation"}
{"text":"Mandy's is my go to place for innovative generous gourmet salads. I automatically feel skinnier when I step into those doors. However If I'm being 100% honest, I often order the Cobb salad which I'm sure is their most caloric salad but what can I say , the heart want what it wants...which is Bacon in a salad. I also love the pieces of baked pita In it because it makes it so scrunchy. Their salad are on the pricy side but they are very generous so you at least stay full for a few hours after. There's not much room to sit at this location but I saw that there's a bigger location in old port that I haven't tried. Even if there's a lineup don't be scared to go in because they are very effective. I tried the October salad and the superfood salad, they were both really good.  Everything about Mandy's is well marketed. I love seeing local success stories. Being health conscious is in style, their decor reminds me of summer and California. Everything about this place is so \"Instagram pic ready\"  from their boxed water to their funky bowl.  I feel like you can't leave this place without a big smile on your face. Bravo Mandy's !"}
{"text":"I'm gonna talk about the ramen here today, but just to get it out of the way, the salads and other soups are excellent. I found the December salad in particular to be a nice surprise!  But, I'm more writing this review as Mandy's was part of my Ramen Rampage when I discovered that they now offer ramen noodles as a soup option ... effectively putting Mandy's on the NDG ramen map!  The nice thing about Mandy's is that the extreme level of customization means you get exactly what you ask for -- no more, no less. This isn't going to be your perfectly authentic Tampopo-level ramen experience, but when you need to eat some kale and carrots but you have a hankering for ramen, you need to come to Mandy's.  Build-your-own is the name of the game at Mandy's (okay they have suggested combos too) so just pick a broth (the vegetarian broth is on point!), get some ramen noodles in there, maybe add some protein, pick your veg, and your wish is Mandy's command. I got a boiled egg, mushrooms, and green onion for ramenniness in addition to the broccoli, carrot, and kale for health!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Warm and friendly staff at the counter, warm, bright and inviting restaurant.  I had a fabulous miso salad with ahi and walked out feeling good and satisfied. The 5 stars you yelpers have bestowed upon Mandy's is truly well earned.  It doesn't take much to sour my opinion and I've got nothing but praise for this joint.  If we were staying in Montreal longer Id be a frequent flyer here because it was that good."}
{"text":"I've spent quite a bit of time in Montreal recently, so I've been to Mandy's for lunch. Though it's pricey, it's the best place in the city to get a healthy meal. I've never ordered a menu item, but it all looks great! I enjoy customising my salads. Sometimes the staff messes up my order (lettuce instead of kale :() but they're always welcoming. The complimentary sparkling water is a treat too. I would highly recommend Mandy's to anyone looking for a healthy and tasty lunch around Concordia."}
{"text":"Great salads! We got the Wolfe Bol and a Caesar Salad. They were hearty salads that both myself and my girlfriend really enjoyed.   We wanted a light, but filling meal and Mandy's hit the nail on the head. Really deep bowls and the salads are coated fully with dressing.   Mandy's is a trendy and healthy eating spot. Everyone sat at big, family style table vibes, with trendy wall art and a big cooler to choose drinks at. It was the perfect meal for us. I highly recommend coming here for a healthy, good meal."}
{"text":"Congrats Mandys!  Very smart, groovy, busy business.    Salad done like never seen before. The 95%, mostly 20 something, estrogen-power packed house gathered in front of large bowls of greens plus. With boxes of water! A couple fellas joining. One adult fella sat at a communal table with red meat tossed on his greens and a steamy bowl of soup.   Salad that knows its worth. Not cheap: portions, nor price. Lots of choice. Create your own. Filtered H2O. Product. Clean. Lovingly designed.   Just smart. Healthy.   Awesome."}
{"text":"Their Asian salad is made of canned mandarins and  cheap ramen. You can taste the preservatives from the canned fruits. There was very little avocado. Overall, the taste was good.  But not worth the price."}
{"text":"Really great salad combinations. I've had the wolf and that Asian salad. Both were really exceptional, dressings are really rich and tasty. All of the ingredients taste fresh. I usually eat a lot and surprisingly, I'm full from one bowl of Mandy's. Each salad is in the range of $9 to $15 and you have the option to add meat, etc.   Highly recommend trying! Really great atmosphere, casual seating. Nice location right on Crescent, quits a bit of natural sunlight from the window. No need to tip and they have wifi. They have limited seating however."}
{"text":"This is where i like to get lunch on a weekday if i haven't brought my own to work. They have a nice variety of suggested salad mixes (endless summer and Cobb's are my favs) and you can choose to make your own. Portions are large and they mix in a little too much dressing for my taste - i always ask for half dressing. The atmosphere is pretty casual and cozy and the restaurant is bright with large green plants that are easy on the eye particularly in winter. I find the salads relatively overpriced (most are just below $20 after tax), specially b/c they don't use organic greens (they use free range eggs though)... Overall it's pleasant and relaxing to get lunch there and enjoy a midday break. Perhaps not economical for eveyday lunch, but good for a tiny treat every once in a while"}
{"text":"What a delightful place. Order your own salad (you chose the toppings) with a ton of choices In lettuces, meats, cheeses and veggies.  The ingredients were very fresh. My only complaint is that there isn't enough seating. If you go during lunch hour-Prepare to get it to go."}
{"text":"Mandy's proves you can make friends with salad. Meal-sized and then some. Fresh ingredients (and lots of 'em to choose from). No matter what regimen you're following, there's something for you here. But let's also be real for a hot minute: salads do not equal healthy if you're loading the blue cheese + candied pecans + cranberries + waterfall of dressing. (Then again, LIVE YOUR LIFE!)"}
{"text":"This was one of our go to places for a healthy, tasty meal. We have only eaten at this  location but I am sure the other sites are similar. There was certainly a lineup to order during lunch but well worth it. There is an option to order the themed Salads or you can build your own. I ordered the Tokyo Salad which I highly recommend. Prices range from $9-$12 for the salads and the portion as very big. It is has a great vibe to the place both inside and on the patio. We really enjoyed coming here for lunch and did come back more then once. Only recommendation would be for the Take out containers to be switched from Plastic to Paper. Let's be healthy to planet as well as our bodies."}
{"text":"Seeing a restaurant full of 20 something's eating $20 salads is quite strange.  I'm not going to say where my $20 would have gone when I was that age but it wouldn't have been on salad.  Lol.   That said, Mandy's really does make a great salad.   You can pick from a set list of salads or custom make your own.   I've had great results both ways."}
{"text":"The most interesting things in life are the pleasantly unexpected and Mandy's is definitely pleasantly unexpected! Located in the back of a clothing store, there is a magical salad making place! We've all seen salads, they come on the side of your plates, in a little bowl, and sometimes it even comes on a square dish which makes you think wow, that's a decent size salad. At Mandy's, you got eat your salad twice! Well at least I do.   It's been 4 visits to Mandy's so far, there are tables to sit at or you could have it to go, but they are literally the dream saladmakers. I say this because of the amount of fresh ingredients they have, and they are super accommodating when you want to change an ingredient.  So far I haven't been able to deviate away from the Man Salad, but I also thing that it's because I don't come here frequent enough and when I think of Mandy's now that's all I think of. I substitute the bacon for black beans, and like I said, relaxed and smiley staff that don't even think twice about it.  I think the only difficult part for me, is getting here at the right time, I find myself working all over Montreal, so sometimes I will be nearby when it closes or before it opens, but I heard they have delivery for that.   So YES, get off your butt and go to Mandy's, it's the treasure that's been waiting for you here in Montreal."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed! The space is incredibly rich with feminine, fresh design. They have a huge salad menu with unique combinations and healthy options. Favorite lunch in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Delicious salads and soup. (Pastries looked good also.) This place is doing the gourmet salad thing WELL. I ordered take out, but it looked like a great place to come sit with friends. I recommend the wild sage salad."}
{"text":"Looking to recharge with some greens, my wife located Mandy's courtesy of Yelp.   We tried two to share, the Wild Sage and the Asian. The Wild Sage is outstanding. Gave us some good ideas for future salads. The Asian is also very good, but more inline with other Asian salads we have had. Both salads had little items about them that made the salad more interesting - fried onion in Wild Sage and crumbled, dry ramen in the Asian.   Good selection of tasty beverages to accompany the salads.   We were there during rain, so unused outdoor seating made it a little crazy inside.   And as others have mentioned, it can be a little pricey. But when you are on a weekend of eating heavy food, the cleansing aspect may be worth the money."}
{"text":"Mandy's salads are great. Overpriced... but great. I assume the rent in Westmount must be high. It's fresh, the ingredients are top notch. This is not a burger joint salad.   My issue is with the wait time. If I call ahead to order a salad am they tell me it will take 20 minutes, I expect it to be no more than 5 minutes to pay and pick up my salad. When I have to wait an additional 11 minutes in-store, I get annoyed.  Please look into getting another POS system. You need more for the rush hours. Also, on a $15 salad, do not prompt on the POS machine to tip. It is take out."}
{"text":"Great variety salads to start with and I really liked the place with its simple original decoration. Friendly atmosphere"}
{"text":"Amazing! I wish I had this close to home!  We got the Mexican and Habibi salad & for my 5 year old I got the brown rice bowl with beans and olive oil with tofu and broccoli. Absolutely perfect! No need to add anything to enhance any flavors!   Who would've thought on vacation in Montreal staying at old Port I would be able to find a healthy vegetarian friendly place where the salad is really a meal? Usually this neighborhood is full of either very good upscale restaurants or tourist traps. Thank you Mandy's!"}
{"text":"Ce bar à salade avait un beau design à l'intérieur.  Le prix est moyen.Le service à la clientèle  était chaleureux . Un incontournable !"}
{"text":"Fresh, big and delicious salads. We went here for lunch twice during our trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Where your salad dreams come true! Whether you want to be healthy for a week or you want to enjoy a filling salad in a cute plate, Mandy's has a salad for every taste! I especially like their asian salad with crunchy ramen noodles, or the mexican salad as a healthy alternative to tortillas and dips.  The restaurant itself is very pretty and hip, and the terrasse is lovely. However, the service can be a little slow for a place that specializes in salads.  All in all, great healthy salads!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here today...wow! I've been to the one in Westmount several times but this new location is amazing. The space is huge, the service is impeccable...starting with the person greeting us at the door and guiding us, the people taking our order, helping us get seated and then the clean up. They have a great selection of Mandy's merchandise as well as other great products like coffee and gourmet pretzels. The salads are a great portion size and delicious...my favorite the 'Man Salad' has now been renamed 'The Lumberjack'....I guess to make it sound even manlier. There's a line to order, but it moves really quickly as there are multiple stations to place your order and they provide you with menus in line while you wait to ensure the line goes faster. Overall, the sisters deserve a huge congrats on this new expansion."}
{"text":"Another great place in old montreal. This is there 4th location in montreal. Love the ambiance and lots of space. They are known for great juices and salads. The system is great, order at the cash and get a seat number. Sit and wait for ur meal :) the wait time was good and what makes this perfect is u don't wait for ur bill. Just leave when ur done!  I like the decor and layout. I ordered the Superfood Salad served with a house dressing. The house dressing is amazing and the salad is packed with flavour. It's one of the more filling salads on the menu.. well as filling as salad can be ;)  I had a lunch meeting there and apparently I wasn't the only one. So it's a great spot for a one one one business or friendly meeting.  Defiantly going back..."}
{"text":"Great place. Had the chicken asian salad which was delicious and filling! Very affordable great linch spot"}
{"text":"Sucker for these salads!   Have been eating Mandy's salad for years now. Ever since they moved their location to their own store in westmount, i have enjoyed my experience picking up and the quality of the salads.  Although it is ridiculous to spend 15 dollars on a salad, it is so large and filling that you don't need to eat it with anything else.   Great place to create your own salad or choose from a diverse menu of salads"}
{"text":"The salad cost me $17 and was okay. The trouble is that they charge you alot for a custom salad, not realizing the toppings were more than toppings, they were what made the salad, so if you ordered onion, pita chips etc etc, you got as much onion as pita chips. The sesame dressing was good, but they don't put enough its quite dry. Would go back to try more things, ask to sample the dressings if you're not sure what you want :) the chicken is cold and dry  - add chick peas for protein if that's what you're going for. Also you can ask to split the salad so you can share with a friend."}
{"text":"So I pay 34 dollars for two salads and one is missing avocado, and the other is missing avocado and brocoli.  I call them to tell them and they say they will offer me extra avocado in my next salad.....Excuse me I do not want extra avocado in my next salad I want it in this one.  I was shocked that a high end salad place can not know their own recipes and what they should put in them.  Is there not a check list to make sure this never happens.  This is the first time in any resto my salad was missing ingredients.  I should have at least been offered a free salad not extra avocado on my next visit.  Very disappointed and will not be returning again and neither will anyone that I know that will listen to me when I tell them not to go there."}
{"text":"Coming from California, I enjoy entree salads and look forward to staying healthy-ish while traveling. Mandy's did not disappoint! There are plenty of salad options to choose from and the service is friendly and fast. There are also plenty of juice/beverage options from kombucha, tea, water, root beer to choose from.  Thank goodness I stopped by to grab a salad before getting to the airport. Why is airport food so, so bad?!   Mandy's would definitely be a place I would frequent if I lived in Montreal.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"You can either make your own salads or choose from one of a dozen salads on the menu. Mandy's lets you choose how much dressing you want as well, from well dressed to slightly dressed, or even naked if you don't want any I suppose. Very fresh ingredients, very generous portions, taste is awesome too. Will definitely be back for more as this place is close to work."}
{"text":"The Mexican bowl had some grit in it either due to spinach leaves or cilantro.  Otherwise, the salad was very fresh, satisfying and tasty.  I managed about half of it as I was at a work lunch but couldn't deal with the sand.  So after my lunch guest left, I went back to the counter to explain the situation. They were more than happy to give me a credit to a free bowl of salad.   So I went back the same week and claimed my free bowl.  They were so cool to offer me any choice of salad bowl and recommended the most expensive salads, the QAISER SALAD ($18.99),  even though I only had the humble Mexican bowl ($12.99).  I've had the QAISER SALAD another time after that on my own dime because it's about as hearty as vegetarian salads can get!  I love the savory mock Shish Taouk chicken.   For that reason and that the salads are legit tasty, I'm a fan :)"}
{"text":"The salads are good , also the place and the staff are nice but the only thing I don't like is sometimes they mixed the ingredients too much"}
{"text":"The worst, most expensive salad I've ever had. I question why it's so popular - maybe because it's trendy. Incredible that a salad that probably cost $2-3 to make, costs upwards of $15!  I would far rather walk 1 block west and get a salad at National Food shop."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing place! Perfect for when you're trying to stay healthy but not spend crazy money on downtown foods. The portions of the salads are huge I could hardly finish mine so it's definitely worth the price! Only con is that if you get there at a busy time and want to eat in it can be hard to find a spot"}
{"text":"Fresh, crisp and tasty.  The choices are abundant. Most are protien free initially and then you can add as you wish.  You can create your own salad if the 20 or so choices don't suit your fancy  I had the Wolfe salad and after a bruiser of a smoked meat sandwich for lunch did not feel the need toj add meat.  Large portions but not overwhelming.   Bright atmosphere and very friendly and helpful staff. Chilled flat and sparkling filtered tap water is a great feature.   ."}
{"text":"Best salad place in town!! Freshest veggies and allows for a variety of substitutions of veggies!"}
{"text":"The best salads in the world, far and away better than comparable spots in NY/TO/LA!! So fresh and bright tasting. Plus the snacks, drinks, chocolates and decor are so thoughtfully curated. It's always jammed with stylish people and for good reason!"}
{"text":"Un vrai de vrai coup de coeur pour cet endroit magnifique! Je passerais ma journée à ce restaurant simplement parce que c'est si beau! Et que dire des salades (gigantesques) !! Elles sont délicieuses! En plus, ils vendent leur vinaigrette si jamais tu trippes trop!! Vraiment, je considère déménager juste à côté pour pouvoir y aller chaque jour !!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best find ever! Salads were perfect. Best chocolate chip cookie ever. Just a wonderful restaurant concept from food to decor to service."}
{"text":"MTL staple food basically. Despite the long lines you'll always be served in max ten minutes. They're really efficient in that sense. In terms of the food; Mandy's is always a great place if you want to grab a filling, healthy meal. They also have juices, cookies, and soups which is nice, but if you come here you have to have the salads. My personal favourite is the Habibi salad, and I've tried three of their other salads (the asian, and two whose names I don't remember), all of which left me full, satisfied, and pleased with what I just ate.   Grab their salads to go and eat them at the McGill quad when the weather's nice, also a fun idea!"}
{"text":"Good but not great. Wanted to see what all the hype was about, it was good but nothing really original or overly tasty. Also, the presumptuous 15%+ recommended tip for counter service is a bit ridiculous."}
{"text":"Great salads. I had the 'Habibi' one. Lot of variety to choose from. Friendly service as well."}
{"text":"Definitely the best of the few salad bars in Montreal. Mandy's menu is very diversified with a almost 15 original and filling salads. You can also create your own salad. I like going there for post workout meals or to grab a quick dinner. Salads are big however a little expensive for a salad."}
{"text":"Salads are pretty good, but nothing extraordinary. Place was packed when we arrived, so we waited 15 minutes for them to prepare the Mexican and Tokyo salad and then we ate them in the park. There are a limited amount of tables here, be warned. Perhaps if we could have snagged a table and eaten on the premises, we could have appreciated the presentation of the salads, which would have added another dimension to the review."}
{"text":"Was recommended to try this place out! it's really decent! kinda small, but a lot of staff working. they have a manager on stand by and noticed I was ready and told the employee to serve me. I can say I am satisfied and would recommend to come by"}
{"text":"The salads are very good. The ingredients used are fresh and the vinegrette is delicious.  The portions are quite big and your definitely don't feel hunger after even if you didn't take any proteins with it.  The wait can be a bit long during lunch hour."}
{"text":"Depuis des mois que j'en entends parler!  Je devais donc venir essayer Mandy's.  J'ai beaucoup aimé ma salade \"Wolf bol\". Généreuse portion servie dans un joli bol.  Même à 14h, l'endroit était bondé. J'ai tout de même pu trouver un siège pour m'asseoir.  Étant situé au centre-ville près des universités, la clientèle est principalement étudiante.  Je le recommande sans hésiter, hors heures de pointes lunch!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I don't know how \"healthy\" the salad is but man oh man is it ever good!!! Just thinking about their salads makes my mouth water. A must try!!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a new favorite. This is a casual dinning place with friendly staff. We went on a Tuesday night; we had called earlier to make a reservation since we were planning on seeing Cirque that night and we were told that they don't take reservations. (Their website said they did.) We got there around 6:20 pm and there was plenty of seating for the 4 of us. After we ordered our food at the register, we went to sit down and we were quickly given both flat and bubbly water for our table. The food came out pretty quickly too. I had the Salmon Sensation, my son had the December special with roasted chicken and my niece had the Mexican salad with chicken too. We all agreed the salads were tasty and not over dressed, with the right proportions of ingredients in our respective salads. Plenty of satisfying ingredients made it for a healthy, and filling meal. My husband who wasn't that hungry had a bowlful of marinated tofu, added some greens from my salad and a berry smoothie. He felt quite satisfied too. I split the Nutella smoothie with my son and  we both agreed when we got back home we would try and duplicate this delicious drink, which included, almond butter, almond milk, Nutella and a banana-all ingredients we typically have on hand.  YUMMY! I just wished we had a Mandy's in California where we live, as I could easily see trying all the salads!  Encore, encore!s is definitely a favorite."}
{"text":"Love Mandy's, great healthy fast food option. This location has expanded and has more seating now, which is awesome! Food is always fresh and staff is very friendly :)"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the salads and service I had was excellent. Dressings are lovely and good kombucha"}
{"text":"Amazing place for lunch.  The salads are delicious and the portion sizing is huge! Good thing it's a salad so there is no harm in actually finishing what you get! I've had the Tokyo and the Mexican - both were really incredible.   They have a  really great selection of drinks - my recommendation would be Fentiman's Rose Lemonade.   If you're feeling sinful end the meal with their scrumptious chocolate chip cookies. You deserve a cookie after the healthy salad you just ate.   Warning: it was pretty crowded during lunch time so I would budget your time accordingly! Maybe go a little earlier or later so you can nab a good spot on their terrace!"}
{"text":"This is about as fancy as a salad can get. The menu is extensive and very creative. You can never have a boring salad here, so even if you are deathly allergic to veggies (like me), you will find something that you absolutely love. My favourite is of course the Man salad, filled with all kinds of meat and sauce. But there's something delicious here for everyone, even purely leafy ones!! Hands down my favourite salad bar in Montreal :)"}
{"text":"Incredible, imaginative salads. Very convenient and cute location.  Fast service.  Good choice of beverages.  Crazy expensive for what you get.  I've started using their menu to try and recreate the recipes yet I still come back for more.       Wild Sage is where it's at."}
{"text":"My favourite salad place anywhere including New York City. I always get the Caesar salad as the Caesar dressing is homemade and light unlike all other Caesar dressings I've had. I love the pita chips instead of croutons for the crunch. I always get great service too as I am quite the regular. Great for lunch or dinner as the salads are large and filling."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Montreal for a long weekend.  With thousands of options we ended up eating here twice.  Really diverse, healthy, delicious options!  Great decor and atmosphere.  Great for a casual lunch!  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Been to this beautiful cafe twice. It's so so pretty and with the warm weather upon us, the little sidewalk set-up they have makes it even more enticing. The service is stellar and the staff is very knowledgeable about the menu. They give you a large helping of an endless selection salad.  Reminds me of the giant California salads that I love. You definitely leave full and happy that you made a healthy meal choice. But the dressing on the ones I've had just doesn't make the mark for me. I will return, though. Because on my last visit, I was offered a sample of their mushroom \"chicken.\"  It was very tasty and you wouldn't even know it was not meat."}
{"text":"Nice little quiet spot for a nice healthy lunch, I took the Asian tai salad to go. It has ramen noodles and a sesame oil dressing it was actually delicious. The only problem I have with this spot is that he salads are pretty pricey... The cheapest one is 10 dollars... Yeah ur thinking 10 bucks for salad.  It's worth trying of your big on health food  or of your just curious like I was."}
{"text":"Great find for delicious, fresh, huge salad.  There are a variety of salads on the menu or design your own with tons of ingredients to choose from.  Bright, cheerful atmosphere and friendly, helpful staff. Only one suggestion, add fresh baked bread choices."}
{"text":"Wow... everything about this place is exceptional. Amazingly friendly staff who are more than willing to help our customers with anything; they also speak fluent english so there are no language barrier problems like at other places in montreal we've gone to. The salad I got was probably one of the best salads I've ever had and I definitely recommend their mock chicken for vegans and vegetarians."}
{"text":"It was OK, but not amazing. I won't be rushing back next time I'm in Montreal. It seems overpriced for what it is.   The Curry Quinoa salad was pretty bland. Maybe they were just having an off day but I was disappointed."}
{"text":"This is quite the restaurant. I would say a tad girly for my tastes, but the salad was amazing! Absolutely delicious and so many choices. I would definitely go back and try a different salad the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Best salad spot I've ever been to. Ordered the salad of the month with the tamari dressing - which was amazing. Love this spot - they need it in Toronto."}
{"text":"I cannot remember when was the last time I had such a great salad. I ordered the endless summer salad with white tuna, the quality is more than enough if you are very hungry. The product felt fresh and the mix was well balanced."}
{"text":"For anyone who thinks that you can't make a full meal out of salad, I DARE you to try Mandy's.   They've somehow mastered the art of salad making. It's as if they went on a salad pilgrimage and studied the Way of Sal for years on some secluded mountaintop, to return with the rituals and age old knowledge that can only be achieved through some enlightened teachings and a relentless dedication to the craft.   If I'm not making it clear yet: THESE ARE SOME TASTY FREAKIN SALADS.   My personal favourite is the Wolfe, but I encourage you to discover them all on your own."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about Mandy's so it was long overdue for me to try this place for myself!  A friend of mine highly recommended it saying that its so good that even people who don't usually enjoy salad can be converted into fans by Mandy's. After trying it myself, I have to say I agree with her.  First off, this location is adorable inside with a modern airy décor and lively atmosphere. Service was impeccable, they were very friendly. they did not make any mistakes on my order and I got my food quickly.  The price is about 15-25$ (with tax) for their salads (depending on the selection and any extras), so while this is a little on the pricey side, what I can say is that the portion is VERY generous and it is very well prepared with fresh quality ingredients which they don't skimp on!  I had the Wolfe Bowl (Arugula+other mixed greens, shredded carrot, Parmesan, quinoa, cherry tomatoes, kale , lots of avocado, walnuts and sesame seeds + I added Grilled chicken). It was delicious and filling, everything was so fresh and well balanced with a nice light vinaigrette style dressing. The added grilled chicken was key, it really added to it. So while I think it would be too pricey to come here on the daily for lunch, I can safely say I will be coming back to try more of their salads."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner, was intrigued by the window signage that it was just salad, well it was very good salad you have two choices you can either design your own salad with any number of options, or you can choose from the menu options. The portion of the salad was very large it is for sure a \"big salad\" ( Seinfeld anyone?) The price for a salad as a main was very reasonable. An enjoyable meal for sure :)"}
{"text":"I heard about Mandy's from everyone in Montreal so I had to give it a try...I ventured in on a weekday evening and the place was quite busy.   There's limited seating inside, but they have a really nice patio. And of course, Mandy's is great for takeout.   The aesthetics of this place is awesome. Very rustic and historic with floral aesthetics and a pleasant atmosphere.   The storefront was bustling and it has a really great aroma. There are menus all over the place and the menus are also online if you want to take a look before you arrive.   I decided on the santorini before I approached the cashier, but I asked for a recommendation on what protein to include. The cashier suggested tempeh, and I happily accepted.   It took about 5-10 minutes for them to prepare the salad in the back, but you can enjoy some refreshing mint water while you wait. The friendly cashier came around cash to give me my order which was a nice touch.   The santorini salad is made with watermelon, red onions, feta, basil, romaine lettuce, couscous, and a really great vinaigrette. What really pushed me to get this salad was the watermelon and I have no regrets! The tempeh was also quite delicious and cooked perfectly! The ingredients were extremely fresh and flavourful - you can really tell they put in a lot of effort into preparing the salads.   My only concern is I paid nearly $20 for salad. While it definitely is filling, it probably won't be my go-to meal every week - perhaps every once in a while. Still worth checking out though!"}
{"text":"their salad tastes great and there's a lot of variety with the ingredients you can put. their premade salad choices are also good. to be honest, the food probably rates as an 8.5/10  now here's the catch: their food is WAY too expensive. sure their portions are filling, but most salads range between 15 and 20$.   for that much money you could get 1.5 extra large pho orders, all you can eat sushi, or two orders of stir fry from marianopolis' overpriced cafeteria - or, you can settle for a salad from mandy's that sure tastes good but might not fill you as much or have as exciting of a flavour  i mean it's basically leaves   i can't really comment on the service, it was pleasant and polite the times i've been  all joking aside, mandy's has good food, decor, and service for a very high price considering the type of food and portions. it's location is appropriate i guess (west mount)"}
{"text":"Bar à Salade et Sandwicherie. Deux mots pour mangé à sa faim sans ce sentir coupable. L'ambiance est géniale mais il faut être patient durant l'heure du lunch: c'est très achanlandé. Ils offrent une grande sélection pour tout les goûts et les portions sont généreuse. Commande sur place ou par téléphone on ressort de cet endroit avec le ventre plein."}
{"text":"Though I am physically pained by the fact that I just spent $20.09 on a salad, I have to admit that it was pretty damn amazing! Picking up fast food/take out from the usual places is cheap, but deeply unsatisfying. Sometimes you're just craving a healthy and delicious salad. Mandy's definitely satisfies in that department.  I've eaten in at this location once but mostly take out. The staff are friendly and although it is always busy, they are really efficient.  So far, I've made a few \"design your own\" salads and  tried the Wolfe Bowl and the Reagan-Danielle Extraordinaire. I added mock chicken to both those salads for some extra substance. Though the \"chicken\" is tasty and filling, I'm not sure that it is worth an extra $5. Both salads were delicious and made with fresh ingredients. The portions are huge and filled with ingredients (they don't just try to fill it with lettuce to reduce cost).   I think Montreal needs more restaurants like this. Possibly when there is competition, they will lower the somewhat ridiculous prices. Overall, the salads are delicious, the price is insane but even so, I'll continue to buy them on special occasions/once a week!  Food: 5/5 Value:3/5 Ambiance: 3/5 (It gets pretty busy) Service 5/5"}
{"text":"Always friendly staff and delicious salads, the only thing for me is the price. It is on the pricey end for a salad."}
{"text":"Literally the only place I go for lunch. The location is convenient for students, and the prices are even better. The salads are fresh, delicious, and extremely filling. My favorite would be the superfood salad, minus the kale (hard to chew). Also, I would like to see red quinoa added to the menu, not just white!"}
{"text":"Great big salads in a twee style in the otherwise very corporate downtown area.  Great for lunch on the fly or settle down with your laptop. Wi-Fi was down though..."}
{"text":"Les salades sont excellentes j'avais pris la habibi il était 12h et y'avait plus de patate douce on me l'a remplacé par du mais j'étais un peu déçu surtout  qu'il était à peine 12h . Pour le goût la vinaigrante surtout c'était excellent rien à dire par contre le grand bémol c'est le prix presque 16$ après taxes et tips de 15% je trouve ça a la limite aberrant c'est pour ça que je ne mets pas 5 étoiles"}
{"text":"My friend brought me to this place and she took her favourite salad: Summer salad and I tried a bit. I really like their mix and the vinaigrette was amazing! The restaurant is very artsy and their forks are made with potato, thus biodegradable! It's indeed a very green salad bar!"}
{"text":"Nice salade bar! My favorite is Asian salade. It tastes so goooooood! I tried Tokyo salade too, but I felt it's too sour and tofu inside is too salty."}
{"text":"Joy! An infinite number number of tasty combinations in charming setting. So so happy to stumble on Mandy's on my recent trip to Montreal.  Big portions too!"}
{"text":"First time trying their new location. So much better then the one on Crescent. The space is really beautiful!! Their Thai Chicken salad was to die for! So good!! The displays are amazing I have my eye on the California Chocolate bars : the cereal one looks amazing! Bathrooms clean and chic the smell of the soap which is by Aeop next door is so beautiful it's totally worth mentioning. Who walks out of a cafe talking about the hand soap?!"}
{"text":"My second visit wasn't so successful. I'm turned off by this salad store and I will not go back. Last week I ordered a Mandy's Le Fave salad to-go and it was like sludge. The dressing made the lettuce soggy and I gagged on the first bite. The salad cost me (with tip that I was forced to give because I used a CC to pay) FIFTEEN DOLLARS. Absolutely ridiculous! I understand this is a small entrepreneur business, but that is WAY too much for what you get. I would return for the smoothies, which unlike all the salads offered, are a fair price and worth what you get. Definitely won't buy any more salads from there though."}
{"text":"I find that Montreal is lacking in the salad/health restaurant department, so if you want a healthy yet satisfying meal, Mandy's is the place to fill that void. The lack of competition probably explains the somewhat outrageous prices, which is my only drawback.   That being said, service is friendly and the atmosphere is incredibly welcoming. The outdoor seating area is also a huge bonus.  I'd recommend it if you are willing to splurge a little for a healthful meal experience."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love Mandy's salads (all locations). So why only 2 stars?  The ingredients. When you get a good salad here, it's amazing! However, half the time, you will find a problem with your salad. Last week, the avocado in my Cobb salad was brown and I had it 5 minutes after it was prepared. This week, my man salad had undercooked flabby bacon. If bacon is not crispy in a salad, it is so unpleasant to bite and chew on pieces of fat!! A few weeks ago I had a great asian salad with extra chicken. The salad was good, but the added chicken was so dry I just discarded it.   Taj soup is only broth with chickpeas, cauliflower  and shredded carrots. Also VERY oily for a soup. Taste is disappointing. Same broth they use in the matzo ball soup.   Sometimes, they go very heavy on dressing/oil, so I ask for a bit less.   The price... An abibi salad (lettuce, chick peas, tomatoes, etc, no meat) will cost you 15$. It never bothers me to pay high prices for my food, if it's justified by the ingredients, the type of cuisine or the location. In this case, it really isn't.   Definitely place for improvement, but concept is great. Service is friendly and effective."}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying Mandy's and I was beyond impressed. My salad was AMAZING. It is also located on one of Montreal's nicest streets - rue Crescent. The interior was very nice and clean. There's also an option to eat outside when the weather permits. Another cool thing was that they sell a lot of other stuff on the side such as: juice, desserts, and even their super cute salad bowls!  Although I enjoyed my salad, it was very pricey. I opted for the \"create your own salad\" option and it got quite expensive. Fortunately, the size was very reasonable and as mentioned before, it tasted good. Another thing was that the seating arrangement was kind of awkward. There are a few big tables and everyone has to try to squeeze in. It can get loud around rush hour so having that many people in one area just results in all of the conversations overlapping.   Overall, my only complaints are that it can get pricey, and the seating-related issues. Other than that, food's great, service was good, and I loved the atmosphere. I would 100% recommend Mandy's if you're looking for some really good salad!   Side note - for those who don't feel like dining in, they deliver!"}
{"text":"Delicious salads!!! Really fast also, and they have a great variety of choices. When it's warm they have a really cute outdoor patio as well. One of my favorite restaurants in Montreal. 10/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"Soooo cool. I don't want to be sexist but I'd say Mandy's is probably more feminine than male. I mean I would recommend it to my girl friends and maybe not so much to guys. The wifi password was UNICORN, you see? There are pretty flowers on the tables and the menu consists of countless healthy salads. I loved it all. Although... maybe the pink couch in the corner is a bit much ^^  The music is cool too and it's spacious so I felt comfortable staying much longer than I needed for finishing my soy latte a yummy choc chip cookie (which was served on a tile! Heavy but cool). I'll come again and report to you how I ate my way through the salad bowls."}
{"text":"I lived and worked by their Westmount shop for a year and found myself there every week. Delicious options for everyone and every diet. Staff is always friendly.  Go to: Asian salad with sunflower seeds in place of crunchy noodles."}
{"text":"Biggest salads on the planet! Tucked away in the back of Mimi and Coco's clothing shop on Laurier, Mandy is whipping up some amazing/yummy/huge ass salads. SO much choice, options and the bowls are so pretty on top of it. I love how the windows in the back make it such  bright, serene little nook of a place to refuel between bouts of shopping. The ladies here are pretty darn amazing and you will have enough salad for the next day and it tastes just as yum :) I hear they have a take-out option, I will have to give that a go for sure."}
{"text":"Large portions, but as many other reviewers have said, it's so expensive! Further, service is slow and it's always crowded. The table set-up in the restaurant makes it difficult to find a seat if you're in a group of more than 2. The ingredients (though fresh) are also not special or creative - certainly not worth $15+. For the price, you might as well make it yourself!"}
{"text":"Before I tried this one, I was like, people are acting too much, salads taste same but the second I put Wolfe Bol I'm impressed!! It tastes so good!!"}
{"text":"I recently picked up the Danielle-Raeghan salad to go, with mock chicken. I used to LOVE this salad and ate every last morsel. However, I've been quite disappointed with the salad the last couple of times I've brought it. Maybe 3-4 chunks of avocado, 5 pieces of strawberry and just barely enough mock chicken to justify the extra cost for it (barely!). The salad seems to be lacking in flavour and in fresh taste. Definitely have noticed a difference in quality since Mandy's has expanded all over the city. I used to crave their salads and had to stop myself from going too often. Lately though, I've unfortunately been disappointed with what I've been getting and keep thinking \"oh maybe it was just a one-time thing, and if I wait long enough the salad will taste amazing etc\"--but no :(  For $20, I expect my salad to have plenty of ingredients (stop being stingy!!) and flavour and freshness.  Pretty pricey disappointing take out lunch this past Wed"}
{"text":"Des passage j'avais besoin de me desalterer , un stop ici m'a fait du bien, tres petit et joli local avec mini terrase."}
{"text":"Fresh and healthy ingrediants, small place but you can take it out. Forget the greed if you want to eat only what you need. Expensive if you have a regular budget.."}
{"text":"Ordered a Cobb Salad, no turkey, no bacon, no blue cheese. Just a bowl of lettuce, avocado and a hard boiled egg! Two salads for $35, what a clip joint."}
{"text":"Each one of their locations is beautiful but this one is spectacular ( the pictures don't do justice).   Located in the heart of old port and very spacious which makes it very practical for lunch. The menu is extensive so there is a variety of items to pick from.   I ordered a customized salad which really good!  I also shared their cookie, truffle and brownie which was absolutely delicious!  The service was wonderful and I will definitely be back. In the summer there is also a patio.   If you're a local or visiting you must visit this location, you will thank me :-)   Ps: congrats Mandy and Rebecca!"}
{"text":"I've visited majority of Mandy's location, and square Phillips is the best one. The staff Camille, and Colin are my two favorites. They are always  on top of everything, very catering to their clients and friendly. Sometimes I don't even have to state my order and they already know it. I love love the quinoa, I've also purchased majority of the sauces. Keep up the great work at this location!!"}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place! Their menu of salads is amazing, but you can also order a custom salad with any assortment of toppings, types of lettuce, and dressings. It's definitely on the expensive side for a salad (between $13 and $15 depending on the number of toppings), but definitely worth it given the freshness of the ingredients.   Try to eat there if you can rather than taking a salad to go - the salad tastes way better in the big ceramic bowls!"}
{"text":"I have been to Mandys 3 times in the past month because I cannot get enough of this place. I have not dared to veer away from my favourite item yet--the Man Salad--in fear nothing will live up to it. The salads are huge, staff is friendly, and the interior beautiful. Prices may seem expensive, but when you see the size of the salads and the amount of ingredients in each, it becomes more reasonable.   Fear not, the long lines move quickly even in the lunchtime rush!"}
