{"text":"I have been to much worse Chinese buffets.  At this one, the food is warm and sometimes, if you go on a good night they do have a great selection.  The salad rolls, sweet and sour pork, deep fried shrimp and chicken are always a good choice.  I would pick over the salads and skip the desert.  I do have at least a second plate at the buffet though.  Great place to go if your super hungry and craving Chinese."}
{"text":"Food was average ... buffet selection was VERY limited .. I have paid a few dollars more at other places for 4 times the selection"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent price. Service is average, but who cares when the food is abundant and delitious."}
{"text":"This one is one of the few Asian Buffets I'll go frequently in Calgary. The food is fairly good, which can be seen from the returning clients like myself. it is a popular place. Try this place on a weekday as usually you can get seated right away. Not the most spacious eating here, but what they offer is worth coming. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had a huge craving for Chinese after work and New Dynasty was the first thing that came to mind.  My Husband and I thought we would eat in for a change.  They had an evening buffet on.  We waited for a little while before someone came out to the front and seated us.  This place has renovated extensively since the last time I actually ate in here, which was a long while ago.  It is quite nice inside with wood working, huge mirror murals, it reminded me of a restaurant in Hong Kong.  Once seated our server came and took our drink order.  There is a separated area for the buffet now, opposed to having it in the middle of the restaurant like it used to be.  They have about 14 hot options.  The salads were very, very sad.  There was caesar salad that had so much dressing on it, I could barely eat it.  the other salads consisted of potato, corn, bean, which did not appear appetizing at all.  They were good about bringing fresh food out continuously.  The ginger beef was as good as ever, the other hot entrees were hit and miss.  Their dessert hasn't changed, it only consists of tarts, jello, which isn't even in individual cups anymore, as well as rice pudding, which makes me want to vomit just thinking about it.  Our buffets with 2 pops cost $32, the buffet was $14 each.

I feel like the quality and variety of the buffet could be better.  The servers were good about taking our plates, but the service could have been a bit more friendly overall.  Even though the place has had a face lift, the service and buffet could use one too.  I'll stick to ordering out."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but quite bland. Food I normally look forward to, wasn't tasty.  Service was okay.  The restaurant was Not what I expected based on the other Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"I just absolutely love Chinese food so whenever I'm back in town on holidays this is the place to go. It's hard to go wrong with the buffet. I literally go there and just stack my plate high, just ain't nobody got time for a second trip (well maybe sometimes haha). I have never had a bad meal here yet."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic if you get there early.  We've been a few times for a quick lunch before the Crowfoot gaming meetup that we go to and honestly the earlier you go for the lunch buffet the better.  The most recent time, we arrived as the dishes had just come out of the kitchen on the first batch and it was so good we stuffed ourselves silly.

I almost couldn't walk away from my tea...though it turns out I was able to walk away from my purse by accident...Luckily the manager (I think he's the manager...he certainly acts like he knows his stuff) saw me coming back and watched over it for me!

I always go for the delicious wonton soup, ginger beef, and anything else that looks great.  The sweet & sour pork is best when it's fresh from the kitchen and there's even cinnamon-sugar wontons and jello for dessert...

It's a monthly treat now!"}
{"text":"A small-ish but decent buffet Chinese food restaurant. I really liked a few of the dishes but it is nothing special by way of a such restaurant. We held a special event there and it was very accommodating to our group but there isn't space for us to have a private area at the restaurant or anything of that sort. Staff were really efficient at clearing plates which was nice. 

I would consider this a middle-of-the-road Westernized Chinese food buffet. I wish that the food descriptions were written on both sides of the buffet tables rather than just on one side of each item. The dishes are often at a distance from the food they are needed for (eg. soup bowls are not near the soup) which seems like an odd decision to make."}
{"text":"This is a weird spot to review.  We went there for a family dinner last night, and we were the only Chinese table in there.  I think they want to cater to both sides of the coin so they also have an all-you-can-eat buffet, which was filled with the regular type foods you find in buffets (ginger beef, S&P squid, fried rice, chow mein).  Didn't try this so not sure of the quality or taste, but the people that went for it seemed to enjoy it, and it has been reviewed by others.

Our family went off the genuine Chinese menu and ordered a preset meal plan for the   Seafood Dinner.  When we saw the bustle at the buffet, we weren't sure what to expect on the real Chinese food side of things.  And here's the kicker - the food was really excellent.  I react badly to MSG and there was no reaction, so the food here is good tasting which minimal MSG.  But we were a little uncomfortable with all the people gawking at us as they went to the buffet line a few times.  A lot of Chinese families don't like this either, they would prefer to go to a place that has no buffet and is a genuine Chinese-style restaurant.  The service was friendly and fast, with plenty of parking in this strip mall.

We will return but maybe ask for the side room behind the buffet so we can have a little privacy.  Or we'll just order pick-up takeout."}
{"text":"Probably the worst place I have ever been in my life. Food is terrible. No selection. Service is bad!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to bring your family (especially fussy teenagers)!  We've been here mostly for the lunch buffet, although there was a time (when I was pregnant) when hubby and I came here for a la carte dinners.  (Mmmm... crab with ginger, green onion and glass vermicelli).    They've renovated the interior since then.
The buffet fare is pretty standard, with cold items such as beets, green salad, and fruit. Hot items include hot and sour soup, wonton soup, stir fried egg noodles, Shanghai noodles with pork, mixed vegetables, fried tofu, deep fried chicken wings, sweet and sour pork with pineapple, pepper beef, spring rolls, and ginger beef.  Hmmm, I would really like to see them put out some salt and pepper squid...
There is also a fairly good selection of dessert items--tapioca pudding, jello(sugar free with aspartame--meh), apple and lemon tarts, rice krispie squares, and fruit salad.
The service here is better than most Chinese restaurants; the staff do smile and greet you and it's easy to catch the attention of a server.  They also take reservations for large groups."}
{"text":"This place seems to have a loyal following and it's easy to see why - consistency.  I've eaten here a few times and the buffet is okay and the a la carte is pretty standard.  If you're a fan of chicken balls then you'll like the food here."}
{"text":"We normally go for the all you can eat (AYCE) Sunday lunch buffet. The hot and sour soup can be good, and so can the ginger beef, but most of the items are ordinary. There's a selection of desserts, including tapioca and rice pudding as well as jello, so if you guessed this is a (slightly) pricier alternative to food court fare, pat yourself on the back. Interior is nicer/cleaner than average for places of this type."}
{"text":"We decided to try the lunch buffet at New Dynasty.  Like Zoe, we haven't been to New Dynasty for a while.  A lot of renovation has taken place since we were there last.  All that ugly blue walls and old carpet is replaced with wood finishings and new carpet.  The buffet area is now moved to the back of the restaurant and is separated from the dining area with half a wall.  

On to the food - the buffet itself was meh.  I've tasted better.  There was 20 or more items in the buffet.  I tried the fried chicken - not salted enough; the ginger beef - not bad; noodles - ok, fried rice - ok, hot n sour soup - a little too vinegary; the wonton soup - had the wontons - ok; sweet & sour pork - good; salad bar - sad looking; vegetables - counted only 3 dishes with vegetables - black bean green beans, stir-fried vege and a beef with zucchinni - ok; dessert - tapicoa pudding - good, rice pudding - bad with too much cinnamon, jello - ok; fruits - sad looking.

Wil I come back?  Nope!"}
{"text":"Went to New Dynasty this week for the buffet dinner.  Buffet was quite good with all the food trays well stoked and hot.  The dessert selection is unsurprisingly underwhelming but overall a good value for the $13.95 cost."}
{"text":"Easy to order, fast deliver ... but very ho hum food :(.  I had ordered once before but forgot why I hadn't used them after .. now I remember !!  Very disappointed in the taste that and the cashew chicken, and tons of mushrooms to hide the lack of chicken!!"}
