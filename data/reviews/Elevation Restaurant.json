{"text":"Went to the bar called Ollie's Gastropub for a happy hour. The cocktails and craft beer were excellent, but the stand out was the views. Sweeping vistas in every direction create an ambiance that has to be experienced firsthand in order to be truly appreciated. Best seat in the house is the window table which looks down on home base of PNC Park. I can't wait to return during baseball season when there is a fireworks night. This is downtown Pittsburgh's highest restaurant, hence the name Elevation. We also ate the corndogs and chicken tenders, both made from scratch and delicious."}
{"text":"WORST dining EXPERIENCE I have EVER had.  Where do I start?   We put in a reservation for 7pm. Upon arriving, there was no one there to greet us. A manager across the lobby stared at us while we wandered back and forth looking for the restaurant. Around the corner, we had to walk through a group of hotel guests who were eating at a free lunch buffet. When someone finally asked us if we were eating at the restaurant, they said \"let us set up a table for you\". Umm... what happened to the reservation?  We sit down in a brightly lit space. The entire area felt cheap and un-decorated. No big deal, lets hope the food and service are good... nope.  The waiter was nice, but had NO CLUE what he was doing. It took forever for him to come to are table, which was strange because there was only one other table seated in the whole place. Then he took our food order, and said he would be back for drink and appetizer orders... wtf? Did I mention that the menu had chicken quesadillas as a random appetizer? That should have been our first clue... Then the waiter brought half frozen, cheap white bread to the table with a lump of butter on top of all the bread. I was more confused than anything.  We got up and left because after all of that misery, we STILL hadn't gotten drinks. No way was I going to drop 40 bucks on a filet from a place like this. One of our group spoke to the manager, and she gave us some bullshit spiel about how sorry she was.   Went to a different restaurant and had a normal, tasty meal. This place needs to close, hire and train all new staff, redecorate, re-do the menu, and just generally get its shit together if they want any chance of success.  I have never in my life been so upset about a restaurant experience that I felt compelled to write an angry review, but yet, here we are."}
{"text":"I would consider myself a fish sandwich connoisseur and let me tell you....they do fish sandwiches right!!!  I work downtown and have been searching for the perfect fish sandwich.  There are definitely some solid fish sandwiches downtown, but Elevation took the cake!  Also, the lobster corn chowder......DELISH!   Whether you are a fish sandwich rookie or connoisseur like myself, I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Waited 5 minutes at the maitre d station. No one spoke to us. Two tables had not been bussed and I overheard that a woman had to wait 20 minutes for her dressing.   Piss poor."}
{"text":"Had lunch today with a friend.  The service was fine (the waiter is a bit of a fun character), but everything else wasn't.  I ordered a chicken sandwich with bacon and avocado.  The fries were cold and seemed old, and the chicken seemed to have been made in a microwave.  My friend ordered a $12 salad and asked for salmon on top of it.  When we got the bill i included another $12 charge for the salmon, making it a $24 salad.  There are much better restaurants downtown.  No wonder the place was empty.  Never again."}
{"text":"The place is brand new, clean, and looks great. Menu is quite enticing as well. However, it's got serious growing pains to conquer with what appears to be an equally brand new and disorganized waitstaff. Left after 20 minutes without ordering entrees due to the experience.  Will return in a few weeks or months and give it another shot."}
{"text":"This was not a positive experience. Our boss graciously took our team to lunch, so we were a large party. We had about 18 different servers, and while they were nice, it was obvious they did not know what was going on.   The restaurant was empty, the food was pretty average. A colleague ordered a glass of red which the waiter spilled on her (the entire thing!). We requested some soda water to get the stain out, but there was no offer to pay for dry cleaning. Mistakes happen we understand, but help us out, not to mention this is a hotel that I'm sure uses some sort of dry cleaning service... I think the icing on the cake was being charged for the wine and the soda water, neither of which were consumed, plus 18% gratuity via a separate checks at the end of the meal.   My boss received the check at the end of the meal, no she received three different checks, because the waiter said we had three servers...um what? She promptly paid for our food. Those that ordered alcohol paid separately. After waiting about 30 minutes and not seeing anyone (again, empty restaurant!) we went to try to find our server. He came back with a few different bills. He had not tracked who had ordered what drinks so there were random bills with outstanding beverages on them (ie soda water and spilled wine), plus the 18% gratuity.   When we raised a concern and questioned some of the charges, he brought back his manager because he thought we were skipping out on paying some of the bill. Um no, we have been sitting waiting for you, and now are questioning why you charged us for soda water, wine that wasn't consumed because it was spilled, and why you added an 18% gratuity to every single Individual drink bill. The manager said nothing and did nothing. We just handed them our credit cards so we could leave.   When my boss and others tried to patiently explain to someone, anyone, our experience, we were told the food and beverage manager was on her way. She never came, and then we were told she left for the day. Is no one else managing the hotel that could help us?   All in all this was a poor experience. We work down the street for a large company, why would I send vendors and out of towners to this hotel when there are far better options? I will not, and neither will 15 of the colleagues I went to lunch with. The sad thing is, I don't think this place cares. Needless to say we won't be back!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. Decided to give it a try. I'm a fan of taking an elevator up to the restaurant. I loved the atmosphere when first arriving to the 25th floor. After being seated we were greeted by our waiter Brian. He was very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. I ordered a house salad and Roasted chicken which was fabulous. My fianc√© got a chicken caesar salad which was also great. Over all the whole experience was a good one. I think we will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"There's just something about getting on an elevator to go to a restaurant. I like it. I don't know why. Well, color me excited that Elevation is located on the 25th floor of the Oliver Building. Upon exiting the elevators I was greeted with a pleasant, modern, hotel lobby vibe. Good thing, considering I was in the [Embassy Suites] hotel lobby; and just around the corner was Elevation.    The hostess was kind and welcoming, and sat our party of four immediately. Elevation's menu made for a tough lunch-time decision, as I really wanted to try a bit of everything. Me and the fabulous Kristin W. agreed to go splitsies on the Crab Cake Salad and the Grilled Vegetable Sandwich.  The former was a huge plate of romaine, a few slices of avocado, a bit of tomato and one crab cake. While the crab cake was good, for a salad of that size (and price/$15), I might expect two instead. Not a deal-breaker, but worth mentioning. The sandwich was exceptional. The grilled veggies were melted together with provolone on a whole wheat ciabatta bun SO good I'm dedicated to tracking down the bakery from whence it came. The sandwich was accompanied by a nice handful of seasoned fries and, at $10 for the combo, pretty cheap! We also indulged in two desserts - the Hummingbird Cake, a southern spice cake with cream cheese icing and the Housemade Cookie Platter. Honestly, I'd pass on both and maybe try one of their other creations. Neither of these two were all that noteworthy, in my humble opinion.    Though our server was a bit strange, our overall experience was great! Next time I'm opting for the Fried Catfish Sandwich. Looked delicious and, at $8, I can afford to eat every day. I won't - but I COULD, and that's what's important."}
{"text":"I normally don't trust hotel restaurants but this restaurant changed my mind. Having the Ollie salad as my starter was the perfect match to the pasta I had. Both were perfectly crafted and tasted fantastic."}
{"text":"I've been there for lunch three times. Fair prices. Everyone always really likes the food.  The environment is very relaxing and nicely decorated.  Great views from the windows."}
{"text":"Good stuff hard to find but big good space and great food. The menu made sense and was not pretentious."}
{"text":"Just came back from lunch at the new Elevation restaurant at the Embassy Suites (Henry W. Oliver Building). First, this restaurant is on the 25th floor in part of the space where the law firm K&L Gates used to be. This actually used to be their lunchroom. The lunch menu was excellent. Very well-priced and everything was quite tasty. Our service was top notch as well. Daniel (our server) was excellent, taking great care to make sure we were satisfied and had everything we needed. He deserves major kudos for taking great care of us. I will definitely be back again for lunch and dinner.  Check out the pool while you're there. It's comparable to any other pool. However, it was an engineering feat, as it is located on the 25th floor as well!   Kudos to Elevation for a great experience and for continuing to raise the bar for Pittsburgh's restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Stopped in after the marathon. The food was great! Loved everything! We had the Quesadilla and fried Mac and Cheese. My friend ate the fried Mac and Cheese in about 2 minutes, he Loved it! I had the capreese salad. The tomatoes we so ripe and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great location, Great atmosphere, Great Staff and Great food... all around fantastic! I can't say anything negative wel... except that I wish the both style seating around the windows were elevated so you could see the beautiful views. The atmosphere is upscale, warm and inviting. The staff is above and beyond! The food exquisitely presented and The Taste melts in your mouth. Perfect for any business lunch or evening out or even a Sunday afternoon brunch."}
{"text":"I love coming to Elevation! I currently work in the Henry W. Oliver Building with the Embassy Suites, and it's the perfect little place to grab lunch! I have only visited Elevation for lunch and it has never been crowded. The waiter (most likely Dan) is a character and makes sure you're well taken care of. Unfortunately I haven't been able to veer from the Chicken Bacon Avocado Sandwich, but the two times I had it, it's been more than delicious! Their fries are fresh cut and come with some seasoning on them - almost like an Old Bay seasoning, but not real strong. My co-worker always gets the Shrimp Tacos and she loves them! They are sesame shrimp and there's usually about 2-3 shrimp on the taco. I also came here with another co-worker who ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad for lunch and it was a pretty big serving with plenty of chicken pieces! They also mentioned that the cheddar broccoli soup was delicious!  I'm convinced there isn't a bad meal at this restaurant and the atmosphere is modern and sleek. However, The booths sit a little far from the tables, I had to sit on the very edge of the booth while I ate. I hear the tables in the back by the windows are the best with the view! The waiter is a little intruding at times, but he means well!  Overall, it's a very nice restaurant to visit, especially during lunch being that you're most likely to be one of 3-5 parties there, so your food is brought out pretty quickly. And pricing isn't bad for the quality and quantity that you receive!"}
{"text":"One person doing host, expo and service. Soup was cold and food took longer than it should have. Avoid except at peak hours or for free times."}
{"text":"No. Just no. My son and I were headed to a show at PPG Arena and wanted to eat somewhere near by. I saw that this spot had good reviews so we thought we would try it. My son called and made reservations.  The day came at I met him in the hotel lobby. We took the elevator up to the 25th (27th?? Can't remember) floor where the restaurant is. When we got there we were told that they weren't ready yet. We didn't even tell them we had reservations. So we waited. . . and waited. Finally my son walked over to the bar and told them that we had reservations. The bartender called a server out. She asked us if we were doing fine dining. I said that I wanted to check out the menu to see what they had. She took us to the back of the restaurant. We found out later that there was a nicer area but it was closed off. All of a sudden all of these people started coming in. It took us a minute and we realized that they were guests of the Embassy hotel. They must have been given tickets for free drinks. The bar line was long and stayed long. They were also given access to a very small snack buffet. The server that waited on us was the one and only server working the entire restaurant. She was constantly cleaning tables and checking on the snack buffet. So we had to wait ridiculous amounts of time to order, to get our food, and to even pay.  I had ordered a cup of lobster and corn chowder. When I finally got it, it was barely room temperature. It tasted like it was straight out of a can. There was one tiny piece of lobster and about half a can of corn. I hadn't eaten since breakfast and was starving so I ate it. My son tried it and gave it a hard pass.  As my entree I ordered shrimp tacos. There was seemed to be fresh pico on it but the shrimp was 90% breading. Not good.  My son ordered the club type sandwich. It had a nice portion of meat on it and tasted ok. (That is what the one star is for.).   Was very disappointed from start to finish. I won't be back. Ever."}
{"text":"After my wife and I had some trouble finding an open place to eat on a Sunday night, we made reservations here.  A very aesthetically clean cut place that lends itself to a finer dining experience but not easily exclusive as such.  Got seated quickly with drinks served, ordered couple apps of crab cakes and feta stuffed lamb meatballs which were magnificent.  Myself I had the filet mignon which was cooked to perfection and incredibly tender.  My wife's pasta was some red tomato wine sauce had chorizo and few other meats was good, very filling, but is something seemingly one could easily throw together at home. Dessert, now this was where this place got it's fifth star for sure.  Several good options but none better than the sticky toffee pudding.  A bread pudding topped with vanilla ice cream normally, they were out so almond gelato was utilized and made it so much better I felt.  Lastly caramel drizzled over it.  I would go just to order this dessert alone.  As for price, it's on par with most other restaurants in the downtown area, but nothing super outrageous."}
{"text":"We went at lunch time and the restaurant wasn't crowded at all. The wait staff was very attentive (perhaps overly so). The menu seems decent, not too expensive for lunch at all. I had the fish sandwich and it was average. Not great, but definitely not bad. The fries are very good, well seasoned and cooked just enough to make them crispy but not burnt. Overall it was a so-so experience. I'm not dying to return anytime soon."}
