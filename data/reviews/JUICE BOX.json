{"text":"I tried the \"BETA Beet\" smoothie. It was really delicious! The girl at the counter was nice and gave her opinions on the smoothies. She recommended \"Green Machine\". The smoothies come in a fairly small cup and are around $9! It's definitely not worth the price. I'd give this place a 5-star rating if they gave you more for your money or lowered the prices. I'll stick to making my smoothies at home for now!"}
{"text":"I visited the Juice Box this weekend and was truly delighted with the entire experience. My husband and I got different flavored smoothies, which were both delicious. If you want a smoothie made with whole vegetables and fruits, skip Smoothie King and visit Juice Box."}
{"text":"Was a nice  juice test fresh 
And staff friendly 
Waiting time its ok 
Overall very good"}
{"text":"This has officially become my go-to for fresh juices and smoothies.  The decor is cool and the people were welcoming and helped my husband and I pick out great drinks for us and the kids.  My hubby is diabetic so he can't have a ton of sugary ingredients in his smoothie.  He got the \"Doctors Orders\" - it had all the recommeded healthy things he needs and was really tasty! I had \"Sweet Greenery\" which was very refreshing, and the guy (forgot his name) was super helpful and recommended  the \"Berry\" and the \"Peanut  Butter & Jelly\" for the kids.  It was a hit! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A juice bar should have fresh juice. Period. What even is this place! First off, pretty much everything is at least $7. So if I am going to pay that much then I expect it to be fresh. 

Some of the menu options were puzzling. Also if you are the type of person who drinks essential oils, this place is for you. But it's a stupid thing to do, FYI - no matter what your prepper uncle who sells them for a living says on Facebook. They are not intended for internal use or consumption. There's your health PSA for the day. 

Anyway, the person at the counter was very friendly - I asked, \"can I make my own?\" after surveying the menu. Sure. Great! I ask for apple, cucumber, parsley, ginger. She looked very puzzled and asked, oh, you want to make your own juice? Yep, that's what I meant when I asked if I could make my own juice and you said yes. So she suggests that I try the greenville something or other, saying it's basically the same thing  - okay, not really but sure. Can you make it with no kale and no spinach? No. At this point we are both pretty confused and then she sort of mumbles that everything is premade. Gross!!  No thanks. Okay can I get just a shot of ginger? Of course. I'm waiting to hear the juicer kick in but silence. Literally 5 seconds later there is a manky little shot glass of old looking ginger juice. $3.75. What!!!

Honestly - this is a joke, right? Every time I am in Charlotte I'm amazed at how NoDa- particularly this location - can manage to open so many new businesses that just miss the mark. You have a place advertising fresh juice. So serve it.  Also you can get one that is cheaper at Earthfare if you are really into the juicing thing. Which I'm not. But at least they are fresh."}
{"text":"This is a newer spot in NoDa and I welcome it with open arms!! They have a variety of blends which makes it easy to order!  The hours are a tad bit non traditional so be sure to check before you go (for example they are closed on Sunday). If you've ever been to Juice Bar (there is one in Ft. Mill) this reminds me of it. All the juice is fresh squeezed and I've yet to try something not tasty! I am doing their juice cleanse - 48-72 juice cleanse (it's like 60 bucks)! Very excited about it! The staff is knowledge and friendly! Great spot among all the unhealthy choices in the area!"}
{"text":"I stopped by the Juice Box after my morning workout today.  I love that they're open early so I still have time to get ready for work! I had the \"Angry Greens\" & it was AMAZING! It tasted so fresh & I love the bite of the jalapeno!  Also, the owner, Kimberly, was incredibly helpful.  I couldn't decide which juice to go with so she described them all in detail for me.  She also gave me a sample of the \"Essential Shots\" because it's something I've always wanted to try.  Really great customer service from the free wifi to the cute dog bowl out front with water & free treats. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I was here midday and the staff was friendly and helpful. I asked what she suggested and we went with doctors orders. It was great, fresh ingredients, good flavor, friendly service. Expensive, as you would guess though."}
{"text":"Service.... 8$ for a smoothie is high but I've been here before. It's Saturday in NoDa!!!! Why is that only one person working.... 15 minute wait for an 8$ smoothie = last time I come here."}
{"text":"The Juicebox truly is a much needed business in the heart of noda. This gives so much opportunity for those looking to get healthier a key edge to improve health and well being. Conveniently located adjacent to the ymca, it's great to grab a quality juice or smoothie after a vigorous work out. The place is clean, the staff and owner are pleasant and informative. I'm definitely coming back more,often. Highly recommendable to be part of your daily routine"}
{"text":"Huge fan of Juice Box! Love all of there options of smoothies and juices, however last time I was in there they were out of multiple ingredients needed for many of there options! Staff is wonderful, always happy and polite! Can't wait to go back and try something new!"}
{"text":"Best juice bar in Charlotte! Not only do they have delicious menu options, but the atmosphere is so inviting. I was able to have a relatable conversation with Kalik (hopefully I spelled that correctly), while receiving a delicious product. I will definitely recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times - either for a midday snack before working out or before/after I get my hair done since my salon is right by juice box. Nice to have a healthy option around a bunch of bars! Nice, clean ambience & the staff is very nice. There can be a bit of a wait depending on when you go though. I've had both the juices & smoothies and every one has been good but they are not very consistent. Sometimes my juices/smoothies don't taste the same as I've previously had or they can be really thick and hard to drink depending on who makes it. I'm sure if I went back they wouldn't mind remaking it but I'm usually short on time. They also offer a juice cleanse which my friend and I tried ~ GREAT price compared to other juice companies, I def plan on buying again once the seasons change."}
{"text":"So I've been here 3 times now and at best I can say it's hit or miss. The first time they we're out of coconut milk which is a main ingredient in a lot of their items so I left empty handed. The second time was great, everything in stock and came out as expected (smoothie and shot). This third time I came in for a smoothie bowl. I thought for sure I must have been given the snack bowl because well, it was so small and I didn't see some of the toppings it was supposed to come with. This time the service was also strange. It was just me and another couple and though I was first in line, the couple's smoothies were made first though when I asked if my order was forgotten, it was made before the couple paid for their smoothies and my payment was taken first.  I guess I would say proceed with caution and keep your expectations in check. It's within walking distance so I'm sure I'll be back at some point but maybe not as frequently as I would have hoped."}
{"text":"Paid $9 for the most expensive juice in Charlotte. It's more expensive than ritz carlton. Very small size around 24oz. Didn't even taste good enough."}
{"text":"They were out of bananas on their opening weekend- which was the main ingredient in the 3 smoothies I ordered- and the smoothies were very chunky- I had to add more liquid to it when I got home just to drink it. Also,  it was way overpriced- very expensive for what it is. I paid over $30 for three smoothies."}
{"text":"I thought juicing would be a fad that would be gone in a flash, like Crystal Pepsi or slap bracelets. To my surprise, it's stuck around and now I'm in the bandwagon.

I stopped in here late afternoon. I wasn't hungry enough to eat but I knew I wouldn't make it until dinner. The people here are very friendly. Always nice when you walk in and someone says \"Welcome!\".  This place is small but bright. The menu boards are pretty simple. They have some very basic juices and smoothies in the menu, so there's something for everyone.

I ordered the Hornet with jalapeño and the sweet greenery with Apple. The hornet tasted super green with a bit of a bite, while the sweet greenery had a nice taste of Apple and lemon to offset the green taste.

I think this is a pretty solid juice/smoothie place. It's located in the heart of NoDa and a great location to grab some greens while walking around the neighborhood. Not much seating so don't plan on getting a juice and staying a while."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and smoothies are good but it takes entirely too long. I have come 4-5 times now and rarely leave in under 25 minutes. The staff takes orders before they're ready to make the smoothie, then confuse who was there first making the concept of a line irrelevant. You will wait 30 minutes for an $8+ average smoothie\juice"}
{"text":"Fruits and vegetables have their place in this world.

Worst thing about fruits and vegetables? I hate them all.
Best thing about fruits and vegetables? They always can be juiced.

Right here, right now in NoDa, the Juice-box, offers healthy and fresh (100% raw, organic and locally-sourced) drinks and snacks for healthier lifestyle on the go.
- Fresh squeezed juices: I've tried few and my favorite was the \"Sweet Greenery\" then the \"Mills\" and I didn't like the \"Unbeetable\"-maybe I'm non a huge fan of beets.
- Smoothies.
- Essential Shots.
- Smoothie Bowls ($9.50): Berry Antioxidant Bowl, Vitamin C Bowl and Green Power Bowl.
- Snack Bowls ($4.50): Fruit Bowl with honey drizzle and Veggie Bowl with dash of pink Himalayan sea salt.

Definitely give JUICE BOX NoDa a try.
Three and Three Quarter Yelps."}
{"text":"What took NoDa so long to get a juice bar?! Finally!  I mean, what is more NoDa than a place that serves fresh pressed juices? 

This place is adorable. Everything is made with 100% natural fruits and veggies. They raw, organic, and locally sourced whenever possible. The lady behind the counter was super sweet. It was her first day back to work in awhile, and she was getting back into the swing of things. Really enjoyed talking to her. 

I was feeling run down and dropped in for a little pick me up. I decided on a Hornets pressed juice (jalapeño, kale, spinach, parsley, celery, cucumber, lemon) and an Energy Bull (coconut water, peppermint oil, and wild orange oil) essential shot. It was exactly what i needed. If you're not a fan of green juice, you probably wouldn't like the Hornets. I can't wait to try their Unbeetable and The Mills juices. 

Welcome to the neighborhood, you are a very welcome addition!"}
{"text":"Many months ago I had a green smoothie here and it was yummy. I decided to go back to buy a smoothie bowl and man, I want to support you guys, but you gotta get it together. First of all it smelled like sewage in the store. I was the only person in there and it took 15 minutes to get the 1 thing I ordered. I was given a very full bowl that I knew I would spill all over myself, so I asked for a napkin, and they said they were out. The smoothie bowl itself was tasty, but had way more granola and less fruit than I prefer.

I also don't know if there's an online ordering service or something, but a woman came in 10 minutes after I ordered and immediately got a smoothie that the employee made instead of first finishing mine."}
{"text":"I am so happy this juice bar opened right in the middle of NoDa! I love that is locally owned, not another chain juice bar. It's exactly what the neighborhood needed! I constantly find myself filling up on greasy bar food and alcohol living living and working in NoDa. Also being a vegetarian adds a great limitation to my meal options. Ever since they opened, I will stop in a a few times a week for  breakfast or lunch at the Juice Box. I usually get the Green Machine smoothie. It's made with spinach, kale, lemons, pineapple, banana, and coconut milk. It fills me up and gives me a great boost of energy. The employees are wonderful and friendly and I love the way the shop is decorated. They are a new business, I'm sure they are going to be adding more to the shop as it becomes more established. Hopefully some locally made Vegan snacks ;) I would definitely recommend supporting this business!"}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a juice bar. Fresh ingredients, perfect location!"}
{"text":"Today was very disappointing..my drink was super watery...the wait was ridiculous. This was my first time ever experiencing this level of dissatisfaction. The two employees seemed overwhelmed..the two ladies ahead of me mentioned how slow the service was today. I'm taking a break from here.."}
