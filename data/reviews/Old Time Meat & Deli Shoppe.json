{"text":"Best place around to buy quality meats.  I always go here when meat is to be the star of a meal.  Prime meats sometimes don't look quite as nice as I'd hope, but overall the product is far beyond any local supermarket."}
{"text":"Great butcher shop. Wonderful fresh pork, beef, and chicken -- and a small selection of fresh fish, which is something I was so happy to find in C-U. Small deli case with good Troyer meats. Lots of hams.  If you want some special cut or weird piece of the cow or pig, they will find it for you. Friendly, engaged staff."}
{"text":"I discovered Old Time several years ago and it is my favorite butcher shop to get meat.  I haven't tried Illini Meat but this place hasn't convinced me to leave yet.  They have a wide arrangement of marinated chicken, brine pork chops, ground beef, steaks, several types of bratwurst, and boars head deli.  They also carry all the sides that you could desire such as their in house smoked jerky and twice baked potato.  There are several weekly specials and the freezer section carries vacuumed sealed chicken and pork for those nights when you can't get to cooking the meat but still want a great fresh tasting frozen dinner."}
{"text":"This is definitely the place to go for excellent fresh meat and fish. I swear their Salmon is the very best in the area. You can't beat them. The staff is just as amazing. Always friendly welcoming and super helpful."}
{"text":"The prime cuts from here are so good, both my wife and I have become too \"spoiled\" to enjoy several of our former favorite steakhouses - preferring to stay home and cook these ourselves.

The staff are extremely knowledgeable and are willing to help with advice, getting a fresh cut, trimming to order, or anything else that might conceivably make you happier with them as a butcher.

I can not recommend this shop enough."}
{"text":"Old time has the BEST meat around.  Fresh and fabulous. 
And salmon is great.
Twice baked potatoes are awesome too. Going for baked smoked turkey this year."}
{"text":"Awesome butcher shop! I worked at the best family owned butcher shop in the Chicago area for many years and this shop is first class!  Awesome meat case with great steaks, marinated chicken and homemade sausage.  Friendly and helpful staff. I will stop back the next time I'm passing thru. Just wish they were open on Sunday so I could load up my cooler!"}
{"text":"I first went looking for a good butcher shop after getting sick of the poor quality meat found in grocery stores. Every piece of meat I've had here has been delicious. They also have fish and some interesting game meats, though I haven't tried either.

You can also get some lunch food here. If you are lucky enough to go by when they are smoking some meat in their outdoor pig-shaped grill, the smell is intoxicating. 

Their deli selection is small, but I find they have everything I need. The people here are very friendly, and you'll notice the same people working most of the time. It has a very nice local feel that beats going to a grocery chain hands down."}
{"text":"great selection and quality of product. The staff knows their product and their customers.  Truly gourmet items at reasonable prices"}
{"text":"i don't even know where to start with old time meat and deli because i have too many good things to say about it. 
absolutely delicious cuts of all sorts of meat? check.
employees who are helpful and actually know everything about their products? check.
the best yeast rolls i have ever found anywhere? check.
fresh bones for my dogs to chomp on? check.
and the list goes on.....
this is the only place in all of central illinois i will buy meat from. they get their meats and rolls (not deli meat) from local amish communities, and it is obvious that they take great pride in all that they sell.  every cut of meat i have had from here, whether it be ground chuck, a pork chop, spiral ham or rib-roast, has been absolutely amazing. and their bacon is to die for. the best bacon i have ever had. i'm drooling just thinking about it. yum.
if you think you've been buying great cuts of meat from a grocery store in the c-u area, i will tell you you haven't and that it's time you visit old time and see what a quality piece of meat tastes like. you will never be disappointed."}
{"text":"Everyone always looks at me like I'm crazy when I say I'm going to the butcher. Old Time is amazing. The meats are fresh (I had them cut a steak for me on the spot), and I love all of the Amish food that they have. I get all of my red meats from Old Time because you can really taste a difference. They also have great deals every week."}
{"text":"It's so nice to have a locally owned butcher. The customer service is outstanding and the prices are affordable. 

My favorites: 
Amish turkeys for thanksgiving (pre-order)... free range, affordable (for free range), and delicious! 
Fresh ground beef for very juicy burgers
Fresh sausage, especially the kielbasa which is heaven"}
{"text":"Top notch selection of quality meats and sides.

I've been here several times but stopped by yesterday for a quality birthday steak, a twice baked potato, and bacon.

I love the expertise of the employees here and the overall ambiance. It's second to none. Prices are comparable to the local grocery stores; quality is above and beyond what you can find elsewhere in the area (except maybe the U of I Meat Sciences Lab)."}
{"text":"I love this place! Staff is great very knowledgeable every cut of meat i have ever gotten has been top quality. Oh and did i mention the twice baked potatoes?!"}
{"text":"Great service every time! Prices are a little steep however the quality is top notch! They do run promos around holidays and offer packages for a bigger quantities!"}
{"text":"This place is the best.  The customer service is fantastic, the quality is terrific, and the prices reasonable.  If you need meat there is no better place in the area.  We do not buy much meat but when we do it is only from Old Time Meat and Deli!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for, and this Shoppe has an extra (e) for excellent cuts of meat.  If you'd rather grill than go to a restaurant, this is the place. Beef, pork, chicken, and fish, they've got it all. The potatoes are opposite the meat counter for the true Midwestern folks. Also, check out the freezer to the right of the front door for some delicacies you can't pass up."}
{"text":"Why did it take us so long to discover Old Time? It is amazing, I will never buy meat or fish at the supermarket again! I particularly like the knowledgeable staff, the smell of BBQ, and the extensive range of high quality products they sell. The best beef I have seen outside of Texas and New Zealand!"}
{"text":"Large variety of high quality fresh meat. The staff here are excellent at making a recommendation if you are unsure the difference between cuts. They also have other fresh items to complete your meal (twice baked potatoes are a must!) as well as frozen meats and \"Beef House\" rolls.

I only wish they were open Sunday's too!"}
{"text":"A heaven for meat lovers  !  Fresh products, clean facility, professional, friendly - and very knowledgable staff. Fairly affordable considering the superb quality."}
{"text":"WE LOVE(D) THIS PLACE.  And, I mean... who doesn't.  

Ever since we moved I've been lamenting the fact that I can't find a good butcher.  But, anything you need at Old Time, they can get it for you.  Even rare game, a lot of times.  Once, I had them get me some quail.  They also got me buffalo burger when I wanted it (and they weren't carrying it).  And the quality, too!  For the price you're paying at a Walmart, I mean... just skip it!  Never buy that nasty meat again.  Old Time'll do your 80/20 Chuck for your burgers, they'll do your bone-in ribeyes, they'll give you a pork butt, or shoulder!  I mean.. whatever.  For such reasonable prices, it's a wonder everyone doesn't shop there.

Oh wait, they do! =D  You can tell just by the parking lot.  There are two lots that sort of bump up to the front and side easements, but these lots are pretty small (like 7-12 cars per, I'd guess).  There are times you actually have to wait for a space to open up so you can park and run in.  And it's not unusual for someone to be all cattywampus in a space or NINE (I'm looking at you, SUVs =P), so!  Parking can be a bit tricky.

I wanted to mention that it's not all just fresh meat from their deli case, either!   They've got cheeses, desserts (frozen and fresh), OH, and the best part of all, I can't believe I almost forgot this!  They carry the Beef House rolls!  They're in the freezer section, in paper bags, but they're perfectly PERFECT.  Take a few home to keep in the freezer for when an uninvited guest shows up for dinner.  They'll praise your pastry prowess! ;D

Just pure, honest good stuffs, from some people who really know themselves some food!"}
{"text":"Really awesome deli here in town! The staff is friendly and the meats are delicious. They even have a neat assortment of odds and ends inside to explore as well. Definitely worth checking out as bbq season gets rolling!"}
{"text":"There's nothing I like more than a well marbled NY strip. OK - maybe a tender free range chicken. Any piece of meat I have purchased from Old Time has not let me down. Well, the Dietz & Watson deli meats are wonderful but still pale in comparison to Boar's Head (available at the IGA over on Mattis). It's all fresh, favorful and kosher! If your deep freezer is empty - you can save a ton when you buy in bulk.

It's the local butcher shop me and my fiancee had been waiting for. And after three years of being open for business, Old Time Meat & Deli is rarely crowded and I can never figure out why. It's a good thing for customers in the know..."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome!  Very fresh cuts of meat, great customer service, knowledgeable employees, what more can you ask for?!  They are always willing to go the extra mile here.  On one occasion, I bought meat for a stir fry, and the employee offered to cut up the meat for me without me even having to ask.  Another time I was looking for salmon fillets and the fish had just gotten there and one of the employees cut me a fillet.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I use this when I can't get to the Meat Science Lab. 

I've tried their ground chicken for some Mediterranean kebabs and found they only sell it frozen. That was a bit of a bummer, but when it was thawed it was a creepy chicken paste, nothing like I've ever seen.

They do have a good selection of meat in the deli case as well as some marinated items. When items are on special, they have some pretty great prices."}
{"text":"the staff is always amazing and the cuts of meat are even better.  personally I request the 2.5\" porterhouse ... and my wife gets the NY strips ... I simply have not found anything there I don't like.  fantastic establishment"}
{"text":"I'm almost reluctant to give it 5 stars only so it doesn't get super crowded! Every time I go in there, the staff greets me and gives me friendly attention. They are never pretentious and are always really willing to answer any questions. I came here looking for salmon and was really really impressed. You really have to come here to see what I mean. The meats are all super fresh (according to the guy who helped me, the salmon \"was probably swimming three days ago\". It certainly tasted like that.) It's a little expensive but you get what you pay for. 100%. For someone without much time to prepare the meat, they have pre-marinated cuts that look pretty good too."}
{"text":"This is a really good meat store, with some excellent marinated chicken choices too. All top quality meats  along with Amish chicken (it is delicious and not expensive). The staff is very helpful and friendly. They also have a small selection of fresh fish. I've had the cod and it was great. Also can recommend the pickles from the pickle barrel :)"}
{"text":"Olde Time is a carnivore's dream. They provide exceptional service and delicious meats. You can get just about anything to grill or smoke at this place. Prices aren't ridiculous, and chances are you'll have a nice conversation with one of the employees."}
{"text":"This is a quality butcher shop if you want to get quality meats. The hours, M-Sa 10-6 daily, are a bit more convenient than the Meat Lab. There is a large variety of top grade fresh cuts, marinated meats, smoked meats, sausages, kebabs, deli sandwiches, so many frozen offerings, etc. Where else can you find smoked chicken, cheese curds, and frog legs? They also offer hot bbq ribs and chicken if you're looking to pick up something for dinner. I've gotten some really good Porterhouse steaks here. I also like their pickled beets and fresh blocks of (super creamy) butter. If you're about to fire up the grill, they have wood chips, meat rubs, marinades, hot sauces... So many things."}
{"text":"I am thrilled to death that this place exists.  They have a wide variety of meat and cheese products, most (all?) of which is produced locally.  Furthermore, said meat and cheese products are *delicious*.  Frankly, I think for what you're getting, their prices are very fair.  I went in and bought a package of thick-cut bacon (which was heavenly, by the way), a very large cut of choice filet, a pound of virginia ham, a half pound of provolone, and some beef sticks, and only emerged about $30 lighter.  That's a pretty great deal."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an old-school butcher shop. With all the up-to-date spotless cleanliness then this place is for you.  If you are looking for a meat store that has premium cuts of meat a very large variety of meat to choose from whether your flavor is beef chicken or pork or whether you like seasoned Meats or deli meats then look no further. The staff is extremely knowledgeable friendly caring and strive to make your experience the best they can give advice about how to cook your meat so that you can get the best experience. Their prices are very reasonable. I have been too larger cities where you cannot get the quality that you can here. I do not post a lot of reviews because personally my opinion is mine and a lot of people don't tend to agree with it and who am I to stand out on a soapbox preaching to other people. But on the Rarity a place like this needs to be noticed I heard about it from Word of Mouth which is the best advertising money can't buy so if you're on here looking for advice what Deli to go to what meet up to go to you cannot fail here give it a try from there and ground turkey to their porterhouse steaks to their marinated chicken breasts which they have a large variety of you should really give the place a try."}
{"text":"Bright cheery, clean if only they carried pastrami and more pickle varieties otherwise it is all it says it is."}
{"text":"I am thoroughly impressed with Old Time Meat & Deli Shoppe. This place has the best selection of meat, chicken, and fish in Champaign. They also have the friendliest staff and a phenomenal selection of Boar's Head meats.

To top it off, $1 bags of huuuuge potato chips. They have all of your grilling necessities, frozen food, and pre-marinated meats. This place is a gem that has so much to offer for reasonable prices! Nothing better than their stuffed potatoes and cheese curds."}
{"text":"This place is THE BEST place to get meat in the C-U area.  Their staff is friendly and knowledable; it's just the kind of place you'd think would be packed in a place like Champaign.  Not only do they have a good selection of beef and pork, but you can pick up side dishes (and Beef House Rolls, win!).  They'll also cut you something special if you ask.  Definitely stop off on your way home via Neil Street and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best place for meat in town bar none. It reminds me of the butcher shops of old with the variety and quality of fresh selections. I especially like the fact they have their own smoker on site so I can get my Polish sausage fresh or smoked. I also like some of the great non-meat items on offer, including the Amish pickled baby beets and canned peaches. Service is friendly and attentive. Prices are not inexpensive but the quality is worth it."}
{"text":"I'm a student without a car and I walk a few miles round-trip and taking the bus just to come to Old Time for all my deli and meat needs. 

Though their selection is pretty extensive, ranging from USDA prime cuts, homemade plates, seafood, frozen stuff, a barrel of pickles, variety of cheeses, etc. The place has the family/homey vibe and that's what seems to set it apart from the very institutionalized food that students like me are used to on and close to campus. But I've matured enough in taste to realize that quality food usually doesn't come from Walmart or Meijer, and that the trek to Old Time is worth it even in the dead of winter for the friendly service, local feel, and most importantly, exceptional food.

I've had quite a few things from here, I particularly enjoy the deli roast beef and pepperoni. As far as meats go I'm a big fan of the petite sirloins and also the filets. I've got a couple crab cakes in the freezer that I haven't tried yet but look amazing. The large twice-baked or loaded potatoes are absolutely to die for! The only things I don't much care for here are the coleslaw and provolone cheese, the latter is the \"picante\" provolone and it isn't the same as what I get back home, it seems.

The prices to me are maybe a little higher than average, but you definitely get what you pay for in terms of quality and you know the money is in local hands. Quality and locality are two factors that I often consider to overshadow price and should be especially important aspects to anyone who cares about what they eat. 

Regardless, Old Time is the water in the figurative desert when it comes to having quality meat, seafood and other food items in the Champaign-Urbana area."}
{"text":"Knowledgeable, friendly staff.  Sirloin patties and the twice baked potatoes are my go-to choices here.  Will make a special trip for them.  Good stuff."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd review a butcher, but that's how good Old Time is. 
Top-notch ingredients. Excellent supplies for BBQ/smoking. 
The staff knows their stuff - I've walked in and said \"What am I in the mood to make this weekend?\" and they answer me thoroughly and don't look annoyed at all (which, honestly, they completely could because that's annoying of me to ask).
I'm kind of surprised they don't have better cheese, given how great everything else is, but I can't deduct for that."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever, and as a life-time local let me testify: Short of driving an hour out of town to one of the local farms in the surrounding towns, you will simply NOT find a better source of meet. Now those local farmers do come into town for our markets and they do stock their wares at the local Co-Op, but none of that feels like visiting a butcher. 

Combine old-school butchery with top-shelf customer service with the best of our local meat availability here conveniently in the center of town, and you get Old Time Meat & Deli Shop located at 2018 S Neil St. Champaign, Illinois 61820

Custom cut of meat? No problem. Availability during the holidays? Not an issue. Need advice on your next kitchen adventure? They got you covered. Just want some hot, tasty, smoked meat products? They have that too."}
{"text":"Although it smells incredibly smoky inside, many delicious high-quality cuts of meat await your arrival. 

Hot italian sausage. Do this now."}
{"text":"Super friendly people at this meat shop! Everyone is very helpful and they have such a wide variety of items. They also offer Boar's Head deli meats which are delish! I like that they also have some already made items like pork stuffed with wild rice and a large variety of marinated chicken breasts. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Aw, yeah! I never will go to County Market for my meat shopping again! Old Time can meet almost all of your meat eating needs and they do have a customer appreciation card where you get 10% off your next purchase when you purchase $200 worth at the store. Their sausages are quite good and their special flavors (applewursts you should try for sure!) change but they still have the classic bratwursts and mild and spicy italian sausage. Their flank steak is also good and their bulk italian sausage is also worth your while especially if you make spaghetti sauce from scratch. My complaint is that their hours and location could be better. Their staff is always helpful and they can help with getting special meat cuts."}
{"text":"As someone else said, I never thought I'd review a butcher but that's how much I like them!  Great food, friendly and helpful staff.  They also have fresh fish which is super convenient!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful butchershop. Deli selections limited to standards of ham, turkey, chicken with good selection of cheeses. Prices reasonable considering the quality."}
{"text":"Ye Old Time Meat and Deli Shoppe is one of the only places in champaign that I have no reservations about giving 5 stars.  It is SPOTLESSLY clean inside, and full of tip top meats!  The staff have always been nice and helpful when I've been there, and I'm pretty sure it's the only place in CU that has rack of lamb."}
