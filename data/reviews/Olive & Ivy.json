{"text":"Everytime we come here the service is great, the food is great, and we realize each time why we come here: there is nothing like it in town. If you haven't been here, you have to check it out, you will not have a better meal for this price point anywhere in town. I recommend it to everyone I know, and they all agree, this place is something special. Nice job, guys."}
{"text":"This place has a good, not overly complicated menu. I've tried the steak, salmon, chicken, and pork for dinner. All delicious, so I keep returning. The service is good and I love sitting out in the patio for dinner. One of my favorites in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Looking for some good Italian and this place is a home run!  Loved the sweet potato cannelloni. Kale salad was delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing food, beautiful patio (inside is super noisy) and the scallops are divine - I would second guess an evening there because if the service."}
{"text":"We were so impressed by this restaurant! We were visiting from out of town and we were so pleased that we stumbled upon Olive & Ivy.The decor was beautiful and the atmosphere was great! The bread and pesto is delicious! We got the marinara bruschetta and it was to die and the steak and the scallions were delicious!  Marissa was such a sweet server and she did a fantastic job at getting us exactly what we needed! Overall, super impressed and will go again when we are back in AZ!"}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere Lovedd the patio Good food and service the Mediterranean salad was very good  Be prepared to spend 50 plus per person for dinner"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time last night and LOVED it!  We had a reservation and were seated immediately in a really comfortable booth.  We liked the loud music, the atmosphere, and the energy of the place.  The location by the canal is so cool with the little bridge and all of the lights.  We split a butter lettuce salad (with avocado, bacon and perfectly ripe tomatoes)- it was delicious!  My husband had the scallops and I had the sweet potato cannelloni.  Both were fabulous and SO GOOD!  We had the peanut butter ice cream bar for dessert- the chocolate pretzel crust was very yummy.  Our service was absolutely perfect- Martin was very friendly, very helpful, and his visits to our table were perfectly timed.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The ambience is very good, a great place to have lunch with an interesting menu, well trained staff and excellent service. The wine list is also very good and complements the menu - has obviously been well thought out. The restaurant has a struggle with the changeover from lunch to dinner  - which I don't understand."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Got the lasagna and the lamb gyro.... very good!"}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance. Nice open space. 2 patios, ample bar, friendly waitstaff. If you are looking for a casual but nice ambiance, then this place may be for you. However, I sat at the bar, and I was the only one there. It seemed that the bartender was more interested in prepping the bar for higher volume than even seeing if i needed more bread or having any conversation at all. I felt more like a nuisance than a paying customer. He served me some very old wine which he promptly changed out when I complained. As for the food, I ordered three pieces of bruschetta bread and one glass of wine. Those two items came up to be over $30. I could imagine paying as much if I were getting top-notch service with exceptional food, but the food was hastily put together and while somewhat flavorful, I would have paid $5 instead of $30!  I am CERTAIN that this place is severely overpriced."}
{"text":"Solid lunch spot, a little on the pricey side but classy enough to be ok."}
{"text":"I've been to nearly all the Fox Restaurants, and this one is my fav."}
{"text":"Usually this place is good but today I had a bad experience. I understand it was busy for Sunday brunch and I'm very laid back and understand when it gets busy...things happen...I get it.  My girlfriend and I sat at the bar. (The bar tenders were both very friendly.) We waited 45 minutes to get our food and when it arrived the order wasn't correct.  My girlfriend ordered the vegetable scramble and it came out with a slice of unmelted provolone clumped on one side of her eggs. Apparently, they had keyed the order in incorrectly and asked us just before the food arrived about her order, so I suspect they threw the cheese on last minute to salvage the order.  The medium rare burger I ordered was well done. In hindsight, we should have said something, but we were starving by that point."}
{"text":"We were seated over a half an hour after our resevation to start. The apps were great dates in bacon were amazing as was the flatbread. The entered however were not as good. My fish was so salty I felt my blood pressure spike! Even the salad that came on the side was too salty to eat. I have never spoken up about something like that before but it was do bad I had to. They seemed concerned asked if I wanted to order something else but I was done at that point. I was stunned that they didn't comp something on our bill they still charged us- not even a wine comp. I wasn't going to force the issue but won't go back."}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy was a lifesaver during a hectic night.  We flew out of Phoenix to San Diego, only to fly around for 2 hours and return back to Phoenix due to heavy fog in San Diego.  So, we were stuck overnight in Phoenix.  We didn't bother staying at a hotel due to the long waiting time in arranging that and an early rescheduled flight the next morning.  That's when we came across Olive & Ivy around 10:45PM.  Thank goodness they stay open late.  And we were able to have a healthy and delicious dinner.  We got the Italian sandwich, turkey sandwich, and the Olive & Ivy salad (highly recommended).  The dining area has outlets at every table, and there is free wifi in the Phoenix Airport.  Even after Olive & Ivy closed, the wonderful staff let us stay in the dining area as they cleaned up.  At the end of the night, they even gave us bags of free Snickerdoodles.  The staff went above and beyond to make our miserable night in the airport a bit better."}
{"text":"Great server bad food. Steak cooked correctly but served with a lot of salty sauce. Side of creamed spinach inedible, more garlic than anything. Kicker is I was offered 50% off my meal. Unrealistic solution, actually insulting.  Either comp it or just apologize don' offer a weird discount."}
{"text":"Very cool place! Dinner was excellent and the service was awesome! We sat on the patio which is by far the way to go at this restaurant. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy...Ambiance is fantastic. Just walking in you feel like you are in a place to enjoy friends, drinks and good food. The outside seating area is actually my favorite. Although it can be hot in the summer evenings it's totally worth dealing with the heat. I gave this place 3 stars because of 1 thing. I ordered the veal raviolis when I was there. The taste was great, but for $18 the portion was more like a small appetizer. That was a bummer to say the least. I left there and had to get something else to eat later which I just don't do. Bump up the portions guys...then I give the place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Grabbed a salad from here before a flight out, and so glad I did. I got the Mediterranean (couscous, tomatoes, feta, almonds, cucumbers, mixed greens, vinaigrette dressing) and added pulled chicken to it. Was really impressed by how good it was, and it was so big I ate half before my flight and thought I'd save the other half for the flight - ended it up bringing it all the way home and into work for lunch the next day (yes, it was kind of a hassle, but it was that good). Service was super friendly, too.  Pasta salad wasn't great (but then again I don't like mayo and forgot to read the ingredients) but was about half veggies, which I appreciated.   Overall, I'd seek this place out next time I fly into or through Phoenix."}
{"text":"First table they gave us was in front of the band.  Why have a band blasting at like 7PM on a friday night?  No one goes here to dance, they come here for dinner.  We are a young couple and like music, but it was so loud we couldn't converse.  Totally inappropriate for the atmosphere. We told the waiter we were leaving.  Instead, he said he could get us a quiet table.  He found us a spot in the marketplace, which although it felt like a closet, it was at least a calm closet.  We had glasses of wine (reasonably priced), I had a kale salad which was amazing (first time ive liked kale to be honest), and my gf had some kind of fish dish.  Good food!  Like it.  Ditch the band."}
{"text":"It's an upscale casual restaurant with nice decor- 4 star, a quick meal before or after shopping. A quick meal means only if you get good sever plus quick service.  We went to have brunch on Sunday and it was pretty packed in there. After looked at their simple brunch menu, we decided to get Grilled Hanger Steak with Scrambled Eggs, and Cinnamon French Toast with Fruit Compote & Syrup($8.50).   It wasn't too impressive, the food was just ok- 3 Star. I think you pay more for the ambiance than the dishes. The service was alright- 3 Star.  It felt like you are in the market with chit chat and bargain noise, which i thought it was kinda annoying."}
{"text":"Dined here on Saturday night, just happened to have a gift card and wanted to use it. Of course, it being a spring night here in Arizona we wanted to be on the patio. Ordered a round of martini's to start the night off. First mistake - they gave us the martini in a lowball glass with straws. The server said they were short on martini glasses. Seriously? The martini itself was an equivalent of a juice box. (We measure our martinis against our own or AZ88's).   We started off with the calamari - a little rubbery (undercooked) but okay. Not sure why they pair it with zucchini (filler).  D had a filet mignon - he said it was okay. I had the Sausage Flatbread, I smothered the leftover pesto from the bread dipping on the pizza to kick it up a notch. The toppings weren't spread evenly the corner pieces were bare of toppings.  The atmosphere was very noisy and few waiters that were easy on the eyes. Our server was very attentive. Didn't really enjoy sitting right next to a family and I don't think they enjoyed sitting next to a gay couple.  I give this place a \"meh\". Location is about the only thing it has going for it."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and well designed space. Loved the food: roasted artichoke hearts app, Brussels sprouts bruschetta and short rib flat bread. I have a feeling anything they do out of this kitchen is awesome! I realized this is a very subjective opinion but coming from LA this place exceeded my expectations and that goes for the service as well."}
{"text":"I love this place. Atmosphere and their ridiculously pricey drinks. food is great and it is a fun place to come with friends and grab drinks and be social."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here several times, but the last time we had dinner here the food was disappointing. The portions were very small. For example, my wife had the chicken breast and what came out was 1/2 a chicken breast and some shredded dark meat hidden beneath it. Very odd. I also ordered some bruschetta, and it was about as big as a $1 bill. Needless to say, we probably won't be returning for dinner. The service was great, however, and we'd still consider coming back for a drink at the bar."}
{"text":"Food was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing. The atmosphere was beautiful. The service was decent. I'd definitely eat there."}
{"text":"Went to Olive & Ivy for dinner tonight while on vacation and can't wait to return. Great atmosphere, incredible staff and delicious food! Started with a grapefruit mojito - this is a must have if you like mojitos. Had the bacon wrapped dates, the sea scallops, and the graham cracker gelato. Would recommend all of them! Our waiter was very nice and brought extra bread for my 9-year-old. The homemade pesto is some of the best I've ever had. Everything is made in house. Really wish I lived in Scottsdale so I could eat there once a week!"}
{"text":"Over priced for small servings of food.  But the food is delicious, the patio is great in the evenings or the winter, and the ambiance overall is nice."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. The food is always amazing and nothing disappoints. I will drive out of my way to get the mediteranian salad with cold chicken and the bread/pesto app."}
{"text":"Best patio in Scottsdale hands down. Always exceptional service and food. Had the breakfast burrito during lunch and I loved it. Ryan my server was very pleasant and accommodating."}
{"text":"Way overrated from a food prospective but good for MILF hunting if your into that kind of thing. If your looking for a great meal take a pass but if your into people watching this place is a 10!"}
{"text":"We went back to Olive and Ivy last night for the first time since our bad experience on New Years Eve. This time was much better! Our waiter was wonderful, service was great, food was delicious. We look forward to returning again!"}
{"text":"Incredible food (especially the pesto!) with an unbeatable location. On top of that, the bar and decor are beautiful; the lighting will make you feel like you've stepped out of Scottsdale and into Hogwarts!! Visually satisfying to say the last. However, the food is a little pricy, and the restaurant and bar can get a little crowded."}
{"text":"Yum! A group of us visited Olive & Ivy on a Saturday afternoon, maybe around 2:45. Despite having a large group, we were able to quickly get a table outside. The outside area has an awesome vibe, with plenty of shade, as well as misters and string lights, and good music.   As far as food, my husband and I shared a piccante flatbread and a chopped chicken salad. Both were delicious! The salad had granola in it, which sounds weird but actually added some good texture to it, and the flatbread overall was really satisfying. The complimentary pesto and bread was super yummy too! Everyone in our party raved about the food.   My only complaint was that service was pretty slow. Drinks took a really long time and were all given to the wrong people when they did come out, and the bread didn't come out until our orders did. Thankfully, we weren't in a rush, so we were able to just chill and enjoy ourselves, but it was surprising since the restaurant didn't seem overly busy at that time."}
{"text":"We had an important of town business associate to dine with. Wanting to sell him on Scottsdale and the vibe of Old Town, we chose Olive & Ivy. Not our fist visit and certainly will not be our last. Dinner was fantastic and our server even more professional. Needles to say, our meals were all delicious and we made a great impression. Four Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went back with a couple of girl buddies.(yes, I gave in even when I said I wouldn't); seated on the patio, service excellent as before, food much better this time around, but stuck with lunch stuff."}
{"text":"Great place, classy, the outdoor is amazing when the weather is nice and not too hot. The atmosphere is great and the food is good too. I think the food portion size is very small though for the money they charge and i wish they had more variety"}
{"text":"The coffee here is pretty bad and they use plastic lids you can taste. Please wash the carafes. If you have time try cartel instead."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, service, wine, and food were all superb! I strongly recommend sitting out on the misty patio by the water and enjoying a glass (or more) of chardonnay with watermelon salad and fresh chicken! I'm returning for round two, today! Wonderful experience and food was cooked, prepared, and served to perfection!"}
{"text":"This was a tough call. I reallllllllllly wanted to give it four stars. I mean the place is gorgeous. Great bar area, great dinner area, and the outside deck is just gorgeous....the bad part was the service. We were there on a Friday night and there were only four of us in our party. I think there may have been a total of 12 people in the whole place. And yet our waitress only came over to us once. And we ordered a lot of drinks that night. It was her loss. We had to keep walking up to the bar for our service. It was a very comfortable place. I haven't eaten there yet but I'd like to go back there for people watching and dinner perhaps."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday afternoon/evening right after work for happy hour.  My wife had been given a gift card for her birthday for the Fox restaurants, so we decided to spend it here.  The happy hour is very underrated, and I'm not sure why we don't go more often.  Wines are half off, both by the glass and by the bottle.  Cocktails are a couple dollars off, and beers might be half off as well.  We've had the cocktails before, and they are solid - not my favorites, but strong, well made and tasty.  This time, we opted for a bottle of wine - not a bad deal at half off - ended up being a $15 bottle of Reisling.  My wife is still figuring out which wines she likes so she asked for advice in picking one out - the bartender made a recommendation, and then poured her a sample to try before we committed.  She liked it, so he went and got us a fresh bottle to share.    The appetizers and flat breads are also half off during happy hour.  We had the bruschetta - quite tasty, although it seemed like it was served on wheat toast, nothing overly inspired.  Had the prosciutto etc been served on a more intriguing bread...it would have been perfect.  Also, the fried calamari was tasty and light and cooked perfectly.    If they don't bring you some of their fresh made foccacia and pesto dipping oil...ask for it.  It was the absolute highlight for us.    All in all, good drinks, good food, service is great...and the happy hour prices are very reasonable.  My only tip - get there early if possible if you want elbow room.  The bar area seems to fill up pretty quickly - by the time we were leaving (6pm-ish) we had people hovering waiting for a spot at the bar."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant. My only disappointment is that I live in Los Angeles and can't eat here more often. Had the bruschetta, turkey sandwich, and the lamb gyro. All were delicious. The staff could not have been better. One of the managers, Josh, was so on top of everything.I felt my pita wasn't grilled enough. Before I could finish my request to the waiter,Josh had picked up my plate and regrilled my pita. A diner slipped and fell and Josh was there immediately to help. We sat at common table facing the open kitchen.What a treat. Our waiter Nathan couldn't have been more attentive.Jim the food expediter was so nice and explained the dishes. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This resto has \"meal of your life\" potential! To start, the bread and pesto is to die for. I ordered the half caesar salad, and my loving girlfriend had the half beet salad. Both were nice presentations and incredibly tasty. For main I had the goat cheese tortelli. Will not lie, one of the best meals ever. The duck confit was cooked to perfection. Very tasty and well worth the price. GF had lasagna, and it was just as good as the tortelli. Highly recommend this place...will return!"}
{"text":"Absolutely original and delish. All Fox restaurants are great."}
{"text":"The most amazing experience. Beautiful and unique decor and phenomenal staff. The food is unique and has amazing flavor! Also, very fun drinks and a million places to sit :)"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and it's a good thing b/c the hostesses kind of sucked.  Our 45 minute wait took almost 2 hours and the snotty high schoolers working the hostess stand almost caught a piece of my mind.  But thankfully the food and service made up for it.  I'd say go earlier or later to avoid some of the rush, especially as the bar area gets jam packed."}
{"text":"I wish there was a half star, because truly I would give it 3.5. The food is good. The ambiance is good, but the service...meh.  The reason I go...The beet salad. THE BEST in the Valley I have tasted. The pistachios and arugula with goat cheese? Diiiiiiivine. But, truth be told, if they took it off the menu, I would never come back. Still. xoxo"}
{"text":"Terrific ambience and meal Wait staff was very attentive This was our second visit in 1 month"}
{"text":"Still a solid choice  Met a friend for lunch during the busy shopping season.   We sat outside and our waiter was happy to put the heater on for us, very accommodating.  Had the flatbread, which was great as usual.  My friend had the salmon caesar salad, which she said was amazing.  Service was solid, as was the food.  I would love to see some new items on the menu, it seems a little boring if you go there every few months.  Good food and solid service, a very safe choice for dinner and for taking out-of-town guests there."}
{"text":"Terrific place for a quick bite before or between flights.  One less star because the pizza slice was stone cold, but still tasty.  On the floor \"servers\" were outstanding."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast, super good. I get the standard bacon, eggs and potatoes. They sub the toast for berries, and boy are they delicious. Super crispy and fresh. Eggs are to order ( over easy for me) bacon is generous and potatoes just right, not overdone. All for 8 bucks. Top spot in my book!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and creative menu! 3.5/5  I went there about a year ago for S's birthday. A big group of us were seated at the patio outside. The atmosphere was great. I like the menu a lot. I remember the food was good but not very spectacular (when considered the price tag...). I only have it a low 4 because of its service. We had poor service that day! I hope the situation has improved since then. I will check back and report out again!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Scottsdale when looking for a fantastic outdoor dining atmosphere. It has such a beautiful patio with nice trees, comfortable seating, firepits and heaters for the chilly nights, all while overlooking the Scottsdale Waterfront. Wonderful to enjoy a glass of wine or a great meal. My favorite entree is the Tuna! Excited to go back soon!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fantastic. The view of the river is amazing and adds to the overall dining experience. The food is good, but nothing to write home about. I ordered the breakfast sandwich which came with home fries. The breakfast sandwich was delicous. I also ordered a cheese danish which was noteworthy. I really enjoyed visiting the restaurants bathroom. The bathroom was beautifully decorated with large floor to ceiling doors and externally comfortable. The service was fantastic. I will definitely return next time I am in the area. If I could I would have given four and half stars."}
{"text":"Beautiful beautiful beautiful!!! Service was fantastic! We ordered shrimp risotto, sea bass w/cauliflower and the Scallops and polenta.  Yummy!!  What a fantastic dinner!!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Olive & Ivy in the Phoenix airport in terminal A. We had  just came off the red eye from Lithue Hawaii and what a surprise this restaurant was. From the cook taking our order and customizing it for us, to the front of the house  manager walking around picking up our finished items along with a bus boy, it was a relief to have such great service after having had not much sleep. The food was delicious too, and I don't mean just for airport food. The trafitional breakfast with eggs bacon potatoes and toast was pretty standard but the breakfast club hit the spot. The staff was so unbelievably nice and cheerful it was such a nice change from the normal airport routine. It was a good fast food but full service combo in a bistro type setting. Stop by here when you pass rough the Phoenix airport!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best restaurant in the valley! Worth every spent here- for the lovely staff, great ambience and excellent food!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite restaurants in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  Ever since I've moved here for school, I've always come here with my fiance, friends, or out of town guests.  The food never disappoints.  MUST try their tuna tartare in \"taco\" shells.  It is DELICIOUS OMG.  They make an awesome red sangria.  Their ahi tuna steak and sea bass are DELICIOUS!  Also, I've tried their featured specials from time to time and they are always yummy.  Overall, great restaurant.  On the weekends, they have a live DJ so it really makes it a great dining experience and they have a nice open air atmosphere with tables on the terrace facing the canal.  Service is always great here.  MUST EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Later. Wow. If the mood is right, or maybe even if it is not, this place is right.  Sweet potato cannelloni with roasted mushrooms and toasted almonds.  Like having a healthy dessert for lunch.  Wow.  Got one to go for later on at home.  It was that tasty.  Also artichoke appetizer, bruschetta, all very strong.  4 to 4 and 1/2 stars.  Open-air decor, eat inside or out next to \"waterfront canal\" (CAP water that people used to water-ski on decades ago, towed by a pick-up truck).  Not to detract from the review, but this is \"desert-rat style waterfront\" all dressed up in Scottsdale fashion - but that is the city's doing, not Fox's or Olive & Ivy's.  The restaurant decor and atmosphere are great.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We have been there many times but last night it was an awe full experience. We got a Bald waiter that didn't even tell us his stupid name and he didnt even serve us with water, utensils, the food was late and he forgot to bring ketchup, or any extra that we requested. He was serving his friends that were sitting beside us and they told us that they are friends with this idiot Bald waiter. After we paid, I talked to the manager who ignored us and told us to call him next time to reserve a place, as if he is going to do anything special. I told him that I called and reserve before hand and he just blindly ignored. I would not recommend anyone there."}
{"text":"Before I lived in PV, I use to drive from Flagstaff (2.5 hrs away) just to come and visit this restaurant! The pesto and bread is amazing! Then, the friendliest staff, is just a pleasure to be waited from, comes to the table, full of information, to take your order. I've eaten just about everything and if not me, the people I've recommended to come, have, all saying that this place has great food for the price. I love the sweet potato cannelloni with spinach and mushrooms. It's so different but so so tasty. Also, being right next to the water, the outside patio is gorgeous and old Town Scottsdale is right behind them. I hope this helps you make up your mind for a great lunch or dinner experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and ambience! I started with the bacon wrapped dates and then had the sweet potato canneloni. Both excellent choices, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Shrimp risotto was really quite mediocre - grainy. Service was a little cold. The Fritto Miso was too oily..  The lamb meatballs were quite good.  The Pacific Bass was only OK - but the vegetables were great with it. The bread and pesto were the best flavors of the night."}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy has the best salad in the Scottsdale Fashion Square area.  The people that work in the Market Place are awesome!  Keep up the great work. :)"}
{"text":"Piece of melted plastic in my Lasagna, very bummed. I would have said this is my least favorite Fox Concept restaurant."}
{"text":"We were a party of 6 celebrating my wife birthday . We have never been in this  resturant before . The resturant atmosphere  was  awesome . We got seated at the patio .The foods were exelent,good quality  ,well presented and good  portion.The reasons behind giving this restaurant a three starts are  1- the pesone who I talked to make the reservation at 9:15 didn't mentioned that the kitchen closing at 10 ,so we got rushed and we didn't have enough time to enjoy having  our salad . 2- The waitrest that she was taking care of us was not friendly and doest have any kind of customer service skills . I understand she might be tired but I don't think one smile would be hard to be expressed . 3-   After we finished the dinner,we asked her to bring a cake in order celebrate my wife birthday .She said there is 2 $ fees will be charged per person .  It kind of wired , our check is 200$ and they still asking us to pay\" fees \". There no value of the 2$  in these days and if I paid it will not  affect to my budget BUT it's all about principles and customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"I hve to admit, I never had a salad as good this place. The chicken in it was at its perfection. It was a pleasure dining here."}
{"text":"Absolutely atrocious. Empty wine glass and forgotten entree. This place is an embarrassment.  My party is done and I'm here waiting for my dinner or at least a drink maybe an apology but nothing."}
{"text":"More corporate giant than quaint gem.  Nice patio.  Good but spendy entrees for the portion size.  Desserts are great value.  Scripted (versus engaged) service.  Visited on 3/09 based on several coworkers' recommendations.  Surprised to see it was in a giant shopping mall.  A quick Google revealed its one of a vast number of concepts in the parent company's portfolio (many of them also in the same mall.). With that as our expectation mindset, we were promptly seated on the patio at our reservation time.  House made foccacia was more like Wonder bread than real bread. Ordered entrees.  Sea bass and duck/goat cheese tortellini.  Very tasty but surprisingly expensive.  (Mall rent?). Wine list expectations were misled by the giant wall of bottles at the entrance.  Turns out most of those are empty and purely a facade.  Did order a couple glasses that were decent.  Waitor was minimally useful with his recommendations.  (\"It all depends what you like.  They're all good.\")  Ordered two desserts.  Brown butter cake and ice cream bar.  Both were excellent and a good value at $5 each.  Waiter was not familiar with them though and struggled to describe the ice cream bar.  Bottom line.  Fair meal.  Lived up to our \"large company mall restaurant\" expectations.  Excellent patio."}
{"text":"Really great restaurant.  Went alone and sat at the bar.  Excellent service. Engaging staff and fabulous food."}
{"text":"I have been here many many times and every time the food has consistently been great, however, the staff is off and on. The last few times we have gone, our servers has been extremely uppity. Last time, our server rudely corrected my pronunciation of a word while interrupting my order, this time, our server kept giving me the stink eye each time he passed us. I even witnessed him give the lady at the next table over a mean face as she walked away after he saw what she tipped him. Then, a bird pooped on our table (we were on the patio) and when I mentioned it to him he didn't even come back with a cloth to wipe it off. We lost our appetite and left.  I'd honestly rather eat at a place where I feel welcomed."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time here, so I knew what to expect.  there were 3 of us women & we went for lunch on a Wed.  We were seated immediately & given menus & water.  But no drink order was taken.  When our waiter arrived - same thing - he brought bread & pesto - after being asked.  But didn't ask for a drink order.  Brought out the bread - still no order.  Came back out & took our food order, but...you get the idea.  We shared the 3-bruchetta combo which was fresh & tasty.  I had the chopped chicken salad which was just OK.  Too much dressing on it which overpowered the tender chicken & the yummy, crunchy peanut granola on top.  The table was cleared & cleaned but we were never offered dessert or cookies, pastries, gelato, etc.  Our waiter kindly split our tab 3 ways...which would have been much bigger...had he ever offered us drinks or dessert.  Decent food but if I want average, offhand serivce, I can stay in Chandler & go to Chili's and spent a lot less $$$."}
{"text":"Amazing a must try if you are in the area, food was amazing we ordered the flatbreads withe the mushroom and one with the corn and goat cheese and the Mediterranean salad and loved it all , try this place you won't regret it one of the better flat breads we ever had and the salad was to die for. The service was friendly and great."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, kind of an upscale casual yet keeping it very sophisticated. Food was excellent, I loved their wine selection...something for everyone palette and budget. Give Happy Hour a try, we did and it was divine."}
{"text":"The favorite Phoenix area restaurant of my wife and mine! A scratch kitchen, you are guaranteed to have fresh ingredients and an incredible ambiance. The patio setting is beautiful. We love the bruschettas, fresh bread, and I always get the natural chicken. The service is always top-tier. And the marketplace has a great variety as well. The breakfast sandwich with avocado is so good and you can even pick that up at the airport location for literally the best airport meal you'll ever have!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome, atmosphere was awesome. Went with my daughter and we loved it. Only wish there was one in Denver."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast/lunch spot in Scottsdale. The food at the market shop counter is fabulous. The fruit and yogurt parfait is the best. And you can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches/salads. Make sure to end with a gelato. A must stop everytime we're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I come to Olive & Ivy at least once a week for their Mediterranean Salad. I'll usually add the cold chicken although I've had the grilled as well. Either way, this never disappoints. It's a good sized portion enough to fill me up for lunch."}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy is a great Sunday brunch spot with good service and decent menu options.  The prices are better if you leave the kids at home and the morning cocktail options are a little on the pricey side.  If you're looking for delicious cups of goodness the cinnamon roll latte is to-die-for and fantastic followed by their killer french toast!  Health nuts won't be disappointed with egg white and veggetarian options, so have no fear!  All around great brunch spot, just slightly slow on service, and a tad bit pricey."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio with our family.  It was a wonderful time. The patio seating is so comfortable with big plush cushions.  The sound of the fountain and the glow of the lights made it such a peaceful time (except when our 3 year old fell in the fountain). The food was great, especially the two kinds of bruschettas.  Our server was sweet and helpful.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We were here with a larger party, and the server continuously tried to up-sell us on different items. It began to get a little annoying.  The food was good, but the portions were tiny. I think most people at the table (except for the person who ordered the flatbread) finished their meal and were still hungry. Luckily we ordered lots of desserts to fill our bellies!  We probably wouldn't return unless the idea was initiated by someone else."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here last night for the first time. We entered through the gelato side, not knowing where the dinner hostess was located. The girl working the gelato bar immediately greeted us and escorted us to the proper side. What happens next is what really irritated me. As we were walking towards the hostess stand there were two girls staring at us blankly. No \"welcome!, how many?, how can we help you?\"...nothing. I'm sorry but if you are in your 20s, you should know how to greet guests when they walk into a restaurant. I'd recommend some better training for the hostesses.   Other than that...our waiter was friendly and our food was great. The veal and spinach ravioli was the best I ever had."}
{"text":"I have no idea why all these people are giving Olive and Ivy 5 stars.   Olive and Ivy has 2 good things going for them: gorgeous decor and trendy atmosphere.  And a possible 3rd: good wine list.  The bad things far outweigh these.  We went with a group of 10 friends on a Tuesday night.  First of all, I was not impressed with the menu.  It was expensive and I could hardly find a few things I actually wanted to order.  I ended up ordering the fig and prosciutto flatbread because I had to leave earlier than the rest of our group.  The service was TERRIBLE.  45 minutes went by before my food arrived.  For flatbread!  I had 10 minutes to scarf it down before I had to leave.  I have no idea why the service to a group of 10 could be so terrible on a Tuesday night.  I could understand if it was busy, but it was just poor service.  Turns out the flatbread was mediocre...I didn't even take my leftovers.  Would I return?  Maybe to sit at the bar and have a glass of wine.  But definitely not for dinner.  Too many other good restaurants in Scottsdale that are worth the price.  Very disappointing for Fox Restaurants."}
{"text":"The pesto!!!! So good. The place has a good atmosphere and delicious food. I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine. Everything I've tried on the menu from the three times I've gone has been delicious. Slightly pricy but not terrible for Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Ordered a simple grilled cheese and asked for no tomato and if I could add ham. Paid additional for the ham, as expected and was completely fine with that. However, it took a very long time (10 minutes at least) when there was only 2 other orders being processed. The first sandwich came out with tomato (asked for no tomato) and without Ham (paid extra to add it). Asked politely for correction and they said no problem. She took my sandwich from me and did not visibly throw it out. My second sandwich was surprisingly faster... But still no ham! Asked the manager of he could just give me a couple slices of ham while I showed the receipt. I was given 2 very thin slices of ham that didn't even cover both sides of the sandwich. He apologized briefly but did not offer anything else for the inconvenience. Sandwich was cold at this point. Very disappointed!!! Sandwich was okay, but surely nothing special!"}
{"text":"I took my son here for his birthday.  It was just mom and son time.  The place was okay.  Nothing to write home about about.  When I made the reservation, they could have said they do not serve a full menu till 5:00. We were only aloud to order off the appetizer and pasta menu.  I will give this place another sometime but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great wines, great food and great service.   Highly recommend the beet salad, prosciutto small plate and ahi main course.  The atmosphere is casual, yet lively with lots of great food and wine options.  Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"So, I had a work lunch here earlier this week (this being a Tuesday, I guess it was yesterday!) and was a bit unimpressed.  Obviously, a great location and you can't beat a seat on the patio for happy hour, but it just wasn't great (and I'm a big Sam Fox fan!).  First, our waitress was a bit off - just off on timing, her explanations, a whole host of things, but she did do a good job keeping up with the pony keg of iced tea we all drank! The food was ehhh...decent. We started with the calamari (which I don't love so nothing held against O&I on that one... although the fried zucch's were a nice addition) and then I had the chopped chicken salad. It was good, but nothing to really get excited about and it had a strange peanut-brittle topping that seemed to be kind of out of place.   As for the rest of the guests, one sent his ravioli's back and got the same salad I had as he said the rav's were not good. The others (french dip sandwich, gnocchi and a flatbread) were all a bit underwhelmed.   I have been here many times before and have found it to be pretty inconsistent. I definitely prefer dinner to lunch , especially based on this last experience and again, it's pretty solid for happy hour especially with the awesome people watching...the weekly Cougar convention!  Ironically, I will be back tomorrow....wish me luck!"}
{"text":"Great spot to escape the bustle of the mall. Really good salads and flatbreads. Sit on the patio if you can."}
{"text":"Update: OK. So, I still haven't returned to Olive & Ivy except to fetch a bottle of water for my wife during a nice stroll around the canal. But I run by the place almost every morning and started to think I was being unfair - and, perhaps, a little juvenile, in my review. Forget about the Grilled Cheese Incident. But the rest of it - snooty wait staff attitude, included - should be given the weight you deem appropriate. Cheers.   ===============================  It's two pieces of bread and some cheese ... maybe some butter. It's a grilled cheese, of course, and, it turns out, you can't get one at this place. That may not be surprising given the upscale nature of Olive & Ivy. But it's on the menu. The menu it's on just happens to be in the adjoining marketplace. But what does that matter when we're talking about a lousy grilled cheese sandwich. If that were only it, though.   Not long ago, I joined my wife and a friend for a few drinks and what likely would have transitioned into dinner. We sat in the bar area after being initially and erroneously told that food was unavailable on their fabulous patio. Our bar server told us otherwise and we were soon relaxing next to a roaring blaze outside. Problem One: Solved. Unfortunately, it was replaced by Problem Two: Our server.  As it turns out, the young lady apparently didn't think highly of us sitting on the patio. After all, she had to schlep 20 or 25 extra yards to help us. We tried to make it up to her with a little self-deprecating humor, offering that she \"probably hated us for sitting\" outside but we were good tippers. She grimaced and forced out a laugh. Whatever. What do you want for $15 glasses of wine and $8 beers? Speaking of beer ... Problem Three: Beer selection.   Olive & Ivy has, apparently, thousands of bottles of wine. I mean, the bottles reach the ceiling and keep going. Very impressive ... if you drink wine. I, as you may know, do not. I drink beer. And I'm not embarrassed to say so. In fact, I pretty much drink one beer --- Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. That they did not have. Well, they had it in the marketplace but not on the beverage list. (Yes, I did consider buying the six pack of Sierra in the marketplace and bringing it outside to the patio. It was only $2.50 a beer. But like I said, this was a pretty upscale place.)  There were the usual suspects: Coors or Corona or whatever. But then there were some other, European offerings, one which I chose and enjoyed. Nevertheless, it continues to amaze me that restaurateurs spend tens of thousands --- maybe even hundreds of thousands --- of dollars on wine inventory and the like, but can't manage to get the distributor to throw in an extra couple of cases of acceptable beer. A shame, to be sure. Anyway, Problem Three: Solved, more or less. But this is where it all devolves. So, back to Problem Two: Our server.  We enjoyed drinks and a terrific flatbread appetizer before finally succumbing to the server's constant barrage of dinner offerings. The girls placed their orders without challenge. Me? I wanted a grilled cheese. So, I asked for one. It seemed simple enough. The server shot back that a grilled cheese likely would not be made, but she would check. In her absence and all things about the night considered, we decided that if these folks who can put together a grilled flat iron steak with caramelized shallots couldn't manage to slap together two pieces of bread and some cheese we didn't want any of it.   Our server came back a few minutes later and happily informed us that a grilled cheese was not available. As agreed, we asked for the check. \"I am so glad I didn't put that order in,\" she declared with glee. An appropriate tip ensued and we were on our way out. Before leaving, though, we stopped to ask about the availability of the grilled cheese in the marketplace. It was not available, a manger-type-looking person said, because the materials had been put away for the day. I'm wondering, of course, why at the end of the afternoon the folks at Olive & Ivy need to file away bread and cheese in some far-flung locker that is apparently on a sort of time lock until the next day's lunch. I also was curious as to why a restaurant --- fancy or otherwise --- would throw away what would have been an extra $100 in sales because of a grilled cheese. Say what you will about our tactics. But in the end, all of our problems came to an end when we walked out the half-broken front door."}
{"text":"Great patio along the canal. Cool, romantic vibe. The food is just OK, but the $5 mimosas on Saturday and Sunday make up for the ho-hum menu."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Olive & Ivy and I would definitely go back!  Great place to sit and relax in the middle of a nice day and have lunch with a friend.  My food was great, but I have to say the service was Excellent. Our server was Kim - she provided some of the best service I've had in awhile! If you go in, hope you get her!"}
{"text":"Olive and B.S.   Once again the hype outlives the product. I had lunch there again today and left disappointed again. I eat lunch out 5 days a week always at nice places mostly on business. This place does not stand up against others in the neighborhood and price range. Parking is always a hassle the valet is a mess and takes too long because the garage is a way off by Urban Outfitters. The cafeteria'-like ambiance and small tables are awkward for business and because the place is always packed service is slow but always friendly with the exception of the vapid 16 year old hostesses. After putting my folder on the floor, no space on the table, I ordered. Veal and spinach ravioli, four very small excellent ravioli for $15, one of which was gristle and which I had to spit out. The portion was a ridiculous excuse for an entree portion. I'm done with this place and don't see going back. It's just not worth the price or hassle, especially given the 100 other choices within a three block radius."}
{"text":"Excellent food...very fresh!   I had the Kale Salad, just 1/2 though as it was HUGE, and it was so delicious. I fear I might have licked the bowl had no one been looking! I also ordered the gnocchi, which was really good, not amazing, but still very fresh. I think I might have been too full to truly enjoy it. The wine selection is not as expansive as I would expect based on the decor, but it was sufficient.   One note...for some reason I thought this place was going to be a bit smaller and quiet...not sure what gave me that impression other than the name, but it was large (i.e. the marketplace) and pretty loud and happening. Had a good vibe!"}
{"text":"This place has it all - the menu, atmosphere and service with a smile ! A must for travelers looking for a unique and local dining experience very pleased !"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot.  I have eaten here a handful of times and I enjoyed all of my meal thus far.    You have to go for lunch don't go to dinner because the seen is kind of the same and the lunch menus food tastes a lot better during lunch.  I have not been there in a while but when I went I got grilled lemon chicken with hummus and it was so tasty.  The market place is pretty good, I have only walked through it but saw they had some really good looking stuff to bring home or eat on the go.  Recommendation: to the people at the mall who want to have a nice lunch and enjoy a cocktail, but not for dinner."}
{"text":"Dining outside in the patio in July end in Phoenix may seem unthinkeable but it works at this place. Very good location and quite busy on a Friday night makes hanging out here quite fun. And the misters work!  For food we had the pesto flatbread and meatballs as appetisers and they were very good. Everyone also liked their main course- the sea bass, the risotto, the lasagna and the salmon.  However, all good going on's have a but.... in this case it is the dessert. We tried the souffle, the honey cake and cheesecake and in all cases I can say I have had better.  But overall it was a good experience,"}
{"text":"If my mouth could marry a meal, it would wed the meal I recently had at Olive and Ivy.  It was love at first bite.  The fireworks in my mouth were poppin like my lip gloss.  But seriously.  My friend and I were torn between two meals - the scallops and the shrimp risotto.  So we did what any logical foodie would do and split the meals!  I almost cried when I tasted the scallops.  The combination of creamed corn, perfectly prepared scallops, and asparagus was a harmonious combination of deliciousness.  The shrimp risotto was just ok compared to the scallops.  I am sure that if I didn't get the scallops to compare against, I would have loved the risotto.    The drinks here are outstanding as well.  Normally when people refer to themselves or their significant other as a \"mixologist\" I chuckle because come on..he is a bartender, just say it.  HOWEVER, the people mixing up these cocktails get my approval to continue calling themselves \"mixologists\".  I had the daiquiri and my friend had some sour cherry thing.  The cherry comes from Italy and is the only real maraschino cherry out there.  None of that bleached, died, and injected with sugar kind of cherry.   The meal was a bit expensive, but you will not regret it!  I would recommend sitting outside along the canal - yes the smell of fish is overpowering (especially in the summer heat)...but nothing can beat the meal you are about to experience."}
{"text":"Today was a swing and miss. We were told 20 minute wait for patio. After 45 minutes of waiting we complained. We were met with apathy by the slothful gang of careless hostesses. Sorry would have been a good word, but that wasn't in their vocabulary. We left. It left a very bad taste."}
{"text":"Grew up in the area love this restaurant really cool vibe the food is great.. One of my favorite patios!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at the Olive & Ivy restaurant in Scottsdale. The food was good but I did not appreciate be seated as close to another as we were.  We could not have a private conversation and we were close enough to share their food. Never again. Not at those prices."}
{"text":"One of, if not the best, restaurant experiences we've ever had. My husband and I came to Scottsdale for our babymoon, we're expecting our first child. We walked into Olive & Ivy, no reservations, and were told that the wait inside was 2 hours but they could sit us in the patio. We took their offer and glad we did. Our server, Miranda, was attentive from the moment we sat down. She got our drinks right away. I asked if their feta was pasteurized & explained how there are certain cheeses I can't have since I'm pregnant. So we ordered the hummus for an app but no feta to be safe since she wasn't sure. Miranda still followed up with the kitchen to ask about their cheeses being pasteurized or not (which most are), and then we ordered the \"Natural Chicken\" and their ravioli. Radom servers would walk by to refill our waters when needed, food came out quick. My husband went and ordered a mojito, my favorite drink and I joked about how he's torturing me, but she offered a virgin mojito and took her up on it! My husband said it was the best mojito he's ever had and the virgin drink tasted almost identical.  Toward the end of our meal, Miranda brought dessert menus and said, \"Dessert is on me, pick what you'd like!\" We were floored. We ordered the caramelized cake (AMAZING). At first we didn't understand why, and when the dessert came out, it said \"Congratulations!\" with a pink and blue candle. We so impressed with the food and service we asked for the manager, Jimmy. He was hospitable, respected by his employees by the way they interacted with him, and even had me try two of his favorite gelatos.  Suffice to say our dinner experience was incredible. Both my husband and I were servers for a number of years, so for us to have great service from the hosts, bussers, and other servers, was pretty great."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I wish that I could give 1/2 stars. I would rate 3 1/2 vs 3. Really better than ok but I'm not sure that it rates 4 stars. It was a good restaurant but had some pretty big negatives.   The first thing that I notice was how large the restaurant was. It seemed to go on forever. Which was amazing considering how quickly our food came out. They have an open kitchen so you can see how many people they have working in the kitchen. Needless to say it's busy.   One drawback as others have mentioned is the noise level. Fortunately my husband and I were sitting by drapery panels so the 2 of us could carry on a conversation. Others sitting more towards the inside of the restaurant would have a difficult time hearing each other. Another issue is that it is pretty dark. I understand ambiance but this was a little too much. They know this so they do compensate and make the print larger on the menu. When it came to eating and my food was the same color (fish and cauliflower) it was hard to tell exactly what I was putting on the fork.  Our server was very good. Attentive and full of information when clarification was needed for the menu. We had Avocado bruschetta which was just okay. I should of skipped it. I ordered the Pacific Sea Bass. The fish was good and so was the cauliflower. They only thing I didn't care for was the preserved grapefruit. The funny thing is that while eating it I said to my husband that I didn't like the orange flavor that I was sometimes getting on the fish. It was either orange or when they preserve it then it totally changes the taste profile from grapefruit to orange. My husband had the lasagna bolognese. He was happy with his choice.  Overall, a good restaurant. I took off since it was extremely dark and loud. Also, the food comes out almost too quick if you just want to sit and talk. The food was good, especially for the price, not excellent."}
{"text":"Ryan G. is my dude. The restaurant is breathtakingly beautiful- from the hanging lights to the nice patio with music and fire pits. Thankfully Ryan is an intelligent guy and helped guide us through our meal as we were a little overwhelmed by all the choices. We ordered the Irish Blood & Honey and the Belvedere Blue to drink. Fritto Misto and bruschetta to start, followed by scallops and sea bass entrees. We were blown away by everything we ate, especially the seafood dishes. The depth of flavor was awesome. Ryan stopped to chat about our meals and told us how much he loves working in a from-scratch restaurant. We finished with the tres leches cake and left stuffed and amazed. 5 stars for decor, food, and amazing service. We are so excited to come back, and we'll request Ryan when we do."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch. The menu had good options, but I wish there were more. My favorite item was the cinnamon bun."}
{"text":"Another excellent fox restaurant. I have been here twice and both meals have been great. The salads and flatbreads are delicious, fresh, and filling. There are tons of vegetarian options. The servers are friendly and knowledgeable.(Christian was AWESOME) and the patio is beautiful, not many restaurants in AZ really create a special atmosphere, so bonus points for that."}
{"text":"My friends and I came in for a bachelorette party dinner. Unfortunately, our weekend had gotten off to a bad start so we had to find a last minute place for dinner. Luckily, we found Olive & Ivy. We made a reservation for 7:15 that night. We were seated immediately at a cute table by the window that overlooked the canal. First, the atmosphere here is amazing! It was cozy yet had a young and fun atmosphere.  We had one vegan and one vegan/vegetarian in our party of 4. Our waiter Easton was phenomenal. He recommended the perfect (strong, well-made) cocktails that really started off our night on the right note. As we were ordering our meals, Easton suggested adding medium-cooked salmon to one of the salads and it was a fantastic choice.   The best part of the service was that Easton noticed two in our party were ordering vegan. So without even having to ask, he brought out our appetizers with all the dairy on the side so the vegans didn't have to pick it off (we ordered the artichoke and hummus apps). It was so thoughtful! Definitely a great restaurant choice for those looking for vegan or veg options. Our party had a flatbread, 3 salads, bruschetta and the appetizers. Everything was fantastic. We were all trying each other's food at the end!   We could not have asked for better service or food and for the location, the prices were great too. The bride was thrilled with our last minute change of plans. We will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Really good food healthy ,great taste and light and organic. Outside seating is best by. the canal -it is m quiet unlike indoors which is rather noisey. Service is impeccable. reservations recommended as there are often lines. Have eaten there many times and very reliable quality."}
{"text":"Another FOX restaurant just like True Food Kitchen.  We tried this out for both a brunch and a dinner.  Both did not disappoint...  Everything was fresh and clean tasting, and the services was very good for breakfast.  The service for dinner was much slower and not as responsive, but we can chalk that up to a busy night, and maybe their expectation that people will just be setting around socializing.  Be sure to order coffee.  It has to be some of the best coffee I have had..."}
{"text":"The best Brunch, Lunch & Dinner. .. With a very cool vib and Love the patio...   Fresh Healthy Food with a conscious. Made daily...  This place has a spot in my heart..... Never ever disappointed.... Always excellent !! Thank. You ..."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service.  The fillet of beer, flatbreads and peanut butter dessert are all very, very good."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write this review for over two months....amazing food as always and the best server I have had in a long time - Tommy! Normally we go for dinner (sweet potato cannelloni is my fave) but stopped in for lunch this time. Tommy was attentive, made excellent suggestions (pastrami Reuben) and built up an excellent rapport immediately with us. He maintained this great attitude and  service throughout the entire meal! Normally we leave raving about the food, this time we left commenting on the amazing service!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place! The beautiful courtyard and fun food options, while sitting on a couch enjoying a cocktail is perfect. For 9 months a year, sitting outside next to river walk, is my peace. However, the market inside is my go to place for a delicious grab and go lunch. My girlfriends and I love to have happy hour inside too!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Great menu, salads were delicious. As we were leaving in the market area the manager was there and we were chatting telling him it was our first time at the restaurant and he gave us 2 desserts on the house! So nice and unnecessary!"}
{"text":"Ate here tonight celebrating a family members birthday. Had heard about this place from multiple friends so we decided to give it a try. When you first walk in you are impressed with the ambiance and the overall atmosphere, very cool. Love the open kitchen and waterfront patio. Our server, sorry could not remember her name, was very good, very attentive and was on top of things all night. For appetizers we ordered a plate of bruschetta and the Fritto Misto (calamari, shrimp, and zucchini). The bruschetta was very good but I am unsure as to why the Fritto Misto is even on the menu. I could literally go to any dive bar and get the same dish. Thats my bad for not knowing what Fritto Misto meant, had to look it up, but I like calamari and shrimp so I ordered it. So on to entrees, two people ordered the sea bass, one salmon, one spicy shrimp risotto and I ordered the sea scallops. Everybody loved their entrees including myself. Scallops weren't grainy at all and matched with the polenta it was a very solid dish. We all ordered desert and everybody loved their gelato and lemon cake. Overall Olive and Ivy is very good and I will be going back, just won't be ordering the dive bar appetizer."}
{"text":"Took my sister and brother-in-law here brunch. I have to say it was so delicious. The staff was helpful as we have never been here and we took their recommendations and I will definitely come back again.   It was clean and priced well. As a single mother of twins Im always looking for affordable but good places to eat out and this one now tops my list. Thank you"}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times in the past for some family events, but would have never chosen it for my own outing.  I went tonight with a couple girl friends and really enjoyed the new menu.  I had the corn pasta dish which was AMAZING! The portion was just right, not too much, not too little.  The other girls had the flat bread and a chicken salad, and said both dishes were really yummy.  The decor is nice and the service was good. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Loved this place! It was our anniversary and they did not disappoint. The calamari/shrimp appetizer was the best I've had. I had the goat cheese tortelli pasta and my boyfriend had the steak and they were both delicious. The steak was a little on the expensive side but worth it. Patio is a nice atmosphere and the cocktails are unique and delicious. Overall we were both impressed, and my boyfriend is very picky! And the bread and pesto is great too."}
{"text":"I was glad I found this place in the sea of crap that is Phoenix.  Great to excellent food, not atrociously priced. Great sangria. Beautiful room. Good service. Classy good looking clientele.   Terrific cafe for daytime snacks and coffee."}
{"text":"Just moved next to this location and it comes highly recommended. I decided to go over with some friends and check it out. We set out on the patio area which is absolutely beautiful at night and enjoyed some glasses of wine. Location location location with great food selection. Was not overly impressed with the cafe menu so I will continue to have to find my lunch spot."}
{"text":"Came here on a perfect Arizona winter night.  The lights on the patio make you feel like you are a million miles from ordinary.  The bread and pesto was amazing.  We love this place."}
{"text":"Bachelorette party and stopped in for drinks.  Slow service the entire time.  Came recommended and never will return"}
{"text":"This place is great! I like the outdoor seating, which is casual and trendy. For instance, you can sit on comfy outdoor furniture that is grouped around a fire. The noise level and music are pretty loud, however, so this is not  a place for an intimate date or something.  Almost everything we have eaten here has been excellent, including flatbread, bagels with lox, gelato, and breakfast burritos. (My sister had the gyro, though, and didn't like it because the lamb had too much spice on it; the waiter happily exchanged it for something else). The coffee was pretty blase, though."}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy is a great restaurant with reasonable happy hour and great outdoor patio. We've been there a number of times and continue to go back. The service has always been prompt and friendly. Their pasta dishes are superior!"}
{"text":"Lunch was Amazing! Waiter Highly Recommended to try the hummus, and it literally was the best I have ever tasted!"}
{"text":"I went here for a business dinner as it was close to where I had a meeting.  I was a little skeptical but once we met the hostess everything was top notch.  The cocktails were well prepared, the service staff was great.  The food came on time and one of our party sent something back and the manager personally delivered it to us with an apology.  great service and great Ribeye steak."}
{"text":"We had a birthday group here and really enjoyed the evening.  Many raves about entrees- short ribs, scallops, even chicken! A nice red wine.  The pastry chef had made a fantastic chocolate cake- so glad I got to take some home for the next day!  Service- good and friendly.  I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"A tiny oasis in Terminal 4, Gate A for you to separate from the contant stream of passengers rushing to their next flights.  I have been to the downtown Scottsdale location, so I had high expectations.    In terms of ambiance, they try to recreate the same lighting effects by using large edison bulbs which look hip and steampunkish to me.  The food: I tried the panini.  I stuck with something safe and easy to make.  It was decent and the food arrived promptly.  They have a flatscreen in the niche, but the ambient noise was such that it was hard to hear (assuming the volume was even on).    I nice little location, with hard to mess up options."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for lunch and enjoyed the experience.  The weather had been spectacular recently, so we took advantage of their outdoor seating along the canal.  Great venue to people watch and eat some good food.  One occasion, I had the kale salad with grilled chicken, and another, their margherita flat bread.  Both were delicious and good portions.  What I enjoyed the most, however, was the bread and fresh pesto.  Seriously, that could serve as the sole reason to go back.  It's that good.  Great and friendly service.  Laid back atmosphere.  The ambient noise is at a decent level to hear the people you are with.  Perfect spot to have a good food and enjoy good company."}
{"text":"A great night out and a surprise for quality and flavours as we took a recommendation from a server at another restaurant.  Good wine list, well priced - Panther Creek Pinot noir was a hit with the table.  Margarita special hit the spot when we arrived.  Roasted chicken tender and juicy with flavorful sauce, filet mignon was cooked perfectly.   Service prompt, friendly."}
{"text":"Most incredible place for a glass of wine or a date night but make a reservation. Patio is really beautiful with the trees and cafe style lights strung about. My hubby and I have been going here since we started dating 7 years ago."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  After reading all the rave reviews, my girlfriends and I made a dinner reservation two months in advance for my bachelorette party. When we arrived on a Saturday night the hostesses were dismissive and couldn't find our reservation, even though someone had called to confirm it the day before. The hostess wouldn't even acknowledge my friend, so the rest of us headed to the bar for a drink (the bartender and the drinks are the only reason I gave one star). Eventually our reservation was located and we we were seated outside next to the dumpster. It was a very windy night and the smells from the dumpster and the cold were such a turn off - we asked our waitress to be moved, she left and never returned (after dropping off water for half our party). The hostesses continued to be unhelpful and the manager was even worse!  He just scratched his head and couldn't figure out what to do.   Lastly, some other friends not at dinner had ordered champagne for the table, had their credit card charged and as we left none of the waitstaff or manager had any record of this, no apologies...a week later my friend is still disputing the charge.  This is probably the worst dining experience I've ever had...with no actual dining involved!  We left, walked to Cowboy Chao....AMAZING!!  Great service, fun atmosphere and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Amazing ambience, awesome staff, super yummy pesto, and their tortellini with bacon and braised leek is heaven! Save room for dessert and order the leche cake and the pb pudding"}
{"text":"Food taste great. Highly recommended for a date. Nice atmosphere. But try to make a reservation. I feel that tables are setup very close to each other."}
{"text":"A great atmosphere and great service. The avocado bruschetta was amazing. We wanted to love this restaurant because it had such a neat feel to it, but the food was less than stellar for us. The lamb was flavorless in spots but in other spots I was overwhelmed by spice and seasoning. It was odd and a little disappointing. Really fun place but wouldn't recommend the food necessarily."}
{"text":"I can't speak for dinner, but I've been here twice for brunch and the foods is fantastic.  The brunch prices are very reasonable, 8-14ish  The bread that is served with your meal is awesome. Dip in the olive oil. pesto mixture and you could just eat this for a meal. I know I had a few slices before my meal even arrived. The bread was that good!  The chorizo breakfast burrito is big, flavorful and can match any appetite (including mine). There is fresh pico in the side and some tasty fried potatoes. A good hearty meal  Nice atmosphere. A winner for brunch. The two people my wife and I took here from out of town enjoyed themselves and the food."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST place to be in Scottsdale morning, noon and night!   Flat bread pizza is to die for, the Mediterranean salad is delicious and the wine takes the cake!  I love Olive & Ivy!"}
{"text":"Service was spot on with Christopher. Big eye tuna was seared perfectly, and tasted fresh and delicious. It was served on a bed of slightly crunchy (undercooked?) couscous, however.   Hummus had a nice kick to it and enjoyed the warm artichoke hearts on arugula.   The patio is delightful except for one weird element: bathroom air fresheners nailed to tree trunks made the patio smell vaguely like a public bathroom. That made one conscious of the slight fishy smell from the canal and, maybe a little trash smell wafted through?  Not overwhelming but certainly mildly off-putting."}
{"text":"It's typical nouveau-riche Scottsdale scene. Yes it's lovely and big, and yes that's how they do it there...I have to agree with sarah k...push the culinary and cocktail envelope, I know they have the talent... do something with it....the servers are all very young and beautiful, maybe they just need to learn more about customer service. Mine was very attentive, no complaints on that. All in all it's a \"nice\" place, nothin special."}
{"text":"I remember coming here with a friend a while ago for brunch. Contrary to some other comments, I'ld argue that their ambience stays true to Scottsdale's modern, upscale environment. It's still Arizona/West Coast influenced without needing cacti and adobe houses. I remember being really pleased with the food, but for some reason the bread really stood out to me. Their salad is, of course, a reliable option, but their good food attracts a lot of people and you're lucky to catch a seat without setting a reservation first. The servers are a bit too friendly, they might stay hanging around and make conversation with you if not every table is occupied. I'ld want to go back soon."}
{"text":"Great service! The food is consistently delicious. Let's not forget that focaccia and pesto complementary starter, it's amazing. Drinks always hit the spot. Atmosphere is great for a nice dinner or a lunch on the patio."}
{"text":"Yeah - I'd bring friends from out of town to check it out.  It's a fun lively spot for happy hour and post sun down week-ends.   The food is good but not consistant. Tapas are your best bet; entrees / specials just don't fulfill the expectation or promise.  It's good the first couple of times then becomes an after thought. The little market is cool and nice for a quick snack or take-out for a park picnic or your hotel room. Good drinks but tell them to half the ice."}
{"text":"Great food! The ambiance in the patio is perfect. So relaxing and welcoming. Today i was joined by my better half and two daughters. We ordered the Gyro, Piccante flatbread, Burger and Chicken Panini. All very good. The Gyro is not their specialty I would pass on that. Burger was real good. Flatbread awesome... Service is really good.. Not 5 cause well abit overpriced, but its Scottsdale!!!"}
{"text":"Cocktails and small plates on the patio. You must ask for Timmy. Witty, knowledgable and fun! White cranberry cosmos and ivy and ginger first round."}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy is yet another Fox Concept Restaurant gone right. They have a couple different eating areas that have their own vibe. The wine room is more casual, the bar area has a trendy feel, and the dining area is date night appropriate. The ambience can suit your mood. The food is absolutely delicious and tastes as fresh as can be. The wine is tasty. Overall for the quality the price is right. It is a great dining experience every time I go!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was great It was a perfect day to enjoy the good food, a sangria and good companionship in the lovely outdoor setting.  There bread and pesto sauce served prior to the meal is to die for,  Over time I have had many of their menu items, all of them pleasing to me.  this visit I had oatmeal, one companion had a very delicious salad. (I tried it) The meal and the surroundings make this Sunday  a special day.  I must mention that there was a slight snag with our reservation but the manager Genevieve Wallick quickly resolved the problem.  The high quality of the management in this restaurant Is defiantly a plus and adds to the overall experience."}
{"text":"Been here twice and the food is pretty consistent. Service is a little up and down, depending on how \"busy\" it is ... seems to be the less busy, the less attention you get. Otherwise, the menu is varied and there is a good selection of drinks. Apps and salads are strong -- portions are a reasonable size -- and you can even get half salads. Desserts are good!"}
{"text":"Yummy food! Beautiful atmosphere. Don't miss the pesto and bread and my two favorites which are big enough to split the Mediterranean salad with chicken and the sweet potato cannelloni! Literally olive and ivy is the best. Oh and while the weather is beautiful sit on the patio"}
{"text":"Applebee'sesque, below average to average with poorly trained ASU wait staff."}
{"text":"They have amazing bruschetta!!!! Absolutely love this place, great date night or girls night out! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my boyfriend for our anniversary. The inside is really beautiful and the outdoor patio is incredible. I will definitely be back when the weather cools down to enjoy some food out there. There had a dj that Saturday evening which I really liked, he kept the vibe inside the restaurant light and fun. The food was delicious and they gave us a complimentary dessert for a special occasion. They even let us pick from the dessert menu ourselves instead of giving us a chocolate something like most restaurants do. You don't have to spend a lot of money here but also you can very easily spend a lot of money here. I would definitely come back on a regular evening, not just a special occasion."}
{"text":"I've eaten 33,567 meals in my life (11,189 days since I was born - 3 meals a day). The sweet potato cannelloni from this restaurant is the best dish I've ever eaten. Nothing more to say."}
{"text":"This is a much needed update review for Olive & Ivy, the initial 3.5-star rating has been long passed to a very solid 4-star!   I can't count how many times I have been back here, for many different occasions, Olive & Ivy has always been one of the top choices for its food, ambiance, service and location. I always enjoyed the beginning course of bread and pesto dip/sauce, the latest addition of the ribeye seems to be one of our favorites by the group of friends.   Look forward to my next visit :)"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in town, hands down. Love the \"sceney\" vibe, and the food is great to go with it."}
{"text":"It was nice but not a great experience.  The music was very loud.    The waitress was very helpful and knew the menu and the wines and made some good recommendations (love the Newton Chard).  We split a salad and a pizza.  The watermelon salad was an incredible medley of complex flavors - the red chili giving the watermelon, avocado and goat cheese some kick to offset the sweetness.  Very interesting.  We got the funghi trifolati pizza and it was just ok.  After the first wonderful taste of mushrooms, it was all very bland with nothing to make it stand out.  I think next time I would try sitting on the patio as that looked very inviting and relaxing."}
{"text":"I like this place, even though it's a chain.  We went there in the cold of winter (50 degrees) ...and sat outside.  They have great fire pits and lots of heat lamps, but you kind of had to be right under them to not be too cold.  The drinks are really good, but if you specify your alcohol, the prices increases quite a bit...I mean, come on, $26.00 for two grey goose drinks????  It's in a good location, with good outdoor seating, and great cocktails.  I remember going there six months ago and enjoying the food, but it's just an okay place."}
{"text":"Bachelorette brunch for 7 girls = success! (even with one girl sick from the night before :P)  Great brunch menu, affordable prices, great service w/ hot waiter ;), great location in the mall & close to the W hotel where we stayed, awesome outdoor seating area w/ misters.. basically sums up this place.  Came here for brunch on a Saturday, we had reservations and were seated right away.  It's a fairly big restaurant (reminded me of cheesecake factory), good for big groups, but saw lots of couples as well.. it looks like they have some private rooms towards the back which look pretty cool.  We would've gone for the mimosas, but were hungover from the night before.  Otherwise, this place serves solid brunch food.  Really good bread, HUGE portions.  I recommend the eggs benedict.  Bride got the S'MORES CHOCOLATE LATTE - WOWSERS!  that's one huge special cup of coffee.  My only complaint is that the food came out a bit cold.  Would return!"}
{"text":"Great vibe, good food.  Be brave choosing your entreé, everything is awesome.  Desserts are amazing as well, compliments to the chef!"}
{"text":"I had great expectations for brunch.   I ordered the eggs Benedict with hash potatoes.  For $13 I thought it would be great.   It was served to me ice cold, eggs were raw on top and hard boiled inside.  I had to wait & wait for waiter to return since the food runner drop off the food.  The waiter did not seem to know how to fix the problem.  He asked \"Did you want another one?\"  I replied \"It would be nice to have it warm and  cooked properly.\"  In the meantime my friends continued to eat their Bruch without me.  Finally I got my dish, low and behold the potatoes were almost gone on the plate and again my egg was raw on top and slightly, and I mean slightly warm.   I do not recommend having Bruch at this establishment."}
{"text":"Good food, awesome design (in and outside) and cool environment. The three of us sat outside mid morning with a very welcome 65 degree breeze. Turns out I sat facing away from many a typical scottsdaleian, so wasn't too reminded of where I was and what crowd was there. All that matters anyway is the company you're with:) A little pricier than I'd like, but not nutso expensive (~$10 for coffee, egg sandwich + fruit) . Who knows if my review of this place is biased because of the great conversation that accompanied the meal I had, but either way, I left with a smile and a happy and contented tummy:)"}
{"text":"Excellent!  First, we were seated on the patio in 107 degree temps. Misters and shade made it completely pleasant!  Then...,Bruschetta, Greek salad, shrimp risotto, sea bass ... and this ridiculous lemon cake - everything was delicious!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a group of girlfriends on a Friday a couple weekends ago.  We sat on the patio and had a sweet waitress.  The sangria was amazing, food was fantastic, and overall our experience was great!"}
{"text":"I went with my family on a Friday evening. The sea bass was delicious, and our server Kara was very knowledgable and friendly."}
{"text":"I always leave here happy and full! The cocktails are very tasty and at a good price point. If you come at lunch the crowd is usually business men but nighttime is a different story. There are always trendy good looking people to look at while enjoying some appetizer pita and hummus and a delicious pasta dish. If you are still hungry try one of their 16 different gelato flavors."}
{"text":"Customer Service is HORRIBLE!! I was meeting my husband and son at 4:00 for a late lunch, and from the time I walked in the front desk girls took their sweet time seating us. They talked about all the tables in the restaurant while I waited and waited in front of them  It was so rude and obnoxious to have customers waiting. She then told me that she can seat me, but we would have to be done in 2 hours because they have a big party coming in.  I told her we would be done, but would like to sit outside.  She told me that she can't put me outside due to the fact that it might rain at 7:00.  I told her that's 3 hours from now!!!! Then her manager Jimmy came by and by then I was upset and told them that it's rude to have the customer sitting there waiting. I asked to be seated. I told them I had been there for so long that I even knew how many seats were open.  Instead of apologizing Jimmy said, \"Good for you!\"   I finally sat down and my family came in.  When I told my husband what happened he immediately got up and wanted to leave.  On our way out Jimmy, the manager stopped me to \"apologize\" and I told him to not treat people like a jerk next time so he'll have nothing to apologize for!!   I have supported Olive and Ivy for YEARS!!!  I come here all the time and have celebrated many important events here.  There are MANY restaurant choices in PV/Scottsdale area. I wont be supporting this one any longer, and I'm happy to spread the word on how horribly I was treated."}
{"text":"What a cool place. You can either sit and be served in the dining area, or order sandwiches and salads to go, or eat those outside on the front patio. Did a lunch group here for a buddy's birthday, and we enjoyed ourselves.  I ordered the mediterranean salad w/ chicken, and it was great! Delicious, very healthy (not the typical overloaded salad you buy at chain restaurants), good size, and I wasn't under the spell of a carb coma the rest of the afternoon!"}
{"text":"Great prices, and fast food.  Downsides... Limited drink selection, and no butter or jam for bread.  Other than that, this place is good to go."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have a gluten free menu which is great for those allergic, super convenient. I eat here all the time!"}
{"text":"Aaron was our server for brunch and exceeded all of our expectations! He made sure everything was up to our standards and the food was great as usual. See ya guys next Sunday!"}
{"text":"This place always delivers.  Solid food, solid service, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Cool for sure, great design and staff. The dishes are great however the quality of product is meh. I like being there, i just feel ripped eating there:/"}
{"text":"A few years ago my friend had her birthday dinner here. We were seated in the back room w/ the long table. It was a fun night. One of the Phoenix Suns coach was there that night and took care of us.  Anyway I've been here several times since then, and always have a great time. I love the open high ceilings w/ dark wood flooring and swanky decor. Of all the times we would come here, it had always been on a busy wkend night... So the ambiance is perfect... packed w/ good-looking people mingling at the inviting open bar.  My most recent visit was yesterday...which was my first experience having lunch here. There was a live band and the floor-to-ceiling windows were wide open to the patio... wow it looked great. We decided to not wait for the table since we found seats at the bar. I have to rave about the salad.... Mediterranean w/ chicken.... OMG one of the best I've ever tasted... absolutely delicious! And the crisp White Haven was paired perfectly w/ it ( and I'm not a big fan of white wine... but it was a warm sunny day). The service was a bit slow but the bartender admitted they were short- staffed... And it was super busy. So I didn't mind as long as our wine glasses were topped off... :) which he promptly always did w/ a smile."}
{"text":"Smoke and mirrors...atmosphere vs substance....  I am NOT a fan. This is your typical Scottsdale spot that puts their efforts into the decor (which is REALLY nice) and not into their boring menu.  Skip it."}
{"text":"Whenever I have the opportunity to go \"out\" with my husband, we go here.  Its worth the drive from Gilbert and the food is amazing.  The portions are just the right size and are delicious.  There is also some great people watching!  Its also a great place to bring out of town guests."}
{"text":"I would give a 5 star because the service deserves 5 stars our server was Michael and made our experience amazing! We were there celebrating our friends birthday and he was so attentive, fun, and just enough attention but not being annoying! He had great suggestions and was very knowledgeable about the menu! The food was also great!   The reason I gave a 3 star was because I called to make A reservation for the private room and apparently you have to call a separate  number and they are only there Mon - fri 8-4 or something so if you have weekend plans don't waste your time calling because they won't even bother to call you back.  I did call Friday at like 10 am but still I can't even get a call back by four?! This is the second time I have tried to reserve this room and have not received a call. To top it off during the time of the reservation that room was empty!! This probably isn't the restaurants fault so I feel bad giving the 3 stars but I think its kinda crappy I can't  get a call back when this is their job!   I highly recommend this restaurant and Michael but if you have a private party your better off just making reservations in the dining room."}
{"text":"We gave this place 2 chances and both times were unimpressed by the food, atmosphere and the service.  Yes, the location is awesome but the food has more than disappointed both times. It's difficult to get the attention of your waitperson, like they couldn't be bothered, and the atmosphere just feels cold, very anonymous, no warmth from anyone.  Last time, the chefs needed 3 times to make the eggs even acceptable. This time, no one greeted us, bartender was uninterested; the only ones to say hello were the hostesses on the way out. So, yes, great location but as the review says...Meh. I've definitely experienced better."}
{"text":"On the evening of Mar 17 our group of 4 ate at the Olive and Grape.  Booked the reservation by phone several days ahead, on arrival the table was ready.  Staff arrived promptly.  Drink orders were taken and served promptly.  The atmosphere was quite noisey, at times it was hard to hear conversation at the table.  Decor was very appropiate.  Menu had great selection.  All  4 had a first course, 3 different salads and one soup.  All were outstanding.  The main courses were spinach and veal ravioli, monk fish and sweet potatoe cannelloni.  Again outstanding in presentation and taste.  Dessert was cheesecake, gelato and a torte.  Service was excellent.  Price was appropiate to the restaurant.  Parking is a real plus, free indoor parking in the building.  Valet parking is also available.  We have been here on a prior trip and would go back in the future."}
{"text":"I went to Olive & Ivy for the first time for my friends bridal shower which was held in the banquet room.  We were promptly greeted and were offered mimosas or white sangria.  I had the sangria which was awesome, not too sweet.  The server was extremely attentive and very nice (I wish I knew her name).  Anyhow, the entire menu was great.  I especially enjoyed the pizza which had lox on it.  I never had lox on pizza, but it might just be my favorite thing.  You could tell the ingredients were super fresh.  I will definitely be back and only gave 4 stars because I need to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Old Town is Olive & Ivy. You can come here and sit on the patio for some appetizers and cocktails or dine in for the most amazing Wild Mushroom Papparedelli (spelling?). The caesar salad is wonderful as well and cocktails are fabulous. Try the blood orange one!"}
{"text":"So delicious.  Went here for mother's day with my mom.  I ordered a pizza, absolutely delicious.  And the bread they bring out is one of the best I have ever tasted!  I seriously recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy has become our favorite weekend dinner spot! The people and food are both amazing! We love the happy smiles and great service that we get every time.  I advise calling in a week ahead (or more) of when you are planning on coming because they fill up fast. If you aren't able to get a table we always love to sit at the bar or on the smalls bar couches around it. I strongly suggest ordering the bruschetta and the lamb meatballs! For dessert my favorite is their cheesecake. There is a new flavor everytime. But honestly everything I've had there has been amazing and Olive and Ivy is definitely one of my favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"This place is characterized by rude service, okay food, and a generally callous attitude toward customers . Ideally, this place would suit those who are looking for an awful evening in a nice part of town!  If you are anything other than lily white, blondes preferred,   expect to wait an eternity for any service.  The waitress we were unlucky to get was indeed a RACIST.  She was downright belligerent and rude, behaving as if she was doing us a favor by even getting us food and drinks. We were a group of eight people and had a tab in the $400-500 range yet got lousy service.  The manager was not helpful either and his attitude was simply that the waitress is usually very good - this despite the fact that we complained that she was awful. I have been here twice and will NEVER GO HERE again."}
{"text":"Just OK.  There are so many restaurants to choose from in South Scottsdale that you really need to stand out.  Olive & Ivy didn't do it for me.  Don't get me wrong, nothing was terrible, it was just OK.  At this price point, in this location, OK may not be good enough."}
{"text":"Friends of ours from the area took us here after a Cubs game and we had a very enjoyable experience. The ambience is very cool/trendy and the patio looked awesome. Super comfortable, with good seats/couches, heaters (which for Arizonians is a must), and acoustic musicians...I hear at night the bar can be somewhat of a pain because of overcrowdedness.  Food was solid. For app: Prosciutto with an abnormally large portion of meat. Fried Calamari which had a good reception for those who ate it and an awesome salad.  For dinner: I ordered the short rib which was fantastic...however when I first looked at it...wasn't so sure. Not a big portion upon first glance but after devouring an extremely tender piece of meat (even sharing a few bites) I felt differently. The pureed corn was a nice touch and I was extremely satisfied once finished. The dessert looked just as good and was from what the rest of the table said.  Only downside: Waitress seemed preoccupied the entire meal and not really all that friendly. No recommendations, monotone, and looking over your shoulder as she explained the specials and taking your order...maybe she wasn't a Cubs fan....who knows."}
{"text":"lunch today with a friend have not been here for quiet some time. they changed up  the menu a bit but some of my favorites are still there and are still just a good. (dates wrapped in bacon) shared a med salad and sweet potatoe cannonolli was wonderful. we sat at the bar and peter took great care of us very pleasennt and knowledgable of the menu and made some great suggestions. fox resturant knows how to do somethings right and this place is still a hit with me...thx"}
{"text":"Service was good, food was average and location was great. Felt a little rushed as they were trying to turn tables. Pesto flatbed had great flavor but but my chicken dish fell flat."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place got such mixed reviews. Restaurant decor was really nice. Out waitress was attentive but not over bearing. They had a good wine list. I ordered the sea bass which was pretty good. The best thing however was the free bread and pesto they served. The pesto was so yummy. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Minnesota and found this adorable place for lunch. This restaurant is amazing  it's absolutely beautiful and I have never had better food or better service. Melinda was the sweetest server ever. She was never overbearing but was always there when we needed her. We were celebrating a bride-to-be and they gave her a complimentary desert and wrote Congratulations on the plate! I would absolutely come back if I was ever in Scottsdale again!"}
{"text":"The location is good, and the patio can be wonderful on a winter afternoon.  The food, however, seems to be about 20% overpriced for what you receive.  It isn't bad, mind you, but it certainly isn't worth the prices they charge.  The bar area gets very, very crowded on Friday nights, which can be good or bad, depending on what you're in the mood for.  It is a nice place for drinks, and maybe appetizers.  Skip it for dinner, though, and try someplace else within walking distance in old town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"After a long search found a restaurant in scottsdale which not only looks good, has great ambience but also serves outstanding food. The watermelon salad was very fresh and the bruschetta was double thumbs up!! Not very pricey even though it looks upscale. Absolutely fallen in love with this place and I just can't wait for the next weekend to try rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Bacon wrapped dates.  I don't think I need to say more, but I will anyway!  I had the dates and an arugula salad, both were very fresh and delicious.  The bread that's brought to the table is good too - don't skip the pesto that comes with it.  This is not your average \"throw-some-olive-oil-and-cracked-pepper-together-and-call-it-a-dipping-sauce\" kind of stuff.  I could almost make a meal out of the bread and pesto alone.  Our waitress was almost over the top attentive, but I'll take that over one that disappears any day."}
{"text":"I am in town for work with a few coworkers. We wanted a restaurant that was more unique to Scottsdale. Olive & Ivy was wonderful. Great atmosphere without being stuffy, the waitress knew the menu and answered all of our questions, and the red sangrias were delicious. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised at how good the food was here after coming for a late dinner.  We started out with the beet salad and lamb meatballs.  The beet salad was full of beets, which I find to be so rare at most restaurants.  The lamb meatballs were really juicy, but I wish they gave more tzatziki with them.  For entrees, I got the margherita flatbread and my husband got the chicken.  Both were really delicious and flavorful.  Our favorite was the foccacia and pesto that we got with our meal, and it was soooooo good!  I want that pesto recipe!  We also got a few cocktails to go with our meal, which were well-priced for the size of the glass.  Next time, we'll save room for dessert because the gelatos looked great!  Loved the ambiance and bar seating in front of the open kitchen too."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! Very chill spot. Great food. Service was so nice and efficient."}
{"text":"Wine Enthusiasts Beware! A party of 6 (2 winery owners, 1 collector,  and 4 wine industry professionals STRUGGLED to find a white wine by the glass that wasn't over-oaked or sweet.    Our server was patient and accommodating but we have to question the wine buyers palate.   If you are listening.. PLEASE offer a better variety of white wine BTG selections. Not everyone enjoys oaky buttery high alcohol wines with RS."}
{"text":"This restaurant was surprisingly really good. I've found that a lot of the restaurants in Scottsdale are either pretty or have high quality food, but Olive and Ivy offer both. I recommend coming here for a birthday or special event. (They also offer vegetarian options!)"}
{"text":"I give O & I 4 stars because it is such a SCOTTSDALE SCENE that I want to really turn my nose up at it...but, really, it is intended to be that sort of place, and it is fabulous at what it does...so ignore the criticism, lol!  Really, at the end of the day, there is a reason this place is a classic here.  It may be enormous, but it is truly gorgeous, the food is phenomenal and interesting, and for a crowd place, nothing provides the same kind of elegant fun.  If you are over 40 and want to soak up the Scottsdale Nightlife vibe without feeling out of place, this spot is Paradise indeed!"}
{"text":"Tried this with friend on a Thursday night - made a reservation and got a lovely table that was inside/outside.  The outside tables look a little difficult to eat at, so we were glad we were  \"on the edge\" !  The bread and pesto is DELICIOUS - perhaps a bad discovery as I could come back to this place just for that !  The red sangria is also fabulous.  We split a salad and a flatbread and a cheese plate - all were awesome - we wanted to try everything. Then 2 folks had scallops and for the non-seafood folks they had the veal ravioli - all were excellent - what we loved was they they split the plates already between us so there was no reaching over or fighting over the last piece  We will be back !"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and always enjoy myself.  Being from Seattle...I love the opportunity to eat outside.  The outdoor seating is really nice and staff is friendly.  Come here for drinks, dinner or the gelato!"}
{"text":"We went here for Mother's Day.  We ordered the wild mushroom, shrimp and corn soup, which was so good even my seven year old ate it.  I also had the Crab Eggs Benedict which was so-so.  The best eggs benedict are still at Crackers and Co. in Mesa.  There was no kids menu, so we just had them make fettucini with butter for the kids.  My four year old really enjoyed the focaccia with pesto.  Overall, I'd say the food was decent, but I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy was the suggestion of a friend. I wasn't to keen on the idea of driving up to Scottsdale in the middle of the week to eat expensive and tasteless food. Now, I come from California so my idea of a \"waterfront\" is very different than that of someone who lives in the desert. I'll give Scottsdale some credit though; the \"waterfront\" looks better when you're sitting beside it, at night, eating pesto and bread with sangria at Olive and Ivy.  We waited about 30 minutes for a table for three on a Wednesday night. We sat outside on their very nice patio right on the \"waterfront\". They bring you pesto and bread to start, and its so delicious and plentiful, we probably didn't need to order an appetizer. The appetizer we did get was the calamari which was delish. A friend and I split a pitcher of sangria...a little pricey but good. For my main, I ordered the mediterrean flatbread with no cheese and it was very good. The portion was huge so I took almost the entire thing home for lunch the next day. Service was good and the atmosphere is nice, especially the outside.  Overall, very good experience. A little on the pricier side (if you order drinks!) but I think its a great place to start a night out with friends."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the vibe at Olive and Ivy! The indoor is just as great as the amazing outdoor.  The open kitchen and spacious dining room is great.  The food is definitely delicious and innovative.  My compliments to the chef and the creative minds who put together the menu. I recommend this place for a cocktail after work, dinner, or even a nice weekend afternoon, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The best airport breakfast out there. Fast easy and fresh.  The price was excellent too for an airport."}
{"text":"Well lets see.  Come here a bunch of times, mostly decent but over priced for quality of food. Service USUALLY is good. However went there with a party of 4. Paid $100 in cash and then the rest on my card....(50/50 split between two people)  Turns out the waiter took all the cash and charged the whole bill to my card.....took a long time to dispute it with the manager who for whatever reason was very hesitant to reverse the transaction until I threatened to file a fraud report with my bank.....  I read another review of a similar situation....seems like a real problem there"}
{"text":"I tried Margherita Flatbread at lunch today. The strong scent of basil was refreshing. Melted mozzarella embraced my taste buds. Server was very kind and offered timely service. Overall, wonderful experience"}
{"text":"Always a nice experience at O&I, especially on chill winter nites where an outdoor gas fire pit gives that extra romance to ones Friday date nites! It's always packed in the dining room on weekends so we were happy to just curl up on one of their rocking patio chairs and warm up our toes  al fresco style. Service was spot on and we were attended to with waters and warm tasty focaccia bread as we waited for our entrees.   I hate to pry in on other neighboring conversations but when distance to ones nearby diner is an arms length away one can get caught up on a perhaps first date encounter as were we. Cute divorcee doctor with kids and a seemingly nice real estate agent were engaged in fabulous banter over some champ. Ahhh so nostalgic are the days of butterfly flurries during mating season, but I digress.  Dinner was promptly served, our prosciutto flatbread got rave remarks from the hubs, excellent dough texture and not too charred as some places fail. My sea bass kept its temperature outdoors and was perfectly cooked. While hubby's filet had a wonderful red wine reduction over scalloped potatoes.  O&I is the perfect location for an intimate casual yet impressing outing and ask the old adage goes, make love not war! Next month I'm considering booking the private room for my next annual Valentines girls nite out..."}
{"text":"Had a Sunday dinner here and I love Olive & Ivy every single time i go.  Our waitress, Tess, was very nice and attentive. I love the Hummus!!!! Its a little on the spicy side and oh so delicious. Th patio is perfection, so check this place out. The ambiance is amazing and perfect for a date too. Happy Dinning"}
{"text":"Simple review. Good food. Great atmosphere and service. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"We arrive to test drive this eatery for the 1st time only to be warned that two groups had booked the main dining area & a separate private room.  While I scouted the edges for an acceptable spot for the two of us, my wife appraised the patio. Finding the latter uncrowded and heaters available to ward of a light breeze on a cool eve, we settled in with Suzie as our attentive server...We hastened our selection to get them to the kitchen and bar before the herds arrived. Pleasantly affordable, generously proportioned and delightfully flavored. We'll return again this week to try some other offerings & bring our friends along to delight them when we return to the valley next month.  Very nice setting on the canal, convenient to parking and the Old Town core."}
{"text":"Only because I have to give a rating.  Nothing bothers me more than when you bring friends in from out of town and not only do you get the worst service, but unfortunately we got no service.  Save yourself the trip and pick any place else."}
{"text":"Amazing food every time! Love the patio atmosphere. The service is always excellent. Good for special occasions or well needed happy hours."}
{"text":"This wouldn't be 5 stars if it weren't in the airport.  However, for an airport restaurant, never had better service and a fresher salad.  After a day's worth of travel, it was a pleasant experience to be helped and served by the staff and Olive & Ivy.  For instance, sitting at my table but I didn't have a drink and a young lady came by and asked if I wanted water...  with a smile!  She genuinely seemed happy to serve the customer!  Server behind the counter was just as helpful when ordering.  More than willing to change my order and make the already-made salad exactly the way I wanted it.  I will go out of my way to eat there again if I'm in the PHX airport.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I had an hour long layover in Phoenix and was looking for an early lunch. There weren't many restaurants with vegetarian options around but I decided to try O+I. I was initially hesitant about getting an airport salad but I was happily surprised with the Mediterranean! The veggies were fresh and the toasted almonds added a great crunch. I'll be recreating this one at home. The paninis also looked tasty but most included some kind of meat. All in all, worth a stop if you are in Terminal 4!"}
{"text":"I went for the birthday party of a friend. We had a table of 10 but we got our own private room so it was very nice.   I ordered the Sangria, and that was not Sangria, i lived in spain, i know what Sangria tastes like, and that was like wine mixed with water....It was super strong as well, so at least if you didn't like it you could get drunk quickly and forget.   We ordered the Calamari for the appetizer and it was so so. It was supposed to come with Aioli sauce, once again, i've lived in spain, i know what aioli is and what its supposed to taste like. I felt like this tasted more like dill dip....   We ordered the Shrimp Risotto which I was thoroughly looking forward to, but it was bland.... It was a cream sauce without any real flavor to it. The side potato dish was better than the risotto, but it was nothing more that scalloped potatoes.   The honest truth is that the best thing i had while i was there was the bread and olive oil pesto dip. Which is ridiculous when you think how much you're paying to eat here.   Another thing i would say is that everything we ordered was recommended by the server. I'm totally not blaming him, because we wanted to order it before we even asked him, but he told us each time that it was a good selection.   Generally, I might try it again, but it wont be anytime soon and I'll be a lot more skeptical."}
{"text":"Best mediterranean salad in all of AZ! The marketplace is my go-to for a quick salad."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for two, they took us straight back right on time. The patio is awesome! Right on the water and lots of trees! We had the bruschetta appetizer and it was great! Great stiff drinks! Our server was great. Definitely a place worth checking out."}
{"text":"Above my expectation for airport food. I always disliked the food that I got in airports and this us the first time I actually liked the food. Staff are also friendly"}
{"text":"I was able to snag the chef's table on a busy night and it was a wonderful experience. The chef influenced my husband to finally try hummus despite my years of trying!   They were very understanding of my dietary allergies and restrictions. They were charming and the food is absolutely amazing!   I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to any and all that want a superb dining experience."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here with a group friends. We shared the Mediterranean salad and the butternut squash flatbread. It was all delicious and filling. I had the shrimp risotto for my entree and tried so hard to finish it but it was just too much food. Service was excellent.  Would definitely recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Bar tender really bad.  Stands in front of you and acts busy.  We ate and had a few drinks and he could not even refill the drinks.  Food is not great and with this service I'd say find someplace else. Who needs bad service at these prices!!!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Had a breakfast club sandwich and it was very good. Actually GREAT for airport food! Hot, fresh, and tasty!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants!! The pesto is amazing! Cool cocktails and entrees.  Sweet potato canneloni is super yummy!! Love the ambiance of this place.  Have always had great service here too."}
{"text":"Fabulous Downtown Scottsdale farm to table restaurant. Delicious food, nicely presented, reasonably priced. Very accommodating chef that customized my meal. Sit outside on the rear patio overlooking the river. Great gelato flavors served with yummy shortbread cookie. Save room!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time this week on a Monday and to my surprise it was busy! The food and drinks took a while to come to our table maybe bc they were busy but the food was very good and the place was very nicely decorated"}
{"text":"Oh me oh my, but such a welcoming refuge from the three-digit heat of Arizona. Located at the Waterfront in Scottsdale, which is in fact a man-made canal that is surrounded by a plethora of restaurants, condos, business establishments and a huge indoor mall. Olive and Ivy serves food to order/take out at their deli section, or food to dine in their patio outside under umbrellas and h20 forced mist (misters?). Since it was 120 degrees outside, we chose to chill inside the large dining area near the windows - this way, we still got a nice view of the outdoor patio that borders the beautiful tree- covered walkway along the canal.  The restaurant is very \"foo-foo\" Italian dining in a casual atmosphere. I love ordering the melon salad, which is only served in summer or very hot days - lucky me. The pupu appetizer platter is enough for party of four because of the more than adequate amount of bread served with the other ingredients on the plate (prosciutto, salami, cheese, nuts, dates, etc). A favorite is the tomato/basil soup with complimentary bread and... drumroll... their homemade pesto dipping sauce. Oh drool!  The piece a la resistance was the desert.  Must must must try the oh-my-shshshut-the-door-already peanut butter mousse with smoked sea salt dentelle, topped off with a nutty, crunchy, chocolate shell. Ohhhhhh such delectable joy.  I tell you, I don't know if it was sheer relief from the heat, but boy did I ever have a most orgasmic-ly satisfying meal.  By the way, they also serve and have a good selection of wine/alcohol and beverages at the bar. Our \"tame\" party settled for raspberry drinks with ice water all around.  Great service; great food; great ambiance. May be a little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"I would like to go here but every time I try it is too busy.  One time they told me it was like a 6 hour wait???    It is pricey and 'totally upscale Scottsdale-ish'"}
{"text":"The airport seems to have a lot of junk food. It was good to find this place. I was over at B terminal and walked over to A. I had a ready made salad. I didn't realize it had bacon bits. Isn't a salad suppose to be healthy? What's with the bacon bits? The salad was OK, but I thought it was small."}
{"text":"Our last night in Arizona was at Olive and Ivy. The server was Sarah and she was excellent. The restaurant held our reservation promptly even though things were hopping on a Friday night. Food was very good too.  Cannot go wrong IMHO.  Not gourmet food, but a fun, vibrant place with good food and (for us) a great server."}
{"text":"Food was so good and so was the service.  We came here for lunch today and sat on the patio.  It was relaxing and fun. I had the lamb gyro and my husband had the pesto flatbread.  Both were tasty!"}
{"text":"This place does everything right. We had to wait for a table, no problem! The large outdoor patio has waitresses. You can  come for the drinks but you will stay for the food. Both meals I have had here rank among the greatest I have eaten anywhere. My wife, who has different taste than I, agrees. The dessert we ordered was amazing as well.   It is fancy here and you are treated like it. Excellent place."}
{"text":"Immediately seated. Free flow of fresh bread with an olive dipping to die for. Got the sweet potato cannelloni (as recommended by server). Didn't regret my decision. Others on my table got the lasagna and the flatbread which were both equally tasty. Great ambience too. Should definitely stop by if you're in the area. It's a mix of Mediterranean food with a Californian twist."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio overlooking the Scottsdale Waterfront...perfect for Sunday brunch and yummy mimosas!"}
{"text":"The waiter was great the service was awesome but finding fur with a bone in my salad while chewing is the most horrid experience I have ever had. The manager was very nice and gracious and apologetic about us finding this in our salad but that does not make up for the fact that I might get sick tonight and that I had a piece of who-knows-what in my mouth. I will never come to this establishment again. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The food and drinks are great. The outdoor patio is a great spot to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"The staff here was amazing! They were so accommodating to our large party that expanded our reservation last minute. We got multiple updates on our food from our waiter and management. The food was excellent and everyone enjoyed. We recommend the kale salad, risotto, or lasagna Bolognese."}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch while on vacation.  The food was very fresh, the outside patio was super quaint and great view on the water. Our server Matt was exceptional."}
{"text":"I sat on the patio and was served by Amanda!  She was amazing!  I am gluten free and had the bacon wrapped dates!  I'll be back for them again and the beautiful patio!"}
{"text":"We had an awesome table--right next to their big patio. So it was like we were on the patio, but had the benefit of air conditioning. Food was good, but we felt a bit rushed. It was just my husband and I and the hostess sat us at a table set for four. The waiter made it quite clear that our seat was \"prime real estate\" (yes, those were his exact words) and tried to hurry us through our dinner."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch for the first time a few weeks ago and loved it. The ambience is just so cute and classy, it made me glad I dressed up a bit that day. The wait wasn't too bad, but I was sad that the outdoor seating was closed due to rain that day. The sun did come out while we were eating though, and it is simply gorgeous out in their garden! I ordered the breakfast sandwich with egg, bacon, avocado and cheese and it was oh so yummy. The server was attentive and friendly. Hoping to come back soon for more!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite new spots in scottsdale!   First I must say, the host at the door was very pleasant and made me feel very welcome upon arrival. Olive, if you read these reviews take good care of Maddie, she's wonderful!   The service was great and the food was even better. Definitely will be a returning customer!"}
{"text":"The food and service were great! The ambiance on the back patio was beautiful. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Just had an amazing meal here. I had the salmon and my husband  had the sweet potato ravioli which was to die for. The service was great  and the outdoor seating added to the experience. Our waitress, Alexandria was a doll.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"One of the better patio's to enjoy in Scottsdale. The food is always spot on and it's close to everything in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is terrific! We had this restaurant recommended to us by friends and we were excited to try it. We had such a great dining experience tonight on our last night here in Scottsdale! We had an 8:30 reservation and arrived to have the table ready for us. They read our reservation request to be outside and they were able to seat us on the patio! The bartenders up front were so nice and they made us great cocktails while we checked in for our table. Our server Melissa is AMAZING! As soon as we sat down and were greeted by her, we knew it was going to be a great experience based on her energy. Melissa knew the menu so well and really set us up for some good decisions. We will definitely recommend this place to others! The music and vibe in the restaurant is fun and on point. The food and the drinks were excellent!"}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch at Olive & Ivy on a number of occasions, including this week.  The great service we received deserves a review.  I have always enjoyed the atmosphere at this restaurant for a business lunch - relaxed, not stuffy, not too noisy (but not too quiet), attentive staff and pretty good and affordable food.  This is why I choose it relatively frequently.  When we sat down this time our waitress had difficulty answering a question.  Immediately her colleague, who was within earshot, came over, as she was explaining that she was new on the job.  He answered the question and also assisted her throughout the meal with several other questions about what was in the food (important due to allergy issues).  As my colleague was enjoying his sandwich, he observed that there was not very much filling, although what was there tasted great.  When they came by to ask how things were, he shared that comment, to which the response was \"we'd be happy to provide more if you would like\" - very good response.  Later, when the bill came, we were told that our dessert was on the house for sharing our comments.  Totally unexpected.  An example of a great service attitude that more restaurants would be well to copy."}
{"text":"I wasn't that hungry when I came so I ordered there Cesar salad. I was expecting a pretty bland salad but I got the opposite. It was the best salad I have ever had! So much texture, flavors, and deliciousness in every single bite! The nuts and the oats added with the blue cheese just finished it off perfectly. The chicken served in it was also so moist.  I recommend this salad to anyone."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go out for a nice dinner this last Friday night and we decided on Olive & Ivy, and let me tell you this was a great decision! The food was absolutely delicious, the decor is super cute, and the service was exceptional!!! Not to mention the food was unexpectedly fast! Definitely recommend, and be returning in the future!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been a couple dozen times. Must be good, right? So we stopped in for a bite, and a pre-shopping cocktail today. There wasn't much of a crowd, and based on our experience, it is totally understandable. The food tasted just as good, leaving the service as the game changer.  I like to sit at the bar for my meals out, and I've been known to tip a shot of tequila from time to time. I'd even go so far as to say that there are no shortage of bartenders throughout the valley who know me well enough to serve me a chilled shot. No salt, no lime. EVER. Haven't had to use training wheels since the early 2000's.    I ordered a shot of Patron Silver, chilled, and before I knew it, the bartender was turning away, but I still said, no salt, no lime. He didn't acknowledge that he heard, so when my shot was served with salt around the entire rim, i assumed he had indeed not heard me. Not that big a deal, so I brushed the salt off the rim. My wife, who knows me better than anyone, said, wait! Before I knew it she had the bartender's attention, and asked for a saltless shot for me.  Here starts the slippery slope. Rather than believing the customer, our barkeep looked at me and told my wife that I had asked for salt. I'm sorry, what? I said, no, I asked for no salt no lime, to which he replied something other than okay. Basically calling me a liar.He rudely continued to argue the point  Excuse me, who the f*** are you to tell me what I said. Anyway, we were there, we were hungry, so on to faux pas number two.  We ordered a turkey hoagie to split. Having had it before, I knew it was enough for our desire to have a fairly lite lunch. I can name 50 restaurants that will bring the meal to you split in two on separate plates. Not at O&I today. We asked the guy who brought the food for an additional plate, and after he went to get one, the gem of a bartender asked, oh do you need an extra plate.  This may sound nit picky, and maybe it is. But we live in the Biltmore corridor, and there are just too many viable options for every occasion to have to put oneself through that kind of experience. Wake up O&I. You have what it takes, just show your customers a little common courtesy and respect."}
{"text":"We had an early dinner here today. Megan was our waitress and she was amazing. I have lots of dietary restrictions, and eating out is a challenge. Megan knew what was in each of the dishes and was able to make great recommendations for me, and they subbed out a vegetable I can't eat and exchanged it for some I can eat. I got the salmon and it was the best I've ever had. The rest of my party got the hummus, lamb meatballs and pesto with bread for appetizers, and flat bread, kale salad, the Mediterranean salad with shrimp and Mediterranean salad with salmon. Everyone loved their food. I would highly recommend this restaurant, and get Megan if you can. Fabulous food and amazing service!"}
{"text":"3rd time here in as many years. This has become a regular stop during our Spring Training visits. Love the location. We have sat outside which I prefer but this visit we were inside in a booth however the entire from of the dining area opens to the outside. Service was excellent and attentive. We ended up with 4 different dishes between my girlfriend and I. We started with bacon wrapped dates, good! Then the beet salad which had a wonderful variety of flavors. We shared a piccante flatbread which was great. Finally we had the mushroom Tortelli just because we had already ordered it. Despite being full from the previous items it was still fantastic. We shared a fairly cheap bottle of wine though they have a fairly large list to choose from. Thoroughly enjoyed the meal and the venue. Easy reservations and had great service."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Fox concepts. The atmosphere on the patio during the mild weather seasons is to die for! The service is always incredible.  The break and pesto before the meal is what I look forward to. I can eat just that alone! I am biased towards the veal ravioli mainly because I'm a picky eater. It is truly delicious though. The potato and prosciutto flatbread is also a must have."}
{"text":"A tad over priced, but love the chicken chop salad--I get it with Parmesan instead of blue cheese and oregano dressing soooo good!! Also the iced teas are amazing--will come just for the tea! Love love passport tea!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, drinks were good. Minus one star for the bartender that tried to over charge us for our drinks thinking we would be too buzzed to notice. Their cafe side has good mocha's."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in ages - delicious food, great atmosphere and excellent service from Zach F..  He had great recommendations and was very attentive to my table's needs without being annoying.  I will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"This is a good spot for a quick bite to eat. I always enjoy their breakfast club sandwich. You really cannot go wrong here."}
{"text":"So Wonderful!  Delicious food. Great service. Amazing ambience.  The only thing that made it not a perfect 5 stars was the bruschetta. It was a bit of a let down compared to everything else we had."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant, although it may be a chain (not sure). The food was terrific, as was the service and ambiance. We took our waiters suggestions on splitting a few salads (that we couldn't choose from) and a beef short rib flat bread. Everything was delicious. The manager was very visible and he took the time to explain their olive oil and Parmesan Reggiano  qualities. It happened to be a beautiful day and the outdoor seating was perfect. We watched a lot of dishes come out of the (open) kitchen and everything looked wonderful. I believe they really use fresh ingredients, cooked to order and beautifully presented. When visiting Scottsdale, or any of their other cities, I will absolutely return to Olive & Ivy."}
{"text":"It is definatley time for an update!  after a few dozen ++ visits since last rvw!    Loved the cooking class last week in thier intimate executive room.  Sam Fox was available throughout the evening to give updates on FRC, to answer questions, and serve food.  Was very informative, and alot of fun.  Right now, there is a drop-dead special: 3 courses for $20 - yes, you heard me right: THREE course meal for less than the cost of an entree !!  O.M.G.  can't wait to go back - again, and again, and again.  Oh, HH is now 7 days/wk !   Whoooooooooooooo :-)"}
{"text":"One of my favorites. The food is always great, service can be hit or miss but typically a really nice experience. Their bread and pesto dipping is fantastic. Sometimes you have to ask for it but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in downtown Scottsdale. Great severs and great atmosphere. The food it's amazing."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I was in Arizona, but I still remember the Olive and Ivy.  I was in Phoenix on a business trip and went out for dinner at this place with a bunch of work people based on a recommendation from a local.  We were not disappointed.  Firstly I want to say that the decor and outdoor area in this place is just fabulous.  We sat outside and enjoyed a delicious meal.  The staff were professional, welcoming and accommodating.  I enjoyed the experience so much that I brought the gf along for dinner when she arrived that weekend.  Both times I was extremely pleased with the food, drink, level of service and the ambience of the place.  5-stars for mine."}
{"text":"awesome and delicious place! good for groups!"}
{"text":"My ex fiancé and I, really enjoyed this place the food was amazing and we got to talk to the chef with our dinner. My Ex and I were both chefs in other kitchens so having a date night and getting to talk to the chef was nice. Atmosphere was great and we sat at the table looking into the kitchen."}
{"text":"After an afternoon shopping, my gf and I make dinner reservations at Olive & Ivy. Wanting to take advantage of the beautiful day, we waited for a table on the patio.   The cobblestone, foliage and water feature made the patio that much more enjoyable as we sipped our cocktails in the sun and watched people bustling about at the courtyard across the way at a festival.  When our kale salad, bruschetta and sea scallops arrived, I couldn't decide where to start! A light citrus dressing and slices of granny smith apples gave the salad a nice tartness. Of the trio of bruschetta, my fave was the sautéed mushrooms served with melted swiss - savoury deliciousness! Accompanying the sweet scallops were seared asparagus and polenta drizzled in a balsamic reduction.  You can really notice the freshness and quality of the ingredients they use here. If you want to enjoy Olive but don't have the time to sit down, they have a marketplace inside the restaurant where you can pick up things like sandwiches and fresh pressed juices - something I'll keep in mind if I want a quick snack while shopping!"}
{"text":"A beautiful place for brunch with friends. I would recommend sitting outdoors if it is a nice, sunny, and not too hot day. Sitting indoors is nice as well since the interior is all open to the outdoors.  Lots of food and drink options available for everyone, the server let us know that everything is made from scratch in house (impressive!) I ordered the table side mimosa with the smoked salmon & bagel and it was delicious! I had already snacked a lot at the farmer's market and had to take half to go, but no regrets would 100% get this again. Whatever my friends got too looked delicious (biscuits and gravy, egg sandwich, eggs Benedict, etc.) The Bloody Mary had a kick, perfect to wake you up in the morning.  What kind of was meh to me was the fact that we looked at the next table over & they got a full glass of mimosa while our table when first poured, only got maybe half a glass. Not a huge deal, but something that I saw while dining. Besides this little thing, service was great and we were in and out quickly.  Would recommend for anyone looking for a nice brunch in the area!"}
{"text":"The Sicilian pizza was awesome, and the workers are friendly and helpful. Best service I've received at any airport"}
{"text":"The food, service, and ambiance was great.  Came here on a recommendation from a sales guy at Neimans, and it did not disappoint.  Will definitely come back the next time im in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Food was okay, atmosphere outside was kind of loud.  I had the lamb pita and it came out cold, but was ok overall. I dont live in AZ so I am not able to return, but I would go back for dinner since its a bigger menu and would be cooler outside."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food and service at this restaurant - it has now become our \"go-to\" place for all celebrations! Staff goes above and beyond, and the menu is eclectic enough that everyone we have gone with (been different each time) never has a problem finding something yummy to eat."}
{"text":"We were attempting to have a sandwich. Spent 30 dollars on sandwiches. There were patrons (kids, sky harbor employees) that were incredibly OBNOXIOUS , loud, disruptive, using filthy language sitting behind us. We gave it a try, they continued, relentless with their awful behavior. We told the manager of Olive and Ivy and they just smiled and snickered. We left. Wasted our money and food to escape their behavior. I hope Olive and Ivy know that their name is attached to this establishment poorly run! I live in Phoenix/Scottsdale and will never go to an Olive and Ivy again."}
{"text":"For those travelers looking for a quick bite to eat, but prefer something fresher than your regular airport Chili's, look at the new Olive and Ivy located across from Gate A4 in Terminal 4. Last year the City of Phoenix made a great decision when renewing their food service contracts to push vendors to bring in versions of local restaurants found thought the Valley. Here at Olive and Ivy, you'll find a fresh panini or two (recommend the Pastrami), a few salads and select coffee drinks made to order."}
{"text":"We decided to visit after the crushbrew festival. The music and decor lured us in. We were quickly seated in the outside area, service was fast and friendly. We ordered the lamb meatballs and a pasta dish. The food was delicious, tasty and at a great temperature. Definitely something to try another night when we aren't tired of drinking/walking all day... Perfect for a nice date-night."}
{"text":"Bartender who took our order didn't do anything the hour we were there. He made some new guy make all the drinks and the new guy asking waitresses what garnishes go on which drink. He should be asking the bartender. I can get a better old fashioned in a dive bar."}
{"text":"Great spot, good food.  Sam Fox is some kind of genius."}
{"text":"Our waiter introduced the restaurant as a Mediterranean/Italian restaurant with a twist. As best I can tell, the \"twist\" was the lack of Italian dishes on the menu!  Good drinks, great food, prompt service and a nice atmosphere at Scottsdale prices - need I say more?"}
{"text":"Impressed yet again by another Fox Concept Restaurant. This place is amazing! Julia, our server, was super sweet and beyond accommodating. The next time we come in we will definitely be looking forward in sitting in her section again. The food was amazing!! We got the jalapeño cilantro hummus as an appetizer (yum!) and as an entree we got the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin cooked to perfection! The dish was beautiful and they even split it for us! We also split the chicken pesto pizza. The chicken is shredded inside the pesto and even came with pine nuts! It was amazing! Before they entree they give you complimentary bread and pesto with olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette. Oh, and get the Strawberry & Thyme cocktail; you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"We were lucky to secure a reservation for a private room to celebrate our daughter's graduation (ASU!) at this fabulous restaurant!  The banquet coordinator was excellent and worked closely with us throughout the planning process. Her suggestions were spot on and resulted in some of the highlights of the evening.  Even after the party got underway we were able to make some significant changes and the coordinator and staff were gracious and accommodating.  Our service that evening was beyond our expectations and the food was truly divine.  I can't say enough good things about our experience.  Just wish I kept a list of all the names of the terrific folks that helped make our party a complete success!  Don't hesitate to book a special event or dinner at Olive & Ivy. Be sure to order any of their flatbreads, their amazing scallops, and/or their tender steaks.  And don't miss their antipasti...the best presentation and so delicious!"}
{"text":"Dined outside. It's a must do when the weather is right. Fit's nicely into the 'Fashion Square' mentality an aura. Great appetizers and they did a great job on the steak. We'll go back again sometime."}
{"text":"My lovely bride and I visited on a nearly perfect day in Scottsdale (not hard to find).  We had lunch around 2:00 on a Friday and were astounded how busy the restaurant was but soon learned why that was the case.  Enjoyed an ice cold Peroni along with their bread and pesto dipping sauce.  Just ridiculously good.  I literally could have had the bread for lunch.  Light, airy, slightly salty.  Pesto was perfection.  We then shared the Mediterranean Salad and Chicken Pannini.  Salad was very, very good.  The Pannini was literally one of the best sandwiches I have wolfed down in a very long time.  Moist, simple, filling.  Unreal.   We found the service to be very solid.  Friendly, attentive but not intrusive.  There is not question that we will return.  The nice part is I already know what to order, as well."}
{"text":"Awesome service and environment.  Our waiter was well informed and friendly. Had sweet potato CANNELLONI the taste was a combination of dinner and dessert. It was too much of one thing.  Maybe served as a side or for sharing would be good.  The spicy shrimp RISOTTO was good but not spicy at all. Overall good quality food and lovely ambiance. Has unique food not found at other restaurants. Would recommend to a friend"}
{"text":"I came here with a work group after Cowboy Ciao lost our reservation and were pretty well taken care of on short notice. Check the website, the atmosphere is pretty swank. Huge space with a lot of thought put into it...neat-o. The service was absolutely excellent, and we never had to ask/wait for anything.   Now the food... not too bad, but not amazing. We had a global group of visitors (Sydney, NYC, London, Chicago, Dublin) and everyone was happy with the choices, and what they ordered. Decent value for the money, but not overly memorable. On the plus side, the wine list was extensive and fairly diverse, so we were quite happy with that. The cocktails were creative, but all the ones I tried slanted a bit to the sweet side on balance (not a bad idea for mass appeal).  P.S. Cowboy Ciao was pretty accommodating. Their manager got on the phone and arranged for a group of 10 to walk in to Olive & Ivy with no notice, so I appreciated the effort."}
{"text":"I expected this to be good because their regular restaurant in Scottsdale is good.  It was early morning so the Irish Oats sounded good.  Not sure what is Irish about them (I was expecting Irish Steel cut) as they really seem like normal Quaker Oats and definitely were not Irish Steel Cut).  They were severely undercooked, and barely warm.  The wait staff was quite friendly and helpful and immediately offered to replace the item with something else, which is why I gave 2 stars instead of one.  So the repacement was eggs, bacon and potatoes.  The dish seemed like it had been prepared well in advance and had just been sitting.  It was not very appetizing.  I gave two stars instead of 1 because they tried to make it right and I appreciate that.  Perhaps translsating from an upscale restaurant to an airport concession is not easy.  Not sure."}
{"text":"I come here for the pancakes once a week and now they are gone. Bring them back please! #disappointed"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this restaurant was great, very spacious. The food was delicious. Our table was under a vent which made it very uncomfortable to eat. Service was pretty good. Would love to go back to this place sometime but also enjoy trying new places."}
{"text":"Great place. The food was fresh and delicious. Not the biggest selection ever, but I can see their \"quality not quantity\" motto. The brushetta is amazing and I love the fresh focaccia ad pesto they bring to the table. Great service and their sangria ROCKS!!!"}
{"text":"After my last review, the manager of Olive and Ivy contacted me and asked us to give them another try.  He apologized for the poor service. I am so glad he took an interest in our comments and asked us to return. This latest visit definitely rates 5 stars. We again sat outside on the patio that overlooks the canal. It was perfect. The service was excellent and the waiter was very attentive without hovering. The food was perfect. My husband ordered the rib-eye steak and said it was cooked to perfection and very tender. I ordered two vegetarian appetizers, hummus with vegetables and the flatbread. The margherita flatbread rates among the best I have ever eaten.  I am so glad we were asked to give this establishment a second visit. The outside atmosphere and location makes it a favorite of ours to take out of town guests."}
{"text":"After hearing good things about this place, I finally made it here for lunch.  Unfortunately, it was after the menu change so I was expecting different choices.  Upon entering, the first thing I noticed was that there wasn't much space to sit.  There were maybe 5 small tables near the ordering counter and just as much at the patio.  This was a fast casual place(you order at the counter but they'll bring food out to you).  The menu was somewhat small.  You get to pick between pizza, salad, or sandwich.  I decided on a gyro and my bf got the corn pizza.  Since we wanted to sit inside, we decided to go past the ordering counter to see if there were any tables there.  I was skeptical since all I could see was the kitchen and waitstaff in that area, but it turned out there was a ton of restaurant seating that you can't see when you go in.  We weren't sure if we were suppose to sit there since it looked more formal, but we did anyway.  The food came within a reasonable amount of time and it was decent.  My gyro was generously portioned.  The pickle that came with my gyro could have been more crisp and the tzatziki sauce was pretty bland.  The corn pizza was also a generous portion and seemed quite good from the bite I got.  My main dislike of this place was the layout.  Seating shouldn't be hidden in the back.  The food is slightly pricey and none of the menu items jumped out at me.  I'd describe this place as underwhelming.  At least this place has underground parking."}
{"text":"I understand! I do! I get it that I'm a 22 year old guy that doesn't look like he could tell the difference between caviar and cold salty bean dip, but honestly when I went out for a nice sweet date night with my bangin' girlfriend, we had no idea that we were doomed to be shoved into the day care section at the haughtiest country club this side of Cafe la Ritz.   Everything felt good as our hostess walked us back through the crowded dining room. However, the fuzziness in the pit of my stomach soon morphed itself into a dull pooing sensation as we were plopped down at a table next to another set of young diners. Soda pop and water was on their table, and sexual tension (theirs) was in the air as we lifted our menus to let our eyes feast on the over priced menu.   Our service was fine, with the exception of a few awkward mishaps with our ID's, but the real issue was the food. Maybe it's just my misunderstanding of fine dining, but I thought that really good food was always served in small portions(because of the high quality ingredients, which in turn are high price ingredients) but tasted really really AWESOME. Olive and ivy only accomplished half of this with their veal and spinach ravioli. Wow, I didn't know that chef boyardee could be sold for 14 dollars. It was so bland, super under cooked and needed a serious hit of salt.   On the upside, I got a Sausage and mushroom pizza that was pretty good, but not amazing. Hand tossed...meh. Fennel Sausage...okay. This is one of the top five pizza topping combos and SHOULD be totally delicious every time. But I still think their are better places to get some killer sausage and mushroom pizza for a way better price.   On the way upside, my girlfriend got the red wine sangria and it was delicious. Smooth and sweet, but not too sweet like fruit punch or some crap. It still had the taste of wine, which rocks, but it was soooo cold and fruity and refreshing.   All in all, it was just alright. Maybe I expected too much. Maybe I thought that I could have the perfect restaurant experience. Ambiance, good food, good service. I guess that when things don't go right it gives me something to talk about, complain about, moan about. Like the right wing, or bad ranch dressing."}
{"text":"Amazing ambience with a killer seat yourself patio and fireplaces (first come first serve. Make friends with someone on be couches and join their party). Great service. Ordered seasonal chef board and ate every crumb. Prosciutto, cherry compote, olives pistachios, focaccia, and a homemade rosemary butter. Worth it for a light dinner or heavy snack. Service delightful."}
{"text":"Pretentious is the one word that comes to mind while dining here.  Pros: 1. Vegetarian options 2. Delicious 3. Even though it is pretentious it is \"Scottsdale Pretentious\" meaning you can come in with jeans and a nice top and you'll be seated. 4. They allow substitutes and exclusions. I ordered the kale salad (yummy!) but wanted it without bacon and it was no problem. I have been to places with the whole \"No. We are making it the way the chef wants\" this is not one of those places.   Cons: 1. Its pretentious 2. It's a Fox Restaurant meaning it is a restaurant group. If you want a local, independent restaurant with vision of some struggling kids putting themselves through culinary school and opening up a restaurant and that the profit goes to their children softball and dance classes well this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Expensive, definitely, but I would say worth it.  The strong points in my opinion are the flatbread pizza, the booze, and the gelato.  I've been there several times and the only entree I remember was the flatbread pizza so that might be a bad thing I guess?  The store attached to the restaurant has some great stuff.  Definitely has that Scottsdale vibe going on, but I enjoyed it anyway.  They serve AWESOME french toast for breakfast."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. The artichoke appetizer was spot on delicious. The rib eye steak was cooked perfectly and the veal ravioli was a nice light meal. Oh the pesto they serve with the bread was my favorite very yummy!"}
{"text":"What a lovely restaurant! Tonight was my second Olive & Ivy happy hour and it did not disappoint! I kid you not I've been dreaming about the strawberry bruschetta for a week! Everything is super fresh and quickly served, and the wait staff are lovely.  Thank you to our waitress who got my to-go order of lamb meatballs expedited since my boyfriend was home sick. He enjoyed them a lot and will be joining us next happy hour for the bruschetta and truffle fries!"}
{"text":"The food and service were wonderful.  We loved the out-door seating area.  However, we spent more money for the meal that I'd like."}
{"text":"Wow...amazing breakfast, love this place. Had a sausage breakfast sandwich on a homemade English muffin, who knew? Love the decor, the open kitchen, and the staff. Very friendly place!! Great job!!!"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for a business trip recently and enjoyed a dinner here on Saturday, 5/20/17; in short, it was fabulous!  There were three of us, and we were seated in a half round booth with a view of the terrace/patio.  It's clean, modern and the service was fantastic; our server was knowledgeable and his smile was genuine, and since this was our first time there we all had questions which he answered cheerfully.  We started with the Humus plate, and the Humas is made from scratch (as is their bread and pasta) and it was the best I've ever had.  Never had scratch made pita before this, and what a difference!  One gal had the Mushroom Ravioli which she was thrilled with, my other companion had the Sea Bass which she adored.  I had the Shrimp Scampi Risotto; the shrimp was tender and perfectly cooked, and Risotto was creamy, delicious and melted in my mouth!!  Even their Iced Tea was wonderful!!!  The only negative is that it's a bit loud and hard to hear each other which made us all raise our voices.  If you're anywhere near Scottsdale, you have to go to Olive & Ivy!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place to sit outside in good weather and good friends for cocktails and appetizers."}
{"text":"Wow from the moment I walked in the door until I left, I was impressed with their customer service and the food. The bartenders really know their cocktails, I would try the margaritas, they are great!!"}
{"text":"Guaranteed satisfaction!!! The gyro is huge, but delicious (I can never finish it), it is on the lunch menu. In the evenings my favorite dish is the sea scallops with polenta and brussel sprouts (some times the brussel sprouts are not available due to seasonality, they will have an optional veggie).  I also love their kale salad and the hummus.   The customer service is always good and consistent."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Old Town! The staff here are absolutely amazing, and I have never had a bad experience! Always friendly, kind, and willing to go above and beyond expectations to provide excellent service! Brandon, Calay, Nick, Amber, Zak, John, Meca, Jake, Stefan, Dan, Zane, Easton, Jeff - YOU GUYS ARE INCREDIBLE! Every time I walk in the door, you guys are like family! (Sorry to anyone I missed!) Been coming here for years and of course the food is always ABOVE & BEYOND just like the service!   All of my friends and family that I bring in always feel so welcomed and rave about the incredible service. Thank you all so much! Olive will always be a top pick for me and anyone visiting from out of town!  Food favs: lamb meatballs, veal & spinach ravioli, chicken pesto flatbread, & mediterranean salad with salmon!"}
{"text":"Really cool vibe, solid service, and great food.  I really dig the flat bread appetizers, in particular.  Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and had potential but service is marginal and hostess was no help.  I was there for a business meeting and was seated at a very dirty outdoor seating area.  They indicated they did not have a two top table available but this was on a Wednesday afternoon and did not look busy.  I would not recommend for business and expect slow and uncaring service."}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy's foods and drinks are amazing, also the restaurants atmosphere is very warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"Great place to chill and dine with their nice patio. The service was great. The food was delicious and appropriately priced."}
{"text":"I've been to Olive & Ivy three times and each experience has been flawless. The food is EXCELLENT, the service is good and the ambience and setting are some of the best in Scottsdale. The outdoor patio overlooking the canal is lovely even on hot summer nights and the inside dining room is classy and full of understated character.   The restaurant does fill up on weekends, so be sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Fantastic place.  Lucked out when a table opened up as soon as we arrived (I asked about the wait time for sitting outside, it was 3 hours...).  Bread & Pesto = amazing. Bruschetta = amazing. Natural Chicken = Very good.  Bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin = amazing.  Beautiful restaurant, great location, terrific service.  You are missing out if you don't try this place."}
{"text":"You'll Be Disappointed  Very attractive restaurant belies terrible service and worse food preparation and presentation.  My advice -- stay away, there are lots better places in Scottsdale and environs.  Waiter started out by lauding the size of various salads, entrees, etc.  Touted as very splitable. We split the prawn risotto. A dollop of risotto, covered by 2 prawns each.  That 4th prawn was an extra charge.  Friends split the lasagne.  We all know what a slice of lasagne should look like.  The split portions were served in a cup the size of a small custard cup.  But each had a slice of bread attached to this sumptuous presentation!  The restaurant should have been embarrassed to have brought such a joke to the table.    A third friend sent her seared tuna entree back twice.  It was served ice cold each time. They gave up and just took it off the bill.  The days of free dessert to atone for bad food and service are long gone.  This place is a culinary joke.  Don't waster your time and money.  You'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came to Scottsdale for a bachelorette and we had dinner here the first night. The place was packed when we got there! There was a DJ playing and people were fully enjoying themselves with the happy hour/bar area.   We sat at a table in the main seating area, right by the patio (so cute!). We started with a lot of appetizers The appetizers were SO good. The various bruschettas we got, as well as the salads were great. but that duck confit flatbread - OMG TO DIE FOR.    All of the entrees were also excellent although after all of the appetizers, we opted to share entrees given the size of each of the dishes! The salmon was cooked to perfection and SO fresh. The sea bass - definitely great.    My onnnlllyyyyy complaint is the scallops. They were cooked TO PERFECTION, but they had an overbearing sweet sauce that completely ruined the dish.   Overall, I was disappointed given my obsession with scallops but would definitely come back here again given how great everything else was."}
{"text":"I live in Scottsdale and this is easily one of my favorite restaurants! Everything is top notch; the food, cocktails, service, ambiance, etc. I have never had a less than wonderful experience here. I love coming here for brunch or dinner. Some of my favorites are the bruschetta (mozzerella is the best), the scallops, chicken scallopini, and bacon wrapped dates, and for brunch the ivy sausage sandwich and the smoked salmon."}
{"text":"Stopped in as my hotel was close by while I was in town on business.  Started off with a great salad. The amount of fresh ingredients was fantastic and did not disappoint. The dressing was not over powering!  For dinner I had the sea bass off the menu. The presentation was very good but I felt like the fish lacked seasoning. It tastes very plain when eaten on its own. But when comings with the other ingredients on the plate it was better but did failed to deliver a WOW factor for a main course.  After the great salad I was expecting the main course to deliver awesomeness. I was disappointed.  Would I be back..meh! Not sure someone would have to twist my arm!"}
{"text":"Let me start out with ambiance: The patio is gorgeous very Mediterranean garden feeling and located at the Waterfront which adds to a peaceful Meal. I gave it a 4 star as I have gluten allergy and couldn't believe that they didn't offer Gluten free bread or pasta like Postino. I ordered fritto misto which was crispy and delicious calamari mixed with zucchini. I added the very ,arugula goat cheese salad half size and was in heaven. My hubby had the lasagna bolognese which he enjoyed very much . For dessert we had chocolate ganache which was too dry for my taste not chocolaty enough  All in All great experience,prices reasonable for lunch. We will be back"}
{"text":"Dinner was delicious!  The appetizers, or small plates, as they are referred to on the menu, offered interesting possibilities.  I recommend the fritto misto - a combo of calamari, rock shrimp and zucchini - fantastic!  The beet salad was also quite delicious.  For my entree, I chose the lobster risotto.  It was tasty, though a tad bit salty.  Admittedly, I have some regrets about having such a rich dinner, but that was my bad, not a reflection on the restaurant lol.     I loved the decor and vibe at Olive & Ivy.  It's a trendy Scottsdale restaurant, for sure, but it didn't have that pretentious air about it.  I found the waiter very attentive and helpful with questions about the menu and area.  I guess I'm a real fan of the Fox concept restaurants.  I've enjoyed all the ones I've visited, thus far."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night.  Wasn't expecting loud DJ music.  Food was well prepared.  Service was friendly, informative, and timely."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Beautiful place to go for dinner. Their Atlantic salmon and bacon wrapped dates were especially good!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant - atmosphere and staff service.  Really big menu, so many options.  Exceptional outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"The Fox family of restaurants hits another home run on this concept!   Great food and service as usual from this great restaurant company.   Very hip and cool setting on the Scottsdale waterfront.  Great patio!"}
{"text":"I always have high expectations from the Fox Restaurants, and Olive & Ivy did not disappoint.  My mom and I went in for lunch, meeting my mother-in-law, sister-in-law, and her mother.  We came in the wrong door (the entrance for the attached marketplace) and tried to follow the signs to the hostess, but the signs ended before we found her.  An understanding server, who has probably seen this happen a lot, found us and pointed us in the right direction.  I ordered the tuna salad sandwich, and it was delicious.  Crispy warm toast, creamy tuna salad, fresh greens and a side of fries made for a lunch I wish I could replicate at home.  Our server expertly handled the special requests for our table, which pleased those who were avoiding gluten, dairy, or both.  My only complaint about the visit was that the music was a bit loud for the middle of the day.  Other patrons were raising their voices to be heard above it, creating even more noise.  It was nearly impossible to have a conversation with anyone not sitting directly next to, or across from me.  I can't help but notice restrooms in restaurants.  The ladies room here is very nice, with cute little touches that I was taking note of for my own home!  It was clean and well decorated, which is always a good sign, if you ask me.    I'd love to return for brunch or dinner and sample more of the menu.  For lunch, it definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after a referral from a local shop owner.  Couldn't be happier with the food and service. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable, friendly and genuinely seemed to enjoy his job and the restaurant.  Very reasonably priced and the food was delicious.  We will definitely return and look forward to their dinner menu. Would recommend this restaurant to anyone in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service this morning! The french toast is to die for! It was cooked to perfection with what tasted like REAL maple syrup! Definitely ask for the fruit topping on the side though. It's overwhelmingly sweet and would probably make the french toast a bit soggy.  We also ordered a lox bagel which was delicious! The bagel was toasted just right along with a lovely array of toppings including a whipped cream cheese, salmon, capers, and sliced tomatoes. YUM!  So I had to update this since I just opened my left overs.. I usually prefer to box things up myself at restaurants for this reason: The rest of my french toast was thrown in with the fruit sauce and is now ruined. :( The worst part is that there is no side of maple syrup! I had plenty left when they took my plate.. How am I supposed to eat this???"}
{"text":"I am currently finishing up an incredible meal. Literally still in the restaurant, but I can't wait to post this. Not because of the food (though that was delish), but because of our server, Clenard.  We came in, sat for maybe ten minutes, when he came over, profusely apologized for our wait, and informed us he'd be getting us bruschetta on the house. Then, as we proceeded to order, he was incredibly attentive and helpful. My friend got around four Arnold palmers, and he kept them coming!! He was cordial, kind and incredibly professional. Then we also received dessert on the house (for a wait that, honestly, was NOT bad). Everyone was wonderful, and I'm sure clenard is a reflection of the entire staff and restaurant.   Because of this amazing server (and, not to forget, an awesome meal of the lamb meatballs and artichoke heart salad) I am set on being a regular here.  I've never leave reviews but because of the quality of service and meal, I must. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! it's good for groups or for intimate dates as well. I particularly loveeeeee the patio!! it's right on the waterfront with all the lights and fountains so this is one of my to-go places for romantic dates. their food's very good too and wine list isn't bad either. I haven't had anything there that i was disappointed at. Definitely will be keep going back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has real quality food. The food tastes great and the ambience is nice. The only thing that I wish they could change is to have their waiter come by our table less. The waitress literally came by our table asking:  \"Is everything all right?\" at least 8 times. Just a tad bit less would be fine."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were staying at the Phoenician and went to Olive and Ivy by their recommendation. Good fresh food. Fun vibe and wonderful service!"}
{"text":"I ate at Olive and Ivy on Dec 5th about 1pm. My server was Casey. he was amazing. he was so cheerful and knowledgeable. It was only his 2nd day. I hope he is there when I go next time."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of O & I is so perfect for a double date with some good friends. Very good food and drinks and the service was perfect. Will remind you of a coastal place in California in both atmosphere and food. We all enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here on Friday for the first time. Place was rocking with loud music and good looking people. The service I had was phenomenal..probably one of the best servers Ive ever had. I wish I knew his name but knew we wanted to take out time sharing dishes. He was on point recommending small plates and entrees. The bacon wrapped dates were delicious."}
{"text":"I think I got unlucky.  The atmosphere is great, and the menu sounds amazing from all the reviews.  I went on a Saturday night and got a great booth.  The bread was delicious, as all the reviews state.  I ordered the bacon wrapped dates and the veal ravioli.  The bacon wrapped dates didn't really have much flavor to it.  The texture was great - crispy bacon around a soft, chewy date...but there needs to be some sort of sauce with this to bring out the flavors of the dates.  The veal ravioli was a fail - twice.  The first time they brought it out, the center of the ravioli was cold!  The sauce was warm and quite delicious.  I sent it back, (service was extremely polite), and when it came back, the food was hot, but the pasta shell of the ravioli was undercooked and hard.  I didn't want to send it back a 2nd time, so I just ate it.  The drinks were good - I had a pitcher of white sangria, and some wine."}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix we happened upon this fabulous restaurant with amazing food and service! Josh P., our incredible server, gave excellent advice on the menu and knew the perfect balance for taking care of us without hovering.  The ambiance was perfect!  The bruschetta was outstanding... The artichoke \"small plate\" had great flavor.....the focaccia and pesto was absolutely delicious.  Then the main courses...we had three: the chicken scallipini, sea bass, and sweet potato cannelloni.  Every taste was a work of art!   Kuddos to chef Chris and his team of culinary artists...and to Josh P. for making the meal more like an EVENT.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Had Brunch here yesterday with my friend and it was amazing! The service was impressive! My friend ordered Diet Coke and they brought her out a bottle of Diet Coke and poured it for her at the table as they only have Diet Pepsi on tap. I thought this was above and beyond.  Our server was Easton and he was the best! He was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. We loved his suggestions. His positive energy was contagious. Not once did I run out of water or my drink. They were on top of it. The atmosphere and decor is really pretty awesome as well. I will definitely return here and recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Had a reservation for a large party on Sunday afternoon for lunch - had 5 tables which were served by individual waiters. Had to wait a very long time (about 30 min) before the waiter came by to take our drink order, ordered food at the same time.   Didn't see the waiter again until the food came, got a vegetable frittata which was very undersized for what it cost ($11) but did have good flavor and was gluten free as noted on their menu.   Never saw the waiter again until bill time, and I had wanted a second drink. At that point, every single person at the other tables had paid and started leaving before our waiter even came back to give us our bills. Worst part - I was automatically charged an 18% tip for terrible service.   While i understand that waitstaff should be fairly compensated for handling a large party, this waiter was responsible for 2 tables, not a very hefty work investment. That I couldn't elect not to tip when given bad service was an insult on top of it all."}
{"text":"One of the best patios in Scottsdale.  Great stop on an afternoon of day drinking.   Recommend the side where you seat yourself.  One thing that gets me is that they change their menu every few hours.  It goes from brunch to some sort of mid-afternoon selection then to the whole dinner menu.  I find it annoying but the great service and relaxed vibe keeps me coming back.  Luckily I rarely order food.  When I do, the bruscetta trio is stellar."}
{"text":"Unique and fun place to eat! You walk in to a little café with a refrigerated drink area across from an espresso stand which is next to a large pastry case. You walk further back to a very large and industrial mid century modern with antique accent open room where the restaurant is. The way the kitchen is set up you can sit at a bar and watch them cook or across the room you can sit around their drink bar. We sat in the main dining room and split a lamb gyro which was delicious! I know it was a fluke but I ordered the gyro and literally within two minutes it arrived at our table. The fries were also on point. The outside dining had a lovely view and the overall ambience was very enjoyable and impressive."}
{"text":"Great place to go on a Friday night! Make a reservation though this place gets busy. Loved everything we ate. Great fungi bruschetta, margarita flatbread, and natural chicken with mushrooms and potatoes gnocchi. Yum! Great Chardonnay too"}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times and I love it!!!  I love the cool decor and the little market.  I like the patio area..but mostly I love their red sangria..mmm...you can buy it by the pitcher!!  I have always found everyone working there to treat us with great service...It is a favorite lunch spot of mine!"}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy is such a unique restaurant that I frequent for Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and Drinks.  I have a spa business at the Waterfront, so the marketplace is awesome for Coffee, the Egg Sandwich or just grabbing a naked juice togo.  The patio's are great for people-watching.  I also appreciate that the staff (Jillian, Cory, Klaus, etc.) remember me, what I ordered, that I haven't been in 3 weeks!  FOXRC has the midas touch as far as their ideas, locations, concepts.  Your wondering about the 4 stars?   Shoulder to shoulder, vying to get a drink, more men than women, it's the price you have to pay occasionally."}
{"text":"I love eating at olive and ivy! It's great for a refreshing breakfast or date night! I always get the Mediterranean salad, but you really can't go wrong here! If you are in the area, it's a must have!"}
{"text":"Amazing Interior and food- CANNOT SAY THAT about SERVICE! HORRIBLE SERVICE almost every time we have gone there- We had to flag people every time to get food, drinks- anything- ONE waitress quit and went home and NO one took over her section- (US)- But food is good- and inside gets better service than the outside-   If you want Amazing ALL- Go to Sanctuary resort- Elements restaurant-  Been to many times- A++++ every time!   4th time there- STILL HORRIBLE......sheesh ...service, service, service!!!! Food is fine- interior great- PLEASE UP-TUNE THE SERVICE!!!!!!!!not enough wait staff and very snooty hostesses... baby...I am wearing good, hot swag...dont look me up and down just cause you got walmart clothes on... :)"}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful lighting, gorgeous huge outdoor patio, fantastic brunch, and one of my favorite places to take out-of-towners. Great for groups, and a perfect \"you just can't go wrong\" restaurant. Literally, date, folks in town, girls brunch, afternoon happy hour with the kids, you name it, this place will do it perfectly!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. My favorite spot in Phoenix so far!   P.S.   Their focaccia bread and pesto sauce is to DIE for. You can also buy this at the bakery to bring home. Too bad they do not sell their other baked breads..."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here. Great place to eat. Vibrant Bar Scene, Fit for Foodies, Great for Outdoor Dining, Late-Night Find, Neighborhood Gem, Notable Wine List, Romantic, Special Occasion, Scenic View, Great for Lunch, Hot Spot"}
{"text":"I had to take some clients out for dinner yesterday and asked my wife for some eatery ideas.  She suggested this place which I never heard of and I must admit I jumped to some negative conclusions.  I expected to find a pretentious, small portioned, over priced cafe next to the \"Scottsdale Ditch\" (sorry I meant to say Riverfront) where the seen and want to be seen hang.  When we showed up not a lot of big surprises.  There is parking for about a dozen cars on the cul du sac for all of the shops but never fear there is the trusty valet who has already coned most of them off  (is that even legal?) and will happily park your car for six bucks a throw.  Sorry, I digress.  It's just one of my pet peaves.  To be fair the restaurant decour was a pleasant surprise.  Very contemporary; open room, high ceiling with an outside patio next to the ditch... uh river.  The restaurant was about half full which was a departure from most of the others in the area which were empty.  I mean like not one party inside!  We were seated in a back room with floor to ceiling window views looking out on the patio and river.  Now you can't exactly see the river from the restaurant cause they planted bushes on the edge of the patio.  I'm paying a premium for a water front experience... where's my water?  I read about lousy service here but ours was OK.  They kind of figured we were here to spend corporate money on a big party so they were  tip motivated.  The general impression from around the table was that the food was excellent, portions were ok, prices kind of high but what do you expect in that area?  The wine list is extensive and pricey and the sommelier is well schooled in spending your money.  With my thirsty crew I was looking in the two figure column and he was making three figure suggestions.  Ouch!  Bottom line.  I would return to Olive & Ivy but maybe in the fall so I can sit on the patio and get a peek at the beautiful Scottsdale river."}
{"text":"I always have a great meal here! My boyfriend and I love to stroll around Scottsdale and stop here for a quick bite. I typically get a mushroom pasta and bruschetta. If the main seating area is full trying sitting to the far left in the lounge. They serve the same menu but it is first come."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place! The water was very friendly, all the food was of high quality and amazing taste, and the restaurant itself is just awesome! Very trendy and chic. The interior decor is very nicely done and the outdoor terrace is absolutely gorgeous. I highly recommend any of their flatbreads, pastas, or salads. All are great. Same goes to desserts! This place is definitely worth checking out if you're in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"I've been at this place many times and is one of my favorite spots to meet friends in Old Town; every time they had offered a good experience regardless of time, number of people or how busy they are.   Restaurant is in a prime location of Old Town, you can get there from both sides of the bridge (parking garages are close) or they have valet if you prefer that. Both the patio and the inside areas have a nice atmosphere. Good Service. Good Food"}
{"text":"I'm jealous that we don't have Olive & Ivy in Denver....  My friend and I hadn't planned on going here last week, but after getting lost on our way somewhere else we wound up here.   It was a hopping Saturday night and everyone looked very dressed up. All ages filled the restaurant. We got lucky with 2 lounge chairs outside. There were limited seats and they are 1st come 1st serve and beware of couples making out.  We loved the Braised Short Rib flat bread with Caramelized Onions & Gorgonzola. I wish we knew how big it was going to be as we didn't need the Prosciutto di Parma Bruschetta with Crescenza Cheese, Arugula & Fig Preserves. But we love everything in front of us.  And their Red Raspberry Mojito was fabulous to look at and drink. Enjoy my pictures."}
{"text":"One of my favorites if not favorite restaurant in old town / waterfront area. Always busy so be sure to get a reservation! Some favorites include the chopped salad and the bruschetta boards. Also the complimentary bread w/ pesto is a plus! If you're going in the cooler months / spring try to sit on the patio! The little café at the front is great too for grab and go breakfast items like croissants and coffee."}
{"text":"Favorite place we went to in Scottsdale. Great food, amazing wine list, and I would suggest getting some share plates. Absolutely fell in love with the meatballs and savory pasta dish. Service was great.  Fabulous cocktails. Will come back again!!"}
{"text":"In a great location, came here for dinner while visiting Scottsdale for a girls' trip. Without a reservation, we were still seated within 30 minutes which isn't bad for a Friday night or for 5 guests. The inside ambiance is fantastic. Lanterns hung so it looks like they are floating, great mood lighting, open kitchen... Mediterranean feel to the decor and drinks. Great start for our Friday night out.  Mediterranean food always sounds great to my friends and I but O&I's menu seemed more Italian influenced. As others mentioned, the bread and pesto is delicious. The portion sizes are large for my friends and I opted to split entrees. To be honest, I don't even remember the vegetarian option I ate (something wit mushrooms) because all I can remember is how amazing the pumpkin cannelloni is (which our other friends got).  Definitely reservations if you can. With a centralized location, it's easily a great place to start your night off in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is huge and on a weekend definitely requires a reservation. We were lucky enough to walk in and take a table due to cancellation.   The size does not affect the service, our server was very prompt in checking in on us throughout our time there.   I ordered the chicken Scallopini which says it comes with prosciutto but I didn't see nor taste it, I also would have liked to know it was breaded or I wouldn't have ordered it. Nonetheless the chicken was good as well as the spinach. I was also surprised to find there wasn't any grain to go with it however it was filling and good the way it came.   My sister ordered the pesto chicken flatbread, the pesto was good however It could have used more chicken. Just like in pizza there should be one of every topping in each bite.  My other sister ordered Blue Cheese salad which was large and she said quite good.   Overall it was ok, for the price the portions were not up to par. Our service was excellent and the place is cool however from 6:30-8 on a Thursday the music was super loud so it was hard to have a conversation as well."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here last night with some friends that were in town from Minnesota and once again this place didn't let me down!   My favorite part of Olive & Ivy has got to be the stunning patio! Seriously, don't even bother sitting inside. The patio is worth it even in the middle of the AZ summer heat, thats how pretty it is. I always get the Margarita Flat Bread and it is to die for. My boyfriend gets the Veil and Spinach Ravioli and loves it every time as well (I can't vouch for this one though, seeing as Veil is not my thing).  I have only ever had one issue with any food I have tasted here and that was my starter from last night. I chose to start with a cup of their soup of the day - Broccoli Cheddar. I don't know about you, but when I envision Broccoli Cheddar Soup, I envision orange, cheesy soup with a ton of chunks of Broccoli. The consistency of this soup could be compared to water, no chunks of broccoli and was green! I have never seen green broccoli cheddar soup. Honestly think they just pureed broccoli together, added water and a little bit of cheese and called it a day. I would definitely pass on this next time it is available.   Other than that, our guests loved the suggestion and we loved it to. Will be back time and time again!"}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour with a friend and enjoyed it! I've heard good stuff about this place and was happy to say that I too was pleased with the food and drinks! We ordered the butternut squash bruschetta & margarita flatbread, which was good.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was attentive when we first arrived, but forgot about us as the night continued. My friend eventually got up to find our bartender, so we could order another drink. The bartenders were friendly though just slow. Overall, it's a super cute restaurant with tasty food and good drink specials for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the restaurant is a really nice space which is why it got two stars instead of one.  After being seated we waited ten minutes before anyone even came over to get a drink order or give us water, and it was a server from another section that felt bad for us.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that literally nothing was good which is why I don't feel the need to go into more detail.  I had much higher hopes given the ratings here, and so I write this in the hopes that possibly even one person will be spared the same experience."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict:  meh - kinda dry biscuit, potatoes were tasteless and strangely uniformely sized cubes Latte:  good  Nice space and service was good.  Maybe come back, maybe not."}
{"text":"So disappointed, brought out of town guest here on Friday around 4:30.  Had a seat on the patio, waited for about ten minutes for someone to come over and ask if these were our dishes.  Another ten for them to be cleared and the table was never wiped down there was food and sauce and dried beverages on the table  but never cleaned, asked about the happy hour wine \"it's not good but that's what you get for the price\".  Sangria was terrible.  I understand it is spring break here,however it's no surprise and a restaurant of this caliber should be stepping up their game not saying the wine is bad but that's what you get.  So disappointed and embarrassed that I brought out of town guest to this establishment."}
{"text":"The bacon wrapped dates are so yummy! The pumpkin cannelloni were delicious! Super rich and decadent -- one critique though is that there's so much filling and it's so thick that texturally, a bite was almost like the feeling when your mouth is full of peanut butter. The chicken scallopini had the most delicious sauce! My critique with that though was they take the time to get the panko crusted chicken breast so crunchy but the way it's plated on top of moist sautéed spinach and the sauce on top makes it all soggy and you loose most of the crunch. If it were played differently it could be better. Overall a great dinner experience though!"}
{"text":"I could seriously sit all day on their patio and enjoy the surroundings. Great location on the Scottsdale waterfront. Great large outdoor seating selection for big groups as well as smaller, nook-like areas for couples.. Sat outside with husband while his sister was in town. Plenty of misters. Only got the chance to try  cocktails and appetizers here, but everything was fantastic. Food came out quick and they were busy. Can't wait to go back for brunch!"}
{"text":"Loved the large industrial feel, open kitchen, seated in a nice tall-backed booth onlooking the kitchen and bar. (Patio closed due to rain) Tried 6 different food items from apps to entrees and everything was really good. Favorites being prosciutto/fig bruschetta and the veal tortelli. The peach whisky drink was delicious too. Really can't wait to try the rest of the menu... Busy for a Tuesday night so you know they're doing something right."}
{"text":"Nice place with the typical Sam Fox feel. Very relaxed feel to the restaurant. The portions are small and expensive. The flavors are great. Not a place to go if you are hungry or on a budget."}
{"text":"No complaints about Olive & Ivy!  Free underground parking.  It looked like they have items to purchase for takeout in addition to the restaurant and bar.  There was a bit of a wait to be seated for Sunday brunch, but they have pagers and we were able to wait at the bar.  Waiting is always better when there are cocktails involved!  When we were seated, we got bread made in house & served with amazing fresh pesto. You must try it.  (see pic:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wUKzaS1MHg94RGM6z8u9mw?select=_G2ZOQRe-pVGpNNKajnqCw)  White sangria was yummy, but didn't have any fresh fruit & was served in a low ball glass (see pic:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wUKzaS1MHg94RGM6z8u9mw?select=Zwif3G0eX8d5LHGae_HA9w). Bellini was very good and very strong!  I had a good buzz after 2 drinks.  Eggs Benedict was very good with fresh shaved ham & a little fresh basil in the hollandaise. I would've liked a bit more hollandaise (see pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wUKzaS1MHg94RGM6z8u9mw?select=RybLwKuSPLit5o2PPxy1aw).  My man's Breakfast sandwich was very good. The home fries were perfectly crispy in the outside & soft on the inside. (see pic:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wUKzaS1MHg94RGM6z8u9mw?select=YveKHBF94smnOuN-utOxOg)  Patio seating with waterfront view is quaint and has a European feeling with the umbrellas, stone fountains & geraniums in the tree planter boxes. All in all... A wonderful brunch experience. I would DEFINITELY come back the next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"After the event at Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams last night, a group of us decided to grab some dinner and drinks at Olive. Miraculously, there was one table left outside on the beautiful patio. We were greeted promptly by our waiter, Joey, and our drinks were on their way. Pesto and bread was brought over which went perfectly with my Chianti. Highly, highly recommend the pappardelle. Exquisite. Joey was very attentive and good, positive energy. Water and wine glasses were never left empty. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and will return soon!"}
{"text":"We thought it would be nice to sit outdoors on our Anniversary.   We made a reservation in advance to sit outdoors.   We were delayed due to traffic so  I called them to let them know that we would be less than five minutes late.   They gave our table away anyway.  We ended up seated inside so we left.   We ended up on Maggiano's patio where we had an outstanding and plentiful entree and dessert."}
{"text":"This place was great! Awesome atmosphere and great food. Service was spectacular and everyone was happy with their meal. The Mediterranean salad with shrimp was a good way to start the dinner and could be split. I had the natural chicken and it was moist and savory. The broth and mashed potatoes it was served with were to die for. We were out of town guests who considered going back a second night. Yum!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is so amazing.  The back patio looking over the greenbelt is so serene.  I had the salmon it was great.  Kids had the pizza as well as the yogurt parfait. Everyone was happy it is such a pleasant place."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and I have to say...seriously impressed!  We had to wait 15 minutes for a table but I'm glad the wait didn't deter us from eating here. We just took a short stroll along the water area and by the time we came back, our table was ready.   I LOVED the ambiance of this restaurant.  Very rustic decor, open kitchen, large dining and bar area and near the entrance; a section with bench seating with low coffee tables where patrons seemed to be enjoying cocktails and appetizers. I later discovered this was part of the bar. Very chic.  Even with high ceilings and openness of this restaurant, it was still very welcoming.  We were seated near the entrance to the outdoor patio so while we didn't sit outdoors, we felt like we were dining el fresco. This time of the year in Scottsdale is wonderful so we could not be any happier with where we were seated.   I ordered a Bloody Mary extra spicy and a margherita pizza (err flatbread) for lunch. The cocktail was made PERFECTLY and had a nice little kick to it...just how I like it.  The margherita pizza was absolutely delicious as well. The crust was thin, light and had great flavor and the toppings just made it that much more irresistible.  I didn't think I would be able to finish the entire pizza but I somehow did. I just could not stop myself, it was that tasty.  After complimenting our waitress (which I forgot her name (sorry!) on how great the service and food was, we discovered this is owned by the same company that manages True Food Kitchen, one of our favorite restaurants. We would come back here in a heartbeat....but since this is in Scottsdale and not in San Diego, it will be tough to get back here when we're craving you. So, can you please open an Olive & Ivy out here?"}
{"text":"This place has become our \"go to\" place after hiking Camelback every weekend for the past 4 (soon to be 5) weekends! The pastries are very good. This last time we had the egg, bacon, Avocado & cheese breakfast sandwich on a toasted roll - which was extremely tasty. The bread was really good - nice and soft - perfect for a sandwich with these ingredients. The staff is always friendly, patient and helpful."}
{"text":"I come here almost every day for lunch and I have been satisfied with the service and the food every time. If you are new to the restaurant, it have to try the chopped salad WITH GRILLED CHICKEN. I never thought I would say I crave a salad but this one is delicious."}
{"text":"I was disappointed that Cinnabon at Sky Harbor had closed, but Olive & Ivy has great cinnamon rolls. Mine was just the right size, gooey (after a brief warm-ip in their pizza oven), nicely iced, and cheap! $2.75 seems like a price from the last century. My big decaf was only $1.75.   What a great find!"}
{"text":"I don't understand all the five star reviews. We had an awful dinner. We ordered two appetizers, the hummus and 3 bruschetta (prosciutto, mushroom, and avocado.) All were lacking in flavor. The bread was sliced too thick, it was soft inside, and wasn't brushed with oil. Not true bruschetta, more like dip on top of a thick slice of French bread. The hummus was inedible. So much cumin that that is all you could taste. Totally overpowering. Were they trying to give it an Indian influence? My sister's beet salad was fine, but a salad you could find on any menu. My Caesar salad and my sister's flatbread were flavorless. The worst was the \"gelato.\" How they call that gelato is beyond me. Nowhere close to what gelato really tastes like. It was closer to ice milk.  I am not sure why this place is so popular. Perhaps because of the social scene or the ability to sit outside. If you are interested in good food, skip it."}
{"text":"I was searching for a place to have some birthday drinks before going out into old town. My friend wanted some wine, and we compromised on sangria. I have been wanting to try out this place based on the menu alone, but I was pleasantly surprised when I stepped in. There's a market side and then a restaurant side. The restaurant size itself is large and there's a great big patio too! The ambiance, although a little on the dimmer side, remained cute and cozy.   Our waitress was super nice and attentive. She offered some great suggestions. We ended up getting the cilantro jalapeno hummus to start (comes with cucumbers, celery, AND carrot sticks) to snack on while we drank our white sangria that we ordered by the pitcher. We ended it with a lemon pudding cake (complimentary). It's good if you like lemon! The top was fluffy and the bottom was a little soggier...but not in a bad way? Soggy is the wrong word probably but I can't think of another way to describe it!! Haha. It comes with a burnt honey ice cream and blackberries. Yum! :)  It was a great spot."}
{"text":"Amazing! Our server was wonderful, knowledgable, and fun! The food was amazing. There were so many more items that I cannot wait to try. I had the surf and turf. The steak was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Followed the Yelp reviews to this destination. Ate on the Market side and the food and portions were perfect. My only regret is that we didn't find this place sooner! Would love to come back for lunch."}
{"text":"We came in on a busy Friday night and lucked out with two seats at the bar.   We ordered the white sangria and bacon wrapped dates as happy hour was about to end. The dates were SO good. White sangria was kind of odd... But not bad.  We split a Caesar salad and the bone in rib eye. They were very accommodating about splitting the food and everything was split prior to us receiving it.   The rib eye was cooked a smidge under medium but it was so good, it didn't even matter. The potatoes were very crunchy and yummy too!  Our bartender was a very friendly man as well, and he made the experience even better!  My boyfriend is not much of a foodie, but he absolutely loved this place. So that's saying a lot!"}
{"text":"As a general rule I try to avoid Olive & Ivy on weekend nights, not that the ambiance isn't great or there is a food or service problem it's just BUSY! If you don't have reservations popping in for a cocktail during peak times in the bar can be challenging, on the one hand you get to get a good look at \"The Real Housewives\" of Scottsdale in their natural habitat and many variations there of.  So I went with two friends and I was so happy we got a small comfortable cocktail table next to the bar which can be like hitting the lottery on a busy night. Service is always good I feel even on a busy night my water was always replaced. Cocktails always good they can take a while but you will understand looking at the packed bar so you have to give them a break. In previous visits I usually get the Chefs seasonal board, Italian meats and fresh cheeses and roasted vegetables this visit we got the Hummus it was fine I mean Hummus is hummus. Two flat breads the braised short rib with Gorgonzola and arugula, I'm the only human I think that does not like short rib, I've had it before in other establishments but it's not my go to. My choice was the pesto chicken with pine nuts and I asked if we could leave the caramelized onions off half of it since I was in a picky mood and do not like onions, they were so nice about it and despite the busy kitchen it came out perfect. Service + food + ambiance +"}
{"text":"While the food was good, it was really the service that was outstanding!!! Our server Michael deserves 5 stars. Michael was so accommodating throughout, always arriving to our table with a smile and some jokes. He really took time with us, answering questions when deciding what to order. And just overall, Michael had such a pleasant demeanor. Thank you, Michael! I ordered the Hash, I believe, which is 2 easy-over eggs atop potatoes and sautéed green peppers, topped with a gravy. Also had the delicious home-made cinnamon roll! The end."}
{"text":"A nice classy place in Scottsdale. Good for a romantic outing.  Service is good and the food is upscale - so is the pricing.  We had appetizers there along with drinks. Food was great but mixed drinks left a lot to be desired.  Rightfully so, they have a very limited cocktail menu. More focus on wine and other liquor - hence the upscale menu. Great location and ambiance"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! I love coming here before shopping at fashion square. I always get the kale salad, it is basically the best salad ever. The bread and pesto is so good I could honestly just go for a glass of wine and bread and be happy. The sea bass though, how did you guys come up with it?!? Sooooo amazing! Mine was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was so good I almost licked the plate (okay, I did lick the plate) when it's nice outside I like to sit outside, any other time, the bar is the place to be."}
{"text":"Out of towners - call ahead even on weekdays! We showed up tonight (monday) and the only space for us was at the chef's table, overlooking the kitchen. That was actually very pleasant to watch the food prep, but it was surprising that all the tables were booked for the next 1.5 hours when the space is large and the patio is huge! Also, it meant having to sit on high stools with very difficult to reach hooks underneath the counter for our purses.  Decor is gorgeous - high ceilings, Edison lightbulbs hanging from the ceiling, candles, huge glass walls looking onto the patio & canal... Very romantic and chill.  Our server was very friendly and pleasant. We had asparagus bruschetta, bacon wrapped dates, the sweet potato cannelloni, and tried both sangrias. All tasty. Had toasted coconut and white chocolate raspberry gelato for dessert. Food was good quality, focaccia & pesto were great for setting the Mediterranean/California vibe.  The general manager even came to check on us and we enjoyed chatting with her. Lots of friendly people in a beautiful relaxing place with tasty food. Exactly what we were looking for (minus the high stools) on our vacation!"}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant in Scottsdale! My friend was visiting from LA and we decided to come here which was the perfect choice. We sat outside across the water on the cute couch/chairs.   We were there for happy hour and most things on their menu were 1/2 off. We started with three types of bruschetta: butternut squash w/goat cheese, prosciutto w/fig and mozzarella w/tomato jam. The bread was super fluffy and the  flavors were very good. I also ordered a glass of white wine which paired well  with my appetizers.   For my main dish I ordered the chicken pesto flatbread which was really good. The pesto was just right and I even had enough to take 1/2 of it to go. Overall, great restaurant and atmosphere. I will definitely be returning to try some of their dinner dishes!"}
{"text":"Great service. We went for a belated birthday and they treated us very nicely and with a lot of attention. This place is easy to find and pretty central. We got the 33oz bone in ribeye, mac and cheese, and also brussels sprouts. We ordered it medium rare and it came out pretty rare in general (which was fine with us). The ambiance is nice and since it's a large open kitchen with patio and bar space...you have a lot of options in terms of seating."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon.  Ordered the breakfast burrito and a side of fruit.  We sat out on the patio.  It was a beautiful day and the farmer's market was going on so there were a lot of people walking around.  The food and service at Olive & Ivy was great.  My breakfast burrito (with egg whites) was delicious.  I also liked the potatoes that it came with and the fruit that I ordered was very fresh.  The service was on point too.  Overall a good experience and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Wonderful patio with a great view, misters and plentiful shade for the summer. Interesting cocktails and a nice variety of wine both by the glass or bottle.  Diverse menu with everything from lighter fare to hearty steaks and seafood."}
{"text":"It was a lunch on a random Wednesday, but the restaurant seemed vast and a little empty when we arrived.  We did see two of their private rooms which seemed to be a great choice for group dining.  I thought the food was average, our waiter was cute and friendly but a little slow for lunch, and the prices a little high.  I may need to revisit but there are so many places to go.  Luckily, my lunch friend makes all places fun!"}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant 4-5 times now with my family, girlfriends and other groups. Every time, we had a great time. Great atmosphere, delicious food, I have tried many items from their menu and all were delicious. See information below: Bruschetta appetizers- Asparagus, Prosciutto, Manchego- all were delicious Bacon Wrapped Dates- little too sweet for my taste, but for a person who loves sweets, this would be perfect Margherita flatbread- it was okay, nothing to brag about Wild Mushroom Pappardelle Pasta- for all mushroom lovers, it had beautiful earthy flavor, loved every bite of it, and leftovers are delicious too!! Sea Scallops*- a light dinner dish, scallops were perfectly done, not overcooked.  Chicken Scallopini- this was amazing, not too strong on the spices but chicken was nice and tender Natural Chicken- another beautiful chicken dish, perfectly done.  Flavors of all dishes are great and different. Their customer service is always amazing and they are very attentive to your needs. Their cocktails are more on the sweeter side so i preferred to stick with either beer or wine and they have great selection as well.  The atmosphere inside the restaurant can be little too loud if you are planning to talk a lot more with your girlfriend, their outdoor seating area would be a better choice and with the perfect weather and temperature, it is pretty nice.  Taking one star away, as they are little pricey with their menu but the quantity of main dishes is more on the smaller side.But that is definitely not going to stop me from going there again or recommending this wonderful restaurant to my friends and family members."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner at this restaurant, fair prices, great flatbreads, beautiful restaurant.   Food tasted very fresh and and \"waterfront\" locale was refreshing after a few hot days in Phoneix. Very nice outdoor bar area as well.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  Management reached out to us to \"correct\" and \"investigate\" the poor service we received our first time in.  We decided to give Olive & Ivy another chance and tried out their Brunch today without telling them.  The hostess station greeted us and arranged to seat us without any delay.  Good so far.   Tony, our waiter, arrived thereafter and introduced himself asking if we had been here before, sharing the soup of the day and answering our menu questions.  Again, good so far, but it only got better.  Tony took our orders and returned with fresh bread and pesto sauce on the side.  We ordered.  My Eggs Benedict were not only superb but the Coffee Mocha was excellent!!  My wife enjoyed her eggs, bacon, and potatoes as well.  Tony continued to check on us.  Here's what I learned as I looked around.  The service and food should not only be \"good\", but it looked as if \"excellent\" was the expectation, the bar.  People were happy, the different food looked great - and the wait staff was very attentive.  We have become fans.  Thank you to Tony and the management."}
{"text":"Very Hipster with prices to match.Tried scallops for the first time- they were okay.  Tried 4 of the appetizers, bacon wrapped dates were decent, felt they could have been warmer.  There were a caucophany of flavors that were trying just a little too hard.  I did try the chicken scallopini, which is probably what I would order if i came back."}
{"text":"Breakfast / Brunch here is one of the best! Lovely to sit outside and enjoy the AZ weather with tableside mimosas. The coffee is my favorite in town, love the granola in the parfait, the breakfast sandwiches and potatoes are delicious and the kids love all of the fresh baked treats. Bring the family, the dogs, great to walk around the waterfront too.   Come ready to relax or after a run/walk down the canal. Just love this place!"}
{"text":"I've been to Olive and Ivy a few times now and I've enjoyed the food, service and ambiance each time. I'm a big fan of the beef filet. This place has a great patio and the inside decor is modern and fun."}
{"text":"On the positive side, the food was imaginative, well executed and presented. However on the other side of the coin, the waitstaff is poorly trained and aggressive in telling you what you want, even after you order it your way. For example, my medium rare tuna arrived medium well because I wouldn't order it rare. There appeared to be little service training: when ordering wines by the glass, the waiter said that is what we call it even if it is wrong, when he missed one of the ladies in our party during the drink order, there was no apology just a flip comment from the waiter that clearly offended her. The staff clearly has the priority and walked thru parties while they were being seated rather than taking the 2 extra steps to walk around. It is a shame, since this a nice place with good food at a reasonable price and everyone in our party enjoyed their food but the waiter ruined it for some of us and there are so many good alternatives close by."}
{"text":"Trendy and located right on the Scottsdale \"waterfront\", its a typical fox-con restaurant.  Our service was great. We were seated promptly at our reservation time. Our waiter was helpful with menu recommendations and a little too attentive to our drink.  we had a starter consisting of a pile of fried food.  All of it was pretty good, but nothing special.  I had a chicken dish. If was fried but the breading was a little soggy. My lady-friends sea bass suffered the same problems as the skins were not crispy in the slightest.  Overall, this is probably more of a place to be seen than a place to actually enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Get the sweet potato cannelloni! Its delicious. If you are having brunch try the yogurt with granola and fruit."}
{"text":"Love this place, as long as you make an advanced rez. Awesome patio. Ambiance is perfect. DJ was on point   The homemade pesto was delicious and the kale salad so, so good! Will definitely dine here again in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE!  Went here on a suggestion by a local socialite and boy were we oh so pleased! This place is soo cute at night on the inside with all the hanging lights rustic feel and the deejay, which played amazing music. We sat outside under the cute trees with strung lights. I was so in love with the look of this place. You can come with friends or on a date and it works! And service was excellent!  The food was very creative and if I was local I would be here every week to try all the food and hang out on patio with a glass of wine! Wish I had this place in Miami...it would be a success here! We had the watermelon avocado goat cheese salad, fungi flat bread, bacon wrapped dates, arugula artichoke salad, shrimp with corn risotto, and the scallops...all hands down incredible! Love the menu!   My only question is this place is in water front...where the hell is the water anyway??"}
{"text":"So... I fully intended to take photos of my food here, but I blame hunger, sun, great conversation, and delicious food for preventing me from following through! The patio is so amazing - right next to the canal, and covered in greenery, cute tables and chairs, and good shade coverage for that spicy Arizona sun! Our server was super sweet, friendly, and had some great humour - respecting the fact that we were deep in conversation, but still getting our order in reasonable time, and connecting with us on a human level too. The restaurant was quite busy, but I felt that he was still very attentive, and did a great job.  We ordered bread and pesto, and the hummus plate with veggies to start. Holy moly, guys. Holy. Moly. I got really into making pesto this summer, with bunches of fresh Italian basil being so cheap, and this was just as good, if not better than homemade (always a huge compliment!!) I also love making my own hummus and this was at least 5 times better than mine! We got a huge heap of hummus with yummy, warm pita, a great variety of veggies - cucumber, celery, snap peas etc. - all covered with semi-pickled cucumber, red onion, and feta. YUM!! You guys... go get some, stat!   For my main I got the Mediterranean Chicken Salad (as did EVERYONE else at the table, which says a lot!) and it was really good. If you pushed me I'd have had two more plates of hummus rather than the salad, but I would almost sell my first born for more of that hummus... almost. The salad was fresh, and I liked the mix of ingredients - they felt well balanced, and well dressed, but the chicken was a bit dry.   I had a great time at Olive & Ivy - it's a great place for a relatively healthy working lunch, and I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food was good. Nice atmosphere. Our server seemed to be overwhelmed with tables when I went with a friend for lunch. I would go back as the food was good. Not exceptional but good and worth going back too."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and great service. If you are looking for food in terminal A get to Olive & Ivy. Breakfast sandwich with avacado, egg, bacon and cheese is awesome. I had no cheese though. People are really friendly here too."}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere and friendly staff made this a great choice. Bruschetta was a hit as were the bacon wrapped dates. Will definitely be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Cranberry margarita is delicious. Butternut squash tortelli is fabulous! Ambiance is nice, comfortable and lively, but a touch loud. Portions are perfectly sized. Very satisfying!"}
{"text":"Loved Olive & Ivy. Went here for brunch with the grandparents & kids and it was a cute setting right on the waterfront canal in Old Town Scottsdale. Food was top notch classy... also, DESSERT...my daughter had a peanut butter chocolate brownie that we passed around the table to share and it was by far the most complimented."}
{"text":"I went on a Friday night to grab a late night meal. The place is beautiful and the atmosphere is lounge-like. I saw a few families there and I thought that was a little weird since it was pretty late. So far...it's ok. Then we get to the bad part: our waiter. I don't remember his name nor will I put him on blast here. He was horrible! First he took forever to greet us. He was very apologetic for not being attentive. Then he takes our drink order and runs around cover his section. We get our drinks maybe 20 minutes later. He apologizes again. Then he grabs our menus and walks away. That's the thing...he was always around but was so fast we couldn't ask for anything. We tried for about 10 minutes to get anyone's attention so we could order. He come back and asked if we ordered. Really?!? You took our menus... So now we get to the insulting part. I asked him if the scallops were enough to split if we order an appetizer and salad. Simple question, right? Here's his answer: oh honey, don't you know...the better the restaurant the smaller the portion. Really?!? A simple yes or no could have been sufficient. Oh and he food....it wasn't great. It was just very ok. We ordered the bacon wrapped dates. Those were pretty good. Then we had he kale salad. It was so bitter I couldn't eat it. The scallop were good. Not bad but not excellent either. I would recommend this place for drinks and small bites in the patio area but this isn't a place I would come to for great food."}
{"text":"We had an amazing breakfast here. Staff is friendly. No wait time and the food came out pretty quick. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Updating my review because I decided to give this place another chance, based on all the positive reviews and because I was starving. This time I thoroughly enjoyed by slice of Mediterranean pizza and glass of Chardonnay, and the service was friendly and courteous. For airport food, definitely 4 stars."}
{"text":"We came to Olive & Ivy for dinner on last Saturday while we were on vacation in paradise valley. It had a good atmosphere and service was great. I ordered the Natural Chicken and my husband ordered the Ribeye and both were delicious."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Scottsdale!  Amazing ambience!  Superb service!  The food was delish! Breathtaking decor with huge airwalls that are open to a beautiful patio.  The pesto with bread is ridiculous good!  They also have a cute little cafe side with smoothies and breakfast stuff!"}
{"text":"LOVE this restaurant! Gorgeous ambiance and decor, great music, wonderful service, and delicious food! Just celebrated my end of post doc party there last night and had the best party of my life there thanks to the amazing staff!   We had folks with gluten, meat, and egg allergies and the staff took great care to prepare our order to specification even offering to substitute items on the menu. Especially loved the fresh mozzarella bruschetta and Mediterranean salad. Reasonable prices on these items.   They have a range of seating options including beautifully decorated outdoor patio with misters, fire pit, and plush seats for a chill atmosphere, indoor booths and tables (had a live DJ there too last night) with soft lighting indoors, and a gorgeous private room for events that (can seat up to 12) for a high class flair.   Usually the require a minimum charge to use their private room but yesterday out of kindness they offered me the room and waived this since the room was available and they didn't want it to go to waste. Made for a perfect evening with my friends and family. They turned the music down for us in the room so we could mingle and make our champagne toast and even let us bring in our own cake and provided us plates and silverware. Perfect amount of checking on us. Attentive waiter while giving us enough privacy.   Only feedback is to expand options for vegans and vegetarians at least by having more items available for entree substitutions. Other than that, perfect place for any occasion!! :-)"}
{"text":"We have been new residents of Old Town Scottsdale almost a year, and we have had several visitors since coming to this lively and lovely community. We have taken ALL of them to Olive & Ivy.   Their food is first rate, the mood can be restful and peaceful on their beautiful shaded patio overlooking the water, and it can be energizing and electric inside.   Of our several dining outings there so far, all have been highly satisfying."}
{"text":"We love this place, and we wish there was a location in Chandler where we live.  Make sure you check Costco for Fox Concepts Restaurant gift cards before you go.  You can get $100 gift card for $80! My wife and I love the flat bread pizzas here, and their homemade gelato is outstanding! I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour! We sat at the bar and enjoyed sangria along with a very satisfying assortment of bruschettas and an order of bacon-wrapped dates.   Only downside was that happy hour is not available in all parts of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Nick is an awesome bartender! He's so much fun and knows what I want before I know what I want! I highly recommend the Mediterranean Salad ( Nicks suggestion!) I got it with salmon! I will definitely be one of his regulars! Also, the pesto is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Love their food and funky outdoor patio. I crave their red sangria and I highly recommend the bacon wrapped dates. Sounds strange but everyone who I've had try them is always pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch with a friend while I was visiting from Cali, and I had a wonderful experience. Service is excellent and the food was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner with some girlfriends. This restaurant is in a great location in old town scottsdale. Food was ok and the atmosphere was pretty good. Huge place with modern decor. Their patio area overlook the canal."}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy is a perfect Italian & Mediterranean style restaurant. They have a mix of pasta dishes, flatbread options as well as seafood dishes.   For an appetizer, we ordered the vine ripe tomato bruschetta. It's really only good for 1 serving, so I suggest if you're sharing order 3 for $11.  We also ordered the fritto misto which is a mix of fried zucchini, rock shrimp and calamari.  I felt it was a little salty for my taste but still a good appetizer.   My friend was craving beets, so she ordered the beet salad. For some reason, I thought beets were dark reddish colored but these beets were yellow/orangeish.   My main dish was the chicken scallopini which consisted for 2 large chicken breasts with prosciutto and mozzarella in the middle. You can definitely share this dish because it was big.  My friend ordered the sweet potato cannelloni which basically to me was like a stuffed ravioli. I love sweet potatoes so this dish was really yummy. I will order this one next time.   The restaurant has a bar (the white sangria was yummy) and the space is very open/large.  Price wise: Entrees range from $15 to $30 depending on what you order. I think fish options and seafood dishes were pretty expensive for me personally.   Overall, great dining experience."}
{"text":"Wonderful place! Great atmosphere and decor. Adorable outside seating. Fabulous private room! We went here for brunch for a bachelorette party and had amazing service. All the food was delicious and of great, fresh, quality. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My husband took me to Olive & Ivy for my birthday last year and it was perfect! Their pesto is made in house and has the best flavor! I could go for a jar of that right now actually... My husband ordered the scallops, which I believe were a seasonal special, and they were the best scallops we've ever had. We also ordered a charcuterie style appetizer which was delicious. Wine was flowing and service was great! Can't wait to stop back here! (also - this is the cutest restaurant - definitely try to sit on the patio)"}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy is great! We were recently in Scottsdale, AZ for my sister's bachelorette. We decided to hit up Olive & Ivy for dinner during one of the nights that we were in town. Interestingly enough, our group was one of four bachelorette parties there that night! We were originally seated at a table, but, after talking with our waiter, we were able to move our five person group to a much more roomy, comfortable booth. The restaurant has great ambience - it felt very cozy and had a fun atmosphere. We tried the following: various bruschetta, the kale salad, and a bunch of different entrees. Everything was delicious! Somehow we were able to save enough room for dessert - we all tried the gelato!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and a good place to pass the time while waiting for a flight. Unfortunately, the breakfast isn't very good. I ordered the traditional breakfast with scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon and English muffin. Portions were generous. I watched the woman who took my order put it together, and items were premade and were lukewarm. The bacon was a huge pile of extremely soggy and sad precooked bacon from a pot. Eggs were old and hard. I had asked for cheese with the eggs, and even though it's on the menu the women didn't understand me and offered me a tub a cream cheese instead. The English muffin was from a pile under the toaster and wasn't toasted. The potatoes were the frozen seasoned kind and were probably the best thing on the plate. Since most of this ended up being inedible I went back for a cinnamon roll that was dry and burnt on the bottom. I would recommend eating elsewhere for breakfast."}
{"text":"Every time I dine at Olive & Ivy, the service never fails to exceed expectations. Starting from the lovely ladies at the host stand to my favorite spot on the patio lounge couches.  I personally love brunch. They always offer a wide variety of delicious pastries and tasty cocktails. My server recommended the Peach Bellini, which was a wonderful addition with my chocolate croissant. Great hospitality and yummy food, definitely recommend bringing friends and family!"}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy is a great place for a tasty meal. The staff was wonderful. Our waiter had recommended the grapefruit mojito. Most of their sangrias are puree based so don't expect any fruit pulp.  I had the homestyle cheddar biscuit off of their breakfast menu. It was very yummy. Scrambled eggs on top of a cheddar biscuit on the bottom.  The Iced Chai Tea Latte was prime. The only thing that took me by surprise was how heavy the whip cream was on the top of the latte.   Overall, two thumbs up."}
{"text":"came here for something already made since i had a transfer and just came from a long flight. they had pizza ready to go. female cashier charged me and gave 2 other people their orders and walked off to do seemingly nothing at all. there was no one around and when she finally came back, my pizza was cold and i couldn't wait any longer since my flight was already boarding. they need to train their employees better and be aware that people have flights to catch."}
{"text":"It is always good here. A wonderful spot on the canal in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is a gorgeous (albeit large) restaurant with many favorites on the menu. I have dined here twice and both times the food and service were just average. Left me wanting."}
{"text":"I was looking through Yelp and read the reviews and thought why not try something different. A couple days ago a friend and I decided to try it out for brunch and it was a beautiful place to just sit and have a conversation with great food. Our server ( I wish I remembered his name ) brought us a pesto and bread for an appetizer it was amazing but be careful you can easily get full from the bread. I order the sweet potato cannelloni - OH MY LANTA! It was so good! I love sweet potato AND I have a big sweet tooth so this was right up my alley. It had 5-6 sweet potato stuffed pasta with spinach, mushroom and toasted almonds to top off. I Highly recommend this if you like sweet food! And also my friend got the kale salad which consist of bacon, blue cheese, apples and candied pecans - I had a chance to try it and that was definitely delicious as well! Overall do yourself a favor and try it out! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The service was great and the ambiance is awesome. Would try again for that alone.  But the pesto that comes with the focaccia was salty, and the trio of bruschettas we chose (asparagus, vine ripe tomato, funghi) were all unbearably sweet. Cheese tortelli has a twinge of sugar as well. I dont understand why everything was sweet :/ I dont like my savory food to be sweet too, so I was a little disappointed.  The strawberry cheesecake gelato on the other hand, which I WANTED to be sweet, was to die for. yum."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night and enjoyed my experience.  I thought it was pretty busy for a Thursday night, but the service was excellent and my waiter took the time to explain the menu in detail to me.  Good selection of menu options and I ended-up ordering the Chicken Scallopini, which was excellent.  It was cooked perfectly and was served with mushrooms and over a bed of spinach with a Madeira sauce.  Didn't have any room for dessert, but will have to go back when I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Very good!  Did find a small piece of chicken and beacon in my vegan salad (cross contamination, accident)."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here yesterday. The service was fantastic (our server's name was Landis) and the food was great will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, fantastic food, great drinks! Just a great place to people watch and listen to a great DJ. I went on a Saturday night with my boyfriend without a reservation and we were seated in 20 minutes. I love the decor...very polished."}
{"text":"I like Olive & Ivy's food, but I love their Mojitos. I could completely forgo the food and solely sip on that delicious drink. However, my gripe is that I don't really think it's worth $10. That is a little steep for that particular drink in my opinion, as they don't make it too strong and it's not muddled to perfection a la Trader Vic's style.  Their food is good to really good, and I do think that most of the menu is over priced. That's probably because you are paying for the \"concept\" not the food. As per usual, Olive & Ivy attracts a fake crowd - just like most of the Sam Fox spots. On the other side though, this restaurant does provide me with some excellent people watching and that's always fun every once in a while.   Some other good aspects of Olive & Ivy are the: outdoor patio (great place to sip my Mojito and people watch), sea bass or seared ahi tuna dishes (I'll usual order one or the other) and the service (their wait staff is on top of their tables).  Olive & Ivy doesn't get me too excited so it's a solid 3 stars... because if someone asked me to suggest a restaurant in the Waterfront area, it probably wouldn't be my first recommendation."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and food!  Great service and relaxing environment to go on the weekend.  I would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I loved, loved the food here.  We went there for brunch and i had a croissant and the Braised Short Rib. Both were so ,so , so good!!  The service was great , the bread and pesto delish.   We decided to stay outside and The only thing i did not like was all the bird poop falling on our table/ on our clothes and on our plates. Those trees outside are beautiful so maybe just install something to catch all  poop drops. :D."}
{"text":"This location is soooo hard to find. My stupid google map took me somewhere else. I called the restaurant and the host was very thorough and stayed on the phone with me and directed me til I see the restaurant. The ambience is really nice. Food was good. Service is great."}
{"text":"The chicken salad pressed panini, was delicious! Enough for 2 people to share while waiting for your flight to board. They have 2 big screen TVs with sports on and plenty of seating space. A long bar in the middle for large groups and booths. The booths have power outlets in the bottom for you to charge your electronics while you dine. Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here recently for a romantic date night dinner. The service was impeccable, and the food was superb. Try the toasted bruchettas (roasted brussel sprouts and butternut squash); you won't be disappointed. The lamb meatballs were good, but not great. My natural chicken dish was quite good and quite filling. The atmosphere is fun, friendly, and I would recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I recently visited Olive and Ivy for business last week, and after 3 visits, I am convinced that Fox Restaurants has some of the best establishments in the valley.  Olive and Ivy is the Fox Restaurant of choice for consistently good food, great drinks, and most of all, outstanding service.  I spend a lot of time in various restaurants across the valley and am always amazed at how bad service can be at some of the more popular valley restaurants.  Not Olive and Ivy.  From the first phone call for reservations, to the greeting upon walking in the door to the smiles and warm reception you receive from every server you cross, this restaurant knows how to make you feel special.  Many of the reviews here will focus on the food and I could spend hours talking about my experiences but I will sum it up in a couple of my favorites.   I hate dates and prunes, but the bacon wrapped dates are crazy good! The shrimp and risotto main course is one of the best dishes I have tasted since arriving in Phoenix 3 years ago.  And hands down, their short rib entree is best in the valley.  The only catch is the cost.  Olive and Ivy is not cheap and definitely not for brothers looking to execute the cheap date.  With wine, apps, and main course, you will easy break the century mark, and if you are really being generous, $200 is obtainable.  But, it's worth every dollar and who knows, you may even get breakfast out of the deal!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for happy hour- the bartender was super attentive. Sangria was delicious and food was great!!!"}
{"text":"We always try to find a new place to eat when we come here, especially for breakfast - most important meal!!  We walked in and this place is a place after my own heart. My partner and I shared The Classic Egg Sandwich; avocado, bacon, white American cheese, mayo, all on a toasted brioche bun, with some breakfast potatoes on the side.  So. Damn. Good.   I'm not sure I would be able to eat it all on my own, but I'd sure try!!  Next time I come I want to try the Caramelized Brussels Sprouts Flatbread (glazed sweet potato, chèvre, smoked pistachios) *drool*"}
{"text":"We ordered caramelized Brussels sprouts flatbread  And Bacon wrapped dates and they both were amazing!! I had the sweet potato cannelloni and it was to die for!!! So many amazing flavors!! This restaurant is a must!!! Loved everything!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I loved this restaurant. Everything from the food, drinks, service, and decor were great. Next time we are in town we will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Super service by Josh and delicious food! The outdoor patio space is huge and comfortable; feels like home but without having the clean up after party. Spot on for champagne and light bites."}
{"text":"Excellent.  My only complaint is that they never seem to have the bacon wrapped dates.  I have been dying to try these, and I've been through PHX 3 times this year, but have not been able to get them once.  Apparently they don't have them for lunch, and they sell out really quickly for dinner.  For the food I actually got, the bacon wrapped pork loin was heavenly.  It sits on a bed of squash that absorb the bacon/pork flavor.  I almost licked the plate.  The watermelon salad was also good.  The dressing is sweet, but has a slight kick of savory pepper.  I had it for lunch once, but I think I might order for desert next time I go.  Speaking of desert, the huckleberry cheesecake was momentous.  It's served in mini-mason jars, which some of my colleges got a kick out of.  The service has been outstanding every time I've been there.  Both waiters I've had demonstrated extensive knowledge of the wine list and menu and made great recommendations.  The scenery isn't too bad either."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a few years, but I have had a few great experiences at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Place is very good.  Good wine list, good unique food.  Not gigantic portions, which I view as a good thing..."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Olive & Ivy. Our server was very attentive and friendly, and the food came out quickly and was superb. I want to try to recreate their beet salad at home, but doubt it will taste as good! I did have a small problem with my meal, but after telling the server, we got a visit from the manager (who was very nice) and he apologized and bought us two desserts. It totally made up for any problem - the desserts (lemon cake with blueberry compote and peanut butter pudding) were too good - had trouble eating just a little!"}
{"text":"Love the patio! You feel like you are in the middle of a patio in the Mediteranean! Started with happy hour bruchetta's. We got three different ones and they were only $3 each on happy hour. My favorite was the funghi but the fig and procutto and the corizo was really good as well. I got a flat bread that was again mushroom and cheese and arugala. It was good, but a little burnt. And not just \"crispy.\" Actual black burnt edges which the server should have probably noticed and not brought out. I left all the crust but the rest was very flavorful. The server was very nice, didn't rush us and we sat in between appetizers and meals for a little while.   You should call ahead for a table in the evening, we had very limited choices since we didn't but it was nice and relaxing on the patio but not as comforable for a meal, better for drinks and apps. Great location, good food, and good service but it is the atmosphere that I really loved about this place!"}
{"text":"This location is the worst. Even if they did provide decent food I would not spend any money here again due to the customer service alone. An employee here when I ordered an americano was extremely rude, condescending and demanding. What ever happened to a simple smile and hey how are you?"}
{"text":"Great spot in Scottsdale! We couldn't get a table so we opted for seats at the bar. Entire staff was awesome and very knowledgable. We had fig and dates, flatbread and shared a salad. Great upbeat vibe! Check it out!  Would def suggest making a reservation!!"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot in Downtown Scottsdale with a helpful staff and a wonderful patio."}
{"text":"We only came for breakfast because we were leaving to come back to Chicago, but I definitely want to try their dinner! After eating at Modern Steak and Sauce, we decided to come here and grab a bite. Fox group is three for three in our book! I had their egg sandwich with avocado, bacon and cheese and that was amazing! Those potatoes that it came with were so yummy too! It was deceiving, I wasn't sure if it was going to keep me full, but I was stuffed after eating it! Their muffins were yummy and my dog loved the treats I brought him home :) The outdoor patio was so beautiful and the dining room looked amazing. We will definitely try dinner when we come back to Arizona!"}
{"text":"I returned to Olive and Ivy after a couple of years. We sat on the patio even though it was 100+ degrees out. We had Maria as our server she is amazing she made sure we had water, came back to check on us, she is friendly and made our experience so much better."}
{"text":"Need reservations for dinner inside....but if you walk in there's a common fire pit area to chill in ...you just shove in and enjoy...great menu...sweet server Miranda...nice ambiance...relaxed by the firepit...nice salad, pizza n sangria. Enjoy...good music...we'd come back...thx"}
{"text":"Nice seating options,  I like the outdoor patio seating. The beard and pesto is super delicious.  I tried the lamb gyro and was nice and they are really generous unless you're really hungry, you might not be able to finish it all. My friend had the atlantic salmon which he liked. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Peach Bellini nummy nummy nummy. Love the bread with pesto  and my gyros were delicious."}
{"text":"I'm going to update my review for Olive and Ivy up to 4 stars. I've come back here with new friends to introduce them to the deliciousness and each has absolutely loved it!  Menu items that remain my favorite for brunch include the Turkey Grinder and Chicken Panini. For dinner I really like the Fungi Trifoliati flatbread, Mediterranean Salad (with either salmon well done or chicken), Sweet Potato Cannelloni, and Natural Chicken. The flatbread and salad are available on their lunch menu as well!  As I've mentioned in my previous reviews, the pesto and bread they serve is absolutely phenomenal. The patio area is great for a group get togethers. We've been out there a few times just to enjoy cocktails and appetizers. The main dining room also provides a great ambiance for a group dinner or intimate date night. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here on several occasions and I'm always impressed by how attentive the staff is. As busy as they are on the weekends, the staff always made sure that our drinks were being filled while we waited for our food. During my most recent visit, it got really windy outside (we sat out on the patio this particular night), and the staff was nice enough to move 2-3 of the space heaters near to our table so that my guests and I can be warm. In addition, the food is spectacular. Very flavorful and piping hot upon serving. I highly recommend the shrimp risotto and the sea scallops."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a nice lunch and nothing tops the food, sangria and atmosphere sitting under the trees enjoying the canal. We had three different types of bruchetta a Rueben sandwich and ended with honey gelato. The food was excellent I can't begin to describe the flavor combinations on the bruchetta it was perfection. I am a sangria snob and to date this is hands down the best sangria I have ever had! the waitress was attentive without hovering over us the whole time. We will be going back but this time it will be at night. They have beautiful lighting out on the patio that is so romantic but reservations are a must at night! Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"A very cool and neat atmosphere. They have outdoor and indoor seating. I had a salad and it was huge and filled me up! The staff is wonderful as well"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Olive & Ivy back in April and the food and service were excellent! I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. For appetizers we got the bruschetta-prosciutto and the mozzarella. We also got the margarita flatbread. These three appetizers were phenomenal. As for my dinner, I got the lasagna bolognese and it was very tasty!  As for the service, our waiter was very knowledgeable, professional and sociable."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.  5 stars?  Maybe out of 10...  Brunch was below average, offering a handful of mediocre breakfast-y things.  There was no yummy French toast, pancakes or even an omelette!  I ordered the eggs benny which was served dry boasting a teaspoon of hollandaise and was extremely underwhelming.    For lack of choice, my mom ordered a tuna salad sandwich for $14.  Really?  What respectable chef even puts a tuna sandwich on a brunch menu! ?  It was my birthday this information was in the reservation comments AND I INFORMED THE HOSTESS.  Not only did my server not acknowledge the day with a complimentary ANYTHING I wasn't even told \"Happy Birthday\"...  While I'm new to AZ, I know in my foodie heart that there's got to be a better place to dine as this couldn't possibly be \"as good as it gets\"."}
{"text":"Wow best customer service I've ever received in Scottsdale. Now my favorite place. Thank you. Absolutely love the staff and the decor."}
{"text":"Chris was absolutely amazing. He was very attentive, had a great memory, and even brought an umbrella outside to shade me when he saw me covering my head. I love the service here. The bread and pesto is one of the next appetizers in old town! Ps. Grab a cinnamon roll when you can"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and the food is great!  It's location is perfect.  Set nicely in old town right next to the mall.  The service was fast but they didn't make you feel in a rush to eat.  Most importantly, my drink was never empty!  You know that's the worst when you have to flag down a waiter. Not here!  I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Sooooo good. Beautiful place with lovely outdoor seating on the canal. Close to everything. Great service. Fast service too. Food is awesome. I had a great salad. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Scallops were under cooked. Service more interested in drinks. 3 beets in the salad. Not acceptable. Wine was good. More interested in bar service."}
{"text":"Decent food and good service for the happy hour on the patio. Lamb meatballs were the best"}
{"text":"This place is a must if in old town Scottsdale. The chill atmosphere on the patio if hard to beat."}
{"text":"Had a great experience and the food was good. My wife enjoyed the sangria especially the white sangria."}
{"text":"I've known Sam Fox (Fox Restaurant Concepts) since his days running City Grill and Gilligan's back in Tucson so I was pleased many years ago when he decided to expand to the Valley.  I believe that Olive and Ivy was one of the first restaurants he opened outside of Tucson and at the time it was no sure thing that he would make it. That's why I am happy that it is so good and that he has done so well.  The food is delicious and I can't even begin to pick my favorite because everything is so good.   What I really love though is the atmosphere. Whether you sit inside or out, it's great... but I always try and sit on the patio. There's nothing like enjoying a beautiful Scottsdale day overlooking the Arizona Canal.  With new restaurants constantly opening and closing, I'm glad that Olive and Ivy has stood for so long and I hope it's around for many more years."}
{"text":"Very nice place, Ate on outdoor patio. Shared a bottle of really good Riesling wine. All the food we had was very good."}
{"text":"3.5 stars - overall pleased, would adopt as a happy hr. standby, rated downward b/c food was decent, not raveworthy.  Quite pleasantly surprised to discover this airy, spacious resto-lounge in Scottsdale Fashion Sq. Stopped in during happy hr. on a Thursday, decent mix of patrons. Overall space is versatile and occasion-friendly, great alfresco feel as giant oak doors were opened to the outdoor patio.  Lounge is perfect for small parties with low couches and leather sofa chair seating.  Great happy hr. specials (M-F 4-6pm) $5 small plates, well drinks, house wine, sangria.   Prosciutto bruschetta w/crescenza cheese, arugula & fig preserves was perfectly balanced. Italian sausage flatbread w/pequillo peppers & goat cheese - the peppers and goat cheese made this flatbread, the sausage was overly crumbled and didn't add much flavor. The cheese plate was fine - a mild blue and a mild Spanish cheese, plated with thinly sliced apples, marinated in a fruit jam.  Apparently, they're serving a $20 3-course prix-fixe w/several interesting options through 10/31. Menu here: http://www.foxrc.com/downloads/menus/O&I_Prix_Fixe_Menu.pdf  Cons: White (pink) sangria was prettily presented sugar-rimmed, but served sans fruit (odd). Have had much better sangria. Service was spotty but potentially b/c bartender was doubling as our server, other servers ended up busing our table and were helpful.  Look forward to checking out other Fox concepts True Food Kitchen and Zinburger."}
{"text":"Used to be okay. Now it's getting a bit greasy joint with half of its  menu always not available. They need to hire somebody to keep the front area clean. A bit pricey but at least it's fresh - so s'okay for an airport. Service is helpful. Don't forget to be friendly when you order as this place is run by boys and girls from da hood. Give 3* and will not to upset them... ;)"}
{"text":"Quick service and decent food. Wanted the chopped salad but it's not actually chopped ....?? The counter guy didn't even know what the difference between a chopped salad and a normal salad was.... Pretty sad...."}
{"text":"I don't know what was better, the food or the service? Great patio on the water. Delicious vodka mule. Sweet potato cannelloni with roasted almonds. Tres leches lemon meringue cake. YUM! Can't wait to go back and try other dishes....too bad I don't live in Scottsdale.  P.s. Any dish is available to go in their market section."}
{"text":"This was an excellent experience.  Found this location on Yelp while looking for a nice lunch.  Easy parking, nice facility and very very nice people.  The yelp menu had the Pastrami sandwich that sounded so good but when we arrived, it was not on the menu.    I mentioned it to the very nice server and a few minutes later, she comes back over and tells me that they will make it special.  I did not ask, just went out of their way to do something nice for a customer.  The overall experience was excellent and the Pastrami was really good too.  I actually am looking forward to going back..."}
{"text":"We kind of liked this place, but probably won't be back unless we're shopping nearby. Unlike some other posters, we received excellent and attentive service -- walked in with no reservation just before 5 pm on Saturday and while we couldn't get patio seating, we got a nice table right away. The food was a bit inconsistent, though. The bruschetta was cold -- flavor was good, but would have tasted better hot. Hubby and I split the scallop entree and the ravioli entree -- again, the service was terrific, in that they split them both for us without us having to ask. And, the flavor, seasoning and texture of both were excellent...but the food didn't arrive hot. Desert of coconut cake was forgettable."}
{"text":"The decor of this place is great.  Very classy and well put together.  I was a little disappointed with the food.  The bruschetta was lacking in flavor.  Some of the toppings didn't taste that great together.  It wasn't bad, but I won't be back to have that again.  The veal and spinach ravioli was good.  I thought there was a sharp cheesy flavor that was almost too much.  I split that plate with my mom and thank god I did cause I could only handle eating three ravioli due to the rich flavor.  I won't be ordering that again. Overall if I were to come back, I'd order completely different menu items.  I just wasn't impressed with my choices this time :/"}
{"text":"I hate to leave a bad review because I really like the decor and feel of this place. I have been here three times in the past year and I am just not crazy about the new menu. My husband had the lasagna last night and could not eat it. It looked like it had been reheated for three days in a row. He is actually sick with some kind of stomach virus today and I am thinking about calling the restaurant. I had the flatbread and it was not near as good as my last visit here 3 months ago. I probably won't return. For the price there are much better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I have been coming here with my family for years and they always provide great service.  The only downside is that if you are going on a weekend day or a busy peak time, you MUST make a reservation or you will not get a seat. The bar and marketplace area is open seating but the patio here is the best place to sit. The Fritto Misto is the best dish ever by the way. I love the Fox Restaurant Concepts.   Thank you again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Incredible, fast service and fabulous outdoor dining experience! Definitely coming here again and would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. The food, service, and atmosphere here is amazing. I brought my Mom, Aunt, and Grandma here for lunch and they absolutely loved it. Mark Anthony helped make the experience exceptional through his incredible customer service, attentive nature, and spot on recommendations. I really can't say enough about this place or the server."}
{"text":"Great outdoor seating by fire pit.  Appetizers really good as well. Great people watching on weekends."}
{"text":"If you come here, Sit in the booth facing outside. And have Easton as your server. He is amazing, this place is amazing: Thank you again Easton!"}
{"text":"My wife and i enjoy having a meal after taking in a movie in the Scottsdale Fashion mall.. sitting in the patio area only if the weather permits is the way to go... good place"}
{"text":"The food, service and setting are perfect for a spring time lunch. We were celebrating two birthdays and our server Carlos made it even more special by bringing us two delicious desserts to share. I would highly recommend Olive & Ivy."}
{"text":"I have been here for brunch twice, absolute best mimosas. Breakfast sandwich is awesome and the food was good. The restaurant is also big and good atmosphere. Good for large groups too and they take reservations."}
{"text":"I'm kind of obligated to love this place, because my wife and I had our first date here AND I proposed to her here (she said yes, too).  Obviously, the restaurant holds lots of sentimental value to us, and I love that.  I also love the food and wine menu.  We've tried many of the entrees, including the Braised Short Ribs and Rack of Lamb, all of which were outstanding.  We've also ordered many of the red wines, and always enjoyed our selections.  Nearly everything on the dinner and wine list is pricey, but it's also worth it, so go there when you can enjoy it.  The big BUT I have to include here is that we've had both exceptional service and terrible service.  On at least three or four occasions, our service was fast and friendly, just what you want.  The last time we visited Olive & Ivy was for our one-year wedding anniversary.  I called ahead, made reservations, and told the hostess over the phone what we were celebrating and the fact that I had proposed to my wife there as well.  Once there, no one ever wished us a happy anniversary, and we were sat in, possibly, the worst location in the restaurant, adjacent to a door (in January) that was constantly being opened and closed.  It actually looked like the table was placed there at the last minute, because no one would ever want to sit that close to a cold drafty door in January.  Not only that, but our server was unfamiliar with the wine list and couldn't give us any recommendations on appetizers (she said everything was good).  Hopefully, that one bad server is no longer there, and everything is back to the way it was.  If so, I'd recommend Olive & Ivy to anyone!"}
{"text":"We had a group of 5 come here last weekend and had the pleasure of having Victoria helping our table out.  The food was delicious.  My girlfriend and I loved that everything was made from scratch.  She had a chicken salad, which was amazing, I opted for a breakfast sandwich, also fantastic.  Everyone from our group enjoyed the food, and enjoyed the GREAT service from our host.  If I lived in Scottsdale, I would be here a couple times a week for sure, its too good to pass up."}
{"text":"Loved this place!!! Awesome atmosphere. Had drinks and apps by the fire pits.  Got a bunch of food to share and all was so good. Waiters were awesome and the bill came out reasonably for a group of 4. I wish we had this place in Dallas."}
{"text":"Great breakfast at the marketplace!  Highly recommend!  Wonderful portions, great coffee, great location near Fashion Square.  Dogs allowed on the marketplace patio, would have given 5 stars except for he barking puppy at the next table."}
{"text":"I miss living near here!  So good, i love the market place and their coffee is always perfect!"}
{"text":"I tried Olive & Ivy for the first time and it was amazing! I love the decorations and the atmosphere. The 2 hosts at the front, Whitney and Natalie, were really sweet and helpful when I mentioned I wanted a table outside. I got the market soup (cauliflower) which was delicious, and some of the bruschetta. Our server Joe was  awesome too! The atmosphere and food is great but the staff makes it even better Would highly recommend and I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant.  I've been here twice now, both times were excellent.  There's a huge bar area and also a big back patio with a misting system in the summer time.  Both times we've ordered the hummus.  It's that good.  It's got a lil kick to it, and it's served with pita bread.  It's excellent.  What else is excellent is their lasagna.  It's some of the best I've ever had!!!  It's served with two little amazing pieces of garlic bread, that's so yummy and pairs perfectly with the lasagna sauce.  If you're really hungry the portion is perfect, if not, it heats up well, so take it home and have it as a midnight shnack ;)  My friend ordered the Med salad and it looked really good and the portion is ginormous.  Overall, this place is awesome  and we will definitely visit again when we're on that side of town."}
{"text":"First time here. Here for lunch with family. Found on Yelp Review with attractive rating and many reviews.  Parking was fairly easy to find in a shaded parking structure. There were parking spaces available right in front of the restaurant, but we decided to park in the parking structure.   The hostess was welcoming. The restaurant presentation was a mix between industry and classic. Loved the ambiance!   We ordered Mediterranean salad with grilled chicken, Gyro sandwich, Bacon Cheeseburger, Sweet potato cannelloni, and Piccante flat bread. The server brought complimentary bread with pesto sauce which was surprisingly good! It was the BEST bread from any of the restaurants I've ever visited in my entire life!   The my unsweetened Black tropical ice tea. The tea was excellent as well as the rest of the dishes. We couldn't believe every single dish was so great!!  Our server, Mike, was top of the notch server!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have only dined here once. The restaurant is beautiful and the staff was superb. We had one of the yummiest deserts I've ever tasted. I would certainly recommend this place to our friends and family."}
{"text":"The service and the food was excellent! This was our second visit and there were no surprises; consistently great!"}
{"text":"Beautiful day on the patio!  Zach, our server, was awesome. Husband had eggs Benedict and I had the kale salad with chicken added. A bottle of rose' to share and life is good. Be sure to start with the house made focaccia and pesto."}
{"text":"Formulaic restaurant that works to move you quickly through your meal. Staff was knowledgable and had the company storyline down pat. Food was good, wine list was okay but sommelier lacked basic wine knowledge.  Appetizers were appealing. Salads had balanced flavor and showed up very quickly. Plates were removed as soon as last bite. Bread and pesto provided but only lasted on the table less than 5 minutes. We had to ask for the bread's return. Entrees tasted good too but were in the small side.  Not a bad restaurant but as I said they look to turn you in and out quickly. We were looking for something a little more relaxed."}
{"text":"The place has a great patio which although most seats were open and we came on time for our noon reservation they claimed we had to have requested it. We had an important meeting and they still stuck us next to the kitchen! They did nothing to appease us. The food is OK. For the area there are way better places. I would never recommend due to horrible hosting and management."}
{"text":"Pretty good food!  I love the bread and pesto they bring to he table.   Bacon wrapped dates were excellent. Bruschetta was excellent. Hummus was average and the pitas were pathetic  Lemonade was very good not too sweet not too sour  I had the bone in ribeye medium rare.it was very good. Uniform doneness suggests sous vide plus a quick grill.  Demi glacé was done well not too over powering and just a touch to not overpower the steak.Potatoes and spinach were a nice balance.  Service was very good. Unobtrusive but on top of making sure drinks were refilled food plates out of the way etc  Only knock is the music is waaaaaay too loud.  Turn it down!"}
{"text":"I tried to take my secretary here for lunch Friday. They were busy, and I had no reservation. Totally understandable, we'll go somewhere else. However, they said we could sit at the bar which was wide open. Silly me; I didn't think they meant it literally! We did sit there, totally ignored for 10 minutes. No water, no \"we'll be right with you.\" We were simply invisible. The worst part? There were 4-5 employees standing around doing nothing. We gave up and left. Bye, Felicia!"}
{"text":"The bread, the ambiance and the bruschetta alone are worth visiting this quaint restaurant located on the waterfront.  Such a relaxing last lunch before heading home to Chicago."}
{"text":"We love the location of this place and their food. The patio is great and there's lots of open space. On weekends there are sometimes open air markets along the canal. We are thinking about coming here after our wedding rehearsal."}
{"text":"So this was my fourth time at Olive and Ivy before writing a review.     The first three times were at breakfast where we utilized the the little marketplace they have.  I really enjoyed going there, a little over priced but good food and a great atmosphere.   This last time I was at Sunday brunch with my girls and it sucked!!!  Sangria in a carafe $20!!!!  Granted the white sangria is pretty amazing. ..but geesh!  It doesn't even look pretty!  No pretty fruit floating around or anything.   What really brings my review down was the gyro.  It sucked.  Wilted lettuce, a tomato that looked like it had been sliced last week and cold fries.  I get that they were trying to time it out right after our appetizer but letting it die in the window? ... that is just bad service.  And at $12 it should have have been perfect.  Soooo...I will be trying some new places and staying away from here."}
{"text":"Amazing food and outstanding service! Plus the gelato is sooooo yummy and refreshing!"}
{"text":"The location and vibe in this place are great. The patron is lovely along the canal. Go for drinks and really enjoy yourselves. But I have been consistently disappointed by the food. Oily pasta dishes, lackluster flavors. Sorry that I cannot recommend this place for food. I do check it out every once in a while, but my last time was a few years ago. So, take this review with a grain of salt, but don't blame me if the food isn't up to your standards."}
{"text":"Dined here at 3pm and it was fairly busy, but we got seated immediately. We asked if we could have the dinner menu in the happy hour area and were told that the lounge was strictly HH which was odd. So we sat at a table in the patio with dinner menus. The menu was pretty good however they are only limited to half the dinner menu at 3 which didn't make sense to give a full dinner menu , but we did with it.  We order a bruschetta with too much cheese and no spicy chorizo, the lamb meat balls which I enjoyed and the short rib flatbread which I loved! The service was ok. We ordered wines and our server spilt over an ounce on the table and cleaned off the menus but not the table which really made it uncomfortable to eat knowing I had puddles around me , also I didn't get that lost wine back. Bottom line, food is good, ambiance is great, and service was ok. Will potentially return , but definitely no rush"}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy is one of the best places to go in Scottsdale for a lovely weekend breakfast or my personal favorite, Sunday brunch.  The food is beyond delicious - my favorite is the egg sandwich that comes complete with avocado, egg, cheese, mayo, bacon, and all served on a deliciously fluffy croissant. My sister loves the hanger steak with eggs and asparagus too!  The staff is very nice and accommodating. Olive and Ivy serves potatoes on the side of my egg sandwich, but they are always eager to please me when I ask or a fruit salad instead - sweet juicy fresh fruit in a bowl is the perfect addition to a delectable breakfast sandwich.   I also highly suggest the morning cocktails. My mother and I visit Olive and Ivy EVERY time she is in town. She loves the Peach Bellini and has actually made me a fan as well although their white sangria (which is actually pink) as a perfect morning pick me up!   If you get a chance to visit Olive and Ivy I would STRONGLY recommend it! Best breakfast in Scottsdale. It is beyond affordable for how delicious the food is and how great the service is!"}
{"text":"Very good food and a beautiful setting. My only complaint is the fact that they seat you as if they are doing you a favor by letting you eat there."}
{"text":"I typically go to Olive and Ivy often. I even had my bridal shower at the restaurant in October. My friend wanted to eat here on her birthday which was on Valentine's Day. She had made a reservation for 5 people. Our server Bart was very nice, however, Heather, one of the managers, was EXTREMELY rude. She came over and she said that she had a reservation that had been waiting for 30 minutes for our table on the patio. This happened less than five minutes after our gelato and drinks had hit the table. I still had a full glass and half of the dessert left (that took over 15 minutes after ordering to be brought to the table). All 5 of us are in the industry, so we are all pretty understanding and we know how stressful it can be, but we would never speak to anyone how Heather spoke to us. She then went on to blame the late joiners, which was my husband and I. She was inconsiderate, loud and disrespectful. I told her we will leave as soon as we are finished with our drinks and desserts. At this point, we still haven't even received our split checks! She stood against the wall and stared at us for about five minutes and came over again with a male manager and said \"Like I said before, I need your table.\" (WHILE I HAD MY MOUTH COMPLETELY FULL OF FOOD.) We were all shocked in disbelief and completely embarrassed while other people at surrounding tables stared at the ordeal taking place. We asked to speak to the general manager and Heather would not budge until I had to demand to speak to the general manager. When the general manager Kim came over, we expressed our concerns about Heather's attitude. Kim went on to tell us that this reservation had been waiting over an hour for the table (when five minutes before that Heather said 30) and that they were busy, which is a good problem to have. One of our friends mentioned to Kim that we wouldn't have minded if we were completely finished or if they offered to move us to another table inside. We told the manager this and SHE STILL DIDN'T OFFER TO! We had planned to stay and drink more but we decided to spend our money elsewhere. The server even came by and felt the need to apologize for both of the managers poor reaction to the situation. As we got up and walked through the inside of the restaurant there were over 6 tables open. Needless to say, We will not be going back to this restaurant anytime soon. The staff has always been so friendly but there is extremely poor management. I left Olive and Ivy feeling embarrassed and disrespected, not how you want to feel after celebrating a friends birthday."}
{"text":"I went here tonight for my boyfriend's birthday (11/11/11). First let me say the five star rating was for our waitress Andrea. She was amazing. The atmosphere was great...a little loud but died down after 11pm.  Andrea was very prompt, polite, and quick to make recommendations (which were all great). I asked if they could make a chicken alfredo dinner because I didn't see it on the menu and they were more than happy to accommodate, making the alfredo fresh! At the end of dinner I asked Andrea if she could do something for my boyfriend's birthday and without question she quickly brought a strawberry shortcake to the table. Tasted amazing and she even comped the price of dessert. If it weren't for Andrea I'd have given a 4 star review only because it was slightly pricey.  Overall food and  atmosphere were great, but the service was exceptional! Thanks Andrea for making our night special!"}
{"text":"Good food, good happy hour.  Kinda of a trendy see and be scene Scottsdale place.  I do enjoy their patio on the canal."}
{"text":"Stopped for a glass of wine and ended up staying for a couple plus appetizers. The patio was so inviting and comfortable; service was good; food was great. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"For an airport terminal establishment, this place is top notch.  Ordered a sandwich, grabbed a seat and it was delivered to me like at one of their traditional restaurants. The place was JAMMED, but my sandwich came out very quickly.  The food was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food, great service.  Portion sizes were good and the apps delivered as expected.  great happy hour spot..."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch with some friends and the food was wonderful! Our waiter was Mark Anthony, made our experience that more enjoyable. Martins were nice... They need to step it up in this area. They could learn a few more twist on different ways to serve up a really great Martini by Venturing out side the box... Food was wonderful. Everything was cooked from scratch... From the flat breads, to the Turkey grinder. My Mediterranean salad was ok, not the best and could have used more ingredients (dated, currents, chicken, curry, other spices to take it to the next level). The restaurant sits on the river so the ambiance was nice...  They still need some work in the creativity department. They own many other restaurants through out AZ and rest of the  Country. Maybe they should think about hiring me as a consultant to kick it up to the next level.... If there was my creativity then just the standard mix of food, I would have given it more stars. $5 dollars for s tiny piece of bruschetta with, cheese prosciutto and they forgot the fig jam was a bit much. Messed up the drink order... But the experience was pleasurable. The waiter did his best, but they others fell short... The mixologist behind the bar could use some more experience and should learn to kick it up a notch... Chef as well. May be too many balls in the air that they are trying to juggle!"}
{"text":"Very delicious brunch.  Great drinks.  Super chic decor."}
{"text":"Gonna be real blunt, the food here is on the better end of the spectrum when it comes to grab and go airport fare, but the line and service is average on its best day and atrocious more often than not. For one I don't understand the point of having a bunch of premade sandwiches and salads in the counter coolers if you're just gonna make them fresh every time regardless. Like I honestly wonder when they actually sell any of those things I see every time I'm inching through the line.   Also doesn't help that they have 3 diff ppl taking orders, just adds to the confusion and chaos. Meanwhile I observed at least 3 employees not actually doing anything, one guy was calling out orders but not actually making anything, like why? On this most recent visit I literally just waited 10 min extra bc they just straight up forgot to make my order, putting into perspective just how useless it is  to just call out an order to someone without follow through. I had to remind someone to check on it after I clearly saw 3 ppl working on orders placed 7 or 8 behind me, with no one making me a \"fresh\" salad until I asked. No oops, or sorry, just business as usual here. They hand you a # when you order and it's worthwhile to remember you are just that, a number, when you decide to get food here, nothing more."}
{"text":"Conflicted about how to write this review, since I actually ended up getting sick after my meal, and so did two of my friends the week prior. BUT still three stars because it's actually awesome. If we didn't get sick, easily a 4 or 5. Could have just been a weird coincidence!   First of all the place is ADORABLE. The inside is great, but the outside patio is amazingly beautiful. It's right on the water and there are cute string lights and fountains. It looks like a European garden. There are misters so don't worry about being too hot during the summer.   You HAVE to try the bruschetta board. It's fantastic. The bread is so fresh and the toppings were perfect. For my meal I ordered the chicken and mashed potatoes. It was flavored really well... the only thing I wish was that the skin was crispy. And for my favorite part: dessert. We had the strawberry shortcake. Amazing.   SO if you have a strong stomach, try it. If you don't, try it and bring Tums just in case. It's worth it."}
{"text":"This place is doing something right to fill the place. Low expectations in servuce and food taste must be par for the course. Six of us ate there. Not one of us finished nor did one of us really enjoy the meal. Environment is nice, server was awesome but hostesses all were all a bit kitschy and stuck in their clique. Had reservations for six and the couldn't nor would attempt to try and seat us together. No smiles, no personal interaction and no interest in assisting us. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Had a weird experience coming here for happy hour with coworkers. The manager redeemed it in the end, but it was still quite off-putting.  We had a group of about 20 people from work, who were going out as a farewell to one of our colleagues. Someone in our party had called Olive & Ivy the week before to ask if we could make a reservation since we had a large group. She was told that they don't take reservations for happy hour, but that since we'd be coming in on a Tuesday, it shouldn't be any problem to seat our whole group. Sounded great.  Our group arrived, and there was only enough \"happy hour\" seating available for about half of our group... despite the fact that there were many other open tables throughout the restaurant. Half of our group sat, while the other half tried to figure out what to do. Finally we asked about taking one of the other nearby tables that was empty (unfortunately not next to the rest of the group), and we were told we could sit there. The stray half of our group sat down, the server brought us water, and then left. She came back, dropped off an appetizer that our boss had bought for us, and then told us \"I can't have you guys sitting here. We have to leave these tables open for dinner service. I'm gonna need to have you clear out of here by 5.\" (It was 4:45.) So we asked \"Do you have another table we can go to? We were told we could sit here.\" She said there were no other tables we could move to, since the rest of the \"happy hour\" section was full. Mind you, most of the group was going to order non-happy-hour food.  The server walked away. Our half of the group (still removed from the rest of coworkers, including our departing friend who the whole outing was for) was left to figure out what to do. Honestly, we didn't really have any options... there was nowhere we were \"allowed\" to sit, so they were essentially just kicking us out of the restaurant even though we were ready to be paying customers. We hadn't even had the chance to order a drink. It was very awkward and rude.  As we were about to leave, a manager suddenly came over and told us he had made space for us in the happy hour section next to the rest of our group. We were immediately seated in that section, and were finally treated like normal customers. We enjoyed ourselves from that point on, but none of us could believe how poorly the situation was handled up until then.   The food and drinks were good, not great. I gave this place 3 stars instead of 2 only because the manager handled things right. It's just a shame it took so long for that to happen. This was my first time at Olive & Ivy, and I definitely wouldn't come here again by my own choice."}
{"text":"Amazing!! That is the best word to describe this place!! Everything was perfect from walking I to the fun ambiance, to the perfect drinks and the most amazing food! Not a thing was wrong. Great service and such a knowledgeable waiter!!! Please bring this place to Houston!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food. I always appreciate freshly made items that are healthy and this place has a lot. Nice patio, staff is friendly. I'm giving it 4/5 stars due to the atmosphere at night. I have been here during the day and it is pleasant. At night the place turns into what I like to call \"The Scottsdale wannabe rich dude hang out,\" full of over plastic surgery individuals.. Not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here & the food is amazing!! But the real recognition I'd like to give is to our server, Jeremy, he went above and beyond to provide exceptional service! He was so smiley, polite and had immense knowledge of the menu and great recommendations! Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"What an incredible meal!! Had a reservation for 7 on a Tuesday. There was a sight delay for our reservation and they brought us water and bread with pesto to the patio. Went above and beyond for service and menu choice. Meal was absolutely delicious! Everything from the bacon wrapped dates and artichoke hearts appetizers to the salmon and steaks, PERFECT! Donovan was our server and he went out of his way to make sure we had an incredible meal. Will definitely eat here every time we're in town!"}
{"text":"So, my daughters and I wanted to dine there Sat nite but we were unable to get a reservation. But we did get one for brunch on Sunday. We were very excited to experience the outdoor patio. Sadly, our experience was filled with lows and highs. Our waiter provided very poor service. When I asked the origin of the House sparkling wine for the mimosas he could only respond that \"yeah it's good.\" Our food orders were completely incorrect, poached eggs looked inedible but were delivered to my one daughter. We asked for the manager. She was lovely and responsive. We were delivered a whole new cream fast. And we expressed our appreciation. But unfortunately my other daughters over easy eggs were swimming in a pool of grease. When the manager checked in with us again she comped the whole meal. The lows were that the meal was only ok and the service awful. But the highs were that the manager really cared about us and took care of us. We have high expectations for Olive and Ivy. And they need to do better for brunch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Scottsdale for dinner or just drinks. Amazing atmosphere, music, food on point and staff! Love it!"}
{"text":"We've celebrated anniversaries and business deals that have closed here so obviously I like it. :) I've only gone for dinner and happy hour and the ambiance is always upscale, trendy yet refined.  You see all ages groups represented and quite a few tourist in the mix.  I've had the Veal & Spinach Ravioli, Sea Bass, Sea Scallops - all very good.  Taste and presentation is important to them so I don't think you can go wrong with anything from their menu.  Overall one of my favorite places to dine."}
{"text":"I hate it that I love it....Fox Restaurants are taking over, but this place is great. The bread and pesto are amazing. I have never ordered something that I didnt like. The prices more than fair for the quality of service and deliciousness of the food."}
{"text":"This is one of my fave places to go during the week if I'm in the area. I love the vibe, the food and the drinks. The service is always good."}
{"text":"I have to say that our recent trip  overall was a pleasant.  My only complaint would be with the host staff.  We had made a reservation with open-table.com and shortly after Leaving we received a No Show email from open table.  I assume that the Hostess did not know how to check someone in that had a reservation.  While this was eventually resolved I did take several calls and emails to do so and they only way it was closed was for us to provide a copy of the receipt to open table to verify that were had arrived for our reservation.  While the service, food, and beverages were fantastic the attention to detail needs just a bit of polishing."}
{"text":"I really loved the lighting, staff, crowd and overall ambience of this place. Colorful booths and their patio is awesome with couches and Edison lights. Unless you make a reservation, you most likely will have to wait though. The hostess was super sweet and our waitress was as well. Very friendly vibe here.   Items we tried and truly enjoyed were:  Classic Caesar salad (huge bowl-very filling and fresh) Beet salad (smaller portion served in a flat rectangle plate) Mozzarella bruschetta (all the brushettas were bomb) Prosciutto bruschetta  Brussels sprout bruschetta  Chicken and barely soup (could tell it was homemade) Lasagna Margarita pizza (nothing special, basic pizza) Spanish shrimp risotto (AMAZING!!! Cooked to perfection) I must add that one of the highlights is that they stuff their own blue cheese olives and make their own blue cheese as well...so the martinis are extra good ;)"}
{"text":"I liked the ambiance. It's a big venue with nice outside setting. The food was good. I wasn't a fan of what I ordered ( sweet potato cannelloni) too sweet and too oily. But the scallops and sea bass were delicious. A good overall experience."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a number of times for dinner, (2ppl-8ppl), Happy Hour, Breakfast and today, lunch.   it is always a perfectly wonderful experience. The ambiance is beautiful to start with. The hostess is always great, service great, food great, drinks great!   I love walking up to Olive and Ivy for breakfast. They make the BEST yogurt/fruit/granola bowl anywhere. The coffee is good. I have never had  bad or mediocre service there.   It's a great place for a date, business meeting, special event dinner party, girls lunch, happy hour...etc... etc..   Advice to mgmt- Keep up the good work.   P.S. While I've always had good service here; today I had a server named Tommy. A++++++ The perfect mixture of personality, service and leaving you alone while being attentive. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Ok. Let me start by saying that the atmosphere of Olive & Ivy is gorgeous! I will take you through our meal so you know why we didn't love this...let me also disclose that my opinion made even me sad! I started off with a glass of white wine. I got the Chenin Blanc. The wine was delicious BUT it was wayyyy too warm. Having such and extensive wine collection, they should have known to serve more chilled white wine. I could have said something but I didn't, so that is my fault. Every table gets fresh bread and pesto. This was probably the highlight of the meal. It is seriously DELICIOUS! We decided to start with the bacon wrapped dates, recommended by our server. They were...ok. The dates were a bit too smokey and needed more of a salty element. Even with the chorizo and bacon, I found them to be much too sweet. They also had some greenery that was unnecessary. For my meal, I got 3 of the bruschetta. Great concept! You can choose 3 flavors for $12. Sounds amazing right!? BEWARE. The menu discloses GF and Veg. Again, this was MY FAULT but, the menu didn't list all of the ingredients and all of the bruschetta options have cheese on them. I don't eat dairy....so, I basically suffered through my entire meal. The brussels sprout option was 100% the best. The mushroom was pretty good and the prosciutto was less than impressive, unfortunately. My sister got the scallops and said they were pretty good and cooked perfectly! They come with 5 as well as some hearty butternut squash puree. There were chunks of squash that she said were a bit overwhelming and a bit rich. They were missing depth and needed a bit of acidity.   Overall, this wasn't a BAD meal but we were expecting a lot more. I would try it again but I would be much more cautious of what I was ordering and next time I will probably ask for more chilled wine."}
{"text":"Wow. Never been so disrespected on the phone after THEY failed to change my reservation time. I called them yesterday to adjust my reservation from 10:00 AM to 12:15 PM then preceded to realize this morning that it was not changed after receiving an email saying they missed me at my reservation. The food may be fairly good, but if there are employees at this place who are rude to their customers (especially when they make a mistake), I wouldn't go here."}
{"text":"For airport food, their Greek salad is solid. It has plenty of veggies and they usually have some already prepared. So you can grab one and go.  My one tip for some of their salads would be to ask for extra dressing on the side since they don't put enough on."}
{"text":"This is our to-go-to place when visitors come to town. Always great service. Love starting with the focaccia & fresh pesto. The bruschetta appetizers are excellent. Some favorites are the flatbreads, sea scallops, sea bass, Mediterranean salad, sweet potato cannelloni and peanut butter mousse dessert!"}
{"text":"The salad here is amazing. My friend got a flatbread and it was great. Not too many options for gluten free if you don't like salad but my salad was delicious. Really nice outdoor seating with view of the waterfront. Really nice workers. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"Not a fan.  The food was good, but it only had 9 bites total in my bowl.  I ate 4 rations of bread to fill up and used the sauce from my pasta.  Scottsdale prices, McDonald's dollar menu portions. Walk across the street and go to The Herb Box."}
{"text":"When I like something I tend to order it again...and again...and again.  After a morning hike at Camelback Gabi M and I stopped by here for breakfast. I ordered their breakfast smoothie (mmm) and an egg white omelette, served with tomatoes and avocado. Oh, and a side of fruit too!  I liked it so much that when we finished our workout the next morning I asked if we could go back to Olive and Ivy. Same order this time around, but this time I added cheddar cheese to the omelette. They put a layer of cheese on top (rather than inside), which isn't how I usually like it, but this was actually really good.  I was bummed when I ran out of time on my 3rd morning in Phoenix to stop by for my usual breakfast, but I hope to be back next time."}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy is the perfect place for a girl's dinner!  Went here with a friend during the week.  We waited about 15 minutes for a table outside and grabbed drinks at the bar.  We sat outside which was in a cute garden with tables and even couches for large groups.  It was right on the waterway and had a nice view of other buildings in the area.  When we were seated, the waiter was fine that we ordered drinks at the bar which is always a good way to start out dinner!  My friend and I split a salad and a flatbread which were the perfect amount of food.  The chopped mediterranean salad was awesome.  I have no idea why it tasted so good but it did.  Our flatbread was unique and very good with asparagus and mushrooms which I normally don't like but they made this taste great."}
{"text":"After spending what turned out to be the best Thanksgiving of my life with the love of my life and her truly amazing vegetarian family in Scottsdale, I looked forward to continuing the holiday into the next day at Olive & Ivy. One would think that after a Thanksgiving meal of salmon (that's the extent of the meat that was served), an assortment of vegetables, and Gouda grits, I would be dying for some meat. Not the case at all.   The mall to which this restaurant was attached was bustling with half crazed Black Friday shoppers; however, once inside we were led into a private room that must have been designed precisely for our party of ten.   I began my meal with the heirloom beet salad with pistachio and goat cheese dressing, followed by the smoked salmon flatbread. They were both out of this world. The couple of bites that I had of my lady's sea bass with wild mushroom ravioli, Brussels Sprouts and roasted squash confirmed to me that this place will not disappoint with any dish that you might order. I caution you, however, do not fill up on the delicious bread and pesto that they serve with the meal.   The wine list seemed a bit eclectic, and I would have loved to try something new, or the \"kilt lifter\" beer, but my goal to get the body fat below five percent limited my drink of choice to Grey Goose on the rocks. Next time maybe.   Save room for a cookie or gelato from the adjoining marketplace. This restaurant has the concept of restaurant and marketplace nailed. It was for me one of my high culinary experiences with plenty of love and friendship to go around. I know what you're thinking. How will I get to five percent BF while consuming flatbread and cookies? Well, how much willpower do you expect me to have after three vodkas?"}
{"text":"Wow! We had a fab dinner AND a great experience. Josh P (aka Detroit) was our server and his attentive energy was astounding and made my husband's birthday dinner one of his favorites. Dan enjoyed the bouillabase...every single saffron kissed drop. The sea bass was amazingly light with little gifts of grapefruit zest to bring out the flavor. We started by sharing a duo of greens.. the warm artichoke salad and the chilled beet salad. Yum! Josh made great recommendations and they were spot on. All in all...Josh made the evening amazing. We also appreciated Matt, the manager, informing us about all their restaurants in the area that are chef driven. We cannot wait to try them all!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I loved this place, but they seem to have changed their menu without notification online.  I took my wife there for her bday on a Saturday at 2:30.  We both looked at the menu online and decided they had what we wanted.  When we for there, we were given a totally different menu which had nothing that we had picked.  I'm guessing it was their new lunch menu.  It didn't even include their bruschetta which we love getting every time we go.  We were told we could sit at the bar for over a half an hour for their limited dinner menu to kick in, but that is unacceptable.  We ended up leaving and will probably never return since they did seem to care why we decided to leave.  A company without concern for their patrons is a company that won't get our money.  I hope in the future they decide to go back to a menu that actually has some substance, but I would bet money on them staying the course, even though it has alienated at least us as customers."}
{"text":"Was an impromptu dining visit and did not have a reservation but we were greeted quickly and told of our seating options without a reservation, we opted to done outside on the patio since it was a nice evening, we were given a table along the canal and it was perfect.  Our server was also fantastic!  We decided to do the AZ Restaurant Week menu as the options were just perfect for what we were looking for.  The fresh bread and pesto that were brought to the table was delicious.  The bacon wrapped dates were amazing, and not a small portion  either. I had the white bean and kale minestrone and it was also very good. For dinner we had seared scallops over a sweet corn and asparagus, and bacon wrapped pork tenderloin with fingerling potatoes and swiss chard.  The scallops were cooked great and the corn and asparagus very tasty.  The pork was cooked to perfection, moist and melted in your mouth with the smokiness of the bacon just yummy.  For dessert we chose the chocolate mousse and apple crisp.  The mousse was a perfect size and not too sweet.  The apple crisp was a bit disappointing, it was extremely soupy, which our server also recognized but said there was no manager to tell.  Over all a great evening."}
{"text":"Excellent first time experience. Service was superb.  Can't wait to bring my friends here for our annual girls trip!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't it be nice to write a decent review for an airport restaurant without biasing your information to the location?  Airport food doesn't have to be good, so it usually is not.  O&I tries a little harder, but still falls into this category.  It did hook me from the start, in that it did not LOOK like your typical airport place.  The menu on the wall appeared hand-made, the food choices were creative and attractive.  They even have a coffee bar displaying a list of real espresso drinks!    Execution, on the other hand, wasn't what I was hoping for.  All the signs of fast-food were there: sloppy assembly, cold-in-the-middle-hot-on-the-outside temperature distribution, and an ordering process that confused everyone.  But most of all, the menu items were fast-food sized.  Two sandwiches would have been a more appropriate order for my meager frame.  And the coffee?  It was ok, I'll give it that much.  Maybe some day the world will find an airport restaurant that doesn't capitalize on it's captive customer base by providing a truly decent meal.  O&I isn't there yet."}
{"text":"Very, very nice!    Went for New Year's Day lunch and the place was packed so service was a bit strained but understandably.   Wish there would have been tables available on the patio as it's gorgeous out there.  Nevertheless the interior is also very attractive.  The warm foccacia bread with pesto was awesome and complimentary.   We had an amazing butternut squash and shrimp soup to take the chill out on a cold afternoon.   My husband had the goat cheese and duck confit tortellini (fresh), I had the lasagna bolognese and my son had the salmon.  All were perfectly cooked.   For dessert we shared the cheesecake.  The only thing we found odd was that the lasagna was served in a bowl and the cheesecake in a mason type jar.  Nevertheless the flavors were there!  We will be back to check out the dinner menu for sure."}
{"text":"We had a delicious Valentine's Day celebration dinner including dessert and a great server who took time to be courteous  And they gave us all the time we needed to relax and enjoy our meal We also want to thank the hostess for seating us in a great spot that was not in a crowded area so we had privacy in a booth so we could have a conversation  And we were both happy with our meals We will go back for sure and not just for a holiday event as it is in the neighborhood and a great restaurant for the price"}
{"text":"We sat out on the patio celebrating with a few and it was just amazing!  The atmosphere on the lake front is beautiful on a gorg day!  We only had enough time for a champagne toast but I will definitely come back for dinner.  I love just hanging out casually in a stunning restaurant."}
{"text":"Great location along the river, food was very good and portions were good.  All food was specially prepared while you waited.  The bar area was right beside the dining tables.  The people there were a little loud causing us to speak louder while eating in the dining area . It was a little distracting, but not bad. Still very nice place,  and I highly recommend it. Our server was Angelo. He made us feel welcome and paid attention to us while we were there. The Marriott Courtyard Concierge recommended it as a nice place for a sit down dinner."}
{"text":"Was here for a quick 2 hour Happy Hour thingy. The patio is great with lots of tables and a firepit in the corner. They have a special happy Hour menu, but watch out for the Brushetta part. The prices at $3 are attractive, but they are only giving you $3 worth of food, not a Happy Hour deal or anything. The pumpkin/Hazelnut cheese concoction wasn't even good, moreorless worth the $3 it cost for one slice of bread cut up into three pieces. Are you really that freakin cheap people? It was unhappy Hour in terms of food, but they had AZ craft beers for $5 at HH and although that isn't a great deal, it's the best you can find in this upscale happy hour, which should be renamed. Waitress was nice and staff was polite, but also an aging crowd was hanging out at the bar if your into grey, then head that way."}
{"text":"This place had amazingly good food and service! We went there Saturday night and had an amazing experience from the start to the end. We made reservations a week in advance and highly recommend doing it otherwise you most likely will have to wait."}
{"text":"good food, great ambience, reasonable prices, and great variety. minus one star because service could have been better.  for lunch, try the lamb gyro or turkey sandwich."}
{"text":"I have lived near here and had never made it before today. The patio is perfect. They have comfy couches and chairs set for large groups or multiple small parties. The patio overlooks the canal and has misters to keep you cool.   I came in between lunch and dinner so they had a restricted dinner menu. I got some bruschetta (fungi) and thought it was very tasty. I love mushrooms and it was piled high.   Great lounge spot for nice days!"}
{"text":"So I received emails from Olive and Ivy asking when we were there,etc., I provided the information and sent them a picture of the lame sandwich and now nobody gets back to me!  Why bother asking questions if they don't get back to you!  Will NEVER go back to this place."}
{"text":"The entrance was confusing.  When you walk in its like a deli and to the back is the restaurant.  The employees look at you like you are an idiot and then finally they break down and point to the back where the restaurant is.  The hostess station had 3 or 4 people standing around and one extremely rude girl that took charge.  We asked how long the wait was it was a long time but she said you can go to the back patio and possibly get a seat.  We had never been there before so we asked is there a table available?  The rude girls response was \"we dont know\" since its first come we dont keep track of it for you.  you will have to see if there is one available.  We walked through and obviously there was no open table which the dumb B already knew.  Really bad vibe from this place.  Really rude staff.  Staff seems ultimately annoyed that you had the audacity to walk in and expect to eat there.  It was almost like \"is this really happening right now?\"   That was our first and last visit we walked out after the hostess was a big b and I was completely bummed because the restaurant is beautiful.  I have wanted to try it for a few years now but I cant put up with that kind of treatment.  The management here must be the absolute worst otherwise there wouldnt be so many hateful people working here."}
{"text":"We originally came to grab a drink prior to dinner but came back for lunch the next day. It's situated along the waterfront so a good place to sit outside and enjoy the breeze. There's plenty of outdoor seating. Even though it's packed, service was never lacking. The grapefruit mojito was cold and refreshing. I liked how it didn't have so much mint floating in the glass to get caught in the straw.  As for lunch I had the tuna sandwich. It's pretty standard so not much to write about but I'd order it again. Take a walk around the area after you're done. There's a lot to explore."}
{"text":"Vegan option: Ask for a veggie sandwich with artichokes, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, and spinach!!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and incredible small plates! Haven't had dinner there yet but sure we will.   I'm going back just for the bread and pesto--amazing!!   Boyfriend had the chicken flatbread with pine nuts  and it was great"}
{"text":"Loved our meal out on the beautiful patio. Mediterranean salad was great and the sweet potato pasta was out of this world-a must order if you like the sweet taste. Salmon was just ok-nothing special. Kid's each ordered flatbread pizza and delicious buttered noodles. Not your typical kid's menu items-high quality. Bread and pesto was uhhmazing that you get complimentary. Friendly staff, hot spot in town!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing cuisine and atmosphere!   Loved the design and vibe there have going. The food is amazing! Definitely recommend a reservation.   Our server was Dan and boy was he awesome. We went with my parents and we was really sweet with my father \"jokes\" haha.   You have to try the Chiefs Sample Board, it's so yummy and so different combos of flavor. I had the Natural Chicken for dinner as it's Gluten Free. (That's another bonus, there is Vegetarian & Gluten Free options available)   My dad called ahead and order a Gluten Free Dessert and it was fantastic. I definitely recommend this place and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Sandwiches have no taste. Leave at least 15 min to get your sandwich. Better to get the grab and go and bypass the people making sandwiches. Bad bad"}
{"text":"Haven't had dinner at O&I in quite a while and was very pleased with the Watermelon Salad (with avocado, goat cheese, red chili gremolata) that I enjoyed. True Foods has a delish watermelon/heirloom tomato salad on their menu, so I asked my server to add heirlooms to my salad. It came out FANTASTIC! I almost licked the plate! The light vinegairette dressing complimented by the red chili gremolata was a perfect balance of sweet and spicy. Very light and refreshing starter or meal."}
{"text":"I've only been here during Happy Hour (Mon-Fri 3-6pm) , I've tried a few of the Flatbreads and both the Red and White Sangria. The White Sangria tastes like white gummy bears so I was pumped about that.  The Flatbreads are $9 (during Happy Hour) which in my opinion is a little steep considering they aren't that big or that great. Even if I were starving and desperate, I'd still be a bit disappointed.   Here's the thing, this place like most Fox Restaurants is about the decor, ambiance and providing a \"cool \"experience. Never have I ever been to a Fox Restaurant and tasted food that made me want to go back.   It's a \"cool\" place to hang out, they also have a fun patio area but, I wouldn't recommend it for its culinary wonders or value for money."}
{"text":"What a great experience trying this place for the first time this past weekend!  If you've read my other reviews, you know I don't give 5 stars all that often. This place surprised me and delivered more than I expected.  Let's start with the food. My family and I decided to get a few small plates instead of ordering entrees.  We ordered the Fritto Misto, Lamb Meatballs, Seasonal Chef's Board and a half order of the Chicken Chopped Salad.  All were wonderful!  If I had to pick my favorite, I'd have to go with the salad.  One of the best salads I've ever had!  Who knew granola in a salad would work so well?  Our waiter was so personable and friendly.  I wish I could remember his name.  He gave good recommendations, checked on us frequently and was super attentive.  Great service goes a long way!  I will definitely be back soon.  Can't wait to try some more items off their menu!"}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere!! We always go sit on the patio for drinks. Very nice :) I think the food here is good, but it's overpriced, in my opinion (which of course this review is ;) ). We come here often just for the atmosphere and sangria. Pitcher of sangria is $20, which I think is a good deal here."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch w the fam. Egg sandwich, caramel apple pancakes, scrambled eggs w bacon, biscuits and gravy, and cinnamon roll. Oh yeah, delicious peach Bellini. Awesome pesto, devoured it. Everything was delicious. We all kept eating after we were full. Cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of the best help food alternatives I've seen any airport. They have a massive cinnamon rolls drowning in several different types of sugar creamed toppings. There are many healthy drinks fresh healthy sandwiches and a great selection of grapes. I like most about it is the protein smoothie. Reasonable priced a good size and very tasty. This is perfect for meal on the run in between flights! I will remember this my next time through this airport. Prices of moderate for the other items on the menu much lower than typical airport food. The staff was friendly and they bring the food out. A hidden gem are the power outlets on the hightops, be careful easy to miss because they have ground covers for the outlets"}
{"text":"This is a great spot to go for an afternoon drink after walking around downtown Scottsdale.   Great place to see the beautiful people of Scottsdale, if you enjoy people watching!  I loved sitting outside enjoying the wonderful weather. We had hummus and pita, which sounds boring, but it was so incredible!!   The complimentary freshly made bread with pesto was also amazing.   Their signature mule drink was light and refreshing."}
{"text":"This was the only restaurant that I didn't Yelp before trying it out.  My friends & I didn't make reservations at Cowboy Ciao so the wait was ridiculously long for a group of 9 hungry people.  We decided to take a walk around the bridge area until we noticed Olive & Ivy.  The music, lights, & patio was all it took to draw us in there for dinner.  My first thought?  Vegas ultra lounge.  There whole room was lit by candles & low-hanging lamps that appeared to drip from the ceiling like taper candles.    Most of the crowd was around the huge bar that encompassed the entrance of the restaurant or by their personal firepits in the patio so the restaurant area was open for my huge party to be seated promptly.  The free bread was so soft that I was surprised to find out it was foccacia.  It was accompanied by this basil/olive oil type of dipping sauce.  My end of the table had to quit after 3 refills because we wouldn't have any room for our meal.    I had the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin w/ risotto & swiss chard.  OMFG...I was at a loss for words.  The crisy bacon with the juicy pork tenderloin combined with that barley risotto in some brown sauce was all it took to numb my vocal chords to prevent from wasting all that energy on talking, rather than putting it to use to chew & savor my meal.  Although I wish I had ordered the Nero d' Avola like my friend to pair with my meal, I had instead used my white sangria to wash it all down.  It didn't pair well but it also didn't overpower my meal, which was the most important part.  I completed my meal with a 'Spanish Fly' which is a martini with raspberry sorbet, Grey Goose, & some other juice that I really can't remember at the moment.  It seems odd to see the scoop of raspberry sorbet make its way to the top when the martini is poured but just one sip will send you to paradise.    Oh & FYI...I barely noticed the 'marketplace'."}
{"text":"Solid food, great service.  I had the filet and it was cooked medium rare, to perfection,  This is probably the tenth time I've been here and the food has never dissapointed.  Solid menu, good service, great beverages.  If you're looking for a night out with your significant other or just a night out with friends, whether eating or just drinking, Olive & Ivy is a place to go."}
{"text":"We came to Olive & Ivy for my friend's bachelorette party his past weekend and we were all so pleased with the ambience, food, and amazing service!  We had a group of 9 and ordered the bacon wrapped dates (with sausage filling), artichoke hearts, and the white and red sangria for the table. Upon seeing that we were there for a bachelorette, the waiter brought us a round of shots!  Some girls in our group are pescatarian and vegan, and the waiter and chefs prepared breaking/dairy on the side for our appetizers and food. I really was impressed by the accommodations they made for us. Not to mention - they brought out cake and a scoop of sorbet for the bride-to-be!!   Highly recommend this restaurant for group events or even for a romantic dinner. Next time I'm in AZ, I'll definitely revisit!"}
{"text":"I've frequented Olive & Ivy several times and always had a great experience, until the last time on Sunday night. Don't get me wrong, that experience was great in the moment too - until I got home and began projectile vomiting from the food poisoning I got from the seared scallops. On the plus side, I lost 4 pounds, so there's that. Two stars for previous good experiences, no stars for puking for 17 hours straight."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon for \"brunch.\" Too noisy to carry on any type of conversation. Slow service. My food was ordinary, and the portion looked more like a side dish. Offensively small and therefore very overpriced. I couldn't wait to get out of there. I see several good reviews, but I cannot understand what all the fuss is about."}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy gets four stars for decor, atmosphere, location and overall food. But for me, I wouldn't say Olive and Ivy has the best food in Scottsdale for the price. I been here three times, and tried appetizers, entrees and desserts.   Let's talk about the wine menu, it is expansive with various wines avialable by the bottle or glass. Also O & I does have a specialty drink menu. I think the chopped chicken salad is better than the Meditteranean.. The bread they give you is light and served with a thick pesto sauce, and is very delicious.   The patio is great. As we get to the close of the fall, spring and winter season, heading into summer, get out on that patio asap. It is on the Scottsdale Waterfront, and they have misters and nice patio decor. Very relaxing, \"upscale\" feeling place.  Also, they do have a small market, with food available to go, made-to-order and wine  available. I might check that out for lunch one day. I'm always tempted to raid the market before I go home, but I haven't yet.  One thing that jades my experience evertyime I've been to O & I is the hostesses. They usually have a weird attitude, and it seems like they are doing you a favor by seating you.  Waiters/Waitresses are always great, and I love their style!   This is a great place to take family or go on a special day."}
{"text":"Sit on the patio. The ambiance is amazing. The food and drinks were good, but the sitting on the patio made the night. They had a live DJ who was one of the best I've heard in a while."}
{"text":"We had a really awesome time when we came in Friday night. We had a reservation but came early and they were flexible about seating us early. We ordered some drinks and an appetizer of Bacon Wrapped dates. Highly recommend the Pomegranate Daquiri and the Evangelista. We also ordered a bruschetta board with Manchego, Mishroom and Salmon Lox. The flavor combinations were unique (manchego and quince is quite tasty). We ordered the Atlantic salmon and the Sea scallops. I definitely loved the bread that came out along with the pesto. The bread was soft and chewy and the pesto had a good subtle tang. The scallops were perfectly cooked and the creamed corn and bacon combination you would think would be a heavy addition but I enjoyed every bite and was comfortably satisfied with the portion. The dessert is definitely the best with the Peanut butter mousse with chocolate crust (high recommendation). It's light and airy and the saltiness of peanut butter complemented the chocolate crust. Our waitress (Yvonne I believe was her name) was very attentive and gave great recommendations! I would highly recommend this restaurant :)"}
{"text":"Much needed lunch date with my good friend!  Olive and Ivy is always a great idea. The food is delicious - always consistent. The patio is very comfortable and I love the lights and trees.   My go to is  the bacon cheese burger & of course the bread and pesto . Jason was our server today. You should request him, he's very easy going and pleasant. He  provided great service and everything was wonderful.   I need to come here more often!  Wish they sold the bread and pesto in the market area!"}
{"text":"Awesome place even for vegetarians! I m a vegetarian who takes no egg, no meat, no fish. And this place served awesome pesto and bread :) we ordered flat bread - veg, bruschetta - veg. It was all great!! The waitress here are good too, she helped us make our choices.  Fine dine, with great ambience.  A must try place :)"}
{"text":"Overall great service I had 3 waiters come up to me and ask me if anyone had taken my order my food was delivered in a timely manner. I had the pasta which was pretty good it had slightly more lemon flavor that I would have liked but not too much where it was unbearable. Overall it was a good experience. Thanks Olive & Ivy"}
{"text":"My mom and I came here for first time and it was awesome! We walked in and got seated right away. Our waiter (Lonnie) came up immediately and got us some drinks. The space is good, decor is pretty & food is awesome! We got the cinnamon roll and hummus to start. The cinnamon roll tasted just as good as it smelled! It's hard to find a cinnamon roll with the perfect balance and this one definitely has it! The hummus had awesome, bold flavors. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and I have to say, it's one of the best I've ever had. My mom got the egg sandwich and that was just as good!  We'll definitely be coming back here again! One of the best experiences we've had and our waiter was amazing !"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times for lunch, happy hour and dinner. I love the atmosphere here --whatever time of day you decide to stop by.   My favorite thing is their calamari, the dipping sauce that comes with it is so good! The bacon wrapped dates are good too. I order scallops for my entree, very tasty but other than that, everything else is good but nothing stands out for me.   I recommend going on restaurant week so you can try a 3 course meal for a good price!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for Olive & Ivy, since we had heard such great things. We did have to wait 20 minutes even with a reservation, which was frustrating, but it may have been that they were trying to honor our patio request. Nevertheless, it was worth the wait! The patio was a gorgeous atmosphere! The waitress was friendly and went through the favorites on the menu. We ordered wine and bruschetta to start--quite good! We thought 3 bruschetta for $11 was a fair price. They also brought bread and pesto dipping sauce.  The food was very good. The leg of lamb was excellent, as was the chicken scallopini.  It was a relaxing meal, especially sitting out on the patio with the canal in the background.  Definitely make a reservation for weekend dinners, as it is always busy."}
{"text":"This place gets customer service! The little details make all the difference and they notice details.  The ambiance is energetic and rejuvenating and the concept is unique.  Love their food as well!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my Saturday evening at Olive & Ivy's outdoor patio.  Food, wine, location are ok to me.  I will definitely go back to this place and will enjoy wine and great food at outside patio."}
{"text":"Destination amazing. Our server Kelley made our whole dining experience extremely grand. He explained the lunch menu thoroughly. Not sure why- the food is grand but the menu is vague. The Red Sangria and Mojito are positively refreshing. Lasagna bolognese contains fresh made noodles. I watched the chef roll those delightful starchy chains right out of the machine. We are thrilled to have ended our Labor Day at this location. Without question we will be back and we will bring our friends. Nice break from the ordinary dining experience.  Atmosphere is beautiful and unique. Peanut butter mouse-fascinating-hard chocolate, light mouse and an airy powder."}
{"text":"Went tonight to celebrate my niece heading off to college, and my daughter's new promotion at work.  Got there early, and went to the bar for a drink. Bartenders were not very friendly, and ignored my order. Asked for a martini on the rocks with 3 olives, and got a straight up with 2 olives. (Didn't know how to make a martini)  never asked how I was doing, and if I needed anything else.  Food was delicious, and our server was very nice.  Overall had a great time, but will never sit at the bar again. Stayed with wine the rest of the night."}
{"text":"We've been here several times. The happy hour is great, $5 sangria, $3 bruchettas and $8 flat bread. And they're all pretty tasty."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant- it's one of my favs! The kid serving icecream in the grocery area is a total jerk though. Had I not been to olive & ivy before, and enjoyed my experience every single time previously, he would have truly put a damper on my experience. I let him know how rude he was & he suddenly told me that English was hard for him, since he was from Switzerland- when he had been speaking crystal clear (and perfectly rude) English up until then. Regardless, management should be aware of his Unprofessionalism and attitude."}
{"text":"I would come back here. Great food, cocktail, and beer menu. A bit pricey but the food was worth it. Excellent service and ambiance."}
{"text":"Although the address is on Camelback it really is south off Marshall Way. There is a free underground garage immediately North of the restaurant. Very large restaurant with a lot of outside seating  The pesto they bring out to start was outstanding (see photo) Antipasto was very good also. A lot of prosciutto (see photo) Atlantic salmon was excellent Spicy shrimp was not too spicy.  Fox Restaurants 1. Olive and Ivy (Scottsdale) 2. True Foods 3. North Italia (Phoenix) 4. The Henry 5.

{"text":"I love Olive and Ivy. It is a tried and true staple, always the first place I bring an out of town visitor.    The ambience inside is warm and charming, open and friendly, and classy.  I loove thier lighting it is just so inviting.  Tables are spaced nicely, the bar has great seating and not too packed in that area either.  You can order a meal at the bar without feeling like you're knocking elbows with the person next to you.  The outside of Olive and Ivy is my favorite though.  The social hour seating fills up QUICK - get there early.  There are comfy big chairs and couches right outside the waterfront.  It is my favorite sitting spot in all of scottsdale to eat drink and dine.  For food -- I've come here plenty, and here's my two cents. Skip the apps, share a salad with a friend, and enjoy an entree. I keep coming back to the veal ravioli, it is just heavenly and perfect.  There is arugula on top with a light cream sauce which isn't too heavy at all. I have to force myself to explore the menu because this dish is just so good.  Last time I was here I was trying to stick to my diet, I ordered the salmon and subbed spinach instead of thier regular side.  The dish was perfect, salmon was grilled to perfection, a real fresh piece of fish. It was generous too (more generous portion than the ravioli) - and I actually ended up taking some home. My mom ordered the Cioippino, which was flavorful, a generous portion, and very good also.  I also love their scallop entree.  I don't eat a ton of red meat, but I went with a friend one time who ordered the steak and pretty much devoured it.    As for drinks -- thier sangria is amaze! Stick with the red one.  Honestly I'm writing this right now, a warm February day in Arizona, and want to leave work to sit outside and eat my lunch in pure bliss at Olive and Ivy. I have a day off later this week and will make sure I stop by.  I simply cannot get enough of this place."}
{"text":"We were disappointed that we were unable to get outdoor seating but our waiter Easton made us overlook that part. We ordered drinks and bruschetta since we were walking around sampling different restaurants. Easton had personality, he was friendly and was very efficient. The bruschetta was delicious and the bread  and pesto that Easton brought out was tasty as well. Next time, I'm making reservations to sit outside."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and ambiance. The bruschettas were a pleasant surprise. Waiter was friendly, knowledgeable and quick."}
{"text":"Management staff is great, Jimmy Rowe is our absolute favorite!!! He is always so helpful and welcoming and makes our experience so incredible! -Ems & Libs & Ali!"}
{"text":"we happened upon Olive & Ivy while touring scottsdale yesterday, and needed a lunch spot quick (we love to eat, and when we get together, its basically an eating festival).  we took a look at the menu and decided to go for the cheaper option of the counter service were i got a $7 salad of mixed greens, two cherry tomatoes and an ice cream scoop of tuna.  it was okay. it did the trick.  my friend ate a curry chicken pita which looked excellent and which she enjoyed.    our server/cashier girl was very nice and suggested a drink that my friend tried and liked. and she was quick with the service, so all in all, a good experience. i wouldn't particularly call this place mediterranean, but it's definitely targeting rich people who care about having 8 different brands of bottled water to choose from."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch after morning rains so the patio was closed. They should switch entrances so the restaurant comes before the market. Kinda confusing for the first time visitor.  The restaurant itself is very nicely decorated with a classy feel.  It's a varied clientele: I noticed tables that could've been from the Golden Girls to Real Housewives of Scottdale to Teen Mom, AZ.  I thought the food, while good, was not anything spectacular. Portions were pretty small for the price and there was not much by way of presentation to match the tag.  My sangria seemed a bit diluted.  Our waiter was being trained so I'll pardon his awkwardness as he tried to repeat everything he was supposed to memorize multiple times. I'd come back on a cool day to try HH out on the patio to people watch, but probably not for brunch."}
{"text":"I had the traditional breakfast.  It was ok, nothing really great to say about the eggs, toast and potatoes.  Now after I finished I should have got the smoothie."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday for brunch and sat on the patio, it was comfortable and the misters felt great. Besides getting pooped on by a bird from the trees overhead, the pesto was yummy and bread was nice and soft. I ordered the Rosemary potato and soft egg flatbread that was delicious! My husband really liked his eggs benedict. My niece ordered the French toast and we all agreed that it really tasted like a jelly donut, In a good way! The Bloody Mary was fresh. I hope to go back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time when it first opened up but got spoiled with all the great dining in my area, central Phoenix and quit making the trip to Scottsdale.  So this past Sunday we decided to journey up to Scottsdale for Sunday brunch.  I notice that the dining area has become more formal than it used to be but the atmosphere and food are still fantastic.  Their peach bellini's are yummy and all the food super delicious!"}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy is always packed due to their delicious food, atmosphere, and great prices. The few times that I have been there the staff has always gone out of their way to accomodate my group of friends. I highly recommend the lasagna there!"}
{"text":"After receiving a very genuine response from Olive and Ivy, I clearly feel it's necessary to update my review I wrote when I was 'hangry' (hungry and angry).   Apparently I just need to request a certain amount of focaccia, though I truly don't need more than one piece (maybe they were just trying to prevent me from binge eating? If so, you guys are very thoughtful). I do know that in the past they were much more generous with their servings, so I was kind of hoping they would assume if I'm ordering it, that I definitely would love as much as possible ;-)   I realize I sound like a lunatic ranting about this, but just think of this bread and pesto as a drug (because it's truly addictive) and I clearly need my fix...haha  Moral of the story: their bread and pesto is so good that some people will actually freak out if they aren't given more than one serving :-) (or maybe that's just me...)"}
{"text":"The sweet potato cannelloni is to die for. Everything about this place is so amazing. The wait is always long but for good reason. So make reservations!"}
{"text":"The mozzarella bruschetta and Lamb meatballs were both very tastey. The dark chocolate creme brulle was an excellent finish.  The gem of this restaurant for me was the ambience out on the outside couches. I relaxed there for over an hour people watching and enjoying the April weather in Phx."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch, beautiful day and smart service! The focaccia pesto with a Bloody Mary chaser is a delightful start. The bird calls in the courtyard patio are annoying."}
{"text":"I don't really know how to start with my review of Olive & Ivy, this place is special to me because it's been where I have celebrated my friends engagement, where I rang in 2014, where I went with friends for lunch and for an outdoor brunch or two during the beautiful Arizona days. The atmosphere is spot on, the patio is fabulous and all in all they have the perfect set up here, oh and the food and drink is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is really a beautiful restaurant. Beautiful views of the canal and patio lights. We were seated nexted to the window by the door and it was cold. We asked to be moved to another table and it was still cold. My husband had a sweater over a shirt and I had a thick cardigan. But we were determined to have a nice dinner. It was my birthday and our first time here. We ordered the sangria and artichoke appetizer. Which is a salad and very good. Artichoke hearts and baby field greens, light balsamic dressing. We thought it was a little strange we had to tell the waiter we were ready to order at this point. We were left a time waiting for our food.  Also the music was blaring to the point I wished I was sitting on the patio. Which had heaters at every table. I ordered half a beet salad, delicious. And the Bass with caramelized cauliflower. Also very good. My husband had lasagna and he said it was delicious. I would like to come back and eat on the beautiful patio next time. But my husband pretty much has crossed this restaurant off his list. We both agreed their food was delicious."}
{"text":"I really really really enjoy all of the 90. Every time I go to Phoenix I stop by this restaurant and have their amazing bruschetta, Seabass, or steak dinners. The last time we went our waitress was very accommodating and allowed us to split multiple plates. My friend and I enjoyed our surf and turf meal and also enjoyed the bruschetta.  The atmosphere and the Decour were very appealing to me and my coworkers. We are going to continue to come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good little resturant in terminal 4, gate A. Line goes quick and while waiting you can choose your drinks in a refrigerator (not just soda; they have coconut waters, water, and others).   The menu is great!!!. Paninis, salads, pizza I think and all amazing choices to choose. I'm a vegetarian, so having those chooses on the menu immediately gives me their vote. The menu is not extravagant, which is good for a person traveling.   Also, great java choices if your not looking for food !!! Mmmmm"}
{"text":"One of my favorite fox concepts.  Great open air restaurant and outside seating area.  The pesto with bread appetizer is really good, brunch is best here and the breakfast sandwich is off the hook.  The mushroom flat bread with truffle oil is my favorite thing at olive and ivy and service was good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! You can't go wrong with Fox restaurants. The chefs really know how to pair ingredients well and the dishes are so unique.  We went there to celebrate our anniversary and our server treated us to dessert   You just can't beat free food   Not only was the food and our server amazing but the atmosphere there is always fun and cheery! Highly recommend the scallops!"}
{"text":"I'm literally SO obsessed!!   I went there by chance on a Saturday and I had the tomato and spinach flatbread. Oh my gosh it was so good! The bread was all made fresh so the cheese just melted all over it. The staff is so sweet and friendly. The first time one of my girlfriend's and I went there we were so impressed at how sweet ( and cute ) all the waiters were... ;)  The next day we went there at 7am for breakfast and yet again the breakfast was to die for. We both had an egg and avocado kinda sandwich.  For lunch you have to try the simple green salad. I believe it was only $5 or so and it was SO BIG!   But for sure when you go you have to have to have to get the vanilla latte.. I have no idea why it is but its the best I've ever had!   Last but not least.. the atmosphere is so beautiful. The patio is amazing( fountain and trees and birds), and the inside seating is so cozy.   I feel like Im at a french cafe for breakfast but at lunch/diner I feel like I'm in Italy eating the best flatbread ever.  Must try for sure especially if you live in Scottsdale Waterfront.. just right across the street! :)"}
{"text":"Josh and Conrad were awesome at Olive and Ivy tonight! It was our first time at this restaurant and it was awesome in every way! Thanks for the great first of many visits!!"}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite Fox Foods Chain of Restraunts. The atmosphere is lively. Food is consistently good and they are very accomodating for food allergies. Drinks were very good and the gelato is even better.  OLIVE & IVY has a beautiful out door cafe area whether your dressed casual or putting on the Ritz you will feel comfortable. They also have a quick grab and go Bistro area  if you are in the mood for coffee latte and pastry.You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Super cool ambience! Noise level pretty high so not great for a quiet, romantic dinner. Food was good as well as the service. Kitchen made a mistake on one of the entrees and immediately credited our bill. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We usually end up here for breakfast, and they have always done a good job.  It's a small menu, but there is something for everyone.  If you want a Bloody Mary or mimosa, they can help you out.  If you're in recovery mode, the cafe has some Gatorade and other options.  The patio is beautiful, and I highly recommend getting a table there unless it's too hot outside."}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy offers a creative and exciting menu.  I have tried many of the items and have been pleased with all of them.  The food is fresh, the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable and the prices off a good value.  The location I decent as long as it is not during the holiday season (too much shopping traffic!).    The only thing that would make this a better rating from my perspective is the acoustics.  It can be very noisy and difficult to hear the people you are dining with.  Other than that, love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We got to the restaurant early but we could not be saeted for one hour . There is a beautiful lounge next to the waterfront.thecwaitress was attentive but it was cold wecrequested that the  heater get turned on but itvran out of gas. The fish we ordered was good but portion was small I had to order extra bread to get filled up. The c italian soup I ordered eas good but look warm. I akso tried their lasagna better portion but wery salty. The service was good at all times"}
{"text":"My favorite new Restaurant! My server Josh was phenomenal...best service ever great recommendations..,the food was so fresh and amazing!! Get the Chicken Chopped Salad with the Peanut Granola so so good!  I will definitely be back when I'm in town and will recommend olive and ivy to anyone who's visiting Scottsdale for the best food and awesome service from Josh!!!!   Also sit on the patio, what a beautiful atmosphere - I felt like I was in France!  I can't wait to come back to eat here again!"}
{"text":"I have dined here many times, and would highly recommend it.  The prices are great, the staff is friendly, and the food is amazing; I have never been served a meal that I didn't enjoy!  Overall great food, staff, prices, location, and atmosphere, please try it and you will be a regular like me in no time!"}
{"text":"If you'd like to go on a date to be insulted by a group of hostesses, this is the place!  Rude, snobby and pretentious!  A friend recommended the place for a date night but these ladies were less than inviting upon entry and suggested we eat in the lounge area because we didn't have a reservation at 6 on a Thursday night.  We went to the area and there was nowhere to sit.  We had to come back in to yet another rude hostess, \"you don't have a reservation or a name you left?\", uh no we were here two seconds when you pointed us to the lounge to eat dinner!  I would not ever recommend this place even though the food was ok and server was better then the hostesses, the negative over made up ladies up front made it so awful!"}
{"text":"If you're hear for the food you'll be taken care of but I gotta tell you that the bar area has some of the worst service.  This is the 2nd time I went in here to have a drink and both times the bartenders didn't seem aware of their customers.  I finally had to flag one down just for a drink. .this place is worth going back to however I'll skip the bar next time."}
{"text":"The vibe of this restaurant is definitely worth coming back for. They had a live DJ, great happy smiling service, and of course being on the Scottsdale waterfront is a plus too.   I came here with a reservation of 8. We were 30 minutes late but when we called to let them know, they were super understanding and held the table for us even though the restaurant was very busy. All food comes with unlimited bread and pesto, but you can ask for olive and vinegar too - so yummy.   I ordered the wild mushroom pappardelle because my server had recommended it. It was somewhat bland and the noodles were hard to eat, but my boyfriend ordered the chicken scallopini with mashed potatoes and that was delicious. Two of my friends ordered their bruschetta (3 for $13) but looking at the portions/toppings/prices, I'd much prefer going to postino for that instead.   Overall it was a nice experience. Nothing on the menu really stuck out to me, but the restaurant environment made up for that."}
{"text":"Superb simple sandwiches with FLAVOR. I was very impressed. The roast beef sandwich is to die for - the beef is shaved extra thin, bread is toasty. I was pleasantly surprised overall."}
{"text":"WOW!    Yesterday was my birthday and my husband told me to pick a place to go for dinner. I wanted to go somewhere that was different, that wasn't too fancy, but was also a little more upscale.  I remembered that I was sent a coupon for a free desert at any Fox Concepts Restaurants.  I was really ping-ponging between Olive & Ivy and another restaurant in Phoenix.  I'm glad that I picked Olive & Ivy because I was so impressed and the food was AMAZING!    This place has an awesome atmosphere. They had a live DJ, their windows/doors were open. It's really a \"grand\" space. The menu is fairly simple, which I understand changes fairly often.  I ordered the sea scallops with polenta and my husband had a salad. I was amazed at how yummy my dish was. (I've never had polenta before so I hope it all tastes like this one!) My husbands salad looked really good too, I even had to have a few bites.  After dinner I ordered the lemon pudding cake. Oh. Em. Gee!  The cake was so light and fluffy and just amazing.    I have to checkout the other restaurant that I decided against next!!!"}
{"text":"It took us awhile to get back but we did and brought out of town guests. On another hot day the patio was comfortable. We had an excellent waiter. It was brunch again. I enjoyed my flatbread. My wife enjoyed her burger. One guest enjoyed her eggs Benedict. Another enjoyed her kale salad. The peanut butter mouse was great and the lemon gelato was too we were told.  We should return more often."}
{"text":"I love Olive and ivy marketplace. Great place to hang outside and have a coffee during the day or hang out at night and have gelato. The breakfast at the marketplace is very good. I usually build my own omelette."}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy is a trendy Scottsdale spot with tasty food, loud music and good service. The atmosphere is pretty cool - large bar up front, huge open patio and cool lanterns hanging over head. It's a bit deceiving if you enter through the dessert bar area because it looks like a little grocery store - it's definitely not.   The food tasted great and was presented nicely without being ridiculously pricey. I didn't have any ice cream, but it looked really tasty. The service was very good and the drinks were delish (try a raspberry mojito - mmm). We went in on a Friday night without reservations and had to wait a solid 1.5 hours - make reservations.   This is a great spot if you like to be surrounded by 30-something hipsters or older men and women trying to be hip. I liked that the tables weren't piled on top of each other, but it was still crowded. There was a pretty good vibe -- I'd definitely go back next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy is such a find in the Phx airport. Great prices ($4.00 for a glass of decent Chard), good food, super friendly staff, cool music and outlets under every seat...made for a pleasant 2 hour wait."}
{"text":"Nice place and very friendly staff. The girl taking my order was really helpful and sweet"}
{"text":"I came here with HIGH expectations. Just being honest! Many people have raved about this place-so I was expecting a GREAT food experience.  I waited for a friend at the bar. My Desert Blossom cocktail was pretty good. I would def order again. My friend was a tad late, so they gave away my reservation. Atleast they were nice about it, and seated us 6 minutes later. We were seated close to the open kitchen, service was good. I just didn't feel the food was so outstanding. The food arrived almost immediately, which in a way is good, but really makes me wonder if it was freshly made.  I think part of the issue is that sitting outdoors when it gets dark adds to the ambience, magical twinkling lights. I didn't feel the seating inside really had great ambience, so I might give this place another try in the fall.  Our fritto mist was OK, not great. My salad was great, but def not the best meditteranean salad i have ever had. Artichokes.. OK.....  I'll put this one on my back up list to try again."}
{"text":"This place is all around great! Atmosphere, food and service! I've been coming here for many years and never have been disappointed! Great for date night, girls night dinner and happy hour!"}
{"text":"We ordered the scallops and loved them so much we went back for a second round.  We also ordered the butchers block , one night was better than the other so I would like to see some consistency with that . We also ordered bacon wrapped dates, they were good but not amazing and we loved the lamb meatballs and  enjoyed desert, peanut butter mousse."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to eat!! I had company on town and we took them to olive and ivy for brunch. I had the garden flat bread and it was amazing!! My husband had the best tuna salad sandwich we have ever had!!  My guests had a Mediterranean salad which I did sneak a taste of and loved.  Our server Courtney was wonderful! I will Absoutly be back!!  Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Always a fun place to visit!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The food is good, reasonable priced and they have great ambiance. The servers and hostesses are super friendly and helpful. I got the lamb gryo with a side salad and it was good. i was stuffed for the day! They also are really nice to my crazy 1 and 2 year old kids. Most restaurants are not accommodating but they were and i appreciate that."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday and was not let down. We had such a great time. Amazing service!!! It was so cozy and inviting, but still elegant. Thanks for making my birthday that much better!"}
{"text":"Last minute real for 15 and they were able to accommodate us in a really nice private room. Very pretty decor and the service was on point. Food was good and very reasonable. Liked the sea bass and the flat bread. Must get the lemon tres leche cake!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big happy hour fan and the only time I have  to make it in that window is during vacation. From 4-6pm, Olive and Ivy has $5 wine/drink specials and a small plates menu. If you happen to be there, please try the Asparagus and Wild Mushroom flatbread with truffle oil and the Italian Sausage Polenta.  To this day, I am still  dreaming about it.  As it is in the waterfront area of Scottsdale, the restaurant decor is absolutely beautiful. No matter where you sit inside a hundred hanging lamps looking at bottles of wine or the bright green outdoor space with a fountain, sipping a glass of Cab in your hands, you will feel like a million bucks! I gave it 5 stars for their bang for the buck happy hour, $25 between 2 people is a winner to me. Perfect place to end my January vacation, especially knowing I have to return to the frozen tundra or as most folks know it to be as Chicago."}
{"text":"The best dinner, fabulous deserts, awesome atmosphere and Daniel is soooooo adorable!  Best server I have had in my life!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best pork dishes ever. My wife's ribeye was outstanding. All the food was top shelf. My favorite in Phoenix will go back next time I'm in town.  A little noisy but everything else was so good."}
{"text":"Busy lunch time crowd, noisy. Great menu & interesting coctails. Gyro was tasty, but lacked authenticity. Chopped chicken salad was very good but not remarkable. Service was good for how busy they were. The real treat was sitting @ chef's table and watching the intricate workings of the busy kitchen. Tickets spitting out in 3 feet ribbons, dealt out like cards to the staff & then reassembled as meals."}
{"text":"Excellent place and came highly recommended by the hotel staff. Our waitress, Micki was amazing and knew what to suggest based on our questions. The food (sea bass) and ambiance were great too."}
{"text":"They really knock it out of the park here. Every plate is a slide into home plate. From the chicken to the vegetarian options, you can't go wrong!  The restaurant itself is gorgeous. They have dangling lights from the ceiling. A true piece of art. On weekend nights they often have a DJ and on weeknights the area around the restaurant has events going on that are nice to walk off after dinner.   If you want a cocktail, I highly recommend the red sangria. It is out of this world. The dirty martinis are also a notable choice.   The service is just as fantastic as the food.   If you're not in the mood for a sit down meal, they also have a café/deli area that you can pop into for a quick to-go order if need be."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to Olive & Ivy for the few times that I've been here. Be sure to try their complimentary bread with pesto sauce! The pesto sauce that they use is fresh and is amazing. So far for lunch I've had the Margherita flatbread and the Turkey Grinder sandwich, both were excellent. Prices are very reasonable as well considering the quality and effort that they put into their food.  The atmosphere is great as well and I loved the interior decor."}
{"text":"We came here in February, so the outdoor patio was lovely. The service was decent but a little slow. The appetizers were good - we especially enjoyed the brushetta selection and the bacon-wrapped dates. The lamb meatballs were pretty bland and tasteless though. We were with a large group so there were a variety of things ordered. However, I ordered the tuna and it was too salty. I didn't enjoy the flavor at all. My husband ordered the gnocchi, and while it was pretty tasty (although a little too rich for me) - it was a TINY portion and he ended up finishing up the bread to have a whole meal. For the price, the general consensus was that most meals were too small. Someone else had the chicken though, and that was good. The desserts were good overall, but again not great. Most of us had a scoop of sorbet, and for the price ($1.75) that seemed a good deal and just enough to finish the meal. The table also ordered the ice cream bar and while it was tasty it was also rock-hard and difficult to cut even with the steak knife they provided. Overall this place is decent but I would imagine that Scottsdale has better options."}
{"text":"Here's a tip that could improve your experience. The restaurant is very loud inside but the patio has a great ambiance. Try to eat on the canal patio!"}
{"text":"This is a trendy restaurant. Food is ok not great, especially for the prices charged. We did have a friendly server and I always appreciate that. Lunch menu is very limited compared to the dinner menu. I would only go back for dinner."}
{"text":"I love their brunch and their dinner! The food is so flavorful and delicious. Most recently I had their watermelon salad, which was so refreshing for the beginning of spring in Phoenix. I love the location on the waterfront, which can be enjoyed from their large, shaded patio."}
{"text":"We were in town for the weekend for the Rock-n-Roll marathon, wanted a relaxing (good energy) outdoor restaurant with amazing food, and we found exactly that, it was so amazing that we had gone back 3X, twice for dinner and once for lunch on this same trip.  My favorite meal was the kale salad with caramelized pecans, bleu cheese, chopped bacon, mixed with a zesty orange/balsamic vinaigrette dressing --I added chicken the first night and ahi tuna the second night. Its a MUST have. The cannelloni with mushrooms were tasty, a bit too heavy and creamy on the sauce and the bruschettas (on the appetizer menu) were also on the top list.  The wait staff are super friendly, I couldn't forget to mention the female manager that helped us out immensely as we were in dire need of charging our iphone, she was professional and so accommodating. Thank you so very much.   I work in the service industry and appreciate a nice meal with good service and this was by far my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I am thrilled Olive & Ivy is in the airport.  Delicious breakfasts, friendly staff, and good coffee drinks.  Beats the hell out of Burger King.  That stuff will kill ya."}
{"text":"Today I had a lunch meeting at Olive and Ivy. The atmosphere is fun and open. It was not too crowded but busy which is always a good sign.  We sat up at the bar to enjoy the taller seats and watch the world go by.  Our server / bar tender did an excellent job and I would return just to set in her section again.  I had the flat bread!  I would recommend this to anyone as it was loaded with flavor. Their opener of fresh bread and pesto is to die for ... I had a lot of carbs but it was all in the name of good food and of course business.  I look forward to my next visit.  This is another one of the Fox Restaurant Concepts and they are always a fine place to eat!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here at Olive and Ivy. The service, food and atmosphere was amazing. The food was so good hard to put into words. Next time in town will be dropping in for more great food."}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy really impressed me. As I read the lower reviews and scan the pictures, I understand why my experience was so different.   I was here for a dinner celebration, but we didn't order any flatbreads or sandwiches. Instead, we had a wine and dine experience.   Rib eye - medium rare - perfectly cooked and seasoned with crisp oven potatoes. Big eye tuna - seared only - with leeks and roasted mushrooms. Pork tenderloin - wrapped in bacon. Free range chicken - with English peas and a citrus sauce. Beet salad Fresh mozzarella Fig and prosciutto bruschetta  Everything was decadent and delicious. Good wine selection, I had the Albarino.  Waiters were young and handsome; service was on point. Open kitchen, bodega aisle, and waterfront seating option. Prices were shockingly low for a beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"First off, I've got to say that the location and decor of this place is awesome. Great job by whoever is responsible for that. This is a great place for a date, or for brunch with friends on the weekends. The food is excellent and the service is outstanding. I would go more often, but it is a little on the pricy side... but well worth it."}
{"text":"I had a fabulous lunch here on the patio with a girlfriend last week. The weather is FINALLY perfect and their patio is one of the best in the Valley! I could eat their complimentary pesto + bread for my meal and be totally satisfied. YUM! Their Mediterranean Salad with chicken is my FAVORITE! I also recommend the funghi, roasted brussels sprout, and butternut squash bruschetta. Everything is so fresh and delicious. I will absolutely be back soon. Even just for a drink on their gorgeous patio, it is worth the visit. This is also a great place to bring out of town guests so that they can get a good feel of the Scottsdale vibe!"}
{"text":"All Style, No Substance...  For all the hype about Olive & Ivy, the food doesn't measure up.  Not sure where the 5 star reviews come from.... not the food for me, nor the service which alternated between crabbiness and nervous hovering. Our patio server didn't want to transfer our check despite the fact we never even received our drinks on the patio before being seated in the restaurant. Our dining room server lingered by our table incessantly, seeming to not know when to approach or interrupt us.   The food was... eh. Although the scallops were cooked perfectly, they had zero flavor.  The spinach was bland and pointless: not cooked, not raw, with some flavorless broth just splashed over. Could that possibly be the sherry syrup? The dish boasted wild mushrooms (two) and crisp pancetta. Is that what those three tiny chunks were? The lemon aceto on the halibut was excruciating. The tuna tartare was absolutely flavorless. Where was the Red Chile Aioli? The pesto flatbread was perhaps the most edible thing of the evening. The affogatto dessert was described as Vanilla Gelato, Stream Lined Espresso and Kahlua Cream. I didn't mind the puddle of espresso with vanilla ice cream melting in the middle but the unsweetened cream on top...? ick. Where was the Kahlua?  Sangria was tasty, but despite paying for a $6.00 large Pellegrino, it disappeared from my table and I only received half a refill. I only drank 1/4 of the bottle, wherever it was.   Cougar alert!!!  Olive & Ivy remains open for its feverish cougar bar scene and patio. It's a shame that the food doesn't merit the incredible building it is served in."}
{"text":"I must hand it to them at Olive and Ivy! First rate atmosphere and food. The pesto is the most flavorful I have ever had and that includes pesto I have eaten in Italy. Wine selection is terrific. The breakfast, lunch and dinners are wonderful. The bar feels a bit like a meat market but that is the only down side. It is beautiful, clean and worth returning to again and again."}
{"text":"Delicious! Scallops for dinner were amazing and gelato is to die for especially at that price!"}
{"text":"Lve!!!   The patio is awesome. Occassionally the wind blows and the Waterfront doesn't produce the best of smells ... but the ambiance on the patio more than makes up for it. The wine was amazing, the mediterranean flatbread was awesome, we tried some of the bruschettas that were great. I really love the vibe inside too. We were there on a Sat night and the DJ kicked it up a notch but was not overpowering at all.   I'll def be back!"}
{"text":"Although the  food reviews may be stellar, I could just not eat here.    I am not sure what Olive and Ivory wants to be - a restaurant  or  dance club - What I experienced was mor  like a dance club for foodies than an actual restaurant.   I could not hear a word the table server was saying about the menu, and I could not see the menu without a small torch lamp .  What I could read on the menu were not meals , but , rather , experiments in fusions of various traditional world foods.  Good if your into tapas type dining.  This place looked and felt like a snooty pick-up spot devoid of any real sustenance."}
{"text":"I came for the ambience but walked away with so much more.. I did not make reservation for the patio seating but my guest and I still got great table near the patio inside. FYI.. They do have open community seating on the patio if you do not mind sharing your area.   We got the chef's board with wine..It was the perfect way to end long work week and catch up. The variety of different meats/cheeses with nuts were perfect! I was pleasantly surprised by the soft spread cheese drizzled with olive oil, great compliment to hard crusted bread on the board.   If your in the mood for desert they have gelato flavors that will make you want to cheat on your diet!   Lastly they turn on music after 7ish and lower the lights perfect atmosphere to relax and enjoy dinner.."}
{"text":"We came and ate in the cafe. The gentleman behind the counter was extremely friendly and helpful. The food was delicious. I had the turkey grinder with a fresh lemonade. My friends got the tuna and grilled cheese. The restaurant is supposed to be very good as well, but is more for someone who wants to sit down and have a nice meal. For a quick and yummy lunch, the cafe is perfect."}
{"text":"What a great surprise. The inside can accommodate a lot of people and yet its not noisy inside. The wait staff was very helpful and had good suggestions. Food was great - its hard deciding what to order.  Get there early because it really fills up as the evening goes on.  Great for dates, large parties or families"}
{"text":"So your first class flight lands. You go to check into your hotel. You go back out to explore the town and do a little shopping and you find yourself hungry again. What do you do? You go to Olive & Ivy of course!   Wow, the food is scrumptious and the atmosphere is so refreshing, clean and modern. As you walk into the entrance you will be cascaded with a very light mist of H2O. Oooh, dramatics honey. It's mainly because this is Arizona and the dry heat can get a bit irritating in the summer. So I think that's a nice gesture for businesses in this area. We walked up to hostess stand and let me tell you chile. All of the hostesses looked like Victoria Secret models. Wow. Just over the top beautiful, honey. Is this common at Olive & Ivy? Because if it is, please don't fire the hiring manager. Lol. Anyways, one of the Sports Illustrated lookalikes escorted us to the bar and we were greeted by one of the  bartenders that suggested I try the Mediterranean salad (a must order) with added shrimp. I also gulped down a few tasty cocktails. I can't remember the name of them :( but honestly you can't go wrong with any of the drinks you try at the bar.   My salad was fulfilling and flavorful the added shrimp big and juicy.   Breakfast is suppose to be really good here as well. I will have to try it out for myself.  This place is gold and I will be back."}
{"text":"Seriously love this restaurant.  The bread they bring you with the basil pesto is amazing!  I could make a meal of that alone!  Great cocktails that offer combinations of liquors you wouldn't expect but they taste delicious. Their small plates are so uniquely done and meld such awesome flavors with the freshest ingredients.  The salads are some of the best I've experienced and the flatbreads are delicious as well.  The huge outdoor patio is so tastefully done - you feel like you are at your own comfortable outdoor abode.  I have to give a shout out to Tommy, our waiter on 10/28/14 who was the BEST!  He said he was going to \"take care of us and feed us\" and with his suggestions and help with choosing our small plates - he hit a home run!  His sensational personality and wit were all it took to send our memorable evening over the top.  Been patronizing this place ever since I first learned of it several years ago and hope to be for a long time to come."}
{"text":"Went here for my causin Travis graduation dinner with the family from California. We were served by Tommy. He was absolutely fantastic and took care of us so well. We will definitely be referring this place to all of our friends and family after the amazing service we received. Thank you Tommy for the great, friendly and perfect service!!!"}
{"text":"I have many had many great dining experiences at Olive & Ivy. The lamb meatballs and sea scallops are amazing! Wait staff is friendly and attentive. This is defiantly one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"bahahahaha I love the comment about the cougars. My friend and I had the exact same observation.   I have been twice, the first time was the best. we had the perfect spot on the patio. We ordered one of their pizzas (really tasty) and the hummus (decent). It was nice to just enjoy the atmosphere and the food. We split so it wasn't very costly and was the perfect portion.  The 2nd time it was bit more costly and not really worth it. I had the bacon wrapped pork (really yum) and my friend ordered the scallops (he said they were too salty and not worth the money).  So, basically, my review is eat here when you want a great patio and view and split an appetizer and course. otherwise, it's not really worth the money."}
{"text":"A few of my girlfriends and I stopped here before a night out. Can't think of 1 thing they need to improve. Great atmosphere, drinks, service, ambiance and music. Looking forward to returning. If you like going out and enjoy a classier crowd, this is thee spot in old town you should check out."}
{"text":"Our waiter was great.  Wiped any crumb off the table, very polite, no complaints there.  This place is loud!  We went for anniversary celebration.  I felt like we were in a night club.  i think they are trying to be a hip place to appeal to 20's crowd.  Food was okay, very pricey and no value. We had chicken dish and lasagna dish.  The lasagna was a very small 17.00 served in a bowl .  Not impressed.  I make better lasagna.  My chicken dish was the natural chicken.  It was good but once again not impressive for 19.00 they charged for it.  Small portions with big prices.  Loud atmosphere.  I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Took the opportunity on this past perfect May weekend to use my Fox gift certificate and find a table outside. Bring on the O&I.   With a nod to the other yelpers, I was cautiously optimistic about the Scottsdale vibe [you know, are your boobs/car/jewelry big enough] enough to go with the Lovely. It was early and we had a reservation in which I had requested the patio. We drove up and although a bit put off by the $6 valet - um, really? used it nonetheless.   Seated right as we walked in, on the patio. Lovely night, perfect setting. Except for the choice of music - it seemed weird. I'm sorry, 'Play that Funky Music'?? With your filet and tempranillo? Not so much. Service was spot on, and actually a bit too 'on' I don't think its great to clear my plate when my dinner mate is still eating...just sayin'.   As others have noted, pesto and bread to die for. i tried the prosciutto and fig bruschetta which was yummy [not as good as Postino...] and Jeff had the margherita flatbread. Really fresh and light. He had the tenderloin, I had the tuna. Both scrumptious, lightly sauced and cooked to perfection. Dessert was a shared nutella pudding. Lovely unctuous pudding and whipped cream topped with roasted hazelnuts. Music to my tastebuds. Lovely texture and flavor. Wonderful coffee as well.   Nice wine list, very good cocktails and an atmosphere at least outdoors that was fab. Did i sound whiney? Dont mind me. Go, it'll be well worth it."}
{"text":"With 500+ Reviews, Most of all it has been said but I will offer this: Fox Concepts Restaurants consistently pulls off a memorable, pleasant experience that is tasty, full of quality and will, occasionally, have a memorable service experience.   All restaurants have their ups & downs, but Olive & Ivy is consistently good, innovative and the atmosphere is quite nice; inside or outside. Drinks are tasty, Scallopini and Cannelloni are both just Yum!  Never had a bad experience here.  Overall Rating: 4.5 Stars Service: 4.1 Stars Food: 4.6 Stars  Quality: 4.5 Stars Cleanliness: 4.2 Stars Value: 3.9 Stars"}
{"text":"Unimpressed. Service was poor (except the girl who fixed my order). They put mayonnaise on my sandwich after I explicitly made it clear that I would follow her to the depths of the earth and make her pay if she even so much thought about putting the most disgusting ingredient known to mankind on my food.   Thankfully server #2 fixed my order when she realized I was waiting for someone to fix my order after three workers completely dismissed me despite the fact that it's not difficult to tell that I have a very impatient look on  my face and I am trying to enjoy something on my ay to freaking St .Louis, MO.   But even after they fixed my order, I had to shovel it down my throat in less chews than it takes John Goodman to eat Top Ramen (does that make any sense?)  Either way, I should have stood by my own established rule:  Airport bar = good  Airport restaurant = booty.   YOU PUT MAYO ON MY SANDWICH!! I SHOULD BE PERMITTED, BY LAW, TO CANE YOU."}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy Marketplace is a great place for lunch in the Phoenix Airport...  It is quick, tasty & has good prices!  We had a Greek salad with extra Avocado and a special order veggie sandwich.  The salad was large, fresh and delicious . The sandwich was a panini toasted to a golden tan and stuffed full of delicious, fresh vegetables .  On my return flight I plan to eat here again. It has pizza, wraps, salads and Mediterranean ... and delicious fresh baked muffins and cookies."}
{"text":"We really wanted to check this place out.  Went around 6pm on a Monday and were seated quickly.  Our server, Rachel, was phenomenal.  She was well-versed in the menu and knew a lot about the other Fox concept locations.  We had the lamb meatballs, lasagna and chicken scallopini.  My only gripe is that there was probably too much breading on the chicken, but overall it was very good.  Especially the sauce on the chicken.  It seemed to be a little busy with several 6-top tables all around.  Prices were reasonable and I was definitely full.  I'd come back to this place and try other menu items.  Pros=service, food quality, ambiance, proximity to other restaurants Cons=hard to find on my TomTom and iPhone maps apps.  Plus, I think I went in the wrong door (the marketplace) and some randoms asked if they could help me.  Not sure if they worked there or not."}
{"text":"Who put the pistachio's in the Beet Salad?  .... They are a genius!  We hit up Olive and Ivy for restaurant week on Saturday and we were more than pleased with entire experience.  They were pretty full so we took an early reservation for 5:45.  Starting at the bar, we enjoyed some  1/2 price drinks during Happy Hour.  The Pomegranate Martini is very tasty, and surprisingly not very sweet.   Once we got sat, everything at the table was spectacular starting with the hummus, then the sweet potato cannelloni and finishing with the coffee crème brulee.   I couldn't ask for a better meal.  The table agreed that the sweet potato was one of the best things they have ever eaten, it's a must!  I was in vegetarian heaven.   It was still a little hot to sit outside, but once fall kicks in, their patio at night is a romantic spot to grab a bite and enjoy some wine."}
{"text":"Went by this place after having dinner at a nearby restaurant and doing a short strolls. Very busy but the patio caught my eye. Told my husband \"let's come here for breakfast tomorrow.\" Always want to try as many restaurants when visiting a new place as possible.   Good choice. Sat on the awesome patio, quiet yet nice ambience. Our waiter was funny, timely and polite. My French toast was to die for.  Regular French toast then sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon served with berry compote. Didn't even use the maple syrup.  Loved it."}
{"text":"We dined there the other night and absolutely loved our experience. Their food was delicious and the service fantastic. The perfect ambiance for a relaxing and fun meal. Their menu also clearly marks which items are gluten free which was very helpful. We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Friday night with a girlfriend when we were visiting from out of town.  We had a res outside and when they went to seat us, someone had mistakenly sat at our seats so we had to stand around and wait less than 5 min.  Shared the sangria to start.  We then had small portions of both the beet and mediterranean salad.  Both were excellent.  I had the mushroom tortellini and my friend a seafood dish - scallops maybe?  The food was all amazing and Robert, our server, was a sweetheart.  We then asked where we could find some fruit to buy to eat before our hike in the morning.  They actually brought us a bag of fruit on them because we had to wait a few minutes for our table, after already getting a sincere apology. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"The food was good. The service seemed to be a bit snobby. Food came quickly. We ordered 1 salad and 1 flat bread but got 2 salads. Neither of us were starved so we felt this would be plenty. Again that was the waiters fault for not paying close enough attention to the details. There are plenty of other hip places in old town to consider"}
{"text":"Pleasant breakfast meeting. Good coffee; very good wait staff. Entree was OK - very limited meeting menu. Previous experience has convinced me that their food is better than acceptable"}
{"text":"Have been to Olive & Ivy in small and large group settings for brunch, happy hour, and dinner with consistently good experiences. We had my Stepmom's surprise 60th birthday party here--the event space was easy to book--our event space was indoor/outdoor with great views of the Waterfront canal."}
{"text":"First things first, I was skeptical to try another Fox restaurant while on my Arizona trip, especially after my awful experience at arrogant butcher. But I'm so glad that I did. I visited the restaurant during happy hour and was able to get a seat at the bar with no trouble at all. The servers are extremely friendly and the food was really good.   Their complimentary pesto and bread was so good and the pesto had so much flavor. I tried the salmon lox bruschetta which was recommended and I'm so glad I did, it was so tasty and just the perfect amount. I also tried their Margherita flatbread which was so simple yet so perfect. I'm so glad that I decided to give this restaurant a shot and if you're in the area I definitely would recommend going here. Not to mention their happy hour is legit."}
{"text":"Here is my 10 year olds commentary   Loved the lamb meatballs and Brussel sprout bruschetta. When I got my pasta,they tried to hard to make the pasta healthier. I love pasta but it should be authentic."}
{"text":"Whenever I have a friend in from out of town I take them here. Visually the restaurant is really attractive and feels comfortable. The people watching is fun and it's near fantastic shopping. Anything I've ever ordered here has been really great.  The 'cafe' in the front is good too, if you're in a hurry...even for breakfast."}
{"text":"Love the chicken walnut salad and they can make a better latte than the peets down the terminal.   Right though,  I treated myself to their super yummy snickerdoodle cookie.  Perfect pick me up before a redeye flight."}
{"text":"The vibe, drinks, and service were all incredible. The drinks here might have been the best I have ever had at a brunch. Phenomenal Bloody Mary (I had two! It could have used more fun stuff in it, but the taste was amazing, spicy but not too spicy, and just went down really smoothly) and my friend had a Paloma which was also delicious (great recommendation by the waitress).   The cinnamon roll was huge and cheap and delicious! I wish I had ordered something other than the Eggs Benedict (definitely did not live up to everything else at the meal), but I still really enjoyed the overall experience at Olive and Ivy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in all of Scottsdale. The sweet potato cannelloni is perfect. The food is very flavorful yet you do not walk out feeling overly full. It's a combo of great Italian and California cuisine. The staff is great and the patio is right off of the canal offering a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was one of the places that we wanted to experience. We didn't get the full effect here, but I did drop in for a latte and the classic drip! It was a perfect cup!  Holiday Special: Get $100 gift card, with a $20 gift card included! Sweet!   Excellent customer service! A fair crowd for breakfast on the patio! Gorgeous day on Black Friday!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Loved the decor. Sat on the patio by the waterfront. It was packed on a Saturday but service was still really good. Had the sea bass and it was delicious. One of my favorite places in the area."}
{"text":"Got home after a fun dinner to celebrate my friend's birthday and the super nice boy who filled up our drinks was very friendly!!  He made her birthday all that much better and I'd like to thank all the staff but especially Mason for being more on top of it than our waitress!  Keep up the good work  All around good experience we were all pleased with the food and service."}
{"text":"What a great experience! Celebrating graduation and a birthday. The food was absolutely amazing. Hummus, bread with pesto, sea bass, lasagne bolognese, chicken salad, soup...everything was top notch. Celebratory desserts were also delicious and appreciated. Mary the server was so accommodating and attentive. This is a MUST restaurant to eat at while in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Location, location, location! Right on the canal across the way from old town scottsdale. Love the outdoor seating for the evenings with the lighted palm trees behind. Brought my visitor here and my hubby was there before us. He got seated outside and when we checked in with the hostess, they didnt even try to find him for us.  Just said no one was there waiting for us BUT he was! The 2 ladies seemed a bit rude. Texted him and he said he had a table outside. Kevin was our server and thank goodness for him as he was great.  Friendly and not stuffy. Hubby had ordered bruschettas already and they were decent. Bacon wrapped dates were a little too sweet.  Liked my beet salad as it was refreshing.  Lamb meatballs were my favorite.  Sea bass was cooked well but kind of bland. Shrimp risotto was just average. Ambiance and service of Kevin was what made the night special. Food was just mediocre."}
{"text":"From the moment I walked in, I was blown away by how pretty and vibrant this restaurant was. When I found out that it was a Fox Restaurant, I fell in love even more. Our server was absolutely wonderful and patient with us. The wine selection was great and the drinks were delicious. The outside patio was romantic and beautiful. So why the 3 stars you ask?  I thought the food was nothing special. My expectations might have been higher than usual, due to my love for all of the other Fox Restaurants. The bruschetta was okay - we ordered the mozzarella, prosciutto and manchego. I feel like I've definitely had better bruschetta (Postinos).  The chef's board was nothing special either. I feel like I could have put together a better board. I didn't try the bacon wrapped dates but my friends liked it. My favorite out of everything we ordered were the lamb meatballs. It was sprinkled with a lot of feta cheese so it was absolutely delicious. For the flat bread, we did half short rib and half chicken pesto, and for pastas we ordered the wild mushroom papardelle. Again, I didn't think it was anything I would order again in the future.   The server was sweet and gave us a complimentary chocolate cake for our friend's birthday. The food was mediocre, but I would probably come back and try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"From out of town, looked for a new place to eat with the Mrs. The food is good, not blown away, but definitely a place I'd return to. Love the staff, service, price, venue and location. Went on a Saturday morning had a mimosa with the eggs Benedict and treated ourself to a cheese Danish."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite places in scottsdale! from the atmosphere, to the service to the food. never have any complaints .. well accept their menu varies depending on the time of day... but besides that, I'm there twice a week!"}
{"text":"This was the pertect end to a great night.  The atmosphere is lively and the appetizers were great.  The service was excellent and I loved everything from the small beet salad to the variety of bruschetta.    I will definitely return on a future visit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Have only been here once before under too stressful of circumstances to remember, this trip to Olive and Ivy was fantastic.   Usually going to lunch in Scottsdale is hit or miss with expectations, however today we had a lunch meeting scheduled for 11:30, I got a front row parking spot in front of the valet and had no problem being seated right away.  Sticking to my lunch salad trend, I ordered the Curry Salad with Chicken and couldn't have asked for a more perfect dish on such a warm day. The portions were great, the lettuce cool and crisp and even the \"handmade\" bread and pesto before complimented everything perfectly.   The only gripe I would have, understanding it is a Fox Restaurant, was how almost unnatural the wait staff was with how rehearsed and methodical all interactions were. Even down to the correct usage of \"I am well\" versus \"I am good\" seemed a bit out of place, but not a big deal."}
{"text":"Really liked this place, spacious restaurant with an outdoor patio area. We ordered three types of bruschetta, chicken panini, Mediterranean salad, and cocktails. They bake their own bread and vegetables are super fresh, needless to say nothing went to waste that day! If we are ever in the area, we'd definitely come back. Prices are reasonable and food has good portions."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Old town. I have loved everything I ordered. They also have really good cocktails. Some favorite dishes are the bolognese, the bacon wrapped dates, and the grapefruit mojito. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale visiting family and it was my first time eating at Olive & Ivy. We had the pleasure of having Mason as our server. As far as first time impressions go, Mason hit the mark! His attention to detail, kind and friendly manner and menu knowledge made our experience above the bar!  Our food was delicious! From appetizers to dinner we were very happy!  If you train your entire staff to follow Masons lead, you will exceed your patrons expectations 100% of the time!!"}
{"text":"We took some out of state friends to Scottsdale on to show them around. We decided on renting bikes to get around quicker which was awesome. Of course due to all of the activity we were very parched. We ended up at Olive & Ivy. We were greeted with a smile and seated shortly thereafter. It was a busy late afternoon on a Saturday but they were able to accommodate us on the patio. We ordered drinks and a few flatbreads with a salad to share us. The drinks came out quickly and were very thirst quenching. Our friends had white wine, my husband a beer and I the Grapefruit Mojito which was outstanding. The Braised Short Rib flabread and Pesto Chicken flatbread were a hit but I really enjoyed the Chopped Chicken Salad. We had a very pleasurable experience and would highly recommend to anyone. The only crappy thing  (literally) was that my husband was between the umbrellas and there are a lot of trees/birds. Unfortunately he was bombed twice but he was a good sport and allowed us to laugh at his expense.  I was smart and sat under the umbrella. LOL We mentioned it jokingly to our waitress in passing which we honestly wasn't  expecting anything to be done about it . However the manager came out shortly thereafter and profusely apologized. We weren't complaining about the incident to receive anything in return but they took off my husbands drink as a courtesy. It is so nice to know that there are places out there that employ individuals that really care about service. I truly appreciate  the care not only our waitress  took but management to approach our table to apologize.  Great Job!  Needless to say we will enjoy the patio again but my husband and I will probably compete with sitting under the umbrella for protection."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday with my Mom and two sisters after a day of shopping up Fashion Square. There was a bit of a wait (35+ minutes) which would've been okay if it wasn't 200 degrees at 8pm. In any event, once we were seating I must say everything was perfection. Everyone had some wine, our waiter/service was great, and the food was to die for. We started out with the Parmesan Truffle Fries as a starter - OMG - incredible!   I had the Free Range Chicken which was not only presented nicely but tasted even better. I wasn't a huge fan of the veggies but the mash and chicken were SO good. Everyone else had fish and since I don't eat that stuff I can't comment - but I know everyone was impressed!   We divulged and finished off the night with the Peanut Butter Torte. Again: OMG. The torte itself was amazing but the salted peanut butter gelato on the side was INCREDIBLE. Sigh. Definitely worth the wait. And if nothing else the people watching was fairly priceless..."}
{"text":"\"A steak so tender you can cut it with a butter knife....\"  Ummm, yeah, me thinks not.   Here's the dealio. I am an avid red meat and steak consumer. I can't live without a good dose of meat in me each week...wait, what....yeah, so bearing that in mind, when I came to Phoenix for this work trip, I knew I wanted to have a steak and a nice glass of spicy red wine at some point and so we came here since it was right near the bar we were at earlier.   As soon as we walked in I dug the place. The decor is pretty elaborate and it's easily a million dollar design. Even the bathrooms look like spreads in design mags and with the high ceilings and intimate lighting, it's a home run visually.  After waiting about, oh 20 minutes, we were seated at a table and we all perused the menu. There were quite a few goodies that looked yummy, but my heart and stubborn mind was on steak and a medium rare one at that! I also wanted to try a salad, cuz I was starving and so I ordered the Caesar along with my Rib Eye.  The Caesar was okay at best. It definitely skimped on the dressing, so if you like your Caesar salad, Caesary, then maybe order a side of dressing as well. Then there's the rib-eye. A magnificent looking piece of meat it was, but what did they give me to devour it with?   You guessed it, a butter knife.  Really?  Really.  What in the Backstreet Boy Hell kinda bullsh*t is that? I probably wouldn't have given the tenderness factor a second thought had it not been for the struggle to cut it with the wrong utensil. And it wasn't an oversight either, this is what they intentionally give you to tackle your dinner with.  La-me.  I enjoyed my meal and the steak was tasty, but please, do yourselves a favor and upgrade to steak knives, because it's not tender enough to slice a dull blade through."}
{"text":"Ambience location great - then a slippery slope down hill. Service from kitchen extremely poor, 40 mins between appetizer and main! Then one meal, pork served almost defrosted raw - reheated to edible but the moment had passed. Apologies insincere. Go for atmosphere but not for service or food."}
{"text":"This was amazing. Went there last summer and never did a review. But I will be making a trip back.  Well worth the drive"}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my last dining experience as I was introducing 4 new diners to the restaurant.  We were greeted at the entrance by your cheerful hostess staff and seated in the Stamp Room which was perfect for this group.   The noise level was moderate and we could converse without hearing the background noise from the bar and kitchen areas.  Yasiin was our server.  He has a welcoming smile and was very attentive to our needs throughout the dinner.  Thank you for the complimentary birthday desserts!  I do believe you will have 4 new repeat diners from this experience."}
{"text":"Awesome spot for brunch. The outdoor patio was so inviting. We had an array of food including the short rib flatbread,hummus plate(nothing special) fruit, bacon and pastries (which I would not pass up!) Our waitress was sweet and attentive. $6 dollar table side mimosas was a steeeal! Would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went to Olive & Ivy for dinner on a Saturday night and we had an amazing time. The atmosphere was great. They had a DJ going which really gave it a fun vibe but the ambience was still very classy and open, and cozy. We had the sweet potato cannelloni and it was just spectacular. We are not from Arizona but are down there once or twice a year. Olive & Ivy is definitely on our list of must-go places when we go back."}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy is a great place to unwind and get some great food options with a unique setting close to Old Town Scottsdale.  I love going to their Sunday Brunch (Cinnamon French Toast is unreal) or taking friends that are visiting from out of town!  Love their Bacon Wrapped Dates and Atlantic Salmon to name a few!"}
{"text":"Great place... Very slow service!  Wouldn't recommend for dinner.  Fun for a drink and an appetizer... Management very unapologetic for the delay..."}
{"text":"I finally had the opportunity to try this place.  The atmosphere is fabulous...love the decor which feels sort of chic, elegant yet understated with a great mix of colors and textures...I'm very aesthetic and a beautifully decorated restuarant ususally enhances my reviews :)  We were seated in the far back room which was nice, comfortable, well lit and very quiet.  I was immediately impressed with the lunch menu which felt very comprehensive and certainly not overpriced whatsoever.  I opted for the Curry Chicken Salad ($11) which includes field greens, chicken breast, sliced almonds and golden raisens with a two dressing combination of creamy curry and a red wine vinagarette which I ordered on the side.  I ate every last bite of the salad.  She ordered the Heirloom Beet Salad ($11) which was a very nice presentation.  The focaccia bread with pesto dipping sauce edged my carb craving.  Oh, I can't forget the fabulous Black Iced Tea (with a hint of tropical flavor) which was just delicious.    The service was extremely friendly and attentive...absolutely no complaints whatsoever.  It was an extremely nice dining experience and I'm looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Awesome food. And the ambiance is great, especially the patio. Drinks are always poured with a generous hand. Everything is delicious, breakfast lunch and dinner. Dinner prices are a bit high, but completely reasonable for the area. Great for girls brunch, healthy lunch, or anniversary dinner - a can't miss!!!"}
{"text":"We were here for brunch.  I would recommend due to the atmosphere.  We sat outside on the patio which was quite pleasant.  Our server was absolutely amazing, top notch, didn't miss a beat.    I am giving this restaurant 4 stars mainly for the food.   The coffee is terrible, honestly not sure why restaurants of that quality would not have better coffee?  I ended up ordering a cappuccino which was very nice. The pastries were fantastic, highly recommend.  Especially cinnamon roll.   We had the breakfast burrito which was way too salty, that might sound a little picky, however, for me it was overwhelming.   The potatoes were also very salty."}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice place for a birthday dinner, somewhere that was new for us and had great customer feedback.  So here we went!  Made a reservation on OpenTable.com at the recommendation of other reviews and had no wait at all when we arrived.  We opted for indoor seating, but we noticed misters on the patio a lovely view if you prefer sitting outdoors.  The service was very good.  Our server was knowledgeable about the menu items and prepared to offer recommendations based on pairings, popularity, and individual taste.    The food was excellent.  It is evident that they have put much thought into their menu.  We tried 3 types of bruschetta, veal ravioli, and their chicken main course,  We tried two cocktails, both excellent, and the coconut sponge dessert.  The bill ran about $35 per person before gratuity, but the quality of the menu is totally worth it.  No complaints.   I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Headed to this place for drinks and appies.  The restaurant is hip, spacious and trendy.  This is a great spot for tourists.  The staff were all friendly and apparently all the food is made in-house.   We ordered the calamari and I felt the portion was small and the dish quite salty."}
{"text":"tl;dr: terrible bagels, terrible service, go elsewhere.   If I could give this zero stars I would because it is a sad excuse for a restaurant. They were out of cream cheese at 8AM, but they had butter and jelly which you had to put on your own bagel. That would have been fine had they not charged me for the cream cheese anyway (even though I questioned it). The cashier was super curt with us despite there being nobody else in the line.   They \"toasted\" my bagel in a panini press, which squished it down flat and made it taste like sliced bread. I also ordered coffee, which was below average. The worst part was probably that the lid to the cup was super flimsy (clear plastic that bent every time the cup changed shape, so that when I went to pick up the cup, coffee spilled all over my hands (and I couldn't put the lid on tighter or readjust it).   All around a thumbs down. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"For an airport fast food restaurant this was quick fresh tasty and reasonably priced. Had a Turkey Panini which was very good. Toasted made it outstanding. The bread was fresh and the meat tender. Not a huge turkey fan but I would purchase this again. With water bill was less than $ 10."}
{"text":"Dined at Olive and Ivy last Friday night (very romantical date I might add). Our reservation was at 8:30pm, we arrived about 30 minutes early and they were able to seat us right away. It was cougar central in there so I held my date close because he's a few years my junior.... they were eying us like prize winning hogs, or a coupon for 1/2 price Restylane injections. It was insane. I mean people were noticeably discussing our arrival. These women were not even trying to hide the shit talking. So, mad props \"geriatric mafia\" at the bar. Don't hate!  The wine alone is what warrants 3 stars. Two words: Arizona Stronghold. High five for the local support.  As far as dinner goes, we ordered the Seared Scallops and Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin with side orders of Mascarpone Polenta and Roasted Mushrooms. My date and I happen to enjoy small plate dining and the server was nice enough to split everything up for us so we didn't have to feed each other. The food was...... get ready for it......... okay. Yes, just okay. The quality of the ingredients were phenomenal but flavor wise it just didn't deliver. Don't get me wrong, I don't have anything horrible to say but sorry, not having something bad to say just isn't good enough for a $170.00 dining experience.   I will probably go back and give it another shot at some point. I'm really glad I went with my gut instinct and didn't order the Filet because I am a total fucking steak snob. I have a feeling this review would have read something completely different and dropped in rating. Maybe brunch?  P.S. The chocolate martini was sex in a glass....... like actual sex..... in a glass.  You figure it out.  :)"}
{"text":"Every time I come here the service is terrible on the patio.  For years and years and years always same terrible patio service and rude."}
{"text":"Started off with a Bloody Mary at the bar. Mix is just on the cusp of tasting like cocktail sauce. I have noticed it seems like a \"trend\" now. I believe the horseradish added creates that flavor. Staff is always friendly. Giving KUDOS to our server Jose. He was friendly, attentive, and personable (pass this along if a superior is reading this). Had the Chicken Panini and the brea was soft and the flavors full. By the way, they do have Iced Tea Vodka, just in case you were wondering. Great brunch, with great friends, and a great atmosphere. Thanks Olive & Ivy!"}
{"text":"Great place. Good food and fast service, even on a busy day like Sunday for brunch."}
{"text":"Overpriced most dishes look slopped on the plate. Typical Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Very pleasant environment with great service. Been there many times and never a bad experience.  Perfect for both lunch and dinner. Sometimes both!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was amazing. The service was fast and kind. The food was fresh and hot. The outdoor patio was super relaxing."}
{"text":"This place lures you in with its spacious bar area and the inviting patio of colorful lounge chairs and firepits overlooking the beauty of the Scottsdale Waterfront. It's a great spot to meet up for happy hour or drinks before venturing off to Old Town and start your shenanigans. For my singletons, I will say it is a great starting point for first dates as you can really hit any of the other restaurants once the meet and greet awkwardness wears off (speaking from experience as the lifeline/wingman).  Unfortunately, as with most things deceptively beautiful outside, the interior make up does not always match up. I am about consistency. And both food and service are spotty. They have been phenomenal when we hosted a large birthday dinner in the large room. The bar area is fun and you'll always be able to strike up a conversation with anyone as I love the diverse crowd that hangs out there. Patio service tends to be harder to gauge. I've had fantastic and attentive servers and some not. The sangria and flatbreads are incredible such that you don't realize you might have ordered twice or more times because you want that much more. They used to have a watermelon salad that my tongue craves but has been replaced by a beet salad which isn't a bad stand in. However, I've been here on a Friday night where a friend couldn't get a Coors Light. How do you run out of beer and that beer of all things on a weekend? I also love that you can just pop into the market and grab gelato that has an array of flavor I want to bathe in.  Usually for a FCR, I am generally impressed but Olive & Ivy has struggled to maintain the bar that Sam Fox sets at his other venues such as Culinary Dropout or Arrogrant Butcher. With that said, even low on Sam's radar is pretty high in the restaurant industry."}
{"text":"The decor is very nice.  The patio has a lot of trees which is a nice change around here.  Love the little lights all over the place.  The bread and pesto is delicious.  There is a bit of salt on the crust part of the bread so make sure you leave some fleshy bit to eat with it or it will be too salty.    For entrees we chose lasagna and pepperoni and sausage flatbread.  The lasagna is a bit too sweet for my taste and the sauce may have been too salty.  The garlic bread that comes with it was a little overladen with oil/butter.  It isn't the worst I've ever had, but nothing really to write home about.  The meat actually kind of reminded me of Chef Boyardi...  The pizza was solid.  The crust is very thin.  Nothing too special there.  Dessert was coconut cakes with blood orange gelato and the cheesecake.  The coconut cakes were 2 pieces of dense bits with a scoop of gelato in between.  It was pretty good though I wonder if vanilla ice cream would have been a better choice.  They also had a smear of something that was neither attractive nor additive in any way that I noticed.  The gelato was nice anyway with good flavor.  The cheesecake tasted not so much cakey but just like a very mild cheese.  I've never been a fan of graham cracker crustless cheesecake either.    So I imagine we'll come back here and there, but there's really nothing that will make me crave this place.  The food is solidly decent, but nothing overwhelmingly great that we've tried.  The decor is beautiful though.  Pricing is about average though some of the portions may be slightly on the small side."}
{"text":"Excellent place for lunch/brunch.  Trendy upscale with wonderful outdoor patio by the canal in Old Town Scottsdale.  Weekend brunch menu is large with many good items to choose.  Definitely worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. Delicious food. Had Mediterranean salad, salmon and chocolate cake. The meal and the Cabernet were both great; as was the service and the atmosphere. Good for a group dinner."}
{"text":"We went to Olive and Ivy just for dessert after having dinner at another restaurant with another couple.  It was a beautiful night so we had to take advantage of one of the nicest patios in Scottsdale.  We ordered the warm apple pie with a scoop of Nutella gelato.  I won't be ordering the warm apple pie again.  First of all they shouldn't call it warm, it was room temperature on the outside and cold on the inside.  It looked like a cross between a hot pocket and a apple pie you would get from McDonald's.  The Nutella gelato was amazing.  I will for sure be getting that next time I go back.  The other couple we were with had the ice cream bar and a scoop of cookies and cream gelato.  I didn't try it but they said they enjoyed it.  The hostess was great.  The service from our server was nothing special. He gave us our check after we got our dessert and never came back after that.  No \"can I get you anything?\" and no refill of our empty water glasses.  I've been to Olive and Ivy many times and I will go back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is always good. Service can be slow when it's busy, cause when it's busy here it's busy. Me and my friends come here a lot."}
{"text":"Very cool patio, could use a smidge more mood lighting, but otherwise amazing.  Good place to gawk at the \"Scenesters\"....Expensive menu so stop at the ATM.....food is worth it....The Arugala salad is fab.  Parking blows- pretty much valet only.....  Kinda bumbed because I told the girl 3 different times it was my husbands birthday and it went un-noticed so not a birthday place....good for a first date....  bout it."}
{"text":"A very nice looking place, Food it was good, the service felt under the expectations I had over this place, so trendy, and pricey.... I will like to go back during the winter time here in Phoenix, so I can enjoy better the patio seat around the chiminea."}
{"text":"My friends LOVE this place so I've been quite a bit.  The thing is, I can never really figure out what about it makes them keep coming back.  The food is \"fine.\"  I've come in for breakfast and dinner.  I never had any dish that made me desire to come back without my friends suggesting it.  Usually they suggest great places, so maybe I'm missing the point, but really, I just don't crave this food.  I will say - the service is EXCELLENT.  I've never had a server I didn't like and they always try to make my experience great.  (I actually just added a star to my review because of that.)  So I guess ... try the food, and if you like it, keep comin' back, and if not, get a drink and enjoy the scenery and service."}
{"text":"My wife and I were out driving and we were HUNGRY could not decide where to eat when it dawned on me...Olive &Ivy!  Once again we were not disappointed.  The staff is always superb, love Christian (he's the best), and the food is delicious.  Can I please get the focaccia and basil pesto delivered to my house...daily?! Seriously, I love the food and the service. Keep up the great work, great hires and great food. Restaurant is always the busiest out of all the options in this area, that speaks volumes!!"}
{"text":"Popped in for late night drinks and a bite to eat. Though it was busy the food was terrific and service was great! Nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This space is a big, open area but not so much so that you can't hear each other, which was important to us, as we were meeting up with old friends on our recent trip to Arizona.   The waitress, in describing the menu, made our mouths water. She was excellent in her descriptions. She helped us choose a wine for the table, offering a sample of a Pinot Noir, which we didn't like so much and then steering us to a great Cabernet Sauvignon.  The bruschetta sampler appetizer was perfect for our group of 5. The range of flavors offered was nice too, since we all had different tastes.  I had an entree of scallops which was perfectly prepared, perfectly sized and accompanied by sides that paired with it nicely.  Everyone in our group was very happy with their dinner and dessert. This is definitely the type of restaurant that could be a go-to destination. The service was first class, the food was tasty, and yet the open feel to the area kept it from being stuffy."}
{"text":"I love the patio area of this restaurant and really like their Happy Hour menu.  Like many Scottsdale restaurants, I'm more of a fan of the Happy Hour food than the dinner menu which doesn't have much that appeals to me.  This place is especially nice if you have out of town guests. The location makes it very memorable."}
{"text":"Refused to give water to young teen & referred her to PF Changs.  Olive & Ivy handled this poorly, unprofessionally & pathetically.   PF Changs didn't even hesitate to give her the water.  That's why I ate there instead."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. First things first I have never had pesto this good anywhere else in my life. I don't know what it is but they did it right here.   Also tried the bruschetta trio (funghi, manchego, prosciutto and fig) all three were very good.   The fritto misto was pretty standard plain rings,imo calamari should have the tentacles but still tasted good. Very lightly fried and flavorful  Felt guilty after and got the chopped chicken salad which was very light and flavorful while also being very filling. Had a very interesting peanut granola that accompanied it.  Got to try my friend's sweet potato cannelloni that was incredible as well.   Really great interior design. Would recommend for lunch or a date."}
{"text":"I had this restaurant bookmarked and finally got to try it. It did not disappoint. Our server was friendly and did not rush us. The restaurant has a great selection of wines and gives generous pours. My husband and I tried the bacon wrapped dates and the funghi and prosciutto/fig bruschettas. Both appetizers were really tasty and fresh but I loved the bacon wrapped dates the most. The complimentary focaccia with pesto sauce was also great! The pesto was especially good.   My husband had the chopped chicken salad and loved it. It was very hearty. I was debating between two of the flatbreads to try, and our server offered to do half and half for me. I tried the prosciutto crudo and the funghi trifolati and it was hard to pick a favorite. Both were very flavorful and perfect. My husband also really liked the Bloody Mary mix, which they make in house.  Everything about our experience was great and the prices were so reasonable for all the food we ordered! I will be sure to come back again."}
{"text":"We went here with our daughter for a late lunch today. The truth is I can eat anywhere from trashy to classy. I tend to sit in the middle because that is where I find the best customer service and food, usually. That being said, my partner likes the upper middle fancy to fancy places. So he made reservations to go to Olive & Ivy. It is a typical Scottsdale place. Nice, clean, usually average service. I, however, LOVE Fox Restaurant Concepts and was expecting a sharp on point presentation. We arrived to average friendly hostesses, were seated and then approached by a waitress who brought water and then my ice tea. I asked for a sugar caddy for my tea. She said, \"Sure\" and off she went... not to return to the table. 20 mins later we were approached by a manager, Jake, who clearly saw that we had been sitting there for that amount of time. He came over and I explained the situation thus far. He had paper in hand and was ready to try and correct this experience asap! I have to say, I was in the mindset to never return! Jake worked his magic and our food came out in under 10 mins without the quality being compromised. He took over our table and was on top of refills, making sure everything was perfect and did his best to make us go from \"Never Again\" to \"I'll give them another chance.\" That was his whole goal and he succeeded with flying colors! Thank you Jake for making what easily was going to be a one star come back up to a four star. I'll give an update review the next time I visit!"}
{"text":"This was probably my favorite spot of all the places I visited on my Scottsdale vacation. Everything from ambiance, to service, wine and food was superb. We liked it so much we came twice. The first night was a Friday night. The restaurant had so much life, attracting visitors and locals looking for a nice place to socials, dine and drink good wine. I loved the outdoor lounge area overlooking the water. Situated in the heart of old town, with the happening older nightlife.   Our intention was to just grab an appetizer and wine and head to another location for dinner but we loved the vibe so much we stayed. They had a dj inside that played a great mix of music, to keep the place lively and fun. The second night was a Monday, Halloween evening. Much more mellow, still just as enjoyable. This time around we got a bottle of red for $30 that was delicious and got a nice little buzz!  Food?! Everything looks good. Whether you're going for wine and shareables, cheese platter, main dish or dessert. We loved the mozzarella bruschetta, mushroom pasta dish and two scoops of gelato for dinner. Chop salad is also good, but had what seemed like granola on top... kinda weird! Will definitely be back on my next visit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My friends and I dined here yesterday night.  Our server Amber was great and on top of things.  We started with bruschetta which was delicious.  I really liked the mozzarella one.  I had a Caesar salad which was so good, definitely in my top 3 I've ever had.  It was very flavorful.  I had the chicken scallopini for my entree.  It was very good however it came with so much spinach it would have been nice to have something else on the plate as well (mashed potatoes would have been nice)."}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy is still a fun place to go for HH on a Friday night.  We came last evening with some old friends and had fun time catching up. The menu has recently been updated, but all the deliciousness found on the old one is still here. Remember to make reservations if you can -- the wait list was over an hour.   We started off with light cocktails of white wine. Their spirits list is pretty impressive at Olive & Ivy, so are the mixologists behind the bar. You won't go home thirsty.   We ordered a bunch of things to nosh on.  Their flat bread pizza is still outstanding and the Scallops are delicious.  We also saved room for the Gelato machine behind the bar -- a must on your way out.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is in the heart of Old Town so the atmosphere has a great vibe!  It has a good wine list.. prices are a bit high but worth an occasional nite on the town.  It was a fun place to meet up with friends for cocktails with a live dj!  The calamari was the best I have had in awhile.  Service was a bit slow in the lounge.  Great patio with a firepit, fountain and plenty of seating with misters."}
{"text":"This is a good patio spot in Scottsdale. The fig and ginger mule is a great take on a moscow mule; spicy and refreshing. The corn flatbread and beet salad are my top two food choices on the menu. I would say the only downside to this restaurant is happy hour is only offered in the bar and lounge. If you go to dinner early, unfortunately this great happy hour menu can't be enjoyed. Be sure you make reservations!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch, the service was wonderful, the bread/pesto was delicious (much better then the typical bread and butter!). I ordered the breakfast burrito and potatoes - also very tasty! Their homemade salsa was great too! The decor and ambiance is perfect for a date, hanging with friends, or taking a parent out to eat. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's sub-freezing here in Salt Lake City today. Arctic chill, crunchy snow, frozen snot freezing. And yet just a few short days ago I had lunch on the patio of Olive & Ivy in the sunshine with a happy little breeze blowing through the place.  So perhaps I'm attaching a little more magic to the experience than is totally merited, but when we strip away the ambiance and charm of eating outside in January I'm still left with some delicious food.  I was immediately impressed with the bread and pesto. Zing! Lots of bite to it to help you remember the taste. We ordered a couple of flatbreads for the group and scarfed them down in no time. Then again, you put asparagus on just about anything and I'd eat it.  I ordered a simple turkey sandwich and was not disappointed. I'd like to try a few other menu items as well, because I'm not sure I had the best of the best, but still it hit the spot just the same and I'd eat it again.  As mentioned, our server (DeAnne?) was on top of things--totally professional, dedicated to her job, and one hundred percent darling. You heard me. I said darling."}
{"text":"Conveniently located near the Scottsdale Fashon, this place is great for a nice lunch before you shop 'til you drop. The restaurant doubles as a marketplace, so you can buy some goods while you're there too.  The decor is clean and fresh and simply done.    Now on to the food.  The one thing to describe their food (at least the two dishes I tried there) is lots and lots of oil.  Maybe that's why it tasted so good.  The Funghi Trifolati flatbread was recommended.  The mushroom and arugula is a wonderful pairing for the simple dish.  The tallegio cheese stretches beautiful when I took a bite.  The only thing I wished was that the thin bread was more crispy.  It was too soft for my taste.  And of course they drenched it with olive oil.    The mushroom tortelli ordered was a light classic dish that was cooked wonderfully as well.  I preferred this dish over the flatbread.  The ravioli was cooked a bit adante which was great, and the flavors blended well with the mushroom.  What I remembered of the sauce was that it was light and drenched in oil again.  See the trend? :-)  But   Overall, I would give a thumbs up for Olive & Ivy.  Happy eating in 2013!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service - their brunch menu is fantastic. I had the sausage breakfast sandwich with the house-made English muffin - incredible. This is already a regular brunch stop for us and will continue to be one as long as they keep making food like that."}
{"text":"Went here last night for a family dinner and the food was great, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates, hummus with veggies , mozzarella bruschetta (which we were expecting more than a few slices but only came with 2 slices) , pesto chicken flatbread and wild mushroom papperdelle! All of these items where amazing highly recommend the bacon wrapped dates! As far as cocktails you have to try the pomegranate daiquiri or fig & ginger mule! The location is right next to the mall and near the waterfront and we sat in the patio that overlooked the water! Love this place I'll definitely be back for happy hour :)"}
{"text":"Every single bite was delicious and the outdoor patio location on the river made for a perfect first evening out in Scottsdale. We had heard the food in Phoenix could be hit-or-miss but Olive & Ivy was surprisingly great.   We started with the artichoke appetizer with sous vid artichoke hearts, arugula, and parmesan - woah, so so good. Hubby and I split the Shrimp Scampi Risotto that was super lemony and fresh as well as the Chicken Scallopini which was like the best chicken parmesan with savory sauce EVER. We topped the meal with the Chocolate Bar; a chocolate mousse with cherry chip ice cream that was incredible.   Several people in the know recommended Olive & Ivy and they didn't steer us wrong. Would highly recommend to out of towners looking for a nice dinner in Scottsdale. $120 for drinking two before tax and tip. Service was exceptional."}
{"text":"Loved this place the first 2 times I went and then the same dish wasn't as good... However, the salmon is always amazing. I love the atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the cafe for lunch about a dozen times (much more than my number of check-ins would suggest) and each time it was consistently good.  However, I've never had the pleasure of dining inside the actual restaurant until Friday.  The service, food, and decor are all top notch.  Although the price of my entree was ridiculous in my opinion ($26 for 3 shrimp atop risotto), everything else was excellent.  The bread and pesto they give you to start is phenomenal, the lamb meatballs are tender and delicious as was the tzatziki, and the shrimp and risotto was perfect as well.  The margherita flat bread was just ok and we should have opted for one not as basic.  Next time for sure.  My only advice is to either make a reservation or come early.  The place fills up fast around dinner time but 6:30 is a safe bet for early-birds without a reservation.  Also, the better the weather the more prime the real estate on the patio so get there super early to reserve your spot out there."}
{"text":"Im only giving this restaurant a five star review because the service and atmosphere were AMAZING. The food and drinks were terrible and we didn't finish anything. They were very generous and discounted our bill without us having to ask. I wish I could remember the servers name. I would come back and order another choice and hope it improved. Beautiful restaurant. I hope the kitchen can get it together."}
{"text":"This place is nice and upscale. If you go at night though, the music is really loud. If you're ok with that, the food is very good. Last time I went they had a smores dessert with homemade toasted marshmallow on top. Delicous."}
{"text":"Hey Fox concepts: Is it your concept to be consistently Rude to customers. Wake Up.  This is strike 2 for this restaurant. I will not bring my customers again. You have to have a meeting of you hostesses wait staff and management. Last Thursday I walked in with 3 peaple. I was told 3 times that is 5:00 and no happy hr on the patio  with tables  So Ok rude hostess.... fine.  The waitress...  3 times are you dinning. Wine appetizers then we shall see.  She did not like that answer and rudely sat us.  The appetizers were very Small and just Ok.  We had 2 bottles of wine but the waitress kept  on asking about food to the point where we decided to have dinner else ware. We are locals fox not Snowbirds.  Today I walked in at 11:30 we were 4 peaple. Same attitude.   Sorry their is  an 1/12/ hr wait . We only take reservations and you do not have one. Hardly anyone was on the patio at that time......  A manager walk by and asked how we were doing . I said Not Ok . And she just ignored my comment and walked on her very busy way. My 1st time customers and friends reminded me that their is Plenty of restaurants in the are that want our bussiness. So we left....   To note ... Fox . That we told this story to a neighboring restaurant and he agreed that you guys Turn Off more people and that's great for this bussness.  If you care this was at 11:30 today.. Check the time sheets .....  I doubt if I will give you a 3 rd time because My Time is valuable also ..."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Sit on the patio on a nice day.  Good service.  The ahi tuna tacos sounded great, but were so so.  The tomato and mozerella salad was good and so was the arugula with apples salad.  The free Pesto bread was great.  The sangria was not very good. All in all a nice place, but there is so much choice in that area that I would go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Like other reviewers have said, I expected a more intimate setting and was surprised to see something so large and bustling. Not a bad thing, just a mismatched expectation-reality thing.  We started with some bruschettas. All good! Especially loved the mozzarella and apple caponata ones. For my main I had the big eye tuna--gorgeously done. Nice big chunks of meat that were seared nicely, on a bed of couscous and yumminess. I tried a bit of my dad's spicy pasta. SO spicy. Impressively spicy, really.   The desserts were also great, and I have a hard time picking my favorite. Perhaps the coconut cakes in that soupy coconut sauce. I didn't get to try the chocolate cake but it looked really good.  We were in the back room which offered us *some* respite from the noise of the restaurant (a great thing when they bring in an actual DJ and you're just trying to eat dinner!), but it also offered a blast of cold air each time a server went outside to help one of the diners sitting under a heatlamp. Oh well."}
{"text":"Love Olive & Ivy, came here for a work dinner and I knew I had to come back on my own (wait, I can't do anything alone, so I put together a girls night out.) Don't wanna lie to you, we came here for the Happy Hour, this girl has to save some coin, I've got kids!  Happy hour selection is small but big enough to find what you want!  This is what I've tried there for happy hour, ready?  1) Bacon wrapped dates, OMG! They were delish and HELLO, there's BACON!  2) Lamb meatballs, good grief, they were tender and so delicious, total party in my mouth. Their Tzatziki sauce was on point too!  3) Their french fries, rather, their TRUFFLE FRIES, someone hold me back!!! Totally shareable. God, they were good.   4) Hummus. Who doesn't love hummus? Served with grilled pita and some veggies, it was delightful.  O.k., o.k., I get it, I pretty much ordered everything off the happy hour menu but the prices were so darn cheap.  BEVERAGES!!!  Ladies, order their Sangria, 'nuff said."}
{"text":"I can never go wrong with a restaurant from Fox Concepts it seems! The bar area is definitely good 'people watching' and I love the modern contemporary decor. Where did they get the lighting for the bar area? The menu is healthy mediterranean and I love sitting outside on the patio. They also feature a 'take-out market-side' - I think they have some top notch croissants too!! I haven't been there for brunch yet so that's on my list and will have to return!"}
{"text":"\"Mediterranean cuisine with a Californian flare.\" Well I think this is my first Yelp review, and for good reason, too!  The girlfriend and I just dined here on Valentine's Day (coincidentally the gf's birthday) and the whole experience was top notch. It all started when I called to make a reservation weeks ago and they asked if we were celebrating anything else so I mentioned the birthday and that was that. Made reservations for the beautiful patio on VDay.  Flashforward to the 14th and the experience was wonderful. Parking underground was super convenient - elevator brings you up right next to the restaurant. We were immediately seated right next to the Waterfront with a great view and phenomenal weather.  Now the food (finally, this guy got to the food): Disclaimer, the menu was a VDAY specific menu, so don't get too excited about what you read here because it might not be the usual! Cocktails were A+. I got a blood orange paloma (delicious compliments with the tequila) and the gf got a mojito, also delicious. Cocktail menu was very diverse and had interesting flavor pairings - wish I could have drank more if I wasn't driving the birthday girl around!  FOOD! We started with the hummus with vegetables appetizer. Delicious hummus, slight kick to it made it stand out compared to other bland hummuses. The pita and vegetable selection was also very fresh. For entrees, the gf got the chicken scallopini which had well-crusted (slightly crispy, not fried) chicken on top of some sauteed greens - fantastic. I got the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin, cooked medium at the chef's recommendation. Also phenomenal but there was something special about the tangy/spicy BBQ sauce on top. Will definitely dream about this dish.  Now here's the special part, free dessert (twice baked chocolate cake, amazing) with a personal birthday message written in icing! I was so pleased they went to such care for us when they had hundreds of other couples trying to make their own VDay special.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Excellent place to have a snack or late lunch in the afternoon while shopping over at the mall.  We had salads and appetizers which were delicious.  The servers and other staff were very attentive, almost too attentive at times the two of us felt initially like there was someone always coming up to our table asking to help us!  We had the beet salad and the mediterranean salad, as well as the lamb meatballs which were delicious and the calamari fritti.  All four were excellent choices.  It was not too busy.  Music is a little loud if you want to have private conversation, but the atmosphere is trendy but casual and inviting."}
{"text":"Fox Restaurant Concepts did it again.   This place rocks! Fantastic offerings of wine, atmosphere & flavor."}
{"text":"Had a family Sunday brunch there. We all ordered our food and waited patiently for our food. When our meals were delivered the waiters told my 11 year old granddaughter they were out of what she ordered, and proceeded to give us our meals while she didn't get hers. I cannot believe he didn't come to let us know before. So while we ate she sat and watched. When she then decided to order a muffin and asked what kind they had, he read off the list. She told him which one she wanted and he came back 5 minutes later telling her they were out of those too. NEVER AGAIN WILL WE GO BACK. For a server to deliver meals and then telling someone they were out of what she ordered is totally unacceptable,  but to do it to a child is worse."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great atmosphere, service, and really good food! If you are a business traveler and are looking to meet others,have a drink and good food this is your place. Never disappointed by the experience"}
{"text":"Had a very pleasant lunch here. Nice patio on the canal, comfortable, good music, not loud. Great staff, attentive, but not imposing. Food very fresh and tasty. Definitely going back to this one. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday late afternoon for dinner for the first time. The atmosphere and decor was amazingly put together. The staff was great but the food was terrible. I was expecting so much more. If I'm going to pay that much for food I expect it to taste good. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the standards of the decor and environment. I will not be coming back or recommending."}
{"text":"Great knowledgeable wait staff and QUICK!!! My girl fell in love with the pesto spread for the in house made focaccia and her martini! I loved my lasagna. Great warm interior too"}
{"text":"The food is good, service is so-so, its loud. Its in a great location."}
{"text":"This place is my fav. Brunch or dinner...great food. My favorite is the spicy shrimp risotto! They provide the best bread with amazing pesto dip. The patio is right along the water, yet the ambiance in the dining room is delightful. Staff is always friendly- I've never had bad service and I go often.  Must check it out!!"}
{"text":"Took the family here for dinner and it was great.   Had the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin and the early reviews were right, could cut it like butter.  Great flavor.  Also, we had the bacon wrapped dates.  Everyone in my family loved their entrees."}
{"text":"I hate going out for valentine's day.  the prices are jacked up, and the menus are usually uninspired using the cheapest ingredients possible.    I can't speak for their normal menu, but our valentine's dinner was amazing.  lobster bisque with corn fritters, lobster ravioli, pork 3 ways...the chocolate dessert that had a small peice of 6 different desserts...simply amazing.  the patio atmosphere is great too, the waitstaff were very friendly."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Old town Scottsdale! Great price and atmosphere! Their calamari shrimp tempura at lunch was amazing. I keep going back because it's consistently delicious."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic brunch at Olive & Ivy. The food, service, and ambience was excellent. My favorite part was watching the food being cooked and the fresh bread coming out.   For brunch, I got a mixture of savory and sweet. The Cinnamon Roll came out first and it was huge, warm, and delicious. After enjoying the pastry, I was worried the main entrees would fall short but the Lamb Gyro and the Potato Hash were also very tasty.   What I recommend for Brunch/Lunch: -- Lamb Gyro"}
{"text":"I love to get a salad here before a flight.  The food is very fresh and always delicious."}
{"text":"My aunt and I came back! Thanks for the dress code you address to the woman I stating about. We took my great aunt out for lunch and it was a very lovely ladies lunch out. Food was delicious as always and our waiter was the same as the last time and again he was outstanding. Thanks"}
{"text":"LOVED IT.   Sat in Jeremy's section, DUDE KILLED IT.  Total pro: knows his wine, nailed the service.   We'll be back and will recommend this place!"}
{"text":"To be honest I have zero complaints. The atmosphere was very calm, from the music to the dim lighting. Our server, Clenard was very genuine and an all around caring, helpful man. It's rare to find a place that has good atmosphere, food, and a genuine staff. I'm not the best with words, but I trust if you go you won't be displeased."}
{"text":"Great service! We had a professional server, Clenard, who told us he's been in the business 15 years. It really showed and made our dinner a delight. (He should think of being a consultant to other restaurants which have great food but mediocre service.)  We started with the bruschetta, a trio of mushroom, fig, and mozzarella. Each was a happy mouth experience.   The chicken chopped salad was big and rich, plenty for both of us. It was topped with \"peanut granola\" for that salty sweet crunchy somethin-somethin. Yum!  The outdoor seating was a beautiful alternative to the blaring music inside the restaurant.   We will go again and recommend you do so as well."}
{"text":"We had a group dinner here in October and had a great experience.  The restaurant is always packed and the atmosphere is always lively and beckons you to stay and enjoy the surroundings.  I started with the stuffed dates, enjoyed the scallops with asparagus and corn for my entree, and shared the vanilla tart and lemon tres leches cake with our group.  The food was great, the service was attentive and the atmosphere was welcoming.  Definitely a great place to enjoy the great patio for drinks and food."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  Everything from a casual lunch to group parties are always fun at Olive & Ivy.  All around great place. The appetizers and drinks are spot on with plenty of share able dishes. We'll be back to O&I many more times."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have an awesome martini with St. Germain and Gin - love it! I also love the flatbread pizza and the wine list. The bar is large and friendly and you can always feel the warm breeze from the door - I love places that leave the doors open!  I loved this place years ago when I used to vacation here, now I live here and can go whenever I want! YAY!"}
{"text":"I liked this place... it is owned by the same person that owns sauce, bloom and the green house...   I love the dining room... they have nice loungy couches that make it a private dinner... i can not complain about my meal (or the meals of my dinner mates)... none of us knew what to get so we asked the server what her favorites were... we ended up getting 3 of the 5... we had the scallops, ravioli and some sort of meat... all of them i would get again... check it out... it has not been opened long"}
{"text":"My mom and I tried this place out before hitting the mall during her most recent visit to town. Our first impression was the space and decor. It's very large and open, contemporary and easy to people watch... one of our favorite sports. We came after lunch and just before dinner on a Sunday. There was a significant crowd giving the time of day and day of the week. They were only serving flatbread and dinner salads at the time and we settled on sharing two flatbreads. I ordered the Pesto and she the Fig & Prosciutto along with a  pitcher of the white sangria.   We sat in the bar area in some leather couches and sofas that line the bar. Very comfortable but we could have done with a larger table being that there were only two of us and we had a hard time managing in a space that was meant for 4.  The Pesto flatbread was my favorite of the two. Roasted garlic cloves, lots of cheese, fresh tomato... what more could one want? The pesto was very good and gave the perfect amount of flavor. It was my ideal flatbread. The fig & prosciutto was good as well. It was a very unexpected pairing with fig, prosciutto, goat cheese and spinach. Being that goat cheese is one of my favorites, I felt like it was lacking. I probably wouldn't order this again but it wasn't tragic either by any means, just not exactly my taste. The white sangria was great. Very refreshing and an interesting combination of juices and flavors. I just wish that the pitcher wasn't more ice than sangria.   Our service wasn't fantastic nor was it awful as others have described.   Although I didn't order off of it the wine list was very extensive but it was also on the pricey side."}
{"text":"I stuck with the prepped food and was happy with the freshness of the chopped salad--hearty and well-balanced flavored: spinach and other dark greens, feta, cherry tomatoes, bacon... Good stuff.  Also had the butcher pizza. Rich and satisfying."}
{"text":"This place was so good I ordered seconds.  After waiting for the pizza I ended up missing my plane!  Doesn't matter food was so good I didn't care.  5 stars."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants we've been to!  We didn't even bother with the apps because we were told how filling and good the pastas were. We ordered the WILD MUSHROOM PAPPARDELLE and the SWEET POTATO CANNELLONI! Both were AMAZINGGGGG! The sweet potato was our favorite which is strange because I usually find it too sweet and rather enjoy spicy pasta. But wow SO SO good!"}
{"text":"Now I can say that I've dined here for breakfast and dinner.   We elected for grabbing breakfast in the front as the restaurant wasn't open.  You're able to sit anywhere you chose, grab a number, and they will bring your breakfast to you.  They have a small menu selection.  I went w/ the smoked salmon platter, it's a classic & you can't really go wrong.  I also had the yogurt parfait - it was really good.  All the berries in there were fresh and in season.    For dinner, I enjoyed the calamari appetizer, duck & spinach ravioli, and sangria.  The calamari was pretty oily - it would've been nice to have a piece of paper at the bottom of the serving platter.  The ravioli was good, and the bite of sea bass that I had was good too.   Surprisingly the dessert didn't catch my eye.  But the server was great.    On a last note I set up a group private dining event a couple of years ago and they absolutely enjoyed it and I want to say there's a private outdoor area as well attached to the PDR.  My group had nothing but rave reviews.    All in all it gets 5 stars for the ambiance with the seating outside by the river, and great service."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful and energetic restaurant food was good and drinks were amazing when we finally got them, service left a lot to be desired which was disappointing"}
{"text":"This may be one of my favorite late breakfast spots for a Saturday morning. The outdoor patio makes me feel like I'm on vacation. The pesto and bread at the beginning is a great way to start. I also love the mimosas, breakfast sandwich with potatoes on the side and a cinnamon roll to split. If it's too hot to sit outdoors, I love sitting up at the bar."}
{"text":"My family and I visited Olive and Ivy for brunch. The decor of the venue was fabulous and the ingredients for the food was fresh. My chopped salad was delicious and my wife's pouched egg sandwich was light and flavorful. We are heading back soon to try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Nice please! Inside was pretty up scale. The lunch prices were not bad at all. Went for lunch and had the bacon burger which was yummy! Excellent excellent service! It was busy but they had enough staff and no waiting for a table. Served bread and olive oil which also was amazing. I tried the berry gelato, pretty good. Highly recommend this place for lunch. Will have to go back and try dinner."}
{"text":"Went here after a college graduation and ordered the lasagna. 10/10 would order again. The lasagna was bowl based and stayed hot for the duration of the meal. The strawberry shortcake was fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Quality of food, atmosphere and service is always the best here (and the drinks are deliciously strong!) :)"}
{"text":"No line for a reason. Customer service is terrible and food is mediocre. Employees there are worthless."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant!   Dined here last fall for my boyfriend's birthday. The restaurant is beautiful and has a very romantic vibe. There's patio seating outdoors, near the water.  As for food, we received complimentary bread and pesto. We ordered the fritto appetizer (deep fried calamari, zucchini, and shrimp), ahi tuna, and the mushroom truffle pappardelle). The tuna was seared and had a nice miso/teriyaki flavor. I think the pasta dish could have used a bit more cheesy flavor. For dessert we received a birthday dessert on the house-- strawberry shortcake with sorbet.  Our waiter was very attentive and hospitable.   I would definitely dine here again!"}
{"text":"We landed at Olive and Ivy at the suggestion of our Uber driver.  Listen to your Uber drivers, folks.  We were able to score an outdoor table with the firepit in the middle.  Great ambiance with the water behind us and the rustle of the wave sculpture (don't know what it is called, but super cool).  We started with the bacon wrapped dates and the salmon, avocado and prosciutto bruschetta, all of which were fantastic.  We all ordered mixed drinks, and we all enjoyed them.  I ordered the fig & ginger mule...then I ordered another one :).  For my entree I devoured the scallops, which melted in my mouth.  Others at the table ordered the wild mushroom pappardelle and bacon wrapped tenderloin and we were all very impressed."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch at Olive & Ivy started with a request for a window seat. As inviting as the patio looked, we were seduced by the comforts of indoor air conditioning. So modern are the cluster of amber lights suspended above the bar & attractive upholstered booths.   Our server was super enthusiastic about describing top sellers on the menu. I found his energy addictive (it helped me wake up!), but my friend found his over-exaggerated approach to be tiresome (like, can I just have my eggs with some peace & quiet, man!)   We ordered:  -- freshly-squeezed OJ: delicious, refreshing, sweet, lots of pulp  -- egg sandwich on a brioche bun for him  -- cheddar biscuit w/ scrambled eggs & sausage gravy for me: underseasoned on all fronts; gravy could've used a bit of pepper, eggs needed to be salted, biscuit was neither buttery nor flakey (more like mushy & starchy.) Side of potatoes were also blah.   Olive & Ivy's menu reads like a brunch lover's dream (& the Mediterranean twist doesn't hurt), but their potential has yet to be unlocked. Where are the exciting flavors to match your impressive decor & animated staff?"}
{"text":"This totally hurts my heart to write this, but I had such an awful experience at this location.   I went the other evening, and it was honestly pretty quiet. When I walked in, the hostess was gossiping so loudly with one of the servers, and I usually wouldn't care, but they were complaining about another server (I think) and it was just so nasty and it really put a bad taste in my mouth. They ignored me until they were done with their conversation, too, so it was really awkward for me.   So after my awkward/distasteful beginning, I get seated. The server comes over and asks what we would like to drink - I order a fig and ginger mule, and my friend ordered some sangria. We also order the calamari and veggies to start. The server brought me my mule, but forgot the sangria. Fifteen minutes later, the app comes out, and it is cold. Still no sign of my friends sangria. We mention that the calamari was cold to our server, who says that just happens sometimes but that it seemed pretty warm when it was brought out. We were confused by the response, but its whatever. We order dinner - Ahi tuna for me, pesto chicken for my friend. It takes forever to come out. Still no sangria for my friend, which we pretty much just give up on at this point.   The food came and it was good, which is why this is 2 stars instead of 1. It took a very long time on a very un-busy night for our food to come out, so I'm not sure if our waiter forgot to put it in or if there was just some mishap in the kitchen.   When the bill came, the sangria (which we never received) was still on there. We told our server, who seemed irritated, and another 15 minutes went by before we got the updated bill. I totally get everyone has their off days, and I love Sam Fox concepts, but I don't think I'll be returning to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"One of the pricier Fox restaurants but it definitely has some of my favorite food. The bruschetta is beyond delicious and all of the main courses I have ever had are amazing as well. Friendly service and really great looking place. It can be a bit of a wait so make your reservation well in advance."}
{"text":"Cool Place!  Loved the vibe I got from this place. The food was really good my friends and I really enjoyed it.  I ordered their pizza with a glass of coke our server \"Jen\" was really cool! I would recommend this place if you want something on a budget but looking for more upscale place."}
{"text":"The place is very cool, a very pretty atmosphere. The menu is pretty simple which is great, I don't need complicated stuff. I had the chicken chopped salad and it was very good! Very similar yet but flavorful. The waiter was great and had a great sense of humor. The only thing that bothered me was I ordered ice tea which was amazing but he never once offered to refill mine or anyone else at the table. That's the only negative. I would go again for dinner"}
{"text":"So cute in here, clean, great service, open. I love being able to see the chefs do their thing in the kitchen. And MY Mediterranean salad with grilled chicken was delicious!"}
{"text":"A great place to sit on the patio and enjoy the company of friends or family.  Casual and yet classy.  The food and drinks are great!"}
{"text":"I can only speak for the morning experience as that's the only time I've been. The food is excellent and the coffee is great, much better than Starbucks. The morning staff is helpful and friendly, especially Nathan and Elle. Love coming here for breakfast. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Sure, the food at Olive & Ivy is good, but there are plently of places, even Fox RC places, that I have been to that are better.   Whenever I go to Olive & Ivy, I feel that the service is a little snooty, even from the point where you walk in the door. I always seem to be greeted by a somewhat inconsiderate hostess, and the servers to be honest really aren't that much better. You can tell that they are completely fake when they come to take your oders/bring you food, because they're scrounging for a good tip, which they expect from this restaurant's normal clientele-- the well-off businesspeople out to lunch or the Scottsdale moms that congregate to go out to brunch.   The food, like i mentioned, is decent. I almost always get their Mediterranean Salad with some grilled salmon on top. It's usually pretty decent, but definitely overpriced. You get about 1 1/2 standard measuring-cup cups of mixed greens, some cous-cous and other fillers, with about a 3-ounce portion of salmon all for around $21. And that's just for the salad, not including drinks.   Just about the only thing that keeps Olive & Ivy from getting a two-star review is their delicious pesto and bread that they serve (upon request) before you get your meal. It's honestly really delicious, light, and the pesto isn't too garlicy or salty. It is on the smaller side, so make sure you ration it properly between yourself and any of the other guests who you're dining with.    3 stars for:   Pros:  Decent food   Cons:  Bleh service Small portions Overpriced   Bottom Line: Yeah, i'll be back, as long as I'm not the one footing the bill."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Olive & Ivy since it opened a few years ago on the waterfront. I love the location and i have come here consistently because I love having a latte on the patio as well as enjoying the food.  This year i have noticed that the coffee has absolutely no taste. When I question the bar staff, they tell me that it is the same and that it comes from Seattle. I consider myself a connoisseur of good coffee, having lived in Europe and South America. Something has changed and, with great reluctance, i will be looking for a new coffee place.  I hope that the manager/ owners read reviews."}
{"text":"It's just hard to give them anything less.  They have the best patio in Scottsdale.  They are always open.  I can usually get a table without a reservation or too long of a wait, or we figure out a spot in the non reserved patio area (which is where i want to be anyway). The food is always consistent. And these guys care...service is always awesome. There must be a no-attitude policy with their servers bc they are always pleasant.  I'm a fan of the med-salad and i add salmon and often will split if i'm there with a girlfriend.  it's the perfect meal and a bottle of cab.  The wines are priced very reasonably.  It's a great neighborhood spot.  PS: Their bloody mary's are really good too."}
{"text":"Love this place!! So yummy. When with friends I always get the Chef's Board and the artichoke heart salad and it is amazing. Pretty much everything I've ordered here is good. A little on the pricier side but worth it for the atmosphere. I recommend sitting outside in the lounge area on a nice afternoon."}
{"text":"This place was quick and really tasty! We had a little over an hour during our layover in PHX and were looking for something small - the Breakfast Club was $7.95 but was very tasty! Egg, cheese, bacon, avocado, & mayo on an english muffin was pleasantly surprising (cant expect too much from fast food, right?)  The cashier was also very efficient and friendly. They don't have hot tea (only coffee, iced tea, smoothies) - but she said if I had my own tea bag she'd happily give me a cup of hot water for free! (good thing I took the extra from the hotel the day before!)"}
{"text":"We were visiting for Spring Training and made reservations here on a recommendation of a friend. So glad we did! We sat out on the patio for dinner and although the night was not really warm, the heaters kept the temp just right. Food was reasonably priced and absolutely delicious! Lots of different choices. Our server Kevin was very capable and knew just when to check on us without hovering! We were never wanting for anything and he seemed to just show up at the right time. Can't wait to go back when we return to Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Our server was very pleasant and gave good recommendations. The flatbreads were great and sweet potato pasta was delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant to go too. Love everything about it. Can't say anything negative about this place!!  Totally go if your in Scottsdale Arizona!!"}
{"text":"Had the Mediterranean salad to go for $7 and I was very impressed with the quality, taste and size of the salad. Lettuce cucumber tomatoes feta cheese couscous and almonds. Really tasty and filling. Loved it. And the price is right for airport food."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!!!!  I went with 4 co workers and we had such a great time.  The food was amazing and the atmosphere was really nice.  Not too casual and not too fancy.  Great spot for a date or a family.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"great place...fun atmosphere...great food...but pricey.... great date night restaurant anytime...If you wanna save money dont order alcoholic drinks nor desert... if you are craving desert, just go to their gelato store in house and have a scoop...its cheap, tasty and still keeps you in the restaurant."}
{"text":"YUM! This place not only has cute decor, but also great food and friendly, helpful service.  I sat at the bar since I came here alone while I'm visiting town for work. I had seen such great reviews which led me to come here as my first dining experience in the city.  The bartender was very friendly and attentive (I didn't catch his name but he had a man bun so shout out to him for management, he was great!). I started with the grapefruit mojito which both looked and tasted great.  Next I ordered a bruschetta trio: - Manchego quince & Spanish chorizo - Avocado, sweet corn, charred scallion & feta - Brussels sprout, whipped goat cheese, prosciutto & sherry gastrique   They were all delicious but my favorites were the Brussels and manchego ones. I also liked that they were pretty sizable but each piece was also cut into 3 smaller bites to make it a bit easier to eat (although still messy!).  I also ordered the lamb meatballs and omg - flavor heaven!! I typically never eat lamb but these has such amazing flavor and has an in-house made tzatziki sauce which was just *muah* The bartender who served me described these best as a type of deconstructed gyro - hey come with grilled, slices pita slices as well. Again, sizable portion as well.  This place was great and I do not have enough old things to say - glad I stopped here on my trip!"}
{"text":"Another Sam Fox restaurant. Food is decent but the location is better. Cool vibe. Good for get togethers. Worth coming to if in the area."}
{"text":"Ok seriously how is it possible for one place to have top notch customer service AND amazing food!?!? I am enjoying by far the best cinnamon roll ever and dude made my mocha perfectly! Thank you Olive and Ivy you make my mornings so much better!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I met a friend from out of town for brunch today. I didn't really know what this place about except for the fact that it served brunch and that it was in Scottsdale. The suite number is 195 off of Marshall Way. It was a little tricky for us to find it being that it was our first time. There are off street parking and if that's not available, there's a free parking garage just kitty corner of the restaurant.   We made reservations for 3 for 11:45, the place was packed so we were glad that we made reservations.   We started off with some brunch cocktails: OLDTOWN HOUND $9 rutte gin, st. germain, arizona grapefruit BELLINI $8 peach purée, peach liqueur, smirnoff vodka, prosecco IVY & GINGER $11 smirnoff vodka, canton ginger, pineapple, sparkling wine   I had the Ivy & Ginger, you definitely taste the pineapple - nice refreshing drink. They had the Bellini and Oldtown Hound - both of them enjoyed their drinks.  I ordered the SMOKED SALMON* (toasted bagel, tomato, caper & red onion)  for $11 on an Everything Bagel. This was not the best Lox Bagel I've ever had; the salmon was a little saltier than I'd like. The nice part is this came disassembled so you could put as much creme cheese and toppings as you'd like.   My boyfriend had the EGGS BENEDICT* (shaved ham & basil hollandaise) for $13.5. This was also not best eggs benedict I've ever tasted either. The waitress gave us a heads up about the eggs coming a little translucent which was nice. I'm assuming they have had a lot of questions about it.  The * means that it contains raw foods and may cause health hazards; ie the eggs/salmon and tomato (jk about the tomato).  Our friend had the LAMB GYRO (grilled pita, tzatziki, tomato, onion & feta) $14. He said he liked it.  I almost forgot.... I had the cinnamon roll. I ordered one and it was big enough for 3 people to share. It was delicious! It had to be the best thing I tasted there!  What I loved about this place - the decor/atmosphere/drinks, cinnamon roll and customer service. What I didn't care for - the food. Maybe I didn't order the right things but I'd be hesitant to order food there again."}
{"text":"I went to Scottsdale for a girls weekend and liked this place so much that I came here twice over 4 days! The outside patio is awesome and they have a great happy hour. All of the food that I tired was on point as well and everyone in our group liked their food. The first time I came here was for happy hour and we tried the bruschetta and truffle fries. All of the bruschetta's were bomb! Plus they were huge, split into 3 pieces, so it was perfs to share. To top it off they were $3 each. Steal! We each has the sangria and that was delish. I came back for Easter brunch a couple days later and we had the bread and pesto dipping sauce, wow! Everyone was talking about how good it was. I ordered the Mediterranean salad and it was soooo good! It was light, but filling. I even put a little of the pesto dipping sauce on top. My friends ordered the hummus, the Cobb salad, and the parfait. Everyone liked what they got. There literally was not a single complaint. Then to top it off we tried the cinnamon roll. This was super good. I only had a couple bites and we all passed it around. It's good if you go with a group to share with everyone. I definitely recommend this restaurant. It's right on the canal as well so it has great ambiance."}
{"text":"I have been a long time customer and while I used to love Olive and Ivy, I just don't enjoy it as much as I used to.  The wait staff is ok but not super friendly and the food has been just ok.  They used to bring a generous portion of bread and pesto to start and now the pieces are thin and cold...not warmed at all."}
{"text":"For the price, portion, quality and atmosphere this is great!  I recommend the SWEET POTATO CANNELLONI (sorry i had to copy and paste lol)."}
{"text":"Amazing sangria and food!! Perfect spot for lunch/dinner! Especially with groups! They are very accommodating and fun! Great vibe great good great location perfect patio in the heart of old town! On the water front how could you ask for anything better from sea on to season the entire restaurant gets better and better!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It has a huge space, but making reservations is still a smart move as the tables fill up fast. I kicked it off with a white sangria and trio bruschetta which were amazing! The server was attentive, knowledgeable about the wines and menu. I had the salmon which truly was outstanding - cooked medium. What flavor! Also ordered was the chicken pesto flatbread - quite tasty and big portion. I also enjoyed a great vino as I took in the crowd. Awesome experience."}
{"text":"Had a great business lunch there and would absolutely recommend Olive & Ivy!!  Loved the atmosphere, decor, food and most of all the service.  Our server Mark was attentive, without being obnoxious.  They serve bread with their own Pesto sauce as their version of bread/butter, it was delicious.  I had their Gyro Sandwich with a light salad and it was flavorful.  Wish I would have sat in the patio area, but was concerned that it was still too cool.  Went out afterwards to check it out, and would highly recommend it.  The interior decor is definitely inviting as well, but with the great Phoenix Spring weather the patio should be great option.  Enjoy everyone!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service was great. The food was just ok. We had heard good things and came up disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped in here quickly during a business trip and it was perhaps the most decadent lunch I've had. I love the pesto appetizer and the Cobb salad  but the real winner was the caramel marmalade dessert. I had a drink that was fig with vodka (a mixed mule) and it was divine.  I now tell people this is the place to stop at if they are in Phoenix or Scottsdale"}
{"text":"I saw the olives, however the ivy was nowhere to be seen, just like the real value.  To put it simply you are paying for decore and location, the quality ingredients do not match the prices.  We had a Veggie Fritatta $11 and the watermelon salad $10.  While it was nice that they were able to do split plates, the Mellon on the salad was not very sweet, the mint was tasteless and the chevre cream was not viscus enough to stick to the fruit.   The veggie fritata was decent, the mushrooms were a bit rubbery but the arugula and chevre were a nice touch, but was it worth $11, not really.   I did enjoy the focaccia bread and pesto that came with the meal, but that was  the high point.   The patio looked great, but with the heat and a broken misting system that was a no go."}
{"text":"Always excellent food and atmosphere.  The steak with potatoes and creamed spinach is one of my favorites in the valley.  Sitting at the bar is a favorite of mine and my wife.  They have some great cocktails and a pretty good bourbon selection as well.   Scottsdale at its best."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there last weekend for our anniversary. We had reservations for a table on the patio at 7:45. We got there at 7:50ish and were promptly seated. It was a very busy Friday night. It was one of those very cold AZ nights, so we requested our server if we could have one of those patio heaters by our table and he was back in 5 minutes with one. I would strongly recommend a table on the patio for a nice, quiet, romantic dinner. It tends to get very loud inside on the weekends and it might be good to hang out inside with friends and drink but for a nice dinner the patio ambiance is really amazing.   Now for the food and drinks - My wife got the ivy and ginger cocktail and I got the red sangria. Before the drinks came out, our server got us warm bread with pesto sauce and it was really good. Drinks came out fairly quick and I must say I loved the vodka ginger cocktail drink!! It was HUGE and had a nice kick to it.   For the food - we are vegetarians so that really cut down our options to few. Our server Ryan G. was awesome and I would recommend to ask for a table in his area. We ordered the sweet corn, red peppers and goat cheese flat bread and Ryan recommended the sweet potato cannelloni. He said the portion was big enough to share and he can even split it and get it in two separate plates for us to share. The food was out in about 10-15 minutes and Ryan was correct...the portions for the cannelloni were perfect to share and we both absolutely loved the cannelloni and the flat-bread. The cannelloni had a nice sweet/salty taste and the spinach/almonds on the top tasted amazing.   Ryan had also asked us initially if were celebrating anything and we had told him it's our anniversary. After we were done eating, he got us a delicious looking strawberry short cake (on the house), with fresh strawberries on a white plate that had a handwritten note with chocolate icing saying \"Happy Anniversary\" . We did not expect this at all and it was really a very nice surprise! The cake was absolutely delicious and it was the perfect way to end the meal.   We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night.  Great place for people watching, if you like watching boring people.  A very enthusiastic (though as we discovered later, inept) DJ was \"spinning\" near the entrance.  Got seated, ordered. Drinks came quickly, as did appetizers and entres. Everything was very good. However service was poor. Water was not refilled, we were not asked if we wanted refills or additional drinks.  We sat in a booth inside, but the outdoor seating looked great, lots of space overlooking the waterfront. B/B-"}
{"text":"While I was in Scottsdale I had a lunch meeting at Olive and Ivy.  The food was excellent as was the service and atmosphere.  I had the hummus appetizer and the salmon Cesar salad the first day.  It was so good that I came back a second time and had the wedge salad.    If you are in the area give this place a try.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ive been for Brunch a couple of times. The food is great and the staff are always friendly and personable. The space is very large with a beautiful outdoor patio as well. Nicely done!"}
{"text":"We flew on USAir and their terminal in the airport is SEVERELY lacking in food options.  Oh sure they are working on opening a few more joints this year but at the time our options were limited so we went in here.  We paid $30 for two sandwiches, 2 sodas, and one salad.  GEEZE!!! And the sandwiches were more bread than anything else but as I said, in this terminal the options were limited.  One positive I could say for them as that they got your stuff out to you quickly.  I knew we should've eaten something in the area before going through security."}
{"text":"This is a very nice place to take someone you really like on a first date. The food is healthy and they are very cautious if you have allergies. They took my nut and shellfish allergies very seriously, making sure to customize my food and prevent contamination. This is definitely more on the pricey side, but worth the quality and ambiance."}
{"text":"I stopped by Olive and Ivy with Gabi M and Andrea R for a quick breakfast in the marketplace side. I really enjoyed the coffee house/market vibe of this place, especially for such a casual meal. We just ordered at the counter, took our number, found a seat, and they brought our food out to us.  While Olive and Ivy serve a myriad of snacks, including some very delicious looking baked goods I went for a healthier option - the egg white omelet. It was served with tomatoes, avocados and a side of mixed fruit. On the day I was there the fruit was mostly melon in case you're wondering. Gabi and I also shared an order of wheat toast to round out our meal.  Andrea raved about the smoothies, but I had to have coffee since it's my favorite thing to drink first thing in the morning. And the coffee here was good - smooth and dark just the way I like it!"}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy sounds like the type of place that a basic bitch would go to get a salad. Well I'm confirming, it is the type of place that a basic bitch would go to get a salad. I guess that means I'm a basic bitch, because I LOVED the salad.   I got the chicken chopped and it was OMG totes delish! Seriously, the blue cheese, bacon, avocado, peanut granola, and buttermilk dressing combination was one of the better bowls of half healthy food I've had in a long while. It was only 12 bucks to boot!   The space itself was just as simple and awesome as my lunch. Filtered lighting from lofted ceilings and a red overtone on most of the furniture. Chic, yet approachable. The type of interior that would be cool for a wedding.   Wonder if they'll open one in San Diego soon :-p"}
{"text":"Sit on the patio during the nice months, it's gorgeous right on the water. I had the sweet potato tortellini and it was amazing. Great atmosphere, food & service. I would recommend people try it."}
{"text":"I came here for the awesome brunch I keep hearing about. It's usually pack and I was on a mini business trip so why not!  I will say this, I brunch often in Miami so I'm pretty sure the review may be bias but I'll let you be the judge of that.  Ok so service is ok, nothing extra. I sat at the bar and all the bartenders talked to each other about each other and only addressed the people when they needed something and went back to their own world. They were direct, that's the word. Direct, no friendly smile or hey I recommend this.  The food was just ok, nothing that made it different. Brunch consists of eggs, bacon, bread, blah blah nothing that made it unique. I was expecting something different, maybe in taste or maybe in presentation. But nope it was plain Jane breakfast. I may go back to try the bakery sweets but if you are looking for a brunch spot it's not this one. But a quick breakfast and maybe a sit down Quick drink go for it. I gave it 3 stars bc service was ok and the place is in a cute spot. That's it!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food and drinks were delicious. Reservations are recommended since the place is super popular and always packed. The restaurant is centrally located in a beautiful area with lots of fun shopping."}
{"text":"I frequent Olive & Ivy quite often -- almost once a weekend, in fact, since I love their brunch menu.  The food is definitely not the best, or the most exotic that can be available, but I find it very good nonetheless.    The normal routine I find most in tune with my taste is to walk in mid-morning and put my name in (I always end up waiting, though it's normally only 5 minutes, so its completely negligible), which gives me just enough time to grab a mimosa for my brunch mate and I.  The mimosa's are somewhat of a hit-and-miss, meaning the ratio of ingredients ranges depending on which bartender does the job.  Really though, they never are bad, and much better than countless other establishments I've patronized.  The food is very good in my opinion, and the pastry basket is a nice addition to any brunch, though it's definitely not for those on any sort of diet!  I usually order the mushroom omelet, which works great for any sort of low carb diet, and I am always happy with it.  The atmosphere is pretty good for weekend mornings, though I haven't yet tried a dinner here yet.  I've heard fairly good things from everyone I know that has gone, though.  The outdoor patio is somewhat of a rarity in the Valley of the Sun, which is a shame since the 8 or so months out of the year when the weather is enjoyable (they have portable heaters during the winter), the spacious patio is very nice.  There are expansive sofas surrounding a fountain, and arranged tables throughout the outdoor area.  The wait staff has been generally good, though sometimes they have forgotten to bring us water, which is honestly no problem.  If you remind them, they almost come running back with it.  Overall, I continue to come when I'm available, and definitely recommend it to anyone going into the area."}
{"text":"Another great outdoors meal at Olive and Ivy. We probably overate as we split and appetizers, flatbread AND ordered entrees. Great service and nice ambiance make this a consistent choice."}
{"text":"Atmosphere... Environment...ambiance!! It's beautiful!!! Such a chic but comforting place to dine. The menu changes and updates but I had the goat cheese pumpkin ravioli ... Very delicious. Great choice of wines. When I'm in Scottsdale I will def enjoy this restaurant ."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to come eat brunch and sit on a patio. I've been here 4 times and this place has not let me down once with food or service. Today we ordered the Mediterranean salad and bruschetta. The bruschetta choice we picked were the Brussels sprouts, avocado, and tomato/basil. The Brussels sprouts was my favorite but they are all very good. We ate our meal with a Fig Mule to sip on. That was also tasteful and not to sweet. Can't wait to come back again, don't know why I always wait to long to."}
{"text":"Loved the pesto and great flavors from the bruschetta as well.  I ordered an off menu item - green chile chicken and white bean soup. It was very tasty but very little chicken. Equivalent of maybe half a tender - somewhat of a let down.  My wife ordered the gnocchi pomodoro- which was really good.  Friendly staff and great ambiance. For Dessert we shared an awesome lemon tres leches cake - definitely recommend this."}
{"text":"I've had some very good meals at Olive & Ivy. I've had two dinners and a lunch here. This is one of my girlfriend's favorite FRCs but for me it falls closer to the bottom for some reason.   It might be the menu options not being quite up my alley quite as much as some of the others but don't get me wrong it's still a great spot. The Patio is amazing, I had my favorite dinner out there.   For an appetizer we got the artichoke hearts which were well done. Our waitress made a good recommendation on wine. I had the sea scallops which were cooked perfectly.   The inside is very impressive as well. They have a market attached which has some good stuff in it. All in all a solid restaurant."}
{"text":"Couldn't be happier when I found this place where they serve great tasting freshly prepared restaurant quality food without the wait ... at an airport!  Great selection of salad, panini and pizza at very reasonable price for a great tasting quick bite while waiting for your flight in a relaxing setting.  Plenty of seating with nice comfy benches with electric outlet underneath your seat  Free wifi  Great friendly service and helpful staff  Also serves freshly made coffee but unfortunately they're not serving it for some reason last time I was here around 7pm  It doesn't get any better than this for an airport eatery!  You can count on me otherwise your next meal here is on me!"}
{"text":"Be Careful !!    Went Thursday Late afternoon Nice Atmosphere Our Server was Angela My wife asked for a glass of house red  wine Angela said \" We don't have house wines\" She suggested the featured wine, To our surprise it was $15 for a very small glass all the wines on the menu were $7-$8 dollars  She never mentioned \"the Drink special wines at $5 at glass available We got hustled We also had the Fritto Misto To call it Very Average is being generous WE wisely didn't stay for Dinner"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants!! Their FREE (and unlimited) pesto dip and bread is amazing, as well as their appetizers and main dishes. The atmosphere is also a plus, with indoor and outdoor patio seating, both of which are cozy.   They also have an outside patio seating area which is first come first serve, however we sometimes prefer that over sitting at the tables because it is more relaxing with comfy patio furniture.  The only reason this place is getting 4 stars as opposed to 5 is because the past 3 times I have been there with girlfriends to grab some happy hour and/or dinner we have had girl waiters who were horrible (not bringing us water, having to ask multiple times for menus and bread, forgetting our food, adding things to the bill at the end which weren't ours, and then giving us attitude when we politely would tell them what we had and what the bill shows doesn't match, etc). We even had one waitress leave for the evening without closing us out, and without having anyone take over!! The busboy took care of us, and that is also to whom we left our tip with. Management needs to work on training their staff better!"}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy is a comfortable restaurant that is absolutely perfect for lunch/brunch. The food is good, not particularly great, but I'm still a fan because of its decor and atmosphere. On a sunny day, I'd recommend a relaxing boozy brunch outside.  The prosciutto flatbread, bloody mary, and biscuits were all tolerable, but I probably wouldn't order them again.  The staff is fantastic. They really go out of their way to make sure that you have a fantastic experience."}
{"text":"The breakfast club was really good, but they didn't have any iced coffee when I ordered"}
{"text":"First of all I must say the Ambiance is amazing the place has a great vibe and the crowd is great. Although it might feel as if your wallet will be empty as u walk in I must say that the food is very well priced. The staff is very helpful and sweet and the food is delicious. This probably my new favorite place to dine"}
{"text":"Great place for any occasion. Classy environment with a delicious menu. Can't get enough of their pesto! Also, if you have room for dessert you must try their strawberry shortcake bar (something along those lines). Amazing!"}
{"text":"I talk to a lot of people who really love Olive and Ivy.  It has a lot going for it that works really well:  I love the ambience.  The booths are super comfy and I like that, depending on where you're sitting, you can see the chefs cooking up something awesome with flames licking the air like you're in the most awesome depths of hell (not as punishment, more like a 1980's heavy metal fantasy).  While there are items on the menu that are pretty goddamned expensive, there's always something there that's within your price range.    I like how on the other side of the restaurant you can just order something to go deli-style and grab a bottled beverage and run in and out really quick if you've got a tight time-restraint on your lunch break.  However, considering how highly the restaurant obviously thinks of itself (it really does), the food isn't that good.  Now, don't get me wrong, it's not disgusting by any means and it's certainly not even bad.  It's good.  It is definitely good, but... I mean with the lush interiors and all the fake Scottsdale noses you see around, I'd think their food would be... better?  I'm trying not to sound like a picky little bitch, but man, when you get the fries with the burger, the fries just aren't very good, man.  The burger is kind of a standard, kind of hard to fuck up, but, y'know, it could be better.  I had their short rib sandwich and just wasn't into it.  The pasta I got another time was good, I liked it, but it seemed to me like something I would probably make myself super bored staying at home.  It's altogether an alright place.  Their drinks are usually pretty good and the service is awesome.  Three stars."}
{"text":"Love love love!!! Having no expectations I fell in love immediately, loved our waiter Tommy - he should own the place, we felt at home, relaxed and ready to eat and drink - HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"}
{"text":"This was the first good restaurant my fiance and I had been to since moving to Scottsdale from Seattle. I had a great time and the service was great. We enjoyed a bottle of wine, appetizers, and I absolutely loved their Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin. I highly recommend them for fine dining."}
{"text":"This was probably my 4th time here and I normally really like this place. The food was great - I ordered a Chopped Chicken Salad. It was delicious and the portion size was huge. However, as I was about to leave, I gave my waitress my debit card to pay for my $13 salad, and while she was processing my payment, I received an email from my bank saying that a $274 charge was put on my account from Olive & Ivy. Of course I was very concerned. The waitress came back and handed me my card saying that she accidentally slid my card for another table's order. She apologized and said she fixed it, but acted like it wasn't a big deal at all. She didn't even bother to void my $13 dollar salad, but slid my card AGAIN to charge me for that. So I had paid almost $300 for a salad. The waitress's ignorance/lack of paying attention was a huge inconvenience. I had to call my bank a couple days later to put in a claim to dispute the charges, and had to wait a couple more days to get that money back in my account.   That being said, this place could definitely use some better service. The only reason I'd ever come back here is for the food alone."}
{"text":"What can I say, Great Food, Great Service, Amazing \"waterfront\" location.  Love it and go back often."}
{"text":"Had dinner there the other day. Again - I love the design and atmosphere. Service was good but the food... not worth the $$$ they are asking for. Starting with the kids option - I ordered the pasta with marinara sauce which the server told me will have short noodles for easy pick up by a small toddler, it was made of long wide noddle, even after cutting it was not fit for a child. I ordered the grilled cheese which was okay, really not tasty as it should be.  My friend and I shared the rock shrimp which was awful, tasteless and the shrimp was not cleaned through so we had some crunchy sand like experience. Then we shared the corn flat bread which looked and tasted like airport food.  We decided to leave and got our check - for what we got paying that much was a big disappointment. They didn't even take the kid pasta dish off... $5 people... really?  I will not go back unless it is for drinks only. The two stars rating is for design, location and an okay service. Food deserve ONE."}
{"text":"I've eastern here 3-4 times and each time has been spot on. Today, I ordered a turkey sandwich on focaccia roll- outstanding   The bread was fresh and moist, meats, veggies and dressing were very tasty and not overwhelming.   Getting food in an airport can be a challenging experience - this is a reliable, we'll run and friendly place.   I travel all over the country and Olive and Ivy is as good or better than any restaurant in any airport I've been to.  Try it!"}
{"text":"After eating the fabulous sandwich at the airport, my wife and I decided to try the sit down at the Scottsdale Waterfront. Amazing in every respect. Service by Mason was attentive, helpful but not overbearing. Bruschetta had many different flavor options (we tried them all) and the bread was the cosmos tame theme holding the flavor together - outstanding  Mediterranean salad- order it! Tossed lightly and very fresh and flavorful. Salmon was cooked to perfection with delicious roasted potatoes and my wife's veal ravioli was very rich and fresh  Sorbet for dessert was a trio of delight   All in all a vibrant place to dine and enjoy a great dining experience !"}
{"text":"Someone let Sam Fox know what exactly he has with this gem right here! Over the last couple weeks I have planned a night out for my wife and I for celebrating our 6 month wedding anniversary and our first baby boy on the way in the end of October, and I must say I am extremely satisfied with Making Olive & Ivy part of the plan! My wife and I originally walked into the Marketplace side door but a worker there was happy to lead us to the hostess stand and then we were led to our table. We were greeted by our waiter Josh P. who congratulated us on our 6 Month and our son on the way. This impressed me and took me by surprise as the waiter who I have never spoken to in my life congratulated us right off the bat. He gave us time to look over the menu but never left us stranded. He filled our drinks without a hitch, never reaching over us or interrupting our conversation. Josh then brought out this amazing bread with this sauce they didn't look good off the bat but was out of this world! My wife ordered the lasagna and I ordered these awesome little pasta raviolis' filled with cheesy/creamy awesomeness. From appetizer to entree then from entree to dessert, Josh wiped down the table and made everything fresh and clean. Also during our stay one of the managers, Kim, stopped by and somehow beat Josh to the punch with filling up our drinks. I'm not sure how others feel but for me it's awesome to see a manager work on the floor and see the managment team working alongside the waiters. I wish I had pics of all of the good because it was awesome, I will make sure to return ASAP as the food, staff and environment is great, thanks Josh for helping us celebrate on a special night out! Hope to see you guys again soon and will make sure to sit where Josh will be our waiter!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Olive & Ivy for almost two years now. I bring family and friends here from out of town. The food is consistently fantastic and you can't beat that free bread with the pesto. I took my mom, brother, grandma, and 2yr old daughter yesterday for lunch. We started with the Tuna Tar Tar Tacos. My mother and brother LOVED them. My daughter ate at least two big pieces of bread and tore up the pesto. How many 2yr olds are eating pesto? really. The general consensus was that they loved the food and wished I would've brought them when they first got into town.  I ordered my favorite chicken panini w/fries. It's just too good to get anything else. Don't get me wrong, I still take a taste of everyone else's food so I know what to recommend to my future guests. That panini with the cheese, zucchini, roasted tomatoes, roasted chicken........mmmmmmmmm......so good. They also have great fries, sorry to say but second to Gordon Biersch Brewery's.  Olive & Ivy never lets me down. Great location, great seating whether inside or outside. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Really nice place and good food. Happy hour is really good just a little weird the patio division for happy hour and non happy hour. And yes regular section had a more better service as far as attention. I enjoy my self just wish services was a little more attentive I got the wrong bill for my table and then my to go meal was giving to another table. but over all is a nice spot."}
{"text":"Been here twice.  First time they were out of everything I wanted on the menu.  Granola on the yogurt parfait was soggy.  The staff is so grumpy... they need some sleep.  Skip this place if you want some food at PHX."}
{"text":"On a whim I showed up last Saturday night without reservations and waited 45 minutes for a table outside on the patio. Well worth the wait to enjoy al fresco dining on a beautiful patio. I thought the menu items overall were a tad pricey. So I decided to order the Hummus ($6) as an appetizer and the Italian Flatbread ($12) as an entree.  The Hummus had tomatoes, onions and I believe cucumber (it was really dark outside so I'm not sure about the cucumber) on top of the Hummus. An excellent combination of flavors. The best Hummus I have ever had. The Italian Sausage and Goat Cheese Flatbread was serviceable but I can't see myself ever ordering that again. The Sausage had a little kick to it but really didn't taste too great.  I'm a little fuzzy as to whether the bread that the server asked if we wanted was free. Why would you ask a diner if you wanted free bread? So that kind of rubbed me the wrong way since it seemed like some covert upselling to me. That's why we decided to order the Hummus instead of getting the bread. BTW - I only noticed one other table in our vicinty had the bread."}
{"text":"So many great meals at Olive & Ivy, but tonight was the best!  Jacob was an amazing server, went out of his way to ensure our dual anniversary dinner was a memory we will never forget.  The food is incredible, amazing ambiance, and the service is top notch.  The mushroom pappardelle was delicious, killer salmon with beets and potatoes, fresh baked focaccia with house made pesto is a must to start with. Various bruschetta appetizers are a great start.  Desserts all made in house are amazing, had lemon cake, strawberry shortcake were insanely good.  Wine list is really strong as well and we loved the bottle of Sangiovese we had.  We will be back anytime we visit Scottsdale!  An unforgettable dining experience!"}
{"text":"Everything was perfect at lunch today. The food, service & ambiance is spot-on!   We enjoyed the  Mediterranean Salad. I had a perfectly prepared piece of Salmon that was a very generous portion; my friend asked for 1/2 chicken 1/2 lamb and we devoured every bite we could.   Their bread is delicious along with the tasty basil dipping sauce as long as you don't  mind a hefty portion of olive oil."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere great food.  The wine list was the best in town.  Try the pork loin wrapped in Bacon.... yum delish."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this restaurant. We went there for an office party and the food was SO good!  The waitstaff was courteous and prompt. I love that they have the little pastry cafe for quick bites attached as well. The outside patio is great this time of year when it's so nice out. Night time ambiance is great for date night and it's not too expensive."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, even better food. The fig and apple bruschetta were both fantastic, and the filet of beef was cooked to perfection. The wife didn't really like her gnocchi, but this is my review, not her's, so 5 stars it is."}
{"text":"My husband and I shared bruschetta to start.  We enjoyed all three, but he particularly liked the Fresh Mozzarella (delicious fresh basil!!) and I liked the Prosciutto and Fig (rich, sweet, delicious!).  I had the Lasagna Bolognese with garlic bread.  The drizzle on top of the bread was so creamy with the perfect hint of garlic.  The lasagna itself was also very flavorful.  Fresh bread and pasta make a difference.  There was a lot of energy in restaurant with the lots of little groups of people chatting and enjoying dinner.  The service was also great.  Our server was very helpful with tips to help us make decisions on what to order.  We had a fun evening and a delicious meal."}
{"text":"I love this place!  You can always find something great eat.  I recently went for a friends birthday.  I would recommend their outdoor dining area.  It's a pretty decent size and you will have to wait if you don't make reservations even during the week for lunch.  We had my favorite appetizer, the bacon wrapped dates.  I love the arugula salad that comes under the dates.  They also give you bread and olive oil pesto dip.  That's a meal in itself.  We ordered the chicken chopped salad which was delicious!  We told the waiter that all four of us were going to share so he brought it out already divided in four bowls.  We also had the margarita flat bread and the sweet potato cannelloni that was to die for!  We also ordered the cheeseburger that was cut into four as well.  The server also brought out a chocolate cake with ice cream for our friends birthday.  We experienced great customer service!  We will be back soon.  Probably for happy hour since it's a good one!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a few friends before a Spring Training game! The food is sooo good! Huge portion for a decent price - especially given the high quality of food! I definitely recommend grabbing a bite and some drinks if you're on the fence about going there! This place never disappoints. Close to the waterfront and right by the main OT Scottsdale area. Be prepared for an hour+ wait if you didn't make a reservation, otherwise try and grab a seat by the bar or at he open tables outside (the ones with the fire pits on the southwest side of the patio)!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the patio at Olive and Ivy.  It's the perfect spot on the canal for a glass of wine and bruschetta. The ambience here is great, the staff is friendly, and their homemade bread and pesto dip is soooo addicting.  One of our favorite Scottsdale spots!"}
{"text":"Ate in the restaurant part. Had reservations.  Service was excellent. Server made many great recommendations  I particularly enjoyed the white peach and hibiscus margarita! YUM  I had the fish special, my man had the braised short ribs.   We also shared the antipasto appetizer platter, and really enjoyed it.  So yeah We really enjoyed this place.   I'm not a HUGE fan of their menu selections (they don't have any entree salads... the salads are all in the appetizer section of the menu and there are only two to choose from)  All in all, I like."}
{"text":"The crowd here was very mixed: I saw twenty-somethings all the way up to retired people. I think that goes to show that there is something for everyone here. If you can, try to sit outside; the view of the river is so pretty, and there are plenty of heat lamps if you're feeling cold. Shared a salad, flatbread, and a crostini which was more than enough food for two. The salad was awesome and the short rib flatbread was delicious. The ambiance outside is very serene and great for conversation."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast/brunch.  We came here after climbing Camelback Mountain; needless to say we were very hungry.   The food didn't disappoint. We ordered off the brunch menu and shared our dishes. My wife had cinnamon french toast; since she is not a big fan of cinnamon, they were kind enough to keep the topping off. It was still a great french toast, especially with the fruit compote on top. I ordered the Homestyle Cheddar Biscuit (with scrambled eggs and sausage gravy). It was a home run - I highly recommend it.  The interior space is amazing. Also, this place is right by the Scottsdale waterfront, so it's a very nice setting. Go here!"}
{"text":"This is pretty simple!  Cute looking girls working there. = 1- * Food is really good, especially breakfast, = 1 - * Has a decent selection to choose from, = 1 - * Since the location is in a airport terminal, its going to be busy. However the line goes pretty fast, = 1 - *  With the size of this place, they really try to have enough seats, = 1 - * Now the negative, price us to high. I can only imagine what their lease is. And they are going to take advantage of TSA taking away your 99¢ water, only to charge you about three dollars for the same bottle of water. Biggest scam around. = -2 - * Understand the reason for the prices, still doesn't mean it's right."}
{"text":"Loved the food, location and service. At reception desk we arrived and announced we needed a table for 2 - hostess said do you have reservations (2:00 in the afternoon), we said no, she said will be about 30 minute wait for inside seating or we could sit outside we choose outside seating and it was just lovely out on the patio actually best seats from my point of view. Overall nice place, decent food and drink good vibe."}
{"text":"Apologies for the delay, but I was here the Thursday before Super Bowl weekend.  I came here with a group of 10+ people and immediately gathered at the bar.  Considered a table but thought we were better off at the bar, since we weren't sure if our party would grow as the afternoon, evening and night wore on.  That was smart of us, since the group did grow substantially in number.  Drinks were pricey, but for the venue it was to be expected.  Atmosphere was fun, we did what we wanted, the hostess staff was absolutely adorable and sweet.  Around 5 they started charging cover ($25 a head!), so one of our friends (whose wife had been with us all afternoon) would have had to pay the cover to get in, but luckily I was able to (drunkenly, I might add) persuasively slur my magic to build a valid case, and my friend got in without having to pay.  We had a great time and had front row seats to the 50cent party entering the 944 village right across the way."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for Olive and Ivy just because I have had a fantastic time here, every time I have come. With my fiancé, girl friends, and solo when I'm taking myself out to a fancy date :P. The ambiance is everything- I really like the music, the lighting, the décor. They have a nice bar with two TVs,and across from it,little community tables which are all open seating. The restaurant is quite large and there's plenty of seating inside and outside as well. The view whilst sitting outside is really pretty- they often have lights, you can see the bridge and canal, etc. The crowd is all ages- I love that everyone dresses up and makes an effort- whether it's families with toddlers, first dates or a group of friends. On weekends I think they have a DJ. I typically always get the all natural chicken and lamb meatballs- they're delicious. I've tried the flatbreads, and other chicken (can't remember the name) those were all good too. Their deserts change but all have been really delicious. The wine selection is ok, beer not so much, but the cocktails are pretty tasty. They also have a bakery/market at the other end with gelato. The bathrooms are always clean and the service is good. My only complaint is that they've started being a little stingy on their portions- dining in and take away. The wine pour is also small! But overall, still my top few places in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and while I have never been overly impressed I have always been satisfied. Came recently with my family for breakfast/brunch and got the eggs benedict (my favorite breakfast). The eggs came out perfectly cooked with just the right amount of hollandaise sauce. The flavors were good if not spectacular. I did really enjoy the potatoes as they were a bit more flavorful then normal breakfast potatoes.   I also had a bloody mary (little hair of the dog from the previous night). It was not as spicy as i liked but well flavored and had plenty of vodka to do the trick.  If you are looking for something in the area stop by and try it out. Like I said you won't be blown away but odds are you won't be let down either. Also sit on the patio if you can it's pretty nice out there."}
{"text":"I was here last Sunday and I enjoyed it so much I decided to come back a week later. Last week our server was kind and attentive, fun and informative about the menu. Her name wast Nicki. This week not so much..... Our server is cold and distant and a little bit rude. He didn't even say hello he just stared at me until I ordered a drink. When he cleared our carafes, he just stuck his hand out so we'd hand it to him. I didnt even want to order anymore food because he was so short with his responses and his attitude made me uncomfortable. I would mention his name but he never bothered to give it to me.   Hopefully if I come back I get to sit with Nicki again, because she was absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar on a Tuesday night.  Bartenders were simply not attentive in the least--it was not busy.  We had an open tab and wanted to drink and eat!  It was like pulling teeth to get their attention and get an order in.  Had to ask for utensils and coasters for drinks.  Just not what I expected."}
{"text":"Overall, wonderful!  Great food.  Loved the sangria.  Amazing outdoor seating by the water when the weather is nice!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time for my birthday. My gosh was I surprised. It was lovely there.   They have indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor part has benches and lounge chairs. So it is a casual Atmosphere right along the waterfront.   Pesto and bread to start is amazing. We asked for more servings. It is addictive.   Got two big meals that we couldn't finish. But the food was excellent!!  Then some gelato for dessert. Absurdly fantastic.   I have zero complaints about this place. It is one of my favorite places in Scottsdale. I'm going to take family here soon.   Just make sure you make a reservation because it gets busy!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after shopping for a drink and snack.  What a great place good food and wine. Our server Marissa made the visit great!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast sandwich (the breakfast club) probably the best I've had in awhile. The oatmeal we could do without, it was too mushy with no texture... Taste was good though.  blueberry muffin was delicious! We do recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Beautiful place in Scottsdale. Quite a busy place. Waiter was very nice and helpful in ordering. Had several small plates and wine. Good selection of wine."}
{"text":"Always great food and a fun atmosphere!  Wonderful outdoor area, when the weather permits.  Great cocktails and appetizers.  Also have been there for lunch and it is also great!"}
{"text":"A nice fox restaurant in a great location. The food and service is fine, atmosphere is great. No stellar dishes but no clunkers either. Overall, it is a fun time out."}
{"text":"Super! My 1st good meal in Phoenix ! Sigh ...come with family so Chinese food everyday..sucks...  Good as it said ..highly recommend...  The braised short rib pizza PB&J smoothie"}
{"text":"Been here several times, and enjoyed it every time.  They have a very good pesto sauce.  Last time I had the veal ravioli, and it was very good.  Great atmosphere and happy hour."}
{"text":"Food and wine were amazing!  My fiancé and I were on a Saturday night .. it was really full so it took a long time to get our order"}
{"text":"We went to Oliver &ivy for a late Sunday brunch. The place was spacious and airy with lot of sunlight. They have beautiful patio seating as well. We ordered Bloody Mary and peach Bellini for cocktails which were top notch. They give you bread and pesto sauce to go along which I really liked. The bread literally melts in your mouth. My husband and I ordered pesto flatbread and lamb gyro. The flat bread was delicious and lamb gyro was okay, which we could have passed it on. This place was a recommendation and surely didn't disappoint"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome - beautiful! Food is very good but not great. Service can be a tad slow since there's a lot of real estate to cover - it's a very large restaurant. Parking can be challenging so allow time during peak hours."}
{"text":"My sister and I are GF vegan and vegetarian respectively. The menu had a pretty broad selection of foods that catered to both of our dietary restrictions and was AH-mazing. We sat on the patio - which was beautiful - had excellent service and a very delightful evening. Highly recommend to anyone checking out Scottsdale waterfront for the first time or looking to try a new restaurant  We had the charred artichoke hearts w goat cheese and the asparagus bruschetta for an appetizer. She had the beet salad and I had the sweet potato cannelloni for dinner and we shared the PB mousse for dessert. Literally nothing we ate was even the least bit dissatisfying. In fact it was beyond delicious. Every last bite."}
{"text":"Stopped by while scrambling to look at all the options for a quick cold sandwich.  Saw this place had a pastrami sandwich and that went out the window.  Accepted them to warm it up on the panini press.  The guy I ordered from seemed more interested in going back to train his coworker than me, but I don't need to be coddled so that's fine.  A young lady picked up where he left off and I told her I wanted a potato salad and let her know about the sandwich order. Add a water and it was 15.75.  It's the airport I knew I wasn't getting off cheap.  To the food.  When they brought out the pastrami it felt warm, but they just warmed the bread the meat was still cold.  Still tasted good.  I've had Grocery store potato salad that tasted better.  So for food and service it's 2 stars but at an airport it's 3 ."}
{"text":"Delicious food and a wonderful patio. Many items to choose from on the menu. Great service"}
{"text":"We visited this joint.  He ambiance was nice.  The food is good but not great. Service was excellent.  We had a burger that was charred , my wife complained even though we had eaten most of it. Next thing we know the manager is over and asking how they can fix it.  We said it was fine since we had eaten most of it. They gave us a free desert because of the charred meat patty."}
{"text":"First time here and cant wait to come back! My friend and I sat on the patio and enjoyed some sangria's. Loved the atmosphere and the little touches, the place is beautifully designed and very relaxing as it over looks the soleri bridge. The service was excellent and the bacon wrapped dates are a must try!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 7:15pm. Got there at 7:20. Was super loud!!!! Was told I could be seated and then given a pager and told it would be a 5 minute wait. 30 minutes later I still wasn't seated and I gave back the pager and left. WTF?  Why make a reservation if it is meaningless??? I'm over overrated noisey overpriced Fox restaurants. Bye bye"}
{"text":"Nice open restaurant with large patio - not exactly as billed (more like Southern France than southern Scottsdale) but still not too bad.  Casual crowd, good sized bar and area, inside/outside dining, noise level was average.  Staff was attentive to our needs, so much so that the manager checked in to see all was well - NO ISSUES on service.  Wine list is not bad, has room for some expansion.  My margarita was good my colleagues enjoyed the sangria.  Food, again good.  Not top notch but no issue.  To me Olive & Ivy is a nice everyday restaurant.  I would go back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"I doubt that I'm cool enough to be a regular but that doesn't stop me from frequenting the place so that I can enjoy their date/bacon appetizer.  God bless happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Private room dining was nice, Mediterranean salad was great super fresh and flavorful; roast chicken in wine reduction was perfectly done, service was attentive. It was loud in the main dining room so this is probably not the spot for intimate conversations etc."}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy, though somewhat hidden in the mix of Old Town Scottsdale and Scottsdale Fashion Square, is a popular restaurant frequented by 50-somethings trying to look like 30-somethings and 20-somethings showing off all of their 20-somethingness. The sunglasses are big, the shopping bags more expensive than I can afford over a lifetime and the tans as dark as they come.   The atmosphere is swanky and there is often a Jason Mraz wannabe playing his music just inside the door. I've been seated, at one point or another, in each room of the restaurant. The red room in the rear near the pizza oven can be a bit tight but is a nice choice if you want to hear each other from across the table. The main dining area can get pretty loud - but it makes for great people watching. The white room has a lot of appeal with its large chairs and high cloth-draped walls. The problem is, as I was seated here for a client dinner, is that the humongous circular table creates a yelling match across the tables. Don't make any important business deals here. Maybe it would be better for a bridal shower. Eh. It's cool looking.  The waitresses are attentive and deliver drinks and pesto and bread dip in a timely manner. The bread/dip combo is delicious! I would go just for that if I could. I usually order the flatbreads. My favorite is the prosciutto with arugala. Delicious!   Olive & Ivy also has a cafe/market that is great for lunch. If I'm feeling simple I get the grilled cheese which is always satisfying or I get one of their delicious sandwiches.  Overall a great place to eat and be seen, a perfect combo for Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here today and asked for an indoor seat. We were seated very quickly at a very nice table. Ambience in this restaurant is really nice and the decor is really classy. The food was very tasty; however, I have to say the best part of the whole dining experience was our server, Josh. He was super friendly and very attentive to detail.  He gave us the best sellers and answered all the questions we had about the menu.  I will definitely come back to Olive and Ivy when back in town and I hope I am able to request Josh as our server!!! He is definitely an asset to the restaurant!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favourite restaurants in Scottsdale. I come every time I'm in the area for a meal. On a warm evening, it's lovely to sit outside in the garden along the canal. A great place for groups or a romantic meal. I've always enjoyed great service and food at Olive and Ivy. My personal faves are their pesto sauce and truffle fries."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Today was my second time here. The first was a dinner meal and it was one of the best dining experiences in a long time. Today was happy hour, with drinks and appetizers and it was equally as lovely. Love it. And definitely recommend."}
{"text":"One of My Favorites!! Olive & Ivy always offers great service, fresh ingredients and delicious ways of preparation that impress the palette!! I love the patio at night with the twinkle lights. My daughter, husband and I throughly enjoyed her last evening in town dining while enjoying the canal views! We shared nibbles and also shared desserts so we wouldn't over indulge. All our choices were fantastic and the desserts were out of this world ! Our server was attentive and made the evening enjoyable with helpful suggestions as well!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place while living in Phoenix. And now it's a staple every time I'm back for a visit. In fact, it's the only place my girl's and I go for brunch when I'm back. There's not a bad word I could think to say about this place.   I love sitting out on the patio during the summer and sipping one of their Mimosas. Nothing bad about it."}
{"text":"If this review was about the ambiance, service and the margarita it would rate higher.  Al 3 were great. But I was pretty disappointed in the menu selections.  Didn't match up to what we found online which is what ultimately drew us here.  Like I said the décor and ambiance are fantastic.  Really beautiful place.  Nice outdoor area but it was all reserved when we came.  Busy place.  My margarita was very good.  I had a hard time picking from the menu because honestly nothing really appealed to me.  And the few items that did kind of get my attention were way too pricey (I was on per diem).  I didn't feel like flatbread so I ordered the chicken which had mashed potatoes and mushrooms.  Chicken was OK and was a pretty large portion.  Mashed potatoes were pureed so very creamy and delicious.  The best part of the meal.  My friend went with the Margarita pizza which she found tasty enough but really settled for because she couldn't find anything else on the menu.  I will be traveling a lot to Scottsdale for work in the near future and I may return for a drink and maybe an appetizer.  Just not wowed by the dinner selection."}
{"text":"My son thought his pastrami sandwich was awesome and, most importantly, they were ridiculously nice to us at this airport location on Christmas Eve."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar.  Food was fine. Service was lame and nonattentive.  The outdoor patio are is nice overlookimg the river and crowded."}
{"text":"The service was incredible and the food was good. While the dinner selections were under portioned and over priced everything tasted fine. I sampled the lamb meatballs, beet salad and a variety of their bruschetta. Olive and Ivy makes a delectable apple martini that was strong yet refreshing. Unfortunately I cannot recommend their cactus blossom cocktail, it was too sweet and had the flavor profile of a mikes hard lemonade.   Lastly I have to say bravo to the front of the house staff working on the night of my visit. Fox Restaurant Concepts have mastered the art of customer service and for that reason I'll be returning here.  I'll be back again soon and am looking forward to  trying their breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch at olive and ivy at the bar. The blood orange Paloma and it was delicious. I also had the chicken sandwich with fries with no peppers. It was not super flavorful but it was still pretty good. Overall a good experience"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! The food is yummy too. Not the five star dining experience but fun!"}
{"text":"Actually tried to hit this place up twice, once for drinks and then again the next day for breakfast. Drinks were a failed attempt. It gets super busy, I would suggest making reservations or getting there early. Breakfast was awesome. We had no reservations but you can actually self seat on the right hand side of the restaurant as you walk in. Awesome view of the canal. No real tables, but I was so excited to get a seat, I didn't really care. Breakfast sandwiches are great and nothing can beat a pitcher of white sangria for brunch."}
{"text":"I love everything about this concept. And the flatbreads are so good. My only complaint is the bacon cheeseburger lacks flavor all around. But other than that.. Perfecto !"}
{"text":"Very good service. We had a party of 8, including an infant, and someone who is allergic to eggs and dairy - it was no problem. The food was wonderful. Modern looking inside. Had a gelato bar inside, which we didn't try because we brought cupcakes for someone's birthday. And I kept hearing how cool the women's restroom was. The one cocktail I had, ginger-something, wasn't my cup of tea, but food, etc. was great. I'd recommend to anyone, and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Bruschetta (pumpkin and kale) = excellent Bruschetta (mozzarella) = excellent. Lamb gyro = so so  Misto frito = good but not great  Service = so so"}
{"text":"This place was just okay. I'm giving it three stars even though the food was disappointing for a few reasons: Busy, buzzy atmosphere in the oh-so- trendy Scottsdale waterfront area. Good service. Our waiter was on top of everything and just a good guy.   This is full of rosé-swilling, avocado-toast eating, romper-clad millennials. I actually like a good rosé and avocado toast, but it wasn't our scene. Lots of bachelorette parties the night we went.   This is a good place for people watching, fun to go with a group. Not great for a date, I wouldn't think. Menu is mostly unremarkable flatbread pizzas and salads.   I might go back for lunch sometime?"}
{"text":"The Olive & Ivy is a really cool and lively place set at the Scottsdale Waterfront.  There is a huge shopping center with trendy shops and restaurants all around.  My party of nine started with a round of drinks out in the Patio area which is beautiful with comfortable big chairs. The place was packed Thursday night and happy hour in full force. After a round of drinks our large party made it to the table and onto the food, we sample different apps like the fritto misto and bruschettas which were pretty good. I had the Piccante flatbread which was delicious and filling. Everyone else also seemed to enjoy their food as well.  For dessert, it was the raspberry sorbet which was good.   The service was great, our server handled the large party very well. Loved the atmosphere and vibe here, I would return."}
{"text":"This is a 3 1/2 rating really.  I have been here a number of time for drinks and dinner.  It's a fun place, busy on weekends, and good people watching.  The beet salad and filet medium were what I order this last time around.  Both tasty and above average.  The others ordered the steak and bruschetta I believe.  Everyone seemed happy with what they ordered.  Not the best meal of all time but good food, nice decor, healthy ambiance, and decent service.  The patio is nice any time of the year.  Although funny, because they consider the water behind it to be water front as though it's a river.  I don't think so.  I looks like all of the typical SRP water tributaries in the area.  It doesn't hurt certainly but water front - NOT.  Anyways, go there for a late happy hour and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Olive and ivy has always been one of my go to spots. The bread they give you with pesto and olive oil is a great way to start your meal.  If you're feeling really good,  get the bacon- wrapped dates.  I have yet to have a bad meal here whether lunch hour or dinner and they even have a nice market inside making it quick and easy to pick up something on the go."}
{"text":"We came here on Valentine's Day weekend. I love how open this restaurant is! Their patio is adorable and it has nice views of the canal at the waterfront.  The bruschetta and our entrees were delicious. We got 3 different kinds of bruschetta as an appetizer, I got the scallops as my meal and my boyfriend got a chicken dish. I wasn't crazy about the smores dessert though.  I think this is a great place for people watching if you sit on the patio. Great place for people visiting from out of town too!"}
{"text":"While in Phoenix during thanksgiving, my friends and I decided to try this place for lunch. This places is in a cute neighborhood in Scottsdale just overlooking the water. Also, there's a lot of free parking in the garage next to it.  As we were on vacation, I decided to go with a pretty strong drink (whiskey sour smash) during lunch. My friend got the red wine sangria but sadly it did not taste fresh and she switched it with the strawberry and thyme cocktail and that was pretty good. We got the hummus to share and it was very tasty and I got the sweet potato cannelloni for my mains. The pasta was very thin and cooked perfectly and the sweet potato stuffing complimented the buttery sauce extremely well.  I think this place is definitely worth checking out if you like an extensive menu which is diverse and a great place that overlooks the water!!"}
{"text":"Visited here two times during our two day stay in the area!  The atmosphere is amazing.  I don't think there could be a better place to hang out.  The restaurant is beautiful, inside and out.  The staff was very professional.  The first time, I had a gyro.  I can't tell you that it was the best that I've ever had because I'm not sure why there was humus on it, but it was good.  The pesto is amazing that they give you for the wonderful bread.  The lamb meatballs are worth going back for too!.  They were awesome.  My husband had a pasta dish that he loved.  I need to come back and try the gelato!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I really wish I could live in Scottsdale. I met up with two girlfriends there and we had a great time! This visit was a solid 3-4. We went in to take advantage of their happy hour (if you don't the prices seem wayyyy to steep for me). Anyway, if you take advantage of their happy hour you must sit either in the outside patio or the lounge. Now the outdoor patio was beautiful! Prettiest outdoor seating I have seen ever. But not when it is 104 out. (and there are no misters). Why did we sit outside do you ask? Because the bar area (which is tiny) filled up super fast (duh. its yummy!) The indoor ambiance is beautiful. (a little dark) The most awesome lights ever are in there. The service was good and the location is nice (right next to the free parking too!)  I tried the featured white wine, and whatever it was (sorry I forgot) was good! My friend tried the sangria, but I was not a fan. Weird flavor compared to most sangrias that I can't describe.   Now onto the food. People who raved about the flatbread pizzas...I have no idea what you are talking about.  I had the margharita and it was just not good. Soggy and flavorless. The hummus was very yummy. Needed more pita with it. Now onto the star of the show: the bruschetta. The vine ripe tomato is yummy. The apple caponata is just as yummier, and the prosciutto and fig was also excellent! Ohhhh so yummy! This is the place to get bruscetta and wine after a long day."}
{"text":"It has been years since I set foot at Olive & Ivy mainly because I had been distracted by life's other attractions.  A friend reintroduced me to O & I this past weekend and I couldn't believe how much I had been missing out.  It's just an authentic, large but quaint space.  From inside to the outdoor patio, all you can see is happiness and tastiness.  We were a rather surprising, large group of chatty women but Mark, our patient waiter, served us graciously.  Olive & Ivy, go there for a happy time."}
{"text":"Best meal experience in Scottsdale. The service, the flavors, the quality, the portions and the overall ambiance was outstanding. We will certainly dine at this gem if we happen to pass by Scottsdale again.."}
{"text":"I will definitely return!  -great location (across from Nordstrom at Scottsdale Fashion Square) -lovely atmosphere with great outdoor dining area  -pesto/bread dip was great -cheese platter app was delicious -scallops were perfect -good service"}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere. The small plates are delicious and they have a great selection of wine. Perfect for a date night."}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment. I went here because of all the stellar reviews on Yelp. Yelpers-- you steered me wrong.   I ordered the eggs Benedict. The description said it had shaved ham and basil hollandaise sauce. The waitress made a point of telling me that the \"over easy\" eggs would be very runny. Ok...Well I thought it was odd that they weren't poached, but went with it since I know Benedict includes a runny egg--It is part of what makes then delicious. I was also eager to try the bread since they made a point of mentioning that all their bread was baked in house. Boy, was I in for a big disappointment!  The Benedict arrived. It was two Thomas' English muffins with deli meat ham and the basil hollandaise was just sauce garnished with basil. The eggs were not runny--they were raw. I mean the egg whites were raw!  The waitress seemed startled when I sent it back, but was truly great about it. But...I think you can guess what happened next...It came back with over-cooked eggs...think hard boiled! At this point, I was starving, so I just went with it. The waitress noticed that I wasn't eating much so she didn't charge me.  So...I give them 5 stars for service, but 1 star for food.  I will say that it is a nice setting and I would go back for a drink, but not much more.  Thank you to the stellar wait staff for somewhat redeeming the experience!  That being said, I was just visiting the area so I won't likely be back."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale for the first time, who knew it's a foodie mecca!  Yay, I was thrilled!  My good friend Teri recommended this spot.  We walked in and were impressed by the gorgeous lighting and spaciious layout.  But my eyes were drawn to their ultra chic patio!  Too bad it was freezing outside, but we were seated in a nice warm spot.  They do have a great happy hour menu, I wish I had grabbed a drink at the bar first to take advantage of those prices.  I ordered the Butternut Squash and it was rich and fabulous.  Their focaccia bread as a starter was the bomb, we asked for a second serving!  I heard this was part of some Fox restarurants, so I definitely want to check out ther other restaurants."}
{"text":"We came here for a late dinner. The hummus was wonderful...tasty, creamy, and full of delicious flavor. Service was wonderful as it always is in Scottsdale.  The beers on tap were also great..we had the Sedona hefe and Santan porter. A little on the pricy side but good food nonetheless"}
{"text":"We went here at the suggestion of our son to celebrate his 21st birthday last December.  We were a little disappointed that they didn't accept reservations and that we had to sit hear the entrance and lounge but other than that everything was just fine.  The service was very good as was the food and drink.  We all had a memorable time.  I would like to return again sometime soon."}
{"text":"After strolling along the Canal Convergence Light Exhibit, we were ready for our 8:15 dinner reservation a little early but they graciously were able to sit us at 8pm.   The bustling bar with the staggered Edison style glass lighting hanging from the chic adorned ceilings and a DJ to my right reminded me of being in Vegas. I nudged my hubby with surprise, \"Wow! The music sounds just like the playlist I listen to when running!\" It was pop hits remixed with house and dance music. So lively and energetic. Ladies were dressed to the nines in high heels and beautiful dresses. Couples snuggled in close at booths and at the bar. The older crowd appeared to coincidentally find themselves enjoying the inviting patio where the music was still present but not as loud.  Our table was nestled between the patio and the main room. It felt like the best of both worlds because we were so close to the patio with the open glass doors yet behind another glass wall away from the \"bustling\" main area.   Although my hubs did not want to go exactly with what the waiter recommended, we ordered the exact bruschettas that he talked about, because hey, apparently we all share the same taste in food!! Prosciutto and fig. Manchego and Spanish Chorizo. Butternut squash, goat cheese, and pistachio.   Bry ordered the bouillabaisse. The broth was amazing. What can I say? I managed to taste a clam with some broth but he basically devoured the rest of the seafood mix before my very eyes.  The Prosciutto and Marscapone Tortelli was what my eyes fancied since I first looked at the menu online for some reason. After tasting it, my taste buds were so happy. It could be because I'm partial prosciutto but when matched with Marscapone. That's just ridiculous. Butternut squash and pearl onions added varying textures and complemented the tortelli.   We didn't need dessert, but we ordered it. Bry enjoyed the thin mint gelato which of course was inspired by the season of Girl Scout Cookies. Awesome gelato. My sweet Apple dessert had super red apples glazed in sweet thick syrup, so evil, it was. I was a moo and slowly battled eating those apples, spongy type cake and vanilla bean gelato.   Don't worry. I was able to wash it all down with a pitcher of red sangria.   Our waiter was super attentive, friendly, and informative. The food was great. Another Sam Fox restaurant has won me over. Darn it!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and had the same thing both times. First of all, the decor is really awesome and although it's a pretty big building, it's not crowded and they don't put in unnecessary tables. I had the buttermilk pancakes with caramelized bananas and it was amazing. Before your meal they bring out a focaccia bread with a pesto dip. The service has been very attentive both times and I would love for them to expand and open more locations."}
{"text":"Make a reservation!  We knew this place was good, because as we darted over to the only available lounge table, we saw Charles Barkley walk out!  I tried to be cool about it, but failed.  I also failed being cool about the complimentary fresh focaccia bread and pesto they bring out, because the waitress brought us another round.  I ordered the gnocchi with duck confit, and it was absolutely stunning.  I tried telling my husband it was terrible, but my face betrayed me...he ate half.  Which was OK, because I got to eat half of his dish, which I remember as some sort of seafood with risotto, and the best-tasting cherry tomatoes I have had, outside of my grandmother's back yard.  Then, we ordered three scoops of very good gelato from their counter (for only $5!).  Oreo cheesecake gelato?  Yes.  Excellent food, top to bottom, and not as expensive as it could be.  Please go, but again, make a reservation."}
{"text":"The environment is great.  I love their food.  The mushroom flatbread is delicious! White sangria is good and strong. My server was nice and kind. She checked on us every 5 minutes. My glass of water was always full. Great service, great food. Great place to go."}
{"text":"Agree very hard to locate, but keep looking so worth the hunt. Food is fabulous and so are the drinks. I wanted everything on the menu. No doubt every trip I make to Scottsdale there will have to be a visit to this place."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of going to O&I for brunch recently with the gang... O&I has mimosa specials, but not bottomless like some of the other spots in town, and I'm guessing that's how our group of 6 didn't have to wait for a table at 11am on a Sunday.   I was in a breakfasty kind of mood and after MUCH debate, I decided upon their buttermilk pancakes which came topped with caramelized bananas and sliced almonds. The bananas and caramel were so good, I didn't even need the syrup on them... I used it on my breakfast potatoes instead!  hehe ... I ate every last morsel of my food, drank my specialty cocktail (something with gin and grapefruit juice, yum) and all for $25 including tip.  All in all, O&I is a solid joint. It's not overly crowded and is a nice spot to catch up with friends on the patio or enjoy drinks with your special someone.  Note: O&I does have a happy hour, but I have not yet taken advantage of it. I'll put that on my list!"}
{"text":"I stumbled on to this place while rushing to my next flight, I didn't have too much time but needed to eat something, so I tried this place.  I ordered the French Dip and a salad, I have to say it was pretty good.  They also have a great selection of pastries that I didn't try but they looked pretty tasty.  Next time for sure :-)"}
{"text":"The location is first class being located on the Scottsdale Waterfront and directly south of Fashion Square Mall. I also like the fact that I can walk around the corner to see my buddy who is the GM at the #Scottsdalewaterfronttowers.   The ambiance is good and you can tell that this is a tourist hub for those catching the AZ during the discounted summer months. My meal was good and the wine we selected fit perfectly into the mix. I was only there for lunch with friends from Napa, so I need to come back with Twyla and catch this place at dinner. There is a full bar for those who wish to get their IV drip of alcohol moving into the infused direction; you know who you are...  Once your meal is completed, you can take a romantic stroll along the waterway and then venture around to the many various shops for coffee or dessert. Not that Olive and Ivy doesn't have a good one. However, I could use a good walk to burn the many calories I take in on a regular basis. There are so many things to see and do in this area. I do recommend checking it out with the whole family.   #vino2 #vino2ultimate  #vinosquared"}
{"text":"The food is trendy and the drinks are cold and strong! Great location, great staff. I have been there three times and have always eaten on the patio-there is usually an art show or something going on, and you can put your name in and they will text you when your table is ready. I plan to go again soon!"}
{"text":"Just got a free meal tonite because the manager thought I waited to long ... appreciate the initiative!   Sandwiches were great!"}
{"text":"This was my second time dining there and my third time there altogether (the other visit, I had cocktails.)  I have to say, when I went 4 years ago, I was very unimpressed with the eatery. I felt like it was overpriced for the small portions served and way too dark. You might think that's romantic, but judging by how loud it gets, it was a weird dynamic for me.  This dining experience was far better (despite our server taking more than 10 minutes to greet us.) He made up for it by suggesting items on the menu and being diligent the rest of the night, and the atmosphere was a little more relaxed than I remember. What stands out most to me about the decor is the sprawling wine bottle display that goes up to the ceiling. I also like the pretty hanging lights and big bar that greets you as soon as you walk in.  For my first course of my meal, I had the hummus and pita bread. I wasn't a huge fan of the pickled onion on top of the hummus, but the hummus itself was good. The pita bread was a little dry, but it was nice to have a healthy option for a starter, and overall, I enjoyed it.  For my second course, I had handmade pasta, and instead of the veal ragu, I got a butter parmesan sauce to make it vegetarian. The sauce was so, so good, and you should request it, too.  For dessert, I had a coffee creme brulee with hazlenut biscotti. I really liked the taste of it, and it was so creamy, but I found it sort of odd that our table sampled many desserts, and they all came out in perfect circle shapes. It made me think they were all pre-made, and that was a turn-off.  Overall, though, I was very satisfied with the meal, though Olive & Ivy can get pretty pricey for average-quality food."}
{"text":"Great for meeting up with friends and family, or celebrating birthdays. I enjoyed it when I went there, but the price is high... Like appetizers are double digits price. The food quality does justify the price because the food was good. I had the ziti... I think. I was definitely stuffed when I left there."}
{"text":"I'm adding one more update to my review. As I've mentioned before, the Mediterranean Chicken Salad is my favorite salad on the menu but while dining with my Mom I learned a helpful tip that makes the salad even better. Yes it is possible to make it better! Instead of having the salad with the cold chicken, ask them to substitute it with the hot grilled chicken sliced on top. It changes the salad completely and makes it an even better meal!"}
{"text":"OI has the best patio in town.  I love their sweet potato ravioli.  It has a different name, but that's what I called them.  I love their GM, she has come by our table almost every time we were there.  This place is a great place to relax, and it is very well ran."}
{"text":"What a great place, the atmosphere was wonderful and the staff was informative about the food options and substitutions available due to my good allergies. Very helpful!"}
{"text":"I really liked the ambiance and the setting for dinner. I thought that food was just average. I ordered the lasagna for dinner and I thought it was a little flat....and kind of dry. I ordered the hummus dish with vegetables and that was really good! It had a little kick to it, but I liked that! The \"Mediterranean\" inspiration was a little hit or miss in my opinion. My friend got the bruschetta, and it was good but not the best I've ever had. There was a lot of bread!!"}
{"text":"My co-worker took me here because we were in the neighborhood and she knew that I really like the Fox Concept restaurants.  The place exudes a fun atmosphere.  The food was fantastic as well.  I started out with the beet salad which was really good.  The dressing was tasty, they provided an good amount of beets, and I appreciated the pistacchios for the textural contrast.  The beet salad was almost as good as the one at the Arrogant Butcher.  We also partook in the lamb meatballs which were yummy as well.    For the entrée, I chose the scallops at the recommendation of my server,  The scallops were of good size and seared on one side, but I would appreciated it more if they were seared on both sides, however.  The scallops were accompanied with scallops and sweet corn polenta which went well with the protein.  I ended the night with the chocolate mousse with cherries which was absolutely divine.  My server was friendly and attentive and it was a great overall experience."}
{"text":"This place is great if you can handle waits. First on a waterfront in AZ. Ok it's only a canal but gives you atmosphere. Second you eat with your eyes first so peruse the deli while you wait. Third decor was very eclectic. A lot  of ideas for the home.  Let's get to the good stuff. Menu drinks did not impress. If you have a fav I'd order it. Next the bacon wrapped dates were yummy! Salads we delivered quickly. Our meals comprised of the spicy shrimp risotto and big eye tuna was excellent. The dessert menu was simply, but I'd head back to the deli for a pastry and to people watch."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. I love their salads... so good. This place is awesome for brunch. Grab a seat outside and enjoy the view."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials with all wines at half price, appetizers at half price and flatbreads at half price.  The wine list was a full page and included all the wines; not just house wines at some places.  I have had better bruschetta at Postino's but the flatbreads were good for sharing.  If a lot of people showed up there would be a definite space problem on the inside. There is a half booth and three half booths with two chairs each in the bar area.  The bar itself is square with more than a dozen cushioned bar chairs.    One could eat on the outside but who in his \"right\" mind would want to sit on the patio very long in the never ending summer heat,,, yeah sure, it is a dry heat but not for long..."}
{"text":"Poor rating is for phone service. I work on the waterfront and eat at olive and ivy almost every day. And I've never felt the need to complain. However it seems to take almost 10 minutes to put in a phone order anymore. I was left on hold today for 7 minutes before I hung up. I called back only to be asked to hold for another few minutes. I briefly explained I had already been left on hold and I only have so long on my lunch break to eat. I was finally given a person to take my order, and they let me know it was too late to order from the lunch menu. It wouldn't have been, had it not taken so long to get someone to take my order! They stopped serving lunch 10 minutes before I was given someone on the phone. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Really glad we made a reservation here when we visited Scottsdale a few months ago.  The restaurant is really beautiful!  Great place for a nice dinner with good friends or on a date.  Would have loved to have been able to eat out on the lovely patio, but inside was just as nice.  We went on a Friday night, and there was an awesome house DJ spinning...which automatically gets you points in my book!  Wine and cocktails were good and most of the food was as well.  They have a fantastic caprese salad with avocado that I dreamed about for days, but the fish that I ordered (the special of the night) left a lot to be desired.  Overall great place.  I'd definitely go back if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I'm so excited to have found them reminds me of back home!!! everything is delish!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Brandon was wonderful on bar. Creative,  friendly,  patient.  Server was fantastic,  very knowledgeable,  able to make suggestions. Seabass salmon and ahi were amazing.... as was the gelato. We had a great time, party of 5."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for dinner while we had a friend in town. We had about a 30 minute wait for an inside table so we decided to grab a seat at the bar and get a drink. My girlfriend ordered a glass of wine, my boyfriend ordered a vodka/tonic and our friend ordered another pretty easy drink. I ordered the white sangria and the first sip was off-putting a bit. It tasted like sweet and sour mix was added. I had a few other sips as well as my girlfriend and boyfriend and they both agreed it wasn't right. We asked the bartender to just make me a vodka/water. Much better.   We were seated right at the 30 minute mark. Since we were not too hungry for all of us to get entrees we decided on some small plates to share. We decided on the Lamb Meatballs, Bacon wrapped Dates (two orders of those), an order of 3 different bruschetta, (Prosciutto & Fog, Fresh Mozzarella & Manchego), and our friend ordered the chicken Cesar salad. Everything was great! The service was also great! Friendly waiter and came at the correct times during our meal. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Cool Atmosphere, Good Service, OK Flavors, High Price For Serving Sizes..   So we decided to. check this place out last minute for a little treat thinking it was the same as IVY down in Chandler. We got there to realize this is a different place.  atmosphere is cool, and the location is nice. Overall vibe is good.   We ordered One of the flatbreads and it was good, but kind of high priced for the almost nothing that was on it...   We ordered next the 3 piece bruschetta and were surprised at how small the serving size was. The salmon lox was more of a patte/paste rather than tasty salmon on top. It was not bad, but its only a couple tiny bites and it is gone. We order this type of food often and there is usually a bit more for serving size.   The complimentary bread and pesto is the best part as it is actually DELICIOUS! But nobody every brought us refills for it so most of the tasty goodness was lost to the garbage due to no more bread....   All in all there is nothing exceptional about our experience here other than the atmosphere. Meager portions of the bruschetta are pretty unappealing and the flatbread just didn't have much going on..."}
{"text":"I love this place as it's very beautiful on the inside and outside. There an outdoor patio that overlooks the canal. The big bar inside serves delicious happy hour bites and drinks. I love everything I order every time I go. My go to it their Mediterranean chicken salad. Definitely a must if you're in old town!"}
{"text":"The servers here can vary from great to not so much. One time we went for brunch and got our coffee AFTER our food which was about total 25 minutes. The coffee of course was cold and the waiter never took it off the bill. Brunch is seems the wait service is not so good. Lunch however the servers have been great and the multi colored beet salad with goat cheese is hands down my favorite. Get it every time. He sweet potato cannolini is to die for. So delicious as is the ravioli ---   Oh and the lemon pudding cake with burnt honey ice cream. A++++. Never thought burnt and ice cream together would work but it's melt in your mouth amazing. I Haven't tried the gelato in the market yet but that's on my list for next time. The outdoor patio seating here is the best atmosphere and right along the canal too adds too it."}
{"text":"This restaurant was suggested to us by the gal at the Roaring Fork, as they were not open for lunch. I had the turkey sandwich, it was like having Thanksgiving between two slices of bread! It was awesome! The staff was engaging, not taking offense to our preoccupation with trying to figure out why some people got white napkins and some got black napkins. Turns out their white napkins are \"linty\" and they have had people complain, so they give out black napkins to anyone with dark pants on. Why anyone would complain to a restaurant  about lint on their trousers is an entirely different question. This place has great ambiance too. Check it out!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is very nice, and the waiters & waitresses and super friendly and attentive. Great food. The focaccia bread they give you when you're seated is outstanding. I thought the food was quite good, although the portions were a bit small (even though I did not order for the small plates menu). I ordered the grilled scallops with asparagus. When it came, I was a bit shocked to see 3 scallops and the equivalent of one asparagus sliced into 6 long strips on the plate. Not what I was expecting, but still quite good. I didn't need all the food anyway, because I stuffed myself on the focaccia bread earlier."}
{"text":"Very hip place right on the waterway on #stetsonRoad in the very cool town of #scottsdale. Large open space. Big bar. Both Indoor/outdoor areas are enticing. Good music playing. Beautiful people popping in and out.    Good sizes for salads and entrees.  We had the Cesar salad with salmon and ravioli. Both good. Split for no fee."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today ( a hectic day it was ) and eating here was just the pick me up i needed .  Service was friendly,  and my chopped chicken salad was delicious. I was pleasantly surprised that i liked the buttermilk dressing as i am usually not a fan, it really complimented the avocado, blue cheese ,bacon,  and chicken.  it is a very nice spot for lunch."}
{"text":"I can't say enough. These guys are fantastic and very consistent. It's probably my favorite spot for lunch. Yesterday, my wife and I went in and our server noticed we are having a baby very soon. Our experience was already great but I was impressed when he bought us an incredible desert just to say congratulations."}
{"text":"We shared the Kale salad and tuna sandwich and they were both amazing!  Service was great and patio was perfect on this day!"}
{"text":"Their brunch is outstanding! I love the mimosas, the cinnamon toast, the croissant sandwich and want to try more! I cannot wait to go back. It is a classy establishment that has a great enviornment!"}
{"text":"This is my ideal dining experience and favorite Fox restaurant, hands down. O&I is absolutely wonderful. Even after a scorching summer day, the patio offers a gorgeous tuscan ambiance with a canopy of well groomed trees, expertly placed misters, strung Edison bulbs, and an overall understated elegance. So dreamy.  That's all you really  need to know, but I'll humor you since you're reading reviews for a reason, hm?   Bruschetta sampler: Prosciutto/fig, Manchego/chorizo, Apple/Brie All of them were delicious, though the prosciutto one was hard to eat due to the meat not having been cut...the bread was cut into thirds prior to the meat being added so we had to remove all the arugula and cut the meat, then re-build the app. That was weird. But the flavor was A+  We drank the white wine sangria, which packs a punch thanks to the brandy, and the cactus blossom cocktail. Both were great on a warm summer evening.   Seabass: though I did enjoy it, I wouldn't order it again. It was well prepared but I prefer fish without the gray meat as it tastes a little gamey...Again, just my preference. The sides it came with were small, but good. The few pieces of \"caramelized\" cauliflower left something to be desired as it was closer to just roasted cauli, but the candied grapefruit and snap peas were perfect with the mild white fish.   Filet Mignon: served with horseradish potatoes & red wine shallots--stole the show, without a doubt. Nothing to complain about here. My husband ordered it rare, and it came out with a lovely charred crust and warm red center. Beautiful. Plate envy for sure.  Cheesecake w/ stewed peaches: Decadent and delicious, and certainly enough for two after all the food we'd already had.   Roll me out and valet the car, dear. I am deliriously happy.    PS - the bathrooms are rad."}
{"text":"Just overpriced bland airport food. Nothing special to eat here. Had the Italian grinder, took them 10mins to toast a premade sandwich. It tasted ok. Tried the meat pizza, was all dough and dried out meat chunks on top. Maybe the salads are better here?"}
{"text":"Sweet Potato Cannelloni...literally the best item on the menu. Second is the Mediterranean salad. Order both. This place is amazing. The atmosphere and service are always great! Ask for Josh P when you go, he's native to MI and has always taken care of us. I'm serious about the sweet potato cannelloni. It's heavenly."}
{"text":"this place has been on the list for years, and finally after getting our act together, we met another couple for a dinner at Olive and Ivy.  the decor, in traditional Fox style, is perfect. from the lights to the tile to the bathroom...even the servers are perfect looking. speaking of service, our waitress had this very laid back, comfortable air about her, but with confidence. she made some suggestions as we were ordering which were helpful. we had to ask a few times for water glass refills though.   the drinks were splendid. i had a rum honey martini and it went down way too easily. the sorbet in the drink was fantastic. for dinner, i had the sweet potato cannelloni. the pasta was soft, the sweet potato just a tad softer....it was seasoned perfectly and the sauce drizzled was a mix of sweet and savory. my wife had the mushroom tortelli and i tasted a bite and i love that earthy smell/taste of well done mushroom dishes.   i couldn't bare desert but they all sounded delicious. the only other dish tried was the salmon and i thought it might have come from a picture cutout is was so beautiful.   a great evening out with some great food!"}
{"text":"The pesto was GREAT! The rest of the food was Meh and the service was the same. My girlfriend and I went here. We are both in our 20's. They seemed to not want to help us. We asked for ketchup when our food came and they didn't bring it for 20 minutes. We were finished eating at this point.   If I ever go again, it would be for happy hour and pesto but I won't be buying more plates."}
{"text":"The manchego bruschetta was amazing! Would definitely go back to try more if their dishes."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for brunch and dinner but if you're looking for a nice brunch spot with great prices and not insane wait times, go here. It doesn't open until 10 on the weekend so there is usually a short wait because every other Scottsdale native is waiting 40 minutes for breakfast club or some long line down the street. I highly recommend their mimosas ($6) they're huge and they actually fill your glass with good champagne, not just orange juice. The Mediterranean salad is my favorite dish and their hummus is my favorite starter. If you're looking for a quick breakfast, check out their market next door! Dinner is a bit more expensive and I don't recommend the paella only Because the rice was undercooked last time that I was there. Park at Nordstrom's lot across the street."}
{"text":"Underwhelming!  Not even 1/2 the lamb in gyro for $15!  Crazy silly to cheat on the meat."}
{"text":"We came to Olive & Ivy on the last day of my boyfriend's vacation and it made for the perfect ending. I can't compliment our server, Tim, enough for his excellent customer service. We went with lamb meatballs, hummus, and the fritto mizzo (sp) appetizers and were blown away! My boyfriend owns restaurants in California and it takes excellent flavors, textures and quality of food to make him happy. He was so impressed with everything (especially their beer) and we couldn't thank Tim enough for his wonderful attitude and lovely approach. We would have stayed to thank his manager but his flight was leaving in an hour (we got way too caught up with enjoying our dinner). I'm hoping the manager will see this review and thank Tim for his selection in food, beer and being the best waiter we had this weekend!"}
{"text":"Our server, Amanda, made the experience great.  She was very conscience of our needs and had a glowing personality.  The beet salad, cauliflower cheddar soup and chicken scallopini were tasty. The pasta used for the veal ravioli was too thick."}
{"text":"Average chain... really nice outdoor area - really average food."}
{"text":"Pizza and sandwiches are VERY overpriced. A lot of bread but not much else.    This place is just average airport food.  Salads are on the high side of airport food prices but not outrageous like the pizza.... Salads are also nothing special."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our dinner. I read some reviews about this place, and with another positive encouragement from a local, we checked it out. Cool vibe both inside and out. We sat outside near one of the fire pits close to the river  The staff was fantastic and accommodating especially our server Taylor! We were there on Easter Sunday, so they had a limited menu for the late afternoon while they switched from bunch to dinner. We asked Taylor if she could ask the Chef if he could fire up a steak for us even though it was an hour before the regular dinner menu started. She asked and came through for us. The steak was a perfect medium rare. We substituted the standard veggies for mixed veggies and they are cooked perfect as well. Taylor's service along with the food made a fantastic ending to the last day of our vacation.   The wine list is a medium size, but they have a nice selection.  Thanks again to Taylor and the staff for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy is one of the best low key places in Scottsdale! I've been here probably 8-10 times and it never disappoints. To start off with, you get fluffy bread and their homemade pesto which is amazing. I could probably just eat the pesto with a spoon and call it a night! Lol the bruschetta is also phenomenal! They have a choose 3 for $11 (I think) and all the options are great. My favorite is the prosciutto and fig, sweet but salty. Least favorite is the asparagus, just not as flavorful as the rest. For the entree I usually get either the Mediterranean salad or the natural chicken. The chicken is so moist (yeah I said it!) and delicious! I've eaten here with other people who said the flatbreads, lasagna, bacon wrapped dates, and porkchop were delicious. I should also mention this sweet potato dessert I had once. I HATE sweet potatoes but our waiter got to talking about how good it was so my sister ordered it and OMG, the best dessert I've ever had. I think it was seasonal . The ambiance and decorations here are also very inviting! Last but not least, you can dress up or down and blend in. Not your typical downtown Scottsdale 6 inch heels and mini skirt place so everyone can feel welcome!   I'm salivating typing this! Just made reservations here for din tonight :)"}
{"text":"Very busy place, but so worth the wait! Sam Fox has done it again! Wonderful service,  food is excellent and the wine menu is epic! Beautiful wine cellar over looking the bar, such a nice place to chill at the bar or have a full dining experience. One of my favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend went to try Olive and Ivy for our anniversary dinner. Let me warn you that both me and my girlfriend woke up with upset stomachs after dining here. We ordered three different types of bruschetta and a duck tortelli plate. I am not too sure how this restaurant has almost five stars as this restaurant served the worst tasting mediterranean food I have ever tasted before. Olive and Ivy is a sad excuse for a high end restaurant with inexperienced chefs that do not even know how to cook food the right way.  Apart from the food horrible tasting food, the restaurant staff was very nice and friendly. If you are looking for good mediterranean food, save your money and go to Pita Jungle. Try to avoid restaurants owned or managed by Fox Restaurant Concepts. This is the second restaurant that I had been to managed by Fox Restaurant Concepts leaving me unsatisfied and with an upset stomach the day after. It seems that management tries to cut costs by hiring young inexperienced chefs serving low quality food."}
{"text":"For the record we did not eat here but I cannot wait to try it out!   As we were walking back to our car from strolling through Old Town we stopped at Olive and Ivy for a beverage and bathroom break.  I went with the tropical ice tea and it was AMAZING and unsweetened!   While poking around the market side I decided I needed to use the restroom. Okay so the next time you go, you HAVE to check them out! They are so unique! Huge doors dark woods and a really cool sink! No worries, I am not one to make a big deal about restrooms at all (unless we are talking about the freaky doors that fog up at TAO in the Venetian in Vegas) but they are just really cool and add quite a bit of character!"}
{"text":"AWESOME atmosphere and great food, but a bit of advice to the wait staff and bar staff...Enjoy your job or find another... TWO glasses of ice tea sent to me with lipstick on the glass...EWE.... I am in the industry for too many years myself and know that this is an on going pain in the but issue, but it is not going away anytime soon so JUST CHECK THE GLASSES ESPECIALLY AFTER THE FIRST ONE WAS SENT BACK!    DISGUSTING and So disappointing the way the help did not seem to care!  C'MON!  Take pride in your role!!!"}
{"text":"First time at Olive and Ivy, second time in Scottsdale. I visited a year ago for a dirty ass bachelor party that did not entail beautiful brunches and extravagant dinners haha.   Great ambiance, attentive service, trendy, and a great effin food. We had the prosciutto cudo flatbread which had the obvious, Rosemary mashed- like potato, basil, and a sunny-side egg on top. We also had the lamb gyro which was really really tasty and the portions were extremely generous. We are both fatties and walked away more than satisfied. I highly recommend both dishes. As for the drinks, we had the bloody and the greyhound. Both were super good and strong. Check it out!"}
{"text":"It is decorated beautifully inside and has a cool ambience. They give you an amazing pesto sauce with bread as the \"free\" appetizer while you check out the menu and wait for your meal. I went for brunch and ordered the egg sandwich with the egg cooked over easy as the waiter told me the egg could be cooked any way I like. I don't eat meat, so instead of the bacon I asked for more avocado (which the sandwich already comes with). When my sandwich came, the egg was not cooked over easy, it had ONE LITTLE sliver of avocado, and way too much mayonnaise. My sister couldn't decide between ordering a margherita flatbread or the Funghi Trifolati flatbread so our waiter suggested she do both. The Funghi Trifolati was the best part of the meal, and I wish we just ordered a whole one. We had the chocolate cake with the toasted marshmallow for dessert, which sounds yummy, but is actually just more of a challenge to eat the \"hard-to-cut\" marshmallow."}
{"text":"Amazing place, a friend suggested and we loved it, not only was the food delicious but we were very impressed with the server, was very attentative and very helpful.  The spinach ravioli was delicious and the scallops dish was excellent.  Had the chocolate cake for dessert and unfortunately it did not match the quality of the place would not reccomend."}
{"text":"My girlfriend suggested that we come here for brunch and I'm glad we did. The whole layout of the restaurant is nice and they did a great job with the decor.  It was a bit odd starting with bread and pesto and then eating breakfast but that's what you get when you sit down and the pesto was just so good! As for my meal, I had the french toast which came with delicious compote and warm syrup. This was probably the best french toast I've ever had that wasn't home made. Add a side of crispy applewood smoked bacon and I was in heaven. If I only come back to Olive & Ivy for brunch I'll be happy but I hope to make it back for lunch or dinner sometime as well."}
{"text":"Is my favorite patio in scottsdale!! Great ambiance. Nice servers. The Mediterranean salad is delicious!"}
{"text":"Review for BRUNCH only:   I thought this place was a great brunch spot.  Dined here with 11 other girls and we all enjoyed it.  Great ambiance, relaxing, inviting, and open.  Service was wonderful too.  The homemade foccaccia with pesto was scrumptious!  I think a lot of us filled up on that before our entrees were served.  Some of the dishes ordered: cinnamon french toast (yummyy!!); flatbreads (tasty); frittata (not too heavy, eggs cooked right); egg sandwich (pretty good); steak and eggs (wonderful!).  A few people also ordered drinks and I didn't hear any complaints.  In the front of the restaurant you can also order pastries and they have gelato too.  We were too stuffed to try any but everything looked good."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I always order the veal raviolis OMG TO DIE For. And the bread is so dam good. All the drinks are yummy yummy. I also had their brunch and it's good too. Especially the breakfast burrito.   I love the patio area and how it over looks the canal. Such a beautiful restaurant. It's a total Date night place. Customer service is awesome. Always."}
{"text":"food turnaround was very, very fast.  as for the breakfast food here...best airport grub that ive had in some time...  selection of pastries and breakfast items was impressive...price wise...well, its an airport...so we wont judge based on that...BUT the food made up for it...  they happened to botch one of our orders and brought us out a new one shortly...the customer service here is very good...very good management...very well organized  best breakfast i had in arizona during my trip was the breakfast sandwich i had at the airport...how awesome is that?"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on Saturday. This place gets busy so definitely use Opentable to book reservations. There was a DJ serving up jams. The ambiance was nice & the restaurant is definitely posh. We had a bottle of Prosecco which was crisp & smooth. We ordered the lasagna...AMAZING! Every bite was fresh & flavorful. The bread & pesto they offer the table is also tasty. I can't wait to try other options on my next visit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in Olive and Ivy. I ordered the chicken salad and about halfway through I noticed that there was not any chicken in it. I was eating at the bar and mentioned it to the bar tender and she just seemed to shrug it off. She did not offer to bring me a new one or at least some chicken."}
{"text":"I've been eating here on and off for years, and always enjoy returning to see the menu changes. The patio is my go to, every time.   I don't usually write reviews (see all of the one review I've written previously), but the service tonight justified the effort. Brandon was, without a doubt, worth the time put into this. He recommended great options, and answered all of our questions thoughtfully and thoroughly. We were incredibly indecisive on wine, and he made great suggestions - in several different price ranges. He was even quite patient waiting for us to make our final decisions in both wine and food.  Bruschetta was yummy, as always, and the scallops were tender and delicious. Finished off with the (well recommended) blood orange sorbet.   What a wonderful night, and thank you to Brandon for making it so."}
{"text":"Definitely sit on the patio. Creamed cauliflower soup was excellent and the bruschetta is so good. The bread is slightly toasted but not enough to make it difficult to eat. Lasagna was excellent. We will go back again before we leave Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This review is solely for their marketplace in the entrance:  I have frequented the marketplace during lunch many, many times when my work bring me to Scottsdale. You can't go wrong with their pastries (chocolate croissant, cupcakes, cake) and their salads are to die for. Every single salad is delicious, even the simple green salad which I like to order with tuna salad on top. And the additional grilled chicken breast you can get as well is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here. Love the look and feel for this place. They have a nice patio, so its open. The food is mouth watering. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went to Olive & Ivy on a Saturday night.  Had a reservation and wanted to push it back by 90 minutes to enjoy a long walk on a beautiful evening, and they were very accommodating.  The place is very spacious, both the indoor and outdoor patio, so don't think it would ever be a long wait for a table.  Ambience outside is great.  Close to the \"water\" in Scottsdale, and in the spring it wasn't too hot to sit outside.  Service was very good and the menu is outstanding.  Kind of a tapas place with many entrees as well.  We had the bacon wrapped dates, lamb meatballs and kale salad with bacon.  All very good.  Want to go back to try the Spicy Shrimp Risotto.  Very good drink menu as well.  I had the Whiskey Sour Smash which was very good (though on the strong side, so if you order it, make sure you like the taste of whiskey).  Will be going back to try other dishes, menu was very appealing."}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy is hands down one of the best restaurant experiences I have ever had. The staff there is totally synced and on top of everything. THE FOOD... is amazing. Especially the bruschetta! The drinks are also all amazing and I enjoyed their selectively crafted menu. On top of that the decor and music and energy of the inside and outside is beautiful and perfection. This is seriously a can't-miss destination.   (Shout out to the best bartender ever Jameca)"}
{"text":"I like the patio more than inside .. The wine menu is really good .. This place is nice for breakfast and dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our 10th anniversary. Every single thing we ordered was amazingly delicious! The server was so nice, and made it a special evening for us. They even gave us free dessert to celebrate our special night, with 'Happy 10th anniversary\" written in white chocolate on the plate. We loved sitting out on their beautiful patio, but the inside is just as beautiful too. If we are in the area again, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So glad I finally had the chance to try Olive & Ivy! I have had it bookmarked for forever it feels like ha. Was looking for a place to eat brunch in downtown Scottsdale that wouldn't be super crowded on a Saturday morning, and this was the perfect spot!  When we got there, the front area was like a little cafe, you could get quick food there, and they had some tasty looking pastries and gelato up front, yum! Loved the look of the place too, and how you can see them making the food and all the fresh ingredients and everything. We kinda had to look around for where the hostess was, but someone helped direct us. We were seated quickly, and everyone working there was super nice! I usually never order anything other than water, but the cinnamon roll latte totally caught my eye and I had to give it a try! Also they brought out bread and pesto for us to start and it was so so delicious. Everything tastes super fresh. My latte was a little rich so I couldn't drink too much, but I shared it with my mom and sister and all three of us were obsessing over how amazing it tasted.  The brunch menu is pretty small, but there's definitely something for everyone on there! I got the vegetable scramble. It was pretty good. Vegetables in the scramble were cut chunky which I like. The potatoes were phenomenal. My sister got the burrito and liked it. My dad got the sandwich, and my mom got the two egg plate. She asked for spinach to be added and our waiter said yes but for some reason they put it on the side! Our waiter thought that was strange and offered to have it fixed, but it wasn't an issue. Wasn't too crazy pricey either. I would love to come back to try lunch or dinner here, it was great!"}
{"text":"If you ever find yourself walking into Olive and Ivy, especially if you're on a first date with a pretty young lady; by God you better hope Clenard Hardy walks into your life. Let me briefly tell you about my evening on June, 30th 2016 as its one I sincerely appreciate and won't forget! It's started with an off menu personal creation of his own, which you have to ask him about if you have the pleasure of his service. It was one heck of a recommendation that I'd gladly wheel my grandmother to the side to enjoy again. Also, I assume he has some sort of magic crystal ball in his pocket because his timing was impeccable. The entire experience was effortlessly enjoyable. Thank you Clenard for aiding me in a fantastic evening with a beautiful lady."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance here, and love the food. The staff is super friendly. If you come here for brunch on a weekend, be sure to make a reservation in advance, as the wait may take hours. Seating is open in the patio area, but it's definitely hard to find seating for a large group, given the awesome view of the Scottsdale Waterfront, and the appealing atmosphere. I always make sure to come here everytime I'm in town."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this location and we just had to check it out. In terminal 4 near the A gates, we walked over from the southwest side of the terminal, thankfully all the gates are connected once you get through security. We caught breakfast before an early flight. Everything was super fast and efficient, and about as pricey as anything at the airport. Two breakfasts with coffees for $20. For airport food I was pleasantly surprised, just don't expect a typical O&I breakfast. The key to airport restaurants with the high volume and people in a hurry has to be premade and an assembly line. Despite that, it was worth to to have a non fast food breakfast in an upbeat atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Olive and Ivy... yum!  Just before I came to eat dinner here I happen to be Yelping and Jessica F. quick tipped trying the sangria.  I was late meeting my party of 6 so as I sat down and the waiter took my order I knew I already wanted the sangria - red.  It reminded me of a Framboise I tried at Carly's Bistro, very tasty and fruity, I had two.  The décor was amazing!  The window coverings were plush and the light fixtures were industrial.  There wasn't uniformity to it but it all came together so well.    Upon recommendation from one of the attorneys I was dinning with, I ordered the braised short rib with mascarpone polenta & baby vegetables.  Before the meal arrived the server gave us steak knives but they were useless.  The meat melted like butter and tasted even better.  I had never had polenta before but when I tried it I realized it was basically grits.  I don't particularly care for the texture but I couldn't stop eating them.  And the vegetables were two baby onions and two baby celery, meh, they didn't add anything to the meal.  For dessert I tried the blueberry gelato and it was typical gelato, a great way to end a meal.  Another one of the attorneys had ordered the stuffed ricotta balls and they reminded me of the doughnut holes from Dunkin' Donuts.  All in all, it was a fabulous meal and great company makes the dining experience that much better.  As for the service, I wasn't impressed.  Our server had all of the decorum of someone who worked in fine dining but we rarely saw him.  The dinner lasted two and a half hours and that was mostly because we had to wait so long - wait for drinks, to have our order taken, to get our meal, to order coffee and then dessert, waiting for the check.  Then when we did receive our meals, three people had ordered the same meal but one ordered it with pureed potatoes instead of the polenta.  When the server didn't know which was which he asked them to take a bite and then he switched their plates!  They of course insisted their $26 meals were taken back to the kitchen and corrected.  I wanted to give four stars based on the food but the service lead me to knock off a star."}
{"text":"A definite favourite. Incredible food (in particular the sweet potato cannelloni), perfect atmosphere, wonderful service, and probably my favourite outdoor patio to date. It's great for all occasions whether it's date night or dinner with the girls. Highly recommend this place - I rarely give 5 stars. I've been here multiple times and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Great place! Make sure to make a reservation as they fill up super fast. I really enjoy their bruschetta, you can order one or multiple of the different choices. My favorite is the avocado one. Their shrimp risotto is amazing! I've tried recreating at home and can't quite get the flavor down. The gelato is ok, I've had way better. Great service."}
{"text":"This rating is based on first experience on a Saturday around 8:30 pm. We did not have a reservation. There were four of us in our party. They use the OpenTable system. If you're planning on a weekend night, I suggest you use it. This was a very busy night.  We're not taking into account the 50 minute wait for a table. That was completely our bad for not making reservations (it was a last minute thing) and our desire to sit outside (even longer wait) as it was very loud and crowded (this seems to be another regular occurrence with Fox restaurants: they don't architect enough sound dampening to handle their capacity and they encourage standing room only at the bar with very loud/upbeat music (there was a DJ). I believe this is within their control, but they merely wish it this way.  Fox Restaurant concepts has a knack for creating restaurants with a 'hip' atmosphere and a certain kind of clientele in mind. This was my first time here but my fifth Fox Restaurant visit. I'm starting to notice the ingredients/entrees are 'shared' across Fox menus. This can be a good thing as mainly these items are fresh and of high quality.  We ordered 3 rounds of drinks, appetizers, entrees, and desserts. We kept a lively mood as we were good friends who hadn't seen each other in a while. Three of us had previous restaurant experience.  Sam Fox stresses \"outstanding hospitality every time\". There are little things good and bad not worth noting. They're just what you'd expect on a busy Friday night at a popular place. That being said it would have been 'outstanding' if that kind of thing you expect everywhere else didn't apply here.  Overall the food was very good (the sweet potato canneloni was noteworthy as well as mushroom soup du jour). However the service and pacing are what killed the experience for all of us.    When disappointment was expressed in an item he was not apologetic, in fact he was downright combative: \"Oh, I know I said there would be 10 meatballs, but these were the last ones for the night. (there were six small ones). There was no offer to replace them with something else.  \"It's a Sicilian tirimasu I TOLD you it would have citrus flavors (there were overriding orange flavors). Again, no offer to replace the item. Then of course the strange insistence he had on setting items directly in front of someone who was speaking, obscuring their view of others (a simple wait of 30 seconds would not have been disruptive), but the lack of urgency to clear the table end of meal when he was nowhere to be found and empty dessert plate sat until even after the bill was taken.  How can I write this in such detail? Because while we all tried to converse, catch up and ignore his faux pas it became harder and harder to do so until we burst out in nervous laughter. We ended up poking fun at his strange actions to keep things light. As I mentioned we'd all worked as servers so we just shrugged it off, gave him his 20% and chalked it up to a poor luck of the draw. We didn't complain to the manager or give him a hard time because he's just trying to make a living (and we didn't want the night to end on THAT note), we just all shook our heads and pondered if he knew why he probably wasn't do so well as a waiter.  I know Fox concepts wants a guest to have a great time, come back and recommend their places, but it also takes friendly service. Hospitality as Sam Fox defines it.  Even if there were a bunch of mistakes, friendliness, humility and a desire to please would have gone a long way with this group. He would do well to have more training, better quality control (why would an item go out less than promised/) and to retain employees of greater dedication and character.  We'll probably come back, but if we see this guy again, we'll definitely request someone else."}
{"text":"Went with my friend on a Sunday night. It was really easy to make a reservation on their website through Open Table the night before, but we didn't even need one. The place is huge, and we were seated right away.  The service was beyond 5 stars. The server was very nice and attentive. Food came out very timely and they kept filling our water even though we stayed there for a while to chat. They never complained or seemed like they were pushing us out. On top of all that, the waiter brought us 2 separate checks without us even asking!  I got the scallops and I was obsessed with every part of the dish. Some of the best food I've had in a while.  Would highly, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"YUM! I always love coming here.  Breakfast is fantastic (HIGHLY recommend their Yogurt and Granola Bowl), Lunch is wonderful (Try the sea bass w ravioli) and Dinner is great as well (sangria anyone?).  This restaurant makes you feel like your not even in AZ with it's gorgeous patio on the canal and plush sofas.  This is by far one of my favorite places to come with my girlfriends or alone and enjoy the atmosphere.  The service is always top notch and knowledgeable.  I highly recommend this place for drinks, dinner, chatting, munching, wine, breakfast, deserts, people watching, lunch and atmosphere; amongst other things...Enjoy yourself whatever you choose to do. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great service, superb food, and fun drinks. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"My second visit to Olive & Ivy is what convinced me. Not that my first experience wasn't spectacular. It was, but I really steeped in it my fiance this weekend for brunch, and it isn't that our meals were just perfect, it's that the service was very friendly and attentive, as well.   My fiance ordered the Eggs Benedict with breakfast potatoes, and I had the Bacon Cheeseburger with a side salad. He cleaned his plate, and ate whatever he could of the half burger I couldn't finish. His only comment was that he preferred the hollandaise a different way, but that's because we make it ourselves at home.   The Bacon Cheeseburger was amazing, I order it medium. If I could have finished the entire thing I would, and the red wine vinaigrette on the side of greens is the best I've had in a while. I'd love to be able to make that one at home!  We ended the meal with the strawberry shortcake dessert that was interesting...not what either of us was expecting, then again, not sure what we were expecting. It was good. I'm sure there are better choices.   Our waiter really made sure we were comfortable, enjoying our brunch and our experience. We walked out of there smiling, stopping by the marketplace to order the large Cactus Blossom iced tea on the way out."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time to have dinner with my girl friends and I have to say it is  such an amazing experience. The place was lovely decorated on the inside and a nice patio area . Lights are dimly lit that set a warm romantic feel. Matt was our waiter, he was so welcoming and so attentive. Was very helpful when asked for opinion on what we should order since it was our first time there. Their flatbread was so delicious and couldn't have had enough of it. All the entrees tasted delightful, even the desserts were awesome . They even had a ice cream bar with many different and cool flavors! Prices was reasonable I totally recommend this place and would for sure be coming back for more date nights with my girls!!!:)"}
{"text":"A MUST!!  The patio seating is so comfortable and cool and shady.  What a wonderful place to relax on a Sunday afternoon .... or any afternoon!  The food was very good as well.  Try the \"Prosciutto Flatbread\"!  It's amazing!"}
{"text":"Great place to come have a drink or lunch/dinner!  They have a big outdoor patio along the river w/ heat lamps. Offer a happy hour menu.  Bartenders do a nice job making drinks.  Menu has lots of choices for all types of eaters.  There is a DJ in the evenings..not sure if it's all evenings but for sure Friday and Saturdays."}
{"text":"Right on the river near the fashion district in Scottsdale. The outdoor seating is pleasant but the river view is block by a wall and vegetation. Midday they give you a limited menu then tell you no meat or fish is being severed. We got an appetizer plater it was OK but a lot of bread and nothing was special. There is a lot of unique dining options in this area, I don't see any reason to return."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic experience here a couple of weeks ago.  We sat at the bar for lunch, as the restaurant was crowded during Spring Training, and tried all of the dishes our bartender recommended.  Everything was delicious!  I will definitely be returning here again soon, probably for dinner next time."}
{"text":"This place used to have a pretty good atmosphere and fun crowd. However the last two times I've visited, my experiences were pretty bad.    A couple of months ago I had a rude bartender too busy chatting up some guys to take my drink order, it was like she intentionally refused to take her eye off her dude and acknowledge me in the hopes we would give up and go away.  When she finally asked if we needed anything she got my drink wrong.  I ordered a vodka & soda with a splash of grenadine and she gave me a vodka & 7up.  Of course it was SUCH a hassle to remake it the way I asked that I got the bitchy eye roll and sigh.  The last time I was there a few weeks ago, my friend and I were told we had to leave the couches we'd been sitting at for over 30 minutes because all the tables outside were reserved. We stayed at the bar inside for at least 30 more minutes and never saw the patio get even half full.  In addition, the flat bread we'd ordered outside got \"lost\" when the waitress couldn't find us so we had to order again.  We finally got our appetizer about 45 minutes after we first ordered and it came out burned.  Gee, thanks.  It's a great space, I love the decor, and I really wish I liked it as much as I used to.  But the food, the service, the crowd are all just \"Meh\" now; what a waste."}
{"text":"We met some friends who just moved to the Valley at Olive and Ivy last Tuesday night for some drinks and food. For a Tuesday night it was really crowded, but I attribute that to the Insight Bowl being the next day which prompted an event nearby that brought many people to the SFS area. We were the last in our group to arrive and we were at a small table near the bar area - definitely if you have more than three to four people, get a larger table! It was still cozy and chic...loved the ambiance and feel of Olive and Ivy. One negative is that it does get very loud, so hearing the person across the table from you can be a challenge at some points.  Our server was very nice and helped us make some drink selections. The sauvignon blanc she recommended I get was excellent. I had the pesto flatbread which was delicious...it was the perfect size I thought. Chris had the proscutto and fig flatbread and he liked it, although he said he could have preferred a little more goat cheese and a little less fig. I also had a caesar salad, which was average - nothing to rave over. Our other dining companions enjoyed their flatbreads as well. Our group's only complaint was that the timing of the service of the food was off...our friends had ordered the calamari appetizer and I asked for my salad to be brought out first and our flatbreads arrived first! A minute later, the calamari and salad were brought out...it was entirely too much food for our little table, but due to our ingenuity we made it work. Our group of five's bill came to about $160 which included four flatbreads, a salad, calamari and a handful of drinks.  They do offer valet, but with the parking garage at Nordstrom's so close as well as the Waterfront parking garage, I am not sure what the point is of the valet. Olive and Ivy is definitely a place I see myself returning to meet some girlfriends for drinks or a place to eat lunch while out shopping at SFS."}
{"text":"The best date night restaurant you can ever go to! The bread and pesto are so damn good and if you go for dinner you have to try the chicken scallopini! I love this place."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant.  I had the chicken panini and my friend had a salad.  Wonderful.  We had the Coconut cake for dessert.  YUMMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Great service."}
{"text":"I love love this place. Everything about it is perfect. The food, the service, and the food...again!!! The veil and spinach ravioli was excellent as is the bruschetta"}
{"text":"Everyone knows Olive & Ivy has the best patio in the area! Even in the summer heat I like to sit out for the views and the people watching is excellent! I love their brunch menu for the eggs Benedict (I'm obsessed) and I've always heard that the smoked salmon bagel is great as well. Drinks are always good- I prefer their whiskey sour smash personally. They also have a decent wine list including some of my favorite budget Napa wines (Tangley Oaks Merlot for one example). The atmosphere is always trendy without being pretentious and it's a great date spot!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Some friends took us out to eat there & the food was amazing. Brandon & woman behind the bar did an amazing job & they took great care of us!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the GELATO!!!!!!!!  Market and swanky dining room.  Everything I ate was delicious and thoughtful.  My heirloom tomato salad was kind of funny, though.  There were multi colored hunks of tomato (which were superbly fresh and flavorful), chunks of avocado, big thick wedges of lettuce, and 2 bacon strips placed on top.  lol.  It was all amazingly fresh and tasty, but it was just funny.  It looked like they had forgotten to chop everything up and put it into a salad. I still loved it.  My friend's potatoe-y soup (cannot remember what it actually was) tasted flavorful and hearty.  All the bruschettas and breads with pesto were out of this world.  Great wines.  AND THEN.  $1.75 humongous cups of gelato.  With 3 flavors all tucked in there. And a shortbread cookie that made me weep tears of joy.  Seriously.  You can't even get the same amount of crappy froyo for $1.75.  Go eat the gelato.  Especially the PB&J flavor!!! AAAAHHH!!! SO TASTY!!!!"}
{"text":"People have been telling me about this place for a while and I should have listened earlier.   Food, service and ambience were all great. I made some substitutions to my meal and they nailed all of them.   I will be going back."}
{"text":"We ended up at Olive & Ivy as a 2nd - or 3rd choice due to our lateness in making a reservation for a party of 8 during the month of March.  We made the reservation about 9 days in advance.  We ended up with a primo indoor table on a Saturday night (a full house).  We were extremely pleased with the location, ambiance, service, wine list, and the food.  The dishes were spectacular.  I had the best sea scallops (with sweet polenta) that I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Great Salads and Bakery treats. Coffee is outstanding as well. Snack area items are a bit on the pricer side."}
{"text":"So the first time I visited Olive and Ivy was a few years back (probably a month after it first opened) I was not a fan at all. However, recently I had heard a few of my friends talking about how good this place was, so I figured it was probably just getting established when I visited before.   Last Saturday I decided to give it another go. And I am so glad I did! I am a fan of all fox restaurants - but this one might take the cake! The atmosphere and decor was perfect for a Saturday afternoon. They had the restaurant opened to the patio and the weather was absolutely gorgeous! Also they had a small band playing music, which was great!  The waitress was a little uneducated about the food and forgot to put in our order for flatbread, but she was nice - so I'll only take off one star. And the food - oh. my. god. The grilled chicken salad was the best I've had so far and the pasta was delicious!  I plan on returning soon. I think this might be a new favorite brunch/lunch spot."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best restaurant I've ever been to. Fabulous food, amazing service and great ambiance. I can't stop thinking about the hummus and bacon wrapped dates. I'm going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal at Olive & Ivy. We tried the sangria, which was good but not great. I'd definitely try something else if I went again but it was totally drinkable. Bacon wrapped dates were amazing...so good. The bread/pesto dip is as good as everyone else on Yelp says. I had the sea bass which was delish, and my husband's scallops were great too - his corn mixture under the scallops was the best part I think! To finish we had the ice cream bar dessert...how can you go wrong with caramel ice cream, marshmallow, peanut butter and magic shell topping??? So tasty. The atmosphere was great, very classy and hip but casual at the same time. Our server was great, fabulous sense of humor and made us feel very welcome there. Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Perfect atmosphere! There's nothing better than eating outside on a lovely evening on a beautiful patio with lights. Great food and good service. I wish I lived here year round so I could go back often, but alas, was only visiting."}
{"text":"It's one of the Fox restaurants on the waterfront in Scottsdale. It has a modern Mediterranean feel, with a great open kitchen. The patio is amazing, as you can see the river and the historic Scottsdale area. The waitress was very attentive yet not intrusive at all. Like all of the Fox restaurants, she was very well trained.  Their homemade bread with pesto is amazing. It's fresh and the pesto had excellent flavor.  We started with the mushroom bruschetta, served with garlic and cheese. Every element was done well, and it had the perfect amount of garlic.  The salmon entree was a great choice for lunch. It had a great crust, was done medium exactly as requested, and served with beets and fingerling potatoes."}
{"text":"Good food just like their Scottsdale location. It's quick-service - for lunch, they offered an assortment of paninis, pizza and salads. The line moved quickly (maybe too quickly, I forgot to order a drink and the girl behind the counter forgot to ask if I wanted one - nbd, I had water with me and was getting coffee before I flew out) and my panini came out to my table pretty fast as well. The roast beef panini was super filling and really good. Pizza also smelled and looked tempting. I also grabbed some snacks to go and everything was reasonably priced for the airport - the panini itself was under $10. If you need to plug in, there were power outlets at the bar that faces out into the airport.   Location - in terminal 4 really close to security checkpoint A, in the A1-A14 hall."}
{"text":"Strolling around and found this cute place. Started the afternoon with a friend and a nice glass of Chardonnay. Highly recommend the lamb meatballs and roasted Brussel sprout bruschetta. The service was friendly and fun."}
{"text":"We went for a drink and to relax before dinner.  We were made to feel welcome and were not rushed to have another drink or order more.  We were in their outdoor lounge area, on a perfect day.  It is nice to be able to sit, talk  and not be rushed.  The sangria is light and fresh, the vibe great.  We love this place."}
{"text":"Great brunch! We came here to recover and refuel after our hike up Camelback Mountain, selecting the restaurant on a combination of personal recommendations & Yelp reviews. The ambiance is great and has an expansive Mediterranean feel, yet at the same time our booth felt cozy. It also gave us a bit of a waterfront view (the patio, cooled by mist, would've been very tempting if not for my post-hike state).   Cinnamon is my mortal enemy but I really wanted to try their French toast anyhow. They happily accommodated my request for a non-cinnamon version and recommended I do the compote on the side too. Our server also recommended the homestyle cheddar biscuit, topped with sausage gravy. I am glad he did because it was amazing."}
{"text":"This place is still going strong after all these years.  The decor is beautiful and the bar area is a fun place to hang out.  This last visit I just had a cup of coffee and an  OK butter or olive oil cake for dessert."}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy is a must do for brunch or lunch in Scottsdale!  Fresh ingredients, attentive service, varied menu, awesome patio and gelato made on site! What more could a person ask for.   We had the hummus appetizer and it was amazing! Get the fresh veggies with it because they are, well, fresh!   I had the turkey grinder and she had the tuna salad sandwich. Both served on house made bread. Both very delicious!   They brought out a plate of fresh foccacia and house made pesto. It was superb!  She finished with snicker doodle gelato and I had chocolate/raspberry we weren't disappointed!"}
{"text":"We went with a rather large group around 5pm on a Wednesday night. It wasn't too busy at the bar so we were all able to gather around one side of the bar pretty comfortably. The bartenders are pretty inattentive to ordering a drink/food at the bar was difficult. They barely looked up to make eye contact with anyone! We tried their red sangria and funghi flatbread pizza which were both really yummy."}
{"text":"Came to Olive & Ivy on a Wednesday night and sat at the bar.  Ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio, a green salad, and the sea scallops.  The green salad was basic, but good with the perfect amount of dressing.  However, it took forever for me to get and wasn't able to get half way through it when the entree came out.  The sea scallop entree was not great, as the featured scallops were small and over-cooked.  They were served on a sweet corn polenta that was actually very good.  This was my one and only time here, but I expected much much better."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite restaurants during my visit to Arizona. Don't skip the mouthwatering lamb meatballs and bacon wrapped dates (loved the fresh bread and sauce with the meatballs).  For entrees we shared the sea bass and sweet potato cannelloni. Both were delicious but I preferred the cannelloni-- the pasta had both wonderful flavor and texture. We were stuffed but had to try the house made gelato and the peanut butter pudding. I loved the dark chocolate gelato and the coconut- the espresso was just ok and didn't have the best texture.  The peanut butter pudding was tasty but very rich and heavy.  Be sure to make a reservation as it can get quite crowded on weekends. We came a hoping to be seated a bit early and there was no space at the bar. Servers were quick and attentive. I was impressed by how quickly food came out even though it was so busy."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a fantastic meal! Our waitress was awesome (Nicole D). The food was perfectly prepared and delicious. The ambiance capped the experience.  We sat outside on a chilly evening. The heaters kept us warm. Great view and beautiful furnishings!  We will definitely be back... again and again!  The Bruschetta was amazing - You will come back just for this.  The steak and bacon wrapped tenderloins were also delectable!  Did I mention that we will come again?"}
{"text":"Amazing! This place easily became my favorite restaurant. Very enjoyable whether I'm there to get gelato after shopping, on a date night, or sitting on the patio for lunch. The food and the staff are amazing. I've brought about 4 people to this place, each of them loved it as well.  My last visit was the best. I was surprised to see they have a Dj on Friday nights. It was a nice touch to the atmosphere. My waitress was very knowledgeable and even split our entrees without us even asking for it. We ordered the scallops and lasagna! Both choices I recommend.   Very clean Great service Entertaining atmosphere AMAZING appetizers and entrees"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Small portions for the price, but high quality. The decor is amazing and loved being right by the canal! Great date spot."}
{"text":"It's a great venue -- and unlike many other places in downtown Scottsdale parking isn't too bad because the free underground parking is right next door. The atmosphere is very nice and the outside dining area is very romantic.  I had the scallops which were as good as I ever had. My partner had the salmon which was good but not enough to earn a 5 star.  Service was professional.   The coffee creme brulee was somewhat ordinary. It seemed to be from one of those mass production dessert places."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner there this evening. The chicken scollopine with  Spinach was fantastic.  Cheese cake Also excellent and view was delightful."}
{"text":"Always a reliable and delicious meal. I crave the Caesar salad and the lasagna bolognese. The sangria hits the spot too. Lovely ambience. Great place to bring visitor as the menu appeals to everyone."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this place but I had a lovely evening.  My boyfriend and I came here after dinner for some cocktails and we cozied right up to a fire pit on the patio.  I really thought the patio was charming and definitely not overcrowded.  The drinks were reasonably priced for Scottsdale in my opinion.  My main dislike of this place was the music.  Olive and ivy is a classy establishment and I would have liked the music to reflect that; instead we had club songs being spun by a DJ.  Call me crazy but I think a little Frank Sinatra would have been more appropriate and fitting.  Oh well."}
{"text":"I'm from Dallas Texas and was visiting Arizona for a quick vacation. We heard a lot about Scottsdale and we looked up places to eat, Olive & Ivy was one of the first things to pop up on yelp. The 2 stars I'm giving are only for the aesthetic of the place. The seating area outside on the patio is very appealing. We sat outside around a fire place and the patio was decorated with lights. Now let me get to the part that really made me disappointed. The food was terrible. First off the price is not cheap, so therefore if I'm paying for something expensive I expect it to be good. I came with 3 other people and only one thing out of all our orders was alright. We ordered the rib eye steak which is what they promote highly, we asked for it medium well. The steak was $45 and it comes with one side which is 2 small pieces of finger potatoes and that's all. The steak came out bleeding and pretty much Raw. It was very rare and red. Second the chicken in the Mediterranean salad was burned and tasteless. The waitress only appeared a few times. She did not ask for us how our food was at all, even after seeing that it was barley touched.  Only recommend coming here strictly for drinks and a cute place to sit with friends."}
{"text":"The food was simply delicious! We started with the homemade hummus. This was no ordinary hummus. It was filled with yummy veggies and goat cheese. We were then given the focaccia with a pesto spread. Very tasty, but the best was for last. The sweet potato cannelloni was one of the best dishes I have ever had. We also had the goat cheese and duck tortellini. This was very good as well. Great combination of flavors. The atmosphere was fun with open air seating."}
{"text":"Being delayed at the airport sucks... but with some decent dining options at PHX nowaday, it could be much, much worse!  I'm a fan of Olive & Ivy and the Marketplace in Old Town, and while the airport version isn't exactly the same, it's a big step up from what our airport used to offer!  Whether you're on a delay, in between flights, or running to catch a flight, this Olive & Ivy delivers.  Breakfast options include pastries, coffee, smoothies, eggs, oatmeal, and yogurt parfaits.  Lunch and dinner selections are salads, paninis and pizza.    The staff is friendly and almost all of the food is ready or will be ready for  you within minutes.  Thanks FRC for adding this and several other concepts to the airport!"}
{"text":"Time for an update only because I was invited to a dinner party last night at O&I that was absolutely perfect!  We sat in their beautiful private room, and it almost felt like we were at someone's house in their dining room.  Joel was our waiter and took fantastic care of our group.  As usual the food was delicious!  Last night I had the scallop entree (with bacon, salsify & yellow corn purée) and a side of spinach.  Jared had the salmon (with roasted beets, fingerling potatoes & horseradish vinaigrette).  We were pleased with both, as well as the bread and pesto, antipasti plate, and hummus starters.  I enjoyed a glass of Gewürztraminer while a variety of libations went down easy around the table as well including mojitos and beer.    After dinner, we moved the party outside and thankfully, the misters on the patio made this crazy AZ heat bearable!  The evening flew by (a reflection of the fine group of peeps I was with), and as midnight approached, I noticed the bar and most of the restaurant were empty... the DJ was packing up and our party moved on as well.  In usual Gabi manner, I headed home to get some beauty sleep.  Thanks again, O&I, for another wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"I was honestly blown away with the many flavors I experienced  here. First there was the freshly baked bread and pesto dipping sauce. By far the most flavorful pesto dipping sauce I've ever tasted. The bread melts in your mouth and the garlic pesto pairing is to die for. Then there was the spicy shrimp risotto and bone in ribeye that my wife and I shared. I'll start with the risotto. Flavor A+ however the consistency of the risotto was B-. It was a tad bit runny, but I still would highly recommend it as it was still a stellar dish. The ribeye, on the other hand, A++. I ordered it medium and it was cooked to perfection. Honestly I would recommend having the risotto as a side option. Lastly, the service was great and the drinks were great. Over all experience excellent."}
{"text":"I really love the original Olive and Ivy so I was excited to see a restaurant addition but this satellite location just disappoints. Stopped in for breakfast and they clearly have the most extensive breakfast menu off the restaurants in the A wing.   Ordered the Oatmeal (was missing the apples) which I said would be okay. But the oatmeal itself was way rich with the mousse and yet still very bland despite the fact that I added cinnamon and brown sugars. It's pretty much an overcooked sticky blob before the brown sugar. I could only eat about a third of it before I had to through it out.   Ordered and Ice Tea which and then had to order another because the Ice Tea Container was filled with coffee. Fortunately, I had time to get a new drink but in a airport restaurant most wouldn't. This place just isn't on their game.   My cinnamon roll was stale and tasted like it was 2 days old.   $12 and I left hungry. Meh."}
{"text":"Recommendation from an acquaintance.  Made OT dinner reservations.  We walked in from the Marketplace entrance that we were confused as to where the hostess was.  It turns out it was around the bar.  Both of the hostesses were friendly and one even complimented my dress.  We were quickly seated and was greeted by our happy server.  I started the night with a red sangria.  Pretty punchy, not super fruity which I liked.  For starters, we had the Manchego Bruschetta which came with chorizo and the Mediterranean Salad.  One bruschetta is a good bite for 2 people.  The Mediterranean salad was fresh and tasty.  The dressing was a little tangy that at one point, it went down the wrong pipe and I started coughing.  For dinner, I had the English Pea Tortellini which apparently is made in-house.  The sauce was delicious with bacon and mushrooms.  MMMMmmm, I still remember the taste of it.  My husband had the Natural Chicken with potato puree.  The chicken was juicy and although it was a simple dish, it was made well.  The portions for both were just right.  Not huge, but good individual portions.    I had a paper cut and needed a band-aid so I asked the server for one.  He went to go check and never came back so I figured he forgot, but then a lady came by and offered me different types of bandaid.  Perhaps she was the GM.  I picked the one with hearts.  That was nice of them.  They did not forget.  We asked more about the restaurant and the Fox Restaurant Concepts company and our server was knowledgeable and helpful in answering questions.  The server even brought out the list of all the other restaurants that are owned by FRC.  Overall, great food, friendly staff, tasty drinks, live DJ.  Great place to go with a group."}
{"text":"I went to Olive and Ivy 3 times while in Scottsdale over the past summer. It has an amazing atmosphere, cool vibes and great food! The drinks were always good, and the recommendations from the wait staff never disappointed.  They were also super helpful with my dairy restriction.  We were able to order the delicious bruschetta sampler and they made sure to keep all of the cheeses on the side for me.  I enjoyed every meal and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed myself when I dined at Olive and Ivy for the first time this past weekend.  The food was good as well as the service. They have many wines to choose from if that is your thing. My only compliant is that I was told on the phone that reservations were not needed so when I arrived there was only seating in the marketplace area of the restaurant.  I believe this took away from my entire experience.  Next time, I will be sure to make a reservation in order to secure better seating."}
{"text":"Great dinner here.  Nice view of waterfront, ask for a window seat.  Did not dine on patio as wind was whipping out there but those that did said the fire pits provided adequate warmth to do so. Food was delicious, tried the bruschetta appetizer and the combination of manchego, quince and spanish chorizo was unique and tasty.  Splitting each a beet and kale salad was a great way to taste two different salads, both excellent and not to be missed. Husband had the steak, bone-in rib-eye (huge portion - enough for lunch next day!) with potatoes and spinach done perfectly.  The sea bass was beautiful presentation and very good, but small serving size.  Server was professional and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Ambience was nice, not too loud so you couldn't have a conversation, service was friendly and attentive,  and while I only had a salad, it was delicious! Will definitely go back & try more things."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed in this place. It is right by the parking garage for the Fashion Square mall so parking is never an issue. They also do valet on certain nights I believe. The bacon-wrapped dates are so tasty and the pasta dish I had (can't remember the name) with the peas and bacon was seriously the best pasta I have ever eaten. My sister's finally told me to stop saying \"oh my god that is so good\" after hearing about it after every bite."}
{"text":"Ordered our food server got it wrong but offered us a free pastry to make up for it! Didn't matter everything was absolutely fantastic! Good Buisness!"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience for lunch here today.  Their sandwiches and flatbreads were amazing.  To be honest though, it was the amazing customer service that was provided that made the experience 5 star worthy.  My drink was never empty, and they were extremely acomodating.  I will be going back 100 more times because of how pleased I am."}
{"text":"First time trying Olive and Ivy last night for my birthday, recommendation from my sister. First of all, this restaurant is beautiful! I recommended sitting outside if it's not too cold. The ambiance is so nice!  We ordered a little bit of everything. 3 types of bruchetta, butter lettuce salad and the pesto flat bread, all to share. Everything was delicious! Fresh with good ingredients. Our server could not have been nicer. She made sure the meal was spaced out so we could have a nice relaxed evening. And the complimentary dessert at the end was extra special!   Great place. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Back again for a girls day lunch, again it was great.  We ordered bruschetta this time and a Charcuterie plate, also the artichoke hearts and dates.  Everything was great, the three bruschettas we has were amazing! The manchego and chorizo was my fav, but they were all great.  The artichokes were so yummy, they were garlicy and I loved it.  The charcuterie were so amazing, the prosciutto was out of this world."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now..once for my birthday years ago and once for brunch more recently. Here are my opinions:  - nice atmosphere...I especially enjoy the counter where you can order brunch items - interesting people-watching (can you say \"Scottsdale\"?) - decent food options, but nothing that really excites me - great service on both visits - comfortable patio with lots of lounging areas - cool location being close to Fashion Square and Old Town - nothing bad to say, but nothing outstanding either  Will I be back? Maybe, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while and came with a friend for dinner.  We spilt the trio of bruschetta's which probably paired with a salad could be a full meal.  I also had the veal ravioli and thought once the cheese melted it was a little on the salty side.  My favorite part of the meal was the chocolate molten cake with ice cream...chocolate lover heaven.  Nice ambiance along the canal..with lots of outdoor seating."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND   My girlfriend and business partner recommended we meet at Olive & Ivy for lunch and drinks for our meeting.  Olive & Ivy is a little hard to find at first, as it is tucked away in the Waterfront Camelback and Scottsdale restaurants in the back and looks like a tiny café from the street.  Once you finally find parking, (the best place is to use the parking garage across the street), find the restaurant.   The entrance is pretty unassuming, but it has a super chic and very impressive layout and vibe when you walk in.  There is a central bar with little couches around for a bit more causal seating, as well as a formal dining room.   There is also a cute central wine cellar in the front which makes a great selection for the wine menu.   The lighting is very modern and edgy.  We ordered the Mediterranean salad with shrimp as our add protein and hummus appetizer plate to share. The food was terrific.  I ordered the grapefruit mohito which was delicious.  The only complaint was that we weren't served water after asking for it over and over before we were able to get even got one glass. I kept asking for water refills, but never got more.   I did get all the refills on all of the expensive grapefruit mohitos though.  There are many different menus, including: Market Menu Brunch Menu Lunch Menu Dinner Menu Dessert Menu Happy Hour Menu  If you want to check out the food selection ahead of time, the best idea is to go to their website. Or, just be pleasantly surprised when you get there!  Hours: Brunch: Sat/Sun 10am - 3pm Lunch: Mon - Fri 11am - 3pm Happy Hour: Mon - Fri 3pm - 6pm Dinner: Sun - Thur 5pm - 10pm Fri/Sat 5pm - 11pm  Market Opens 7am Breakfast: 7am - 3pm  For more information: OliveandIvyRestaurant.com   I 4/5 highly recommend Olive & Ivy!"}
{"text":"Sam Fox hits the mark again! I had dinner with some friends and we were all impressed. Presentation was well executed and flavor was just as excellent. I had the Parmesan risotto as my entree. I liked the roasted cloves of garlic that gave bursts of flavor. The shrimp was cooked just right, not rubbery. Drinks were not watered down, and were very well priced for dining in and around Old Town and the Waterfront. The atmosphere/decor is spot on as well and the staff was very attentive. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"At Olive & Ivy, the quality of the food and atmosphere is not a question. The question is, \"Why isn't there more of this on my plate?\"  We had a group of 7 of us at a long table and our service was relatively swift. The place was relatively quiet, granted it was the middle of the week.   My qualms about portion size are with the flat breads and the veal ravioli dish. My brother in-law and I both finished the ravioli saying, \"OK, I wish there was more of this, I'm still starving\".  The server said that the portions were *big* and I felt that it was misleading. I should note that this entire family isn't full of extreme appetites either. The portions were just weren't entree sized in my opinion.  Would I come back here?  For appetizers and drinks, sure. But if I'm in the mood for dinner, I would order something else or go elsewhere to fill up."}
{"text":"Ok, the atmosphere here is great, noise is medium, but over all solid ... i has the salmon - cooked perfectly medium - great presentation- friendly authentic staff...  I'm a tough critic too... the calamari veggie app was $13.50 and small, only complaint. Besides that there is something for everyone ..."}
{"text":"Came in here tonight with my girlfriend and grandma are waiter Josh was extremely friendly and courteous specially he took the time with my elderly grandma which you don't see a lot anymore he also knew the menu like the back of his hand and pointed us in the direction of some extremely delicious dishes I will definitely be coming back to this place great atmosphere great food and great and great people thanks a lot Josh"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar for lunch. I'm vegan and have other special dietary restrictions. Sad to say that our server wasn't open to any suggestions for me. My husband had a cesar salad with salmon and it was \"just ok\".  The Pinot Grigio was the house choice and no other. The house choice was not good. I opted for water. I tried the sangria and that was tasty but served in a small glass with ice to the brim. We spent $60 just to leave and go eat lunch somewhere else.  Very disappointing lunch experience. Thankfully I was able to eat a delicious lunch elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great service and very interested in making sure customers are satisfied. Grilled Cheese Sandwich was fantastic but big enough for 2. A good stopping off place to grab a snack before your flight."}
{"text":"Marvelous, great ambiance, service and food selection. Our servers were top notch on the patio and in the restaurant. I felt the price was reasonable for a Scottsdale location.  If I were to return I'd probably just do appetizers and cocktails on the patio, it is really cool."}
{"text":"Good food, great service.  Went for lunch   Very interesting decor.  Hip Place to be.  However it was so loud in there we found ourselves practically yelling to be heard.   Not an intimate place for conversation."}
{"text":"Lovely upscale niche to lounge outside while enjoying a cocktail, desert and conversation. If you came solo, the community spaces are wonderful for meeting new people!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place!  My girlfriends planned a meetup there, and we were so  surprised.  The food was delicious and the service was very good.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went to olive and ivy to celebrate a friend's engagement. It was a bridesmaids brunch and we had to sit outdoors because the place was so busy. Although it was hot out, Josh P made our brunch absolutely incredible. I couldn't have asked for a more attentive server. He was very in tune with what each of us wanted, and he made the bride to be feel pampered. Josh truly went above and beyond to provide excellent service. If you go to olive and ivy, ask for Josh P if you want to best service in Phoenix!!!!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch and I LOVED it....  Super cool and nice place.  The service was absolutely freaking top notch.  Food was very good.    IVY SAUSAGE SANDWICH:  scrambled eggs, american cheese & housemade english muffin - Delicious  The breakfast potatoes were great.  CHOCOLATE CROISSANT:  Melted me... So flaky and great"}
{"text":"We really liked this place.  I had the shrimp risotto and the rest of my party ordered the margherita flat bread, lasagna and the bacon wrapped pork.  Everyone must've liked their dishes because we all finished our food; except for my husband who loaded up on the yummy bread and pesto dipping sauce beforehand.   My dish was perfectly cooked and the portion sizes are just right.  All around good food with great ambiance.  It's also a fun place to people watch!"}
{"text":"The food is very blah, small portions, over priced. the atmosphere is really nice to bad the $30,000.00 a year millionaire crowd likes to frequent the place as do the gold diggers. I say save your time and money and try someplace else unless of course this is the kind of place you are looking for."}
{"text":"Wow amazing food and service! We didn't even have a reservation and they got us in within 10 minutes.   After sitting, we received drinks promptly and ordered. Food came super quick. We ordered the kale salad with shrimp and the salmon plate. Also ordered an appetizer of bruschetta.   We will be back. Good service. Delicious healthy food. Couldn't ask for much more!!!"}
{"text":"Went for a B-Day dinner.... Good times, great food.  Even had a Moscow Mule (not even on the menu) at the bar.  Good times, but with all great times comes the part with the bill.  A bit pricey, but it was my B-Day and I had alligator arms.  Will be coming back, especially to have a loaf of bread with pesto....."}
{"text":"On a recent early morning flight out of Sky Harbor, I ate breakfast at Olive & Ivy and picked up a salad for my long flight. I was not impressed with the breakfast options, but the salad was great.   The bagel and cream cheese ($3) was not tasty and definitely not worth the price! I wish I had picked up a muffin instead because those looked freshly baked, whereas the bagel was not.   I was glad to have a fresh salad on my flight - much better than buying an expensive packaged meal from the airline! The Mediterranean Salad ($7) was made with spring mix, cherry tomatoes, diced cucumbers, Israeli couscous, toasted almonds, feta cheese and oregano dressing. The salad was hearty and the person behind the counter confirmed the salad had been freshly chopped and made that morning.   I'll return to Olive & Ivy at Sky Harbor next time I need lunch before my flight and save the breakfast and brunch dining for the original restaurant location  in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Guys? Do you want to impress your date with a fancy treat? This is IT!!  Nice place, nice atmosphere, kinda of romantic I should say too because of the lights, but definitely a good options for girls nights or even family dinner. You make it your own. I really like the food, but honestly here are my favorite: ready?? The Lasagna Bolognese with a Belvedere Blue Martini. Honestly this lasagna is so tiny/small that you will eat it in one or two bites (and so overpriced) but it is DELICIOSO!!! And the martini... well, it is Belvedere... you don't need more explanations, hello?? Haha. (please do not have more than 2, especially if it is your first date). Oh yeah, back to the subject. Last time I was there, we had a large group, 45 minute wait, but it was a Saturday night in Scottsdale, so nothing out of the normal... Oh, there is a DJ on Saturday nights, it is not obnoxious, so do not get intimidated if you do not like clubs, you can still hear what people say (well not at the bar) but the rest. If the weather is nice, I highly recommend to eat in the patio, all those lights make it so peaceful and romantic ... awwee... I need a boyfriend haha. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. The portions are a little small and the cocktails are not as great as they sound. A good place to pop in for a quick drink if you're out and about, but I don't think I'd have a full dinner here."}
{"text":"I just love this place. The vibe and food here is always just the right mix of excellence, deliciousness, and coolness.  If vibes can be bottled, capture the vibe here to enhance your own personality, home, or business.  Will sure to turn it into a winner!"}
{"text":"Looovvveee this place the view is amazing and the food is even better and the service! Wow! Best service out there! My sister brought me here for dinner a couple weeks ago and we loved it told our server it was our first time there & she told her manager and they gave us a free desert! We loved he environment so much that we decided to go back & we came back with our hubbys as a double date and again great time great service! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it evolves in simple elegant ways.  It's been a little more than a year since I've last been there.  I booked the reservation on line and was able to get a reservation 45 minutes earlier than quoted by phone.  On-line is where its at.  New addition since I've been there a cosmo dj spinning some old school tunes.  Love it, love it.  Took the parents, they are a little afraid of change but they give this a passing grade the last time we were here.  The sangria is very tasty and got two pitchers.  Order the lamb meatballs; pass on them, they need more flavor.  The stuffed dates are a sure hit though.  Entrees were pork tenderloin and chicken.  These were all perfect and flavorful.   Wait staff is perfect.  I finished off with the Hazelnut pudding.  The pudding was great, the pastry that was on the side, had mystery flavors that I would pass on.  I wish there was a location arond the Biltmore area.  Fox restaurants this place is a hit!"}
{"text":"One of my top choices for late night dinners, drinks and a good time with my friends. Service was excellent, the drinks were marvellous and them bruschettas were fantastic. Jeez, their margherite pizza was lit! That cheese, fresh basil and tomatoes on flat bread was probably the best I've ever tasted. I was filled up just on appetizers. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Terrible bar service. I love this place and brought my wedding party here in 2013. Came here Mar 13 2014, sat at the bar and got served drinks right away. Then the bartenders proceeded to ignore us for nearly 15 min despite us having food menus waiting to order dinner. The bar was 60% full so it wasn't super busy. Very unfortunate, and we had to ask the hostess for a manager. Manager came by and acknowledged the poor service, paid our tab, and we left. Disappointing and we will no longer promote this place, as there are plenty of great places to eat/drink in old town."}
{"text":"Great find in the Phoenix Sky Harbor airport. I had a few minutes to pick up lunch during a layover and my nose led me to Olive & Ivy (Terminal A across from A2). I got a sausage hash from the breakfast menu (ends at 11am IIRC) for $8.  While it was being prepared, one of the chefs told me that if I could finish the entire thing, it'd be on him, haha. It was enormous! Definitely no chance of finishing it. Tasty, though - LAX could definitely use a few restaurants like this for quick healthy bites en route to destinations."}
{"text":"This was such an amazing experience. The thought process if making the menu selections was beyond my expectations. I had the goat cheese and beet salad (half portion is perfect before dinner). Followed by Sweet Potato Cannelloni:roasted mushroom, toasted almond..oooomygoodness!! Delicious!!! Perfect portion and so delicious.  Probably going back before I head home!"}
{"text":"My friend was in town from Colrado and she wanted to do brunch somewhere. So I suggested Olive & Ivy.  The 1st thing I asked about(and the ENTIRE reason I suggested this place ) was the AMAZING Cherry Bread pudding dessert I had the first time I went. They don't have it anymore. I was so entirely distressed by that answer I wanted to walk out. But alas, we stayed. I rodered the sausage scramble with a side of toast and it had the perfect kick of spice. I also had the rasberry mojito and it aimed to please. My friend ordered the flatbread on my suggestion and it was also excellent. The food is great, above average, prices are well.. it's pricey but you'll defintiely have leftovers, portions are more than decent. So I can't say you don't get your money's worth However, if you're looking for \"dive\" prices for brunch..in a not so \"Scottsdale\" atmosphere...head to Giligins."}
{"text":"I came here last Saturday night with my family and I'm not sure what we were thinking but we didn't try to make a reservation until 2:00pm. That left us with 2 options- 5:15 and 9:15. Neither were appealing, but I really wanted to try this restaurant, so we went with the 5:15 sitting. It certainly felt strange eating that early, but I quickly got over that once I started to taste the food.  The first problem I had with this restaurant was that everything looked so good. My family and I must have spent a good 10 minutes optimizing our order. We coordinated a strategic attack on the menu making sure that we got to try at least one thing form every part of the menu.  We started with a Bruschetta and the Pesto Flatbread. The bruschetta was alright, a little small in terms of portions but our waiter did try to tell us. It was the Pesto Flatbread was what everyone at our table fought over. It was much larger than the bruschetta and had the creamiest, most delicious goat cheese on top.   We then had a mixture of salads and entrees. I wasn't feeling all that hungry (remember- it was 5:15) so I just got a simple green salad. Let me tell you for $5 that was a pretty reasonable sized salad and their simple vinaigrette was very flavorful.  My family members were all very happy with their dishes as well (sweet potato cannelloni, big eyed tuna, and the natural chicken), but the real winner of the evening was the Sangria.  We ordered a pitcher of Red Sangria (tempranillo, cassis, blackberry, raspberry, strawberry) to start with and even considered ordering more. It had a lovely sweetness to it that came from the fruits and it was very addicting. I will definitely be ordering that again.  I can definitely see myself coming here again and trying their other salads and their white sangria too."}
{"text":"beautiful outside patio on the waterfront with excellent food and service... the bacon wrapped dates, bruschetta and scallop entree were all delicious!  everyone from the host staff to wait staff to mgmt were all friendly and accomodating, will definitely return. the only (minor) issues we had were the iron patio chairs could use padding they were a bit cold and hard, and we thought it would've been easier if they had cut the bruschetta in half instead of thirds for our table of two...but other than those minor things def an A+ evening!"}
{"text":"Ordered the lamb gyro and red sangria.  The food was fresh and the drinks did not disappoint.  I sat at the bar where you can watch the chef in action.  Love the vibe and will have to make another trip out here!"}
{"text":"Everything we had here was great, from the service of the drinks to the food. Many things looked good and would love to return."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally tried O & I a couple of months ago and we enjoyed it so much that we returned last weekend and asked for the same server, who was excellent! The patio is gorgeous. Service impeccable. Food is great too. I really love their Focaccia Bread with Pesto that comes FREE when you get your drinks. Yum. We've tried a large sampling of their flatbreads, salads and appies and all were delish. My favorite was the bacon-wrapped dates and the butternut squash soup (I think it was a special). The server recommended a dessert on our first visit, which was exquisite, but I can't remember what it was...I just know we vowed to come back soon, which is always a good feeling when you leave a restaurant."}
{"text":"Really cool venue and my food is always delicious. Service can sometimes be an issue as this place is so large."}
{"text":"I took a client there hoping for a great meal and to conduct some business.  The hostess wanted to seat us next to a table that was about 8\" away.....I had to request a different table.   I don't want to hear their business nor do I want them to hear mine.   The next table offered sufficient privacy.    It took about 5 minutes before we were greated by a wait staff or even offered any water.  The music was that repetitive club type of annoying beat and rather loud, again, hard to conduct business, or really any conversation. The food was great....but I probably won't return with a client in the future.   It's about the whole experience."}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: Located along the \"Scottsdale waterfront\" (i.e. canal) this is among one of my favorites.  This is by far one of my favorite patio locations in Scottsdale. Whether you are there on business or pleasure, it's hard to go wrong with Olive & Ivy. The wait staff is very attentive and accommodating.    The menu at Olive and Ivy is simple and straightforward.  Their small bite offerings allow a solid taste of several different flavors.  Most of the dishes appear pleasant to both the eye and the palette.  Do yourself and your stomach a huge favor...  enjoy their weekend brunch sometime sooner than later.  Seasonal warning: when I was there last week, the noise on the patio was pretty bad.  I believe they are prepping along the waterfront for the NFL Super Bowl, at least according to the waiter.  Just outside of Olive and Ivy's patio was a very loud, BEEPING front-end loader making all kinds of noise.  We hardly noticed...  I SAID, WE HARDLY NOTICED :) Regardless, I'll still go back time and time again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this joint!  Great food, great service and a unique and fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Bad coffee. Never seen that kind is machine before but it's definitely not doing it for me. Dunno, I guess I'm not in this airport much, so who I am to say how this place is compared to the competition?  Still, the coffee was really, really bad. The $10 sandwiches looked good, but that's all I know about them. If I find myself in Phoenix airport again, who knows, maybe I'll be in the mood for a muffin and be in the same terminal. Maybe not.  Thanks for listening!"}
{"text":"Super trendy  Great vibe Good service Just overall awesome And great ice cream   Has a nice front patio over the creek And the staff is super awesome"}
{"text":"This restaurant was not a disappointment. We had an awesome waiter who was very attentive and the food we had was awesome! Make sure to start with the artichoke salad. Soooooo good!"}
{"text":"So this place is pretty fabulous!  I've been here on several occasions; for both lunch and dinner.  The food is remarkable and I want to decorate my home like this restaurant!  From the wall of wine bottles to the rustic atmosphere, this place has all the decor eye candy you could ask for.    Lunch time here is so nice, especially when they have the wall of windows opened towards the canal and the patio.  I ordered some bruschetta and the Margherita flatbread.  To start, we were brought some bread with house pesto.  I need to have this recipe, it was amazingly flavorful.  The service here is impeccable as well, our glasses were never emptied and there was always someone nearby that would check on us throughout.  The food I ordered was so tasty and you could tell they use fresh ingredients.  Will of course back for more!  Dinner time was to celebrate a birthday.  Our reservation was for 930pm.  Once we arrived we were promptly seated and brought out water.  Once the rest of our party arrived, we were immediately taken care of and ordered our food.  The restaurant at this point was pretty busy, but they had the windows open so the sound just flowed right out and made the already spacious space feel that much bigger.  I ordered the Potato Gnocchi Pomodoro.  Oh. my. goodness.  This was so crazy good.  I love gnocchi and could eat it all day, and this just hit the spot.  So perfectly seasoned and cooked, definitely comfort food in my book!  Everyone loved what they ordered and had no complaints.  Overall, this place is amazing and you can't go wrong going here for any occasion or time of day.  **Love it!**"}
{"text":"Visiting tourist.  The ambiance is really cute, service was a little bit slower but I think that's just common for Scottsdale. Good for large groups.   Highlight of my night was eating their house made pesto, I'm pretty sure I ate a jar's worth! LOL  Things I ate: Bread + pesto: 5 Lasagna: 3 Seabass: 4.5 Scallops: 3.5  Ambiance: 5 Service: 4 Food: 4 for Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Always great service with smile, and great food.  This is much better service than Fox's \"Training Restaurant\" called the Henry.  Very satisfied every time we dine here.  The Hostess, and front desk area people were so nice, and with smiles, smiles, and more smiles....the way i't supposed to be at Fox concept eateries.  We were very dissatisfied with the Henry, and will probably not go there again.  Olive and Ivy is a model of great service, and food."}
{"text":"I stopped in at Olive & Ivy for breakfast and decided on the oatmeal, which was served with warm apples and cinammon, and brown sugar.  It would've been really good had the oatmeal not been gooey, as if it'd been stirred too much before boiling.  Service was excellent.  Contemporary decor.  Price was high for oatmeal, but to be expected at an airport, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a sandwich during my layover. I ordered the roast beef hot with everything on it. I waited a good 15 minutes for my sandwich that was already made when I ordered it and just had to be put on the panini press. By the time it got to me it was already cold. Pretty disappointing. Especially since I paid $10 for just the sandwich and NOTHING else. No sides, no drink. Not sure what happened but I'm thinking they just forgot about it/me because I was sitting at a table with my number waiting patiently. There were maybe two additional customers in line at this time.    Other than that the place itself is cute and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Chocolate chip cookies are delicious. White chocolates and milk chocolates!! Yumm Yumm. Get the little ones served in the brown bag...they're much softer than the big ones.  Adorable little fast casual stop to get a quick salad or sandwich before heading on your way wherever that could be within terminal 4. Probably one of the healthier choices in the area.  Pricey $$$ but you're in an airport...what can you expect.   At least the food is good and won't make you sick, because nothing is worse than sitting on a flight with stomach problems."}
{"text":"Customer service was great!!!!!  Friendly staff (wish I caught our cashiers name to mention it), the food came out really really fast, and the guy that dropped it off was really helpful and nice too.  The bread and pesto is complimentary in the restaurant and $2 to add to a deli item in the \"market\" half of this place...get it...it's delicious!!!!   We enjoyed our Greek gyro lamb sandwich very much, and added a $2 side salad which was simple and delicious.  We should had gotten two salads.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Phoenix and this was the first place Danielle took me after getting off the plane!  What a great place!  Great wine room and the space was absolutely beautiful.  We took a seat at the large bar and started with a glass of tea, which was pretty good!  We ordered two flatbreads: the italian sausage and goat cheese and the mozzarella and basil.  Both came out rather quickly and both were pretty good!  Oh and one more thing. the fresh baked bread and pesto dip is worth the carbs and extra calories!  Service is very good and everyone was really friendly.  I'd definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"So I just got back to LA from Scottsdale, was there for a friends bachelor party. And me being me, IM HUNGRY. So I checked this place out from the yelp reviews and moved our squad there. And, MY GAWDDDDDDD IT WAS AMAZING.   This place was so freaking good we came for both brunch and dinner. The bomb!!!  Ok dinner I ordered the scallops and bruschetta. Excellent. Brunch I split with others and got the breakfast burrito, cinnamon roll latte and cinnamon roll french toast, shortrib flatbread. My lorddddd  Best way I can relate this to people is if you've ever had republique in La, this is scottsdales republique. Which basically is an amazing compliment. A MUST GO. TOP 20 restaurant of my life"}
{"text":"Pretty much every time I come here it's a wonderful, relaxing, and yummy experience! Very friendly customer service and they can accommodate specifics with no hassle. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"4 stars based on the sangria alone.  Order this motherfucker by the PITCHER, without apology.  If you can sit out on the patio, so much the better. if not, grab a comfortable booth near the bar."}
{"text":"I would like to start out by saying that I haven't eaten a full meal here...Only a croissant and iced latte.  The croissant was good!  The latte on the other hand was by far, the best I've ever had.  If you want a change from Starbucks, definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came to Scottsdale for April vacation/our \"babymoon\" and were given Olive and Ivy as a recommendation. It was all we wanted...Great food, great drinks and great staff. We came for lunch one afternoon and my wife decided it had to be our final dinner also. It was even better the second time around, made all the better by our server Jeremy. He was very attentive, gave great suggestions and was overall so pleasant we would come back here and ask to sit in his section. Definitely a must on a visit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Love this place! We went to Olive and Ivy for our anniversary. The waiter was very nice and pleasant! Food was delicious. After finishing our meals the waiter said since it's our anniversary desert is on the house. We got strawberry shortcake and it was absolutely delicious!! Had an awesome time!"}
{"text":"First things first, how cool is that FRC (Fox Restaurant Concepts) has opened up a few spots at the airport? AZ locals....you know what I'm talking about. I enjoy lunch at Olive and Ivy in Old Town, so this was a super pleasant surprise! I went with the ready to go items. The Mediterranean salad, a banana, a small bag of pirates booty an a shot of espresso all for $15.00! Now that's an airport deal if I've ever seen one! The salad wasn't as satisfying as I hoped, the portion size was great, just not as filling. Ingredients are fresh and it's an AZ establishment! Terminal 4 is the place to be."}
{"text":"It's been two years since my last visit and now I've finally had dinner here. The outdoor seating is lovely especially on a fall night. The.mm menu remind the same but I ventured to entrees instead of my usually Mediterranean salad. I ordered the salmon with fingerling potatoes and subbed it for cauliflower. The dish was a-ok. I was really hungry so I ate it all but found the cauliflower to we on the dry side and the sauce was quite sweet. Overall a satisfactory dish. Our server was 5-stars all the way. I wish I could remember his name but he was on top it- he'd make Sam Fox proud."}
{"text":"Great spot for groups, all of my experiences included slow service so be mentally prepared.   The bread with the pesto dip is worth the calories! Great selection of wine and \"good\" pasta for Arizona.   Typical fox restaurant."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for the first time. The food is good and the our server was nice."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Food good but nothing to brag about for sure. Quality, service, decor all trendy and awesome.  They had a cool outdoor space that looked great for private events."}
{"text":"This place has some truly unique flavors in their dishes. First of all, I don't think I've ever had pesto this good. I'm not usually a big bread eater at dinner, but it was hard not to have a whole loaf just to eat the pesto. I also got the prosciutto bruschetta with a drizzle of honey which was heavenly. My husband isn't the most eclectic of eaters and he was head over heals for it. The salmon entree was perfectly cooked, but I will say that some of the other entrees at the table were a little small. My suggestion to avoid leaving still hungry is to make sure that you get an appetizer or two first if you are getting any of the meat entrees. We all had gelato to finish, I chose the honey flavor. Even though I was stuffed by this point I was glad I made room because it was the perfect finish to dinner."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. The cute blonde cashier even got me limes from next door for my Modelo. Beer inside only. Chop salad was delicious and fresh 2 death even at 9pm on a Tuesday, in an airport. BEST AIRPORT SALAD EVER and I've had scores of airport salads."}
{"text":"Wow! One of the best meals we've had ever in our travels! Everyone in our group of 4 LOVED their meal.  We recommend bacon wrapped dates, the Tortellini, chicken scaloppine, bacon wrapped pork tenderloin and the butternut squash cannelloni.  All amazing flavor s and perfectly prepared. Table on patio overlooking waterfront with beautiful outdoor lighting. Impeccable service --- REALLY. Thank you Sarah for making or evening so special. Nice wine list by the glass."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best breakfast and brunch places in Arizona. Every time I come into town I have to go to Olive and Ivy as I used to live in old town and would go here on the regular. Now the items you have to order if you are a first timer or even a regular during brunch:  A pitcher of sangria (red is better than white but you can get them mixed). The sangria here is delicious and I have gone through pitchers of it here so be careful you will get a buzz without tasting the alcohol.  THE Breakfast Sandwich: I call it THE breakfast sandwich because it is THE BEST breakfast sandwich you can get in Arizona. It is on a crispy croissant and has avocado, mayo, bacon, and egg. I don't know how they do it but it is delicious no matter how many times I order it.  Appetizer: The trufulga flatbread. It's a flat bread with mushrooms and I believe truffles, and it is tasty, also their margarita flat bread is good too and even the sausage one is delicious.  Mediterranean Salad: This salad was also delicious, and although not as good as an original chop salad it is still delicious.  Also if you don't get bread REQUEST it before your meal arrives, their bread is fresh baked and comes with pesto and is delicious to just munch on just don't fill up. You can also ask for balsamic vinegar and oil as well but the pesto sauce is tastier to dip your bread in.  Again this is for brunch and honestly I have never had anything that was bad at this place.. EVER and I came here at least once a week for 5 years at one point."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great food.  This is a great place for everything. Date? Yes. Family dinner? Yes. Grab a bite with friends or a good drink? Yes.  All of their food is made fresh from scratch. Small menus are always a good sign.  You want top notch service- ask for Tommy. Pure professional."}
{"text":"Don't sit at the bar. This the second time I have sat at the bar and all the bartender wants to do flirt with the girls. I just want to order my dinner and I tip well. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place countless times and finally made the time to stop in! Came for happy hour on a Friday afternoon and sat by the bar. Inside is nicely decorated, they also have outdoor seating but a storm was coming in so we didn't sit out there. On a nice day, you would get a lovely view of the canal! It's right on the waterfront. Hubby and I got some drinks and apps. The happy hour menu is decent. The apps we got were the lamb meatballs and then their bruschetta. The on meatballs was just a tiny serving and then the bruschetta was pretty good, but honestly not the best I've had. Our server was nice, but that's about it. We had to find her or just stop another server every time we needed something. It was an okay experience, but not 5 stars. I might be back for the Sangria!"}
{"text":"We took some guests with us to have dinner on January 8 The service was excellent,ambiance very good and most importantly our food was very good The bone in ribeye was served on a bed of cream spinach,,,,excellent!!!! Will go back again"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for dinner on Friday night. The live dj creates a fun and inviting atmosphere. You have to start with an order of the mozzarella bruschetta. Phenomenal. A few of my other favorite dishes are the Mediterranean salad and the sweet potato cannelloni. Both of these are great vegetarian options and are signatures at Olive and Ivy. Oh, and cannot forget about the Ivy and Ginger drink. Just order it- you will not regret it."}
{"text":"I decided to visit Olive and Ivy this past weekend, when the weather was nice.  We decided to sit in the patio, which I do highly recommend if you want especially before it starts getting chilly.  The service was lacking.  However, the restaurant is so cute.  We decided to start off with the bruschetta - prosciutto & fig, funghi, and manchego.  My favorite was the funghi, but I love mushrooms.  If you are not a muschroom fan, then I recommend the manchego.  That was good.  There wasn't alot of bruschetta - I think it was 3 slices each. I then ordered the goat cheese tortelli.  One Word - \"YUMMMMMM!\" It was so good.  I love goat cheese. - the goat cheese, sauce, and duck was a great combination.  I practically ate my whole meal.  If licking your bowl wasn't inappropriate, I definitely would of done it.   We finished with gelato at the gelato bar.  Pretty good too.    ."}
{"text":"Recently had lunch with friends here and ordered a Margherita Flatbread, $12.  The flatbread is really a Pizza....I don't know why restaurants name Pizza different things, just call it what it is!  Anyway, the Pizza was very good.  It had a nice Garlicky kick to it and the Sauce was very light.....delish!  I had an Iced Tea to wash it down and it was very refreshing....I must have drank 5 or 6 glasses.  The service was great too, nice place to grab some lunch.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"This is a very nice looking restaurant...but it is in Scottsdale so I expect nothing less in term of appearance and decor.  My friends and I dine outside on a nice day in May so we could still tolerate the weather despite flies hovering over our table because we had the smoked salmon and halibut.    I heard about Olive & Ivy so so I was expecting superb dishes but it could be what we ordered because it certainly did not meet my expectations.    Smoked Salmon flatbread- I highly reccommend the flatbreads because it is delicious!  You know what else is delicious? Their homemade bread with pesto dip!!!!   I can eat this ALL DAY!   Marinated Hanger Certified Angus Beef Steak- it was ok, nothing really special about this dish.  Alaskan Halibut - this dish did not stand out at all. Cavatelli Pasta- this was a disappointment, I ask the waiter for suggestion and this was what he suggested.  Maybe i'm not a Cavatelli fan, but it was like eating dough with minimal spiced ground pork.   Go ahead and try- see if you agree with me?   So go for the atmosphere, drinks, and bread! :)  I highly reccommend that!    If you dine outside- you can see a little canal running through- so it is river side like dining.  Boojie ;)"}
{"text":"Malibu Rum Barbie has to alternate this place with the Sangria Slut. Somehow, she found out the White Sangria comes in a Tang-rimmed glass and that floozy loves to lick anything.   But again, I digress people. I have frequented O&I nearly three dozen times in the past couple years. Always enjoy myself as I usually go with a group of friends ready to drink.   Appetizers are delish. Hummus. Yummus. Flatbreads are tasty and you can still get the Pesto off menu. Just ask. They'll do it. Brunch is Fab!!! Unfortunately, my wallet takes a hit here. Their prices are a bit high but I'm sure it's the Waterfront rents that make them do it."}
{"text":"Visiting Arizona. A friend took us here for dinner. Ambiance very modern romantic, nice outdoor patio. Waiter was very friendly. I ordered the fig and ginger mule and wild mushroom pappardelle with added shrimp. Both of which were delicious! 9/10. Highly recommend, and I wish they had more locations outside Arizona!!!"}
{"text":"Cool place but awful service, for me at least. I was there with my wife yesterday for our anniversary. We had an awesome table on the patio but our server (John) was sooo slow and disinterested it was insane. He walked by our table 5-6 times to go over chat with his two friends at a table next to us but he kept ignoring us. It took him almost 30 minuets just to bring me a soda...honestly he was kinda creepy too.  I typically don't like writing bad reviews but man this guy has no business of being a server at all.  The restaurant is cool and the food is pretty solid too. Reasonably priced too. But crappy service will turn me to go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Happy hour!! $3 bruschetta!! Delish~    Wasn't very busy for happy hour on Wednesday. This was my first time here. Love the decor and the bathroom is just medieval. Friendly staff and delicious food. Their bruschetta is awesome. Lots of variety to choose from.   Also got some gelato. So many yummy flavors and they didn't mind us sampling each and everyone of them. I ended up getting the white chocolate mint. OMG the mint punches you in the face, it's so good.  Would've love to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Have to eat, right?  Lay over in Phoenix in terminal A, great breakfast sandwiches.  We shared a breakfast club and the breakfast sandwich- both were great but I think the breakfast sandwich ruled the day"}
{"text":"5 stars for extremely passionate service and Chad.  We ordered takeout dinner for a family reunion of 12 on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving (we're not from the area).  We ordered a TON of dishes, mostly salads, appetizers and flatbreads for sharing.  One in our party has an allergy to garlic, so we requested that garlic dishes be flagged.     When we arrived, the kitchen was finishing up our order with  \"Garlic\" written on all applicable boxes.  In fact, just about every box.  Chad, who was running the kitchen, pointed this out and then suggested a risotto specialty that was garlic free.  While his staff whipped it up immediately (the restaurant was medium busy at the time), Chad went about retrieving breads and sauces to make our meal even more enjoyable, more stuff than we deserved.  He stayed with us until everything was complete and triple-checked.    The food was very good, though judging takeout -- without proper heat and presentation -- is hard.  But we will be back when we are in Scottsdale because Chad and the rest of his staff are true hosts and restauranteurs."}
{"text":"Walking into Olive & Ivy, I knew I was going to love it. The ambiance is trendy with high ceilings, unique fixturing, and a large patio.   The menu is gluten free friendly, with notations on the primary menu. To start we got the hummus with veggies. The hummus was not too creamy and not too oily. It came with cucumbers, tomatoes, and onions on top. We really enjoyed it.   For my dinner, I got the sea scallops with sweet polenta and Brussel sprouts. The scallops were perfectly cooked and the polenta was a sweet and flavorful addition. It was a pretty light and flavorful dish.   I would definitely come back if I'm in the area. The menu has many healthy options to try!"}
{"text":"For some reason this place is my all time favorite restaurant right now. I go here for lunch every time i visit my sister in Scottsdale.  It is adorable inside and I love the little market so you can get the HUMMUS TO GO! I am obsessed with the hummus. It has tomatoes onians and feta on top, YUM! I also like the grilled artichokes, which are not what you'd expect, its more like a salad, but a delicious one at that. The drinks are always good and the service is always friendly and attentive. I also save room and stop in the market to get some yummy gelato afterwards, perfection i must say."}
{"text":"Quality, if overpriced food.  Nice decor.  Good service."}
{"text":"Really delicious dinner spot.  Trendy, so wear your outfit to be seen in Only one complaint, it was very loud!   RESERVATIONS: They do take them on Open Table. It's gets busy so make a reservation. We didn't have a reservation however they do have some lounge seating so we were able to sit there with full menu   OUTDOOR SEATING AND BAR: They have a nice large patio with misters There are some stools around around the bar. I couldn't tell if people were just drinking there or also eating   SERVICE:  Excellent service, food was timed perfectly and they even split the dishes on separate plates (a friend and I shared a salad and entree) without us having to ask   FOOD:  The portions were quite large, even the small plates section.  The trio of bruschetta is a great way to start the meal. The Mozzarella was a favorite of the group  The BEST part of the meal was the Sweet Potato Cannelloni. Very flavorful and well seasoned.   PARKING: There are spaces in the area and a parking garage"}
{"text":"Excellent Service!  This is one of my go to places to meet friends for happy hour.  I have to say they did not disappoint when I took my cousin for her birthday.  The bartender was great.  She made sure we knew there was less than 30 left for happy hour, then again 5 mins prior, she made sure we had our drinks and food order by 6pm.  Great Atmosphere and great service.  We really appreciate the extra attention."}
{"text":"Even tho this is a fairly large restaurant - I would recommend making reservations. Also, if you want to sit on the patio you need to tell them when you make your reservations. We didn't know that, but wish we had known because the patio was so charming & delightful. The inside was quite noisy, but we did enjoy watching the chefs at work in the open kitchen. But it was our server that made our whole experience at the restaurant a wonderful evening. Nikki was the kind of person that is full of personality, wit and charm - someone you would love to have sit down and join you for dinner!! Efficient, knew the menu backwards & forwards and we loved all of her suggestions. The Chefs are amazing! Watching them work in the open kitchen was both fascinating and inspiring - and the food was fabulous! Everything is made in house and was delicious. There were several different kinds of Bruschetta and we enjoyed each of the three that we ordered. The beet salad was wonderful as was the Mediterranean salad. The flavors in the sweet potato cannelloni were both unique and wonderfully seasoned & delicious. The mushroom pasta was equally as good, and my husband throughly enjoyed his natural chicken & mashed potatoes. At the suggestion of our server we ordered the lemon pudding cake for dessert ......yes.... it was wonderful. We definitely will come back on our next trip!"}
{"text":"Went today for our office holiday party.   Everyone was very happy with both the service and the food. Our server Alfred was very attentive and incredibly knowledgable about the menu, both food and cocktails.   We started with the bread and pesto, which is complementary and also ordered the hummus, charcuterie plate, and bacon wrapped dates.  Hummus was flavorful with garlic and lemon and diced cucumber on top.  Dates were wonderfully sweet and soft and wrapped in thick salty bacon with a red pepper remoulade. The chef's charcuterie plate had nice thick bread, goat cheese spread, several different meats and olives.  The pesto was alright, not as much flavor as I usually expect,  but fresh and bright.  Entrees were the lasagna with bolognase, chicken panini,  sweet potato canneloni and veal and spinach raviloi.  The pasta is made in house.   I didn't try everything,  but all our party was happy.   I can say the veal and spinach raviolI was amazing!   Fresh pasta, tiny chunks of tender veal and fresh spinach in a butter sauce and pesto oil to finish.   It was amazingly rich and delicious. Dessert was lemon pudding with salted butter gelato and a spongy chocolate cake with chocolate ganache \"kisses\" piped on the plate and a ginger gelato.  They make 20 flavors of gelato in house.   I usually dislike gelato because it has a lower butterfat content than ice cream,  but theirs was creamy, smooth and delicious. Overall,   our experience was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Love this place, one of my favorites but I have noticed it isn't always consistent with the excellent taste.  over all the atmosphere is top notch!! sit on the patio if you can! great service always! recommend making reservations :)"}
{"text":"Terminal 4 of the airport. Popular bit quick. Order and go and wait for the food to be brought to you. Only been here twice but had a great experience both times. Yummy vittles for my tummy -if you have time, check them out!"}
{"text":"Went here thanks to the gift cards I got for xmas because costco was selling Fox Restaurants gift card packages.  I have been to one other Fox restaurant, the arrogant butcher and it was yummy.  Olive and Ivy was really great, the service was awesome and I honestly believe the food was the best I have ever had.  The bacon wrapped dates were so rich with flavor it defies description.  My shrimp risotto was awesome.  The 3 types of bruschetta we had were all great.  2 other people in my party had 2 of the different pastas and they were both amazing.    The signature cocktail I had was great although $12 is steep.  I would eat here every day if I could afford it.  It came out to about $45 per person with food and drinks and it was worth it."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were walking around Fashion Square and we decided to have dinner at Olive and Ivy. We were told there was about a 45 minute wait so we had a seat on the patio. After at least 45 minutes of waiting (and watching several patrons put their names on the list after us and get seated well before us) I went in and asked about how much longer until we could be seated, and was told about 15 minutes. 20 minutes later we were finally seated. I mean it was busy, but not that busy so needless to say we were a little frustrated. Now, all of that being said, dinner was amazing. I had the sea bass and my girlfriend had the ahi tuna. We thought both were outstanding. The service (once we got in) was great and our food came surprisingly quickly. I highly recommend this place, but you should definitely make a reservation."}
{"text":"Tiffany, our server, was FANTASTIC! She was very helpful in deciding what to order. She was so cheerful and positive. Her attitude and knowledge really made our experience just that much better. I love Olive & Ivy!!"}
{"text":"Visited from Canada a few years ago, and still haven't found a restaurant I enjoy more than here. Superb food and ambience. Will be back sometime in the future."}
{"text":"I don't live in this area, but my brother and his girlfriend do. My parents had visited and they all came here for dinner. Ever since they raved highly of this place and made it a must try when we came to visit.  We called the day before to reserve a table. When we arrived we were immediately sat at our all ready table. Our server was nice throughout the dinner. We started with a mozzarella appetizer and the bacon wrapped dates. Both were so satisfying. We loved the bacon wrapped dates so much we ordered a second plate of them. We ordered a bottle of the Riesling Champagne which was very smooth. Easy to sip and offered so many taste elements.   I ordered the chicken scallopini. It was lightly breaded and cooked perfectly. The chicken laid on top of a bed of flavored spinach which complimented the chicken nicely. My girls both got the mac n cheese which was very cheesy and perfect for both my girls. My hubby ordered the sea scallops which is definitely out of his normal ordering. My dad raved about it so he got it and said it was the best scallops he has ever had. They were really good! They knew how to perfectly season and cook them.  Their complimentary bread was a hit as well!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for Happy Hour!  The Manchego was a fun starter for me!  It was bread topped with fresh ingredients and a little on the sweet side.  The best thing here to me are their flat breads.  I've had the Prosciutto Crudo (potatoes), Margherita, and the Piccante (sausage and salami).  If I had to pick a favorite, I would go with the piccante as the best only since it had a lot of kick to it, and I don't want to go with the boring route.  The service is good and the view of the water is nice.  This place has a nice vibe and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Be prepared for a low key but high level feast."}
{"text":"From making the reservation to our server and our wonderful food and beautiful patio. Everything was perfect will be back."}
{"text":"I love their outside seating! plenty of shady areas. I love the hummus! great vibe, perfect for date night. and unlike other places nearby, not overly expensive."}
{"text":"Business lunch early December 2016.  Very good.  Table was a little cramped for our group of 8 but we managed just fine.  Recommend."}
{"text":"A great meal of sea scallops and wine. The service was even better.  A table of 4 enjoyed the venue and food.    Desert was along good, mine some gelato, others trees leches..."}
{"text":"\"Old World meets new at Olive & Ivy Restaurant & Marketplace, which blends the flavors and timeless elegance of the Mediterranean with contemporary California chic. Olive & Ivy brings a slice of a bustling Mediterranean neighborhood market to the Scottsdale Waterfront.\" - Fox Restaurant Concepts.  A great location for a romantic dinner, swilling late night with your friends, or stopping in for some gelatto.  What makes this restaurant unique is the marketplace where one can order fresh baked breads, purchase wine, or delight in their gelatto.  In the dining room await an array of contemporary mediterranean dishes.  I will come here again and again for three things: the Parmesan truffle fries ($5) the red sangria ($7 for a nearly orgasmic bevy of tempranillo, cassis, blackberry, raspberry, and strawberry) and patio seating.  As with virtually 90% of Scottsdale establishments, there is ambiance, beautiful people, groovy downtempo beats, and a great view of the canal  (lol) on the outside patio.  The rack of lamb with beech mushrooms, fava beans, and piquillo pepper marmelade is one of my favorite dishes here.   It is quite succulent, and has a wonderful smoky grilled taste.  The free range chicken with wild mushrooms, English peas, and citrus jus is also another delectable dish. Though these ingredients are so simple, I smiled inwardly as suddenly I was transported back to my grandmothers kitchen. Ahhh! Food nostalgia, it's why I eat.  Cons: No happy hour  Prices are the usual for a moderate upscale restaurant in Scottsdale.   Appetizers: $6-$12 Entrees: $17-36 Salads: $8-$10"}
{"text":"The ambiance is great!  They have a lovely patio with a bit of a retro feel.  Their happy hour menu is plentiful so keep the food and drinks coming!  If you like brussel sprouts, you can't go wrong with the brussel bruschetta."}

The server explained that everything is made in house .I was with my wife and 27 yr. old son .My wife had salmon cooked exactly how she wanted it , both my son and I had a pasta dish and a appy . The deserts were all $5 and I had Neapolitan ice cream cake which was one of my favourite desert I have ever had . . All in all an eatery you should definitely pencil in on your next trip to the Valley of the sun"}

{"text":"It was my first time visiting Scottsdale area. I was very excited to find Olive & Ivy for Sunday Brunch. I saw excellent reviews and beautiful photos on Yelp and decided to check it out. This place is huge!!! It has multiple sections, outdoor shaded patio, full bar with TVs, event rooms, dinning area, and open kitchen. It's modernly designed and decorated. Initially I was worried about not having the reservation and might have to wait for a seat. Nope! We were able to be seated right the way. Their brunch menu is pretty simple. Few items on traditional breakfast and few items for sandwiches and flatbread. They also have a desert and coffee section so they offer full espresso bar items. I decided to go with plain orange juice for a hot day and my friend had latte. Excellent start for our brunch. They served complimentary bread, which was okay. I had their LAMB GYRO, which is a wrapped in a large pita bread with tomatoes, lettuce. It was wonderful!! It looks plain at the first sight but don't let it fool you. The flavors are excellent! The lamb gyro was well reasoned, juice, just perfect for the wrap. I had a side salad to balance the dish. It was really good. I loved the vibe of this restaurant. It's beautiful, it's casual, it's serving good food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Scottsdale whenever I go to Fashion Square. I think it is way better than eating in the food court inside the mall. It's a fun and great atmosphere to have lunch or even dinner and to go for drinks.  I really enjoy the Fox restaurants."}
{"text":"I got the turkey bacon and avocado sandwich. It was good not great. Great to eat because your at the airport. They have a television and a nice  area to sit while you charge your electronic devices. Prices are OK its basically salads sandwiches pizza. They also have some alcohol selections."}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy has a beautiful location in downtown Scottsdale right on the waterfront. The salad I had there was nothing special, but it was good, and the fun atmosphere made it worth it. If you're looking for a place near old town Scottsdale that's not too busy, I would say this is a safe bet."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!!!  Every time I go to Scottsdale I have to go to this place, I'm obsessed. I with they had a location in San Diego where I live.  To start, the location itself is beautiful, upscale, and very cool. I enjoy people watching here too. They have a gorgeous outdoor area to eat as well. The service is always wonderful, attentive, and explain the dishes very well.   The food. They start you off with Pesto and bread. Probably the best pesto I have had in my life, including my time in Italy. I secretly go here the pesto alone. This past visit, I tried the salmon caesar salad which was delicious. The salmon was cooked medium and was very tender and light. The salad itself was quite good as well. My friend ordered the burger which looked heavenly.  Looking forward to my next visit here!!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Great service. Very nice staff. Food was great. Highly recommend the filet and also the lamb meatballs as well.  Only thing is considering this place has a whole room just for wine the fact that they don't carry a single moscato was disappointing."}
{"text":"Traveling through PHX is always a terrible experience, as you have to hoof it the 3 miles from one terminal to the other, but at least the food is good, right? Not so much.  The \"traditional breakfast\" at Olive & Ivy was one of the worst breakfasts I've ever had, airport or otherwise. The bacon was so greasy that it was literally coated in a thick layer of slime. The eggs were even greasy! Seriously, how do you manage to make scrambled eggs oily & gross? The potatoes were cooked to the point of being on the verge of burnt.  The one saving grace was an English muffin, which was warmed, though not toasted. It's not like they can take credit for \"making\" that, though...  The extra star is for the employees, who were nice.  I wouldn't recommend this place for breakfast to anyone..."}
{"text":"I was immediately impressed with how stylish Olive and Ivy was, and then shortly thereafter completely let down by the food.   I was in a large group that had convened for lunch there, and the consensus was a resounding \"Bleh.\" I ordered some raviolis that weren't bad to the taste, but three or four average sized raviolis aren't gonna do much for a brother who wants to leave somewhere not hungry anymore.   As soon as we left I was already looking for a second lunch spot. I have a big appetite, in fairness, but if you're paying eight or nine or ten bucks for a plate, it shouldn't feel like \"pre-eating.\""}
{"text":"Delicious!!! This place had excellent customer service with every employee we walked by either smiling or saying hello, a great ambience & terrific food. I had the lamb gyro and my husband had the chicken panini, both were tasty. The pesto was to die for!!! Very affordable, we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and ambiance in Downtown Scottsdale!  This restaurant is a little oasis where you can enjoy the outdoors without feeling like the heat is draining the life from you (I'm not local to this place If you can't tell).  Being from Denver where we've admittedly become spoiled with a great restaurant scene, I found this place to meet and exceed my high expectations.  The bruschetta are all amazing (def try the prosciutto) and the drinks were spot-in with generous pours and unique options.  Bacon wrapped dates are not to be missed as a starter as well.  Go ahead, sit on the patio and enjoy the umbrella of shade provided by the trees while listening to the fountains.  It's like free therapy while you eat good food!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food was tasty. Not amazing but was a good dinner. Didn't like their Merlot or Cabernet selection for the glass but I enjoyed the dinner."}
{"text":"Sugar rush!  Went back for the breakfast items (pastries to be specific).  I ordered two cinnamon roll \"centers.\"  I'm not sure why they call the rolls centers, but I do know that they are really big and really good and really gooey.  If you want your morning sugar rush, get one...or two.  I also got a raisin croissant.  It's called something fancier, but I have no idea what.  It is $3, but the thing is the size of two regular croissants.  It didn't have quite as much raisins as I would have liked, but it was flaky, buttery, and had a nice sugary glaze on top.    FRC, you all need to open a joint or two in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I had the most delicious turkey panini with avocado! They use quality ingredients and their food tastes so fresh! I so got their fresh baked cookies that only have like 5 ingredients!!! I love wholesome unrefined foods and this restaurant is a great place for real food! I hope to see one around where I love soon!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a nice lunch after viewing the art installation along the canal.  They are a larger place catering to an affluent crowd and serve what they described as California Mediterranean cuisine.  The lunch menu featured sandwiches, flat breads, salads and bruschettas and almost every table seemed to be enjoying a glass of wine with lunch.  The dress code seemed a bit fancy and I did feel a bit under dressed in my jeans but it didn't seem to affect our service.  We opted for the chicken chopped salad and got the half size at the recommendation of our fine server, which was still plenty big for lunch.  We also shared a cup (really a small bowl) of the daily soup special, beer cheese-thin but good.  Fresh focaccia and pesto also come with your meal and, we decided to join the crowd and have some wine too.  Service was attentive with water glasses kept full and the salads arrived without delay.  This place seems well run.  Hopefully on a future visit it would be warm enough to sit outside on their large shady patio.  Recommended"}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy has quickly become one of my favorites! The patio is gorgeous and has a beautiful garden patio feel. The servers are friendly and attentive. The food, drinks and desserts are on point. The Chopped Chicken salad is my favorite if you enjoy salad and the  Prosciutto Mascarpone Tortelli is to die. The Lemon Tres Leches Cake is perfection and the Tangerine  Cheesecake is a real treat! Make sure to try the Red Sangria, it's perfect on any day."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch, we made a reservation for noon and got seated right away! Definitely make a reservation, there weren't any seats left on the patio and the inside was starting to fill up. Love the ambiance, it is so open and the patio garden look fantastic! The sangria is super refreshing and tastes amazing, I tried the red one yummy! They make all their bread in house so it's always fresh, you get a complimentary plate of bread with their signature pesto sauce and we scraped that thing dry. I love pesto though :) I ordered the mediterranean salad and added chicken ($14.50) it was very fresh and they put in just the right amount of dressing. Now for the not so good plate.... the Ivy Sausage Sandwich ($11) It looked and tasted like McDonalds sausage sandwich, super oily but what do you expect when it's sausage. I was expecting something a little more tasteful and classy for the price of the sandwich. Even the eggs looked like McD's eggs and it was under flavored, very disappointed with that dish. But overall, it was still a great experience, our server was knowledgeable and really nice."}
{"text":"I've gone to Olive & Ivy a couple of times and I love everything about it. The atmosphere, the friendliness of the waiters, and the food make the entire restaurant wonderful. It's not the best food I've ever had, but it is good and everything else combined just really make me like this restaurant.   The lamb gyro is really good for lunch. It was not too heavy and the lamb flavor wasn't too overpowering. Their flatbreads are also really good, I think we got the Mediterranean one and, honestly, anything with olives automatically boosts my liking for the dish.  It's a great place to just sit and talk and have a glass of wine with your food. Whether you sit inside or outside, it's beautiful.  Also, don't miss out on the gelato! I get it every time. I am completely addicted, but I also have a huge sweet tooth. Every flavor is delicious and they are really nice even when I ask for a ton of samples because I can't make up my mind. :)"}
{"text":"Great patio, cool decor but for a Fox concept I was disappointed in the service.  I have been to almost all the other concepts Fox owns and brag to my Chicago friends how great they are but we didn't make it past drinks and went for dinner at another place.  The service was just bad. It was not just our server (so it wasn't like 1 person was having a bad day) we had 3 people that were boarding rude to us in a half an hour on a Monday at 5:30p when they were not busy. I'd go back for the $5 wine at happy hour but not waisting my money on dinner."}
{"text":"Their bruschetta is to die for and I had this Italian dish that had cheese and sweet potatoe inside that I can't remember the name of but it was seriously so good!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? Our waiter's name was Timothy. Had to of been one of the best, most professional waiters I have ever seen. Great guy, very knowledgable and helps you chose, without any negative opinion. I highly recommend when you go here, you specifically ask to have this guy wait on you. Next, the atmosphere. What a great place! Very romantic. As my wife(laura) stated below, we fell back in love and just focused on ourselves and not anything else around us. Glad I made reservations, because it seemed dead when we first got there (6pm) and filled up shortly after we sat down. The wife and I both commented on how cool the bathrooms were. You don't see that every day,lol. Every time we left our table, any worker walking by, would re-fold our napkin. That was really nice, and we loved it. Onto the food. We ordered the Bruschetta Trio as the appetizer. WOW, what a great start out. Very good. We really got full off this so we ordered a salad and Chicken Scallopini. They split both for us, which was very nice of them. Salad was very fresh and good. I highly recommend the chicken meal we had. Very very good and seats well with your stomach and a glass of wine. We ordered a bottle of Ramon_B wich was $40. It was a limited bottle, but worth every penny for the meal and atmosphere. Then we ordered the peanut butter Ice-cream bar for dessert. The marshmellow did not taste good. Seemed still frozen, but was still too much and just didn't go with the whole dessert. We told Tim about it and he said he would pass it on. The best bonus of this was when we came in, we told Tim we were Yelpers and were looking up what to get. Tim remembered this, told the manager, and gave us our Dessert for FREE, without even mentioning it to us. Guys, if you want to wooo your wife, and have one of the best romantic nights, even for just visiting one night, this is the place!! Great job Tim and Olive & Ivy!!"}
{"text":"Holy smokes is that free focaccia bread delicious. Great food, great location, great space. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and it's always on point. The wife had the pork tenderloin, I had the tuna. Both were fantastic."}
{"text":"Had a bigger breakfast and not just a sandwich after the redetermination back from Hawaii.  Great replenishing spot in the airport."}
{"text":"Very gorgeous restaurant with amazing atmosphere--it's really large and yet not too noisy when its full of people. Really nice surrounding area filled with restaurants. The cafe section of the restaurant opens earlier and yet I cannot find the exact time online.   The brunch menu was a little uninspiring and pretty limited compared to their regular menu? Pretty regular items, and from the photos on Yelp, sadly they don't match the beautiful decor either :( Despite of this, the food was fine. The potatoes that came with scrambles were the best! I also love the complimentary bread, which went really well with the pesto!  Otherwise, I would come at a non-brunch time, or just ordered from the cafe with pastries..."}
{"text":"this is the place to go! the inside of this place, the outside, the bathrooms, just amazing. this is where you go on a first date (which was happening next to us btw), this is the place to wowster someone! my husband didn't need to wow me and I picked this place but whatever lol.   the bread served here with that pesto stuff is just omg. I'd have to say it was my favorite thing we ate on the whole trip. I literally couldn't stop eating it, or talking about it. the pizza was great, so was the fried calamari/shrimp etc that we had."}
{"text":"Awesome ambience and amazing food. The staff is all kind and accommodating. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is so amazing, took my dad for Father's Day, and needless to say It was a great Father's Day"}
{"text":"Can you say celebrity hot-spot? This is Scottsdale not LA so our \"celebrity's are mostly ball players.    When I was young and single (boo hoo) I remember seeing Charles Barkley, Mark West, Kevin Johnson \"KJ\" and other Phoenix Suns basketball players out and about-everywhere, waaay before Olive and Ivy.   However, looks like ballplayers have found a new place. Last time I was here I saw Dan Majerle-and I heard a European soccer team was here...single ladies?!    The restaurant is dimly lit and modern but elegant and romantic.  Since this is Scottsdale, you could wear jeans and some high heels or shorts and sandals. I've seen men in here with Hawaiian shirts or golf shirts and shorts. Later in the evening I've seen the high heels and tight mini skirts and men with some dinner jackets so it depends on the time of day.  I've been here a few times and if you come for an early dinner you'll see family's.  In the evening, the bar has some standing room around it and on the weekends it can be standing room only.  I've been here a few times and it's hit or miss depending on what's going on in town (convention, golf tournament, etc.)  Dinner is on mark, since my review is a bit overdue, I can't elaborate but I remember thinking it was fabulous! It is a \"Italian\" restaurant but not the typical menu-more Mediterranean.  A huge outdoor patio is wonderful too.  I saw a few smokers out there so during dinner you could walk out for a smokey.    Drinks were a hit too, I had champagne-so you could plan for a Kir Royal and nice appetizer at the bar or stay for dinner.  A live DJ playing some great tunes has been here on the weekends when I was here.   Located next to Scottsdale Fashion Square across from Nordstroms. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Good service, no wait. Food was good. Love the ambiance and the patio is inciting and cozy. Great place for a brunch and glass of wine."}
{"text":"Always love the food here. The server today was friendly and accommodating with our toddler. Try the salmon or sea bass. Just watch out for the construction of the courtyard. It might be noisy and no view. Manager didn't apologize and instead acted like it wasn't a big deal upon arrival. Sometimes a little empathy helps. Overall it wasn't bad since the food was amazing! Just heads up if you're planning an occasion before September."}
{"text":"The service is amazing here. The staff is friendly and genuine. I often pop in to grab a pastry or croissant to go. It's easy and always fresh and delicious. It's reasonable as well...under 5 bucks and I'm satisfied."}
{"text":"I ordered a slice of pizza they call \"the Butcher\". It's a deep dish style pizza with pepperoni, sausage and bacon- delicious. The bread was super soft and it had a lot of meat and cheese. The place is small but spacious. You don't have to worry about bumping your carry-on with the chairs and tables, or with other guests. They have space where you can charge your electronic devices, which is the main reason why I decided to stop by in the first place. What I liked the most about this place was that the manager walks around asking people how their food is. He also helps clean up, which I thought shows a lot. Great customer service! Next time I stop at PHX I will definitely stop at Olive & Ivy again."}
{"text":"30 minutes til my flight leaves.  I'm returning from a vacation filled with throwing down fat, sugar, and the worst kind of calories.  Thank you Olive & Ivy for providing me a quick and healthy option.  I got a basic salad, but opted to pay $2 to add grilled chicken.    The line went quickly, so I was able to sit down at a table and inhale my salad.  Protein, greens, I didn't feel as sick at myself as I was previously.  Far from great food, but I was satisfied.  More importantly, my body was happier with me for the time being.  At just about $9, It did not pack too much of a punch to my wallet either, for airport food pricing.  Meh, pretty standard.  The sandwiches looked decent, but a little thin on the meats.  So I'm glad I went with the salad and added the chicken - maybe about 6 oz worth.  I was able to plug in my phone charger here and get a little more juice before jumping on the plane too."}
{"text":"Very trendy place. Interesting combination of flavors and textures. They have private rooms for parties or larger groups. Knowledgeable wine suggestions. Service was great."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Service, atmosphere, food, all was wonderful. Probably one of the best meals I've had in the past month."}
{"text":"Very good food, small portions for entrees. I went yesterday along with 3 friends at 7:30pm and put our name down for a table (yes there was a wait on a Tuesday, good sign huh? lol) after about 15/20 minutes we were seated and immediately asked for our drink orders (prompt!) Now I really love the service and the ambience (& my Mediterranean salad!) but this place can only receive 3 stars from me. The chef that night had a bit of a heavy hand when it came to the salt because my friend commented on how salty the bread was and then when I received my entree (veal and spinach ravioli) I was taken aback by how salty and small the portion was. Luckily we ordered lamb meatballs as a small plate and I had a half salad during the meal or else I would have left unsatisfied by the cost related to portion size. But I MUST marvel about the Mediterranean salad, it's been a while since I've had a really good fresh salad and Olive & Ivy's Mediterranean salad + shrimp did the job for me but everything else I ate (meatballs and ravioli) plus my red wine sangria were just like my review states, a 2.5/3. I won't write them off completely though, I'm going to say that was just a freak one time incident (so I can go back and get my salad!) haha"}
{"text":"Recently had both dinner and Sunday brunch there.  The bread & pesto is soft, salty and delicious and while I had the lasagna which wasn't anything to write home about, the risotto was to.die.for  Sunday brunch we sat at the bar and were served by Nick the bartender. The bloody Mary's are made with fresh vegetable juice and lots of horseradish. Not for the faint of heart but clearly a popular beverage there.  My dining companions and I all had the gyro for lunch which was quite tasty.  Looking forward to dining there again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"In love.  Olive and Ivy is a fantastic little place tucked in the waterfront at Scottsdale. They have two sides to choose from, the take out side where it's more of a bistro style, offering sandwiches and salads for a quick meal...and then the elegantly decorated dine in side that has TONS of outdoor seating. This place is gorgeous.  The bar is a great place for happy hour after work or to meet up with friends before a night out...and the restaurant itself offers AMAZING table side mimosas and brunch on the weekends. Delish. Absolutely delish.  If you haven't been here, get here quickly and enjoy every bite and minute of your visit."}
{"text":"I popped into this spot with a small group of people for their \"after dinner hours\" bar set-up.  The interior is very chic and they open up the side doors so that you can enjoy the amazing weather both from the inside or the outdoor patio.  I can imagine the dining experience is wonderful but I have yet to return because the chaos surrounding the bar did turn me off.  It took us about 30 minutes to even got close enough to the bar to start a drink order.  Granted, it was a weekend but with an establishment this large they need more servers (maybe some called in sick that night).   The next thing that turned me off was the overabundance of the pretentious patrons.  I am told that  Britney Spears has dined here in the past.  I guess I was supposed to be impressed by that but all it did was make me wanna throw up a little in my mouth.    I should actually come here for a meal once and see how I like it .  Maybe the bar thing just isn't my scene.  However, I do give them kudos for the outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"Two stars for atmosphere only. Food is truly subpar. Lots of breaded crap. Save your money and hit up The Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy never disappoints.  The outdoor patio is the perfect meeting point for girlfriends or that special someone.  The Happy Hour with the bruchetta ( I recommend the one with fig) is always good and the people watching provides built in entertainment.  They are serious about their food here and I would recommend the brunch as well as dinner.  Definitely a \"go to\" spot."}
{"text":"Truly a  memorable meal! Chicken flat bread, Mediterranean salad, salmon roasted potato and beet molasses glazed and the show stopper, peanut butter mouse enveloped in a chocolate shell. Even the iced tea was nuanced. We sat on the patio under shade trees overlooking the canal and were served by a congenial attentive waiter, Edward Chugerman. A lovely experience all around!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch places in old town Scottsdale. The mimosas are perfect -- almost all champagne with a splash of OJ (just the way I like it). They also give you complimentary focaccia & pesto -- so good! My personal favorite brunch items are the Mediterranean salad w/ chicken ; the Gyro ; and the breakfast sandwich.   Side note: I only come here for brunch because once I came for dinner & was pretty disappointed.. got the sea bass (~$25) & it was not very good. instead of a whole piece of fish it was like little spears of it with very little flavor :/ if I did come for dinner again I would probably stick with a salad or flatbread."}
{"text":"I'm a fan, but doesn't mean I will be back anytime soon. I better not.  This place could be dangerous for my health.   Olive and Ivy is located in Phoenix' Sky Harbor Airport.  Most airport restaurants lack quality, taste, portions, and good prices.  The menu here consist of Italian food mainly pizza's and sandwiches.  Here's what makes me a fan, the prices are pretty good and the portions are fairly big.  This place gets busy and because everything is cooked to order, there's usually a line of impatient people catching a flight.   As for the food, I ended up getting their pepperoni and sausage pizza.  This was so good, thick deep dish, and very tasty.  Probably one of the better fast food type pizzas I have had in a very long time.  Pepperoni and Sausage:   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/olive-and-ivy-marketplace-phoenix?select=UQi6AYXvTrxBFRBG0Axt3w#UQi6AYXvTrxBFRBG0Axt3w"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service, reasonable prices, convenient parking. Don't forget a scoop of gelato for dessert."}
{"text":"I can't rave enough about Olive & Ivy. At the recommendation from my broker, my mother and I went out to celebrate my move to Scottsdale. We walked up and were in awe of the high ceilings, the open floor plan, marketplace area, and really modern decor. We had made a reservation and headed out to the patio. The patio is sectioned off in to two sections: one as more of a lounge with big chairs and couches, while the other is more dining-appropriate. As we were seated the overhead lightbulb strands lit up along the waterfront, I was in absolute heaven. If I had been nervous about my move, this little setting put me completely at ease.       Our waiter (which I shall call the Lord of all Waiters) came to bring us water and ask if we wanted anything to drink, we had both decided on Sangria, and he encouraged us to get a pitcher--I always enjoy an enabler. While he brought back our pitcher and delicious, but not Too sweet Sangria, we ordered the Artichoke heart appetizer. He even had this split for us so we didn't have to portion the starter ourselves. The hand grated Parmesan, Artichoke hearts and arugula were outstanding. Both my mother and I had already started commenting on the greatness of the flavor combinations.        The Lord of Waiters stopped by frequently, asking about my trip, checking on our waters, refilling our Sangria as it got low, talking about Downtown Scottsdale....he really knew how to make us feel special. He then brought us house-made pesto and bread; I could've eaten the pesto as a meal in and of itself it was so fresh.         Finally, our entrees came out. My mother got the Sweet Potato Cannelloni while I opted to try the Sea Bass. As I ate my snow peas, sea bass and grapefruit combo in absolute contentment, I caught myself humming along to The Notorious B.I.G. this is when the greatest waiter of all time told us they have a DJ every night that spins great mixes (which I can attest to, I was constantly saying \"I love this song!\")      To top off our extravagant meal, we had a scoop of Vanilla Bean gelato to split. The Vanilla Bean was upfront, not overpowering but just right. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect meal (or waiter). I can't wait to start getting visitors so I can take them here and show this place off!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. Great flatbreads, awesome happy hour. Go for brunch and get their delicious spicy bloody mary.  I've been here more than I've actually checked in via Yelp. Service has always been top notch and the food is consistently good. Did I say they have good flatbreads? They're awesome. Large portions, so don't order too much or you'll be going home with lots of leftovers.  Hummus is good, and oh I forgot to mention the baked items. Fresh breads and the cinnamon rolls are TO DIE FOR. Get there early and get them warmed up. The rolls go pretty fast so don't be surprised if they sell out.  This place is a little hard to find, but definitely worth looking for."}
{"text":"I first came to Olive and Ivy back in 2006. I have come back consistently several times every year, and it never fails to impress. Great service, cool vibe, superb food, and a beautiful setting. Such a good place to go and one of the best restaurants in Scottsdale. Keep doing what you are doing and you will always have my custom! Thanks team."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great food and great service, loved it and will come back soon.  Thank you for a delicious FREE desert ( double bake chocolate cake) it was perfect they way I like it ( not to sweet).  I loved the bread and the pesto spread, yum!  The veal ravioli was excellent, but a bit to salty for my taste. The beet salad was perfect, the lasagna was excellent and the red sangria was good but not great."}
{"text":"Found out the DJ there on Saturdays spins trip hop! RJD2, Pretty Lights, Bonobo, Kill Paris, Layo & Bushwacka and so much more. If you don't know what I'm talking about, go check it out. You will kick yourself for not knowing about this genre of music earlier."}
{"text":"Salads, sandwiches and soups even.  This isn't mind blowing but darn good.  Wish I could add more but honestly I see this as a staple, noting special or out of ordinary in any other way."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. Everytime we went here, we had a awesome time. Their food is one of the top class. I only had one bad service when our server disappeared for a while. Considering we visit here more than 20times, it is just small mistake. It is well over-priced but the quality is excellent. The indoor and outdoor seats r also very great. They even have small room that accomodate 20 plus people. If u want to try many things out, come after 5pm so that u can enjoy many delicious main dishes. Personally, i love their steak. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"A great place to celebrate my birthday! Great food snd s fun drink menu.  If you want to be on their hugh patio be sure to make that known when you make reservations.  Inside was nice but the DJ makes sure you can't hear anything!  Very loud. Food great.  Loved the wild mushroom pappardelle and the lasagna was flavorful. Stu took good care of us.  If you're a lemon lover try the lemon pudding cake with burnt honey gelato.  It was worth the 30 min. Drive."}
{"text":"This place has great customer service. They have delicious cactus tea and iced americanos. Their parfait are so yummy too but I do wish they made them a bit smaller. Their food was delicious. The side potatoes are very soft with enough crisp to them. Breakfast burrito was a bit too much for me, but it was still tasty."}
{"text":"Food is OK, but it has a distinct chain restaurant feel that you might expect from a Fox restaurant, which has about 50 location in Arizona and a few other Western states. The service was good, and the food wasn't bad, but if you don't want to feel like you're at a Cheesecake Factory, I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is fabulous, but the food can be hit or miss! I had my graduation party here and the food was just ok. However, I've eaten here before and the food was very good!"}
{"text":"Great place and friendly service made for a great anniversary dinner. Zach was phenomenal and very professional and the food tasted incredible. I also enjoyed the casual atmosphere as well as how the place was lit. I'm not a fan of bright rooms. Awesome experience overall. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance, wonderful service, decent wine list, and flavorful dishes.  The salmon and mashed potatoes are to die for!  There sangria is also very good... this is one of the few places I have found that doesn't over-sugar or water down the drink. Solid choice for a romantic date or to catch up with friends.   Our favorite waiter remembers to bring out separate dishes for the pesto dip (delish!).  It really is the little things that make a place stand out!  Only downside is the drink orders can take +10 minutes.  If you are in a hurry don't eat here.  Live a little, relax, and enjoy the meal.  It is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Stopped into Olive and Ivy for the first time yesterday and one of the first things I said to my boyfriend was \"why haven't we been here before?\"  Since we were there early, we decided to sit in the bar section of the patio and order off the happy hour menu. The food menu consists of a few different bruschettas, flatbreads and a couple other small bites.   We chose two bruschettas, bacon wrapped dates and a flatbread pizza with sausage. Everything was really tasty.  The pizza was the perfect size for two people to share. And the dates, stuffed with sausage, were fantastic! I highly recommend those! All in all it made for a great light(ish) dinner.  Everything from the atmosphere to the food to the service was great. The only weird thing was that they have an air freshener on the tree we were sitting under that squirts out air freshener at times. My boyfriend got sprayed quite heavily at one point - yuck! But regardless, we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place kinda surprised me.  Took my daughter last night Sunday for her 25thbday dinner. party of 15. The waiter was not on the ball at all   first off he dropped a beer on my back/chair and purse. We had to ask twice to start w bread and pesto. We had to refill our own water glasses. And to top all off charged me for her bday cookie & ice-cream. (not slice of cake)  I was expecting some compensation or free dessert or even a gesture from the manager.  Not so much."}
{"text":"Such a fun place for a date night or out with the girlfriends! The food is good and the atmosphere is fun. I love Olive and Ivy! Trendy and a little pricy but a fun night out."}
{"text":"Went here for my bday dinner bc I had some ppl in town. Service is horrible. Food was good. If the service was better the food wouldn't have been a big deal ! Has a cute look/vibe though!"}
{"text":"I came here for restaurant week. I paid less than 50 bucks for an appetizer, main course, dessert and a glass of chardonnay. That's such a good deal.   As far as the food goes, it was very fresh. I ordered a Mediterranean salad with a serving of chicken. The chicken did not come with the restaurant week deal. However, it was just a small extra charge on my bill. It's worth it. The chicken on the salad was so tender.  For my main course I ordered the salmon. It was so tender and so juicy. I got my salmon medium. As far as dessert, I ordered their peanut butter mousse. It was like eating a peanut butter cup! Yum!   I'm addition, I ordered the beet salad. I liked the beet salad way better than their Mediterranean salad. The beet was so fresh and so juicy. The arugula was peppery and crisp. The dressing was creamy and sweet.  I recommend this restaurant! It serves great food with great service!"}
{"text":"Met a business associate here for happy hour.  Although the place was busy, our server was very attentive and nice.  The appetizers we sampled were quite tasty and the wine smooth and silky.  Enjoyed sitting out on the patio on a beautiful Arizona afternoon"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere but the food is so so. Drinks are good tho! If you can get a spot on to patio it's so worth it. Bruschetta is my fav food and their pesto bread dip!"}
{"text":"Looking for a perfect spot in old town for great atmosphere, good service and a hip menu. This is it! We always try to sit on the water side patio. Just a favorite spot for any occasion. We have had company dinners, family brunch, late nite hot cocoa. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy EQUALS utter bliss.   Highlights for Erin on Saturday evening:  1. Door immediately held open for me and a nice, warm welcome 2. Immediate seating (sans servervations) at Chef's Table - which held my attention quite nicely w/my adult onset ADD 3. Pleasant server who sincerely looked like she loved her job 4. Frequent check-ins without being a pestering fly 5. GREAT food (I had the chopped salad w/chicken) and smooth champs served in a gorgeous flute 6. Fab ppl watching 7. Packed restaurant, but acoustics worked well as I could still maintain a good volley of conversation w/my friend."}
{"text":"My favorite place for any meal! I always take anyone who comes in town to this place. Love breakfast, brunch, lunch AND dinner here."}
{"text":"I was not all that impressed with dinner.  For me it's a more enjoyable spot for happy hour, drinks & a few appetizers.  The White Peach & Hibiscus margarita is absolutely delicious.  Go during happy hour, get 50% off, then you won't feel like it was such a waste/rip-off!"}
{"text":"I really dig this place.  Awesome decor, great mood lighting, really tasty menu, expansive wine list.  It's kind of an upscale take on mediterrenean food.  i had the chicken (which was perfectly juicy & tasty) with parmesan risotto & asparagus.  pretty good all the way around.  i'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Great food service and atmosphere. Reasonable pricing.  Wanted to find a nice local restaurant w atmosphere for our last night in Scottsdale. Made reservations for 6:15 on a Thursday and arrived early-- no problem. It did become more crowded quickly.we sat outside on a very pleasant large patio. Service was great. Menu was not huge but food was very good. Especially notable was the Mediterranean salad and the sweet potato cannelloni. Cannelloni was rich and unique. Though my hubby thought it was too sweet. He had mushroom flatbread he thought was awesome. Two in our party had great filling lasagna. We had gelato and brown butter almond cake for dessert. All five in our party gave this place high reviews."}
{"text":"Been here many times due to location and great patio.  First the good: Location, location, location. Right in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale by Fashion Square and the Canal. The restaurant looks the part, has an amazing patio covered by massive shade trees alongside the canal. There are cleverly hidden scent sprayers in the event the canal or the many birds in the neighborhood emanate a less desirable scent.   Service is fairly good. Young, good looking people are cast to fulfill the part of waiters and most play their part well. Our waitress for lunch yesterday was super, the one we had a few weeks go would have rather been elsewhere and we left early.   Now the mediocre: I would call it the food. If you have been to one Fox Restaurant Concept eatery you've been to all. In a sense it brings a certain level of comfort knowing that you'll have similar food in the different restaurants of the company; I wish however that each restaurant did a better job differentiating itself by offering more varied food choices.  And last but not least, the bad: The restaurant, and all of the company's restaurants really, are build for turning tables in their dining rooms. It is virtually impossible to have a conversation because it is so loud inside. The patio is more forgiving.   Basically, Olive and Ivy looks the part, has decent service with run of the mill food. If you want to see an be seen in this neighborhood its the place to be."}
{"text":"Pros: service was quick. Takes credit cards.   Cons: not as good as the actual restaurant! At the actual restaurant, I usually get the bacon wrapped dates and ravioli. Nothing like that here. I wasn't a huge fan of the roast beef sandwich. Hard and dry."}
{"text":"Pros: My favorite restaurant in AZ. I have never ordered anything that I haven't enjoyed. Nothing tops their pesto sauce. The best part is, it comes free with the bread at the beginning of the meal. Last night, I ordered the sweet potato cannelloni. It's very rich. My friend described it as, \"Like eating a dessert.\" Since I have a sweet tooth, I loved it. My sister order the pork tenderloin. Her friend ordered the chicken scallopine. It paired perfectly with my past. My BFF ordered scallops. Cooked to perfection. Like eating light puffy clouds of air.   Cons: Price"}
{"text":"Incredible service and incredible food. Artisan drinks. I asked the manager where I could get aloe Vera for our burnt 10 year old that just finished mermaid school at the Phoenician and they went to the store and brought us aloe Vera! I was incredibly impressed that Melissa Conti went out of her way for us. I was hoping to Postmates aloe to us before we left. Once Melissa said it was on the way it allowed me to relax and enjoy my first night off in a month. I will be back and will definitely recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for brunch on Sunday and it was amazing. Everything is made from scratch and it shows. I had the breakfast sandwich (egg, bacon, cheese, avocado,  add tomato) and it was fantastic. Add the bottomless mimosas and charmingly attentive waiter and I could have sat and chatted all morning. We'll be back for certain."}
{"text":"The sweet potato cannelloni was SO delicious! It might as well have been a dessert with how sweet it was! We also had three bruschetta: the strawberry and apple, prosciutto and fig, and the fresh mozzarella. They were all yummy but the fresh mozzarella was magical! The tomato jam on it was the best tomato jam I have ever had. Loved this place and I will definitely be going back! :)"}
{"text":"Spent our first night in Scottsdale enjoying a great meal at Olive and Ivy.  Our waiter ranked up there with some of the best we've ever had.   He was extremely friendly and attentive.  The wine selection was top notch and we actually found some of our favorite Italian wines.   A few of us had the Bouillabaisse which was amazing and I highly recommend.   The place was very busy on a very nice AZ night but we were well taken care of."}
{"text":"Well??? Let's see???? Where to start??? Had a reservation for 3, myself, my girl, and my mom (she was celebrating her birthday), So, Sat, 6:15 reservation, we show up prompt at 6:14. They seat us right away, and I'm excited, as is Kiri my girlfriend as we have already read the menu. The place is way tricked out cool, in décor!!! but strike #1 very high celling's, making for an extremely loud dinning experience. However the booths are nice, the lightings very cool, but oh yeah strike #2, my eyes are pretty good as far as sight & I'm somber, but even w/readers & my led smart phone flashlight, it's still very hard to read the menu??? Now you must understand that I have an onion allergy and if you do??? listen UP!: Starting with the apps, everyone of them contains onions of some sort & can not... I repeat CAN NOT BE PREPARED WITH OUT? WTF??? On do second course salads: every dressing is made with onions and your ONLY options is oil & vinegar??? Oh yeah!!! YIPPIE!!! I'm having a blast! strike ###3, but it got better, now I digress, Assuming now that our sever knows the allergy exist, we attempt to move on to main course: first up chicken scaloppini I order, Kiri orders scallops, and my mom, like me, chicken scaloppini, 10 mins pass, server comes back, and states that my dish has onions in the sauce, I say ok....what can we do??? she shrugs... IDK???? I ask her to please go back and ask the Chef what they can do??? 5min later, she comes back and says: \"the chef say's all the sauces, puree's/grays have onion\", but still no word on what we can do??? I ask again, she say's IDK??? I'm like WTF??? please get me a menu so I can try and make another selection??? DuH! Now the table has been held up at least 30 mins??? Finally, she tells me I can have the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin on a bed of spaghetti squash!!!! YUM!!!! I ORDER! YES!!! 10mins later the manager walks up and says \"hi I guess there was a problem??? I say, no we got it worked out. I'm allergic to onions, but the server got me on track with the pork tenderloin!!! He said \"NO\" It has onions in the squash???? WTF!!!! many mins go by, he gets it straight w/a potato puree instead, which I was told had onions, GEEZZZZ anyone still keeping up? Because only now does everything go down hill. Plates all come, my tenderloin that I ordered mid well (that slightly pink about 160deg internal temp inside, is all pink and bloody juice on plate....NO! Kiri's scallops are4 tiny scallops the size of a .50cent piece three seared only on one side and one not seared on either side and chilly cold in the middle???? WTF!!! we have to send our two plates back for do over.... \"RE-FIRE\" meanwhile, they leave my moms on the table for 15min and she waits for our food to return, only to have her's go cold....WTF! YOU THINK A PLACE LIKE THAT WOULD HAVE PULLED ALL THREE PLATES AND RETURNED THEM ALL HOT TOGETHER? I'm in the business and just call them as I see them???? SAVE YOUR MONEY!"}
{"text":"We went to this beautiful restaurant on Mother's Day to have brunch.  Not only did the manager call another restaurant to get a high chair for our 6 month old son, but also carried an umbrella to keep him out of the 88 degree sunshine.  The outdoor seating, amazing beverages and tasty menu is just the cherry on top of this classy restaurant.  Management= 5* Service = 5* Ambiance = 5* Food = 5* Experience = 5*"}
{"text":"The food here is exceptional. I love the vibe in the people. The waitress was so nice and spot-on when she recommend the food to us. We will be back again this is the third time that we've been here. Might be the best restaurant we've been to in Phoenix. Don't forget to order dessert!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Olive & Ivy a couple times now, and the food is great.  from the ambiance of the restaurant to the smiling and helpful service, this place cant be beat if you want to try something \"out of the norm\" and tantalize your taste-buds.  This is a great place to have happy hour with tomato cheese flatbread or hummus, or a romantic date."}
{"text":"Had the best risotto of my life.  Must try the shrimp risotto!  Great atmosphere, people that work there are amazing."}
{"text":"The restaurant has more options, of course. This was good for a late night pizza snack. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Cool vibe with excellent service. Food is fancy and the price reflects it. SamFox Restaurants are generally better than this though. Meh."}
{"text":"TL;DR - great food, beautiful interior.   On a recent trip to Arizona, Olive & Ivy was on my bucket list. (As any respectable Yelp Elite would, I did my homework.)  We had two plates of bruschetta trios, and three of the six arrived wrong; one was a completely different toast that we didn't order, the salmon Lox one had no Lox (hello...! Haha), etc. Errors aside, they were incredibly good. We agreed we could have easily just had those for our meal and been fine.   We also got two salads - Caesar and Mediterranean with chicken - and they were good.   The house bread never came, although we were told it was coming, so I can't comment on that.  Our waiter was quick and attentive, but there were plenty of mistakes in a small number of dishes.   Even still, we'd be back. We could have stayed here for hours!"}
{"text":"The food is great. The service is great. The atmosphere is great. Oh yeah, the wine list is good too. Sit outside if it's under 100."}
{"text":"this place is great!  it has a marketplace, gelato stand, and a wonderfully large restaurant with an open kitchen. there were 6 of us that dined for brunch and we all ordered different entrees.  everyone loved their meals (Benedict, French toast, flatbreads, biscuits & gravy); I personally had the tuna salad sandwich with potato salad which was super delicious!   bloody mary's & service were good as well!"}
{"text":"I always have a good time here with good service! Seating outside is fabulous by the fire but unless you have a big party then you may be sitting with people you don't know! Since its open seating. Great food presentation and I enjoy the interior decor. This is one of my favorite places in Scottsdale to eat because of the vibe! Will keep coming back!! Trendy and fun."}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy is my favorite Fox Restaurant. I absolutely love their salmon. Although I must say, everything I've had there is delicious. Moreover, the atmosphere is great, especially the patio."}
{"text":"Wow what a great brunch.  Great wait staff. The design and ambiance was brilliant. Damn good bloody marry.  All and all it was a great start to a day with my family. Eggs benedict FTW!"}
{"text":"This is a hipster place with great atmosphere and pretty good food. The service was good considering they were really busy, all the employees were extremely friendly. I got the fungi trifoliate flatbread with a glass of red wine and my aunt got the duck confit flatbread with the red sangria. She raves about the sangria which has a nice tartness to it. Our flatbreads would have been amazing if they hadn't been so burned. You expect flatbread to be a little black around the edges, but I'm talking completely burnt around the entire edges. Bummer. If not for that I would've given the place five stars."}
{"text":"Another Happy Hour...headed to the waterfront to shop and ended up here. Right near the other Fox restaurant, Culinary Dropout, but menu totally different. Not so special specials, beer was $5. We also got hummus to share and also ordered a salad off the regular menu, which were good. I like the cleanliness and service of these restaurants. Not my fave but nothing wrong with that."}
{"text":"I'm so excited about this place and I couldn't even wait to write a review... I'm still eating!!    My daughter and I are waiting for the mall to open so we decided to find a breakfast spot nearby.  Came across this place and gave it a shot.  At 10:30am on a Sunday I expected a long wait but was surprised that we were seated right away in a great spot outside along the water.    Waiter was great, friendly and knowledgeable but perhaps had a bit of ADD, he kept getting distracted but it was okay because he was still great.    After listening to our waiters explanation of the menu, I opted for the breakfast sandwich with a side of hollandaise sauce and my daughter got the cheddar biscuits and gravy.    We got the complimentary bread and pesto, which was to die for!  My sandwich was amazing!  The bread was a buttery flaky goodness and everything was cooked to perfection!  The biscuits and gravy were unique and amazing too!  And to top it off, as we were finishing up our meal, our waiter brought out refills and had them in to go cups.  Awesome!  He knew we were going shopping and thought we needed some refreshments for the mall.    This is going on my list of favorites!  Beautiful atmosphere, superb food and friendly people.  What more could you ask for???"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Our waiter was named donavon and he was on point. I ate way to much but it was so good i couldn't help myself. Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"First time i am giving a Fox Restaurant such a low rating.  Really was not at all impressed by the dishes. My food was in the luke warm family when i got it. I really don't mind luke warm food. It's nice cause i can just start eating with out worrying about scalding my face. (wish it was a little bit warmer though).   I got the veal raviolis and shrimp ontop (as recommend by the server).  Shrimp was overcooked... :\, ravioli was just okay... I wasn't really blown away by it. Veal tasted dry inside...is that possible with ravioli?   I tried the rest of my parties dishes and i wasn't blown away. Maybe my expectations have become too high of the fox restaurants.  I will chalk it up to a bad night at the restaurant. I'd give them a second try because all the other fox restaurants i have been to, i've enjoyed.   But out of this experience it was a 3.  :\"}
{"text":"Beautiful location & great for breakfast or brunch. The bread served with freshly made pesto is a bonus, and the patio is lovely when the weather isn't too hot (not much shade). It gets busy during spring/spring training/weekends/etc. Good to make a reservation. The decor is really neat."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Not only is the atmosphere and decor amazing and beautiful, but the food is to die for! I had the salmon and I am dead serious when I say it was the best salmon I've had in my life! I also had the coconut sponge cake as dessert and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"We had our work holiday party here and we can't wait to come back and enjoy it again. We were greeted with a large wine selection and some appetizers on a back patio. The appetizers were mini pizza/bruschetta - some had mushrooms and some has tomatoes with cheese. Both were delicious. Another appetizer was a date wrapped in bacon - this was super delicious and easy to eat. I ordered a pineapple mojito and at first our server was confused, saying they don't have a blender but could make us a raspberry mojito. (I've had bartenders tell me they don't have blenders when I've ordered mojitos before, so I was used to this.) Luckily, our server came back later telling me she was confused and viola a delicious pineapple mojito was placed in my hands with a large slice of pineapple on the rim. It was amazing! So good, the husband had to order one for himself. Our party moved inside to a private room where we were given tiny menus with simple selections. The husband ordered the beef entree, steak with horseradish mashed potatoes and I ordered the scallops with corn polenta. While the scallops were delicious, the steak was super tender and moist! (Better than a fillet we had the night before!) For desert, I ordered the chocolate cake with coffee crema inside and the husband ordered the cheesecake. The cheesecake came in a cute mason jar and was amazing. I really liked my chocolate cake but the cheesecake was better. For once everything the husband ordered was better than what I had ordered! It was a fantastic party and such a great venue. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy-great location and the food is amazing. i am a vegeterian and requested something from the chef that he could make and a summer squash medley came out and it was great. Really great and friendly staff. I love the enviroment as well, dim lighting and great conversation seating."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Olive and Ivy for years but never made it there - finally the opportunity to meet a girlfriend for lunch today arose and it was finally time!  We shared the bruschetta to start, a trio that you choose from a list. We chose the sautéed mushrooms, butternut squash with brussel sprouts and the third was a fresh mozzarella with tomato jam. All three were great and soooo flavorful. I LOVE Postinos but this was a nice change and new flavors.  For my meal I had the Mediterranean salad and added grilled shrimp. Again a delicious choice that I was happy with.   I'd definitely recommend Olive and Ivy to anyone :)"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my mother and we had the most amazing experience! We sat on the patio which was such a pleasant environment. The serve was great and the food outstanding. Their complimentary bread and pesto dip is so delicious to start with. We also got flatbread and the Melo salad - both fresh and (believe it or not) refreshing!  A little pricey so I can't come too often, but will be back for special occasions!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere, food and drinks!! This place was my favorite in Scottsdale.   Definitely sit outside.   Friendly and knowledgeable wait staff.  We shared the Mediterranean salad...delicious!!   I had the mushroom pappardelle and my boyfriend had the bacon wrapped pork.   Both were excellent.  Don't forget your drinks!! We had white sangria and Mediterranean mule.  Cannot wait to visit AZ again and eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Good was great but the people working there were so rude and unpleasant....their attitudes ruined my experience."}
{"text":"If you have a thing for Italian and Mediterranean then this is your place! Come hungry, this place oozes freshness in all that they offer from the Fresh Baked Focaccia with Pesto to their flatbreads and pasta options.  Ambiance: Hip trendy vibes. Service staff is extremely helpful and nice. If it's not too hot, sit outside on the patio it's a beautiful view.  Recommendations: Bruchetta (Mushroom and Roasted Garlic- Finger Licking good, I mean it!) and Prosciutto and Fig, Molte Bene! Pesto Chicken Flatbread is packed with flavor and not too heavy. Pasta: You must get the Wild Mushroom Pappardelle- It's amazing, it has truffle, herbs and Parmesan cheese (sorry folks it has no meat, but a well done dish) highly recommend it. It's pack with flavor, and if you are a truffle fan this is a must.  I can't go back soon enough! Make a trip to Camelback Rd to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Solid cafe style option when you've dropped from all the shopping nearby.  My only complaint is that lamb gyro featured lamb sausage patties instead of the long strips you expect in a gyro.  Nice taste but I wish this had been advertised.  Breakfast potatoes were very good.  The salads are huge; like maybe a whole bag that you buy at the grocery store in a bowl."}
{"text":"I am so sad that I have to give this restaurant a bad rating. I took my mom here to have a fabulous Mother's day dinner and to have a delightful finale to our mother-daughter trip. The food and the service were fabulous. We started with three different bruschetta (you can mix). They were all amazing. We then had the house salad which had a wonderful light dressing, all very fresh. We split the salad and the portions were still huge! For dinner I had the sweet potato cannelloni and my mom had fish (I can't remember which one and I can't view the menu).   Why the bad review you might ask? My mom woke up at 6am with HORRIFIC FOOD POISONING. I felt so awful, we even had to fly out that day. She was miserable. Some might say that food poisoning can happen even when cooking in your own home and that its not their fault but I find it inexcusable. Keeping ingredients fresh, the kitchen clean and correct cooking temps should avoid all food poisoning. We ate and shared the same dishes all day for breakfast and lunch so I know that it was from Olive and Ivy. Could have been the fish or the lettuce. We were skeptical about getting fish in Arizona in the first place but my mom decided to go for it....bad choice :("}
{"text":"I didn't try any food but I did enjoy the fire pit and the s'more latte.  Great date spot and friendly staff."}
{"text":"After a lukewarm visit a bit ago, this visit was much better.  This eatery fills up fast so there are a few options for those on the go.  Sit at the bar or order from the take out.  The watermelon salad should not be missed.  Sandwiches have unique and delicious assembled layers and sauces.  Many salads are a tasteful choice for the Paleo diet--add salmon on the side."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, why can't they fix the service?  ...and yet, I keep returning to torture my guests and me.  One would think that at 3:00 in the afternoon, there would be no issues.  We had a business meeting and decided to sit on the patio which was, despite being a perfect day in the valley, empty.  Once seated, it took 25 minutes for 3 ice teas, another 30 minutes for the prosciutto and chevre flat bread (which, oops, had no chevre), and another 30 minutes for the bill.  Our business meeting was only an hour in an attempt to avoid rush hour traffic home...we failed miserably at the task.  Anyway, Olive and Ivy still receives 4 stars from me because of their food and ambiance.  Just be prepared to wait and be served something you didn't order.  Sam Fox, fix this place before you open another."}
{"text":"We have been to Olive & Ivy many times. The bar is great at lunchtime and the patio is our favorite at night. The wine list is very adequate and the food selections are fresh and attractively presented. Our favorite appetizer is the hummus with veggies. Dinner selections are all good. I am partial to the chicken offerings and I can't fail to mention the bread and pesto.  Servers have always been great, very attentive and efficient."}
{"text":"Good food in Terminal 4, right inside the gate. Seating is normally a problem, it's limited and there isn't a lot of extra seating at the gates so folks linger in the restaurants and use their electronics.  The coffee and pastries are terrific and the breakfast food looks marvelous."}
{"text":"Treated  Mom to an early Mother's day celebration at Olive & Ivy. We enjoyed the ambience and decor of the restaurant. Everything is well spread out, so you don't feel isolated, or crammed in at your table. The food was good, and tasted fresh. Our server was efficient, and attentive to us through the whole meal. Over all a GREAT experience."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Would never recommend.   Background: I was here as part of a bridal party, and the problems began right away. We had enough people coming that we were not allowed to place a reservation outside. Fine. We'd just make do with open seating on the patio. There were 4 of us in our late 20s/early 30s that arrived first. I guess we made a mistake and had too many seats around our table. Rather than just politely explain it to us, our server snapped at us and kicked the chair out of her way. After we apologized, moved things, and fixed it, it took 15 minutes before she'd come back to take our drink order despite standing nearby. When we placed our order for our first round of drinks, we started by asking if we could please split our check. We were told we were only allowed to split our check for food and drinks if she took all of our credit cards, but combined with other comments she made, it was meant to ensure we'd actually pay (to be clear, we'd just asked to split our 4 orders into 2 sets of 2). By this point, more of the group was showing up, primarily some of the older relatives who proceeded to sit at a different table; we later found out that she had no problem splitting the check at this other table (perhaps trying to guarantee she gets at least one automatic gratuity?). She proceeded to completely ignore us and wouldn't bring any more water or anything except to the older members of our party. When we all ultimately ordered our food, we also ordered another round of drinks, yet somehow our drinks only came out at the same time as our food (as in, much later). My food was also a little on the cold side. To be perfectly honest, we suspected at the time that she was irritated that us younger couples were splitting meals and not each ordering one. We still had to flag down anyone that passed by just to be given water.   In the sake of fairness, here are some positives about the place. The décor, particularly outside, was gorgeous. If you told them you were splitting food, it comes out pre-split (hopefully you were planning on splitting all parts 50-50). The food itself was also pretty good (albeit with small portion sizes).  Overall, spend your money elsewhere, particularly if you look younger. If you still choose to go here, prepare to be treated poorly and ignored while paying too much for small portions."}
{"text":"I have a couple of issues with this place, so I will start with the food first. Myself and my wife met a couple friends here for brunch last weekend. I made the mistake of ordering the \"Potato Hash\", which turned out to be one of the worst things I've ever eaten period. It's a simple breakfast of eggs over easy, sausage gravy and hash brown potato's. My plate came out with two eggs that had been cooked so long that they were both hard and dry. There wasn't a lick of moisture left in them. The server noticed that the eggs were ruined, and promptly had more made for me. The sausage gravy was terrible. It was some weird super oily concoction that neither resembled gravy nor sausage, which made my burnt potato's even worse. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish. My second issue was my reservation. I made a reservation three days in advance for 11:30am on the patio through \"OpenTable\". The day before my reservation the restaurant called to confirm everything for the next day. When we arrived, the hostess quickly seated us inside. I explained that my reservation was for the patio. She told us to wait and she would go find out. Several minutes later she came back and informed me that since I made my reservation through \"OpenTable\", that my request couldn't be honored. WTH? I was told that if you want to sit on the patio, you need to call the restaurant direct, even though on OpenTable there is a box for, wait for it, special requests! Fortunately since I have no desire to return to this typical chain restaurant, I wont need to call the restaurant direct. P.S. I only gave it two stars because of the speed at which the server saw the two hockey pucks on my plate and corrected it."}
{"text":"Just got back from spending the weekend in Scottsdale with my girl friend. We dined at Olive and Ivy on Saturday night and just had an amazing time! It was packed and we didn't have reservation so waited at the bar and enjoyed few cocktails for 30 minutes and then our table was ready.   Located on the 'river' aka waterfront near Scottsdale Fashion SC, Olive & Ivy combines a lively, animated atmosphere and retro and trendy look with comfort of old, nostalgic Arizona dinning.   Fresh Creative food, Great Service and there are multiple Seating Areas; One can seat themselves inside the restaurant in booth, tables or at the bar or outside seating is available as well.   My dinner was fantastic...I ordered the Sea bass with caramelized cauliflower, snap peas & preserved grapefruit. DELICIOUS....My mouth is watering just thinking about it... lol   If you haven't been here, put it on your list and enjoy every bite and minute of your visit."}
{"text":"You order at the counter, and they have a good amount of seating.   I was planning to be healthy and just get a salad, but the squares of pizza sitting under the warming lamp called out to me. I ended up with a pine nut and chicken salad (mixed greens, Gorgonzola, lots of pulled roasted chicken, cherry tomatoes, and toasted pine nuts) and a piece of the Mediterranean pizza.  The salad was fresh and had a good amount of chicken, and the pizza had lots of toppings and good flavor (they also warmed it up for me).  As far as airport food goes, it wasn't crazy expensive (around $18 for the above)."}
{"text":"I see you brought back the mushroom and asparagus flatbread without the asparagus. The service of the staff raised you up, but dude, get rid of the ridiculously tight outfits. The \"fungi\" named flatbread was great though. Bring back the salmon flatbread , get rid of the howdy doody outfits, and I'll give you another star."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for lunch/brunch. They were very accommodating with my active 2-year-old and got his food out within 10 minutes. The food was all excellent and the service was perfect. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great location!  Been here for dinner twice, brunch once.  Dinner is very good.  The espresso poured over ice cream dessert is very unique, and a must try.  For brunch, the vanilla yogurt is AMAZING!  And I hate yogurt.  It is the only yogurt I will eat.  The potato flat bread is only meh.  Long wait times.  Crazy Scottsdale clubbers fill the bar area on weekend nights too; its distracting when trying to have a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Okay, so this review is long overdue!  My husband and I came here as we were spending our day in scottsdale. So we had lunch here for our anniversary in March.  Our waiter was Stephen.  He was very friendly.  We told him that we were celebrating our anniversary and he joked that we looked too young to be married. Haha. Anyway, we both ordered the same thing. I can't recall the exact name but it was a bacon cheeseburger with fries.  We also had margaritas. The waiter said the beef would be cooked meduim. I thought it'll be meduim close to well done but it was meduim rare. I never eat my burgers that way, but didn't think anything of it at the time. Fast forward three, four hours later,  it caused food poisoning.  Maybe it was my fault for eating meduim rare when I never do, but just be cautious if you are like me. The food poisoning was really bad. It caused several days of vomiting and diarrhea.  Apart from that, the waiter was super nice and got us a cake as an anniversary gift (on his tab). We were seated on the verge of outdoors and indoors, so the best of both worlds. We really had a good time so it sucked that I got sick! We will be returning,  though.  It wasn't their fault."}
{"text":"Best place to be outdoors and chat with your Tribe of Women Friends and chat about what to do on girlie Vacation.  Great Breakfast and Brunch."}
{"text":"We came here with some new friends today for brunch after church, I was very impressed with the quality of food, service and atmosphere. The perfect type of place to go for brunch or lunch. I had the breakfast burrito which was great and topped it off with a couple of fresh mimosas!"}
{"text":"The BFF and I decided to have a fancy date night and get dressed up to go to dinner and a movie.  We decided on Olive & Ivy because it was centrally located for us and had a nice ambience.  I made reservations for us because it made it feel more \"date-like\" and also I was going to be coming straight from work and knew I'd be starving.  I got there just about exactly when my reservation was made for and was told to have a seat and my table would be ready shortly.  Now, the place wasn't packed by any means, sure there was a good number of people in the restaurant but there wasn't like a huge group of people waiting around to be seated.  For some reason though, despite the fact that I'd made a reservation, I waited for 15-20 minutes for my table.  So what's the point of making a reservation?  I could have walked in off the street and had the same thing.  Once we got to our table the server came over right away and introduced himself and offered us drinks.  Since my friend is pregnant she was asking about non-alcoholic options but they really didn't have many selections so she stuck with water as did I so as not to feel like I was teasing her by dangling a martini in her face.  We decided to get the 3 bruschetta for $11 deal as an appetizer to tide us over to our main course.  They were all delicious but pretty small, only 3 pieces per slice.  We both decided on the Mediterranean Salad, with hers she asked for it with no feta and a side of olives though.  They were good but not outstanding.  Our server was friendly the whole time and did an awesome job making sure our water was full and we had whatever we needed.  I ended my meal with the passion fruit sorbet which was good at first but the flavor got to be a bit too much after a few bites."}
{"text":"Wonderful Italian cuisine on the river in Scottsdale.  Enjoyed bruschetta sampler and bacon wrapped dates for appetizers.  Both the lasagne and the papardelle with mushrooms dishes were delicious and would be ordered again. Finished with two desserts. The lemon pudding cake was not to our liking, but the cherry pecan danish with orange marmalade and ice cream was terrific. Very good service by the waiter and food runners. Next time we visit Scottsdale will go again."}
{"text":"This was our first stop on our maiden vaca to Scottsdale! We enjoyed the outdoor patio area and seemed to get there right on time as the lunch hour on a beautiful day seemed to fill in quickly. We enjoyed mimosas, a charcuterie board, and 3 bruschettas (goat and fig, salmon lox, + 1 more). Service was great, prices fair, but can't beat the location and ambiance!"}
{"text":"What a delightful atmosphere! Unique, flavorful food and dessert options with attentive yet not overbearing service. This was our first time dining with Olive & Ivy. We will certainly return as well as refer it to our friends."}
{"text":"The Sweet Potato Cannelloni is crazy good! Service was excellent. Their soda machine was down and the server went to their market place and got me a coca cola to make up for it. Really impressed!"}
{"text":"I've been a few times and every time is great!  The flat breads, bruschetta, and salads are great!   Although the best dish they have is the Chopped Chicken Salad.  The peanut butter granola just makes it!!!"}
{"text":"A huge fan of this place.  The patio is by far the most beautiful here.  Actual grass, beautiful fountains, fire pits for chilly nights, and overlooks the waterfront.  Very pretty. But even better is their Happy Hour.  Great drink specials and the bruschetta is cheap for HH as well. While not as fantastic as Postino's bruschetta, it is still delicious.  I've also eaten here for dinner and it's outstanding.  The seafood risotto is unbelievably rich and filling and I wanted to lick my bowl clean.  The little cafe also serves delicious gelato and my favorite thus far is the graham cracker gelato. Wow.  Get there early for HH because the patio fills up FAST."}
{"text":"Always a great place for brunch or lunch! Food is good, the service is always on point."}
{"text":"Still blown away every time I come here! My new favorite is the kale salad with added salmon. Seriously... Look at this picture. Have you ever seen anything more beautiful?!?"}
{"text":"Breakfast club sandwich on an English muffin?! So good!  Had a 2 hour layover here and decided to grab some breakfast. They have what's called the Breakfast club sandwich which consists of avocado, bacon, egg, and cheese all on an english muffin! WOW such a simple combination, but they made it taste so freaking good! http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Eszx9mddqS-rZd1AK6rGFw&userid=pmKnNkGVgzhMkwJaTU5apA The colors in my picture are so prettty!    The bacon was perfectly crisp and really pink too! It wasn't burnt and shriveled up like I've seen some places do it. This place is always packed because they offer breakfast foods as well as great lunch sandwiches! Everything here was so appealing to me I wanted to try it all! There is even an area where they have already made yogurt parfaits and tons of baked goodies to choose from.   I also decided to get a bag of chocolate chip cookies and those were so addicting I ate the whole bag by the time I landed in CA.....Felt like a fatty. Their cookies had white chocolate chips and regular chocolate chips. SO GOOD! The cookies are thin but just capture the sweet sugary flavors so well.   The workers are friendly too!  Olive & Ivy is also a restaurant in Arizona! Makes me want to take a trip there and just try out that restaurant!"}
{"text":"I like the fact, as opposed to Culinary Dropout, that every dude at Olive and Ivy does NOT have a beard! Good job guys Not over the top trendy And good old fashioneds too We went for happy hour and wanted to try all the specials"}
{"text":"It's always busy here. Been around a while and still does a good job. Food overall is good and the atmosphere is very pleasant. I've frequented everything from the dining to the small grocery style counter and enjoyed most of it. Today was pretty busy so we managed to squeeze a spot on the couch next to the bar. Service was a bit off and negatives included: eggs Benedict was way too soggy, brought our cappuccinos with no sugar or spoon and server vanished after taking the order.  But despite these issues I have to say I would try this place again because the food was previously pretty good. I've never thought anything was excellent or very memorable here but it is convenient and the patio areas are nice.  Still recommended."}
{"text":"I have patronized many of the Fox restaurants and so far this one is the worst. I found the prices to be quite high, although I guess it is expected for the area. The service was very good, but the food just mediocre. I tasted the artichoke appetizer which was no more than some canned artichokes on top of arugula dressed with balsamic and oil sprinkled with parm, nothing above average. For the entree I ordered the veal and spinach ravioli. The pasta was chewy, the filling was strange, it had what I think was raisins mixed into it and strangely no spinach. The sauce was very rich yet had little flavor. All I can say was I gave the place a try, I think once is enough."}
{"text":"A stylish and delicious option for lunch! We were lucky enough to be able to take advantage of their patio, complete with a little fountain, on a beautiful sunny day, and the yummy food and lovely service added up to a great experience. At first glance this place strikes me as a bit corporate, but at the end of it I felt that they really provided a unique experience.   Two highlights of the meal: the delicious pesto that comes out with their free foccacia bread, which must have a wheel of parmesan in each bowl, because it's so rich and wonderful. I also adored the asparagus, mushroom and white truffle oil flatbread, which I shared with the table and immediately wished I had gotten just for myself.   I also had the chopped chicken salad, which I found to be disappointing. First of all, there was WAY too much dressing on it, so everything felt drenched and a little wilted. Also, I was initially really curious about the granola that comes in it but I actually didn't feel that it added very much to the flavor and found myself picking around it.   I'd definitely suggest this place to anyone who wants some pretty classic salads, sandwiches and flatbreads with a little fancied-up twist!"}
{"text":"Great service and even greater food! They were very accommodating in regards to splitting plates between two people and having a high knowledge of the ingredients in their plates. I would definitely recommend this place to those who have never been before."}
{"text":"Disapointing after all the hype around this place. I had to return the frito misto (fried calamari, zucchinis and shrimp) as it was way too salty and had too much cheap batter. The staff was great and took it back and offered me to try something else on the menu, and did not charge me the plate. That is great customer service. The bacon wrapped dates were delicious and so was the seabass. But the sweet potato gnocchis were way too buttery. The menu is short and simple and as such I think they simply need to make a few adjustements for it to be better. However, I wont be going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary here last night and had an exceptional experience.  The location is wonderful-quiet and even though it was 105 degrees at 7:30 at night the combination of misters and waterfront location made for a very cool and enjoyable evening on the patio.  Speaking of which, the patio is ridiculously gorgeous.  Seriously, if they are trying for a European feel they nailed it.  Absolutely in love with the patio and the vibe.  The interior is gorgeous as well-just a bit on the loud side.  All depends on what mood you're in.    Our service was outstanding as well-from the time we were greeted, to the drinks at the bar and of course our table service all night was wonderful.  We felt spoiled.  And now on to the food..delicious.  The pesto and bread to start was amazing-some of the best pesto I've had (and it's one of my absolute favorite things).  We also had the fritto misto for an app which was very good.  Main dishes were the bacon wrapped pork and the sweet potato cannelloni-both full of flavor and quality.  We shared the lemon pudding cake for dessert, which was light and refreshing on a hot June night!    All in all, Olive and Ivy exceeded my expectations and we will without a doubt return.  Thank you for making our anniversary special."}
{"text":"The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous. Very nice outdoor seating. It is loud and very busy on weekend nights. I recommend making a reservation. Very nice date place  It is a little pricey. Most entrees about $20, but some around $15. Bread with pesto sauce is given to everyone. Their desserts are amazing!  Rated it down because the taste of the entree (flatbread) wasn't very good. And it is very slow service. Maybe slightly overpriced."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm a little partial because I helped open the coffee/gelato area way back when but after a few years hiatus, I'm glad to say Olive & Ivy is still spot on, if not, better.   My family & I came here for my birthday dinner & the hostesses were friendly and had no problem seating my mother & I even though the rest of the party wasn't with us (I know that some places are really finicky about that so it was nice to just be seated with no hassle).   Our waitress was great from the get go. Her name was Andrea I believe? She was very friendly without being too over the top & paid attention to details even going so far as to offer to have my niece & nephew's spoon & fork that they have with them whenever they go out rinsed off in the back (I know of places far less nice than Olive & Ivy who wouldn't even do that so it was major points).  We started off with the hummus with veggies that had a kick to it...pretty damn good. The bread with pesto is ah-mazing!! I probably (definitely) should have refrained from having as much as I did as I was stuffed by the time my meal arrived. After the hummus, I had the half portion of the beet salad with goat cheese and pistachios...pretty solid trio of ingredients on top of the arugula and it was yummy!  Following that, I ordered the flatbread; half Margherita half prosciutto/egg/potato and while I wasn't sure how that latter half would taste, it was good. I'm a sucker for prosciutto and theirs is no joke! I couldn't finish it (surprise surprise) but I still ordered desert...it's my birthday, what better day to treat yourself?! The ice cream bar that's been previously mentioned is SO good...coffee ice cream with marshmellow and a chocolate coating with some peanut butter thrown in for good measure.   I have to say, as well, that the cappuccino was amazing   Well done, O & I. I will definitely return sooner for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I never equate this as a place I think of when wanting to go out to eat.  Do not get me wrong, their menu is great BUT it is not anything like any of his other concepts ((Fox) in my opinion) since it seems a lil too simple and small....you can great an amazing meal (their scallops are awesome) here just for me it has been for the great patio, restaurant, bar ambiance for a few apps and drinks before heading out or somewhere for a quick drop in.  Great people watching and a great view of what the Waterfront architects were trying to create. Service is always just OK but this place always is busy so I guess that is to be sometimes expected."}
{"text":"Although our waitress was super nice, over all disappointing. We had a birthday celebration and had a few extra add ons including a few significant others in which we called well over 8 hours in advanced and apparently they could not even accolade one extra chair which was crap. Through out our meal there was multiple tables and extra chairs all around our party. Also I had a decent pizza and ate a slice packed up the rest to go and left it on the table- no one even had the curtesy to ring us or even let us know when we walked out and left an entire pizza on the table. Customer service below average with sub par food. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious red sangria, amazing food, and outstanding ambiance."}
{"text":"Gorgeous patio area.  We've been here once before and sat inside just for drinks.  But outside is where it's at!!  We started off we the lamb meatballs.  With the bread and pesto that was already part of the night, it was a great way to start.  We split the lasagna.  Both portions were reasonably sized and tasted great!  We tried the chocolate cake and lemon tres leches cakes.  The chocolate seemed a bit dry, and the lemon was very dominant in flavor.  I'd like to see more cocktails added to the drink menus."}
{"text":"I was visiting on business, and a  work colleague took me here (their favorite restaurant); it's located in an upscale outdoor retail and residence complex, Scottsdale Fashion Square, so on the plus side, they're situated in a good, vibrant location - suitable for people-watching!   It's a newer, larger-size restaurant, and kind of reminded me of something one might find here in the Bay Area - high ceilings, large open-air windows, well-dressed (yet casual) people, large bar, patio, animated conversations, etc. I liked the ambience - it wasn't too crowded, yet not deserted, either!  There was actually no wait, we were seated outdoors, and our server promptly took our drink order and also, served up some bread.  I opted for the Seared Ahi Tuna Salad - ($15) Mizuna Greens, Fresh Avocado, Mushrooms, Soy Caramel  ...extra avocado, of course!  The food was good, and my salad tasted really fresh - even the  tuna. I was not disappointed at all.   ...however, what I *was* disappointed in was the service. The food came out slowly, and after it was delivered, the server disappeared, and it was quite the effort for us to flag her down for drinks, etc. We were in a slight hurry, yet it was difficult to try to catch her for the bill.  After we finished eating, it was a good 20-minute wait before we took off. Had it not been for this point, I prob would've given this place four stars!"}
{"text":"We had a pre-Thanksgiving lunch with the family. Loved the new seasonal menu. The Kale Salad was delicious with the addition of Ahi Tuna - perfectly seered! Never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Simple and delicious. Yes, it's a little pricey and you can taste the difference in the food. I had the prosciutto and fig bruschetta to start. The thin sliced, salty prosciutto, slightly sweet pop of dog and peppery arugula combine for extraordinary flavor. When I ordered the kale salad for an appetizer my server suggested a 1/2 size - perfect!   The Chenin Blanc is a must try. The forward flavor is a bit sweeter than I normally like but the finish is a bit spicy. Lovely!  For dinner I ordered the natural chicken. Chicken thigh is on point. Potatoes are creamy as advertised. The mushrooms give the citrus jus an umami essence. It's maybe a touch sweet. Just a touch.   Sadly, I'm going to have to pass on dessert. Next time.   I know I sound picky but the large screen with football ruins the mood every time I look over. It's the only reason I've given the place 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"This place is consistently one of the best at PHX.  Very good hot sandwiches and fresh salads.   Prompt friendly service.   I will walk out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"I could spend all day here! Grizzly Claws are amazing! The patio is so relaxing! And their white wine sangria is delicious!"}
{"text":"Long-time friends invited us to dinner this past Saturday to Olive & Ivy. We've enjoyed meals there before and looked forward to dinner.  Service was certainly prompt and friendly... We ordered the Chef's Plate, Bacon-wrapped Dates, and one other appetizer to share. Tasted great, but the dishes came without serving forks or spoons. Fresh pesto and bread were excellent.  Bone-in Ribeye cooked medium was very good. Scallops...meh Sea Bass - very thin and dry due to being overlooked  Mediterranean Salad was ok...shrimp were way overcooked and rubbery  Nice atmosphere, not too crowded. Food was only 'ok'"}
{"text":"This place was meh. The place has way too much staff on the floor, makes it feel very busy and opposite of intimate. The menu during the weekend is limited to the brunch menu, which is disappointing, both with options and taste. Don't believe I'll be coming here again."}
{"text":"After discussing for a while different cuisines  and restaurants in Phoenix area, our niece's friend suggested olive&ivy for dinner. we made the reservation and found the restaurant after circling the shopping center couple of times (restaurant not visible from the street) we parked in the public parking and walked in the restaurant. As soon as we walked in we were awed, beautiful, spacey modern decor. we dined in the patio and it is beautiful there right by the canal, all the strings of lights felt like Christmas time. Ot was absolutely a delightful ambience.  Now unfortunately I have to comment about the food which needs much to be desired.  The appetizer, bruschetta, were ok, salad was pretty good but the main dishes were  disappointing.My spicy shrimp risotto was unflavorful, the risotto was like a paste and the shrimps had no taste. My niece ordered scallops and they had no taste either. same thing with the chicken dish my brother-in-law ordered and the sea bass my daughter had. We ordered lemon tres leches cake for dessert and unfortunately the have no idea what tres leches cake should taste like. it was too lemony and dry (it should be really moist with 3 kinds of milk). over all 5 stars for the decor and ambience, 2 star for the food, and 4 star for the waitress who was very knowledgeable and attentive and  patient. So it was mixed feeling but the sad thing is this restaurant has the potential to get 5 stars if they only improve their food quality. Oh, I forgot, my brother-in-law loved his entree (scotch with soda), no complaints from him."}
{"text":"Very gorgeous restaurant. The hummus and veggies we ordered before our meal was amazing and so was the bread and pesto provided. You can tell how fresh everything is. I ordered the chopped chicken salad and, while it was delicious, the blue cheese was completely overwhelming. There are so many delicious pieces to the salad that I was looking forward to- the peanut granola being one- and I could not taste any of them but the cheese! I will definitely try them out again though, a drink, appetizer and salad for around $30 was not bad. The coffee bar was amazing too. Got a little latte to go!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! Super friendly servers, great ambiance, I love the food and decor!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation inside on. Friday evening. I had a half Caesar salad and lasagna bologna see. My husband had chicken piccata. Both were good, but the lasagna was the better of the two. Our server (who was great!) recommended a lemon blueberry cake for dessert. It was light a delicious! As we left, we made a reservation for the following weekend on the patio. The vibe out there looks great!"}
{"text":"Airport food has always been kinda... meh.  Traveling home to Flagstaff on Christmas we had a 4 hour layover in PHX. We found that most of the restaurants we're closed but Olive and Ivy came through with some really good wood fired pizza that was made that much better by a young man working there named Casey.   He took a shift so a coworker could have Christmas off. Just a nice kid."}
{"text":"Great trendy ambiance and outstanding service.  We ordered bruschetta to start off and enjoyed it.  Nothing spectacular, but yummy nevertheless.  Ordered kale salad and loved it.  Ordered sea bass and it was good as well.  DJ in the house playing variety of music to  set the mood.  Will return and try something new."}
{"text":"One of my favorite patios in Old Town Scottsdale. It's inviting, comfortable and they offer great food as well."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my old town favorites  love their salads; entrées are very tasty  always have enjoyed their dinner time atmosphere  drinks are very good A bit on the pricey side but you get what you pay for Great service and food!"}
{"text":"Early morning travel rush and each person here greets you with a smile and looks you in the eye like you are a real person. I got the O&I it was delicious they put tomatoes on it! No one ever puts tomatoes on breakfast sandwiches...pretty freaking good.  As I'm enjoying this delicious sammy one of the staff walks by, looks like the manager and asks if I like everything and how was my service??? Holy Crap is this a hidden gem mom and pops bistro or an airport meal.  As I'm typing this email the manager is now walking around busing tables.  i would give the food a 4/5, the service a 10/5! Well done Olive & Ivy, well done."}
{"text":"Overall, this is a great date spot. My main attraction to this restaurant is the patio seating, especially this time of year.  The bruchetta is hit or miss.  I find the bread to be too crunchy sometimes where it hurts your gums to chew the bread, but the funghi has notably rich flavors. The prosciutto is average, and although the apple caponata was visually appealing, it was also average in taste.  The kale salad was refreshing and the serving size was large enough to split in two, but it could use more of the candied pecans. My favorite main dish so far is the veal and spinach ravioli.  I normally do not enjoy pasta, but the meat was flavorful and was complemented nicely with the light sauce.  The Seabass was poorly prepared.  Sea bass must be cooked properly, and this one was overcooked, giving it a dry texture throughout, but apparently that's the way the want it.  Next, they mask the flavor of the fish with a slice of bacon on top of the fish. I love bacon, but it does not belong on everything.  The sauce was also too tangy. Sea bass has a subtle natural flavor that should not be overwhelmed by a greasy chunk of pig.  Service was average for the FRC.  I'll be going back to olive and ivy for the ambiance, but I'll stick with the dishes that are easier for them to make."}
{"text":"The patio is the best! The environment is welcoming. And the service is nice. We wish the waiters/waitresses had to taste everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Just wonderful.  Food has yet to disappoint & service is impeccable.  Happy hour has great prices. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  If being trendy equated to a five star MEAL experience then this place would have been off the charts!!  I agree the bread and pesto were great, as was the bacon wrapped dates but a neighboring table ordered the fish, sea bass which I normally love, and it stunk so bad it turned my stomach.  I had ordered the prawns in risotto and was hoping they wouldn't smell, but alas, they did. I couldn't eat them so I tried my honey's lasagna but it was greasy. So....not real impressed. The decor was amazing, the music was bumping but I was there to eat and it didn't happen.  Yelp...you swung and missed. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Love this place! The atmosphere and service is top notch, and I've never had a bad meal here. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Mediterranean salad, sweet potato canoli and chocolate cake. Everything was good. The canoli was different but I tend to like savory. It felt like a desert. I tried the salmon and it was good as well. Salad was lightly dressed and it was good."}
{"text":"I have had several nice lunches at this restaurant but went there for dinner for the first time a couple of days ago.  The restaurant is large, and tends to be a bit noisy.  We were seated at a small table in the middle of the restaurant traffic even though the place was not busy. The noise made it hard to converse. Both the hostess and server seemed bored and indifferent.  The brushetta was very good.  The scallops were tasty, but the portion was very small for the price.  The chocolate cake was pretty bland.  Another time, I think I will just have appetizers and wine on the patio and go elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"I came to Olive & Ivy on Memorial Day and it was a wonderful experience! I was really feeling wine, so I started with a glass of the resiling. Don't get me wrong it was really good, but after trying my friend's sangria I could't help but wish I had gotten it! Safe to say, I will be getting it the next time I come in.... So yummy.   Please note: if you've never been to Olive & Ivy, the one thing you HAVE to ask for is the bread and their fresh made pesto. It will change your life - I swear! It pairs so wonderfully with all the other entrees and a glass of wine! For my entree, I ordered the veal ravioli. I will say... For the price, I was a little disappointed in the portion size. But it was so tasty it didn't matter much to me! It's smothered in this buttery sauce with parmesan. INSANELY good, people! Our server was also great in every way! Come to Olive & Ivy for any occasion!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with family and friends.  The back patio a Can be a quiet place to relax of have meetings during the week.  Keep the free pesto and bread coming."}
{"text":"12/2/10  2.5 stars.  Took my young cousin w/ me for happy hour and sat at the bar; This was her first time at O&I.  While I really like the look and the feel of the island layout of O&I's bar, I always feel like a fish out of water when I sit there.  (I've actually tried sitting there a few times when I've walked in solo, but always ended up moving to a table.  If it weren't for my cousin at my side, I probably would've moved to a table again, or, worse yet, walked out of the resto, which I've done before, too.)  Despite a few attempts at getting her to try a cocktail, she declined, and thus I proceeded to just order a glass of wine.  Why it's so hard to get a sampling of a couple of wines before settling on one to order here, I'll never know.  (Just a few nights ago, while at Beckett's Table, my server offered to have me try sips of the two wines I was having trouble choosing!)  Tsk, tsk, tsk!  We decided to try the Italian Sausage flatbread and the hummus app.  The flatbread, w/ its tasty and spicy Italian sausage chunks, consisted of a crispy crust w/ vibrant red piquillo peppers and creamy goat cheese-- I'd order this again, even though peppers and I don't exactly get along.  The hummus was equally delightful, w/ house-made pita bread and a \"petite Greek salad,\" which actually consisted of only sliced red grape tomatoes and chopped cucumbers (a no-no for me!) and a ton of feta on top.  Why the salad was piled ON TOP of the hummus, and not on the side, I don't know.  I suppose for the price of the app, I shouldn't expect more veggies used (a bit of lettuce, perhaps?), but it would've been nice to be able to pick the cukes out.  Served as it was, on top of the hummus, which looked like it was baked for a few minutes before getting the salad treatment, spooning the cukes off would've entailed major loss of delicious baked hummus goodness.  And we wouldn't have any of that!  I really wished we could've stayed past 6p to check out the celebrity guest bartender, but we had other appointments to keep.  My cousin really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere here, and I'd have given this review another 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that our bartender gave us such an attitude when I asked to sample the two wines first before ordering.    FYI, the happy hour menu changed, drastically reduced to only maybe 8 items or less, down from practically all of the apps and half of the flatbreads and a couple of salads that the old HH menu contained.  Recalling this, plus the wine and salad/hummus incidents, I may just have to say goodbye to O&I for a long, long time..."}
{"text":"Had to wait 10 minutes for them to warm up the soup. It was as still cold and what a nasty taste ! I bet it was frozen or canned soup ! Salad was ok"}
{"text":"Forgot to add a review when I went a few weeks ago.   A group of gals met here for a lunch meeting. The food was pretty good, I don't recall what I ate. Probably because I was distracted by the noise round me.  High noise level. They wouldn't let us have the back room because we couldn't guarantee that we'd spend their $250 minimum for the room.  We may go back as a group, but probably only if we can use their back room."}
{"text":"We love this place! Each time we visit, it's one place we are sure to have a great experience at! Another one of Fox concepts restaurant! Which to me means healthy and good! I first discovered their True Foods restaurant . Service is excellent and food is fabulous! Call for reservations. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy.  This was my 2nd time to have a meal at this establishment.  It had been years since my first trip, because I had dinner on my first visit and wasn't head over heels for the place.  On this occasion, friends of mine chose Olive & Ivy for a Sunday brunch.  The weather was beautiful in Scottsdale so there was a 30 minute wait to eat outside.  We were not in a waiting mood so we sat inside.  The ambiance of this restaurant is very cool and the service is good.  My frittata was eh.  It was not a meal I would rave about, which is why Olive & Ivy only gets 3 stars from me.  However, my friends really enjoyed their meals.  My friend Jess ordered the Margherita flatbread and commented that she would order it again without hesitation.  My friend Mollie enjoyed her Chicken Panini.  I almost gave Olive & Ivy 4 stars because it does have a fantastic brunch menu. Also, the pine nut pesto and bread that they bring to the table is scrumptious! I will return to Olive & Ivy again with a strategy.  I will order the vanilla buttermilk pancakes (saw them on another table and was super jealous!).  If I go for lunch, I will order a flatbread (because so many of those looked so fantastic).  I'm looking forward to my next trip!"}
{"text":"This place was excellent,  walk past culinary drop out and head over here. Everything was excellent. I had the chicken it was a sooo good. Great service. The corn chowder soup was excellent. You will enjoy sitting by the river walk.  Perfect evening."}
{"text":"Was here the past week for a private event, got to say, not very many establishments have the feel Olive&Ivy has. The ambiance is PRICELESS. What a great time of year to relax on the patio with a glass of wine and a flatbread! Dined with larger groups here as well, VERY accommodating staff. Great menu, great wine.   All and all, an awesome place. Will definitely be back soon for a date night!"}
{"text":"Great place to check out when in downtown Scottsdale. It can get loud at peak hours - so if your down for soft conversation forget it ...go off peak hours . I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. I've ordered the bruschetta (you can't go wrong with any of them) , the hummus ( all good) and the meat and cheese board . Drinks were great with a few unique twists .   This time we had artichoke hearts( delicious ) . The dressing made the dish . We had a Margherita flatbread that was great - the ends had some crust , like a pizza . The sea bass had a cauliflower purée that was caramelized and some grapefruit that was preserved, wow !  If your a fan of mushrooms you'll love the wild mushroom pappardelle . Pasta dish - cleaned the plate .   The sangria was also great - chose the white over the red , tasted a little sweeter with the berry taste - both were very good though .   It's a no brainer - we'll go back time and time again . Any of the Fox Concepts restaurants give an all class experience."}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy is my go-to place when I can't decide where to eat! I have never had a bad experience here. The sweet potato canneloni with shrimp is my FAVORITE!!!! Salmon plate as well as the scallops and potatoes are to die for. Try the red and the white house made sangria, it's nice, light and refreshing. Just what you need in Arizona! Nice staff, great environment. I also reserved a table for 12 for my birthday and they were very accommodating."}
{"text":"I have been to Olive & Ivy many times for happy hour and dinner, but my first time for brunch.  I went with some girlfriends and it was a perfect spring-time girls get-together.  I had the Cinnamon French Toast, which was amazing and my friends had the mixed berries with yogurt, also delish!   I was surprised at the portions (large) and the price (reasonable).  Would love to go back for brunch and try something new."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, the location is excellent and the atmosphere is excellent.  I want more of a reason to come back. Location, atmosphere, and decent food all positive, I'm just left wanting more, I can't put my finger on it.  The weather in Scottsdale is awesome and olive and ivy is on the water front, which is actually a concrete aqueduct."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times but last night really was a disappointment. The food, as always, is very good and always very flavorful and nicely presented. Our issue last night was with our server. She started out okay, a little slow to come check on us or to get our order. Never refilled our drinks or waters. We ordered appetizers and they were long gone by the time she ever came around to take our dinner order.   Once dinner was delivered we NEVER saw her again. We never had our waters refilled once, were never checked on to see if the food came out okay, nothing. We waited an hour before I had to flag down another server just so we could get our bill. The other server was quick to see we had been sitting there with dirty plates and empty glasses and were clearly irritated and she helped us quickly. It was pretty clear that our waitress had left for the night without telling us or any of the other staff to check in at our table.   What was planned to be a quick meal ended up lasting over 3 hours due to the extremely long time we spent waiting. I was just surprised that a restaurant of this caliber would have such poor service. It's unlikely we'll return."}
{"text":"Nice vibe! Lots of cool interior design. We sat at the bar and only order cocktails and appetizers because we couldn't get a table on the patio. So a tip is to call ahead and advance to get a reservation if you likes on the patio because it's absolutely not going to happen if you are walking in on a busy night. My bad! One really interesting appetizer was the trio of bruschetta and you were able to pick which ones you wanted. They were very good and a real fun appetizer to share with my husband. I highly recommend Oil & Ivy if you really want to get a feel for modern Scottsdale culinary landscape."}
{"text":"Although some of the items are a bit on the pricey side for takeaway food, Olive & Ivy does great coffee and pizzas.  $1.73 for a single banana?  They have it Fry's for .19 cents, so that's a huge markup.  Not too good for a budget traveler for sure. They do redeem themselves for having great breakfast items with prices comparable to other eateries in the airport.  Great Irish oats with apples! Their airport menu is not that extensive though but as a jet setter. I can honestly say that this is one of the best places to get your on-board meals before getting on the airplane. Service is friendly, and the line moves pretty quick!  AIRPORT: PHX  T4- A SIDE"}
{"text":"Visiting from Washington State.  I heard this place was good, so I took my mom to Olive and Ivy for lunch.  I ordered the turkey grinder and she ordered a salad.  The salad looked good, but I immediately distrusted the grinder they made for me.  The taste was all wrong.  It was very sour, like someone had dumped a ton of vinaigrette all over it.  The bread was way too hard, almost comically so, making it impossible for anyone to eat the damned thing without exerting a reasonable amount of effort.  After a few bites, I became astutely aware that my mouth was bleeding from the razor-like bread slicing into my gums.  I refused to eat anymore and sent my lunch back.  The manager graciously offered to pay for our lunch, due to the fact that their food had actually made me bleed.  Receiving a free lunch was nice, even though I left the establishment hungry and bleeding.  Although, I'm certain my mother enjoyed her experience, I certainly didn't.  I will not be returning to Olive and Ivy, due to the obvious lack of common sense exhibited by the people making the food, the people checking the food for abnormalities (like dangerously hard breads), and the management for their lack of oversight and ability to properly analyze their product.  Serving the right bread should be easy.  Unfortunately, Olive and Ivy made it look very difficult.  Any restaurant that fails so heavily on such mediocre and simple issues should be shunned and avoided."}
{"text":"Processed Cheese?!?  I went to Olive and Ivy with some friends for a birthday brunch - the waiter made it a point to say everything is made from scratch, homemade, the bakers got up at 4am to bake, etc.  Super - sounds great.  I ordered the Ivy Sausage sandwich, which is egg, sausage and cheese on a homemade english muffin.  One bite and I get that odd, familiar flavor of my childhood and realize they had put two slices of Kraft American Processed cheese slices on the sandwich.  What?? Are you telling me that Sam Fox can't have a hunk of cheddar cheese in the back for this?  It ruined an already mediocre sandwich that tasted like it came from a Jimmy Dean freezer box.  I scraped the cheese off the other half and tried to move on, but I'm still angry.  The two stars are for the good cup of cappuccino and the free dessert the waiter brought my friend, which was amazing.  Oh, and for using Open Table so we could make reservations and not have to wait.  None of my friends were terribly impressed with their meal either."}
{"text":"The vibe is super cool. Although trendy and somewhat posh, there's a cozy feel about the restaurant. I've enjoyed patio dining on a few occasions now and it's super cute. The patio is along the canal which gives a relaxed feel to things. Although a bit pricey, you are paying for the location and experience and I'd say it was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Have only been here twice, but if I lived in the neighborhood, would be dine here often!  Delicious, inventive food and pleasant staff.  Indoors is chic, but the patio is heaven!"}
{"text":"Came here for a desert date and to get a couple drinks, we got the sorbet (they make it fresh daily so ask what flavors they have, this time they had lemon and strawberry) YUM it was amazing, it was very refreshing and light ans not to overpowering. I had one of their sangrias and boy was it sure powerful, kinda on the pricy side but that's okay it was expected. The customer service wasn't great the hostess was pretty rude and had an attitude when asking us where we wanted to sit and our waiter was pretty foul too...look I know we aren't eating a full meal but a lot of people WONT jip you on a tip if you are helpful be a dbag  get a dbag tip..coming from someone who knows how the tip system works I won't be the one to dock you money for us nit ordering a full meal..get over it.   So do I recommend here:YES (didn't try regular food but desert won me over that I will go try it again.)  I hope that maybe they both were just having a bad day otherwise I hope you don't get the service we did."}
{"text":"I have been here 5 times and I have never been disappointed. The bread and pesto is to die for. I had the chicken salad this time.  Very nice and a large portion. My favorite is the bruschetta, sadly it wasn't on the weekend brunch/lunch menu so I will have to return on a weekday. The ambiance and location is very nice. Service is always great."}
{"text":"I have only been here for brunch on the weekend so my review is for brunch.  There is a great large area for the restaurant. It is a big open space with lots of seating. Not only that but there is also an outside space that has heaters too next to the water. The brunch is pretty good! The food has a Mediterranean and SoCal feel to it. Very tasty and not too much or too little. Not too shabby for a brunch! I'd recommend a try!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the ambience is A+. The service was below average, with the server only appearing once in a blue moon. Thumbs down. I'm honestly shocked the food got such great reviews. It's overpriced for subpar food. I asked for my steak to be cooked medium well (although I prefer my meat more on the medium rare side but I was splitting with my sister) and when it arrived, I could clearly see the bright red meat clearly in the dark, looking inedible. I went with friends and we only deemed one dish acceptable. Do not be fooled by these reviews. Only recommend coming with friends if you want drinks and a cute place for pictures. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Ive had like 5 birthdays here and their food is good as well as drinks. Good service and really nice atmosphere (inside outside patio) which is really romantic at night with their lights."}
{"text":"I always have the best experience at Olive & Ivy. All of the food is delicious but beware the menu is seasonal.. so if you really like something, just know it may not be there next time!  Other than that, I love it here. The service is always phenomenal and everyone is very professional and super nice. The last time I went to olive and ivy was for Mother's Day last year.. and guess where I'm taking my mom this year, yep olive & Ivy. :)"}
{"text":"Mason is amazing. Butternut squash items were amazing!  A must. Staff was very attentive to our larger group of ladies. Wait was a bit, but the restaurant was packed. Took a while for food to come out. But the staff kept coming by to tell us this, so no worries. We truly enjoyed all the different courses! Def going to be coming back!"}
{"text":"Nice place with a great patio area. I really liked the creativeness of the menu and the overall styling of the bistro.  The combination of the classic and contemporary is very evident at Olive and Ivy.  I would recommended this to anyone looking for an upscale setting but still wanting to be relaxed.  I like to enjoy a nice mojito out on the waterfront. Very nice in the hot Arizona heat. AHHHHH"}
{"text":"We reserved a private room for a bachelorette party dinner and it was AMAZING! The restaurant is beautiful, and being in the Stamp room was extra special.  The food was delicious and the service was first class. Lauren and Kevin took amazing care of our party! The room has a minimum and we were going to be short, so instead of just paying the difference, Lauren recommended a champagne toast for our guest of honor which allowed us to use our funds and made the night extra special! It was a dinner we won't soon forget. I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a special night out and we will be back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic place for a girl's night out! The food is delicious and the atmosphere is both lively and private. On weekends they have a DJ.  Their appetizer and small plates selections make for a perfect tapas experience. As far as entrees, the scallops with polenta are amazing. Check out the hummus and bacon wrap dates for appetizers. Looking forward to another fun night at Olive and Ivy!"}
{"text":"Alissa our server was beyond INCREDIBLE. We had a reservation for a group of 6 of us who were in town for a bachelorette dinner party. She was thorough, courteous, prompt, sweet, and provided such an special \"experience\" for all of us that we won't forget. We had a couple bottles of wine, and her bottle service was perfect. The bruschetta was to die for. She even delivered some shots for our table in honor of the bachelorette! She also delivered a second surprise... a dessert platter! We didn't have to ask for her to do anything \"special\" for our bachelorette... she automatically did it! That has never happened to me before at a restaurant.   She happily provided us some recommendations of places we should go to continue our evening, and I really can't say enough good things about her, the restaurant, and the service/experience that we were provided.  Thanks ALISSA!"}
{"text":"Came here for a business dinner and had a wonderful time! The service was perfect, very attentive but not annoying.  The bartenders we also great and the food was delicious.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated and cooler than the outside even when it is hot and the walls are open.  We will come back for personal when we are in town next time."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful and the small plates quite well done, but how can the offer a lasagne Bolognese that is closer to chili with a few pieces do pasta arranged in a bowl? And since when is cannelloni a rectangular ravioli? And although the waitress was attentive, our water glasses were never refilled! Too bad because we had high hopes after we read most reviews."}
{"text":"3.5 On the pricey side (then again it is the airport) but the Mediterranean salad was fresh, and it did taste good."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance. The first time I dined here, I had ordered several plates (bruschetta, flatbreads, which were all pretty good). This time we had come for a late night dinner and wanted something light. The hummus was delicious and one of the best ones I had in Arizona. The San Tan porter and Sedona hefe were refreshing. Hummus was delicious. San tan porter and Sedona hefe were refreshing. Great place for a date or  to catch up with friends while munching on good food."}
{"text":"Is it a get your drink on and flirt your a$$ off, because you look damn good tonight or is it a fine dining establishment...?  Well, it is definitely the former but fine dining, mmmm, not so much.   On the bar, seen and be seen crowd, it is awesome. Dress to the nines because it feels like Vegas ladies. People look fabulous and you can people watch all night and not be bored. The drinks are stiff, damn expensive and well worth it.   The food...Denny's sous chef was cooking the night I was eating and was doing a less than slamfastic job. We had the calamari and it was deep fried and resembled calamari in shape only. I had the bacon wrapped pork and was extremely unimpressed. The bacon was thin and slim. The sauce was dark, syrupy and had no particular taste. The ceasar salad was pure Denny's. Cut pieces of iceberg lettuce with a mayo dressing and big croutons.  Strangly, marscapone cheese was  a common ingredient in many dishes, the sauces and the soup. Given marscapone's bland taste, I didn't find adding it to entrees that innovative or interesting. So, get dressed up, get your drink on, but given the location, the Scottsdale restaurant scene is your oyster, so dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy serves up refreshing salads and sandwiches, perfect for a lunchtime meal.  Portions are big, and you will leave satisfied and very full.  Service here is cheerful and attentive.  I would definitely like to go again to try their weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"This is place has an incredible patio view in downtown Scottsdale. The food was delicious and the view from the patio is awesome. It's one of the busiest places in the area, so there's something to be said about that. We saw lots of people waiting to be seated so a reservation is merited."}
{"text":"Worst experience I have had. Their manager had no concept of how to work with customers. There was a misunderstanding about our reservation time and all he would say is \"read the contract\" . He had no authority to address the issue. We will never go to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"You walk in to impressive decor and a friendly hostess. Server was also friendly and helpful.   My appetizer was tasty and arrived quickly. .    The Caesar salad was too cheesy for my taste and the lasagna was more sauce than noodles.   I did like the cherry sorbet..."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and came out quickly. I had the Mediterranean salad w/ grilled chicken. The drinks were delicious. Its a big open space with a huge bar and a cool vibe. Our server was friendly but we had to ask him SEVERAL times for things like ketchup, hot sauce, water, etc. because he kept forgetting to bring it over to us. Other than that we had a great time! I would definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"This place was simply amazing! The food, drinks and service were delightful!   I had the smoked salmon bagel and it's legit one of the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"A wonderful, fairly new restaurant addition to the newly added local food spots at the airport terminal 4.   They offer delicious breakfast sandwiches and homemade flavorful muffins. During lunch a fresh variety of deli sandwiches are served on ciabatta bread. The homemade Sicilian style pizza is a must.   The seating area is comfortable and modern."}
{"text":"I have only ever eaten the breakfast (egg and avocado sandwich) and pastries (cupcakes and bear claws) here, and both are very good!! The staff is very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go-to spots! It never gets old. Food recommendation: the bouillabaisse. So good!   Bottom line- the food is delicious and you honestly can't beat the fun, chic atmosphere. They have a gorgeous outdoor patio for lounging with a drink plus plenty of bar space and indoor and outdoor seating.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I like the scene of the restaurant and the food was decent. The service was commendable and very friendly. The only disappointment was that for the price of the food I was just hoping for better. I would come here again but it just wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"I had never been to Olive and Ivy, I chose to take my mother there for Mother's Day. We usually try to avoid eating out on a holiday, but this special menu looked good on line, and we thought \"what the heck\".  Boy, are we glad we did!!  Service was superb! We had Mark Anthony as our waiter - yes, that is his name! In fact, he was so good that I said he must be a trainer - yes, he is!!  Food was EXCELLENT!! I'm making a reservation for Friday evening. I look forward to experiencing it non-holiday!  The only issue was the table situation. They sat us at a table for two that - no kidding, was in the middle of the walk way! We moved it a bit over and it made it a little better.  One of the hostesses came over and asked if we wouldn't mind moving over so they could fit a 4-top next to us - yes, we would mind moving over - we just moved from there because we were in the middle of the walk area - what did they do? They moved the 4-top around us to where they wanted us to move to and what do you suppose happened?  The table of 3 (very gracious ladies because they didn't say anything) were forced to sit in the middle of the walkway and were literally in the way of the waiters and busboys trying to get around them!! One woman was scrunched over by me to try to get out of the way! They are better people than I for not saying something!  Mr. Fox runs his restaurants like a well oiled machine, it would surprise me if he knew they were trying to fit in tables where they don't belong - especially since it truly hinders the guest experience! I'm not dinging them a star though, I chalk it up to a holiday.  Everyone knows not to eat out on a holiday!!  When we go this Friday and those tables are no where to be found, that will confirm my hunch!  I hope Mark Anthony is working on Friday night!!"}
{"text":"The short rib sandwich was uber delicious, as was the bread, salmon flatbread, and the coffee! We all know how much I love coffee, and I loved it, including the glass.  I also love how they flavor their water every day in a different way.  Another thumbs up for Fox Restaurant Concepts!"}
{"text":"When for brunch... Solid food, good service, and the interior is beautiful.  There is a grab-and-go market with sandwiches and pastries.  Good wine, beer and drink menu.  You pay a little extra for being at Scottsdale Fashion Square."}
{"text":"Have been to Olive and Ivy in Scottsdale twice now; both times when visiting my daughter who lives here.  It is in a great location, near the Fashion  Square mall and old-town Scottsdale, and right on the river, where you can sit outside.  Incredibly comfortable seating outside, and it is pretty well shaded, so you are out of the Arizona sun mostly.   This time was for lunch, and the three of us enjoyed a chopped salad, a mediterranean salad, and a chicken grinder.  There were no complaints. The service was fast, friendly and professional.  It is a good be if you are in that neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We were given a gift card for Olive & Ivy. We were thrilled to go back for a second visit.  We got Bouillabaisse which, she is still raving about and overjoyed that she has some left over for tomorrow. (That is not over exaggerated at all!)  We also got the Bacon wrapped tenderloin, which was nothing short of perfect! Juicy and tender and wonderful flavor!  The desserts were just as good as the entrées. The Caramelized cake is dangerous! Stuffed, and yet we could not put down our spoons and let any of this go without being eaten!  To top it off the ambiance is open and welcoming. There is plenty of outdoor seating if you want to enjoy the Arizona weather. And better yet, Mason, our waiter, was very attentive and helpful! We were very impressed by him.  Olive & Ivy will definitely be a go-to eatery for us! We highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We came for dinner just before 6 on a Thursday. I had noticed they had happy hour until 6, but the hostess informed us this was only at the bar. We could have saved a few $$ if we had just done that, but honestly the food was so good I didn't feel bad paying more.   Bread was brought to our table and served with a pesto dipping sauce - I ate the remainder of the sauce with my hands it was so good.  We ordered the Mediterranean salad and piccante flatbread. I also ordered a red sangria - which was different from normal sangria since it had crushed berries it it - but it was one of the best sangrias I've ever had. The salad and flatbread were delicious. The salad was big and worth the price - flatbread was good but maybe a better deal on the happy hour menu since it was smaller than expected.   The food was the perfect portion so we still had room for dessert. We decided on the coconut cakes with blood orange sorbet. This is probably gross but I honestly did not want to swallow my cake - I kept it in my mouth like a fine red wine and savored every last piece.   This restaurant needs to come to Chicago - I would be all over it like white on rice."}
{"text":"Excellent service from our waiter Kalei!!  Atmosphere was good but the music was a bit too loud out in the patio for conversation.  Brussel sprout bruschetta was exceptionally delicious.  Sea Bass was a tad overcooked but the caramelized cauliflower accompaniment was tender and tasty.  The lemon flavored dessert was a little tangy and the cake just melts in your mouth.  The coconut cake served with blood orange sorbet was average, couldn't taste any orange in the sorbet.  Definitely request to sit in Kalei's section again."}
{"text":"I really, really enjoy this place. I think they have such a cool atmosphere going on and their food is just to die for.   We always make a reservation when we come and the service is always wonderful.   I usually get the Filet that comes in a horseradish sauce that is amazing! Not what you would think, and not spicy. Just flavorful and savory. My mouth waters just thinking about it!  The wine list and desert list are also great. Great place for date night or just to grab dinner with friends.   They also sell gift cards at Costco that are $100 in food for only $70! Great deals and great food. One of the best!"}
{"text":"The decor is fantastic, great location, and the food is good! The wait was 1.45 hours but we got a table by the bar within 5 min. I got the Tuna salad sandwich w/bacon (great) because this is American and it was the right thing to do."}
{"text":"One of many in a line of interesting restaurants by this restaurant group. The decor is really impressive, great for dates or social groups. Everyone in my party loved the lighting, staff, and service.   The menu is hit or miss, we had quite a few misses in the appetizers / starters. A lot of things lacked seasoning, other things were just unoriginal.   The meal was going downhill until we hit our entrees which were absolute home runs. The pasta was amazing, executed really well, delicate but flavorful. For desert the outstanding dish was the homemade ice cream bar, the salt was a great touch, it was original and a perfect closer.   I'd recommend this place if you have money to spend figuring out whats good for yourself otherwise I'd stick to some of the recommendations made on yelp without a thought of straying."}
{"text":"This place was a surprise.  We were at the mall nearby and saw the reviews.  Will keep this review short.  Waiter wasn't that great, the person who was shadowing him was actually much better and friendlier.  He also poured our alcoholic beverages at brunch (only one per person) as a much lower level then any table around us, by about half.    Food, pretty decent.  One person ordered the Margherita pizza.  good crust, right about of tomato, the mozz did NOT taste fresh whatsoever, but the weird thing, my sister asked for some Ricotta cheese to be added, and it made the dish!  Another person ordered the egg sandwich which was just okay, when it's mostly bun/roll versus inside, it's never a good thing.  And lastly I had the grilled chicken panini.  There was not a lot of chicken on this at all, but the aioli made up for the sandwich as a whole.  Is it worth going, yeah.  The atmosphere is awesome, place is stunning, food, average."}
{"text":"Took my parents here for our traditional weekly dinner and it was lovely! I thought I had made reservations through the automated system but my age must be showing because they didn't have us on the list and thus no outside seating and wow, they have some lovely outside seating among these great heavily leafed trees but still, seated in less than 15 minutes.  Instead of full meals we shared a series of appetizers. I wasn't crazy ab out the Bruschetta but the lamb meatballs were good. My parents also enjoyed the hummus and I guess my overall favorite was the fresh sliced bread with the pesto sauce amazing. I did have a cocktail, the Cactus Blossom and the server did warn me it was on the sweet side but honestly, taste reminded me somewhat of cough syrup so I won't order that one again. However, you get your money's worth as I definitely felt the cocktail when it was done.  I guess I thought the food was good but what I especially liked was that the place had that operational hum of excellence which I've come to expect from the Fox Restaurants Concepts group. They know how to run eating establishments with a high end focus  and it shows. I look forward to coming back here again, though I have to try that outside seating when the weather is nice, looks wonderful. :-)"}
{"text":"Always great food, small portions and pricey. I try not to babble on and such, but yelp does not like short reviews."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for my 30th birthday! YAH! I was not disappointed! I thought the decor here was out of this world and it takes so much talent to design like this....As some of you are food snobs I am a food and ambiance snob. We had the pita chips and hummus to start which was so good. A great feature added to the hummus was cucumbers which added a nice crunch. I also enjoyed tomato bisque soup which was out of this world. I think the waiter we had was nice but did not seem to have much of a personality which I do look for in my dining experience. I would go back here but not too soon as I have a whole list of places I would like to try now that I just moved here!"}
{"text":"This place is good but the plates were small. The food was good but a little pricey.  But it is Scottsdale so that is to be expected."}
{"text":"Very nice restraunt, the menu is very complicated and I don't know what have of the foods even are! I just simply order bruschetta or kids pasta due to the face that I don't know anything else on the menu, and everything is quite pricey."}
{"text":"Came here for Happy Hour on a Wednesday and grabbed a seat in the lounge. This place has a really nice ambience with great lighting and friendly staff. Had the Mediterranean salad with shrimp (not on happy hour) and shared 3 of the bruschettas- avocado, salmon, and prosciutto (3 for $10 on HH). Also had a glass of Pinot Noir ($5 on HH). Everything was really delicious and not too heavy- will definitely be back to try some of their other menu options. The mall also offers plenty of free and easy parking."}
{"text":"This place has a fun and welcoming atmosphere. The food is good too. I had a fish dish that was fresh and tasty.  I've been here a few times, so it must be pretty good. I love the outside seating as well as the bar area. There is always activity around."}
{"text":"We came here for a casual Sunday brunch and really loved the ambiance of the outdoor patio area. While service was a a bit slow, the food was delicious! There is an amazing coffee and gelato bar that your can carry out but I really loved the lattes and baked goods. Plenty of vegetarian options and a great place for big groups. The complimentary bread and fresh pesto was delicious and definitely made our salads a bit yummier!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I spend my fair share of time down concourse A of Sky Harbor's Terminal 4. Fortunately this Olive & Ivy location opens early, closes late, has good food, and seems to hire friendly, kind, caring people. I've been here multiple times and have never had a negative experience. Now folks will complain about the prices but it's an airport restaurant so you must have reasonable expectations. Average panini will run you ten bucks and a side is a couple of bucks."}
{"text":"I really love this place. We had our company christmas dinner there, and numerous dinners among friends. Each time the food was good and service was prompt."}
{"text":"O&I is the bees knees - face down (ass up) one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale/Phoenix, for sure!  My significant lover and I stumbled upon this place by accident, we were actually trying to find Culinary Dropout but my (retarded) GPS led us astray but lo and behold - Olive & Ivy stared at us...and we stared right back into its glorious face.  It's a huge restaurant and has a very upscale/classy vibe, but still maintains a romantically casual mood.  There's plenty of outdoor seating but what really takes the cake is the private dining in the back, which you typically need to reserve in advance unless you're lucky.  Service is always friendly and spot on but, of course, what really shines is the food.  Allow me to plan out your entire meal for you (you're welcome):  1. Start with the trifecta order of bruschetta and pick: prosciutto & fig, manchego, and fresh mozzarella.  You have not truly enjoyed bruschetta until you eat the aforementioned ones.  2. Prosciutto & mascarpone tortelli for sure.  3. Chicken scallopini - so tender, so juicy, so flavorful, AND it has prosciutto and mozzarella.  What more could you ask for?  4. If you're feeling baller I say it's justified to spend $38 on the Filet of beef.  You will not regret your choice...unless you accidentally forget and order the bone-in ribeye instead (I warned you).  5. I'm not big on getting dessert here since Gelato Spot is just down the street, but if you're up for it - try the peanut butter pudding.  Bonus Tip: Go to Costco (or visit the website) and pick up the Fox Restaurant Concepts gifit cards.  You can buy two $50 giftcards for only $79.99, so that's 20% savings right there.  And there you have it.  Get your gift cards from Costco, make your reservation on opentable, book the private dining area, experience heavenly flavors, and get ready to fall in love with Olive & Ivy."}
{"text":"Gorgeous outdoor patio. Tasty sangria. Server indicated all food made fresh on the daily (including pasta, flat bread crusts, pesto, etc) .... Heavenly :)"}
{"text":"The pasta has great taste and is prepared fantastically. The only down side is the portion side. They served very small portions for an entree. The environment and atmosphere is fantastic and sheik, I loved it."}
{"text":"My friend told me that this would be the perfect first date spot and he was correct! The atmosphere was amazing and the weather was great so requested to sit on the patio. Our server was very knowledgable about all the menu items as well as the wine list.  Will definitely be coming back here soon!"}
{"text":"This is my wife and my favorite date night location. The filet is reasonably priced and amazingly seasoned. I always get one of the fish dishes and wow. He bruschetta is also to die for. Definitely get a reservation as this place can get quite busy but it's worth planning ahead. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner and drinks at the bar last night... the female bartender never smiled once... she looked pissed every time we asked for another drink or a water refill.  Never asked if we needed anything, how was our meal etc.  Back in 2007 - 2010... they had truly professional bartenders.  They knew your name, they'd anticipate your needs etc.  They've moved down market with the current staff... last nights bartender belongs at Zipps."}
{"text":"Bruschetta and drinks are good. Food is definitely mediocre. I would only go here for happy hour. Not worth full price. Service ok."}
{"text":"High prices, salad is bitter. Service is just okay. Changing my star from 2 to 1. The waitress places the silverware directly on the table.  Very unsanitary!"}
{"text":"I hosted a large work event on the patio with heavy appetizers and drinks for about 40 people. Our main server, Daniel, as an absolute ROCK STAR - he took care of our whole group swiftly with a smile. Daniel has the ability to take drink and food orders for about 20 people at a time, all in his head, without missing a thing. I cannot say enough good about Daniel - ask for him, he will take care of you.  Otherwise, the food was really good - bacon wrapped dates, flatbreads, ravioli served family style, beet salad and hummus. They also have interesting cocktails, sangria and a great wine/beer selection.   We will be back for future events - thank you!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here this evening with some family from out of town. Stellar. Split the Fresh Mozzarella, Fig & Prosciutto and Manchego Bruschetta. All wonderful. The guys both ordered the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin, sister-in-law ordered the scallops and I ordered the spicy shrimp risotto. I had a bite of each and believe me when I say you can't go wrong with any of those entrees! Our server was friendly and made lots of recommendations and my boyfriend and sister-in-law both agreed the bartender made a mean Dirty Martini:) Overall a solid experience. Atmosphere feels upscale while still being casual, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I visited Olive and Ivy last night with a few of my friends and I have to say that the service we received from Thomas Mann was outstanding! !!  He was attentive to our table while having to serve several other tables.  The food was excellent.   The portions were just right Just as a suggestion when serving the lamb meatballs,  is it possible to have mint jelly as a compliment to this tasty dish? I will be back in the near future.  I thought the restaurant was absolutely beautiful with the lights all around."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a quick breakfast on my way home, while I was at the Phoenix International Airport. It was a good choice. The breakfast sandwich I had was hot, fresh and quick to go. The cinnamon bun I indulged in was a good-bad life decision (good because it was tasty and fresh, bad because, well, it's a big ol' cinnamon bun that I really didn't need, but impulse bought). If on the off chance I'm in the region again, I would stop in here for a bite again."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in my experience at Olive & Ivy. I went for a dinner with a few friends who, like me, had flew in from out of state and made reservations to dine. The service was absolutely horrifying. We were seated by a hostess who didn't do so much as to smile or make eye contact once with our group. She was cold and uninviting which was surprising considering there wasn't a crowd or any reason for her to be so distant. When we were seated, it took about ten minutes before we were given a menu. I had a Caesar salad which was unfortunately so horrible I had trouble getting beyond a few forks. The bruschetta's were okay at best.  The only appeal this restaurant provided was aesthetic. It is beautiful. If you are looking for a great dinner, drive past Olive & Ivy. However, if you're after a gorgeous dining decor, this is your place to go."}
{"text":"I LOVED the service!  We had a car issue and had to push our reservations 30 minutes.  Even though they were completely booked because of Mothers Day and Prom...they were willing to work with us.  I told them we would leave when the next reservation for our table arrived.  They were awesome...attentive, quick, efficient and so professional without being pushy.  The manager even sent us over a free appetizer to help ease our earlier evening stresses I guess...how nice is that!   No only was the service amazing...but the food was EXCELLENT!!  This is when spending the money is worth it!  The white sangria was wonderful, the bacon wrapped dates were amazing and the butter salad and chicken with prosciutto were worth every bite!    Would highly recommend this particular area for out-of-town guests.  We walked over the bridge and enjoyed looking over the water and the beautiful grounds.  Very trendy area with at least a dozen restaurants/lounges/patios to hang out in.  Or, take an extended golf cart to old town Scottsdale to listen to some country music."}
{"text":"Went here with some out-of-town friends on Sat night.  Their pick - so glad they made this choice.    Excellent service with a top notch, well informed waiter.  Between 4 of us, we ordered a variety of items including the hummus appetizer (just spicy enough), sweet potato cannelloni, veal & spinach ravioli, some new tortellini dish and a rib eye steak dinner.  I tried bites of everything and all I can say is WOW!  It was all I could do the stop myself from jumping into the dish and rolling around in the sauce.  Very fresh and sauces were light, not the heavy pasta thing you might expect.    The only minor criticism is the house salad.  People, it's just a bowl of lettuce - NO enhancements, not even a lone crouton.  The vinaigrette dressing helped make up for the lack in the bowl but I think they really need to consider perking up the lonely lettuce.  It's kind of a loud atmosphere indoors.  We were seated in a cozy booth that faced the patio so some of the noise was blocked.  They had some kind of dj-something playing music and a few people dancing (??) behind us.  Still it was quiet enough for conversation at our booth.  The patio looked very inviting, that could be a good location for next time (yes, there will be a next time).  I highly recommend reservations here.  Fortunately we did have them and were seated right away.  Just in front of us were 4 people who were walk-ins and were apparently told it was a 3 hour wait??  Needless to say, they were walk outs after that news.    Anyway, I'm a new fan here.  Looking forward to more culinary experiences with Olive & Ivy."}
{"text":"My mothers birthday is on NYE so I wantged to treat her to a nice meal with nice ambience early in the evening before things got crazy. I unfortunately waited until just days prior to NYE to request a reservation and Olive & Ivy was already full so I had them put me on a wait list. Id never been to O&I but the Waterfront view is what I was looking for and the NYE Menu sounded amazing, I was elated that they called me early afternoon NYE to tell me they could make our reservation.  Our waiter Stew was polite, attentive, efficient. The complimentary pesto dipping sauce was delish and I would have been content eating just that. I ordered scallops, which were good. I havent had scallops that I liked that much in a long time. I also got a small portion steak with the scallops. My mother ordered salmon which she was enjoyed. After I told Stew it was my mothers birthday he brought her a slice of chocolate cake and candle on him which made my mother feel special.  I was very happy that we were able to get our reservation and it will be my first choice for lunch or dinner when Im in the area again"}
{"text":"We had a girls dinner here for a special occasion. Love the ambiance of this place and the open air with indoor/outdoor seating. House-made pasta and bread, yum! Our server Mark Anthony was amazing."}
{"text":"NOTE: This is a review of Olive and Ivy during the day, not at night when the douche bags of Scottsdale invade!  The atmosphere is impressive--the patio is relaxing (I just have to laugh every time I think of the \"waterfront\" scam that Scottsdale is using to fool property owners--it is a big ditch!!)  Anyway, I love the variety of their weekend brunch, unique egg dishes, yogurt, and  cinnamon french toast.  They also have pastries, juices and even gelato!    I love taking a break from shopping for O&I brunch on the weekends, but I would be fine to never go there again after dark.  It is a classic Scottsdale experience in which the women are competing for most makeup and least clothes and the men are all wearing the same rhinestone Ed Hardy or 7 Diamonds shirt and way too much of whatever cologne is the 2008 equivalent of Drakkar Noir.  Anyway, the brunch is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times for lunch and it's great - 'an old reliable'.  The pesto and fresh bread is delicious.. I nearly always have the Salmon for my lunch....always excellent. This place gets really busy, but it's always good."}
{"text":"For the airport in Phoenix:  Good food. Fast and reasonably priced.   Loved the snickerdoodle cookies."}
{"text":"We recently had a very short layover in Phoenix and decided to stop by Olive & Ivy for a quick dinner. We were really impressed with the quality and freshness of the food but we were even more impressed with their customer service! The staff was super friendly and even offered to clear our togo containers when we were finished with our meals.   Even beyond the restaurant setting their staff went above and beyond. As soon as we boarded our flight my husband realized he was missing his wallet. We knew he couldn't get off the plane but he wanted to go talk to the flight attendant about what he could do to try and get it back. Before he could even make it up to the front of the plane the flight attendant was heading down the isle with his wallet in hand. Someone from the restaurant had found it, gone to AA to find out what flight we were on, what seat we were in, and had it delivered safely to us.   We are so incredibly thankful and will make sure to stop by Olive & Ivy every time we pass through Phoenix from now on! Thank you so much for such good food and service!"}
{"text":"I was at Scottsdale, Arizona for a week long work conference when I stumbled upon this restaurant as one my hotel's \"food recommendations\" I love Mediterranean food so I decided why not! Since I was alone, I didn't wait too long to be seated and sat in front of the servers/chefs bar. I did feel a little uncomfortable because I came alone (definitely a place to go with significant others or a group of people) but gladly enjoyed the opportunity to watch the servers/chefs work. My waitress was really nice too (unfortunately forgot the name) and kept me company when she had downtime.   I ordered the shrimp scampi risotto, the Mediterranean salad, and a glass of white wine. I absolutely loved every single part of my meal. The Mediterranean salad was a great palette cleanser (huge portions) and the shrimp risotto was perfectly cooked. -1 star because it was a little too salty that I needed lemon to wash it down. I was still impressed because the risotto consistency was great and in my opinion hard to perfect. The complimentary bread was pretty tasty too!   I absolutely adored the romantic ambiance.. wish my boyfriend was able to join me :("}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy has been a business lunch place of choice on three occasions. I originally had an amazing salad, which continues to produce a drooling pair of lips. Can a salad merit 5-stars? Yes. Yes, because I do not enjoy salads 99/100 times. Unfortunately, I don't see it on their menu and I've only been back once since I first ordered it here. If I return, it's the chopped chicken salad (+corn) for me!  They also have delicious mac'n'cheese, pizza, and WINE! Who doesn't enjoy a personal-sized carafe of wine during lunch? There's nothing like jumping into the office with a few of your worries thrown down the hatch like a chilled white in the early afternoon!"}
{"text":"If you want to get your 'swank' on, this place is for you.  It's a fun spot to meet friends for a drink and appetizers.  I love the tapas plate which has olives, fruit, cheese, pita bread, etc.  It's delicious and well priced."}
{"text":"Moderate pricing and gourmet type comfort food. This is one of the places we like to take our guests because the have one of the best patios in Scottsdale. A staple alongside the water district, the setting is comfortable and welcoming. Sit on the patio if the weather is right but the indoors is good too. Recommend!"}
{"text":"My mom and I came here for a nice little ladies night out and it was very enjoyable. We sat on the patio which was beautiful! It was hot outside, but there were misters and the trees provided great shade and added a bit of coolness. The pesto and focaccia was delicious. We tried the bruschetta trio...the goat cheese and asparagus, manchego and another one. All were good. The funghi flatbread was good, and the beet salad was great! Overall the atmosphere was very nice."}
{"text":"I've been to a handful of the FRC restaurants out in the real world and they seem to have taken over this portion of the terminal. Had the breakfast sandwich which was solid and an iced coffee which was meh.   Definitely a good food option in the airport. 4 (airport) stars."}
{"text":"We loved this place. Came in with a big group of 13 for a nice dinner.  Great food, appetizers main courses and desserts good wine list.  Love the decor and location, and the staff is hot.    Easy walk to bars from dinner.  Check it out."}
{"text":"If you're in Scottsdale with a big group you should book a table at Olive & Ivy. We were in town for a bachelorette weekend and came for dinner on Saturday night. It was my favorite part of the weekend! The atmosphere is fun and upbeat and the restaurant itself is beautiful! We had a reservation and were seated in a corner of the patio immediately on arrival.  The servers were attentive but not overbearing. They gave us free lemon drop shots for the group at the end of our meal in honor of the bachelorette!  The food and drinks were good - we tried every bruschetta for the table! My favorites were the prosciutto, manchego, and avocado! I got the shrimp risotto for my meal and it was delicious but a little heavy. My strawberry and thyme cocktail was very refreshing without being too sweet.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Poor service =no service tonight. Waited over 15 minutes, waiters, busboys, people with pitchers of water walked past us several times and not one person spoke to us.  Told manager and he offered us a free meal and coupons to other restaurants. We declined. He continued to follow us out side.  Had to tell him several times NO.    Guess they did not like that we were dressed for bike riding, even the hostess turned her nose up at us  Hey management- bike riders are local!   Can you afford such bad word of mouth from us?"}
{"text":"This place is super cool and hip. I love the patio and the food and service was good."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite at the Scottsdale \"Waterfront,\" and I loved that they could accommodate our big party on short notice right before the major Stanford pep rally across the street.   We had fantastic service, I loved the proprietary wine selection (the pinot noir was especially good), and the food was delicious.  My only complaint is that the portions were just way too small for the prices being charged. Salads were nice and big, but the $25 fish entree was maybe 4 oz of fish, and the scallops only came with 3 smallish scallops on the plate. Definitely not enough of a meal for any of our men! We wound up needing to stop for fast food after the pep rally because they were all starving again an hour and a half later."}
{"text":"I am giving Olive & Ivy only 1 star because the employees have no idea how to run a restaurant or deal with customers.  We went there to celebrate a Birthday which did not go too well.  First when we made the reservation we were told to come in before 3pm on a Sunday so we could order from 3 menus well when we arrived, we were told a different story about the menus and told something else by another person and the story kept changing depending on who you spoke with.  Well this restaurant should be closed between 3-5pm on weekends as the only items are flatbreads, a select few salads and apps but no one tells you this when you call.  So we had planned to order dinner but were told we could not something to do with the kitchen, but we were also told we could not order from the brunch or lunch menu either so we were stuck as to what to order, well it was terrible - the flat breads were terrible, dry and way to salty. The bacon burger was not worth $12.00 and it was just a real bad time and the manager would not comp anything for all the bad information and did not seem to care we could not find anything good to eat on the menu.  We had told the waitress we could not handle anything spicy as to let us know if we ordered something which was spicy well do not order the hummus, we were not told it had jalapenos in it even though we asked, they did not take it off the bill even though 5 of the 6 people at the table did not eat it.  We will not visit again, very bad experience, bad manager, bad customer service.  not a good fox restaurant, plus the uniforms looked like construction workers.  The food, was well not worth the money and have had much better elsewhere."}
{"text":"We came here for my bachelorette party dinner.  We had a reservation for 6 and were seated right away.  We ordered some appetizers, like the variety of brushetta.  They were all very good.  For my meal I had a small cesar salad and a flatbread.  The flatbread was ok but the salad was very good.  We all had drinks.  The service was great and the food was awesome.  They even brought me a special dessert since it was for my bachelorette party."}
{"text":"Unbelievable ahi. Service was adequate.  Mood and ambiance was good. Background music was nice. Will go again sometime."}
{"text":"We went to Olive & Ivy for our third time a couple weeks ago with friends.  Each experience has been different, and I must say that this place needs to make up its mind.  Is it a trendy nighttime dining establishment or a casual grocery cafe?  I prefer the latter, although the restaurant seems to punish me for it.  Granted there are great menu selections and the food has been reliably good.  But the prices are high, the service mediocre, and the interior design more fitting of a Vegas night club.  I would never make this a first choice, although I also try not to complain if dragged there."}
{"text":"I had an awesome time here. This place is rocking after 8:00 p.m. The bar and restaurant was packed and the DJ kept the atmosphere upbeat and festive. The bread and pesto was amazing. I couldn't stop eating it.  I ended up having the ravioli and veal and it was delicious. When the food came my initial thought was that the serving size was a bit small however once I began eating I realized how thick and rich the ravioli was. I ended up being completely full after that entree. I also had the apricot and cheesecake for desert. It was an interesting combination that I've never had before so I wanted to try it. That was just ok in my opinion. I would've enjoyed just plain cheesecake better. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Good spot.  Food is good, service is good, and vibe is good.  Love the patio here.  Another great Sam Fox restaurant.  Food: 3 Service: 4 Ambiance: 4.5"}
{"text":"Excellent food and the waitress was so nice. The place itself is fun too. I came on a Friday evening and they had a DJ. Awesome patio and just a fun evening. I will be back again. Lib this place!"}
{"text":"Olive and ivy remains my favorite restaurant. Their menu changes with the season, but the ahi with snap peas and the cannelloni sweet potato pasta ..my mouth is watering as I type. Their bread and pesto is incredible. They have a few cocktails I really love, and the view is killer."}
{"text":"Great place to get a quick bite to eat before your flight."}
{"text":"I am giving them 3 stars because we made advance reservations for a table of 12 to celebrate my best friends MBA. Upon arrival, they only had a table of 8 set-up for us. We addressed this and they said to go ahead and sit down and they would find a solution. We had to inquire several more times and we even offered a couple of solutions to push together available tables we saw.   In the end, they sat us at two separate tables because they could not accommodate a table of 12. If that is the case, they should have mentioned this very important fact when we called to make the reservation. There were available tables and space to push tables together so I still don't understand why they didn't do it.   The food was good. The service was good. But this one very important detail marred our experience because half of our friends had to sit at an entirely different table and it was very awkward."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The ambience inside is swanky, classy, and unique with wonderful friendly service. Our waiter was fantastic.  I was pleasantly astounded by how amazingly delicous the bruschetta was. Definitely pick 3 for $11 to try as many as possible! We got the proscuitto &fig, manchego, and butternut squash. I was in culinary heaven. I'm not even that interested in bruschetta, but these are an absolute must-get here. They were each an explosion of impressively creative flavors.  From the Small Plates menu we had the Artichoke Hearts, which was a fresh and yummy arugula salad. I was initially most excited about the Lamb meatballs- but this dish was the least tasty and we could've passed on it.   We had the Kale Salad from the Greens section which was very good as well. I liked that they allow half order of salads when you order an entree since when forced to decide between getting a salad and a hearty meal, my vegetable serving of the meal normally loses the battle.  From the Pasta section... omg the Sweet Potato Cannelloni... disclaimer: I love most things made of sweet potato, but this was truly a delicious dish with soft sweet potato center wrapped in pasta, with a creamy mushroom and spinach sauce. We couldn't finish it since we had ordered so much, and I very happily finished the rest as breakfast in bed as my first agenda of the next day.  Overall, one of the best meals I've had of late. Compliments to the chef for a creative and delicious menu."}
{"text":"There is absolutely nothing bad I can say about Olive & Ivy. Of course it's my first time, but the whole experience was gratifying.   We ordered the lamb meatballs which were wonderful, and the focaccia and pesto were to die for... Seriously. People, I am not exaggerating when I say the pesto is amazing. For dinner, my husband ordered the Mediterranean flat bread and I ordered the chicken scaloppini. I loved them both and would highly recommend them.   The place and the ambiance is so fabulous. It's an open kitchen which is so welcoming. The music is spot on, and the patio complements the indoor seating perfect. Overall, the Scottsdale waterfront scene is a must go to, and Olive and Ivy is the perfect place to start."}
{"text":"Love the rest - my oatmeal however this am is basically a bowl of beige mush who knows how long that's over cooked to become that non food like... And no hot tea!  I know it's hard to believe, but not everyone drinks coffee."}
{"text":"only been a couple times, but had Gluten Free options, had healthy options and they were good.  Lastly, they had an organic wine on the menu which was also good.  Love the outside.  Pretty place in general.  Now, the one at the airport... lets just say they need a little work."}
{"text":"Like it they have good coffee and I'm pretty sure their food is good. Nice restaurant and nice staff. The remodeling looks great. I recommend it to anyone more than likely you'll like it for whatever occasion. Very busy."}
{"text":"Been here many times, and also just had our work holiday party here. Classy establishment, excellent food, and nice wines. I love the patio, it's nice and doesn't even seem like you are in AZ anymore. Only knock on this place is that the waiter thought he had free reign during our holiday party and kept refilling our wine like he was replenishing water. Endless wine with no idea how many you have had? You can derive your own results for how that nigh ended up for a few people."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance and atmosphere of this place! The food was excellent. The only slight downfall is the limited menu options. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and will revisit!"}
{"text":"Totally love this place. Friend and I on vacation dressed up to hit up some bars and came here for dinner. Everything was good and service was amazing. Lamb meatballs. Margarita pizza and veal + spinach ravioli. Very trendy place for sure."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and it was delish, I had the salmon Caesar salad and my brother had the turkey pastrami sandwich...YUM YUM...Service was great too..Look forward to going back here when I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"My mother and I ate there last week, and everything was fantastic!  The homemade pasta dishes were incredible, and we also loved our bacon wrapped dates and the bread and pesto.  To top it off, our server was very friendly and made a lot of good recommendations.  Finally, the patio is nice and has a good view of the canal.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Fancy place. Amazing food made right in front of your eyes. We had a blast and enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"This place rocks.  Great atmosphere.  Amazing food and super personable friendly staff.  Everything I've had so far has been incredible; from the humus plate to the bacon cheese burger and my favorite, the beat salad.  A must try!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Really good Mediterranean salad (w/ grilled chicken) and the atmosphere overall was classy and nice. Drinks were just OK; white sangria was pretty meh  Apparently they don't take big party walk-ins so make sure to book ahead if you have 8 people."}
{"text":"We came to Olive & Ivy while in town checking out Old Town Scottsdale. A great spot along the water with an adorable outside patio!  We didn't get a patio seat but the doors open all the way up so even sitting inside, so even sitting inside feels like outdoor seating. There are fireplaces outside, and groups sit together around the fireplaces.   Ambience of restaurant was cozy with great warm lighting and a high-end atmosphere.   Red sangria was delicious!  Scallops on creamy polenta was delicious. Perfectly cooked. Sea bass was also delicious, but I felt that the plate was a little too light on other things. Two pieces of cauliflower and a quarter of a grapefruit left me hungry.  We got the peanut butter mousse for dessert, and that was the highlight for us! Tasted like a peanut butter cup--yum!  Prices are certainly not cheap, so I'd recommend coming to happy hour here, unless you're looking to blow some cash. Overall, great eats in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My friends and I were visiting for the first time for our annual girls trip.  The ambience and decor was beautiful.  Service was amazing.  Location was very nice.  I had the kale salad (delicious), sea scallops (cooked perfectly), and sangria (yummy).  My one friend had shrimp risotto (she said was ok) and my other friend had tortelli (she said was very good).  The dates wrapped in bacon appetizer was really tasty, but the appetizers on crostini were okay.  They serve dinner with fresh baked bread and a basil spread.  So crazy delicious!  We had chocolate cake with marshmallow topping and graham cracker crumble.  It was about a 7 out of 10 for me.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends."}
{"text":"Party of seven; catching up with good old school co-workers. The atmosphere was ideal for a classy casual restaurant near Fashion Square. To start off I'd like to fill you in on the bread and oil, I could not stop feasting on. From the breakfast menu I ordered the two eggs any style (poached) with bacon, potatoes and wheat toast. Of course I had to join the crew on the morning booze choosing of bloody Mary. All-in-all I give this place five stars for excellent service, fantastic food, awesome drinks and location. Duh! ;)"}
{"text":"I came here with a meetup group.  Most of us had never been, and our reviews were mixed.  I had the Mediterranean salad with shrimp (cold boiled shrimp which was fine with me).  Two friends had the fish of the day which they enjoyed.  Two ladies had the turkey hoagie with french fries.  One said her fries were cold.  Service was great.  I feel like it must be difficult to serve a table of ten ladies who all want separate checks.  Our waiter did so with no problem.  He was pleasant and courteous.  I would like to return and maybe sit outside and enjoy a different meal with a smaller group."}
{"text":"On a connection flight to Honolulu, my girlfriend and I had a layover in the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. Starving, we found Olive and Ivy and by our gate, and it looked promising with its long sprawling lines.    Customers can order sandwiches, pastas, salads, and the like, freshly made. If you're in a hurry (like we were), plenty of pre-made items exist and are accessible for those in line. We grabbed two things:  *Turkey Grinder: Fresh tomatoes and cherry tomatoes, with a slick slab of provolone and the oregano was a nice touch. It's something that I would totally get again.   *Chicken Panini: Like the turkey grinder, it had quality ingredients, and the sandwich artists (lol) put generous amount of salami and fontina. The lettuce and tomato were fine.   I would totally return to Olive & Ivy, if I were to visit the Phoenix airport again. It certainly beats airport food"}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant in the PHX airport when I'm connecting to another flight. Considering a lot of airport restaurants have terrible food and slow service this restaurant is very efficient with their limited menu. They serve a limited breakfast menu and mostly sandwiches and salads for lunch and dinner although they do have other items on the menu.The sandwiches are prepped and ready for add-ons which speeds up the process. The food is consistently good. I've never had to wait very long for my breakfast or lunch sandwich and they package up your meal as a good carry out to eat on board your next flight which is ideal since most airplane food is even worse. Overall good food and efficient service."}
{"text":"The food wasn't phenomenal but it was very good. The service was excellent. The decor was very cool. A good experience. Great selection of wines by the glass. Very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Loved, loved the atmosphere. The wine list was great. The food was a good experience being that I have always been a steak and potatoes type of girl. I loved trying the new things. Place was definitely packed on Friday night. We are glad we got reservations and it was a night where my hubby and I fell back in love...would recommend this place to anyone. Just ask questions to the staff when you are unsure about the food."}
{"text":"I ate there 3 times in the last 10 days.  I was waited on by Megan, Nate (as opposed to Nathan), and another gentleman whose name I wish I remembered. The last place I had service that great was at Galatoires's Baton Rouge location.   I thought my first waitperson was exceptionally great, but then I had the same experience 3 times with 3 different waitstaff. Pleasant, friendly, efficient, discreet. I was beyond pleased. No annoying interruptions to ask me how my food tastes (fishing for compliments that add nothing to the dining experience) or to ask if I am done with a clearly finished plate.  The food there is great, too. I recommend the chicken pesto flatbread and the beet salad. They had a special gelato, cherry cheesecake, that I hope becomes a permanent menu item."}
{"text":"Solid happy hour. Good white sangria. Grea view on the Scottsdale Waterfront. We had the bruschetta it was good but not as good as Postino. Great location above average food. Great spot to meet a friend."}
{"text":"Great place to eat or go on a date for sure. tHe atmosphere is great. We ate outside near the heaters and water."}
{"text":"I love Olive and Ivy. I go there for breakfast at the cafe and lunch and dinner in the restaurant. Fav dishes are the ravioli, salmon ceased and burger. Fav drink is peach Bellini. Bartenders are always cool. Servers are decent managers are on point it's a good vibe. It's a bit overpriced but it's at the mall so that's expected. Oh the patio...perfect when the weather is nice! When I don't know what I feel like I go to Olive and Ivy I can find something."}
{"text":"The pesto and bread are DELISH.   God help you and your dining experience if you get stuck with Gino as your waiter. He is slow and rude and unpleasantly loud."}
{"text":"This is  a great spot. I was taken here on a date, we had a reservation for 2 on the patio and I was really pleased with the seating I dont usually perfer outdoor seating,  but at this restaurant id say Its one of the best seats and very gorgeous.  We were seated within just a few minutes of arriving.  The atmosphere is really warm and inviting as well as the staff I really appreciate when Im welcomed immediately by the hostesses it has a huge impact on my perception of a restaurant ( customer service is key and they have it)... The food was very good  also they have a good variety of choices we stuck to a simple  but yummy margarita pizza with fresh basil, bruchetta appetizer,  and drinks. Our waitress was attentive,  but not overly smothering which I liked especially while on a date.  I can absolutely see myself coming back here wether its on a date, with friends, or family...."}
{"text":"The medi salad and pappardelle was really good.. The whiskey sour hit the spot!!! Pretty happening for a Sunday night"}
{"text":"We went here just randomly looking for dinner. It was a nice place.  Food wise: we went with the Bruchetta Brussels sprouts which was ok. Then we had Flat bread chicken which was well made and I highly recommend. Kale salad was also ok. Kale can be difficult to eat but they had some ok flavor added to it.  Ambience wise: This is a total date night spot. If you're looking to impress, go here.  Service wise: They said it might take 45 mins for a table but they got us a table in short fashion. I wish the waiter was as good but he wasn't. He screwed up our order. Forgot to give us bread and we were starving. He couldn't remember to bring my fiancé water also..   Ambience wise: The view is impressive in how it over looks the canal. The Live DJ makes it hip spit as well.. If you're looking to impress your date. Come here.  Overall: Id come back because of the ambience."}
{"text":"I got here at least once a week for either Brunch, Lunch, or dinner. I also thoroughly enjoy the marketplace. Everything from the food to the service is impeccable and by far one of my favorite places to dine in the country. The ambiance is especially notable, with the most pleasing aesthetics and impressively trendy, modern, yet comfortably inviting atmosphere."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  We went here for dinner with our friends and started out with the bruschetta and artichoke heart salad. We got the funghi, manchego(sp), and chorizo toppings. 2 out of three were great, we don't eat pork so we skipped the chorizo one. The salad was very good as well. I really loved the fluffy bread they serve with the pesto sauce! Yummy!  I got the sea-bass...it was the BEST sea-bass I've ever had. The orange peels and grapefruit all meshed so well together. It was just incredible! My bf had the salmon and it was grilled to perfection. It was tender and crispy and those baby beets they serve with it are to die for! And I don't even like beets! Out friends ordered the scallops and the mushroom tort-something and were very pleased with their selections.  Our waiter was super patient with us and gave excellent recommendations. I wish I could remember his name. He was just a great guy and seemed like he enjoyed his job. He definitely went above and beyond for us.  The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because I made reservations for 9:15 but weren't seated until about 9:40."}
{"text":"As I write this, a helpful associate has just checked on me at my seat and has brought me a glass of water. The service at this casual restaurant is better than any regular cafe you'd stop at in town. What makes this place special is their food, the service and the ambience.   Yes, this place is inside a airport, but once you step inside, you forget that you are. (And thank geezus for any place you can go to that makes you forget you're in an airport!!). They sell panini's, loaded pizza squares that look so delicious I could almost break my diet to eat them, salads, soups, smoothies, cookies and breakfast items. Everything is fresh and tastes like it was made with love.  I've gotten their salads plenty of times - never a wilted green in sight. I had the chicken pine nut salad today and highly recommend it! And their tomato bisque never fails to comfort me and lift my spirits after a long business trip.  Treat yourself and try the snickerdoodle cookies. I'm not much of a cookie eater, but I always buy a bag of these to take home. Soft, chewy and perfectly seasoned, you'll wish you bought another bag!  Try this place out for breakfast, lunch or dinner and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast sandwich!!! I was thrilled to find this place and it was quite the popular spot. I would give it 5 stars, but there was only one person taking your order and one person checking you out. Other than that, Jose (the man who made the sandwich) was friendly and helpful. I willed finitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is super fun - great vibe, high ceilings, grand bar, a HUGE open patio over looking the river. We had a private event with about 30 people, and they seated us in a private room in the back. At the end of the night, we moved to the patio where there were several fire pits and a gelato bar in the back. I mean, what else could you ask for..??!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing we were able to be seated outside.  The staff was friendly and the vibe was upbeat."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for afternoon dining on the patio (at least in the spring time).  Nice happy hour menu.  My favorite thing is actually the croissant bought in the morning at their \"market\".  It is perfect - flaky inside and kind of crispy outside.  Treat yourself to one if you're here."}
{"text":"What an awesome, awesome place.  Went here with my mom for a casual friday lunch and really enjoyed it.  The bread and pesto are amazing.  The reason I am giving 4 stars is because the menu is a little too funky for my taste- I am more a fan of the basics.  The dessert menu is also amazing, and all of the desserts are made in-house that day.  Definitely recommend for a nice lunch or dinner! And make sure to get dessert!"}
{"text":"I went to Olive & Ivy in Scottsdale on the waterfront. After hearing good things I went there with my Aunt on a Wednesday around 4:30 pm. The inside was crowded so we had to sit out side. The weather was decent, but it was just starting to get hot out side so the misters were on. We ended up sharing a table with other people, they were nice enough to allow us to sit with them. There was a reason those chairs were empty, the chairs and cushions were wet. We just flipped the cushions over, they were not quite as wet on that side. Other than the crowd and wet chairs I enjoyed the place. I enjoyed the food. The service was great. Good atmosphere, nice decor, friendly staff. I think next time I go it will be a different time of day and or different time of year. We went the third week of May and this year it was warmer than usual. It was not a terrible experience but now I know what to expect and can plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy is a great concept. Fun, classy vibe with a phenomenal waterfront patio, great DJs on the weekend, and excellent food. They even have a gourmet market attached.  We sat on the patio even in summer due to their misters. You can hear the music outside as well. I imagine this place is packed in peak season!  We wanted a light dinner so enjoyed salads and a hummus platter. For dinner we shared tortelli pasta with corn and English peas. It was incredibly fresh and cooked to perfection.   Great cocktail program as well.  Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"The food here is great, amazing breakfast. Only thing wrong is picking up an order. When you call in and place an order for pick up, and they tell you 15 mins Over the phone. I am realistic, normally expect 15-30 when slightly busy, and I am a very patient person but when it takes almost and hour for 3 breakfast items, it becomes and issue. This is unsat, I would expect better service than what happened today."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night after work with a friend. Made a reservation easily with Open Table and was seated immediately. The atmosphere was very nice. I really liked the place. The waiter we had was friendly and helped us decide what to get.   Simply put, great bruschetta and great drinks. Definitely going here again."}
{"text":"The restaurant atmosphere was great, the ambiance was beautiful its right by the  canal and there is outdoor seating as well. The food was brought out to us very promptly and the presentation of the food was great, the thing that impressed me the most was that my boyfriend had ordered the sea scallops and i had ordered the awesome lasagna we had asked to \"split the orders so that we could share\" they beautifully arranged the two dishes on a rectangular plate and a bowl so it looked as though the two dishes were suppose to be together and they split the orders and put it on one plate, I have never seen this done before in any restaurant.The waiter was very attentive and very nice. The other item you need to ask for is the pesto and bread,that is a must, so delish! I even looked up for any other FOX restaurants that might be in California which I plan on visiting since I had such a great experience at this restaurant. the next time I come to Scottsdale I surely stop by here again!. Thanks Olive and Ivy for a memorable eating experience!"}
{"text":"Sub far airport food, over priced, and not super tasty.... My sister enjoyed her Greek salad, I had trouble keeping the grilled cheese down..... Very bland. But it's airport food, so when you don't have a choice I guess it will do... At least there are plugs everywhere to charge your phones, etc. next time I'll grab a bag of chips n try to hold out till I get to my destination!"}
{"text":"I eat here frequently and really like the food, location and outside (along the canal) dining.  The food is very good but a bit pricey.  The ambiance is upscale casual and the restaurant can get very, very loud during busy times.  Staff are always attentive and service good."}
{"text":"Disappointed! We have been coming to this restaurant for several years and came again tonight to celebrate my husband's birthday. We were saddened to find out that Olive & Ivy has cut back on everything food wise. You now have to \"ask\" for their bread and pesto when it was always part of their initial table presentation. The entree presentation is very plain and blah. The food portions appear to be smaller. I notified them when making the reservation that it was my husbands birthday celebration and all the past years the birthday person received a complimentary desert. Not anymore! Nothing was offered. We are so disappointed that they have become a run of the mill, cut costs, restaurant. The food and service are still good but the extras that made this restaurant stand out as a superior FOX restaurant are gone."}
{"text":"Great food we loved the lamb meatballs such a nice Mediterranean item as an app! The filet mignon steak had a great flavor nice and juicy! Sea bass was great too we just didn't like the Mash as it was a bit salty. Service wasn't bad. Our server was nice but not friendly just very direct not sure if that works for working in a restaurant but we enjoyed the food and ambiance"}
{"text":"Two words.... HAPPY HOUR!!!!!   My girls and I went to happy hour last Friday, Olive & Ivy was the first stop, cuz everyone knows HH isn't just one hour. :-)   We had never tried their HH before and wanted to see what it was all about. It's flipping amazing is what it is. Half off almost everything.... bottles of wine, flat bread pizza, salads, sangria, appetizers, beer, cocktails.... The three of us split a couple craft's of red sangria (one caraf = $10 one caraf = two glasses per person) Needless to say we were very much pleased with our HH choice this day.   We also got the margarita flat bread and the pick three cheese plate. So good! If you are looking for a fab HH in Old Town this is the place to be for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing !! Everything I've eaten here is amazing . Try the risotto ! You'll thank me :) unless you're allergic to seafood ."}
{"text":"LOVE their home made gelato! Great scallop & fish dishes. Good home made pesto, though bread served with it could be better (maybe a more rustic, crusty, flavorful bread). Fantastic location by the water."}
{"text":"Another amazing restaurant by FOX Concepts! From the ambiance to the out door seating in Scottsdale on the stream - it was a great experience. Great service and great food. All the food was 100% on point and here is a break down of what we ordered:   Appetizers:  (1) Seasonal Chefs Board - great cheese and meat board. I have had better, but it was great. The breads on the board were AMAZING! (2) Lamb Meat Balls - These were also on point. Their pita bread is VERY delicious and the lamb meat balls with tzatziki was GREAT! (3) Hummus - this is honestly some of the BEST hummus I have ever had. It is flavorful and delicious!  Entree: Lasagna Bolognese - The portion was a great portion and so delicious also. Some of the best Lasagna I have had with pieces and bites of Broccoli, which was new for me, but the texture and taste profile added to the dish. The bread again with this was AMAZING!  Drink:  Grapefruit Mojito - I am a BIG fan of grapefruit, and if you don't like the grapefruit flavor I would not get this drink. It isn't so much a  Mojito but more of a Grapefruit cocktail!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful for larger groups. It has a great outdoor seating area that would be better to visit not when summer's in full bloom. The food is good and it has a great happy hour that I visited with an MBA group. Its also has a great brunch."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, so I think I'm finally qualified to review it. First off, I'll say that this place is gorgeous. They put a lot of thought and money into the look of Olive and Ivy. It's very fancy. Even the bathrooms are impressive - the stalls are like little closets with no way for your neighbor to hear you pooping or to reach under and touch your feet... you just better hope there's paper in there before you start to go. Also, the doors to the stalls are nicer than any door in any house I've lived in. I'm talking big hand carved oak stained wood doors... for toilet stalls.  Anyway - the rest of the place is opulently decorated and well furnished as well. There's a swanky yet sophisticated feel here. The food is above average - as are the prices - though I don't know if the prices reflect the quality of the food. They carry a decent selection of wines - having sampled quite a few, I've decided that the least expensive ones taste best.  The service wasn't great, but it was pretty busy. The layout here would be pretty confusing for any server - but combine that with low lighting conditions and you have a recipe for service disappointment. Our server on my last visit was at least very sweet. In fact, I have yet to feel mistreated here, so I'd say at least they have \"nice\" down.   This isn't my type of crowd - unless you're asking me for a crowd I'd like to see burned alive. But as with many great places in Scottsdale, you may have to bring your own crew in order to really enjoy yourself. This might be a good place to meet up for an early drink or a happy hour snack before heading out for the evening. It's definitely in a great location and like I said - it's pretty nice."}
{"text":"Just moved to Scottsdale in May. My favorite type of food is breakfast. Olive and Ivy has the best French toast in town. On top of this is the great service behind the marketplace counter! The manager (with the beard) is always pleasant with his genuine appreciation for every guest. I frequent this spot and have yet to have a negative experience. Try the parfait served fresh daily with a hint cinnamon. Don't miss out."}
{"text":"This place should be phenomenal....The ambience is awesome and the building is beautiful but the food is so so. I ordered the sea bass and it was so dry it was like smoked fish. The one thing I really liked was the fig and prosciutto bruchetta."}
{"text":"It was our three year anniversary and we were  Treated with kindness and amazing customer  Service.  Olive and Ivy was top notch in all  aspects of service.  Thanks for letting me  Share.  I will be returning for some more  delicious dinning."}
{"text":"I have lived in the valley for nine years and this spot is still one of my go-tos... With a date, with girlfriends, with out of town friends or family. The menu is great for ordering lots of dishes and sharing and you can't beat their happy hours.  The patio is fantastic .... Just be sure to make reservations during spring training season!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night and we were a little late for our reservation because of traffic. Walking in the place is dark, modern, and really loud. We got seated outside on the patio right next to the Riverwalk. Only problem is you can't see the Riverwalk because of the bushes.   The patio has lots of trees for shade covering and water misters. It was a pretty hot night and the misters help cool it down some.   Our server greeted us fairly quickly. Got our drink orders and water cups pretty quickly especially since it was pretty warm outside.   We started out with the Bruschetta comb. We had the Strawberry & Apple, Prosciutto & Fig, and Manchego.  They give you one of each but cut it up into three pieces so everyone can enjoy a variety. They were all good but probably my favorite was the strawberry & apple. They were all very fresh and tasty.   I had the Bouillabaisse. Huge bowl of basically seafood soup. Not a lot of soup but just overflowing with seafood. Muscles, clams, scallops, shrimp, and fish. Everything was cooked perfectly. Excellent dish. Really enjoyed it.   My wife had the chicken Scallopini. Very tender chicken with spinach. I had a bite and and it was delicious. Very good and my wife really enjoyed it. My daughter had the pacific sea bass and her words were that is was cooked perfectly. Very tender and really good. She loved it. Son got the bone-in ribeye and they put some cream sauce on it and he thought it was one of the best ribeye he's had. That's saying a lot there.   We ended our meal with lemon pudding cake and the strawberry Mille-Feuille. They were both really good. Lemon cake was so good. Not dry at all. Very moist with a scoop of ice cream. Really really good. The strawberry Mille-Feuille had three wafer waffles with a scoop of ice cream on top. It was good but the lemon pudding cake was the best in my opinion.   So overall we had a really good meal. Very good service. Really good food. It was pretty loud outside but really warm. It reminded me outside of a garden with lots of tree. Too bad there was no view of the Riverwalk. The outside wasn't as loud and inside. It seemed like people were trying to talk over everyone else so really loud inside. I think I would prefer to come during the cooler time of the year but everything else was really good. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy is clearly the place to be on a Saturday morning if you're a millennial looking to get your brunch on. The building is beautiful inside, offers both quick take out as well as seating if you're looking to linger. Not to be forgotten is the outdoor seating waterside that offers a view of the canal and a gentle breeze on this nice fall day.   We were on vacation, so we started with dessert - a lemon cake that was delicious. They also started us with a plate of focaccia and pesto. The pesto was fragrant and well-seasoned.   I opted for the kale salad with chicken. It was complemented by blue cheese and candied pecans. It is sure to satisfy any kale lover's  hankering.  My husband ordered the breakfast burrito which if consumed entirely will require an obligatory 30min to 1 hr prior to activity. It is filling, and has just the right amount of bacon, cheese, and potatoes. The home fries served alongside were crispy on the outside and delicious on the inside.   Service was excellent, and this place is very reasonably priced. Make sure to stop in for brunch soon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for a late dinner after a long day of hiking while on vacation in the area. This restaurant was wonderful. We had really friendly and prompt service. I wish I could remember our waiter's name because he was attentive and informative without being pushy. The food was very good -- we got a flatbread to start and both had generous helpings of pasta, not to mention the delicious bread and pesto combo that came with the table. We really wanted to try some of the delicious-looking desserts, but our main dishes were too filling. What really makes this place shine, however, is the ambiance. The indoor/outdoor vibe and the trendy atmosphere was perfect for our \"fancy date night\". We loved the feel of the restaurant, with its fireplace tables, soaring ceilings, innovative light fixtures and a wide open concept. I just wish there was an Olive & Ivy in Chicago!"}
{"text":"Very Cute dining. It's perfect for a quick lunch or a dress up dinner. It would be perfect for a celebration or an intimate date. They make their foods from scratch daily and bring you bread while you wait for your meal(s). Their patio seating is really cute and very spacious as well. There is a marketplace adjacent to the restaurant where you can basically order anything off the menu at if you are in a real hurry.   Loved it! It seems that the FOX restaurant chain has yet to completely disappoint!"}
{"text":"Came here for a bachelorette party. Such wonderful service! They greeted us with shots, weren't too on top of us, gave us more shots. When the check came, they gave us our food individually and the carafes  of sangria/dessert on a separate tab. So awesome for a group!"}
{"text":"The easiest way to describe Olive and Ivy is ABSOLUTELY STUNNING.   From the moment you walk in you feel like you're in a whole new world. On my recent visit, i sat out on the patio which felt like I was having lunch and drinks somewhere far from Arizona. The entire patio was nicely decorated and laid out. It wasn't over crowded with tables or anything. The service at Olive and Ivy was beyond great. Everyone walked around with a smile on their face and always made sure everything was going well with your meal.   I highly recommend Olive and ivy for anyone who is wanting an \"out of this world\" experience. It truly felt as if I had just walked out of Arizona and entered a tranquil, beautiful space.   I had one of their Grapefeuit Palomas which are fantastic. Please order one when you go. You will not regret it. They have a great list of wines and cocktails to choose from as well.   I will definitely be returning again soon. This place is amazing."}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful patio to enjoy and this place really has wonderful food. The service was so poor. Will have to seriously consider going back or not because of how poor the service was."}
{"text":"If you like the stuck up Scottsdale vibe this is a good place for you. The food isn't impressive. Nice outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Foods just OK. It is more of a scene. But I will say if you're a guy and want to see some beautiful well dressed ladies then check this place out. Since I'm married to my gorgeous wife i do not need to go here but for you single gents check it out."}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch, drinks, and dinner.  Brunch was very disappointing.  Dinner and drinks were just okay.  Overrated."}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week a couple weeks ago. I usually enjoy Fox restaurants, but for some reason had never come here before. For a starter I had the mini tuna tacos, which I thought were great. The taco shell was really crunchy which went very well with the texture of the tuna.  My entree was the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin. The bacon had a lot of taste, but wasn't overpowering and went well with the pork. It had a bbq sauce that had the right amount of sweet to it. What really made the entree excellent was the side dish. It was sweet corn with roasted peppers and tomatoes. It was great! Best part of the meal by far, and that shouldn't take away from anything else, it was just that good.  One reason I love restaurant week is that I get a dessert with my meal, which I usually don't ever order. I ordered peanut butter chocolate torte...so good. It came with a small scoop of peanut butter ice cream. A perfect way to end a good meal."}
{"text":"Spinach ravioli was great. the portion was perfect for me but I don't eat a lot, I recommend ordering a side with it to be completely satisfied if you're super hungry, other than that the environment is very fun, alive and relaxing."}
{"text":"Not only was the food excellent (I had the prosciutto and potato flatbread with an egg on top), but the service was amazing. The atmosphere is terrific as well. My only complaint is the coffee- I ordered an Americano, and it tasted like drip coffee. With that being said, the coffee was acceptable, and everything else made up for it. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best meal in a long time. Take a credit card, not cheap but way worth the money. Eat dessert. You'll thank me afterwards."}
{"text":"Drinks were so good!! Sat outside on the patio. Open seating on the patio outside and it was really pleasant. We loved the whiskey sour mash, Bloody Mary, and Bellini. Service was great also, Jael was really attentive!! Awesome Sunday drink spot!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a hidden gastronomic gem, Olive and Ivy fits the bill. The Italian/Mediterranean/California influence shows in the decor. The booth we sat in possessed a warmth reminiscent of many upscale restaurants I have been to in Chicago.  Our server, Melinda, was one of the most attentive servers I have experienced. She even did something special for me (mint iced tea) that I will be permanently ordering each time.  The Bruschetta were all delightful with the strawberry being my fave. All flavors were light and enjoyable on the tongue."}
{"text":"We went when it first opened up a few years back, then again in November 2010.....definite change in atmosphere.  Although the food was very good, the service was mediocre at best, the server really had a \"no care\" attitude.  We had to ask for place settings, then our food came out before our appetizers which was very disappointing.  This could be a sign of the times and the business may be circling the drain.  Worth a try though, the food is very good."}
{"text":"Typical airport food breakfast. I was suckered in by the trendy and updated wood and chalkboard appearance which looks like someplace higher-end. Really it's barely edibile, something equivalent to a fast food breakfast. If I had been more patient I would have trekked on to Wildflower."}
{"text":"Must go!! I have been going here for years and every time it is amazing. Awesome location, in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, Waterfront. The outdoor patio is very beautiful and comfortable and a great place to lounge for happy hour. On the weekends they have a live DJ, playing chill lounge music. Atmosphere is what makes this place stand out. The complimentary pesto and focaccia is to die for. Great wine list and drink specials. Mediterranean Mule is my favorite. Service is always spectacular.  I would highly recommend checking this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Was my first time there and everything was simply impeccable. Our service was amazing although she had just moved here from Dallas and the country gravy biscuit and Spicy Bloody Mary with blue cheese stuffed olives  where the perfect end  to my hectic week."}
{"text":"This place is ok. The paninis are a bit dry, but for airport food, I can't complain... it far surpasses McD's!  Stick with the chicken and pine nut salad Or Mediterranean salad for a better meal!  It does take some time to order the paninis, so make sure you plan accordingly.  And definitely choose the rice krispy treat over the snickerdoodle cookie (too much nutmeg!)"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant on the canal, but very busy. My wife's salad was excellent. The brunch menu was limited so I had a burger and fries. Only three stars cause I expected better."}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this place! I would love to just come here and hang out outside. They have these patio seatings with patio furniture where you'll still get waited on and it's just such a perfect seating arrangement! Along with all the seatings inside. The feel for this place is closer to mature like 20-30s. I really really love the set up and would definitely try to make this place a regular spot to hit on a random night. I went on a Sunday and it was still decently busy. I do rate this place four stars though because I had ordered a margarita pizza which I thought was not good at all. I actually didn't finish it. But I did order the melon salad which was three different melons along with goat cheese which I switched it for feta cheese and avocado. I did think the presentation of the food looked very nice and our waiters were rly kind. My boyfriend and I will definitely be back here often!"}
{"text":"O&I at the Waterfront is a very nice restaurant. Their patio has recently even refurbished and is a great place to hang when the weather is nice. The place is very near Scottsdale Fashion Square so the atmosphere is a bit more upscale, but still approachable- I've been here in jeans & a t shirt many times! It's one of my top 5 fav places for weekend brunch - they have $5 mimosas!! And I like that you get to pick your ratios of champagne to OJ as they do them table-side! The restaurant is very large and get a bit noisy at peak times but is a cool vibe! Also good for large crowds and groups dining!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat when passing through PHX Sky Harbor Airport. Consistently Good. A heathy choice with great taste."}
{"text":"We took my parents here for dinner on the water.  The table we had was right next to the water and the temperature was perfect outside.  The waiter was knowledgeable and very attentive.  The Strawberry Thyme drink was good but very earthy.  The Mediterranean Salad was amazing for dinner.  For dessert I recommend the Peanut Butter Mousse, Delicious!  Very pleased and will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"Really good, much better than any other food I've had at an airport. Had the I &O breakfast sandwich. YUM!"}
{"text":"I had brunch at olive and ivy last weekend and had an amazing experience. To start brunch off right I had a mimosa that was way above the average mimosa. He used fresh oj and very crisp champagne. I then got the breakfast sandwich which was fantastic and we shared the cinnamon role (Amazinggggg). The service was excellent and the atmosphere was perfect for brunch!"}
{"text":"The word \"Eh\" pretty much sums up how I feel about Olive and Ivy. It wasn't great, it was terrible.   I came in with some friends when it wasn't all that busy but even that was a bit of a stretch for the staff. I'm not sure if it was just the day I was but they were super understaffed. At first glance, the menu looks awesome but the execution left me wanting. It just seemed like they wanted to put as little onto plates as possible, I'm not sure if they are trying to save money or if the chef thinks it's artistic. Either way, the food is underwhelming.   The location is nice it's just a pain to get too which is pretty much how all of Scottsdale is. But I knew that going in.   Just to reiterate, eh."}
{"text":"Mediterranean salad? Yes, yes, yes, and yes. Add shrimp..of course. The little cafe is great and the patio is wonderful during the cooler months"}
{"text":"Rahim is wonderful. So good at helping us rookies at selecting perfect dishes. Wow. Amazing place food and service."}
{"text":"Seriously my favorite Fox Concept restaurant. Lets begin with there fresh bread and pesto with are to die for. The mediterrean salad is two thumbs up with extra dressing. Seriously cannot go wrong with anything on their menu."}
{"text":"Tips:  The pesto here is to-die-for, a must try Potatoes are diced fried, sort of like \"homefries\"  --------------------------------------  I came here on Valentine's Day afternoon for an afternoon brunch after calling just 2 hours before to grab a table for 2.  We got the vegetable scramble and prosciutto flatbread pizza.   I would highly recommend getting the prosciutto flatbread.  The vegetable scramble was pretty standard and it is not a white scramble by default. What really stood out to me was the potatoes that the scramble came with. The potatoes are delicious and worth getting with your breakfast choice."}
{"text":"This is a 'fresh food' option for an airport.  I especially appreciated their offering of oatmeal-I don't do eggs very often, so airport breakfast can be difficult if it's not a bagel.  Not the best oatmeal ever, but it fit the bill for me.  They had quite a line, but it moved pretty quickly and the staff all seemed focused on getting customers the correct orders quickly."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  I had the lamb meat balls, and some wine. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"If I could I would give 0 stars. I took my girlfriend for our 6 month anniversary dinner thinking it would be a nice dinner. When we arrived the entire restaurant was under construction , the floor was covered in cardboard and looked awful. The appetizers were over priced and tasted bland, the main dish took over an hour and was small and had a disgusting bitter taste to it which made my girlfriend terribly sick. The waiters were awful ignoring guests for over twenty minutes at a time and never refilled the drinks. Overall the worst experience I've had at a restaurant, I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Food, Service and Ambiance was amazing.  Cool looking spot in Scottsdale.  Ordered the bruschetta and it insanely good!  Sea bass was a little over cooked but it was still great.  I highly suggest you go here if you're in town."}
{"text":"Great place by the canal for a waterfront feel. I've had the salmon and the ribeye and both were incredible. As far as cocktails I didn't know what to think of a strawberry thyme martini but it was pulled off really well.  Plan to come back again. Only downside was the bruschetta was a little underwhelming but overall a pleasant experience"}
{"text":"We come here often, and the service and food are always amazing. We often book their private rooms for meetings, and they have always been helpful and on time with all of our requests. The food is fresh, and has many different flavors, and we find ourselves craving it often. The chopped chicken salad is a favorite! Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"Used to enjoy this place, but the last 3 breakfast experiences have unfortunately been subpar.  From a food standpoint, during 2 of my visits I ordered some fried eggs over medium with the yolk runny - both times the eggs were cooked over hard.  The other time I ordered an omelet and the eggs were overcooked and the potatoes were over salted.   Service was also mediocre as on 2 occasions as I wasn't greeted at the register and the employees seemed to be in a bad mood - was a little awkward.  Hopefully there are positive changes that happen soon as this restaurant has a great landscape - probably won't return any time soon as there are several other places that consistently deliver on both food and service for around the same price point."}
{"text":"We went to olive and ivy on a beautiful late- Sunday birthday brunch. The atmosphere was lovely, very visually satisfying, me and my girlfriends sat on the patio with the surrounding of the Scottsdale canal, flowers and plenty of shade. I requested we ask the server, Valentino (sooo handsome) to assist us with a few items to share amongst us. We ordered the chopped salad, French toast, chicken pesto flat bread, Salmon bagel and bacon x 5 plates. We also drank mimosas,that were kept full, with decent champagne and the perfect OJ ratio. The food was average in taste and approach for common dishes, I would suggest more personality to it but it was enjoyable and satisfying none the less. Priced appropriately.   Valentino, our server, was very attentive, very knowledgable and had over all provide exceptional service to \"4 Hangry females from Scottsdale and a birthday girl.\" He kept the table nice and clean, was very informative of the menu and concept and the thoughtful service was more then appreciated. Wonderful service!!!   Over all I rate this as a deserving 4 stars, because it was exactly what I expect from the name and location of this establishment. I will recommend for a lovely brunch spot and look forward to my return."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. The service is always top notch, the food is excellent and the ambiance on the outdoor patio is perfect. It's a true FOX example of excellence in dining."}
{"text":"Maybe I am just an LA girl with LA expectations.  I found most of the restaurants, in Arizona, not up to my taste.   However, Olive & Ivy was  a breath of fresh air.  And I am writing mostly about the ambience.  It was refreshing to find young, trendy people in a place full of energy.  Vibrant décor that came to life as the DJ spins EDM.  The glasses of wine helped too! The food was pretty yummy. I would recommend the roasted mushroom bruschetta if you like balsamic.  The scallop entrée was bit on the sweet side but the rib eye was pretty good.    Appetizer + 2 entrees + 2 drinks + tip = $130 Reasonable.  We will go again...  I can see it being a personal favorite.  A place to go with we are sure in going to be good."}
{"text":"Pretty fricken good experience bud. Had a good time with my bud dirty corey. Drink sangria and stuff had some sick pesto doeeeee. Let's give the overall experience  a Howzitttt. Good but not great. Howzitttt. really had a great time but it's tough to give anything 4 stars if you know what I mean hyddddddd"}
{"text":"Love the decor of this place.  Shabby chic with classy old fashion twist.  I order 3 bruchetta to try : apple caponata, prosciutto and fig and fresh mozorella. Amazing!! Small but perfect appetizer size. For my main entree I tried the prosciutto and mascarpone tortelli. Delicious,  flavorful, and the perfect amount. I paired this dish with pinot grigio. Top it off I had share the brioche pecan and chocolate cake dessert. Too die for.I would definitely ckme back and take my friends."}
{"text":"Went here for a company holiday dinner. Between the aweful service (45 minutes for a refill) the loud, obnoxious music, the dark atmosphere and the food that sounded amazing and was absolutely revolting (I personally took about four bites of one slice of 'pizza' and could not even tolerate to eat it. This is coming from someone who could eat a slice of dominos if needed. Thats how very bad it was.) The dessert we got, I believe peanut butter gelato was horrific. This place is for wanna be hip people. Its actually kind of sad."}
{"text":"Talk about stuffy. Waiter had no personality. Food was ok. From what locals told us, it's a meat market."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my fav place!!! What can I say - love the restaurant, love the food! The staff are pleasant & helpful. I have yet to be disappointed w/ this place!!!"}
{"text":"Scottsdale must eats!   Flavorful food. Nice ambiance and music. Fantastic service. Really enjoyable area and food."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times.  The food is delicious and the ambience is great.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best meals we had in Scottsdale. The service was impeccable.. Our sever, Taylor, knew the menu so well and described every meal to the point we could almost taste it.We picked four different items and each one was incredible. The the deserts, mm. Thank you Taylor and manager for making our experience first rate."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go to for coffee and breakfast and also a really nice meal! I love how it's split up into one side being like a coffee house and the other like a fine dinning restaurant.  Coffee side is by the mall and the restaurant part is by the canal and is absolutely beautiful.  Best part is you can bring your dog with you on the patio and it's in walking distance of a lot of things . Also the food is fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Meh. Went here for dinner on a date night. Have also been for lunch. My overall review is that it's $10 entree quality for $20. Not bad food but definitely not a good value for the price. Like other Fox concepts, the atmosphere is nice but generic, nice in a very trendy way, not classic or authentic. I really don't like to pay steak-house prices for medium food. That's this place.  That being said, I really do like their coffee bar/pastries (mmm the pastries!) and their gelato bar. Then you can sit outside and enjoy the waterfront and only pay a few dollars."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to O&I, and the first time experiencing the \"brunch menu.\" Plenty of lunchable dishes, tho, so while my 3 yr old devoured the perfect thick pancakes with custard and blueberry compote, my wife and I enjoyed two tasty flatbreads - mine with prosciutto (bellissima!) and hers with short rib (get 'r dun!).  The serving size was generous, she barely finished hers and she hadn't eaten yet that day (we arrived around 2 pm), and I got to bring home 3 pieces for a nice snack later. (which she scammed from me!! lucky I love her....)  Everything was cooked perfectly, and delicious. The decor of the place is top-notch, making me feel like I just had my living room decorated by Vern Yip from Trading Places. (always love his designs) Lots of hanging candles, rustic furniture, and an open air feel with a large outdoor patio.  The bakery has a nice assortment  of freshly baked goodies (my son loved the gingerbread man cookies - and I must say, they were still warm and soft - best I ever had) and even gave me a free homemade biscuit for my \"best friend\" at home.   And the prices, though a tad bit steep, are very reasonable for the food quality. Lunch for 3 of us, including a glass of wine and a quenching rasberry mojito was about $60.  The service was just okay, not too attentive, and the waiter, tho friendly, committed one of my most hated pet peeves. As I've said in a review for Ernie's, you are NOT impressing me 1 bit by memorizing my order. Do they not give waiters/waitresses pens and paper anymore??? You could have saved yourself a few percentage points in the tip, if you you didn't have to come back to me 10 minutes later and ask me AGAIN what I ordered. Or say \"You ordered the..........(long pause waiting for me to fill in the blank)....\" Nope! (buzzer) The Jones Family gets a chance to steal!!!  To all servers. Please. I'm begging you. Write down my order. In crayon if you want. Tattoo it on your forearm. Whatever it takes. Just please don't come back to me asking what I ordered. 5 minutes after my meal, I won't remember you, and I won't run home to nominate you for a mensa membership. I just want what I ordered.  (stepping off my soapbox now)"}
{"text":"OK, OK...so I know I'm more than a little late with trying this restaurant, but in my defense I did just move back to AZ a little over a year ago ;).  I happened to be in the area picking up some shoes from Tony's Shoe Repair (which is awesome...a review for that coming soon) and was starving. I was craving something different than the usuals (Kona, Yard House and ZTejas) and I'd heard good things about this place so I decided to test it out solo.   I arrived right at the beginning of happy hour so the place wasn't too crowded yet. I was immediately impressed right when I pulled up to the place. I liked the fact that they actually had parking spots right up front instead of \"complimentary\" valet. It annoys me when that's all places have. First of all, I'm perfectly capable of parking my own car and walking. Second, NO valet is \"complimentary\". You always have to tip them or you'll look like a complete douche. I'd rather walk and burn some calories for free thanks :).   Anyway, sorry for the rant. Back to my review...  The positive vibes of this place stayed with me as I entered into the restaurant. I loved the decor and ambiance of the place. It was very open and fresh feeling. It was airy, without being to too expansive and hollow. It still had a comfort and coziness to it. It was raining that day (I know, what are the odds of that here in AZ haha) so I couldn't sit out on the patio, but from what I saw it looked like an absolutely lovely area to enjoy brunch or happy hour overlooking the water with the girls or even a great romantic date spot to watch the sun go down. The decor wasn't too rustic or too cold and modern. It was classic, cool and elegant.   I decided to just grab a seat at the bar because there were a few seats open and I was by myself anyway. It was sleek and modern and the music was at a perfect volume. It was loud enough to hear, but not so loud that you'd have to yell at the person next to you just to carry on a convo.   Since it was happy hour I decided to take advantage of the great prices and order a few apps as my meal from the happy hour menu. I skipped the cocktails this time (even though they looked delicious...especially the sangria) because I still wanted to go to the gym later that evening...and working out with a buzz just didn't seem like a very productive (or safe) idea lol.   Aside from an ice tea, I ordered the hummus plate, the prosciutto and fig bruschetta (with port salut) and also the fresh mozzarella bruschetta (with tomato jam and basil). This amount would have been a nice snack for two, and was more than plenty for me (I only finished about half the hummus).   The hummus with grilled pita bread came out first and did not disappoint! I loved how they had a good amount of chopped cucumber, onions, and little cherry tomatoes on top of the humus. It added a nice freshness and color to an otherwise monotone dish.   The bruschettas however, were by far my favorite! The tomato jam on the fresh mozzarella was amazing and added a nice twist to the traditional \"mozzarella and tomato\". It was so good that I seriously wish I could get a container of it to go and try it on everything from fries, to sandwiches or veggies. The prosciutto and fig one was amazeballs as well. The saltiness of the prosciutto plays off the sweetness of the fig nicely. I absolutely LOVED everything and can't wait to go back and try even more menu items. So many looked amazing. I was completely full when I left (and didn't even finish it all) all for under $15!   Overall, a great upscale place with great pricing (especially during happy hour), a great atmosphere and most importantly GREAT FOOD! The only reason why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the service. Maybe it's because I was sitting at the bar instead of a table with an actual server, but I asked for a few recommendations and descriptions of certain things and wasn't really given anything except for \"It's good...I'm not sure, whichever one you feel like.\" The bruschetta's were also a little slow coming out.   I still absolutely love the place and will definitely be back with friends for the food and atmosphere. ;)"}
{"text":"the OLIVE & IVY in the PHOENIX airport has a well-trained, well-managed staff. everybody was courteous, efficient and did an exceptionally fine job taking caring of us. not something that happens every time or even very often when you're flying between here and there.   we arrived hungry -- it was a long flight from MINNEAPOLIS and, since we made the mistake of flying US AIR, we ran late (which seems to happen every time we fly US AIR between here and there) and didn't even get a bag of peanuts.  the MEDITERRANEAN PIZZA had a super-thick, doughy crust and was not particularly good but JULIANA, the nine-year old, made short work of it anyway.  JODI, the wife-unit, had the ITALIAN PANINI and the seven-year old a ROAST BEEF PANINI -- both were pretty darn good. especially liked the dense, crusty, chewy bread. WYATT even said he liked the tomatoes on his sandwich -- one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. as a parent, you take the little victories where you find them ...  i had the MEDITERRANEAN SALAD (pre-made to grab-n-go but still fresh) with grilled chicken, almonds, feta, tomatoes, couscous, greens and oregano vinaigrette. nice respite from the meat and starch options i often settle for when we travel.   cost about the same as a flight to LAS VEGAS but when you're hungry and stuck in an airport, what are you gonna do ??  at least the food was good."}
{"text":"Brunch!  My friend and I came in on a Saturday early afternoon. The place was well seated for Brunch. On request I asked to sit by the open kitchen bar, even though it was closed at the time, they were happy to accommodate. Check One!   Got to the bar table and was happy to see busy chefs mastering different areas of expertise. From stone ovens, to open flame grills. The service was phenomenal. Our wait-staff, as it seemed, was great. There were several staff members to help with the menu and movement throughout the meal. Check Two!  I took our server's recommendation of the Egg Sandwich on croissant, with bacon, avocado and a side of fresh yogurt, berries, and granola. The sandwich came out perfectly; wet, but not runny. Check Three! I love seeing the EXTRA detail in service in restaurants. Example would be before my meal came out, they brought a spoon for my soon-to-be-eaten yogurt. Or the fact that there was another craft of lemonade. Check Four!  Having Verdejo Sauvignon Blanc wine by the glass. Check Five!  Thanks Olive and Ivy! I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Love this place. Flatbread pizzas are excellent as was the Mediteranian salad. Pesto flatbread was my fav of the 3 we tried.  We had the ice cream bar but will have the gelato next time."}
{"text":"so this is strictly a brunch review. \"Brunch disclaimer\" I would like to check this place out at night, to wine and dine...but that is another review.  This is a cool place for brunch, good service, good selection, and decent prices (it's even close to Old Town, go figure)  I had the salmon flat bread pizza with creme freshe, capers, and arugula, this was perfectly paired with a nice strong cup of coffee served in a clear plastic glass. (very nice touch) It was a quiet Sunday afternoon, rainy and gray, so perhaps this added a star to my review. (shrugs) So sleep in on Sunday with your partner, lover, F buddy, whatever...have a little \"afternoon delight\", and head over to O & I, for brunch to satisfy you for the entire day. I even had left overs for dinner...very nice, very nice indeed."}
{"text":"Olive& Ivy is great! They have a restaurant and a marketplace, both of which offer tons of great food and drinks. This place is perfect for a date or a luncheon with some friends. Their bacon-wrapped dates...holy balls, talk about memorable. If you get lucky and the patio is open, sit outside for a completely different experience from what you'll get inside. Their patio furniture is adorable and sits on the water. Inside, the vibe is very trendy and upscale, while still remaining relatively casual.   Overall, O&I is a great place to hit up after a long day at the mall, whether you want to sit down or grab-and-go."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service for Christmas Eve dinner... minus the refrigerator effect  Our family has a tradition of visiting a nice restaurant for Christmas Eve Dinner. From the Brown Palace in Denver to the US Grant in Sand Diego to the Phoenician in Scottsdale, it's a special occasion to celebrate with relatives.  This year, we decided to stay closer to home and agreed on Olive and Ivy for the cuisine and Yelp! ratings. It was a very good fit.   Our service person, Jessica, did a fine job-- accommodating of taste preferences spanning grandparents to children, kept the timing of courses on track, and made sure drinks were never more tan 1/3 to empty.  Bruchetta Trio was worth a try even if it was unremarkable. Hot chocolates hit the spot on a cold Scottsdale evening. Mediterranean salad, kale salad, and the plate of artichoke hearts were superb-- especially the latter.  Just as excellent, the rib-eye was supremely tasty and perfectly cooked, my wife was very happy with her salmon, and my father-in-law said the shrimp risotto was worth coming back for. The cheesecake was also good, though we were all so sated and chilly that it was a forced attempt at dessert.  Speaking of chilly: One (BIG) knock is that there is a well-used door in the back room. When wait staff traversed in and out, it sent 40-degree air our way. And when an inconsiderate family was finished eating, they held the door open for a good five minutes as everyone sauntered out. A waiter finally noticed and came to have them close the door as I got up to ask them to not freeze us any longer. The result was the same: We ended up eating most of our meal with our coats on us and our food quickly lost its heat. I'm docking one star just for that poor experience and for no one noticing or making a good effort to fix things. Could just be that it's southern Arizona and they aren't used to looking for people eating with coats on, but still...  Definitely worth the visit and I suspect the chilly letdown we had was an anomaly. The food and service staff were quite good."}
{"text":"Typical Italian eatery.  Nothing to brag about.  Happy hour bites are average and drinks are standard.  I wouldn't really say it's the best place to go but for food but the atmosphere is great.  Any seat you take is fun and inviting.  Open seating outside by the water is relaxing and so is the seating inside the giant space that they have.  The service can be a bit slow when it gets busy.  Overall might be a spot to stop after shopping or a glass of wine between walking around the area."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Olive and Ivy, I am a BIG fan of Fox Restaurants so I was excited to come here.  We went on a Friday night about 6pm and we got a table with no wait!  They brought out some AWESOME Bread with an incredible Pesto Sauce, Yummy!  I ordered the beet salad with arugula, goat cheese & pistachio.  I was NOT disappointed, highly recommend!  This was my dinner, I think I had to much popcorn at the movie before. :)  Between the salad and bread I was satisfied and not to full for desert!  We shared a desert, Apple Tart, Very Good!  My mother had the Mediterranean Salad and a Friend had the Lasagna and both said their dishes were good.  Service:  Our server was very attentive!  The only reason I did not give Olive and Ivy 5 Stars was because it was too noisy in the restaurant.  I have noticed more and more restaurants are going for the cement floors that lend to a nosier atmosphere."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined outside on the patio while visiting Scottsdale. The bruschetta appetizer was amazing, as was the sweet corn flatbread pizza. We highly recommend it and would definitely come back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Aside from the map showing a wrong location, everything about this restaurant was right. The pesto they serve with the complimentary bread was to die for. It was so good I slathered it with my flatbread order of Prosciutto Crudo. They serve brunch on weekends (both Saturday & Sunday) until 3pm which is ideal when you don't like time constraints in the weekend mornings (meaning noon or after). The $5 mimosa was in a huge wine glass instead of a slender champagne flute. Service was fast & good even when it seemed crowded."}
{"text":"I visited Olive & Ivy on a weekday evening in October. It was PACKED. The patio is mostly open seating. I had the margherita flatbread pizza and it was good. Our group also had a bottle of sangria. The patio was the perfect place to relax after a day of work. It wasn't too warm in the evening and the decor was perfect. 4 stars."}
{"text":"I was so hungry after my 6 hour flight, I decided to stop by Olive and Ivy to grab something to eat. The breakfast club sandwich was super delicious and the workers were very friendly. :)"}
{"text":"I travel a lot and spend a lot of my time at random airports around the world. Over the past 2 months I have passed through the Phoenix airport 5 times.  I have tried this place 4 times. I have to say I have been very impressed with the food.  It is a much fresher and healthier option then most airports offer.  I would give this place a full 5 stars, but the service has been poor each visit.    The first visit I thought it was a fluke.... I ordered a roast beef panini... After 20 min of waiting I went up to ask where my sandwich was and they had lost my order.  My second and third visits I had to ask someone behind the counter to take my order....in both cases the employees were just chit chatting behind the counter....  This is an airport place....I would assume most people passing though are like me and are in a hurry.  Sitting around waiting for employees to finish personal conversations is not an option.    That being said... The food is good."}
{"text":"Sometimes I think people are too hard on Olive & Ivy, the beauty of this place is how simple your meal can be (if that makes any sense)!   Although there are some $$$ items, there's also some fantastic reasonable dishes. Here's my idea of a wonderful Olive & Ivy dinner- a drink on the patio along the canal, then sit at a booth inside and enjoy truffle fries with the aioli dip PLUS the house focaccia bread with pesto to start. wow. Then I eat the chopped Mediterranean chicken salad to make myself feel better. The salad is AMAZING. Beautiful place, very romantic. It's probably my fav Fox restaurant. Other items on the menu are great too like the fish and risotto.   I think the service is great, although you can tell the server is bummed I'm not ordering more expensive stuff, but who cares!!?! Still a great experience."}
{"text":"This place is big, open and beautiful but their menu is limited so we usually just go here for drinks. However, the last few times, it was too crowded."}
{"text":"Great service, location and food! The short rib flatbread was a fan fave in our group. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I just had a great experience at this restaurant. From the location, server, menu and decoration, it was a perfect day anniversary night for my husband and myself Please if you go there I will recommend to order the wild Mushroom Parpadelle and the Lamb Meatballs, but I am sure anything you have it will be delicious Until the next time Olive and Ivy"}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting Arizona. We ate at Olive and Ivy twice while we were here. The food is excellent and the service was top notch!   Our waiter and manager, Marc Anthony was the best! He rolled out the red carpet for us and gave us recommendations for the rest of the week.   We will be back! I highly recommend this place! A+"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and friendly server but the food was super average. Looking back we probably shouldn't have gone the tapas route as the options were quite limited, but as New Yorkers this is what you usually do at a \"Mediterranean\" style restaurant. We did the brushetta trio (two were great, the pear was bland) and the bread was not brushetta style at all (was thick bread rather than thin). The artichoke hearts were good but sort of more of a salad than we expected. The lamb meatballs were fine but nothing memorable. The kale salad was super boring, consisting almost entirely of kale and very little toppings. Overall, I think we would come back for a drink only and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"I went to Olive & Ivy last Friday night while on a girl's trip to Scottsdale and really enjoyed the restaurant. We made a reservation earlier in the day but when arriving to the restaurant realized that we wanted to set outside (the back patio is very cute and quieter). The bar scene is pretty good and I really enjoyed the red sangria. We ordered a bunch of items to share and everything was delicious. I recommend the roasted veggie crostini, the arugula salad, and the sweet corn and margarita flat breads. I'd give the restaurant 4.5 stars - the service was fast but our server sounded like he was reading off of a script in his head and didn't really understand the food or wine menus."}
{"text":"My wife and I had one of the best meals tonight. The bruschetta was excellent, the scallops were excellent and the peanut butter desert was superb. Chris was our waiter and really knew his menu and guided us to some really great choices.  I would highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, even though it didn't come out how we requested (ordered the steak with no sauce, came smothered in it- no big deal except it's the most expensive item on the menu). The WORST was that my boyfriend ordered a couple glasses of 18yr Macallan before I ordered one. I don't know what they brought me, but it certainly wasn't the 18 year, though we still got charged ($$$) for it. We did a couple blind taste tests just to be sure... Maybe they thought I wouldn't be able to tell the difference? They should be ashamed. The food was pretty good, but really overpriced. We sat outside and the atmosphere was nice. Definitely will not be back and will never recommend this place. For the money we spent, our dinner should have been flawless."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic experience dining at Olive & Ivy! Believe it or not, we even thoroughly enjoyed dining outside in the August Scottsdale swelter- their misting system works amazingly well.  Went with my daughter and two of her friends- and I totally loved this place! I liked the high ceilings, the cozy decor, the lighting, and the marketplace feel of the interior... Because of numerous raves on yelp, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer. It's true, they are totally fabulous- not to be missed!   I had chicken scaloppini, which was delicious- perfectly prepared, and served with just the right amount of sauce and Mediterranean olives. The girls all ordered pasta dishes- raved about, and then subsequently demolished them. There wasn't one crumb of food left on anyone's plate!   The focaccia bread with pesto is wonderful, and they have a great wine list here. I had a glass of Syrah from Washington state, which was thankfully served at the right temperature and was very nicely balanced. We were celebrating one of my daughter's friend's birthdays, so our delightful waiter brought us a complimentary dessert- an \"ice cream bar,\" which had ice cream, marshmallow, and lots of rich, luscious chocolate. It was totally delicious, and reminded us of a s'more.  Olive & Ivy is a nice place to people watch- the patio fronts the waterfront, and reminded me of a sidewalk cafe in Europe. I will definitely be back- only wish we had an Olive & Ivy in Tucson!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past few months for a quick solo lunch and a laid back Saturday brunch.  For lunch I sat at the bar and received prompt service and a friendly banter from the bartender. My glass never stayed empty and my Lamb Gyro was sent over right on time....and oh my was that thing delicious! I finished my meal with a decadent blackberry vanilla gelato from the marketplace.   A little while later I chose it again for a casual brunch with my visiting sisters this weekend. Being from LA, I knew they'd appreciate the atmosphere and decor. We opted to sit outside on the gorgeous patio. Our server was warm and genuine, and he spoke enthusiastically about his favorite meals.  We ordered bellinis that arrived in big, fat glasses filled with perfectly peachy effervescence. The bread and pesto was just divine. It's clearly fresh and house made; didn't take us long to devour it all. My veggie scramble was perfectly made accompanied by whole wheat toast, softened butter and housemade strawberry jam.  My sister's turkey grinder was a bit heavy on the turkey but light on the lettuce, tomatoes, pepper and oregano that was supposed to give it flavor. It's Definitely a sandwich for someone who likes their protein.  It was my other sister's Lamb Gyro that stole the show. Again, tasty, perfectly done Lamb with the right balance of ingredients."}
{"text":"Over rated, not bad by any means but definitely doesn't live up to the hype and I don't understand why its constantly busy other than location.  Mediocre food, mediocre service, great location."}
{"text":"I had been to Olive and Ivy before for wine and flat-breads on the patio and thought it was good, but when we finally came for dinner on April 24th, the experience was excellent. We didn't have a reservation, so we made our way to the bar for a glass of wine. The hostess texted us when our table became available, which was a large comfy booth clad in a beautifully patterned fabric. Our waiter was engaging and attentive, and the food was superb. The people watching is added bonus, there were lots of interesting sleeve tattoos on the staff, and tables of rich blonde debutantes.I noticed a couple of metrosexual guys at the bar with Restalyn injections and nose jobs (which is a pretty common sight in Scottsdale).  Anyway about the food, we started with the hummus and veggies which was obviously house made and delicious. My entree was the Pacific sea bass, which, as the waiter explained, is substituted with a cousin to sea bass that is not endangered but just as tasty. The braised cauliflower was great, and the portion was perfect. The preserved grapefruit was the perfect touch, the dish needed no augmentation. My partner had the scallops which were amazing, and our relatives had the filet and added a small side of shrimp to make it a surf and turf, they loved it. We shared a lemon tres leches cake with berries for dessert that was mouth watering. The place is always packed and it's easy to see why. Beautiful ambiance and terrific food!"}
{"text":"This looks like a classy place to have dinner and a few cocktails with friends... We headed here for drinks after dining at Blanco.   The place was less busy than I remember, making us scoring a prime outdoor seating location possible... The seven of us enjoyed several well-made cocktails and had a very nice, attentive server.  I will be back to sample their food and their renowned happy hour..."}
{"text":"Not only is the service amazing, the food is also amazing!! Julia, our waitress was really nice and checked on how we were doing a few times. When we asked to pack our food to go, she even wrote what was in it and the date on it. The bread and the pesto sauce were amazing and really flavorful. The mushroom, mozzarella and avocado bruschetta were all delicious. The mozzarella was a bit spicy but still tasted really good. It actually made me change the way I thought of bruschetta. The sea scallops were perfectly cooked and so so yummy!! The creamed corn tasted really light and is perfect for a hot day in Arizona. The lasagna bolognese was served in a bowl and tasted great with the garlic bread."}
{"text":"Love, love love! I love this patio! It sure doesn't feel like you are in Arizona... It is a breath of life from wine country. You can see the European influence, but also the laid back, sitting on a good friends vineyard patio where beyond the trees is rolling hills, orchards and elegant rural life. All this and only steps away from the lavish Scottsdale Mall! The menu is well thought out and a certain amount of effort was clearly put into the bruschetta list's 6 tempting creations: All refined and elegant in their execution and piled high with toppings. The bruschetta sell for $4-$5 each, or 3 for $11 - A hell of a deal! And be sure to try the Manchego with quince & Spanish chorizo, aaah-mazing!   The other wonderfully yummy price point find is the single scoop of in-house made sorbets and gelatos, $1.75 for a single scoop! I had the lemon butter cream and it was divine. Rich, creamy, with a lovely lemon finish.   The wine list is thorough and poignant. There are not 6 different Chardonnays and 4 Sauv blancs. But approximately 9 whites and 12 reds by the glass with only 1 selection of each type of grape: One fabulous vintage for all occasions! I really adore this concept.   The restaurant is inviting and as large as the desert that surrounds this city. My server was outstanding, you rock Lauren!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The atmosphere is great and they are busy so make reservations in advance! Our waiter was very nice and the other staff was great too. The music they play is a mix of old school and new pop remixed together and I loved it!!   They have outdoor seating with individual fire pits that looked gorgeous but since it was New Years and I didn't want to ruin my hair we sat indoors.   I had the bruschetta but since I'm vegetarian we got 3 of the same mozzarella ones and it was so good! The sauce is a little on the sweet side but goes well with the mozzarella and basil on top. So good!   My boyfriend had the lobster risotto and he said it was absolutely amazing. The serving was smaller than he expected and despite not being very hungry... he finished it ALL.   The vegetarian options are limited so I had the margarita pizza from the appetizer section and it was okay. Nothing too special.. I probably should've tried the sweet potato dish because I'm sure it would've been amazing!"}
{"text":"Such a big place, with lots of things going on!  If you like open flames, you may find it fun to watch their open-air kitchen.  The service was quite good, and they have bottles of wine for almost any budget with a knowledgeable staff.   Their lamb and couscous dish was decent, though after seeing the rib-eye steak, I should have ordered that... The fish also looked quite good.   Also, get the peanut butter caramel sea salt chocolate mousse - it's good enough to eat it every day in place of a bowl of cereal, and it's just about as big! (I'd figure out how to make it at home if it didn't have so many calories...)   You could of course choose to get just the mousse and skip dinner... and I wouldn't hold it against you, though you might want to compliment it with the chocolate-chocolate-chocolate cake and an espresso when you do just so you don't pass out from the sheer weight of all the amazing calories you've eaten!   The espresso after dinner was an excellent addition to the mousse.  Stay hungry!"}
{"text":"As soon as I saw this restaurant had opened in Scottsdale, I just HAD to try it!   It's really new and is located toward the back of the new Waterfront location in Old Town.  GREAT place!  I absolutely loved it.  Just from the look of it, I was anticipating that the menu would have pretty pricey items on it.  But I was pleasantly surprised to see that their Sunday brunch menu was VERY reasonable.    First off, the actual restaurant is gorgeous!  They have a really charming, adorable patio that is great for enjoying a sunny Arizona day (plenty of opportunities for that!).    Next subject...the food!  Definitely a gourmet feel with a hint of familiar additions like tator tots! ;) I noticed something on the menu called the croquet madame.  It sounded a little different, a ham and cheese grilled sandwich with a fried egg on top and some weird sauce that I could barely sound out!  Weird means that I definitely had to TRY IT! lol  It was soooooo delcious!  I savored every bite!  The different flavors errupted in my mouth! yum yum yum!   I have no doubt that their dinner menu is fantastic as well.  I will most definitely be checking it out again when I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"Salmon was okay but nothing special. It came with a few beets and potatoes. Bar service was a little slow."}
{"text":"Great-tasting restaurant- if not one of the best at which I've ever dined. My group of ~15 was able to sit in the private dining room with the beautiful round table- perfect little room with warm, romantic lighting. Our server greeted us enthusiastically as we entered, and never wavered in service the entire meal.  We were fortunate to be eating during Restaurant Week- most of us chose that menu since the rest of the menu was a bit pricy. Because I'd done my research beforehand, I had a decent idea of what I wanted to order. I'd never even had a date before but selected the wrapped dates! Absolutely delicious. My second course was the scallops, and I wish I could've finished it, but I had to save space for dessert. The apple spiced desert was one of the best variations of apple pie I'd ever eaten, all in a cute little serving jar. If I had to give Olive & Ivy room for improvement, it would be the drink specials. Not sure if the few I had were worth the $10-15 price tag/per."}
{"text":"After a really bad experience elsewhere, I needed somehing positive. Olive & Ivy came through. The Mediterranean pizza was delicious and a generous portion. The grab and go salad was fresheven at 8:00 PM. WOW!!!   The service was quick and extremely pleasant."}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy is a solid choice in the Scottsdale area for a decent lunch and a glass of wine. I probably wouldn't wait more than 25 minutes for a table, there are other restaurants in the area I would prefer to eat at.   I had a business lunch here the other day, we split the bruschetta (the pear and avocado options were delicious). I ordered the Mediterranean salad (much larger than I was expecting but a decent salad).   We were lucky enough to have good weather and could enjoy the patio and view of the canal."}
{"text":"I am between a 3 and 4 on this place.  I love the location and sitting on the patio was beautiful.  A friend and I settled for a leisurely evening of catching up, having some appetizers and drinks.  The service was good and it was bad.  They were attentive but maybe too attentive.  It is bothersome to me when they take away a plate when there is still food on it (and don't ask) and take away your drink when it is almost still half full.  Those are just silly mistakes.  Otherwise, the hummus, bacon wrapped dates. lamb meatballs and gnoochi were all worth the calories. Dessert not so much (I think it was the ice cream bar).  I think it is definitely a great place to spend some time and hang out."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for a special occasion. The food is fantastic and the service has always been amazing. If the weather permits try to get a table outside near the water because it will make the experience just that much more amazing! Make sure to come hungry and order the bruschetta. There are many different types to pick and choose from."}
{"text":"This place was sooo good! Everything was raw and organically sourced. Our server was the sweetest and our seat was right by the waterfront.   Great vibes! Perfect place for brunch :)"}
{"text":"We stop in here a lot after our Saturday runs for breakfast.  The location near the canal is nice.  They have some delicious pastries and berry yogurt.  Also have been here for dinner.  We've found it is a nice place to take guest as it has a huge patio with lights stung across."}
{"text":"Went here for a moms night out and loved it!! We showed up early for our reservation and they got us right in. The ambiance was great and the food was amazing. The waiter was very attentive. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Note to self next time: Make a reservation if you plan to go on a Friday night.  This was my first time here & I definitely underestimated how busy it might be. I took a friend out for her birthday & when I walked up to the desk to ask what the wait was she said the next available table was at 9:30! (Mind you it was 6:15) But we had the option to sit at the \"chefs table\" which ended up being really cool anyways.  Landiss was our server & he was great! He grabbed our stuff quickly & was really friendly. I love it when I can go to a place & the people act like they genuinely enjoy their job, & he did just that.  Food: Bread & pesto is killer. Non negotiable. For a starter I got the Artichoke Hearts which were tasty & well cooked. My entree was the Wild Mushroom pappardelle & that was really delicious. I wish there was maybe a little more cheese or sauce going on, but it was still good. I also liked that I was able to be a pain in the butt & get a couple Jameson Mules even though its not on the menu. :)  I enjoyed this place & it had a great atmosphere. Will definitely be back, but next time Ill make reservations."}
{"text":"Went here 2years ago in May, Great ambiance and atmosphere if you don't mind the testing of lighting and waiters stumbling around and starring at you. It was my birthday and Upon moving here a guy on my flight told me to check this place out. For a special occasion I think I would recommend to pass, For an afternoon of tv and football sounds great. This place is like an Italian Applebee's! So if you like Applebee's great, go. I obviously am not..a fan of Applebee's"}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect! Olive and Ivy is class all the way. From the hostess stand to walking out the door nothing but magical.The bacon wrapped dates are amazing. The mousse dessert was delicious. The restaurant and patio are beautiful! Staff is top notch. Will recommend and will be back again and again."}
{"text":"A truly classic fox restaurant. Bacon wrapped dates stuffed with Italian sausage, utterly delicious. Roasted artichoke hearts as good as it gets.  The wild mushroom pappardelle pasta was fantastic and The sea scallops with white polenta were equally scrumptious.  Energy filled vibe, good wine list, excellent service and a really nice atmosphere. This  is a \"go to\" for me when I am in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I was so excited to eat here at Olive and Ivy on my visit to Scottsdale! The setting was lovely, but the service and judgement was nothing that I expected. Our food was DELICIOUS! Until I found a beard hair cooked INTO the dough of my pizza. Our waiter visited before and to take our order, but we did not see him after that until our bill. Water was empty, and my food had hair in it and after waiting almost ten minutes for our server to come and check on us I got up and retreived another staff member. The manager did offer us new pizza but did not seem to sincere with his apology (most likely because we are a group of young individuals). I would liked to have seen it at least taken off of our bill because we did not get to eat together. It is not about the money, but more so the lack of judgment in the experience. I am very disappointed, I've had better care at a Red Lobster. I'm very sad to say that I do not want to dine here again, nor will I recommend it to any Scottsdale friends."}
{"text":"OMG their balsamic artichoke pizza is AMAZING. I come here just for that dish. Restaurant is super cute. Love this place"}
{"text":"What a brunch hot spot.  I was with a group of 9 girls for a bachelorette and failed to make Sunday brunch reservations.  We showed up at Olive and Ivy right when they opened at 10AM and were seated immediately outside at a really nice set of comfy couches and chairs.  All of our cocktails were delicious and we loved the fresh bright pesto with warm bread.  There was a coffee shop in the restaurant for those of us who needed more coffee. This was a perfect gathering spot to play a few bridal games and talk.  The seating and ambiance of the patio were perfect and service was very attentive but not too much."}
{"text":"A small bottle of water cost me $3.56. I cursed myself when I found out that PHX airport had water filtration at their water fountains. Bring your water bottles & fill up; don't get gouged."}
{"text":"Looks like there are some haters out there!  This place - in no way - deserves less than three stars in any opinion. It is at least A-OK folks. You may have a bad experience individually, but the negative review I read were just a little snobby.  Beautiful place. Great focaccia and pesto... but go easy, Killer, or you will spoil dinner.  Tasty flat bread pizza... The asparagus/shroom combo was fine, but you must like a pronounced shroom flavor.  The Mediterranean salad was a nice balance of color, flavor, and texture."}
{"text":"A+ for ambience and atmosphere. The outside area at night is BEYOND romantic and gorgeous.. And the inside is just as cool.  I had the salmon Caesar salad which was pretty yummy and oddly filling? Haha Or perhaps I was already full from the absolutely amazing basil/pesto/olive oil spread that was served with our bread. Regardless, it was a good-sized salad.  My fiancé had the spinach and veal ravioli which was downright melt-in-your-mouth amazing. While it could've probably been enough for me, he arrived starving so he was still somewhat hungry after finishing his meal in a whopping 5 minutes.  Luckily we had the bread and he had some of my salad but I do have to admit it couldn't have more than maybe 8 ravioli pieces? And for the price, that definitely wasn't enough.. Hence the 4 star rating vs 5 star.  We'll still be back.. I love their patio area and wine selection, maybe this time we'll get an app for my fiancé!"}
{"text":"Great place and awesome food! This is in a great location, with good customer service and has outdoor seating for relaxing conversation and food!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance both indoors and outdoors. It's the best to sit out in the patio when the weather is nice out with a glass or bottle of wine . Food is great but the alcohol here is better . Price is average for old town. Highly recommend! Cute date and brunch place!!"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean salad w chicken on the planet. I moved to San Francisco and have yet to find a salad I am as passionate about as this one. Also they used to have this flatbread w corn and goat cheese that was to die for. Their bread and pesto is also dank. 5 stahssss!"}
{"text":"Went on an off hour late dinner on a Saturday night. Definitely pricey but well worth for the service and food. Great atmosphere, low light good for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! One of my favorite eateries in Scottsdale. The food and drinks are all phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Food is terrific and the outdoor patio is the best seat in the house if you can reserve it :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food and beverage menu. Great atmosphere! As long as it isn't too hot, grabbing a seat on the patio is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Arrived on a Sunday around 1PM about a month ago and was promptly seated in the dining area.  If you prefer, you can also visit their connected take out area.  Service excellent, although on a Sunday there were several screaming children and very loud large groups, but that's expected when you eat out so can't complain too much.  If you are a fan of pesto, you will be pleasantly surprised to taste the complimentary pesto w/warm, fresh bread.  I could have just ate that all afternoon! Delicious!  I ordered tomato bisque which was the absolute best tomato bisque ever!  If I were in the area I might try this place again, although there are so many other nice restaurants in the area I've yet to try that I'd probably opt for one of those."}
{"text":"Had brunch on the patio, it was a sunday so it WAS very busy but worth the wait. Kind of annoying that I ordered a mimosa first thing after being greeted and didn't get it until after I got my meal. It was all tasty none the less. I've been there several times since and everything that I've tried on the menu has been great. Love the atmosphere, if it is nice out sit outside!"}
{"text":"Sometimes very busy, but you can get a seat at the bar instead of waiting for a table.  Their Gyros is the best in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy never fails to disappoint! I've been there for business meetings, date night and meeting up with friends, and it's always great! It's definitely one of my favorite Fox Restaurants, and the Scottsdale location is right on the Waterfront in Old Town.   If you're visiting, it's great in the summer or winter, but especially good when you can dine outside. You can also walk from Olive & Ivy to the rest of Old Town, without having to take another cab.  My recommendations include:  -bacon wrapped dates - just phenomenal here! -bruschetta - lots of options, and some claim that they're the best in town. I like the fig & prosciutto.  -scallops - creamed corn and bacon gastrique? So good! -the filet - I haven't had this yet, but my co-workers said it was the best filet that they've had in AZ. At $39, it's not cheap, but these guys know steak and were thoroughly impressed!  Visited September 2015"}
{"text":"Wow, fun place for a drink and appetizer after 3 hours of walking,shopping,etc. A lot of people in a great atmosphere. Fun \"Happy Hour\"place even better at night for dinner. Beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"Very nice place to take guests, it has an ambiance that is upscale yet not pretentious. The servers are nice and the food is pretty good. Their happy hour is nice for wintertime since you have to sit outside on the patio to get it. My only complaint is how the food costs an arm and a leg and has portion sizes not even fit for a child..."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday last night. I love the atmosphere but the food ... I'm on the fence. We started off with the fritto misto. Very soft, tender, not too breaded. I think that might be my fav so far. For entrees, we had the bouillabaisse, bone-in ribeye, and lasagna. The bouillabaisse was okay. My friends liked it. The broth lost flavor when dipped with bread. The lasagna is just lasagna and how can you go wrong? Lastly, the bone-in ribeye. Now, I'm the type of girl who an eat steak everyday, or every other day. I have eaten steak for 7 days straight. That's how much I love steak, and bone-in....yes! After having a bone-in ribeye at Steak 44 last week, I couldn't wait to eat another. By all means, I'm not comparing. But the creamed spinach was so rich that it took over the flavor and there was no steak to taste. Totally disappointing. If I were to order the steak again, I would ask to substitute the creamed spinach and not have any foods touch my steak. Also, it seemed like the chef really likes butter. I mean, probably not the healthiest dishes. I would come back but not order the same dishes. I'll keep you updated along the way...."}
{"text":"Loved this place!!! The ribeye steak and creamed spinach was delicious, the ambiance gorgeous and the service left nothing to be desired. 4 people and $172 dollars later so glad the driver suggested this place and next time I'm in Phoenix I'll make it a point to come back."}
{"text":"Watch out what time you go. Lunch menu switches over to dinner at 3. You can't order anything off the lunch menu and half the dinner menu is still blocked off as they prep the kitchen. So expect between 3 and 4pm is relegated to salads and flatbreads, but its also happy hour. Happy hour only applies to the bar and outdoor lounge though. Overall great food, nice weather on good days, and beautiful area."}
{"text":"5 stars ain't enough.   This was easily one of the Top 5 meals I've had in my life (in its price range). A big thank you and hats off to our server Jeremy, who did an excellent job in providing us with superb customer service!!! He is everything a perfect server should embody :-)   Honestly, I came in with low/medium expectations because this place reminded me of a fancy version of Lemonade (a chain restaurant in California) serving Californian cuisine, which is good, but not my favorite. Jeremy assured us that their cuisine is more Mediterranean than Californian so that made me instantly happy!   On to the food-   COMPLIMENTARY BREAD W/ PESTO- AMAZING!!! The pesto sauce is the best I've ever had. It was thick and packed with flavor, loaded with pine nuts, and not overly drenched in olive oil. The bread was light and fluffy- off to a great start  CHEF'S PLATE ($18)- GET THIS. I dream about this plate. I was hesitant to order this at first seeing that it's pretty pricey for an appetizer. This could easily double as an entree, but I would still recommend getting it even if you already ordered an entree. This was one of the BEST charcuterie boards I've had. I could rave about this for the rest of my life. Plat included: * 2 kinds of bread- a buttered, light & crispy artisan bread + an extremely soft loaf of bread that melts in your mouth. 2 kinds of artisan cheese- one strong gorgonzola + brie-like soft cheese. * 2 kinds of meat- spicy salami + prosciutto * a LOT of olives, dates, pistachios, and pickled lettuce.  I loved all the contrasting textures and different tastes of this. My taste buds were doing backflips! I found myself still digging at this even after I finished stuffing myself with my meal. By far my favorite!!!   BACON-WRAPPED PORK TENDERLOINS ($24)- These pork loins were perfectly caramelized and had this EXTREME melt-in-your-mouth quality. My knife sliced through them like butter and it was the perfect amount of chewy and tasty. Came with yummy mini potatoes, collard greens, and polenta. This was such a good choice and is one of the more filling meat plates, as mentioned by Jeremy.   WILD MUSHROOM PAPPARDELLE ($16)- This pasta gave me life. They use a lot of truffle oil in this dish and it pairs really well with the mushrooms and parmesan slices. The pappardelle pasta is cooked to a perfect al dente and topped with fresh basil throughout.   I enjoyed every second of my meal and my experience with Jeremy and would 100000% come back next time I visit Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times. It's in a convenient location where you can get soem shopping done or grab a drink in Old Town after. The restaurant has a good vibe; great modern decor. The wait staff and hosts/hostesses are incredibly attentive. Bonus: they are crazy good looking too. The last time I ate here, I was with 4 other girls. One of my friends broke her sandal and I asked the host if we could have some tape. Bonus points to him for giving us Velcro. We had an Open Table rezzie so we were seated right away in the dining room. I will have to ask to sit outside next time when it cools down...  We ordered much needed wine and cocktails and started off with the bruschetta. It was super tasty, seasoned perfectly and was great to share with the girls. The girls ordered shrimp and grits and salads and other dishes I can't remember off the top of my head but I went with the scallops. Moral of the story: great, fresh food and at a decent price. I didn't have room for dessert but we ordered gelato for the table. The waiter messed up on the number of scoops but that was the only thing that went wrong. Everyone cleaned their plates and was swooning over their meals. I think on the weekends they have a DJ right in the entrance, the music was actually pretty good but not sure if it fits with the crowd. There were very few people/tables who were our age (mid 20's) If you're in OT, check this place out."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have only eaten here once but it was very fulfilling of my expectations. The place is very classy and a little bit too fancy for the area but besides that the food was amazing. I thought it was a little weird that they were serving brunch at 2 in the afternoon on a Sunday but it definitely changed my thought on that when my food came. I got the egg sandwich and it was to die for! Perfect size and getting the side of potatoes was definitely a good choice. I definitely would love to go back and try what they have to offer on their lunch menu!"}
{"text":"Lovely spot to grab a quick meal or some of their delicious coffee. Olive and Ivy is a great comfortable place to hang out as it is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Their pastries and gelato are also to die for."}
{"text":"Great food. Tuna sandwich is delicious. Food just seems to vary in portions depending on who prepares i guess. Sometimes I've had a side that came with literally 12 french fries and then sometimes they overload the container. Service is always quick and friendly!!"}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy is a great place as a venue inside and outside. Over the years they have slowly raised their prices on food items but it is still a great place none the less. I personally think they have a better lunch menu than dinner menu but you can just decide that for yourself. The turkey grinder and chicken panini are my favorite. On weekends get a drink from their brunch menu."}
{"text":"Wow really bad service.  Food was good though.  Their turkey grinder with greens is excellent. Our waiter brought our drinks (finally) when our lunch was half eaten.  Most people like to have their wine before the meal.  Really crappy service all the way around.  And it was embarrassing as I was taking someone for lunch. Booooooo!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends. Service was great and the food was outstanding. Great bread and pesto to start. I had the sweet potato cannelloni which was exquisite. The waiter suggested adding a protein. I added shrimp, a great choice. The other guests had Mediterranean salad, bacon wrapped pork and chicken scalloping. Everyone raves. Can't wait to go back. Prices were very reasonable, too."}
{"text":"[RESERVATION] I had been meaning to go here for a while. However, when I came with my parents for dinner, the hostess told us the restaurant would have an opening two hours later. When I came here with friends, some time later, they told us the same thing. Long story short, you should make a reservation. I was able to get a table for a Sunday night when I called two days before having dinner with my family.  I don't think the Olive and Ivy sign does the restaurant justice, because it makes it seem like the usual casual, chain restaurant. However, the inside is great (just a tad too dimly lit). There are jars with lights in them hanging down from the ceiling and a view of the river(?)/creek next to the restaurant. It is kind of loud as well.  [APPETIZERS] We were served complimentary homemade focaccia bread and pesto sauce. For appetizers, we ordered \"Choose 3 for $11\" bruschetta and Kale Salad [$11]. The butternut squash was my favorite. The prosciutto and fig was also very good. The amount that they give you for the salad is pretty filling. I think this is good to share because I feel like I would become bored with it if I just ordered that for myself.  [ENTREES] The Prosciutto and Marscarpone Tortelli [$16] doesn't look well put together. I was actually disappointed by the presentation when it first came out because it doesn't look like it will taste good. However, it tastes amazing. The sauce used in this dish is great to dip bread in.  My brother ordered the Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin [$24], which was amazing. I don't usually order pork because I fear it will be tough and not flavorful, but the bacon definitely was a great addition. I don't know what they did to the brussels sprouts but whatever bad taste they left in your mouth the last time you decided to give them a chance will go away once you try these.   Shrimp Risotto [$25] was good - my dad really liked it. I'm just not much of a risotto person - I think that's what I'm starting to realize about myself. But if risotto is what you like, then you won't be dissatisfied.   My mom ordered the Pacific Sea Bass (I think). I thought the presentation for this was well done.  [DESSERTS] Desserts I would suggest that you get elsewhere. I mean, they were okay, but nothing amazing. We ordered the bread pudding(?) that comes with a scoop of ice cream and lemon blueberry cake."}
{"text":"If you are in this area and hungry for Seafood, go to Wildfish.  If you are hungry for anything else, come here.  My wife and I walked by here many times, but were never hungry.  We went to Scottsdale for some Cactus convention, and made it a point to stop here this time.  We ate outside on the patio, with the misters going.  I had the Natural Chicken or something like that, and it was amazing.  Chicken breast with the skin left on, over mashed potatoes.....with a mushroom sauce that is a bit misleading.  Says it is Citrus Jus, and since I am not a citrus sauce fan, told the waiter no sauce.  He suggested I get it on the side, so I did.  I tried it, and it MADE the dish.  No citrus flavor at all, very sweet like PF Chang's Mongolian sauce.  My wife got the Mushroom Pasta dish, and loved it.  Over all, one of my favorite places to go in Scottsdale.  Yelp, what is with the \"gender neutral\" restroom question?   Please!  Who gives a sh!t?  Restrooms have been pretty basic for centuries, look down, then use appropriate restroom!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, beautiful location. Don't miss this place! The sangria is amazing."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at this restaurant with my wife.  Our waiter recommended the shrimp scampi risotto because that is  the favorite dish of the managers and chefs.  I totally agree - it was phenomenal. My wife had the chicken scaloppini based on his recommendation and that did not disappoint either.  Highly recommend both dishes.  My wife is gluten free and they had a number of dishes to choose from."}
{"text":"Very nice lunch spot. I go here quite often. Whether its with my friends, or family, this place has always been extremely consistent and I know exactly what I am going to get. Great food, great service. As with most of the Fox Concepts, they don't disappoint. The Sea bass is amazing! We have had many dishes here including the pastrami sandwich, various pastas, and raviolis. All of which are great. The setting is very well constructed, and allows for a nice ambiance. This place caters to a wide variety of people, which allows for a setting of all occasions."}
{"text":"Just had lamb gyro tasted like burnt patties. Very dissatisfied. I usually love  the restaurant."}
{"text":"We missed the happy hour but the dinner was great!! We had bacon wrapped dates to start. It was tasty and interesting combination but too much for two people(5 bacon wrapped dates per order). I got pacific sea bass w/caramelized cauliflower, snap peas & preserved grapefruit. That was wonderful. I could lick the plate if it possible. I like the sea bass is crispy and tender. The grapefruit works so well with the plate. The sauce is also amazing. My boyfriend got spicy shrimp risotto w/white zucchini, arbol chili & lemon. There are tons of shrimp and the risotto taste wonderful as well. We had guava sorbet as dessert. For the price I think it is the cheapest sorbet I had in the restaurant. It taste good and real!! I wish I had a chance to visit Olive & Ivy again."}
{"text":"Like Minneapolis & St. Paul. Like Cagney & Lacey. Like Nip & Tuck. Olive & Ivy is beautiful and near some water, entertaining and lesbian friendly and full of people who've had plastic surgery. Great space. Fabulous patio. I know. I know. The canal. Ugh. Love it? Hate it? Hey, it's there people. Embrace it! Like the Brady's did cousin Oliver.  And embrace the Eggs Benedict, Egg Sandwich, Focacciao bread with pesto and CENTER CUT CINNAMON ROLLS! You heard me people! Center cut. No non glazed, hardened, corner piece. Service was outstanding. I noticed the patio filled up just after we arrived. Isn't that weird? Does that ever happen to you? You arrive somewhere. Nothing. Soon the place is buzzing and so are you? Anyway. I digress. We were thirsty fashionistas recovering after a night at Scottsdale Fashion Week...i.e. we were pickled and thirsty. Ice tea and water was a flowin' the entire meal. They saw it in our blood shot eyes I'm sure. Eggs Benedict was perfection and had a delightful surprise of basil on top! Rickie LOVED his egg sandwich with avocado...looked great...though he never offered me any...Hmmm..Olive & Ivy. Like Ebony & Ivory. Living together in perfect harmony. Side by side....ok ok ok you get the picture."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere and energy at Olive and Ivy. I love going there for drinks and appetizers. The one at the waterfront is beautiful and the large patio is next to the water. Service is friendly. If you have a private party you can reserve the party room (which is beautiful). The Sangria is one of my favorite drinks. Try it with a couple of appetizers!"}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to go to Olive and Ivy's happy hour on Friday. It was a warm day but we still sat on the patio and it was perfect with the misters and shaded trees. They offer great HH prices half off sangria pitchers, apps, flat breads and signature cocktails. We ordered the red sangria and it was delicious. We liked how it wasn't jammed full with chunks of fruit we felt we got more for our money. We ordered the antipasti plate that we were pleased with as well as the artichoke hearts. This was served with a salad that I thought was a nice touch. The service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! We opted for the outdoor seating on the patio for lunch which was perfect. The seating is very comfortable and casual and included a fire pit. My mom and I ordered the avocado, mozzarella, and mushroom bruschettas. The mozzarella was my favorite out of the bunch. We also got the hummus appetizer which was good but kind of spicy. The braised short rib flatbread was the best part of the meal. Overall friendly service, lovely atmosphere, and great food. Definitely a must to visit in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"There's something about Olive & Ivy that makes me want to go back. Sadly, its not the food, as much as I wish it was. Yet, I go back. [Sometimes, it is for food. Those lamb meatballs are not meant for sharing. Take my advice and there will be peace at the table.]  Where else can you sip on 5$ mimosas, on a balmy Saturday afternoon, in a Mediterranean inspired well manicured backyard? The setting takes you miles away from the brown overloaded Arizona. The ambience and service more than make up for the 'just a notch above mediocre' food. I particularly like taking the unreserved lounge seating and linger around for longer than they may like!  At some places, the food just takes a backseat. Here, it's for a good reason."}
{"text":"The food is very good for the style of restaurant (some hot food & sandwiches at a counter) and they've got good options. But the staff is what made all the difference. I was delayed for a long layover and ended up sitting there for the better part of 4 hours. They not only didn't complain that I was taking up a seat, but continually brought me fresh water & lemon, even before dinner time hit and I ordered my turkey pesto. They went out of their way to make sure I was taken care of."}
{"text":"What's the most important piece for your decision at an airport on where to eat? Time.  I give it a 4 because the line moves pretty quickly and the people were cordial.  Food quality is pretty decent. Price is a little ridiculous, but hey all airports are.  Bacon eggs toast and home style potatoes were $9. My iced coffee was another $2.   They have a lot of choices for lunch for sandwiches, and they seem to make everything fresh. Plenty of seats."}
{"text":"Walked into this place on a Saturday night (i am from out of town) with my 4 girl friends...this place is HUGE!   Very packed and loud but in a fun way.  Love the decor and ambiance. Huge bar in the middle with a nice wine list and a variety of drink options. The wait was a little annoying, as we had reservations and still had to wait about 40 minutes. The menu had some vegetarian options, not a whole lot, but what i ate was really good.  The vegetable Crostini appetizer was amazing and the Hummus was not that bad either. I had the margarita pizza which was good, my friends had a pasta with chicken and they loved it as well. The sangria we had was ok, I've had better in Chicago.  The crowd was upbeat and lively, seemed to have quite a few out of towners as well, and the age ranged anywhere from college to seniors...price wise it wasn't the cheapest place but it won't rip a hole in your pocket either."}
{"text":"Fun chic atmosphere.  Great patio.  Food is consistent and good.  Pastas are wonderful."}
{"text":"Anyway, we arrived and without reservation we were seated immediately. Everything about our dining experience was excellent. Our waitress was awesome. It was my lovahs 30th bday dinner and she went above and beyond and even offered to take pics for us when she saw me struggling to do a photo shoot myself. We picked a trio of bruschetta and they were alllll delish! My honey got the sweet potato ravioli and omigod i couldn't stop opening my mouth so he would feed me another bite. I had the risotto which was good but his ravioli was just downright fantastic! We had champagne and they come in cute flutes and also a bday dessert with a candle on the house!!!   The ambiance here is great... good music and lighting. We will be back. I def def def recommend! (no stuttering prob, just expressing you should DEF try it out ) :)"}
{"text":"Just happened upon this place while traveling to Arizona to visit my parents.  Wow!  The ambiance is great and the food is even better.  We started with the bacon wrapped date small plate which was one of the most delicious tasting things I have \"ever\" eaten.  I highly highly recommend ordering this item, you won't  be disappointed.  We followed this with the kale salad and the funghi trifolati flatbread, both of which were made of very fresh ingredients, many of which were organic.  I will definitely be back here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The food and service are always amazing. The Sunday champagne brunch is great. The morning coffee/breakfast bar is quick and delicious."}
{"text":"Three stars for service. Thereafter, the food is average at best.  We split a flatbread pizza and garden salad.  There was so much grease it puddled and we literally needed paper towels to sop it up.  Additionally, the garden salad's lettuce was very limp and unappetizing.  Most of the food was still on plates when we exited. With so many epic restaurants in town, I recommend not immediately choosing the most recognized establishments...."}
{"text":"I came here during my stay in Scottsdale for work on a Sunday night. It happened to coincide with Spring Training so I was told that all the restaurants were much busier than usual. This is probably the reason that despite the many empty tables both inside and outside (they were all filled by the time I left), I was told there was only availability for one at the bar or area in front of the kitchen. I opted for the kitchen area and got to watch the cooks at work during my dinner.   The atmosphere is very chic, but the patrons were a eclectic mix of retirees, families and young partiers. The concept is Mediterranean, although I didn't see any traditionally Mediterranean dishes on the menu. The menu is pretty sizable with a variety of pasta, fish, and meats to select from, with vegetarian and gluten-free options marked.    FOOD: PROSCIUTTO CRUDO FLATBREAD (topped with rosemary potato and soft egg) - When I ordered this, I didn't realize the portion was supposed to be shared so it ended up being way too much for me. If I had just one slice, it would've been great, but it got tiring after my third slice.  BIG EYE TUNA (with charred scallions, snap peas, couscous & miso caramel) - I'm a sucker for couscous! I always order it when I see it on the menu so this selection was a no-brainer. The couscous and the snap peas did not disappoint. The Ahi Tuna was sesame seed crusted and was fine, but not mind-blowing. I wish it were marinated more to give it extra flavor.   The reason I rated this as 3 stars is simply because while the food was good, nothing was that impressive, especially for the price. Maybe if I came back and tried a few more items and drinks I would change my mind, but for now, this is just an OK restaurant.  I would still recommend this restaurants for groups because I think their outside patio area is lovely. The menu is also diverse and safe enough that everyone should be able to find something they enjoy. However, definitely make a reservation, otherwise you'll be stuck at the bar like me!"}
{"text":"Very cool place! Our party of 4 sat outside. What a terrific outdoor space they have there. The inside was just as lovely. Really cool decor with incredible lighting. The service was impeccable too. All the food was delicious, although the portions were a bit small for the price. Two of us had seafood, and the other two had pasta. We had enjoyed some wine and cheese before coming here so we didn't order any appetizers. We saw someone else with the bruschetta trio and it looked really good. We definitely plan to return on our next visit to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We came here as part of our celebrating 40 years together. This place is really nice. The decor and lighting promises a romantic and relaxed experience. The menu pleasantly surprises with items not commonly found. We are warmly welcomed and promptly seated in a high backed booth that allows for privacy. I've given 5 stars and here is why. I got the veal and spinach ravioli. It comes and the presentation is beautiful. Then I take a bite and it is cold. First in a restaurant of this caliber cold food should never leave the kitchen. But more importantly how the restaurant handles things when mistakes are made. And this is why despite getting cold food I am still giving 5 stars. The manager immediately apologized, told me they would not reheat it, but will remake the dish for me so it would be fresh. My dish comes back piping hot, beautifully presented, and the taste was worth amazing. And then the manager told me my meal was on the house. And that is exactly how this should have been handled. No excuses, make it right. And on top of this, when I made the reservation I had indicated it was our 40th Anniversary. The brought us an on the house dessert to share that was so beautifully presented, and again the taste was amazing. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Excellent tasty food. Outside patio atmosphere under the lights was perfect. Took Yelp reviews to heart and gave it a try. Will definitely go back. Many times."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC SERVICE!!! They ran out of Sam Adams. Robert went to get me a draft Sam Adams next door! Who does that?!?! A++++ service!"}
{"text":"While my buddy Mike Z. was in town, we hit a few high spots...by which I could mean that we were high when we hit them...so munchies:)  But, no...my drug of choice is KetelOne or Bunnahabhain these days:)  One of the high spots was the fabulous Scottsdale Waterfront and Olive and Ivy:)  Of all the things that you can say about the Scottsdale Waterfront the most accurate is that it is, indeed, on the water:)  I grew up in the northwest and then lived in San Francisco for many years...I've dined overlooking the Mighty Columbia, the Mighty Pacific, The Mighty Willamette.  While traveling, I've managed to sup while overlooking the Mighty North Sea, the Mighty Atlantic and the Mighty Mississippi.  I'm probably not a good one to ask about the waterfront appeal of the Mighty Arizona Canal:)  Never the less, Olive and Ivy is a nice enough place:)  It's another Fox Concept (don't you just love the branding and labeling of these kinds of things:)  I suppose it would just be too darn simple to just say \"Hey, look!...Sam Fox just opened a new place!:)...Yay!\"...or something like that...no, it's a \"concept\"...and if you know me at all (and most of you don't) you know that restaurant nomenclature is nearly a complete mystery to me.  Fox Concept is no exception (oh, I get the \"Olive and Ivy\"...it's sort of Mediterranean, with a what...California overbite?:)...is that a concept?  I any event, The Beautiful Carin, Mike and I strolled over for cocktails and dinner, stayed for desert, sat out on the patio (which is very pleasant, BTW:)  And we enjoyed ourselves!  Well, why not...it was an enjoyable evening...pleasant atmosphere... the service was very good (I sometimes wonder if my reputation as a stupid good tipper is being spread around town...I seem to get great service even in places that don't really have a reputation for good service...I don't know...maybe it's just a coincidence:)  At any rate...the concept was hoppin'!:-)  Ton's of terrific people watching...people dining, people strolling along the Mighty Arizona Canal, people doing the hook up dance in the bar...dinner and a show...what a concept! :-)  We each had a couple of marti's (oh, the joys of being able to walk to dinner!:)  We started with a hummus something appetizer and antipasti...The Beautiful Carin and I split a perfectly serviceable Caesar salad and I had a nice risotto, while Carin ordered her standby...roasted chicken (I wish I could remember what Mikey ordered, but I was too busy with my marti's, chit chat and what not:)  After dinner, desert seemed like a reasonable idea:)  Mike and I each had a Porto, while we all shared something chocolate and another something kind of cinnamon and orange...  It was all pretty good, not the best risotto, but good...actually, not the best anything, but still good...all pretty well executed (if not truly inspired)  If Fox's Concept is separating me from my money on a fairly regular basis, then I guess it's a successful concept:)"}
{"text":"Another Fox concept success. Tried it and really enjoyed everything about it. The service, the food, and especially the outside seating area. Just a beautiful place to go chill."}
{"text":"Having been back a second time, I can't say i understand why this is so highly rated. While I get that the ambiance is cool, the food was relatively mediocre and greasy. Also, it took over 30 minutes for us to get any dishes. Definitely not acceptance during a weekday lunch. Crossing this one off my list to revisit."}
{"text":"We celebrated my cousin's bachelorette lingerie shower in the gold room last weekend and it was such a great experience! Since none of us were from the area, it was so nice to have a long, private dinner. Our server MA (Mark Anthony) was great! He was personable, fun, and really knew the menu (we kind of tested him on the menu!) The food was fresh and delicious, and the ambiance was perfect for a great girls night. The manager came in a few times to check on us and thank us, and even brought us a round of shots to get the night started. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area or traveling to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"My second or third time going to this restaurant first time was mediocre the second time was my birthday and I had an amazing time just because the staff treated me and my guest with utmost respect and we got the room in the back so we had a really good time. So this last time we were just there this past Saturday night for dinner and I can say I was server John was perfect. Because I am vegan vegetarian there was nothing on the menu that I could have eaten so he suggested a alternative dinner option and I got the Catalonia(sp). It was very very tasty and for dessert I had the sorbet. Everyone said the food was OK however the choices for dinner could have been much better. Everyone came to the consensus that the brunch menu is way better than that dinner menu. I just wish that the restaurant would be able to have better options for groups of parties I understand it's easier to have one menu or two menus but if I am going to be paying 50 or $60 I think the food choices and the servings should be just a little bit better tasting.   All in all I will be back but not for dinner most likely just back for brunch!"}
{"text":"Somewhere between a 3.5-4   We tried to find Aye Caramba with another GPS fail and in frustration I just drove to the Fiesta Bowl Museum so at least my plus one could get to see his football stuff..... fail (again) turned into a positive. We went in for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised.   My egg sandwich was yummy. They said Kaiser roll but what I got was something soft and delicious (similar to Matt's Big Breakfast's Five Spot). Eggs were well done, avocado was fresh, cheese was yummy and the highlight was the potatoes. The potatoes were crispy outside soft inside and decently seasoned. It was a lot of food for 7.50. Boyfriend got the 2 eggs and he was happy. While we were waiting for our food we caught sight of the french toast.. it smelled like cinnamon and sugar and they were three large thick slices along side some berry compote....next time.. next time...   Liked the decor (we sat near the wine cellar wall) and our food came within 10 minutes.    In looking at the reviews maybe breffix (breakfast) is a better option than lunch."}
{"text":"I note with interest that Olive and Ivy appears to advertise on Yelp, and also that numerous negative reviews have been buried by Yelp in the \"Not Recommended\" section.  Coincidence?  Who knows.  We'll see where this review ends up...  In short, this restaurant's location is terrific--in a vibrant spot on the Scottsdale waterfront, perfect for strolling and window-shopping before or after dinner.  Food is so-so.  Restaurant is very loud.  Service is horrible: we were seated at 6:30 and when I finally left at 8:45 my entree had not yet been served.  On a related note, the valet service doesn't use paper check tickets, they use an app which requires you to provide your cell phone number to them, and which appears to slow them down considerably because it's difficult for them to use.  Retrieving my car took about 15 minutes even though there was only one person ahead of me."}
{"text":"During the spring and fall in Phoenix, I'm a huge fan of Olive & Ivy. You can't beat their patio - its first come, first served on huge, comfortable furniture along with fire pits. The areas are nicely divided and its absolutely perfect for large groups. Sometimes the stench of the \"waterfront\" aka canal can creep up on you, but its usually fine.   What to order? I typically don't get dinner, but like to share small plates like the flatbread with my party. The sangria, margaritas and wine are all really good. Oh - and if they don't just automatially bring it over, but sure to ask for the bread and pesto. Delish!"}
{"text":"We visited Olive & Ivy while we were on vacation for a long weekend in Scottsdale, and it was hands down the best meal we had.  We were seated promptly when we arrived (we had a reservation) and our server was awesome- knowledgeable, informative and not overbearing.  The ambiance was great, sort of trendy/modern.  The space is large and the tables are spaced nicely, making it a nice date night spot.  The food was really great.  We had the hummus for an appetizer, which was amazing and had just the right amount of garlic.  For entrees I had the scallopes and he had the bacon wrapped pork tenderlion, both of which were supurb.  Dinner was a little pricey, but for the great quality of food and service I'd say that it was worth it.  If we visit Scottsdale again we will definitely return to Olive & Ivy."}
{"text":"Two words, the ones to influence you when making your decision: Thoroughly. Delicious.   Moving on to the specifics, highlights include:  Mushroom asparagus flat bread: Seriously beyond the beyond. Shaved bits of parmesan, melted mozzarella, asparagus tips, mushroom pieces and *deep breath* drizzled with blessed truffle oil.   Market salad: fresher than fresh bitter greens, candied citrus peels, balsamic vinaigrette. The market salad is not an every day option, but really damn good so if this is offered on the day you go, get it as a side to make you feel less guilty about eating all the bready wonders in this place (more to come!)  Sangria: True grown up grape juice. Maybe *too* much homage to Welch's.    Hummus: Good. Possibly great. But the aforementioned flat bread eclipsed the shit out of it. I broke my usual rule to only order hummus in straight-up Middle Eastern restaurants. If the hummus is the only veg option in a place, fine, but there are plenty at Olive & Ivy (read: get the damn flat bread!)  And then there's the bread that comes out before everything else. Almost focaccia, but of a less heavy texture, these slices of heavenly gluten come with a pesto dipping sauce.  Note: do not come here if you're god forbid trying to avoid carbs. Not that this is me.  Environs: oozes atmosphere, whether you dine out on the patio or the high ceiling dining room (check out the opulent private dining room which is enclosed in glass, just waiting for wannabe Prince Williams and Kate Middletons. Or even wannabe Gene Simmons and Shannon Tweeds).   Special shout-out to our \"darling\" (as Jeffrey H puts it) waitress."}
{"text":"Bruschetta (salmon lox, avocado, prosciutto choices) tasted amazing - seasoned great. Also great we're the Mediterranean salad and chopped chicken salad. Larsen was our excellent server. Great view, people watching near the Soleri Bridge."}
{"text":"If you find yourself wondering what this place reminds you of, think no more - it is a glorified Cheesecake Factory.  The ambience is Willy Wonka meets Alice in Wonderland with the super high ceilings, geometric decor and frankly, a color scheme that needs to be muted down a notch or two.    The bartenders are obviously swamped so they are sloppy with their cocktail creations, with luxardo cherries carelessly dropped into my old-fashioned drink, waiting to be diluted by the generic ice cubes that overflowed from the glass.    Frito misto and lamb meatballs sounded like heaven but when the plates arrived, the frito misto looked like sad calamari rejects from Olive Garden.  Not sure what proportion of the meatballs were actually lamb but they sure resembled the factory-made ones they sample at Costco.    Now I'm not some grumpy old fart but what's with the loud music being blasted by the DJ awkwardly positioned by the door? Such a weird vibe in a weird space- it was all so disappointing..."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I both started of with the eighteen dollar margaritas(which are actually $11-though they would be $18 in California for how strong they were). Then we had the bruschetta sampler appetizer, which was enough to be a meal. The ambiance was far nicer than the mall setting would seem to allow. And our server, Alyssa was prompt with getting our order, bringing our food, and guiding us toward more optimal options. I wish she would wait and on us every time. All in all it was a great place to dine out in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"what's the point of this place? Besides the little hipster drink shop, the food i dont think is very impressive, what's the appeal? the location? I don;t get it, maybe im missing something but i remember never wanting to go sit down there again, i just swing in for a kombucha if my chakras are balanced."}
{"text":"I want to fly to Phoenix airport every week just to eat their pizza. So...SO...SOOOOO good!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Fox Restaurants and an Old Town staple for me and my friends.  They have amazing pesto and bread that is served complimentary with every meal.  The Ivy and Ginger cocktail is refreshing and not too sweet.  For breakfast, the cinnamon roll is amazing and so is the sausage sandwich.  For lunch, I reccomend the chicken pesto flatbread and, for dinner, I reccomend the Sweet Potato Cannelloni. They also have the most amazing Oreo Cheesecake Gelato."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  We had the Shrimp Rissotto... A must have!  The Mediterranean salad with Shrimp and the cheese and mushroom flat bread.  The service was top class.  I will return!"}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy sounds cool because in SD we have \"Juniper & Ivy^ and it's a super cool spot, so we were hoping Olive & Ivy was super cool too... turned out the name wasn't lying!  We couldn't decide were to go for brunch so I yelped \"bloody mary\" and O&I came up so being alcoholics we needed our morning fix...well by the time we woke up and came here it was noon. We were able to make resos through opentable and got seated really quickly. Upon being seated we were greeted by our server and ordered drinks- Bloody Mary & Gin Greyhound.   Bloody Mary- good mix to it, it wasn't watery. Garnish was a bit bare, but my second one they stepped up the garnish game (olives, lemon & celery). I love BMs were  you can get a lot of garnishes. My friend hates gin, but he said that was one of the best grey hounds! You can't even taste the gin. They were pretty generous on the alcohol portion as we left with a great buzz.   Now on to the food! The house bread that came with pesto dipping sauce made it all better. I love bread with good dipping sauce. Plus one for that! I couldn't decide if I wanted breakfast or lunch as now it's noonish and it's already really hot in Scottsdale. So my friend and I decided to order lunch portions and split it. We got the prosciutto flatbread and the lamb gyro. I'm glad we got both because O&I is mediterranean and it didn't disappoint. The highlight was the prosciutto crudo flatbread with an egg on top. They also had basil and rosemary potatoes on the flatbread. It was soo good and portions were generous. We were able to take half the flatbread back and ate it a few hours later and it still tasted good!  *Side note: One of the bartenders looked like Manny Pacquiao,,,and we came on the fight weekend. We really wanted to go up to him and say \"hey you're going to be late for your fight\" but I'm sure he gets shit from everybody that weekend."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant!, unbelievably delicious bacon wrapped dates for appetizer!!!! Only problem was distracted service.... having to ask for water refills etc and it is pretty expensive, particularly for a very large restaurant that is part of a chain. We will check it out again though!"}
{"text":"Probably not going to be a popular review but here goes. Went in Sunday for lunch and sat at the bar. The place is very loud. The bartenders were responsive but to say they were stiff would be an understatement. The food was good but pricey and I asked them to skip the couscous on my salad and did not remove it. To be fair I think this place is a hipsters dream with the vested pretentious bartenders and the Bellinis and other fancy drinks. If that is your scene you will love this place but it is just not our speed."}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy is everything a brunch spot should be.   Elegant, relaxed, refined, and outdoorsy. Brunch in the outdoors is just a necessity!  The BF and I got a late start on our Saturday. We became Scottsdale wanderers and became lost in the shiny retail-roads of old town.   Eventually we found our way to the canal, only made obvious by my recent Yelp excursion to a nearby eatery.   We took in the noon-time sights: art, people, etc. I perused Yelp for a decent late lunch and O&I was top of the list. With the gorgeous canal views I can see how it would be!  We ventured near and requested an outdoor table. Unfortunately our table was Also a favorite hangout for a local bird (apparently a protected bird). My BF and the bird became instAnt mates - much to his dismay. A few encounters later we were ushered to another table. FYI we named the bird Pippy (aka Poopy).   The views and weather were fantastic. Roughly 75* and breezy we could not have asked for better weather. The art installation at the canal made for an even better view.   Our cocktails were fantastic. A Fig mule for me and a apple/jalapeño margarita for him. With just the right blend of flavors and alcohol we were pleased. Plus the price was right (or maybe that's our SoCalroots showing).   I had the salad - which after reading a local CM's review I wish I would have ordered the warm chicken. The BF has the Tuna sandwich, which was a tad lackluster.   My salad had hefty amounts of bleu cheese which is always appreciated, but I do wish the choice of warm chicken versus cold was made more apparent.   We also ordered desert - lemon pudding cake. I found myself enjoying it, however not loving it. I did, however enjoy my fresh espresso - even thought it was received after we had finished dessert. Graciously, the server removed the espresso from the bill. Thank you for that!   I would not hesitate to visit O&I again as the atmosphere and service are five stars in itself."}
{"text":"It took forever to get a seat, even though only about 1/3rd of the tables had guests. Our server had a terrible attitude and appeared agitated that she was working. Also, the table next to us got piled up on several occasions with dirty dishes. Just disgusting, and overpriced."}
{"text":"Had helpful hosts even though we had no reservation on a busy Sunday brunch and got seated at a nice table by the window with my friend who was amazed by this gem and the interior design. Drinks, food, service was all 10/10"}
{"text":"I took my wife on a date and it was well worth everything. We had fun at the bar, the service was perfect and the food was the best. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and I LOVED IT!! It's my favorite restaurant for now on, and also we did received the best service our waiter was TOMMY he is amazing !!!! Ask for him"}
{"text":"This restaurant was my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. I can't believe I never reviewed it when I lived in Arizona. Yum. I miss this place."}
{"text":"This place left quite an impression on me, I have to say.  First, the waiter (forgive me for not remembering his name) was refreshingly eloquent. He explained the menu item-by item in the the most intricate and juicy detail. Actual quotes: \"I personally recommend the ice cream bar. I dream about this dessert when I sleep at night and I have to beg the chef to make it for me the next day. Creamy, indulging, satisfying\" After his 5-minute spiel, our table was already sold on every item he listed. He wasn't just a waiter; he was a poet.  The appetizers were particularly good, with the bacon-wrapped dates taking the gold for the most creative and delicious plate. The pesto here is great; make sure to request some with your bread. Also consider the beet salad, which was my favorite among the greens.  I had the natural chicken as my entree and while it sounds like a very basic dish, I enjoyed every bite of it. The chicken was moist and slightly tangy while the yukon puree adorned the sides of the plate.   Finally, the ice cream bar ended the feast on a perfect note. It is served with a steak knife so you can carve out your bite from the log of rich deep chocolate+toffee ice cream  Distinguishing factor: this place takes the bacon-wrapping trend to a new level with the bacon-wrapped dates. The plate was the star of our table."}
{"text":"This is definitely a five star review. Reservations were smooth, check in easy. We were seated promptly and when asked at the last minute to sit outside, they were very nice about it. The ambiance is a bit dark inside, and slightly noisy, but very warmly decorated with a great atmosphere to it. Outdoor seating is a must as long as it has cooled some, which it had. It was just perfect. The patio is decorated very lovely, cozy, and it's spacious, great for groups, and there are misters.  A must try are: The prosciutto and fig appetizer The sea bass entree, light and creamy  The salmon, cooked perfectly and seasoned with this delicious honey like glaze and beats, yum! I was five seconds away from ordering a second salmon entree it was just that great The desserts, amazing! A must try: The toasted coconut cakes with mint chocolate chip ice cream Their blackberry balsamic ice cream amazing! All fish made.  If you come to Scottsdale you cannot leave without stopping by for dinner. Trust me it's a winner!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I eat lunch here at least one to two times a week. The food is always great, the atmosphere is comfortable, and the staff is incredibly friendly. This is seriously the best patio in Scottsdale for day eating & drinking. The only reason I gave O&I 4/5 stars is because the service is consistently slow. They feature a full-dining side and a market side where you can get anything & everything to go, including lattes and smoothies. Agan, great service on either side of the restaurant, but the full dining portion is rather slow."}
{"text":"I come here for the atmosphere and food, but the service brings me back.  One of the coolest things about this place is that you can pick an open seat in front--no waiting, sink into their soft leather chairs--and people watch.      The food is prepared with such detail and care.  I ordered a vegetable cheese soup and it was perfectly seasoned.  My salad was fresh with a tangy oil and vinegar dressing...Wow! what a taste.  My companion had the fresh salmon.  Served over a bed of lettuce, the taste and presentation was just terrific!!    The breads served here really satisfy.  And the dipping sauce has just the right amount of garlic and spice to keep you nibbling throughout the meal.    But what makes the difference at this eatery is their unmatched service.  Everyone is friendly and professional.  The wait staff are trained like no other.  Ask them what is in the pesto sauce and the rattle off about 10 different ingredients.    What pleasure early weekend breakast is at this place.  You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Great atmosphere and service.  The bacon wrapped dates were fabulous.  Highly recommend this place!!"}

{"text":"Bread please! I love this place for anytime of the day! We come here about twice a week and I haven't had anything bad! Brunch is great! Lunch & dinner I love the chicken granola salad! Make sure to ask for extra granola and to have the chicken grilled. You'll thank me later! The complimentary bread and pesto sauce is brilliant! It's worth the calories!!!!!!!! Service is always great. I personally love the outdoor seating and misters. Also make sure to sign up online you get a free meal on your birthday & $10 credit toward your email just for signing up. Also to note, happy hour is super cheap! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here at the recommendation of a friend and was very, very pleased with the entire experience. From our hilarious, accommodating waiter to the beyond-delicious food (I had an appetizer of bacon wrapped dates and the rare seared tuna) I would return here in a heart beat. They also presented me with a beautiful desert for my birthday, complete with a glowing candle and fancy \"happy birthday\" spelled in something edible, but without the embarrassing waiter-ensemble happy birthday serenade. Anxious to return as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"Olive and ivy is a cute and fancy place to go eat! If you don't have a reservation, beware because you might have to sit outside or wait a bit. We sat outside on the patio area (had misters and umbrellas) that was great. I had the two eggs any style, which was good. Also, $5 mimosas on Saturday!!"}
{"text":"Next to the river. Inside and outside dining. Trees outside. Very interesting decor. Friendly staff. Noisy. Interesting selection of starters. Dessert menu pretty ordinary. 25 bucks for 4 scallops on a small puddle of polenta is not a price performer. Was told later it is a famous \"pick up spot\". Could be. Seemed pretty popular. Would go again for a glass of wine and perhaps bruschetta selection. Not for a meal. Have been to better places for food including one at the Sky Harbor airport. Have a favorite in Tempe which I will not mention. Don't want to have to wait in line."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous restaurant.  We were 10 minutes late for our reservation, but the staff was really friendly and accommodating and made us feel comfortable.  Our waiter was engaging and fun.  The entire kitchen is open to the inside seating area, which was awesome to watch.  We sat outside on the patio which I highly recommend; it's right on the canal and it was fun to watch the giant \"waterbugs\" on the river change colors throughout the evening.  If you're going to order cocktails, I suggest the Daiquiri No. 4.  The waiter suggested a locally brewed beer for my husband and we both thought it was one of the best beers we'd ever tasted.  Now for the food:  I ordered the sea scallops, which were possibly the best I'd ever had.  My husband had the chicken entree, which was good, not great.  For dessert we shared the peanut butter pudding, which was to die for, and the Napoleon ice cream sandwich, which was just fine.  The only reason I'm not giving this a five-star review is because this restaurant is LOUD.  It's surprisingly big and it was completely packed when we were there, which was a Monday night, so I definitely wouldn't go there on a weekend!  It's definitely not the place for a chill, family meal.  But for a nicer, trendier date night, it's an awesome choice.  If I'm ever back in the Scottsdale area, I will definitely try to get in here again!"}
{"text":"The most specialist place I love to go to  it was our first date we had the same server for two years and she left we were so sad but love it no matter what the menu changes upon season which is cool even tho I only order the same thing lol"}
{"text":"Since my last visit to Arizona I've come to accept there are some truly exceptional restaurants in this desert state. Going to one of the wealthier areas of Arizona, Olive & Ivy is located next to a river and features a luxurious interior of velvet, wood, and spirits. From the moment you walk in you feel like this is going to be a special evening.   Interior - 5 stars Olive & Ivy has this beautiful, romantic mood at night. The lights are low and the shadows seep into the wood work. Homages to the old style of tungsten light bulbs hang from above while plush curtains drape from ceiling to floor. The style is open and wide, allowing light to come shine from the outside and having both outdoor and indoor seating connect with no walls to be a border. The kitchen is large and open letting anyone see the beauty of their art and the giant bar located near the entrance wraps around to the back where the gelato and take out area exists. Walking around just a little a bit shows Olive & Ivy is much bigger than you initially expect.  Service - 3 stars The service was good. Nothing exceptional comes to mind though the staff did seem to work as a fluid team. Good wait staff who'll probably do their best to accommodate your needs but more likely you'll get normal, friendly service.  Food - 4 stars The menu here is simple, with only about 5 categories of food and 4-6 options underneath them. This includes a section for bruschetta, salads, flatbreads, meats, and entrees. The bruschetta was excellent. They use fresh ingredients and the bread is crisp and flavorful. All the ingredients come together to compose a symphony in your mouth and though some are better than others, none are sub par. I was intrigued to try their shrimp risotto. Often times I have found risotto is usually under or overcooked so I was hoping Olive & Ivy would be the outlier; I was happy to be correct. When the risotto came out it did look like it might be overcooked but it was perfect. The rice was moist, plump, and took in the deep flavors of the stock it was boiled in. The spiciness of the Spanish chorizo was full and a great accent to the creaminess of the dish. Along with a tasty kale pesto the shrimp in the dish is plump and plentiful. They don't skimp on the meat and the bowl is a wonderful, filling meal. If they could make this dish this well every time more people would order risotto happily.  Price - 4 stars The price for the items aren't cheap. Most entrees will run around the $25-$29 range while the salads and flatbreads lean themselves to the $17 range. It'll be a bit on the expensive side but I highly recommend trying the food and it'll change your mind. You'll see food this good is worth it. Bring friends and do it as a share meal and you'll see it might even be less than you expect.  Conclusion  Olive & Ivy has a gorgeous atmosphere fitting of impressing dates and creating happiness. With a lavish interior and robust food this riverfront restaurant has all the makings of a great night out. A must try if you are in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"This place is great. The scenery is beautiful and the food is good. BUT most importantly the servers are fantastic. I've been here a few times sometimes dressed up, dressed poorly, and once had to sit in the awkward little sitting spot in the front. But the servers are consistently kind and caring. I didn't feel like dressed up, or dressed poorly, or put in that weird little spot that I was treated differently in any way. Keep it up servers and sorry for making you move around those outside heaters that one time. Arizona blood here."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. The Marketplace as well as the main restaurant. Had coffee every morning here while we were vacationing. Great espresso and friendly service. We especially loved their patio out back that overlooks the canal and into Old Town Scottsdale. Allie at the hostess stand is fabulous."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say that my very first meal in Arizona was a bit of a letdown. Admittedly, the setting is pretty scenic, but I kind of felt like I was in a suburban \"upscale\" mall restaurant that was trying to be more chic and happening than it could ever hope to be.   I went with a Cobb Salad, which should have been a simple choice but the leaves seemed a bit wilted and the entire serving just a tad bland, even after a hefty dosing of pepper on my part.   Still, service was relatively fast and friendly, so if I worked nearby, I can see how this could be an alright spot to keep on one's lunch circuit. No doubt about it, the best thing going here is the waterfront."}
{"text":"This place has amazing decor which creates the perfect ambiance. Very hipster but classy at the same time. The place is big enough for large parties.  I really like the bruschetta on their menu. It's $11 for3 bruschetta and you can choose from the 6/7 they have on the menu. Try the FRESH MOZZARELLA , ROASTED BRUSSELS SPROUT, or the  PROSCIUTTO & FIG. In addition, I got the MUSHROOM PAPPARDELLE which wasn't too bad.   Wish I came here for brunch because I hear great things about it. I definitely would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Came in for Sunday brunch w/4 other friends. This was our first of the Fox Restaurant Concepts and they made quite an impression on us! No one ordered any of the breakfast items--instead we had salads, gyros, and lots of drinks. I'll take that pesto dip & bread over chips & salsa any day! Lamb gyro was legit & VERY filling. The tableside mimosas were delicious especially for $5 a pop. The other cocktails were about $8 a pop and equally good. Altogether we spent about $150 for 5--a little pricier than expected but had a great time and left full!"}
{"text":"A really nice and welcoming restaurant. Service is met with high expectations and received. I went hear for my birthday, in which my girlfriend got them to surprise me with a birthday cake she got from a store. I had the veal and spinach ravioli, the dish has me craving for it even now."}
{"text":"Of all the Fox restaurants in town, I think this one is in my top 3. I've been wanting to try Olive and Ivy for a long time, so when I got notification that they were offering 25% off on Memorial day, I pretty much had to go. I (luckily) made a reservation (otherwise there was a 45 min wait at lunch time). We were seated right away. We had fantastic service throughout with a knowledgeable and friendly waitress. We had the delicious pesto and bread ( 2 servings because I'm a pig) and we split the bacon cheeseburger and the lasagna. The cheeseburger was tasty, with a definite charred taste to it. The onions were really good (and the pesto that came with the bread was good on it too). The lasagna was also tasty, with a distinctly red wine based Bolognese sauce. The portion was large allowing us to take half home. Also, it came with some of the most fantastic garlic bread.... just oozing with butter and garlic... I'd come here just for that. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was super impressed by Olive and Ivy considering it was in the Phoenix airport. After a terrifying flight from Los Angeles, a diverted landing to Tucson because of a dust storm, and a missed flight because of the diversion, Olive and Ivy made for a great breakfast after spending the night in the airport. The prices were just right, especially considering the airport location, and the food was fresh and good. Check it out next time you are trapped in the Phoenix airport."}
{"text":"Really cute little brunch place! I loved the atmosphere of it!  I came here for brunch with a friend. I think I've only been here once before. I ordered the Potato Hash. This comes with over easy eggs, onions, pepper and a sausage gravy. I really liked the sausage gravy that it came with. I felt like it could've been better with some more meat in it or maybe if there was actually hash browns. Of course I had to wash it down with a Mimosa since it IS brunch AND Sunday Funday. =) Their mimosas are only $5 on Sundays and do NOT come in those skinny little champagne glasses. lol.   I'd like to try something else next time I come and probably sit on their cute little patio that they have. Also would want to try their happy hour. =)"}
{"text":"Bacon dates Enough said You can't go wrong with that nor the hundreds of wine they have here. Drink some wine and look at those sculptured heads on the wall, guess how much they cost"}
{"text":"I have only been here for drinks so I cannot review the food at this time.   The design of this restaurant is great.  I love the wine room with wine stack floor to ceiling.    We ended up ordering drinks at the bar then wandering outside to sit by a fire  outside. I had a very nice view of the river and it is a very nice area of Scottsdale. It was a fun place to dress up and go out. I will have to come back and try the food."}
{"text":"Parents cane in from cali to visit and them here.   All of ours first time coming to olive and ivy and we were left speechless. This place is perfect from the second you walk in.  The decor, the ambience and the location alone make it a place to go to. The staff was helpful and the food came out quick. The food was phenomenal the bruchetta to the pasta to the seafood, all a must have."}
{"text":"This was a cool, bustling little spot for an afternoon lunch. Food was good, not over-the-top amazing. Sat at the bar with a colleague and we enjoyed our time. I would suggest not putting the receipt in front of the guests at the same time as they receive their food. It gives the customer a sense of rushing and that they cannot order another drink or dessert."}
{"text":"I can't wait to come back here. Everything I had was delicious. My favorite part might be the pesto sauce for dipping...  We had brushetta, the soup (it was something with cauliflower in it), the proscuitto flat bread, and the gnocchi. All of it was so good, I can't pick a favorite. They also have a great wine list. Our serve was fantastic, attentive, and had great suggestions for us."}
{"text":"Great patio. Food was very good. Had the beet salad and the fungi flatbread"}
{"text":"Not much to say that hasn't already been said, so here's the short review.  The starter bread and pesto were amazing. Best pesto ever.  Appetizer was the calamari/shrimp/zucchini and it was so good. And I'm not even a super fan of calamari.   I had the lasagna and my girl had the flatbread. Both were excellent.  Our server was great, and even the water was good - which outside of AZ isn't usually a consideration, but not having it taste like dirt was nice.   Been here a few times and always have had a great experience."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and location was great. Service and drinks were good. Food was mediocre. I had lasagna bolognese, and it was bland. I had to add a lot of salt. My husband had veal ravioli which was ok. I would give the atmosphere a 4 or 5, and food 2.5 to 3. Great people watching, and location is great."}
{"text":"I have to say Phoenix airport has the best restaurants.  This was a very nice airport restaurant, I had one of the best breakfast shakes ever, and for a decent price of $5.  They also had very good cups of soup for only $2."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Amazing food, design and atmosphere.  Had a perfect birthday dinner tonight for the GF.  Bread with pesto to start, bacon wrapped dates, Sangaria to drink and Lasagna/Pasta entries... All perfect!  Thank you guys!!"}
{"text":"I'd like to keep it short here goes...  Location is very nice.  Inside or out, the atmosphere is very pretty and pleasant  The food is good.  Some dishes are very good, but over all not great.  The bar is were we had the biggest disappointment.  It is a pricey bar that serves less than impressive drinks.  The Moscow mule was a sour pill and I have never had it this bad. The sangria my wife had was also disappointing.  The scotch selection is basically what you find on the super market shelf - not bad but only the average stuff.    The staff is young, nice but a bit scarce.  We can't go back but it is in a very nice place."}
{"text":"The location is terrific even if the parking is moderately terrible. The food is good and it has really terrific outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I didn't have a good experience here... I took my Mother to lunch for the first time and we both ordered salads. The cashier asked us if we wanted to add chicken - we both replied \"yes\" and she said \"cold or grilled\" - we both said grilled. Our total bill was a little higher than expected so my mom nicely asked why. The girl was extremely rude and said, \"grilled chicken is more.\"  and basically laughed at my mom for even asking the question... We were not rude, we did not ask for it to be taken off the bill - just a simple question. I've worked in the service industry for years and it rubs me the wrong way, because she was completely polite while asking a valid question. I have had lunch in the actual dining room and I had a wonderful experience with a MUCH more friendly staff, so I will just stick to that instead."}
{"text":"Almost walked out as hostess was without the mostest! BUT because we always (in the past) received the BEST service we decided not to leave and treat mom to a new restaurant and just wanted an enjoyable afternoon.Food was AMAZING as usual as well as our waiter Christian (Thant you for your excellent customer service)."}
{"text":"Perfect date night restaurant! Try to get a seat on the patio it is very romantic. Our food was amazing and the waiter made us laugh and was very attentive. We had the best time here!"}
{"text":"The food at Olive and Ivy was delicious, with options for different dietary preferences/restrictions. We really enjoyed the bruschettas and the fish entrees. The lamb meatballs were great as well. The space is huge, so there is plenty of room for large groups. The only downside was that while we got appetizers fairly quickly, the kitchen took forever with the main dishes. Otherwise, the service was great and they did apologize for the delay in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I like this place! I'm a fan of the restaurant in Scottsdale and I was pleased with the selection at the airport. It is definitely limited, you can't expect a full menu in a to-go line, but the food is fresh and good."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of this place! The layout alone makes it worth it. They have a huge outdoor patio which is lovely most of the year. The inside is great too, they have a bar that is perfect for happy hour, and a market as well with coffee, pastries, other drinks, and various sorbets if you want something light or something to go.  Don't be afraid to dive into the bread they bring at the beginning of the meal; the pesto is fabulous! I'm a huge fan of the Mediterranean salad, which I get with salmon. I have a lot of business lunch meetings here, but day or night this is a great place to work or play!"}
{"text":"There was a 30 minute wait so we went next door to the Marketplace (same restaurant). This is a bacon lovers paradise! The blt sandwich was great and the service was awesome."}
{"text":"The two star rating says this \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" and that's exactly how I would describe Olive and Ivy. I've been here two times now and each time left thinking \"nothing special\" \"over priced\".  First time I went here I had a gyro and it was good. Nothing to make me go back again, but good. Second time here, I honestly don't even remember what I ordered.  The service both times was very good. Attentive and as fast as they can. The bread is also very good, probably my favorite part.  Take a look at the menu and see what you think. This place is very popular and people love it, I guess it's just not for me."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful atmosphere and scrumptious food! The pesto is superb! The hummus - best I have ever had and I am a hummus lover! Mason was our waiter. A true gentleman! He made our night! Great service! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Brunch menu is straightforward with a few twists. I struggled finding something that jumped off the page that I wanted to try but was happy with my order.   Their version of a Moscow Mule is excellent. Overall we have always been happy with our drinks here but I was a little disappointed in their take on an old fashion.   Atmosphere is modern but the lighting makes it cozy. The outdoor patio is near the canal, from your seat you can see the art installations over the canal or near it.   Park at the Nordstrom parking garage if you can't find street parking or don't want to valet."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a birthday and was very satisfied with the visit. Our waiter, Kevin, did an outstanding job and was very friendly. The food was amazing as always. We tried the peanut butter mousse dessert for the first time and it was so rich, full of texture, and delicious! I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Worst service, my food took 40 min, to get my food and the server just gave me attitude and forgot to place an order, not worth my money, and yes I'm disappointed with the service, because it's a nice place."}
{"text":"Great friendly service.  Breakfast sandwich is the greatest! Really!!  They do need a soda fountain, but that's ok."}
{"text":"The food looked nice on the plate but the taste wasn't anything my family can't cook in the kitchen. The ambiance of the restaurant was very impressive but there is nothing that can save a restaurant if they can't put out stellar product."}
{"text":"Amazing place. A definite go to for lunch and great patio. Food is way above par and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Really liked this place.  Beautiful setting.  Good food except the lamb.  Don't order that.  Wine was good service was great.  Not cheap"}
{"text":"A bunch of my friends surprised me with a birthday dinner here and I was impressed.  We got the whole back room to ourselves and this place was booming!  I started off with two Moscow Mules and they were reallllll good.  Liked that they put in a little more lime.  The dinner was great and everyone had something different.  I had the chicken scaloppini and it hit the spot.    They let us bring in our own cupcakes, ya know this dude has a sweet tooth. Really enjoyed our experience and I dunno about you, but I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere eating under the lighted trees beside the canal. They make delicious pesto fresh every day for their bread. Good pork tenderloin and amazing tres leeches!"}
{"text":"Food wand ambiance was phenomenal - Amanda was a great server she was so nice and knowledgeable !"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Best place to eat if you are in Scottsdale area. Food taste amazing."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The restaurant itself has an amazing ambience and the food is amazing! We always check this place out after a busy day of shopping.   Very reasonably priced and very, very good."}
{"text":"In celebration of how awesome our team is at work, we were taken to Olive & Ivy. We were seated at a large table inside that overlooked the patio the fountains and the \"waterfront\" (i say \"waterfront\" because it's actually a canal, and it seems so silly to refer to it as the \"waterfront\"). The weather was beautiful, so all of the sliders were open, and the view was actually really nice.   We started out by ordering two bottles of the Russian Jack Pinot Noir. It was the perfect choice with our dinner- light but flavorful. I'd definitely order it again. We also ordered two flatbreads, the sweet corn & tomato and the asparagus & wild mushroom. If you really twisted my arm, I might say that the corn & tomato was my favorite. But they were both so delicious, that it really is a tough decision. Before bringing our entrees, our waitress brought out the focaccia bread with pesto dipping sauce. I had to really try and restrain myself from eating all of it, so I would still have room for dinner, but it was hard because that stuff is delicious!   When my meal arrived, I was slightly disappointed by how small it looked. I thought that maybe I should have loaded up on the focaccia while I still had the chance. I had ordered the Sweet Potato Cannelloni, and after the waitresses ravings, was really hoping for something a little larger. But when I took my first bite, everything changed. The sauce was so rich, and the only thing I can think to compare it to was cake. Each little bite of cannelloni was taking a bite of the best cake I've ever had. It was so sweet, but not overly sweet. And with little pearl onions and brussel sprout leaves scattered throughout, I was seriously in Heaven. I devoured my meal, even though I felt full about half way through, I just couldn't stop.   The ambiance and service was great, but the food was amazing. It's definitely on the pricey side, but so worth the cost. I encourage everyone to stop in for a little bit of Heaven."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, and the atmosphere was even better! It is a bit pricey, so come prepared. Overall, Olive & Ivy had great service, and I will definitely be going back. I gave it four stars because there isn't a whole bunch of options to chose from."}
{"text":"Loved this place!!!    My husband and I were in the area attending my family reunion, and this restaurant was recommended by a staff member at the Hyatt Place.   It was a short walk from our hotel.  We went around 1 pm for lunch on a Monday. There was no wait at all for inside seating and 1/2 hour for outdoor seating (we were in a rush so we sat inside).  It was a nice atmosphere both indoor and outdoor, and their bathrooms were also very clean and cool looking.  Our waiter was friendly and gave us good recommendations.  We started with the bread with pesto. This was the best pesto I've ever tasted.  I think maybe it had more cheese than most I've tried.    I ordered the butternut squash and spinach cannollini (sp).  It was absolutely delicious! I LOVED the different flavors I tasted with each bite, a sweet and salty taste - almond slivers, spinach, mushrooms, squash, butter sauce, etc.   My husband is a basic kind of guy when it comes to food, so he ordered the burger on toasted wheat bread (he does not like ciabatta and all of the other fluffy 'foo foo' type of bread).  He said the burger tasted fresh and it had arugula on it, not your standard burger.  The fries were also good.  My husband had a peach bellini which was delicious, and I had a red sangria which was also great.  When we were done, I decided to walk through the area with the gelato.  I ended up with 1 scoop of Oreo cookie and cheesecake gelato and another of blueberry cheesecake gelato.  Both were creamy and delicious.  This was our last dining experience before leaving AZ.  We had a great time in AZ and this was the icing on the cake.  I am SOOO glad we decided to come here!"}
{"text":"Lunch business meeting.  A bit loud for this type of event.  Superb service .  Interesting dinning room.  Limited menu but very nice portions.  Cup of delicious soup and 1/2 Mediterranean salad with shrimp was plenty."}
{"text":"My fiance and I had a romantic evening here for Valentine's weekend and I loved every moment of our experience. The mood, the customer service, the cocktails and the food! Nicole D. was our sever and she recommended sooo many delicious things! We had the sweet potato cannelloni- so phenominal and unique, and the chicken scallopini (again- amaze!!!) Such a lovely night and we can't wait to come back!!!!"}
{"text":"The location along the canal with the open doors and courtyard of sorts is aesthetically pleasing.  The menu is mostly tilted toward Mediterranean cuisine with some more American standbys mixed in as a back up for those less adventurous.  Overall, the quality was quite good and the service prompt and professional.  This place falls into the \"after work, wine and a light bite\" category.  The layout is conducive to social interaction, so bringing a group of 6-8 is definitely feasible.  I would go back."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants to have lunch with friends. The food and the service is outstanding!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's always consistent. The service is attentive and knowledgeable (in fact... some of the most knowledgeable wait staff I've seen).  The drinks are consistently good and they have a good wine list. They are also fairly well equipped for large groups with private rooms and large tables in the main dining room.    The food is good, but not great.  It's never bad...  it's consistently decent, but doesn't blow me away.  I recommend the scallops, but replace the corn with salad...  the corn is a strange combination and not very tasty.  The kale salad is good, but too much kale without enough other parts of the salad mixed in.  The staff and ambiance are the winning aspects to this place."}
{"text":"They have the best patio in AZ. Comfortable and beautiful and right on the waterfront. The drinks are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Although I haven't been back to O&I, I was contacted by a fox rep and they were very courteous and made things right after my bad experience. I go to Blanco and Culinary Dropout frequently and will probably try North this time around. Thanks FOX!"}
{"text":"It was only a little after 8am when I arrived in Phoenix so I was still on breakfast time. I wasn't starving but had a long flight ahead of me so I made my way over to Olive & Ivy. I was a little disappointed to see that many of the photos uploaded by the restaurant were not options for breakfast (i.e. eggs Benedict, pancakes, etc...). It's not a huge deal, but I assume those or professional photos from their other location which is a bit misleading.  I ended up with the O&I Breakfast sandwich. It was your standard sausage, egg, and cheese on an English muffin, but they add a tomato to make it fancy. It looks like the quality of products used was slightly elevated but not worth the $8 price tag. The lunch menu looked better so I'd prefer to try that in the future."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance here! The drinks (both alcoholic and coffee) are delicious. Loved the Moscow mule I had there. I've gotten the sweet potato cannelloni twice and loved it both times, highly recommend. The beet salad was light and refreshing. Everything is made in house, so their bread is incredible. This is a fun place to take friends for lunch if you can't decide where to go!"}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend on a Saturday night. Very nice vibe with a live dj. The service is phenomenal and don't have to wait for food because they have four lines in their kitchen. Must have- red sangria and their chicken scallopini. The outside patio is huge for lounging with cute patio furniture and lights. Gentlemen, take your ladies here"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. The atmosphere is beautiful, the service is impeccable and the food is beyond delicious. Highly recommend getting the scallops - I didn't even like scallops until I had them from here. Everything is made from scratch too. Again, absolutely amazing and was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Josh P. offered impeccable service tonight! The food and ambiance was amazing! So happy we made it out here. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The best patio experience is Olive & ivy.  I love there food and wine selection."}
{"text":"Such a great place! Love the location near the mall and the ambiance is great. The service was fantastic, with our drinks always full. Food and menu are terrific. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great fox concept in old town. The only o&i and is still a great spot to come for lunch dinner drinks. Plus they have a good happy hour m-f 3 to 6. Great patio on the waterfront."}
{"text":"Nine of us gals ate here on Saturday night this past MDW and.... WE.ABSOLUTELY.LOVED.IT!!  Our server (ugh!! I can't believe I forgot his name) was AMAZING! He took such great care of us, never once let a water glass go empty, made sure our cocktails kept coming, and paid close attention to our few friends with food allergies. We all enjoyed the appetizers, our mains, and dessert. I can't remember what everyone else ordered... but I do recall ordering the artichoke hearts, lamb meatballs, and bacon wrapped dates to start with.  Did we enjoy them?   Uh - yah... I would say so as there wasn't a crumb left on the plates, haha. For my main, I ordered the shrimp scampi risotto.  Those who know me well, know that I love risotto so ordering this dish was no surprise.  Plus, I needed to eat something hearty that would soak up the alcohol once we entered Scottsdale's \"entertainment district\", lol! Anyway... I really enjoyed my dish and have no complaints.  I would definitely return to Olive & Ivy the next time I'm in Scottsdale.  We all had a wonderfully delicious time here!"}
{"text":"I recently visited Olive and Ivy and had a lot to say about our experience! Check it out in my recent blog post: https://thebloghasspoken.com/2017/07/13/scottsdale-superhero/."}
{"text":"Mixed bag all around, but overall a fan.   Vibe - 5 stars. Really cool place, very modern with an open view into the kitchen and marketplace area. Loud music playing which is surprisingly pretty cool during dinner.  Drinks - 1 star. watered down old fashioned, damn near sent it back. Came stacked with ice and just overall disappointing. Ordered a beer and they opened the can at the table. Seemed kinda tacky.   Service - 1 star. Pretty miserable server. Asked for a recommendation and he listed 95% of the menu. Asked for more bread to have with our meal, he agreed and it never showed up. Asked for the heater to be turned on since it was a bit chilly and he proceeded to get annoyed and literally kick a chair out of frustration. Multiple tables noticed. Not a good look.  Food - 4.5 stars. Bruschetta sampler is awesome - the avocado and the mushroom are both excellent. Docking .5 star because the prosciutto was underwhelming due to one very tiny slice hidden under a bed of arugula. Veal and Spinach ravioli were awesome, incredible sauce."}
{"text":"I love the ambience here maybe even a little bit more than the food what we had was pretty basic my niece had a huge salad and I ordered the hummus which was to die for, although the pita left a lot to be desired. I also ordered some bruschetta that was pretty good and a small plate combining fried shrimp and calamari. It was pretty good to all in all I didn't think there was a lot of variety for the lunch and the food although good was nothing I would rave about. What was impressive was the dessert display when you first walk in the restaurant.  I didn't have any but even now when I remember it I wish I had tried a couple!"}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy (or as our server, Tommy called it, \"The Ivy\") never disappoints.  Can count on them to be consistent with service and quality of food.    Little did we know we'd have entertainment included in our lunch - Tommy was great and really took his time to explain his favorite items and cocktails.  His energy and happiness was contagious, and you could tell he had a passion for the food he served his guests.    The food is great as well - the Lamb Gyro, Mediterranean Salad, Chicken Panini, Bruschetta, Calamari, Caesar Salad w/Salmon...all great lunch choices.  But I have to admit...I look forward to the bread and pesto they bring to the table as much as anything.  SO good!  And if I'm not on my lunch break, a pitcher of their White Sangria pairs nicely.    5 stars to you, \"Ivy\", and Tommy!"}
{"text":"Formerly, one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona.  In my last visit, I ordered my favorite pasta dish, and was offered a \"protein\" addition.  I chose scallops-when the waiter asked how many, I said 5, assuming it would be a flat rate.  Boy, was I wrong.  I was charged PER SCALLOP, adding an additional $20 to my entree.  Really???  How do you charge for additional chicken?  And, they were just ok.  If I go back, I will not be suckered into that again.  BUYER BEWARE"}
{"text":"Managers are HORRIBLE! Tried to book a party and was treated very badly. They would rather leave their GOLD ROOM empty then to let customers utilize it. My suggestion for big parties is to either go to HEB BOX or KELLYS. Much nicer- friendlier and not as snotty!"}
{"text":"Not your average airport food. Located in terminal 4, they serve breakfast lunch and dinner and offer beer and wine. They had a good selection on the menu. I had the turkey club panini with bacon and avocado on it. The ingredients were super fresh and delicious. Would definitely order that again if I'm ever here. My sister had the grilled cheese which was just cheese on bread...nothing to write home about. The service was a little inefficient but friendly."}
{"text":"5 stars all the way!!!! We came here after our NYE celebration.. and it was one of the best choices we made that weekend! It's located in the beautiful mall of Scottsdale and on a nice day, you can sit outside by the water. Our entire group left wanting more. The ambiance is great.. they even have live music on Sat's/Sun!! I ordered the vanilla bean yogurt parfait and the Greek chicken salad.. and It was to DIE for! I was also excited to find out that they have one in Newport Beach.. can wait to check it out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had an early, light dinner of appetizers or what is called at O&I,  small plates. We shared the antipasto plate, lamb meatballs and bacon wrapped dates and 2 glasses of wine. Everything was tasty but nothing that wow'ed. Service was good, prompt. Would we go back probably not, too many other places in the area. Word of caution. We used a $100.00 gift card and noticed they took an automatic 20% off the card for gratuity. We would have given the server 20% but if we weren't paying attention we could have mistakenly doubled the tip."}
{"text":"I had lunch here and it was fantastic. Having never been on a  weekday (since I usually go for their Sunday brunch) I was very surprised to see how large of a menu they offer. So many choices...  I went with the Ahi Tuna. It was under the salad menu, but it really wasn't a salad. Three pieces of delicious tuna were seared and then drizzled with a soy dressing. On the side was a shaved veggie salad, also good, that came with mushrooms mixed in.   Surprisingly, this was very filling. I had two cups of their Victrola coffee (a new fave) and left very, very, very happy - with the food, the service, the atmosphere... It's just great here!   Sure, I paid a little too much for lunch, if you ask me. $15 for my salad, but it was one of the most pricey items on the menu. (What can I say? I couldn't help myself). I paid about $2.50 for coffee with fresh cream. Mmmm. Love the fresh cream. Love the coffee!   Speaking of love, you can buy their pesto in their market area. It goes for $1 an oz, so be aware of that. Also in that area you can buy single beers. I'm not sure if you have to drink them there, with your food, or if you can bag it up and go. Hmm. Will have to check that out the next time I go. I did discover that the service on the market side of things is very lacking. It's a good thing they have the restaurant side. I absolutely love going here!"}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy has to be one of my favorite lunch spots here in the valley. The inside of restaurant itself is beautiful but I've always taken the opportunity to sit outside on their amazing patio. It really is like sitting out on your own little garden patio - minus the 50+ other people that might be out there! Whether you're seated under a shade tree or next to a bubbling fountain, it is hard to believe that you're still in the middle of the desert. Besides the patio, the food is what keeps bringing me back to the restaurant. Everything is made from scratch - and you can tell! The salads are flavorful and filling, the sandwiches are delicious, and the flatbreads are innovative and wonderful! Possibly the best parts of the meal are the pesto and bread and their white sangria. Every time I've been there I wish on a little star that the pesto and bread would continue to magically appear on the plate in front of me. I also have yet to pass up the opportunity to get some of their white sangria. The orange sugar coated rims adorn the sweet and flavorful mix of fruit and white wine (again wishing that would never end as well!). Because of the beautiful space, delicious food, and helpful staff I am happy to give Olive and Ivy 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here with friends out on the patio by the canal. It was super relaxing. Love the christmas lights yay! I had a simple lettuce salad and fig flatbread, which were both wonderful. For desert our party ordered the pound with apricots which was very meh to say the least. Either that or pound cake just sucks. It might be the latter. It was super dry. We got a scoop of vanilla ice cream with it which we were all fighting over. Definitely would go with a simple two scoops next time and leave it at that. Oh yea, and loved the wine and drink selection and our very knowledgable waitress."}
{"text":"I go there for the Sangria alone! It's amazing! There food is good, but they took away my favorite flatbread! Great ambiance. Perfect place for a meet up with the girls."}
{"text":"This is a staple for Old Town Scottsdale and for good reason. Great place to meet up for a drink, get dinner, hang out on the patio on a nice day, hold an event in one of their cool dining rooms, or grab a little breakfast at their attached cafe. They can really do it all anytime of the day, year round, and everything is good. I can't remember ever having bad service and I wouldn't go there so often if I did. It's a staple for Scottsdale and a consistent \"go to\" spot for me."}
{"text":"Probably one of the nicest patios (esp since smell gone) but food only ok, overpriced & arrogant staff/mgmt."}
{"text":"I had a quick bite here when connecting through PHX.  I got the oatmeal and a protein shake.  Both were pretty good, but nothing to write home about.  It came to $13 total which was reasonable for an airport, I suppose.  Seating was a bit of an issue based on the time I went (~830am so breakfast peak).  My friend and I managed to find some bar-stools and parked ourselves there, which worked out.  I noted that the stools are pretty heavy to move!  OK overall."}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy is quick, easy, and reliable.  We enjoy their breakfast/brunch options, bruschetta, flatbreads, and pasts the most.  The sandwiches have been less impressive--not as flavorful or as satisfying.    Take note, they typically offer fresh foccacia at the beginning of the meal, and it's easy to fill-up on it if you've already ordered bruschetta, too!  Lots of love for the butternut squash, fungi, and prosciutto and fig bruschetta.  We really like the funghi trifolato flatbread.  The sweet potato cannelloni is sweet and savory, and it's a rich dish but very good.  I've also had the bone-in ribeye, which is good and was cooked medium rare."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my new favorite places. What a stunning restaurant. In a gorgeous location by the water. With an awesome atmosphere AND great music. This is a sophisticated, classy joint and the service did not disappoint either.  The sweet potato cannelloni is one of the best pasta dishes I've ever tasted. I cannot WAIT to go back!"}
{"text":"it's always packed here (even tho we came during lunch on a WEEKDAY -- the heck???) so we had to sit in the community seating area outside since we weren't about to wait an hour to get seated. now, i got the veggie flatbread and it wasn't AMAZING but i still finish it all. would i order it again? no. and the white sangria was a disappointment, would not recommend anyone to order that lol."}
{"text":"I got the bacon, egg and cheese club. Good, but not amazing. It's on par - if not slightly better - than Panera. I would recommend this place if you're in the area for breakfast. In fact, the bacon was worth 5 stars.   Prices aren't bad either - for what I got and a coke was just over $10."}
{"text":"Brunch, lunch or dinner - it doesn't matter! This place is great! Wonderful patio for when the weather is our friend and a great atmosphere inside for when it's not."}
{"text":"Perfect every time! The lunch is the best! Pesto and focaccia is always a delicious treat before the panini I order and the burger my sister always gets. Never a disappointment. Drinks: blood orange paloma- refreshing! And the ivy and ginger- mouthwatering, ask for a little extra pineapple juice on the side!   Love it!!"}
{"text":"Great food, prices are reasonable, service is excellent. We've been back many times and haven't tired of it yet. Plan to return soon."}
{"text":"Enjoy the energy. The cocktails are yummmmmmy.  The menu isn't inspiring per se, but some good salad options.  Nice place to people watch and driiiink"}
{"text":"I came to Olive and Ivy this past weekend hoping to enjoy AZ restaurant week, but they didn't have it for lunch time.  While my friend and I were quite disappointed, we turned the brunch into our own selection of menu items.  Her son got the Eggs Benedict with roasted potatoes that looked really yummy.  My friend and I shared the Mediterranean Salad and Flatbread pizza.  The ambiance of the restaurant felt very brunch-like and earthy type of feeling.  I felt very relaxed and my tummy felt in peace on a sunny day in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was bad. The waiter(name was Joe) that we got was awkward and slow. My friend said that he reminded her of the sloth from Zootopia. He also interrupted our conversation at least 4 times. He took his time setting up the utensils and clean off the plates and it was very awkward. The icing on the cake was when he gave me my credit card and called me \"Siri\". At the end of the night he looked at our receipts (again slowly to check the tip amount) and when I got to mine he paused and said \"Really?\" and walked off. Yes, really I'm not giving you 20% for bad service."}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy is by far my favorite restaurant. At this point I whole heartedly know that if I'm going to a restaurant owned by Fox Concepts it's going to be fantastic. I love the overall theme of Olive and Ivy. The mixture of old and new school class is really nice. Servers are always attentive and are great at time management and handling all of their tables professionally and Efficiently. I had Pita and Hummus as an appetizer and it's definitely my new fave. The prosciutto mascarpone tortellini is to die for. I sipped on White Wine Sangria while I thought was way better than some other restaurants I had drank it at recently. This is the perfect place whether you're looking for a light lunch or a classy date night on the canal. 10/10 would recommend. Will be back many, many more times!"}
{"text":"There's nothing better than escaping sub-zero temperatures for the toasty climes of Phoenix. I was lucky enough to do this last week (pre-Snowpacolypse), and there was no better way to enjoy the sun than sitting by the fountain on the patio at Olive and Ivy.  At first glance, I thought this spot was going to be a bit stuffy since it's located in a pseudo strip mall area. However, the second I stepped inside my opinion changed. It can only be described as lofty, with eye-catching light fixtures and decor. Although I didn't notice it until my way out, I am totally enamored with the white room just off the front door - it features a large round table for 12 (I think) with high-backed chairs, ethereal curtains and a to-die-for white glass chandelier. Very intimate and would be fun for a brunch party, methinks.  Don't pass up the bread and pesto here, my friends. It will put a smile on your face, as will the mushroom and asparagus truffle pizza. We tried several flatbreads, but that was definitely the standout. I enjoyed a few sips of the house sangria and am a fan of the sugared rim, and quite enjoyed my chicken curry salad, too. Just an observation - it seems like their salads are heavy on the dressing, so if you're picky about that, order yours on the side.   Stellar service here (our server was a life coach and I just wanted to hug her), and their bathroom is going on my Arizona top 10 list. Think oversized doors, floor to ceiling mirrors, and a trough-style sink. On second thought, can I hire their decorator to re-do my apartment??  As you can see, I'm a fan. It looks like they also have a little market area complete with a gelato counter in case you want to get your foodies to go. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Super cute and modern ambiance, reasonably priced beautiful delicious food, and helpful friendly staff.  I've been here for dinner and brunch it has impressed me both times.  It seems like they accommodate for large groups as well.  I would definitely continue to go here."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was awesome, and the atmosphere was perfect!  We were there for a bachelorette party dinner and the staff humored us and our giant inflatable friend.  Our server, Ashton, was a doll and didn't steer us wrong on drink or dinner recommendations. He also brought us a round of shots to start the party! I had wine but one of the girls had a delicious Moscow mule... For dinner I shared the kale salad with another girl and we devoured it.  Yum! I went with the English Pea Tortelli and it was very flavorful without being too heavy.  I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. When I went to Olive and Ivy, we just had drinks, however from what I understand, all of the Fox restaurants have excellent food.  I really liked the outdoor seating - right next to the Canal. Nice way to spend a Friday evening having drinks on the patio. And if I remember, they had very reasonable prices. Parking is not too bad, you'll probably end up parking at the garage next to Nordstrom."}
{"text":"we are are on an quest to rank the Top Ten Chocolate Cakes in Old Town Scottsdale. this is the third place we've tried so far and I'm guessing it will finish in 9th place.  olive and Ivy has great ambiance and vibe. the ranking is based solely on our mission for Chocolate Cake."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch recently and had a great experience. We sat at the bar and were taken care of by the bartender, which unfortunately I cannot remember his name. He made great conversation and treated us very well. We started with the Mediterranean Salad which was outstanding. I recommend this highly. We then had the Roasted Mushroom Flatbread. This was delicious. The roasted mushrooms, with Taleggio Cheese and a drizzle of truffle oil was so good that we cannot wait to come back for just that.   If you're in the area do not miss this place."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times for both dinner and lunch.  The food is good but I don't think the menu is that exciting.  All items you can get somewhere else.  That can be a good thing though, we you are dining with people who are not adventurous eaters.  Most people are pretty happy with this place.  Great place for lunch to grab some of the to-go food and sit outside on the sidewalk tables.  Price is not too bad.  If you time it right, you can get some of the fancy bakery items from breakfast marked down to sell.  For dinner this place has great ambiance.  Pricey enough to make it special occasion place but the atmosphere is not too stuffy and formal.  Very chill vibe."}
{"text":"Very nice dinner here tonight. The patio is beautiful but we did sit inside. They had a DJ ( Saturday night) and it was busy but not overwhelming. Our server, Victoria, was friendly and prompt.  The appetizer came out very quickly and we devoured the wrapped dates in minutes- so good. We ordered the lasagna which was excellent, the scallops, which were good but a little dull- not sure if they were marinated or not, and the natural chicken which had a surprising amount of flavor.  Prices are a little high for what you get, but the surroundings are gorgeous."}
{"text":"Olive, Ivy -- you are both gorgeous and sexy - I LOVE YOU!  Perhaps it may be lust, but how will we ever know for sure unless we spend more time together?  What I mean is, much more time.  In fact, I'd like to move in.  Seriously.  What a beautifully designed place, with candles and great lighting, large windows, and an absolute deliciousness IS the essence of Olive & Ivy. Featuring a great happy hour, sangria, Mediterranean / Italian fare; it's a coffee shop, bar, restaurant, and market all-in-one. So nice and complete - a perfect offering is what I say!  Great wine selection, a fun & lively environment, and great food. Outside tables are especially lovely on a nice day or evening, but in the summer heat - no, no, NO.    Whether this is for a date, a small group, or a 'happy hour' with your co-workers...this place could be the object of your desire (as well)."}
{"text":"Fun and lively atmosphere!  Excellent bruschetta options!  Delicious!  We went for my birthday and I was too full for dessert so they gave me a birthday shot instead!  We can't wait to go back!  Our waitress was so good!  Loved her!"}
{"text":"Dreading the long week and need a quick fix before the weekend hits?! Head down over to this behemoth of upscale delight that serves up a tasty Mediterranean menu that will keep your wallet and plastic cards happy .    If you are savvy with the Fox Concept brand, then you know exactly what I'm talking about--another masterpiece done up  by the creators of True Food Kitchen and Modern Steak.  + Happy Hour + 4-6PM + Lounge, the Main Bar, Patio (w/ Mist)  If you roll up with a clan of say 6-8, try to grab lounge seating which is located in the Bar area, especially in the Summer! the Main Bar is swanky  and spacious.  Once fall hits, the Patio might be the most ideal to enjoy some nice weather.  Ohh k, Let's talk food and drinks! the real reason why we even bother, right?  + Sangria: $5, white (lychee, blood orange, peach), red (blackberry, rasberry, strawberry, tempranillo) - decided this be my favorite one of the two, you can get a small sampling before you try, both are not too sweet just right, unfortunately no hard fruits in them but still satisfying  + Flatbreads: $8, there's 5 to choose from, I personally enjoyed the prosciutto crudo (crispy potato, asparagus & fried egg) and piccante (italian sausage & spicy salami), love EGG on my pizzas! spread it over like jelly on a toast!  + Bacon Wrapped Dates: italian sausage & piquillo pepper, you get the sweet and savory, wasn't as crispy but still pleasing  I know some in the group ordered some Bruschetta but I did not get to try.  So can't comment much.  What could I say about service? Attentive, friendly and eye candy.  Just saying, from the host to the bartenders to the servers.  If you were not wow'd by the ultra posh dining and bar area, the bathroom will.  Might be the most stylized toilette I've ever tainted! Let's just say the bathroom stalls have wooden doors!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wUKzaS1MHg94RGM6z8u9mw?select=IfEvXEYxoJJt5rg7h92Feg  With little room to complain, Olive and Ivy sounds to me like a winner, winner chicken dinner to help you get through your slacker ways week! ;-p"}
{"text":"We sat in market and had instant service. You order at the bar then find a seat, or take-out.  Cinnamon roll was amazing! Omelet was very good  and perfect serving size.  Highly recommend this one."}
{"text":"We made a reservation on NYE, and we're seated right on time. We are from Chicago and wasn't sure what to expect but we really enjoyed the atmosphere. There was a limited menu for NYE but that didn't matter, started with hummus and bruschetta trio.... AMAZING!!!!!!!! She had chicken scallopini so good, I found my knife and fork drifting over a few times. I ordered the sea scallops which were hands down the best scallops I have ever had and Chicago isn't short on seafood dining. We cannot wait to return to try out their full menu. To add we sat outside on the patio, and again being from Chicago and able to be dining outside on Dec 31 was amazing. Plenty of patio heaters and the patio is so beautiful at night with the water right there. Fire pits I'm sure are not active in summer months but were a very nice touch."}
{"text":"Was in the Phoenix area for a convention and a local friend of mine suggested Olive & Ivy. We had a wonderful dinner sitting outside on their lovely patio. They had a spectacular wine list and unique dishes. I had scallops over creamed corn and something else .. lots of fresh herbs. It was so different so amazingly good. Service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Olive and Ivy has been my go to spot for years now! Great for a casual dinner, an occasion dinner, drinks, or a fun brunch with girlfriends. The food is fantastic and offers a large variety of healthy options. My personal favorite is the kale and apple salad. The ambiance is very inviting really transforms your experience into something magical. The service has never been less than wonderful and the location is right in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. Couldn't ask for more!"}
{"text":"Big fan of this spot!! I've been here twice now and I'm really impressed with the food, service, ambience and the location is just perfect. Great place to bring people visiting from out of town so you can walk around old town before or after your meal. The bridge is a great place to take pics. The restaurant patio is super cute, overlooks the little river and reminds me a little of Europe.   Food is fresh and service is great. They provide you with complimentary bread and fresh pesto. I had to refrain myself from licking the plate! I split a burger and kale salad with a friend and they actually split it for us which was super thoughtful of them. Burger was fantastic. Kale salad was huge, even when it was split. I've been for both brunch and dinner now and both menus are great. Sometimes they have a live dj in the evening which creates a fun ambiance.   Love that they've managed to create a classy place without it feeling too upscale or stuffy. Prices are affordable too. Can't wait to return and try their desserts!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Scottsdale!! I love everything about it- the food, drinks, patio, service, and ambience. All of it is amazing!! I've only been here for brunch but I can't wait to go back for dinner! The mimosas are six dollars and are awesome pours for the price. I've had the cheddar biscuits and the breakfast burrito-I recommend both of them!!   Definitely make a reservation on open table for quick seating!"}
{"text":"Review is for breakfast. I can not believe how cheap it is in the land of the 20 dollar breakfast joints these days. I was also surprised how good the food is. I am not much of a Breakfast gal but the toast and sausage and potatoes are really delish! The breakfast special is only 6 bucks. Can't beat that deal. The patio is animal friendly. The only negative was that it took a very long time to get our food."}
{"text":"Olive & Ivy is so gorgeous! It's huge and super crowded. We walked in to try to have brunch and were told that there would be a 45 minute wait for a table. A few bar seats opened up so we stationed ourselves there instead. The Moscow Mules were to my liking (\"Mediterranean Mules\") and I ordered a tasty Lamb Gyro sandwich. I definitely had food envy when his perfectly cooked salmon arrived. It was delicious.  When 3pm hit, we also ordered bacon wrapped dates from the limited dinner menu. I wish we would've had time to try Olive & Ivy for dinner. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the valley!  Always great food, great service, and great location!  Can't beat the atmosphere.  I've only been here for dinner but it's been amazing every time and the wait staff/chefs are willing and ready to do anything we ask with the food.  Best tasting salmon and beet dinner ever!  Update: They somehow got better!  The wait staff went above and beyond for my group this past time and were some of the most accommodating I've ever had.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Baaa.  Siiisss.  Boooo.  You played it way to safe with this one Fox.   There are no upscale Mediterranean/tapas style restaurants in Scottsdale, so I was really excited to try Olive and Ivy.  The space is beautiful.  I do not even want to fathom how much money went into this place.  The dining room is a little on the large side for my taste, but it still maintains a dark intimate ambiance despite its size.  Now onto the disappointments - the food is all quite good.  Very high quality ingredients.  But....  it still managed to bore me.  I was looking forward to strong cheeses, spice, pungent flavors, a culinary adventure, a good mystery.  No adventure here.  It was more Disneyland than Greece or Portugal or whatever they attempted to reference.  And the service was deplorable. Truly bad.  I know the restaurant is still new, but I am not willing to cut it much slack considering the prices.  Haven't they heard of training?  I won't be rushing back.  My advice to Olive & Ivy?  Have a little more confidence in the people.  Be a leader.  Push the culinary boundaries of Scottsdale's palate.  We need some vision."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  And great service.  Ask for Rebecca next time you are in.  We even got to go cups for our drinks."}
{"text":"Good food and great service.  Except for the hostess.  Maybe her dog died, she was miserable.   She literally threw the menus down and trotted away without a \"hello\" or an \"enjoy your meal\"  That started us off on the wrong foot.   But our server(s) were great and we each ordered a different item and shared and everything was amazing.   Pretty expensive as the portions were not huge and we are a bunch of Italians, so we are used to making enough to feed an army.  But, hey, this is Scottsdale ...   It was VERY loud, don't go there for an intimate, quiet date. Go there if you want tasty food, brought out quickly from the kitchen."}
{"text":"The ambiance here can't be matched and this is one of the restaurants I go to for special occasions. There is almost no restaurant I love to sit outside under nice trees with sparkly light more. It seems pretentious from the outside but the servers are quite down to earth, attentive and the food is artesian and really everything I like in a dining experience. I love their focaccia bread with pesto dip starter (yes, it's free party peeps). The bread is soft and spongy and the pesto is delicious. I've had all sorts of things here as I've been a patron for over 10 years (now that I'm 25 lol!, I hope that admission doesn't age me). My favorite dishes: mushroom and fennel sausage white sauce flat bread, cheese and meat tray, pastas, and pretty much anything I order. The ice tea is wonderful too. We like coming here for brunch, happy hour, after shopping at fashion square, at night, for dates, pretty much anytime we are in the neighborhood. If you like this restaurant please look up FOX RESTAURANTS. Being the foodie I am, I pretty much love all of them. They have figured out the right recipe for great concept restaurants with delicious food. Yes, I am an unabashed Fox fan. Now I'll stop waxing poetic as I think my love for Olive and Ivy has been fully expressed."}
{"text":"12 of us from the Cloud LGS team visited Olive and Ivy this afternoon and they did not have a problem accommodating us at such short notice. The ambience was relaxing and open. the patio area is gorgeous and directly on the canal.   The service was wonderful and patient with such a large group.   If you like bruschetta then you should try a mix and match of their selections. Side note, the mushroom one tasted a little funky.  Overall we loved the experience."}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch here with friends that also happen to be business associates (that's the best way to do business - makes things easier).  I have been here many times and Olive & Ivy is always a solid choice. The ambiance is stunning (and only to get better once the patio renovation is completed), the food is delicious and the service is always top notch.    I recommend the sweet potato cannelloni and the roasted beet salad very highly.  Easy to order both and share between two people - that way you can taste a little of each and still be more than satisfied.  Now onto the wine.  If you are a white wine fan, you MUST order the Chenin Blanc.  I'm not kidding.  It's fantastic and a great value.  At $7/glass, you might think it will be terrible.  Wrong!  It's the value play on the menu.  Every restaurant has one - it's up to you to find it....and here it is.  Crisp and light.  Perfect, easy and drinkable....sounds just like the date you had on match last night, eh? ;)"}
