{"text":"Surprisingly a really good place. Split bar and restaurant is nice because of the smoking in bar area. Philly Cheese Steak was great!  Staff was friendly and attentive. Great pricing as well."}
{"text":"Had some potato skins today which were disgustingly dried out. This location is adjacent to a hotel so I knew better but figured how hard are potato skins. Frozen shells and burnt out dried out cheese told me the kitchen struggled hard with this simple request. I let the bartender know we were not happy, no compensation but she offered to send us something else. But at this moment I was thinking we got off lucky. Seriously think I could get food poisoning at this location. Never again cheap asses who don't care, I will spend my money somewhere else."}

I'm a very outgoing person but the bar tender is not. I asked for his name and he did not want to divulge. Yes!! I called him a lil bitch and he got defensive. I asked his name again and he got sensitive and I said to a bar standard how sensitive he was and the bar tinder took my drink away and closed me out. 
Having that said My waitress Rebecca (Becca) was the bomb, even though I had their Brat special and it took forever!! I definitely would not go there again."}
{"text":"I don't know why this was on yelp yet had no review This place is just off the beaten tourist path but is a supper cool local hang. First of all their is a bar area with lotsa of  tvs and lots of liquor so that you can check your bets and drink proportionatley according to your wins or loses. the bar and rest are modern and comfortable but still casual. i liked the fact that you could get a great steak a nicely done salad or a big fat hamburger . the fair is American and southwest and has a few Itallian items too!  Who new that there was a actually people oustide of the strip! prices are between 5- 20 bucks a deal,."}
{"text":"Now a Kopper Key chain bar & grill. Nice bar with typical food fare."}
