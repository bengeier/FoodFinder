{"text":"This place is AWESOME! We are super picky about sushi and decided to try a new place since we moved into a new house nearby and it was delicious! The Monica roll, Screaming o, and Raider roll were my favorites! Service was decent and the chefs were a lot of fun! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I found my new favorite Sushi spot! I love the originality and creativeness they put into each roll. The ingredients are very fresh and the sauces are superb! Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Found my new place. Used to come here when it was The Sushi but they went downhill. Anyway, love the Happy Hour specials and I don't do all you can eat much anyway so this is perfect. Great and fresh tasing and wonderful service. Will be back."}
{"text":"When this place was The Sushi the service and food were great. We were seated immediately at the bar but then had to get the attention of a server to get drinks. After ordering we waited again for a server to bring warm miso soup that was nothing but soy bean paste.

Never saw the server again, my drink ran out and asked for a refill twice from other servers and never got one. 

Asked for the check (from another staff member) and waited 10 minutes to get it..... If i was a dishonest person, i just would have left, the staff did not seem to notice us anyway."}
{"text":"So I'm not a fan of writing yelp reviews but I do believe this place deserves it. After seeing on here they have ayce sushi it was a lie!!!! Don't get me wrong sushi was amazing! The hulk roll was amazing and so fresh! I had same quality at sakana and it was ayce!! 60 bucks for 3 rolls and 2 nigiri!!! Great service though looks the same as when \"The Sushi\" was there it won't last unless it goes ayce that's the truth. I'm not saying the place is bad or anything trying to downgrade. But on here and other places it does say ayce sushi and I was on date I wasn't going to just leave and ruin my chances so I caved in and stayed!!"}
{"text":"If it's good quality creative sushi you are looking for then you have found the right place.  Their signature roll which features both hot and cold items in one roll has just the right amount of spice to tantalize the most critical of palate. The \"Miss Monica\" roll which features a semi-sweet sauce on the side is delightful to enjoy.  GET YOUR SUSHI ON!!!"}
{"text":"Not so great. We came here for lunch today only because we discovered that Naka Sushi (located just across the street) was closed on Tuesdays. There were only 2 tables occupied, the place was dead. Bad news is that Sushi Wabi is 30-50% higher priced than Naka, the menu was much weaker and the food wasn't nearly as good. Even the miso soup was thin and prepared poorly. I would encourage that owner and the cooks to eat at Naka, compare their respective quality and pricing then make some much needed internal changes if they want to stay in business."}
{"text":"Tl;DR This place has managed to get worse after going out of business and reopening. 
This used to be our go to for AYCE. The service was always a bit lax and nothing really stood out as being special. It was convenient and reliably mediocre. That was before they shut down as \"The Sushi\" and became \"Sushi Wabi\". It is obvious that all of their money was spent on rebranding rather than hiring a real sushi chef. The real red flag was when we asked about AYCE. We were told they do not do AYCE, but they would do it for us so we could try them. It was like pulling teeth trying to define the terms of AYCE vs. you can eat all you want. It was like being offered a bad drug for a discount in the hopes you will buy more before you leave full of shame and regret. After our waiter watched with care as our wannabe sushi chef made our ahi poke, he returned with what was truly the worst excuse for a tuna roll. Frankly the sheer lack of pride and or enthusiasm for what they do soured whatever chance they had to make at the very least an ok time. They get half a star for being open and they get the other half for being close to a few better sushi places."}
{"text":"Great place!!!  Awesome service.  The server went above and beyond to ensure we had a great meal.  Went back a second time with w/kids and they made roles just for them.  Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars, This place should called Sushi of Mexico ALL the employees are spanish which is OK, IF the sushi was on point. The rolls had way to much sauce also tasted bland. The fried calamari was in an oil sponge the side sauce was bad. UNI was good, hard to mess that up. Employees are nice and the check was correct. The background music was spanish at times. Im pretty sure we will not be going back to SUSHIMEX..."}
{"text":"This place lacks in costumer service. The food was delicious, but the poor service makes me not want to visit this restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"Such a good place. Sushi and tempura green tea ice cream was amazing! Definitely going to come back!"}
{"text":"Been here a few time now. This place is great. They are very generous with the cut of your sushi. I ate the cho-toro here and it's amazing. The price is very reasonable for a high end fish. The ocean trout is a wowzer, melts in your mouth. I'm definitely coming back to this place. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"Dont know if management is monitoring and deleting negative reviews, but previous reviews were dishonest and very misleading. My visit was a few months back, but other yelpers said it was AYCE which its not. I live quite far from here and the only reason I tried this place was because they were doing a 50% off all rolls deal. 

Service was friendly, but incredibly slow! We were the only table there and it took 20+ minutes for 3 rolls to come out. They were out of super white tuna so we ordered yellowtail which tasted strange. The water also tasted really off which I didnt drink after one sip and I will literally drink all restaurant water. 

The rolls were good but covered in sauce. I would say ask for all the sauce on the side. The one with the fried carrots on top was quite good. Another which I forget the name was not. I would only return if I was in the area and would only order a Monica roll!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Is all i can say! We just moved into this area and kept going to an old sushi spot! I can definitely say i have a new favorite spot!!! The sashimi had very thick slices which i love and their Monica, Raiders and Golden Knights rolls are amazing! A must try!"}
{"text":"First thing to notice is they are completely empty but we were starving and wanted sushi.

2nd....nobody of Japanese or even Asian descent works there. They are Hispanic. When I asked about this because it is quite odd, the server said it's quite common. I told her I've been eating sushi longer than she's been on the planet and have never ever seen a restaurant with no Japanese servers.

Four of us began to order and a sushi order can have 10-15 different items, but genius Myra thinks she can remember them. I specifically asked her to write them down but she refused. That's when I knew I should have walked out but was with others, and we were in three cars so to go elsewhere would have been complicated.

So genius Myra starts bringing sushi in plates of two. Nobody in this place has any idea that they should put ALL the sushi ordered on one plate, and bring the chicken dish, and bring the rice sides all at the same time.

So while the two men ate the sushi, the ladies just sat there watching them.

Then my veggie sushi arrived, avocado & cucumber, and the cucumber was ice cold while the rice and avocado were room temp making this a strange combo.  I ordered two rolls, but she only brought one.

Then long after all the food was served, I'm like, Myra, where's my Miso soup?? Where's my fried rice. She brought the soup and said the rice was cooking.

After we were ALL finished eating, I said, hey Myra, where is my fried rice? She answered, oh it's cooking elsewhere.  Yeah ok Myra.

I totally call her out on forgetting two of my items because she didn't write them down and she has no reaction to this. She doesn't care at all. No apology. Just a blank stare.

No way no thanks.
The only benefit of this visit was to confirm my intuition that as soon as we were waited on my a non Japanese person and she refused to write out order down, this dinner was doomed."}
{"text":"Services is outstanding,  the Pocky roll is a must,  spicy chicken, Pimp my roll,  tiger roll,  teriyaki roll,  scallop crunch roll... And open Christmas day !!"}
{"text":"I come here every week. They consistently make incredible sushi, flavor, quality of fish, the ingredients used. It's clear they're putting an amazing amount of effort. The sushi chefs are attentive, open to experimenting with ingredients and variations on the rolls in the menu. The wait staff is very friendly and proactive."}
{"text":"This place deserves a 5 star. Great food and great service. I came here with my husband and three kids and we order fresh fish and a few rolls. We order fatty tuna, salmon, ocean trout, and some other stuff. They are really generous on the cuts of fish. Thats what sushi should be. And it's really fresh fish. They even have fresh wasbi which alot of places dont have. But its different still good. It's interesting that every workers are spanish but who cares they sure know how to serve Sushi, lol. The pricing is not bad at all. This place is definitely our new fav."}
{"text":"Most wonderful experience! The food and service were excellent! I was impressed! The garlic tuna was amazing! All the rolls were fresh and full of flavor! The restaurant was clean with a lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"Sushi is spot on. We have been looking for a new spot since Sushi Fever started to decline. Rolls are high quality and large. Try the Raider and Nicole role."}
{"text":"I recommend this place .. the service is good ...the fish is very fresh .. the tuna very delicious, first time I come to this place and everything is very good ... you have to try the red rock roll."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It replaced, \"The Sushi\" and since its opening I believe in October my fiancé and I have become regulars! The price for the quality of sushi is fantastic! Typically I can only do one roll and prefer to not do all you can eat, and these rolls definitely do the trick! Specifically, I have had the Raiders Roll and the Miss Monica Roll, which were both phenomenal. As well as garlic tuna and yellowtail nigiri which both melted in my mouth, it was so good! 

Sushi chef and owner Nico does a great job interacting with his customers and delivering quality fresh fish that he personally picks up and checks out everyday. His attention to detail and the amount of flavor he has in each of his roles is insane! You can tell he is all about quality control and only serves the best. 

Also, don't let the yelp reviews fool you. The first week we went in this place was slammed, and everyone appeared happy and satisfied. There's something up with yelp because a couple of months ago this place had 4.5 deserved stars and I checked back recently to see they have removed majority of those for some reason. So what's up with that yelp?! 

Regardless, I hope future customers come to enjoy the deliciousness that is Sushi Wabi! Recently, our other go-to sushi bar Kabuki in Tivoli Village closed but we are happy to have Wabi to fill the void. Nico is an amazing chef and owner and everyone should check this place out, you won't regret it!

Oh and the dollar signs are off this is not a $$$ restaurant is very affordable at $$ signs!!"}
{"text":"food wasnt to bad. but it waa expensive since they have no ayce..tried to use the 10$ off coupon you get from yelp when you check in but they refused to use it. said they put in a 20% off coupon for the grand opening. however thr 20% off was only 6$ yet they still refusex to use thr 10$ off instead."}
{"text":"We recently discovered this place and have been coming at least once a week since. We absolutely love the creativeness and the burst of unique flavors you get with each roll. There is no need for soy sauce or wasabi! The fish is high quality and everything we have tried has been equally delicious. The service is awesome, efficient and the whole restaurant is consistent everytime we come it. Very well priced for what you get. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Super quaint, attentive staff, and amazing food.  Secret little gem.  We love this place"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed in my experience as a whole. I saw people were raving about this place and needed to see for myself. My friends and I went last night, not busy at all. One of my friends got there a few minutes before the rest of us, sat in a booth when we arrived neither waitress came to greet our table for roughly 20-25 minutes. I made eye contact as a 'hey we need something' gesture and still nothing. However they did acknowledge the fact we stood up and reseated ourselves at the sushi bar. Service was still extremely slow but at least we were being helped. Once the food started to come out and we finally had drinks the experience began to turn around. All and all the food was quite good but we couldn't get past the fact that beginning portion of the meal was so lack luster. Even when it came for the check, she set it on the table. I had my card in hand ready to pay for the entire meal to make it simple and nothing. She walked away. My boyfriend got up and followed her so we could just get out of there. I've worked in many areas of the service industry and what we went through last night was some of the most piss poor service I have experienced. Unfortunate since we live right here also."}
{"text":"I am a connoisseur of quality sushi and for this very reason I DO NOT DO All You Can Eat. Why? Because unbeknownst to most, there is a major drop in the quality of the product. It's awesome to know that this spot now has premium quality rolls. So far, every roll I ordered was perfection. My recommendations are the Miss Monica & Wabi Roll. Outstanding! Let the haters hate with their fake reviews. Go and experience this for yourself!!!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Kept hearing about this from NextDoor so thought we would give it a try to support our neighbors. Waiter could not answer questions about the menu so tried guessing. When it was obvious that he was guessing I suggested he ask what a particular item was ra ther than guessing. He seemed nice but should definitely learn the menu and items before working in a restaurant where many may have questions. There were three of us- I pointed at the item on the menu and even asked if the soup (Pork Ramen) came with noodles. Waiter thought that Tonkasu and apparently ordered that. Another ordered Chicken Teriyaki plate. Came with miso soup and small salad. Chicken Teriyaki comes plain on the plate- a sliced piece of white meat chicken with sauce on it- not even a garnish on the plate. Also ordered a special roll with spicy tuna and a few other things in it. Had Gyoza which were acceptable but rather burnt and took over twenty minutes to arrive. The waiter never came to refill our waters. He would disappear and then someone else would ask if everything was ok but it wasn't since we did not get our food or got served the wrong items FOUR times. I NEVER GOT what I ordered. The manager came over to try to help out but simply would go back and bring out something awhile later which was not what we ordered but apparently what the waiter ordered. It was a disaster. During one of the times the manager came by I told her about the NextDoor and she said she would take off 25% for that. Later, after getting the wrong food four times and me never getting my order she took 20% off the check ( gyoza, chicken teriyaki and special spicy tuna roll) which was still $30.00 for only two of the three of us getting our meal. POORLY HANDLED TO SAY THE LEAST. SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMPED FOR WHAT WE WENT THROUGH. NO- NEIGHBORS- I DON'T PLAN ON RETURNING."}
{"text":"I have never, ever, walked out of a restaurant before... ever.  Went for a quick bite and went to a place we love by our house... \"The Sushi\" was amazing: great chefs, good ambiance, fantastic service.  Tonight the door had a new sign, but same menu which was suspect.  The place was very loud and busy, like a family and friends party at the bar.  We got our drinks (water) and ordered a couple AYCE items.  Seaweed salad and gyoza were fine, but once our nigiri came out (not exactly what we ordered but hey, close enough) we still were waiting on plates, wasabi, soy sauce, etc. We attempted multiple times to flag anyone down to no avail (just to ask for some plates and wasabi) but were awkwardly avoided.

No kidding 15 minutes goes by and we're still trying to flag someone down the whole time.  The nigiri is just sitting there while waving and attempting to flag down anyone working.  15+ minutes with no service at an AYCE is terrible.  Empty waters, no service, nothing to eat our sushi with.  Meanwhile the party at the bar continues with the chefs doing shots with friends at the bar.  Our maybe waiter who greeted and sat us was polite and running around trying to keep up with the 4-5 other tables, but continued to avoid us even after saying he would be \"right back\" 15 or so minutes after we flagged him down. 

Bottom line, this place needs to get their game together if they want to stay open.  As locals, we'll never go back.  It's too bad \"The Sushi\" closed and was replaced by this joke."}
{"text":"Great food and I like the new owner and staff. If you ate at the sushi, you will enjoy much better quality."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant with amazing food .
They offer delivery with EAT24 and GrubHub ...
The food was delivered extremely fast on 11 miles from the restaurant !
Definitely will   Order again !!
Thanks Sushi Wabi"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Finally found the Bermuda Triangle where all of the former Sushi Fever chefs landed. Nothing but quality! We found our new sushi home!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place as we passed by today. There were plenty of parking, and kind of hidden, not a busy area and across from Savers and Big Lots. As we walked in, I noticed the place was very quiet even though it was a weekend. They were only 2 customers on the bar at 6pm. Suprisingly the food wasn't bad.

The menu was limited and majority of 2 pages of sushi were fried. If you like your sushi fried this would be a good place. We felt this place wasn't as authentic because we are used to more unique Japanese food. The sushi we ate were actually pretty fresh. 
We had Jt and Lee's Special roll. Also Smelt roe and Tempura Udon soup. The soup comes with a salad. Their house sake was hot, no cold sake.

I didn't check in on Yelp but I noticed later there is a $10 off on $45.

Overall the service was great. Btw, there is not an AYCE menu."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good place to get sushi for dinner and found this place on Yelp. SO. GLAD WE CAME!!! Great sushi! Great prices! and Great staff! The Shef created this for a friend a I and it was AMAZING"}
{"text":"Wow. This place has the best sushi by far. My friends and I came to Sushi Wabi because we heard that Chef Nico is now here. Get the Sting Man roll and the Red Rock roll!"}
{"text":"The Japanese Lasagne roll was delicious, filled with a ton of crab meat. My waitress Jen and the two chefs at the Sushi Bar: Niko and Esteban (I hope I spelled those right!) were awesome at checking up on me while not being overbearing."}
{"text":"Holy cow is this place fun. Great for large groups. While there are a lot of sushi places in Las Vegas, this one is near our house so we thought we give it a try... We have been back several times. Some very interesting rolls that are simply unlike anything else in town. Very affordable prices and great service"}
{"text":"Fantastic is all I can say! The New York roll was awesome! Happy hour specials are great and you don't have to sit at the bar to take advantage of the specials."}
{"text":"I was visiting Las Vegas and went here thinking it was The Sushi which was an awesome place. When we got there I saw the name had changed but decided to give it a try. Service was Meh. Food was worse. Everything was just kind of room temperature. I like my sushi to be colder than they served. It just felt kind of gross attempting to eat warm sushi. Over all the sushi was rather tasteless and the miso soup left a lot to be desired. I definitely won't return. I will stick to my usual sushi place, Naked Fish. A little further away, flamingo and Durango but worth it."}
{"text":"This place is no good and I think it shows as we came in to an empty restaurant.  I would say the sushi spot across the street by the dance studio is better.

This place used to have a different name but is now called Sushi Wabi, the only spot used to be AYCE but Sushi Wabi is NOT AYCE anymore.  No big deal, my favorite sushi place in Vegas isn't AYCE.  

We literally had the option to sit anywhere but maybe two tables in the restaurant because it was slow on a weekend dinner service.  Throughout service we'll find out why.  

They bring out cucumber as an appetizer but ours had random stuff on it from the cooks glove from a different sushi or prep.  They weren't on top of water or soda refills throughout the evening.

One of my order wasn't made until all of our other dishes were served because the cook could not read the servers handwriting.  I think the server was more on a rush to clock out than complete the food service.  So the late order was a banked roll.  It came out with the cream cheese still in a block and the middle of the roll still cold.  Maybe the cook was in a rush to get out an incomplete meal because we were waiting awhile for it.

The scallop nigiri tasted OLD and the sauce they serve with the gyoza was more tart and tangy that what I'm used to.  The California roll also was more MAYO than crab meat.  Sushi Wabi needs to get their act together.

I wouldn't suggest coming here."}
{"text":"Our first visit was in February and pleasantly pleased. They don't have all you can eat but that they will make your sushi the way you want. Since then I have eaten there two more times. We got some great service and fresh fish. I found my sushi placr"}
{"text":"Excellent quality sushi! I give a solid four star because of the quality of the food. Only down fall is no AYCE and they are a little slow."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm kids screaming, service not so great, but I had to laugh; as the previous review was correct. It's like Mexican Sushi  the chefs and staff speaking Spanish. Just seemed odd at a sushi place 
It tasted ok, no specials, menu is nothing unique. 
Beer was good !"}
{"text":"Great fresh sushi! Awesome prices! The Coustomer service is amazing definitely will recommend! 
Come for happy hour!!"}
{"text":"Ate here tonight and it was awesome.  High quality fresh fish, good portions, quality service.  I am from out of town and I am a sushi snob.  I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I rather eat Sushi from Smith, this Sushi was the worst I have ever had    
rolled incorrectly and made it wrong, it even look like crap,  rookie chef better go back to school. ( I know Japanese food part of my heritage). I will never ever go back there, should have turn around seeing a Sushi place empty, the atmosphere was a joke. Use to be a Mexican resturant before and Nico does not know how to make Sushi at all.. and the server had enough cologne on him to make me sick. We could not wait to get out of the resturant, stay away it wannabe Sushi place  :-("}
{"text":"Ordered the sashimi platter to go. Every single piece was delicious and fresh! Presentation was very nice! Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"I love this place and Nico. The fish is fresh. The vibe is fantastic and the happy hour is great. Every time I go there, I feel welcome. Awesome customer service from the moment I walk in."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had and I've had a lot of sushi in my day.. would definitely try the red rock roll"}
{"text":"Sushi is good, nothing special. Waitress for happy hour has the personality of a rock. There are
Plenty of other places in the area, do your research and try elsewhere that appreciates your business."}
{"text":"This is second time we've eaten here.  Food is good but out last visit was a disappointment because the service was terrible. Even though we went during lunch hour, there were only a few people there. Our waiter was MOA most of the duration of our time there. We had to ask more than once for eating utensils.  Original ginger and wasabi wasn't enough for one person, let alone two.  We had to ask for more.  It took awhile to get our food, but it was good.  Waiter kept going to back of restaurant so if we needed anything we had to wait until he came forward.  No offers to refill drinks.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We went to Sushi Wabi last night for the first time.  It was an incredible evening of great sushi, good personal service, and reasonable prices. We had the \"I Love Jane\" roll, the \"Linda\" roll, \"Screaming Orgasm\", Halibut with spicy ponzu, Yellowtail, Blue Fin Tuna, and shrimp.  All were exceptional.  They do not offer AYCE which has evidently disappointed some people.  However, we prefer a higher end sushi experience and Sushi Wabi was it.  If you sit at the bar, the chefs will do their best to accommodate your requests. Don't be shy.  Tell them what you like. 

Sushi Wabi exceeded our expectations and it will be our new sushi favorite....and we live in Henderson!"}
{"text":"I am very happy every time I come to this establishment 
why,  because I feel welcome 
And the price s very good for the quality
That they have Nico is very friendly 
And very creative thumbs up wabi"}
{"text":"This place is so expensive for the quality they serve I ate yesterday it was my first and last day ever the fish no fresh at all they almost put on my sushi some dry black tuna left from the bar so I asked the nice guy to change it and he saw from the beginning it was an old fish piece don't ever do that I will complain about it I ate two rolls and 28 dollars it's worth much more or at least fresh food not old fishes plus the place always alone"}
{"text":"Can I give them zero stars? Where to begin? This was our second visit and will be our last. The place was empty when we arrived (it was empty last time too -- hmmmm). I ordered sashimi which came out relatively quickly. My husband ordered a hot dish which took probably 20+ minutes to come out. When it did, the rice was cold, the soup was cold and the meat was dry. The waiter had just started yesterday so he wasn't quite on board yet. The \"piece de resistance\" was that they couldn't get the POS system to work. Normally we pay by credit card but fortunately we had enough cash to pay the check. My husband is normally a big tipper but he barely left anything. Needless to say, we won't be returning. Go there at your own peril!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is incredible every time we come the tuna and all the fish is fresh I recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Sushi all of the sushi is big and enjoyable not small comes with a really nice portion and the sauce on each one is delicious thank you Brian Brandon."}
{"text":"Wow! What an unexpected surprise! I am pretty snobby about where I dine out for sushi here in Vegas but a friend asked me to try this place out and it's very close to the house. Nothing fancy but the freshness of the fish and the portions are very generous. I'm huge on sashimi and not usually a guy that goes for sushi rolls but after seeing some of the plates that went out to the tables I had to try a couple of rolls... and they were delicious! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone living in the Summerlin area, you will not be disappointed!!! I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"First time to this establishment.. and the atmosphere is a bit quiet, and empty.. there was plenty of staff and one sushi chef for the amount of business on this evening. 

The food was fresh, and accurate to the table..

I would have given five stars if the waiter(s) would have been more attentive to fill our water glasses.. and stopped by to check on things!"}
{"text":"Tried this establishment out. Did takeout. It's suitable flavors and most dishes taste like what you'd expect.  I didn't have anything that stood out as a WOW, but for an everyday Japanese Restaurant, it passes the test. I would return to this place in the future."}
{"text":"The young man who was the greeter/server seemed more concerned with acting cool and casual than providing good service. The sushi was good but the server is doing a disservice to the restaurant. I ordered 3 things and he forgot to bring me two of them. I wish it was AYCE. I know that may be faux pas but with the quality of sushi at the other AYCE sushi places and plus better service, it's not worth eating at Sushi Wabi in my opinion for the price."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in town, strip or off.  Nico, the owner, will make special rolls on request and is a friendly face to meet you whenever you walk in. I won't go anywhere else for sushi Summerlin or adjacent again."}
