{"text":"I wish I still lived on the East End. This place was a staple of my diet, sometimes going 3 times a week (a lot more locals go more than that). Why go so much? Reasonable prices, variety of menu, predictability of preparation, friendliness of staff. Even now I live in Parkdale and see nothing wrong with taking the 504 all the way to the other side of the city if it means I will get breakfast at this place and then hit the farmers market at either Evergreen Brick Works or Withrow Park. If you go early you can have a peaceful and quick meal too. 9AM was too late for me, and on the weekends when the brunch kids wake up there can be a line-up for the patio, I would be long out of there."}
{"text":"Best eggs Benny I've had so far in the city and I have had them in a lot of places."}
{"text":"Used to be a good cheap greasy spoon breakfast place, unfortunately, not a deal anymore.  I just went there for breakfast, and noticed that the prices went up.  It's still affordable, but since \"greasy\" is the key word here in my review,  I only enjoyed it because it was such a great deal.  For the new price, I'd rather go to a cleaner place with no \"soup nazi\" attitude."}
{"text":"One of my favourite breakfast joints when I lived on the Danforth. Food is simple, well made, and reasonably priced. Portions are on the large side. Their take-out pizza is actually very, very good but the pricing can be inconsistent. \"Mama\" charges full price for toppings when only applying it to half the pie where as \"Daughter\" pro-rates. The difference in price can be $5 to $8 depending on the size of pie and number of toppings. Would be nice if they got on the same page. (Note: I have not idea if they are actually related, it is just how my room mate and I used to identify them, \"Who served you Mama or Daughter?\"). Oh! Their take out burger special with fries is very hearty and reasonably prices as well ($5 or $6)."}
{"text":"This review is based just on the breakfast.  It's a busy place but the turnover is pretty quick and the prices are right.  On weekdays coffee is included with the traditional breakfast.  The two times I've gone I ordered the traditional breakfast with bacon ($6.95).  It comes with 2 or 3 eggs (I can't remember which), home fries (after 12pm I've heard they serve Greek potatoes instead of home fries), toast (I prefer the rye), bacon (it comes with 4-5 pieces, very generous portion), and a few pieces of fruit.  When the plate first came out I was concerned it didn't look like enough food but it was, and trust me I can eat.  It is a great breakfast and is delicious; side note, ask for the hot sauce for your eggs.  My friend avoids potatoes and asks for tomato slices instead of home fries.  This is a typical diner with consistent food for a reasonable price.  The service is standard, quick and to the point to get you in and out.  I do love that they ask if you want separate bills.  I love this place."}
{"text":"A wonderful place for a less expensive sit down meal; breakfast, lunch or dinner. There are many upscale places along the Danforth that offer fine dinning and ambiance. But if you are just looking for family friendly dinning you can't beat the value offered at the New Yorker. For a bacon and eggs special no one can compete with the New Yorker. Recommend also the souvlaki dinner."}
{"text":"5 stars is my bias review for being my local greezy breakfast joint.  But I give 3 stars because there is really nothing terribly special about the place.  The service is excellent and the staff really hustle on weekends when the place is packed for breakfast.  The decor is way out-dated and they should really just give the place a face-lift without trying to change the image.  I always get bacon and eggs.  The bacon is good, a little thicker than most places.  Three eggs and your choice of home fries or Greek style roasted (with oil and lemon). Decent coffee but no espresso/latte/etc. Good price/value and worth checking out if you don't already have a local greasy spoon."}
{"text":"Great Eggs Benedict.  I like the coffee as well.  Polite people.  They work hard and fast.  The place can get busy and noisy, only because it's popular.  I like the food.  Happy with their offering.  But, would be nice if they updated either their posted business hours, or actually arrived to open at 7am.  I'm often up in the morning and expect to sit at 7am as they have posted.  40 minutes late, arriving one by one all knowing it's late, is unacceptable.  If you open at 8, then say you open at 8.  It's important to keep online information relevant, otherwise you piss off your return customers until they stop coming back."}
{"text":"No frills dinning at the corner of Broadview and Danforth. Been here several times over the last couple years for their all day breakfast. Always been good, always been simple."}
{"text":"I got a Home made beef burger. It was big enough for me at that time. Beef patty was a bit harder than I was expecting. I think not because too much fried. I guess it just because \"100%\" beef one. Taste is not bad, I ate it after I added mayo though. Became better..  They also serve seldom breakfast menus in reasonable price.So, I'll try it next time:)"}
{"text":"Literally the worst breakfast I've ever had. The coffee was cold, the \"home fries\" were just flavorless unseasoned potatoes, the sausages tasted cheaper than cheap, the eggs were over cooked, and the bread was under toasted and texturally dense. I've never had a \"worst breakfast I've ever had\" experience before this. It was so unenjoyable it was almost impressive."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 9 on a Monday at  9:30 a.m.  Everyone was amazed at the value of their diner style breakfasts.  I had two eggs over easy (perfect), home fries (more like D-shaped french fries, but good) and brown toast (standard wonder bread) and tea for 4.20.  (With meat is 4.80)  A friend had a dish, the name of which I forget, but it contained pancakes, 2 eggs, bacon, ham and sausage for about 7 bucks.  As eh B. says, you don't go for fine dining, but such a deal!"}
{"text":"I have been going to NYC for years +years now. Over the past 2 years it has gradually worsened with baaad service and the food is not a patch on how it used to be. The new menu is lame.  I ordered Mousaka and it came solo. No salad, no nothing. Just mousaka. But hey it was ok I guess. My friend ordered a burger....I guess she assumed it came with fries. Nope! You have to order them now and pay extra. The place is really really divey now. But not just that= its looking dirty.  Come on guys...vacuum the carpet!!!!"}
{"text":"The New York Cafe was my go-to hangover brekky joint when I lived in the east end. Prices were dirt cheap and you could always rely on a massive portion of almost anything you ordered.  Prices have gone up a lot since then and the menu has been scaled back. I took a star off for this.  It's also still a solid place to go for some greek/diner food.   There's a little patio out front that isn't much from an ambiance standpoint. While it does happen to be amazing for people watching, it's also a prime target for bums who want money or to gawk at your food. Depending on your leanings the latter may be entertainment or a severe annoyance--that's for you to decide.  Liver and Onions are a fave of mine. The peameal is the thickest I've ever seen and if you want straight up greaseball, the french fries and onion rings can't be beat. The coffee is actually pretty good here. I'm a hardcore espresso drinker and I can't drink regular coffee most of the time. But theirs is nice and strong.  This place is reliable east-end greasy spoon."}
{"text":"Been going to NY Cafe for close to 20 years for that cheap good greasy breakfast but I have to say, I'm a little disappointed in the increase in prices. The only difference is the limited menu and a couple of pieces of fruit on the plate. I don't eat the meat, and asked for tomato in place of the meat. \"that will be extra\" Say what? You're going to charge me for a couple of slices of tomato? There are too many great breakfast places close by to get charged like that for every little extra."}
{"text":"This was the morning of the blackout from the Ice Storm. My friend took me to breakfast as I had no power. I treated him to breakfast. My breakfast was ok, his was not! His Eggs Benedict were less than stellar. The peameal bacon was thick and fatty and his eggs had egg shells. My friend told the waitress who's response was: oh well it's busy and I guess they are not paying as much attention to what they are doing. Really?! Then she says she will take it off our bill. Of course you will!! I felt bad for my friend."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I couldn't even eat solid foods.   Pretty solid and standard place. The food hasn't changed much over 20 years. I've only gone here for brunch and it's pretty hard to mess that up. I always get the 3 egg breakfast. Good amount of home fries that are sprinkled with salt and some red stuff (it's pretty good). Eggs are always over easy. Bacon is a must. This is hit or miss. Can be crispy some days, but most days it's not too crispy. Toast is toast.  We know the waitresses at this place, so they're always pretty nice. I really recommend this place if you're hung over. They really give you a lot of food (carbs), it's pretty cheap, and it's pretty quiet unless you get a rowdy family with 5 jits up in the mix. Let's hope that doesn't happen to you."}
{"text":"We came across the New York Cafe while walking around looking for a brunch place. The New York Cafe is a no-frills greasy spoon diner and I think that's what makes it great! They've got seating indoors and a few tables on the outside. Their menu is simple - a good selection of breakfast items like omelettes, eggs/bacon/toast and pancakes, etc. We came by on a Saturday around 12PM so we didn't have to wait for a table. There were plenty of servers who came by regularly to make sure we had enough coffee. The portion sizes were good for the prices they were charging and I was happy with my pancakes - light and fluffy! I noticed a lot of what seemed like regulars coming in for take out so I thought that was a good sign. Overall, I thought the New York Cafe was a good choice for a fuss free place to get brunch!"}
{"text":"Dinner: Overcooked wings, Caesar salad drenched in dressing but missing cheese & bacon bits, water tasted salty and the ice cubes tasted like the freezer, mixed up the order, one waitress on a Friday night"}
{"text":"Highly recommend the pork souvlaki dinner!  Good luck if you can finish it all with room for dessert."}
{"text":"this is way overdue. and yes i carry a grudge.  the new york café is one of the worst run restaurants i have ever encountered in my 45 years of eating in restaurants.  in that 45 years i have been fed by greeks probably more by a vast majority than any other ethnicity. the greek people are masters of hospitality and the world knows it. there are greeks running restaurants the world over. i could write a book about the great and wonderful greek people who have fed me for years on end and still do today. hell i live in greektown.  so what is with the new york cafe? i have never met a more inconsiderate management that somehow keeps some very nice servers and makes average food for an average price. [i reckon their location in a high traffic area is about 85% responsible for their longevity.]  so here it is: i was a regular for years. i am talking 10-12 years ever since kringles three doors over closed run by the lovely greek woman effie. i had breakfast at least 5 days a week at the new york. many times 7 days a week. i also used to bring my young kids 2-3 times a week for supper, with me for breakfast and weekend lunches etc.  that kind of loyalty usually engenders loyalty back. well here is the type of place the new york café is:  the kind of place where even if you do not take potatoes or toast with your breakfast - ever and for years - but they charge you 15 cents when a child wants another jam. [i kid you not. i even called the lovely waitress on it and she blushed with embarrassment and told me she had to because they watch.]  the kind of place that changes policies weekly and sometimes daily: one day offers of a free coffee refill, the next day doesn't and then doesn't tell you and charges you $1 for the refill.  the kind of place that then allows no refills but a free 'warm up' of your coffee and then decides it was really a refill and charges you $1 for that even when you are telling the waitress - a family troll who only robs customers on the weekends - that she should stop pouring. [that was the last straw.]  the kind of place that would lose my business over $1. [i was there with my wife that time and she went over to the manager giotta explained how it was wrong and giotta sided with the family troglodyte and kept the $1 charge. no word of a lie.]  i figured in the 6-7 years i have stopped eating there they have lost tens of thousands of dollars. $6-$7 a day for brek times 300+ days a year. family meals 2-3 times a week probably worth $25-$30 a meal.   this all said i have to give kudos where they are deserved:   the new york café is the kind of place that will give you a free breakfast when a cockroach crawls over your table or on the wall next to you. that happened a half dozen times at least - and oddly never once in any other restaurant i have been too that i can remember. [i did see a mouse in chinatown downtown about 20 years ago i recall.]  my current breakfast place, yep greek run, never stops pouring coffee and on their own initiative started giving me an extra egg and extra slice of bacon because i never have potatoes or toast. that is hospitality. that is consideration. that is the mentality of success and where the new york café lost thousands this place has made it all in spades."}
{"text":"We were here once after a late night...the receipt says 5:41pm...back on January 11, 2015...how did we make it until after 5 before eating?!  Nothing fancy: bacon and eggs for $7.25 and a roast beef dinner for $10.95.  The food was enjoyed.    As mentioned below, this is one of those basic, no BS, honest, greasy spoon types of joints.  Greek owned and operated, with a corresponding menu, you can expect generous portions and good service.  Our waitress was great.  I'd like to drink a beer on the patio during the summer or return for breakfast at breakfast hours.    Nothing you need to journey for, unless you are trying to visit every diner like place in Toronto, but a great place if you are near Broadview and Danforth."}
{"text":"I've lived in Toronto 30 years and I can say now that I've had the worst breakfast in Toronto ever! Eggs easy over were runny and under cooked, the potatoes tasted like they were raw and the bacon tasted like strips of leather with salt. Even the two small pieces of fruit tasted like they were days old. My recommendation, keep walking, even starve until you find a better place. There were two of us and we both agreed that it was shite. We'll never return, ever."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of co-workers for lunch. Diner style restaurant on the Broadview & Danforth area. It has a patio, though being next to the Broadview subway station, the streetcars usually kill the mood.   My whole table ordered the fish & chips because one of my collegues boasted how great it was.  You get a choice of either 1 fish ($6.95) or 2 ($8.95). Comes with the usual coleslaw and fries (can be replaced with salad). Coming in a large and generous portion, I was glad I only ordered 1 fish and I have a big appetite.   The fish itself was a large piece, thick and juciy. Though it was a bit on the tough side. I'm a huge fan of coleslaw and the one that came with the meal won me over. Fries was also decent. I'm not overly excited about the fish & chips, but for the price, it's as good as it gets.   Service was quick and friendly. The only complaint is the cleanliness of the restaurant. Flies and fruit flies were flying around and it makes you feel queasy just wondering if the kitchen is sanitized. Carpet is never good and hard to clean, so you see food bits everywhere on the ground."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I usually order take out and get the chicken souvlaki on a pita with fries & gravy. The portions are big and the prices are affordable. It's quite busy on the weekends during brunch. From what I know this place has been around for a very long time.  I went for brunch and ordered the eggs Benedict. The peameal bacon and hollandaise source is outstanding! One of the best eggs Benny's I've had in Toronto so far. The home fries though we're dried out, hard and not that great. If I'm craving an eggs Benny or chicken souvlaki on a pita with fries and gravy this is the place I'd think of first to go to."}
{"text":"Rustic and home-fashioned meals, with a very simple yet appealing menu. The waiters and waitresses are very friendly and will seat you quickly. Interior could use some work but nobody seems to mind. There appears to be a lot of regulars who dine there, but everyone always seems to have a good time- many people order take-out as well. The food is pretty good, with pretty big portions. I will be trying their Eggs Benedict next time, I've heard they're the best around. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"Surprisingly few options for the Danforth neighborhood for breakfast before 10am.  This place is one of them.  A non-nonsense diner style family restaurant with the standard egg-centric options.  Hash brown are fresh, not frozen, but deep fried instead of griddle-top.  Coffee is above average for this type of venue, and service is typical Greek busy/friendly.  Pricing for the Danforth was decent- $28 for two.    Tip- go with their standard omelets, they have a decent variety (Western, Greek, 3-Cheese etc.) when you custom build an omelet, you pay a premium- $15 v $9."}
{"text":"The New York Cafe has been a long time staple on Broadview. I've depended on them for their onion rings, that saw me through many hang overs, and for just hearty, greasy-spoonish and cheap fare.   I hadn't been in over a year so I dropped in with a few friends.   The place looked the same (more on that later) and we were delighted to be handed brand new menus. Funny but on our way there, we commented to our friend, from out of area, how their menu never changes. Too bad we spoke too soon.  The menu is not only scaled back but there are a few changes, notably that now, if you order a burger or sandwich, you have to PAY EXTRA FOR FRIES. WTF?!! Who the hell charges extra for fries, that for years (and I do mean years) used to come with it - free of charge? I had the grilled chicken sandwich which was a big, honking piece of an actual chicken breast, not those horrid flat tasteless mystery meats. It was succulent and juicy but no onion. I guess now, that also comes with an added charge. A slice of onion? Really? Are things that bad?   So when all these what are now \"extras\" are added up, my trusty little place for a cheap meal, is no longer so cheap.  After our meal, one person commented on the decor, especially the crappy looking ceiling that could really use an overhaul. They changed the menu, not for the better, but not the decor which is looking very old and tired. If they are going to be charging these prices, the least they can do is spruce up the place.   Maybe it's under new management? All I know is, I was very disappointed and will probably avoid in future. There are so many restaurants in this area that look a lot nicer and don't stiff you for fries. Or onions. Tacky, tacky, tacky.  Send to a Friend Link to This Review Write an Update  Edit Remove"}
{"text":"Little breakfast joint in the Danforth and Broadview area.  Not cheap, standard breakfast/diner experience. When I visited, it's was 34 degrees out and there was no A/C. It was that unusual time of year where the systems were switched over but the heat was still crazy.   Ordered the Benedict with Peameal. It was ok at best. For some reason they serve this in an awkward ramekin which doesn't allow you to cut it properly. The eggs were delivered as ordered - soft. Peameal bacon was quite nice though. Had a nice thickness to it - which I appreciate. I can't stand super thin Peameal. Home fries were nothing to write home about.   Service was decent. Total bill with coffee after tax was about $14.   I've had better for less. That's why I can't justify a 4 star but - it's not bad."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon New York Cafe for a quick lunch on a Monday.  By quick I meant my parking meter was expiring in 40 minutes.  I ordered an In-House Roasted Beef Sandwich, no fries ($7.25).  It turned out I didn't need the fries.  The sandwich was a half submarine.  The roast beef was moist and fresh,  It was approximately half an inch thick.  The gravy was salty, making it tasty for dipping.  The bun could be fresher though.  In all, I enjoyed the sandwich.  It was good diner quality food at food court price.  It made a satisfying, delicious lunch.  I won't mind ordering it again.  The services was great.  There was only 1 waitress, and she was a real pro.  She wore a big smile.  I was greeted and seated promptly.  I told her I was in a hurry.  She acknowledged it, and a glass of water appeared on my table lighting fast.  The roast beef sandwiches arrived within 10 minutes.  When done, I asked for the bill, and it arrived within 3 minutes.  I walked back to my car, and the meter was not expired yet.   Sandwich alone 3 stars.  Services +0.5 stars.  Total 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 16 yrs, now live in NYC but always stop by for a vist when visiting family. Always get the pork souvlaki dinner with lemon potatoes, the full Greek experience. Amazing. Gyro dinner is great too, as well as moussaka. Have never had anything else. Huge portions, great prices. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this place for breakfast. I love it. Their peameal bacon is excellent, along with Egg Benedict, their sauce makes the difference and very good price."}
{"text":"Stopped by here tonight for dinner. It's a cozy place that was not too busy. Waitress was friendly. My wife had the lite chicken kabob meal and I had the club sandwich. The wait for the food was reasonable. The club sandwich was delicious and my wife said her chicken kabob was moist. Overall we were both impressed with the food. The price was also fair (22$ for food and a drink). One negative point is that the washrooms are in the basement and so not accessible by wheelchair."}
{"text":"went today for breakfast in a sort of rush, but didn't want to feel rushed (yeah, confusing).  both of us ordered traditional breakfast - 3 eggs, home fries, toast, fruit.  we both went with poached eggs (medium for my friend, soft for me), rye toast  the poached eggs were freaking perfect!  so many places don't do poached, and others make them badly.   no problem here.   the medium were medium - still bright yellow.   the soft were moist but not raw/runny.   rye toast went well with the poached  the fruit was a bit disappointing - 2 grapes, one small orange slice and a tiny piece of melon  the home fries were just that - potatoes, fried.   no crazyass herbs and spices messing them up  two breakfasts with tea - including tax/decent tip - the total was about $15 - kinda hard to beat that  attentive but not cloying service  New York Cafe hit the mark again   (and the steady flow of happy customers seemed to prove that it's still the standard there)"}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much from the outside and the inside isn't particularly fancy either but the food is great greasy spoon food that I crave on the weekends. The portions are generous and tasty. I highly recommend it for an all-day breakfast place along the Danforth."}
{"text":"Went for pizza. So delicious you'll whimper from the sheer joy of eating it. The extra large is not listed on the menu, but don't let that stop you from ordering it. So large it hangs over the side of the serving tray.   Note that they slow cook their pizza, so it takes 45 minutes to prepare. If you are going to eat there, phone in your order so they can start cooking it before you arrive. Trust me on this.  Good, friendly people. Nothing fancy here, just a great old-school family-run restaurant. An anchor of the neighbourhood for a long time."}
{"text":"I would like to acknowledge the girl that handled our delivery order on the evening of Thursday February 11th (around 9:30pm). We were having a tonne of trouble ordering through justeat.ca (they missed the order, said they placed it, then called again half an hour later saying they didn't place it) it was a nightmare. However this wonderful gem that worked at New York Cafe took the time to call me personally and make sure I was okay and happy. She even went as far as including a hand written note in our order wishing us a wonderful evening and apologizing for how the order went even though none of the problems had been because of her. I've been working in the hospitality business for over a decade and I really appreciated this above and beyond service. Food was good, but I will be returning for the service! :)"}
{"text":"I have passed this place for years and we were planning to go to a place beside this restaurant but we changed our minds and decided to try here. It was terrific. The place was buzzing with customers and the service was speeding along. I ordered a special of the day - roasted pork with scalloped potatoes and veggies and my boyfriend ordered pancakes. They were great! The neighbours at another table told us how they love the Western and the BLT.  We came back with a big group of friends for a brunch.  They were attentive.  The food was great and we had a great time.  PS. The Baklava is devine!"}
{"text":"disclaimer: came here completely on a whim(sp?)  anyways, this place looks like nothing much on the outside, which is fine because ive been shocked before.  the menu is fairly simple, and full of some \"neighborhood\" classics, such as greek flavored cuisine.  the quality of taste and flavor in the food literally knocked my socks off, and the price wasn't too bad either. i had the gyro dinner which was a massive portion to say the least, that left me very satisfied. the potatoes were perfect, and one of the best servings ive ever had the chance to eat.  highly HIGHLY recommend. i almost hate wanting to try other restaurants in this neighborhood, cause after this?  the bar is set PRETTY high"}
