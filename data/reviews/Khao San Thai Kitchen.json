{"text":"We stopped in this cozy little restaurant close to our hotel for an early dinner. The staff seemed a bit harried (I think they could have used an extra server), but other than having to remind them about our drinks, we had a lovely meal. The dumplings were delicious and shaped like little flowers. The meal itself was served family style and was very good. We had the beef panang curry and the pra ram long song. I preferred the pra ram long song, but my husband preferred the curry, so that was an even split! We have a number of excellent Thai places in our hometown, and this could stand up with them quite easily."}
{"text":"One of my new favourite restaurants in Calgary!

Great service, great decor, great tasting food, great presentation!

The spring rolls we ordered came served vertically in shot glasses with a small amount of dipping sauce at the bottom of each one! How cool!

I ordered the green curry and my partner ordered the yellow curry and both were amazing! Veggies were not overdone, and food was spicy but flavourful. Excellent.

The coconut ice cream dessert came with 4 interesting toppings including some that I couldn't identify but tasted great anyways.

I will definitely be back! 
(Perfect for a 1st or 2nd date, trying to impress but still quiet enough to hear conversation...)"}
{"text":"'It's pretty, nice outside street patio with comfortable looking seating,  and also comfy shimmer fabric covered bench and table & chair seating, gold embossed tapestries and chocolate brown wall curtaining  inside. Great metal and glass round light fixtures, 'sort of a warm coppery hue envelops you as you step in. The decor is modern and sleek and shiny and beautiful. The free green tea with coconut infusions in a French press is such a warm welcome. The staff are very friendly. Food arrives on time. I ordered \"Drunken seafood spaghetti\" and a Papaya salad w. prawns. The Papaya salad could also be vegetarian if you like. They have several good vegetarian choices. The Thai beer that washed down my smoking hot choices reminded me a wee bit of my new import beer addiction, \"Innis & Gunn.\" It was Friday nite around 8PM and there were some tables still to be had but not many, 'always new dinner arrivals at the door waiting to be seated. The hostess recommended our reservations when I inquired earlier.  The diners are hip, younger, 'know what they like, and all seem to love authentic Thai as it is presented here. My tummy is getting older and the little Chillies were kicking  it's lining. The waiter brought  me a slice of dry bread at my suggestion to give me some reprieve as I continued munching! 'So much for gluten free as per their advertising! That miraculous plain slice made my tears subside abit. The evening was perfect, 'only suggestion might be that they do indicate the heat factor of each dish. Ask if you're like me! I went with a girlfriend and she had a green coconut curry w. chicken that worked well with her recent diet. I give this new find big thumbs up."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai Restaurant! Way better than anything else in Calgary.  Thai Iced Coffee and Thai Iced Tea have authentic flavours to Thailand!

Best part of the meal is the ingredients were fresh! Kaffir Lime Leaves, lemon grass, galangal, all true flavours of Thailand were present in the dishes.  The Tom soups were spicy, love the heat, and very flavourful.  They give you generous portions of coconut rice.  The braised short rib was extremely tender and delicious.  The panang curry was rich in flavour.  I ended up ordering more rice to mop up the curry sauce.  Mango Sticky rice could use more palm sugar for sweetness. I prefer my sticky rice for dessert served cold, they serve it warm which was a unique taste.  Still a pleasant way to end dinner!

I highly recommend this place. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Fantastic food & wonderful service - a winning combination. The staff were very friendly and attentive. We stayed later than we meant to (the owners were starting to lay out their own dinner) but they never asked us to leave - they even explained some of their own traditional dishes. The food was very good; not the absolute best Thai food I've ever eaten, but the decor and service bumped it up"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere , great service, and great tastes. Be sure to ask for the condiment tray, to boost the heat, beyond what is normally served.
My stomach isn't big enough to have eaten a lot of dishes, but the pa nang was delicious and my neighbors sa Khoo looked really good. Leave room for dessert. The tapioca pearl is a perfect sweet finish. 
Pan is an excellent host making everyone feel a little bit of Thai hospitality"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what all of the hype is about this place.
It is quite overpriced for thai food and I didn't really enjoy our food.
I had the pad thai which was lacking a good sauce, any form of heat and wasn't very substantial. The wife had the braised short ribs in a curry sauce which was ok. I have had the same beef dish in multiple restaurants and the beef normally falls apart just with a  fork. This beef was a bit too tough. 
We sat on the small patio which was nice and cozy and the service was very good as well. I'll probably try and check out a different thai place as a go to though."}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai I have ever had, when I want Thai food I go here.
Great service, they had reservations booked up but still allowed us to order, food came out very quick and we were in and out, not rushed, before their reservation came in for their table. 

I will be going here again and again."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai meals we've had!! #khaosanthaikitchen #padthai at Khao San Thai Kitchen"}
{"text":"Great service and cozy atmosphere. My first Thai place in Calgary. We tired the dumplings, short ribs and a chicken curry. Make sure you reserve before going, specially with large groups."}
{"text":"Good renditions of Thai classics...the menu includes both everyday and royal cuisine. If you like spicy, this place won't hold back when asked.  Dishes are about the same price as other Thai restaurants in town, but Khao San edges most of them out on flavour. White Elephant in the North-East is still my favorite, but for downtown this is probably my new go-to Thai spot.

Service was friendly and fast.  We were out of there in about 45 minutes, even though we had mains and dessert.  The patio has about 5 tables, so you can have Thai AND people watch on 17th.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place receives any good review. The food is passable at the best. I ordered a few common Thai dishes. Pad Thai noodle was overcooked and flavor is not fully developed. The chicken piece is tasteless and definitely is from frozen chicken breast. The seafood curry has only two shrimps, some veges and green pepper. In traditional Thai dish, they don't have green pepper in curry because there's no pepper in Thai! 
Very disappointed. The only thing good about this place is the decoration. I will never go again."}
{"text":"My family and I just had an unpleasant experience at this restaurant. I read all the good reviews onYelp and went to the restaurant's website for the phone number. I called but could not get through and left a clear message with the number in our party  and the time along with my phone number. Then we headed out, even though no one had returned my call.
When we got there, the fellow at the door did not have my reservation. Rather than be gracious about it, he was adamant that I must have called the wrong place (I didn't) and he kept us waiting while he tried to prove that I had not actually called (I had) . He was not pleasant and argumentative, and finally we left after he said for the 5th time that I had confused restaurants and that there was no room for us. This man was inept and useless.  We were upset, angry and yes, still hungry."}
{"text":"Went there a few times. Food is tasty and service is really good. Staff is friendly and cheerful. Better reserve a few days in advance."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to visit this place - and was SO pleasantly surprised! I personally am not crazy about Thai food and am a bit sensitive to spicy dishes - but this place NAILED IT. amazingly delicious. GREAT service. 

I will definitely be back and I highly recommend! 

dishes we had were: coconut rice, green curry (careful this one is hot!) with chicken and the basil+curry and beef. and the salad rolls - which were my fav! 

The interior is gorgeous by the way - great date spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent Chicken Pad Thai! Quick and friendly take out. We will definitely be back. Thanks"}
{"text":"3rd time to this restaurant. 
Good is delicious. 
Service is professional and friendly. 
Getting your food is quick and hot. 
Awesome place to get in, eat and get out."}
{"text":"Ok-so first...had the corn fritters and dumplings for appies...to friggen die for like so m

any flavors melting in my mouth.!! My hubby had a Thai iced tea-best he's ever had. And yes they use real authentic Thai tea-yummy. We shared the chicken green curry so scrumptious...with coconut rice. Perfect amount for two light eaters to share..we finished off our delightful meal with coconut ice cream and toppings. All I can say is wow...the toppings were so good. All in all this was the best Thai meal I have ever had in all my travels. please go and tempt your taste budsS"}
{"text":"The service was excellent, the decor and ambiance is very nice and the food was generally very tasty. 

-Khao San Angel Wings - interestingly prepared, but imagine spring roll filling stuffed inside a chicken wing.  good, but there are probably better appetizers on the menu
-Khao Soi - A great preparation, not too heavy with coconut milk but still rich and tasty
-Panang Curry - Decent, but I think it was a bit thinner than I was expecting, and missing the kafir lime leaves. 
-Pad Thai - Very authentic tasting, with no ketchup flavours to be found, but a bit on the greasy side (even for Pad Thai)  

All things considered, a great Thai dinner.  Be sure to make reservations on Saturday nights!"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food, artfully presented. 

I'd stop by way more frequently, except they do a poor job with their reservation system. Our first visit, we didn't have a reservation (horror upon horror), for which we were chastised, then told that Maybe we could be seated, IF we could eat and leave within an hour. There were 2 empty tables. We chose to stay, thinking we could go elsewhere for dessert if we didn't have enough time. Luckily, they present their food quickly, and we felt only slightly rushed.

Twice I've been told, upon calling for reservations, that we'd have an hour or 1.5 hr time limit. Why such sticklers? And then the server always brings up, once again, when you're being seated, what your time limit is. Not relaxing. Even when, of course, their quick service is what makes tables turnover more quickly.

And there's frequently at least one empty table, and at least one couple who is turned away for lack of a reservation. Just so you're warned.

I'd say it isn't worth the anxiety, except we haven't found a tastier Thai place in Calgary."}
{"text":"Food was so good. The Poung Chom-Poo is great and looks amazing. The service was really good, food was fast and staff was the right amount of friendliness."}
{"text":"Coconut soup was perfect! The portions are not too large, like in some other places, where you can barely finish one dish by yourself. The size is just right to keep a space for appetizer or curry. Very yummi, yet not that kids friendly. We felt quite weird with preschooler and baby, although service was on a highest level. Probably it's better idea to come there with kids during the day, not after 6 pm."}
{"text":"Khao San is my favorite thai food restaurant.   They do everything right from friendly service to great atmosphere to presentation to outstanding food.  I eat thai food all the time, and this place is on top. Commonly my favorite dish is the red curry.  It is the best in town by a mile.  Watch out though, three star spicy is crazy spicy. Make a reservation because the restaurant is quite popular and has very limited seating. They commonly turn guests away due to not being able to fit people in."}
{"text":"Ate there on July 26, 2017.  The food was mediocre, but the service was great.  I ordered Massaman Curry.  The food was bland and it didn't seem to follow the ingredients listed, like no peanut when the menu and the recipe calls for it.  Also, the meat was fatty and on the bone, and the soup was watered down.  My friends thought their food was mediocre at best as well, although I can't remember what they ordered.  All of us are regular Thai food eaters and have dined at many restaurants. I've also been to Thailand a few years ago and so I know what good Thai food taste like."}
{"text":"Dinner with dear friends this past Saturday.
My first visit to Khao San Thai Kitchen
Beautiful menu.
Wonderful, upscale decor, inside.
Low noise level ...no need to yell at your dinner companions.
So? How about the food?
Beautiful to look at ......
Even better to eat it.
Appetizers ,salads,soups,mains,and deserts, all beautifully prepared, served and quickly DEVOURED.
I will be back to try other items on the menu.
Some of the best Thai food I have had anywhere that I have travelled."}
{"text":"A little over priced but it is on 17th, so it's to be expected. Good food and good location."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant!!  Working nearby we probably frequent it at least once a week. The green curry is the best!  The service is quick and always so friendly. I guess we are recognized as \"regulars\" now as every once and awhile the owner will treat us to complimentary spring rolls or the amazing coconut ice cream. I love that they appreciate our loyalty."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is fantastic. Best place to get thai in the city."}
{"text":"Food are good and server helped change plates 3,4 times. They charge 15% service fee for table over 6. It is good for groups as well as date. Pineapple fried rice and stir fry with chicken were smell and taste good."}
{"text":"A very good place for Thai food.
The quality of the food is very good and the staff is very helpful.
Making reservations is recommended because it's a small place and you may not be able to get a table when it's busy.
I have gone there two times without reservation and couldn't get in.
During the week without reservations should be fine since they're not that busy then.
I'll go back there again."}
{"text":"I had only had Thai food once before and the waiter was VERY helpful with helping me pick my dish. The food was incredibly delicious. From the beer to the dessert; I loved it!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place the moment I walked in.

Wonderful interior, which is a common theme in this review thread. The owner/manager was extremely welcoming and friendly to us throughout the entire meal. 

The Crying Tiger marinated rib eye was cold. Their massaman curry was delicious. Their pad thai held up to my expectations of how pad thai should taste. I devoured their Koong Ob Woon Sen (prawns and glass noodle). They serve Thai ice tea, which not many places I go do. Any time you go to a Thai restaurant, always check to see if they have this. Khao San made a damn good Thai ice tea.

I was here for my birthday. We didn't tell them ahead of time, but the servers must have picked up on it because they gave us a complimentary coconut ice cream with a candle. We were all blown away (pun intended) by the attention to detail and personal touch.

I found my new favourite Thai restaurant. Thanks for the great memory!"}
{"text":"Date night = Thai night! 

What a cute little place this is. We walked in around 7:30 on a Friday without a reservation and were able to be seated, which was awesome - especially since we seemed to just miss the next rush of people that came in after us (at least 5 more tables) 
Service was amazing. Always checking up on us but not being disruptive, fast and efficient and smiling. The décor was very warming and made me feel like I wasn't in Calgary, there is a lot to look at and enjoy.

We ordered the Poung Chom-Poo to start which is steamed dumplings, and what came to our table was an art! These adorable little flower shaped pockets of deliciousness - if you come here, you need to try these (I almost didn't want to eat them, they were that cute.)

For our mains we ordered the Pineapple Fried Rice and chicken ginger stir-fry. Both dishes were amazing, the flavour and the portions seemed to be right on target to us. 

It was a nice night made fantastic by Khao San Thai Kitchen. I am already planning what I am going to get when I go next!"}
{"text":"Visited there for the first time tonight February  24 and very glad we did. Food quality was excellent and service was great. Very tasty Tom Yam soup and Green Curry Chicken. The Pad See Ew was awesome. We will be back for certain."}
{"text":"I've never been one to crave Thai food but after visiting Khao San I'm already trying to plan my next visit! The restaurant is beautifully decorated and very inviting and right when you sit down you feel like you're in for a treat. The menu is quite extensive and so I let my friends who had eaten here before do the ordering. We ordered the Khao San Angel stuffed chicken wings and Poung Chom-Poo dumplings to start. The dumplings were basically a piece of art as they were shaped as pretty little flowers, and right off the bat I could tell that they took pride in the presentation of their food. For our mains we ordered the Braised Short Ribs in Massaman Curry, the Sam Rod Basa, Pad Thai Koong Sod and of course Coconut Rice. EVERYTHING we ate was so flavorful! I swear during the whole meal I kept saying \"oh my god this is so good\". I wish I had pictures of everything we ate but we devoured the food right when it came to our table. I was happy to learn that you can order food to go, which is definitely something I will do in the future. One might look at the prices of the dishes on the menu and think that it is expensive, but the portions they serve are big and the quality and flavor of the food is definitely worth it. The service was excellent as they were very attentive and always made sure we didn't need anything. And because we were there to celebrate a birthday they even brought out a complimentary scoop of coconut ice cream with a candle on it. I seriously cannot wait to go back and visit this place!"}
{"text":"Based on the restaurant alone. Not child friendly at all. No high chairs and the manager came over just after we ordered and said \" it's a war zone over here\". We left immediately."}
{"text":"Yes, the décor is awesome. Yes, the food is good. Yes, the staff is extremely friendly and attentive. But $22 for some stir fry and a cup of soup? That's insane."}
{"text":"Sat outside, great vibe with friendly service.  As a couple our server did wait for the right moment to attend us and our drinks and started came out promptly.   Mains equally divine."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in city. I have been here several times with friends and not once was I disappointed.  The food is good and the service is excellent. Love their masaman braised short ribs. I've bring several friends here and all of them have been ever since raving about this restaurant."}
{"text":"5 reasons why you should go to Khao San Thai Kitchen:

1. The location: right off 17th ave and 13th street.

2. Good service: while the night we went it was very busy, everything came out relatively fast and our waitress was really friendly and attentive. The owners are so nice and we all received free coconut ice cream at the end of our meals because they recognized my two friends who had already been there on their opening week and appreciated them coming back and bringing two other guests. This kind of service is so important and some restaurants (even new ones) just don't get it. They are either indifferent or overbearing (*cough* cibo *cough*)

3. Nice decor/layout: Sure it looks like a typical Thai place but the paintings are interesting! It definitely looks more cozy, upscale and clean than other Thai places I have been too.

4. The drinks: They are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. I wish they showed their drinks online because I can't remember what I ordered but it was delicious and my boyfriend got a kind of Thai milk drink that went very well with his spicy food.

5. THE FOOD: It was simply delicious! I find other Thai dishes to be oily and greasy (especially Pad Thai) but this was perfect, not too peanutty or saucy or dry. Everyone else ordered curries that were very spicy and smelled delicious. You can also ask for how spicy you want it and they actually stay true to what you ask for.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in Calgary, with great service and really peaceful and lovely  atmosphere inside. Definitely worth the visit. We will be returning."}
{"text":"The food tasted really good but I and a friend got sick once after eating it. It might have been a coincidence, who knows, but we did not go back there!"}
{"text":"Best best best Thai restaurant I've ever been to! Every single thing was super delicious :) The servers were very friendly and helpful, and the food came really fast. I would give 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"I have not YET been to Thailand to judge for myself the rumours of authenticity regarding this restaurant but wow, if this is what it tastes like, I am SOLD!
I had been looking for Calgary's best Pad Thai since we moved out here 3 years ago and tonight, I found it here. I just wanted to start singing and dancing about it upon eating my first bite! The noodles taste of quality and are cooked perfectly with the right thickness. The seasoning and sauce are of the perfect quantity and consistency. Subtle egg and beautiful tail-off shrimp are included, also perfectly cooked. Nothing was overly done and the peanuts and lime on the side hit the mark.
Hubby had the Panang curry and he too had to agree it was the best he has had so far in town. And I say that knowing that we have been to most Thai spots within Calgary. We ordered coconut rice to go with the curry. It complimented it beautifully and tasted like it was made fresh with good bite to it still.
We arrived at 530pm on a Tues night. It was freezing out but that did not keep people away. An hour later, every seat in the house was taken and it appeared that everyone else too was loving their food. The service was super friendly without being overbearing.
There was a delicious bottled Thai beer that was interesting to try and a selection of red and white wine. As soon as you sit down, you will be poured a nice glass of water without even asking. And, it is free water, what a concept!
They were out of 2 of the 4 desserts (coconut ones) but that did not impact us whatsoever as we were too stuffed to get anything else. Maybe next time. There is also a mango one that sounded great.
Thankfully we did not order appies (too full) but I think next time we will judging from all the spring rolls coming out of the kitchen. This place solves the double dip dilemma as each spring roll is inside a long shot glass with dip at the bottom. Genius!
The decor here is elegant, clean, simple and the mood was right on.
The prices are on par with downtown Calgary and we found the portion sizes of the entrees to be more than enough.
TIP - if you park at the back of the restaurant, it is free after 6pm on the street. The owner/manager was nice enough to walk us out the back of the restaurant to where our car was so we did not have to walk all the way around outside in the cold.
We will return as often as I can to try everything else they make!"}
{"text":"All Thai restaurants should be judged on their Pad Thai.  It's amazing how this simple dish can be so different from place to place, much like a bowl of pho.  But that's the irony of it all...the simplest things are often the most difficult to duplicate.  Nevertheless, there IS a standard and Khao San's pad thai is very close to perfection.

Pad Thai- 4 stars.  The sauce is spot on with a nice light peanutty tamarind sauce that doesn't overwhelm the rest of the ingredients, allowing you to taste the protein, bean sprouts, spices, lime and even noodles!  What's most surprising is the size of the portion...most Thai restaurants of this caliber never serve that much pad thai on a dish (let alone, the rest of the menu), but I'm not complaining, just amazed that they were able to maintain the flavors.  The only thing keeping this dish from being a perfect 5 stars is the grease...just a tad too much cooking oil.  It's not enough to settle on the plate, but you can certainly see it clinging onto the noodles.  

Sweet rice w/ Thai custard- 4 stars.  This is one of the lightest versions I've had, though very good.  The sweet sticy rice has just the perfect amount of palm sugar (I assume) and coconut milk to stimulate your senses.  The rice, itself, is held together lightly...normally, they're much denser after being handled.  The custard is as good as it gets, without being too sweet.  My only gripes are the sesame seeds and portions of custard and coconut sauce.  I've never had this dish with sprinkled sesame seeds, so it was a little weird and the crunchiness took away from the soft, tender experience of consuming this dish.  I also would've liked the custard to be cut the size of the rice (and perhaps served a bit warmer, as it was a bit cold to the taste).  As small as the rice was (cube shaped), the custard was even smaller....it's not a garnish but rather a co-main ingredient in this dish.  And finally, the coconut sauce was nearly absent with only a drop or two on top of the minuscule custard.  A drizzle or brush of the sauce would've been just as pleasing on the eyes as it would've been to the mouth.

Looking forward to trying the other dishes!"}
{"text":"My go-to Thai place in Calgary, ordering from this place bi-weekly. The food is incredible and reasonably priced (I tend to go for the red curry- the pumpkin is to die for- and salad rolls I get most often) The longest I've waited for pick-up is 20 minutes on a larger order- typically they take 10-15 to put everything together.

Staff is super friendly every time I pick up. Definitely go to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I want to give it five stars... but I'm holding out, because I've never been to Thailand for Pad Thai, and I want to taste the real deal first. But, I will say this place has never let me down whenever I was craving some flavourful Pad Thai. As far as Calgary goes, this is one of the better Thai places in my books. It's elegant, and clean inside; the decor is pleasing, and the atmosphere is relaxed. Since I'm often in the neighbourhood, it's a kinda nice to drop off on 17th Ave SW when I'm looking for a quick bite. I've come here numerous times, and it's been a consistently pleasing experience overall. I will certainly be back when the mood strikes me!"}
{"text":"We always order the green curry and chicken pad Thai from here and we are always impressed. Our favourite Thai in Calgary!"}
{"text":"This was hands down a winner!  We left in search of Chinese and along the route we saw a Thai restaurant (not the one we chose) but that took me on a yelp search for Thai....
We were both amazed at the freshness and flavors which were nothing shy of cataclysmic!! 
Really.
I would highly recommend this place and in fact will be bringing my daughters when we come to Calgary again for a visit!!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best Thai restaurant we have been to in Calgary. The staff are friendly, the atmosphere is great and the food is amazing! We had the vegetarian spring rolls and khao san salsa scallops for starters, and the pad thai koung sod and braised short ribs in massaman curry for main courses. The presentation and flavours were well beyond our expectations, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First when we got there we didnt make a reservation even though it was on the week day but still it was completely full . So we decided to go another Thai restaurant. After that a week we came back ,luckily it wasn't full so we ordered some coconut soup , moo-ping (grilled pork in stick) , stir fried beef with Thai basil and served with streamed rice. Moo- ping was sooo good and there is no any Thai restaurants in Calgary have this menu and Thai milk tea was perfect . Love it so much."}
{"text":"Great place for a dinner date or lunch.  Decor is very nice and they just opened the patio.  Food is very well done with great flavor.  We had two appetizers, pad Thai, green curry chicken and coconut rice, came to $53 without tip.  Overall great experience.  The only thing I would say that keeps them from getting 5 stars is the small quantity of protein in the dishes."}
{"text":"Delightful service and outstanding food. Loved the creative presentation of the spring rolls!"}
{"text":"Overall, the food was great. The service was also remarkable. However, I do find the food more westernized than other Thai food I've had before. They are seriously NOT cheap for the portion they served. I still enjoy the White Elephant more."}
{"text":"Incredible appetizers, I recommend the spring rolls and corn bread. The main course was quite good, but not notably better than other quality Thai restaurants. The service was excellent and extremely attentive. The restaurant is very clean and easily the most ornate and well decorated Thai restautant I've attended. It is well priced, I recommend it."}
{"text":"One of my go-to places for Thai. On the Beltline and has a patio for these warm summer nights. Tons of vegan options too (just ask)! And I love their peanut sauce on everything."}
{"text":"Good Thai food for Calgary.  The Tom Kha was the most flavorful such soup I have every had.  The pad thai was a greasy, and had a burnt flavor.  Service was superb."}
{"text":"We had the signature braised beef curry and pad Thai. Amazing service and staff were so kind and attentive! Delicious food, very clean and great atmosphere! The Thai iced tea was a little sweet and wasn't separated between tea and milk so it didn't seem house brewed. We would have preferred the traditional mango and coconut dessert but the egg custard was a good change too. Lovely atmosphere and absolute best staff!"}
{"text":"Great service. Incredible ambience.  The food is scrumptious and delicious - we eat here every time we come to Calgary"}
{"text":"Good customer service... priced right .. roughly $25-30 a person with tip... ordered 5 dishes with 2 bowls of rice and 2 desserts ... I would definitely go again...

Make sure you have a Rez... we had to wait a bit for our table, but the host served us appetizers  complementary for waiting... that's good customer service...

Food was very tasty ... with new and fresh spices...we had a party of 4 and a great time..."}
{"text":"This could be worth a 5 star for Thai for overall ambience, decor, service and food. 

Noticed how I left value out of it LOL nor would I expect it.  This is Thai fine dining--nice table linen too.

ordered that popular appy that look like pretty pink flowers, dumpling with sweet sauce and peanutty.  highly recommended.

ordered the green curry chicken, nicely chopped different colours of green and orange peppers.   $16 for this area is the going rate.

definitely date worthy or a nice evening out.

great customer service, asked how my meal was.

AMEX yay

very nice washrooms with a communal sink."}
{"text":"Food was amazing but service was awful!! People who came in 30mins after me had their food before me and waiter never came to my table to ask how things were...then to top it all off they wiped down the table with me still sitting at it after my meal!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, but service was terrible. They forgot about us for a bit so we had to call someone over, our beers was forgotten, and after explaining what vegans can't eat, my dish came out with eggs. So come for the food if you don't mind waiting, and being a little annoyed"}
{"text":"This is a pretty darn good little Thai place! The service was excellent and the food was great! I wish there was more room on the patio - there was barely room for three tables and there definitely wasn't enough chairs. Despite our squishy encounters we enjoyed the lovely presentation of our spring rolls! The pad thai was really good but a little on the bland side and the third dish (beef) was also quite delicious.  All in all I really like this place and I'll definitely come back the next time I'm craving Thai. It's really adorable on the inside and the servers are very attentive."}
{"text":"Favourite thai place in the city! A little pricey but the food more than makes up for it. The pad thai is one of the best I've ever had. No idea how they get the noodles to that perfect chewy density but damn do they nail it. Panang curry is also fantastic. Sweet, aromatic, perfect level of spice. Make sure to upgrade to Coconut rice!"}
{"text":"Consistently Calgary's Best Thai

I have been to Khao San 20+ times, and have never been disappointed.  High quality, beautiful presenations, and great flavours all combine for a consistently memorable meal.  

Service is top notch, among the best in the city of any restaurant type.  

Favourite dishes - any of the curries, Pad See Ew (for a nice change from Pad Thai), Basil Stir Fry, and all the appetizers.  Heck, it's all good - just try anything they serve."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place (which replaces the loved, lamented Jaro Blue) when the incredibly nice owners let me know they'd worked at Thai Sa On and Thai Boat, both of which have excellent reps in Calgary. My first visit was for lunch and was not disappointed. $13 got me a big serving of red curry (got mine with pork), studded with pumpkin, and a nice big pile of jasmine rice. DELICIOUS. Subsequent visits (I've been there 4 times now) I've become addicted to their spin on basil stir-fry which, I think, is best with beef. They do NOT hold back on the spicing if you request \"authentic Thai\" and what I had the other day just about blew my lips off- so, so good! And not just because it was spicy. Flavours are excellent, rice is perfect, and the service is incredibly solicitous."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Thai place in Calgary. The chef/owner used to be the head chef at the Calgary Golf and Country Club I think.. He uses the best ingredients. The staff is friendly and the interior is beautifully decorated. I'm not a big dessert fan, but the desserts are a must try!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and for some reason hadn't visited Koh San yet - I was hooked from the first visit! The pad thai is delicious, the Crying Tiger is tender and juicy with the right amount of heat, the curries have wonderful flavours, and the coconut ice cream is the perfect light dessert. 

The owner is super friendly and always smiling, which is so nice. Overall this place is a great Thai restaurant with very flavourful food and great ambience!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in town hands down! All the ingredients were fresh, and cooked to perfection. The desserts we had were not only delicious but totally different than anything we'd really ate before.
This place is a must!"}
{"text":"Delicious! We had an early reservation and were seated and served so quick that it felt casual. I'm not complaining though - we were there for the food. Buttery and creamy rice noodles, mango shrimp, spicy beef for my partner. Each dish was impressive and these guys know what they are doing!"}
{"text":"I have come here 4-5 times over the past year and I feel like their food was gotten progressively worse. All the curries taste the same - red, green, yellow, blue - it doesn't matter it all has the same combination of mild spice + watery coconut milk + salt. The curry is also very sparse in terms of vegetables& protein. The coconut rice doesn't really have much of a coconut flavour. The appetizers I've tried (spring rolls, salad, soups) don't blow my mind either. The spring rolls taste just like frozen ones but they come in a fancy glass with the sauce. They are pretty representative of the quality of food you'll find at Khao San: pretty, upscale presentation of mediocre food. I mean I think it says something about a Thai restaurant that they receive a glowing review for pineapple fried rice and ginger chicken stir fry, while comments about their curries and other Thai dishes are pretty lacklustre. To top it all off this place is quite expensive - especially for Thai food. I would definitely recommend going to Taste of Thailand instead; it's only a few blocks away and is more authentic and better value."}
{"text":"1. Location: 3.5/5 Located on the busy street. On Sunday, street park is free.
2. Atmosphere and Service: 4.5/5 Mixture of tradition amd modern interior. Very clean. Very friendly and customer oriented service. Ask them if you are not sure what to order. They will explain the menu in detail.
3. Quantity & Quality: 5/5 We had only two dishes: Pad Sew and Shrimp Noodle. Even my wife agrees woth me that they are even better than 4 Thai bistro in Cali. And a plate has so much food.
4. Price: 5/5 In considering their service and quality of foods, it is a best of all Thai places.

I strongly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was below average. I had to return the Tom Kha soup back to the kitchen as it was lukewarm for reheatinng. I understand that they make a stock of it, but atleast it can be heated up before serving. Penang curry was alright . The basil chicken was however retuned to kitchen . The meat was dry and tasteless and the sauce was minimal with little taste . The cosmopolitan tasted good though- it was the highlight of the meal. 

Maybe they were just having a bad day. I'm definitely not going back though."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, so perhaps maybe take out is not as good as dining in. 

I was happy that they had vegetarian options on their menu to start with instead of having to guess what they would be able to do.

I ordered two Tom Kha soups. The flavor of the broth was great, but it ONLY came with white button mushrooms (not Asian) and fried tofu. This was greatly disappointing. This is the only time I've received this soup at a restaurant with no other vegetables, so it wasn't that great to eat. Imagine a thin soup with giant barely cooked white mushrooms and large chunks of fried tofu. It's very weird. 

I also ordered a Pad Thai as someone else on yelp said it wasn't very oil unlike other places and was good. It was in fact very oily and a complete conglomerate. Could barely serve it as the noodles were glued together and obviously not cooked fresh. No bean sprouts either! Sad face...The noodles had became all broken and this was disappointing as well. 

Royal Garden Delight was the last dish ordered and was stir fried vegetables with thin glass noodles.  The flavor was good, but again it was extremely oily. 

I would not order any of those items again, but I would consider dining in and trying their other items for a better overview of their cuisine. Thai food is one of my favorites so it's sad to not be wowed when getting some of your favorites."}
{"text":"Why 5 stars?... Because they really deserve it!!... Everything was delicious!!.. Since the beginning to the end!!.. Nothing to complain!!.. They have a Thai beer which is really good, even when I am not a beer lover, I think this was not bad. My father who knows about beers, loved it!... I had a cocktail and it was great!! To start I had the Tom Kha soup and it was exquisite!!... The spring rolls were great too!.. As a main course we had the pad Thai and the red curry beef to share. I can't say which one was better. Both were AWESOME!!..  The dessert was Incredible just like everything we tried!!.. 

To complete the 5 stars the service was excellent!!.. The waiters are very friendly and the prices very reasonable. Also, the place is very beautiful. I think there is not one thing I didn't like!!.

I can't wait to go back there!!"}
{"text":"We love our Thai food and know it well from our visits to Thailand. This is our favourite in calgary!  Have tried their curries, pad Thai, all appies, mango and sticky rice, and it's all great. Highly recommend if you are looking for a new Thai spot."}
{"text":"I don't usually love Thai food. But this place is phenomenal, it has really good food, I especially love there appetizers. Like their dumplings and spring rolls, etc. They have  dumplings that look like flowers which are really unique. This place is probably the best Thai in Calgary. It's so good can't get over it."}
{"text":"After reading some good reviews on yelp, a few friends and I decided to give Khao San Thai Kitchen a try, and boy were we not disappointed. I never went to the space when it was Jaro Blue, however, the current, new restaurant is sleek, upscale and cozy looking without looking too dark or stuffy. We ordered a round of drinks from the smiling server (Singapore sling, Mojito, Caesar, and a glass of white wine, all pretty good), and  were then overwhelmed by the options on the menu. So many curries, noodle dishes, appetizers, salads and veggie dishes to choose from, all sounding and, with wafts from the kitchen, smelling delicious. 
We settled on the papaya salad and the scallops to start, followed by a green currie with chicken, the pad thai, the drunken \"fried spaghetti\", and two bowls of coconut rice. The scallops came in soup spoons and were cooked to buttery perfection and the papaya salad was a refreshing way to start the meal. By the time the entrees came out, we were looking forward to eating it all. 
The curry was flavourful, with just the right amount of spice (though I may ask for a bit spicer next time, clearly I wasn't sweating enough...), and the pad thai had big shrimp and a nice flavour, complimented with crushed peanuts on the plate. I think the \"fried spaghetti\" was my favourite dish, an interesting cross between western spaghetti and seafood pad thai, with thickish noodles, a nice sauce, and a mix of vegetables and seafood (shrimp, mussels, squid). 
If Khao San Thai Kitchen was but a little closer to my work lunch walking radius, I would definitely be there for lunch once a week. I'll definitely be back for dinner to try more of their menu and perhaps squeeze in a dessert or two. 
Three cheers for quality Thai food on 17th avenue!"}
{"text":"We happened upon Khao San one Saturday evening without reservations and were graciously seated by the host. 

Our meal of Fried Tofu, Green Curry and Charred Noodles with Stir Fried Vegetables was excellent. The service was prompt and friendly. Even though the restaurant was nearly full, it wasn't super noisy like it would have been back home in the US. The prices were quite fair. 

My husband and I had a wonderful dinner at Khao San. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Khao San Thai is fantastic!!! 

After seeing many pictures of the dumplings, I had to try them. They were equally as beautiful as the pictures showed, but they were also really, really good! 

I also ordered the Thom Kha soup with chicken. It was perfectly spicy, perfectly creamy, and a perfect portion. 

I was a tad bit disappointed with the Panang Curry. I dont know what I expected, but that wasnt it. It was still good, but needed something else. 

I would definitely return to Khao San when I return to Calgary."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time a while ago with a large group of people and while I'm not too familiar with Thai food, I am definitely a fan of spice, curries and coconut-based dishes and after a lot of positive reviews, I was excited to give this place a go. The place is pretty small and while we thought we were seated pretty far away from the door, it got pretty drafty. The server was quick, attentive and pretty organized considering our large group. 

A friend and I split the spring rolls and the Thai style beef jerky. The spring rolls came out individually in their own shot glasses with the chili sauce at the bottom. Really cute presentation, great for sharing and delicious! The beef jerky kind of fell short and lacked really any flavour.. I don't really know what I was expecting though to be honest. 

For mains, we split an order of pra ram song lam, which was this chicken and spinach dish in this AMAZING creamy peanut sauce, as well the pa-nang curry with added shrimp. For all the curries and stir-fried dishes, you can customize the type of protein you would like (chicken, pork, beef or prawn). We got a side of coconut rice to share as well, which turned out to be plenty between the two of us. The pa-nang was heavenly and the prawns were HUGE, you got 6 pieces total so perfect for sharing. My girlfriend loved the pra ram song lam. It wasnt as saucy as the curry (obviously), but still very good. 

For dessert we shared the mango sweet sticky rice, which again was great for sharing, as it came out in 6 pieces. Unfortunately it wasn't as sweet as traditional sweet sticky rice so there wasn't much flavour. 

Overall, I probably need to come back just for the pa-nang curry as I just couldn't get enough of it. The coconut rice on the side was also a must. The bill came to be approx. $30ish/person and considering the amount of food we got (without drinks) I felt like it was a pretty good price."}
{"text":"I love Thai, and this place is one of the best I've been to. I was greeted quickly (as were all the guests that night), and led to a clean table with hefty cutlery and cloth napkins. I ordered the Tom Yum Soup, which came piping hot and delicious. Then, I had the Chicken Cashew Stir Fry. Absolutely wonderful with a side of rice. Excellent ambiance, gracious service, lovely food. A winner for sure!"}
{"text":"Great service. Our starters came out 10 min after we ordered. Waitress was very attentive, always making sure our water glasses were full. All our dishes were delicious. Just the right amount of spiciness. Will go back."}
