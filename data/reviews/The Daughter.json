{"text":"I ate here with my boyfriend on a Saturday night few weeks ago. It was empty at the time and we chose to sit outside. The decor is cool and the patio was nice. I have eaten at the farmhouse a few times and was excited to try the new place.
In brief - 
Food: I had veggie dishes (tomato and cheese salad and ravioli) and my boyfriend (being a seafood fan from gaspee) had oysters and the octopus. My food was great (really no complaints) however my boyfriend was a little disappointed with his dishes. He said they were both good, just not great.  Desert was lacklustre  - had the chocolate ice cream sandwich. Was really just ok - it tasted really bland somehow. 



Service:
This is where the place lost points. I don't consider myself a picky patron, but when it's Saturday night and there is only one other couple eating at the resto, you kind of expect the basics to go smoothly. We ordered our mains and apps at the same time. 15 minutes later our waitress came by to ask of we had decided on food. We said we had already orderd and after a few awkward minutes she came back and said that she had not forgotten after all and had placed our orders. Not the end of the world, by any means, I mean people forget things, but kind of surprising. It was obvious that she had forgotten when the other couple that arrived after us were served before us, even when they ordered the same dishes (oysters). When our food arrived we didn't get the same schpeal she had given the other couple about the sauces with the oysters etc. just plunked them down in front of us. Maybe she thought we heard them the first time? Last, it took forever for us to get our bill because she was speaking to possibly the chef (someone from the kitchen) for 45mins with her back to us. The person seemed upset so she seemed really engaged and couldn't see our pleading looks. I get it, we were the only ones left in the resto but a glance back would have been nice. We are from Montreal and not shy about signalling for the cheque!

All and all I felt like the staff were very nice but seemed a bit juvenile somehow (I'm 28 so it's not like I'm expecting some high brow affair). The food was good and I would likely only go back on Sunday nights when things are bargain prices"}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I went to the farmers daughter. This was our third time dining here and each and every time the staff have been incredibly welcoming and passionate about the food.
The food is inventive and delicious. The atmosphere is simple and intimate. The chef is approachable and happy to talk about the food - if you can sit at the chefs table at the back, I highly recommend it! 
We will be back, and soon."}
{"text":"Why haven't you been here yet? The food, drinks and service will make you so happy!
My husband and I went for dinner on a Wednesday evening. We were greeted by a friendly server who quickly took our drink order and delivered a couple of cocktails to start our evening off right. 
To start we shared oysters, fried shrimp, the staff snack (bone barrow and toast), and scallops and beets. All were delicious but the shrimp and bone marrow toast made our taste buds the happiest. Then we had a bottle of the Farmhouse Baco Noir with pig poutine (containing crispy pig ears and belly) and pastapus (squid ink pasta with grilled octopus sausage). I would definitely order both again.
The food has a lot going on but it works and the tastes come together beautifully in your mouth. Chef Leonie even came out to deliver some of our dishes and discuss the food further with us, which was a treat. 
It was a fabulous evening at Farmer's Daughter and when we left we were full, happy, and perfectly tipsy for the walk home."}
{"text":"The absolute worst.

Terrible service from an extremely inattentive and rude young female.
Terribly overpriced and underwhelming food. Not to mention $3.50 for a drip coffee, no refills.

The Daughter justifies Yelp's service: to help others save time and money in this crazy, mixed-up world."}
{"text":"I have been to the Farmhouse Tavern and loved it, so I was excited to try their sister restaurant. Unfortunately, it was a let down. For starters, they forgot to write down our reservation, so we had to wait for our table. And although the food was fine, the menu choices were very limited. The service was also quite poor (aside from the bartender, who was  attentive). Our meal finished with no dessert options, which was disappointing for this pregnant lady. The restaurant itself is cute and cozy, so I might try it for brunch, but wouldn't go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Bad, bad, bad and dirty! Sat at the bar because the tables were reserved which is fine except that the girl behind the bar who looked to be about 16 and had hair down to her hips not tied ignored us for 10 minutes. 
We finally got coffee and ordered, the cream container had dried cream on it which went in coffee. Watched the girl with the long hair touch her face and hair and then make Caesars and using her hands (unwashed) pick out shrimps with black tails (which means they are not fresh) then fingers in the horseradish and into the drink... When she finished she wiped her hands on her pants. To open champagne she held it between her legs like really? 
The older ladies shirt was unbuttoned so I could constantly see her belly button so unprofessional.
The food came and the trout and scrambled eggs came on a half a bagel with a little bit of salad, salty and not nearly worth $14, the least they could do is give you the other half of the bagel! Eggs Benedict had only 2 little pieces of bacon and the bottom half of the biscuit was burnt and so hard I had to stab it to cut it. No coffee refill either! Will never waste my money there again, had to go to Tim Hortons to get a coffee."}
{"text":"I had a disappointing experience, but the food was good enough for me to try again.

FOOD:
I had the eggs benedict and was thoroughly satisfied.  The fresh biscuit the eggs were placed on were the perfect texture and the hollandaise had a great twist of cinnamon that made the whole dish come together.  The menu is small, so check before hand if you want to make sure they have something you like. 

ATMOSPHERE
The restaurant is small, but takes reservations via Open Table which is a god-send for me.  The restaurant had a smell to it.  It could have been the frog legs, I have never smelt them, but the smell was like mildew or a wet towel.  It came in waves and permeated the room.

SERVICE:
Unfortunately, the service was slow and not much attention was paid to us.  Though when we caught there attention they were responsive.  I saw people that ordered after me get their meal before me, which never feels good.

OVERALL:
As mentioned above, these few bumps I experienced that day were over-shadowed by the food, as I am craving those eggs benedict again and will probably make a reservation soon."}
{"text":"Dear Darcy MacDonell,

Your location is interesting, the vibe of the resto is relaxed and artsy, and your staff are for the most part, quite friendly. My friend and I shared a burger that was fine, though I was disappointed that the fries were made with floury textured russet potatoes  (my least fav). Also, since there was no menu and the mains didn't seem to be written up on your chaulk board, I have no idea what we paid for that burger. I hope no more than $12. But I'm writing about the Ploughman's platter that you sell as an appetizer for a whopping $23. I was so disappointed and to be honest, a little offended by what was served. There were 2 razor-thin slivers of saucage, 2 match-book-size tastes of interesting cheese, 5 toonie-sized pieces of somewhat passed-it gravlax, two half pieces of toast, two inedible soft-boiled picked eggs (an overwhelming taste of white vinegar), and one other solf-boiled egg deep-fried in a tempura-type batter. Oh, and a selection of picked veggies used to dress the plate. I am a veggie lover with a particular fondness for  picked anything but we found your veggies, along with your eggs so unappetizing that they were left dressing the plate when it was picked up.  $23 is a lot to pay for the amount of food that I might put in my child's school lunch. For that price, you need to offer more than a couple of ounces of fish, meat or cheese. Then there was the kale caesar. I was excited about this - I've had kale caesars before that blew my socks off. (Have you tried the one at FoodLiner?!) But the one at your resto had the taste and texture of, well, egg yolk. Very salty, sticky egg yolk. We left at least half on the plate too.
I like to be encouraging, not critical. But we did pay $100 with tip for a meal that in the end amounted to a pint and a half of beer and a half burger each. So I thought I would write you to let you know the thoughts of this particular customer. I hope you fix these problems and I hope the restaurant thrives. Best of luck."}
{"text":"This place is so cool!! Great food, staff, decor and an amazing patio. 
Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Farmhouse Tavern down the street.
When I heard that they were opening up a new spin-off restaurant, I was excited to check it out!

Farmer's Daughter Eatery is like the smaller, hipper, seafood loving, and boozing little sister of the original restaurant.  The space is bright and much more modern than expected.  There was a large patio space but since the place is newer, it didn't seem very ambient and we chose to be seated inside.

The menu was very small but there were some interesting items.
I went with the southern fried froglegs on waffles.

The waffles were soaked in syrup and the maple butter was freaking amazing.
The frog legs were tasty, interesting...tender..sort of crispy...
The legs are also full of little bones... so more effort to eat.  More than I would like in the morning.

The burger was stacked high and the presentation was pretty with purple cabbage slaw.  It was made fresh, but it needed some time to rest because it was ooozing and dripping juice all over the place.  The pretzel bun added a lot of saltiness and was soft and yummy.

Be warned, if you are ordering a mimosa, the mimosa was tiny. 
Like a kid sized mimosa for small little hands.

Overall, brunch was creative, but not outstanding.  Since the restaurant is new, I feel like they will work out the kinks.

They have Sunday evening happy hour specials - \"F@ck Monday!!!!'
I will have to come back for drinks and some seafood! :)"}
{"text":"I wish the customer service was as good as the food and drink. Serving staff acted annoyed with us even though there was only one other table on a Saturday night. They were confused by simple requests and questions. They talked shit about us behind the bar even though we weren't even 5 feet away and heard everything. Since there wasn't anyone waiting for our table and it was far from closing time, we took our time with coffee and dessert. I guess this was the wrong thing to do because when we finished they ignored us for about 20 minutes as if to punish us.  I think the kitchen staff deserves a raise and the owner should hire new service staff ASAP!"}
{"text":"It seems like everyone has ran through the Farmers Daughter except me.  So I decided to give it a try...wait that sounds wrong.  Well, I wanted to try out the Farmers Daughter...that doesn't sound right either.  Ok I wanted to try the food here so I said \"hey whatsup hello\" to this extension of the Farmhouse Tavern.  

I dropped by for lunch and the menu was very select to say the least.  I've heard many people talk about the fish and chips, but there wasn't actually any on the lunch menu?  I see the big fried shrimp sign out front, and there wasn't any fried shrimp on the menu either?  Not sure if the sign was a novelty thing, but I was a little bummed out I couldn't have a pint of beer and skrimps for lunch :(

I asked for the fish and chips regardless and the waitress had the chef bring out a fresh batch.  Also tried the local blonde beer they had to offer and they both paired nicely.  The patio has a backyard at your buddy's house type of feeling, and although they could probably use a few more umbrellas for the sun, it was nice.  I would go round two with the Farmers Daughter, because I had a good time to say the least :)"}
{"text":"We'd been to farmhouse tavern before and enjoyed it very much. We decided to check out its spinoff seafood restaurant for brunch. 

The frog waffle was AMAZING... fried frogs legs with waffles and a red wine and maple butter, the butter was so smooth and just a tad sweet. The fried legs gave a nice salty balance to the sweet waffles. 

We also had the Croque Madame, very nice with a runny egg on top toad in hole style, and served with delicious little sweet potato and Brussels sprouts. 

Our server was great as well, very knowledgeable and friendly... Also helped settle a debate about a PINK mug my coffee came in. 

Overall it was great, a little pricey for brunch but definitely worth it for a once in a while brunch spot."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and few but interesting selection of local breweries. 

Unfortunately didn't try the food since I was coming from an abundant brunch right across the street. 

Will come back to try the food."}
{"text":"Amazing food and excellent service! Highly recommend this place. We just moved to the area and are happy to have this sweet little spot just around the corner. They make awesome egg dishes and the staff are super friendly. Also very kid friendly :)"}
{"text":"Decided to try Farmers Daughter for the first time on Wednesday evening this week. Much like some of the other reviewers, I'm a big fan of Farmhouse Tavern and had been interested in trying out Farmers Daughter for quite some time. Upon entering, we were warmly greeted by our server and if I may add, provided exemplary service throughout the evening. My boyfriend and I each ordered a cocktail, Corpse Reviver and Autumn Sweater. The Autumn Sweater definitely took the cake, rum based, and flavors of apple pie came to mind. The food that followed was an apple salad, pan roast, fried shrimp, eggplant curry, and surf n turf burger all to share (we were hungry!). The food was all really well done, and each dish offered some kind of uniqueness. Nothing was standard and I found that to be exciting, waiting to see how our next dish would come out! The only factor that I found Farmers Daughter to be lacking was oddly enough the decor. There was definitely a disconnect between the delicious food /cocktails and cold/sterile room. However, overall Farmers Daughter was a great experience and we look forward to trying out the brunch menu."}
{"text":"What awful place turn off by customer service.. Cannot give a customer a table coz where 2 people. The table is for 6. One vacant table in the back.. Asked to wait on the bar.. It's not busy rainy afternoon."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner!

Had the bone marrow and cheese dishes to start and the meat as the entree. Ice cream sandwich for dinner. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The rating of 4 stars above reflects what I feel they SHOULD be, not the 3.5 star experience I had.

Our party of 4 was their for their very first brunch service ever, in fact, we were the second table to be seated... EVER!

Our table was evenly split between orders of the frog legs and waffles, and the green eggs and ham (duck egg ouef mollet).

Both dishes were very creative, presented nicely, and most importantly, tasted great! The frog legs were perfectly seasoned and, in my opinion, tasted better than most chicken and waffles. 

The only criticism our group had was that all four of our dishes weren't very hot. Our waffles were barely warm, and the green eggs were literally cold. I'm not sure if the eggs were supposed to be cold or not, but the waffles I know definitely shouldn't have been.

However, since this was only the 2nd table the kitchen had ever served, I'm going to assume this was just due to them ironing out the kinks and give them the full 4 stars I think they likely would've gotten with a bit more experience.

Service was great and from the glowing reviews I've seen it looks to me they have definitely got their kitchen running at 100% now."}
{"text":"Farmer's Daughter is a great addition to the neighbourhood. It is different from its parent (Farmhouse) down the street and stands on its own quite well. The space is bright, yet small, so make a reservation if you have your heart set on eating here.

The menu seems quite simple on the surface. There are about 5 mains and five sides on a board. They have shrimp, burgers, octopus, and a changing variety of other options. Each dish is complex with a variety of flavours and ingredients.

The burger is a surf n turf. I liked the effort, but wasn't crazy about it.. Fish on a burger? It was still tasty, but not my thing.

The fried shrimp are fantastic. Dessert is also highly original and delicious.

Cocktails are unique. Try the Bruce Banner.

I am very enthusiastic about going back here. The service was excellent, and the food (and drinks) allows Farmer's Daughter to stand out and on it's own."}
{"text":"I would give it 3.5 stars if I can change the system.

Thanks to my friend Mikey, happily went there for a Sunday late dinner for the discount special. Had the octopus and veg plate. Octopus was good, but I prefer the one at Bar isabel. Veg N Veg plate was good. Happy to have had a late meal outside on the picnic tables. The patio  umbrella sheltered us from light sprinkle. 

I'll have to try other things on the menu next time.

Service casual, friendly, and polite."}
{"text":"Ugh...really wanted to like this place, but the food is overpriced for the substandard quality.

We met my niece and her fiancée for dinner as they live in the area...and we opted to dine out on the patio, which consisted of wooden picnic tables on a street level patio.

When we arrived, we were seated and our waiter was over shortly thereafter.  I asked if they had lemonade or iced tea. Was told no. Asked if they had diet coke..was told yes. Waiter came back and said they only had coke and sprite. One of my dining companions asked what type of juice they had...and the waiter responded \"orange/mango, or strawberry lemonade\". Um...didn't I ask if they had lemonade? Anyways, it was $4 for something which I drank in about 4 gulps.

We were then told that wine was half price...so one of us ordered a white Pinot. A small glass of white Pinot...half off...came to $8/glass. So normally it would be $16? If that's the case, it's highway robbery.

On to the food.
Person one ordered the \"new\" burger...as its new to the menu. The person who had this said it was ok...but not worth the price. He said the fries were excellent.

Person 2 ordered the fish and chips...it came with coleslaw (according to the menu, their famous coleslaw). The fish was not identified on the menu but he believes it was haddock, a much cheaper cut of fish. The person who had this said it was over battered. 

2 of us had the pasta of the day.....lemon/bacon/onion in a cream sauce. It came with kernels of corn, which I opted not to have and my niece asked for on the side.  I don't think I've ever been so disappointed with a pasta dish in my life. The bacon, while having a nice smokey flavour, was mostly fat, so it was inedible. I could barely taste any hint of lemon....and the portion size was far too small for a $16 price point. The pasta. Fresh though.

Dinner for 4, with the above food items, with 3 glasses of wine (half off), 1 juice, 1 sprite, 6 beers, tax, tip, came to over $160. Completely not worth it. 

All 4 of us, while walking back to our car, agreed we would not be returning."}
{"text":"Went to Farmhouse Tavern not realizing we needed a reso - the owner called up to the Daughter and had a table ready for us!
The food was great - i had the Kale Benny which I loved - the French toast looked amazing and my Dad thoroughly enjoyed the burger... Will def be coming back! And will be making a reso at Farmhouse Tavern"}
{"text":"My family and I were recently here for brunch.

The service left a lot to be desired. We weren't given water, we had to ask for information on their vague (tiny) menu, the restaurant was quiet, yet service was remarkably slow. We were billed for four drinks when we ordered two. If it happens for one, it's a mistake. If it happens for two, well... One of the servers also tried to take our baby for a walk onto the patio. No, you don't do that. 

The food wasn't outstanding. My trout scramble was way too salty. My husband liked his smoked turkey club. The French toast was fine too.

We won't be back. It's a real shame because I like that they are trying to be really family-friendly and are trying to cater to former patrons of Farmhouse Tavern who now have kids strapped to their hips. But I still want the same service and quality that I get at Farmhouse, and that just isn't there."}
{"text":"Reservations for 8 on a freezing Saturday - the place was empty. We asked the waitress about the cocktails listed on the chalkboard and one of them she wasn't sure what was in it (and by the name of it, neither did we) -- and the second we asked about she said they couldn't make anymore because the guy who made it got fired. Awesome. So who's making our drinks? 

We order - my partner asks for his burger to be well done. We hear the waitress call it in -- and she asks for it to be well done.  But when it arrived it was like the cook had taken the bun and dipped it in blood.  Who serves a sopping wet bun? I'd expect that from a hot dog at AMC, but not this place. Needless to say -- the \"well done\" burger was less cooked than my non-well done burger. How unprofessional.

One of us had the steak and it was so tiny. It was like a salad that came with some steak instead of a steak with a side salad.  

Finally, we asked for the dessert menu and were told that they were sold out of all desserts.  We all looked around .. and thought, \"sold out -- how? there's no one here!\" -- so Happy Birthday -- you get no dessert -- thank goodness one of our friends had a chocolate bar in her purse, so we shared that -- why not? 

So .. The Daughter gets a bad review, and we'll never return because it's just not worth it.  We hear they do a great brunch - we hope that's true - but still, we care not to find out.  Good-bye Daughter -- we're not coming back."}
{"text":"Had lunch at the patio on a sunny day.  The food and drink menu was limited and printed on a piece of paper, I ordered Tavern Caesar and two pieces of Fish and Chips.  The skinny drink came with a pickled asparagus and a cocktail shrimp, it was made with tequila instead of vodka, not a fan of this mixture.  The fish was halibut, the pieces were meaty, the batter was crispy and a good ratio to the fish.  The fish and batter were not seasoned, the taste was bland without dipping into the tartar sauce.  The meal was ok, seemed a bit overpriced for the taste."}
{"text":"The food was good but service was extremely disappointing. Curt, bordering on rude, and a refusal to take responsibility for having taken an order wrong. Which, while bad on any given day, is worse when you've taken a friend visiting from out of town there as an example of all the great things in the neighbourhood. This place clearly isn't one of them."}
{"text":"All my Junction friends have been talking about the Farmer's Daughter for a while now.  We finally got to try it out for an early weekday dinner.  

Arriving around 5:30pm, our group of 4 adults and 2 stinkies had the choice of any table in the joint. They offered high chairs which we readily accepted, if only to cage in the toddlers.

Menu was pretty simple.  We ordered the fish & chips (one piece -$12), burger ($15) and kids mini-burger ($7).  Decent beer selection so we went with tall boys of the Farmer's Daughter's Ale ($6.50) and a scotch for the little one - er, I mean milk.

Service was swift and our order was out in good time.  The batter on the fish was pretty amazing - light, fluffy, not overly greasy.  But it was the burger that really stood out - perfectly cooked, juicy and flavourful!  I didn't get too many fries with my portion of fish & chips so I had to steal in on the fries that came with the burger.  The kids meal mini-burger came with veggies and dip as a side.

Farmer's Daughter has some really great specials including a beer/burger combo for $19 and buck-a-shuck but it's for the bar seats only, and they are really rigid in their rules.  I can see this for the weekend or at peak times but when it's Wednesday night and there is only 1 table occupied, I'd suggest maybe being a bit more lax on the rules to make the customers happy.

I really like Farmer's Daughters and really want them to succeed so that they will stay in the 'hood for a long time."}
{"text":"Came here for Canada day brunch!  Loved their simple hand written menu and the waiter was nice mouth to elaborate on it which helped with the decision making. The atmosphere is very relaxed,  people where there to enjoy the food and let loose. There's a patio too for nice weather. I had eggs Benny with bacon. I love their bacon....  Every thing on that plate was gone. Delicious!"}
{"text":"We ate here 2 weeks ago - We had a buttermilk powder dusted fried shrimp (delicious) and a 1/2 dozen oysters to start. My fiancee had the surf and turf burger (beef + battered fish onto) which was quite yummy. I ordered the halibut stuffed with blood sausage, onto of stinging nettle gnocchi. The dish looked beautiful with the vibrant green colour of the gnocchi. 
However, when I cut into the halibut, it was cold on the inside, transparent, and difficult to cut into, just like a piece of raw fish.  I realized that the entire dish had cooled down significantly, the gnocchi was not warm when i bit into it. I am never the type to send a dish back to the kitchen and usually takes a lot for me to do so. I decided I'd ask my waitress, who indeed brought the dish back. After waiting what felt like 30 minutes (my partner had already polished off his burger and i was starving), the chef personally came by with a new dish (this time the gnocchi was actually warm), and handed it to me from over the fence. She proceeded to tell me this is how the fish is supposed to be (seriously? it was transparent and cold.!I know my raw fish. I love sashimi!).  I have a feeling it was probably difficult to cook it thoroughly because it was so thick, and was stuffed... 
If you come here, one tip - do not order the halibut, unless you like half-cooked halibut."}
{"text":"The venue is not to my taste - it's something out of an 80's tron era, but to each their own. Play the appropriate music for it guys! The drive soundtrack for instance - not the same stuff as the tavern. 

The house Pinot was great.

Had the fish dish - it's rainbow trout confit - essentially rainbow trout that has hot fat poured over it to cook it. An interesting dish, quite delicious. 

It's odd to me that a place seemingly targeting seafood has only one \"fish dish\". No Arctic char? A cool twist on a deep fried piece of halibut? But, maybe, just maybe, you try something new? Octopus is all the rage now, right? 

I'll be back, it's worth it. Cool people, chefs that care about how it tastes, great hood."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch, we would recommend reservations as they are given the tables. We had good seats at one of the bar counters. I was surprised with how I liked the duck egg on the oeuf mollet and the croque madame was great. The potatoes are awesome!"}
{"text":"I don't know about you, but I have a lot of friends moving to The Junction lately. I must say, I like it. In the great Toronto debate, I prefer West to East, and I'm lovin' all of the sweet businesses popping up in this hood. It's much more first-time-biz-owner coffee shops than Starbucks, and I can dig.

Thank you, FDE for being open on Canada Day. Your patio was the perfect setting for a boozy brunch among friends. I enjoyed your daily feature, the strawberry french toast, and the others really seemed to enjoy their eggcellent creations. Also! Way to put a spicy, pickled asparagus in your Caesars. Classy touch."}
