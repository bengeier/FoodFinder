{"text":"Great bar and easy to dine in the bar. Wonderful food. High recommend: ribs, pork in lettuce leaf, Korean fried chicken. Friendly waiters, always accommodating."}
{"text":"VERDICT: The best meal I've had in Pittsburgh! Yes - this beats out the likes of Casbah, Eleven, Nine on Nine, and Tamari.  FOOD: Excellent. Having heard enough good things, we opted for the Omakase (chef's choice). Course after course of sensationally prepared sashimi and nigiri-sushi, with sauces that were flavorful enough to set off the fish, yet delicate enough not to overpower it.   Mr. Shu presented us with Maguro (Tuna), Hamachi (Yellowtail), Hirame (Fluke), Kanpachi (young Yellowtail), Saba (Mackerel) and a few others. Miso soup, of course. There was one cooked course - a buttery soft fillet of cod that simply melted in the mouth.  The culinary delights continued with desserts. I got the chocolate maki, which was rich and delicious. Thankfully, it was also the only time that maki made any sort of an appearance at the table. Truth be told, I was a little apprehensive that the Omakase would include a few courses of maki, especially since the table next to us seemed to be busy wolfing down California rolls.  All in all, an excellent tasting menu. Portion sizes were just right, with enough food to leave you happily sated, but not stuffed. I was surprised to see reviews complaining about the small portion sizes - sushi is not something that you traditionally expect to find in Cheesecake Factory size portions!  SERVICE: Service was about average. Servers were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable, but a little on the slow side. We had a reservation and we were seated within a few minutes. It took us a little while after we were seated for them to get our drink order and there were a few other times when we were looking for a server but couldn't find one.   AMBIANCE: This is really the only thing I'd knock about Umi. I feel like they had the potential to really go for an upscale Japanese look and didn't. Instead, it feels a bit haphazard, with a mish-mash of a traditional and contemporary that doesn't quite mesh. It's by no means bad though - it was comfortable and enjoyable - just not up to its potential.  BOTTOM LINE: This is a place you can take your friends who are visiting from NYC or Philly and have it more than hold its own. Do yourself a favor and skip the grocery store rolls and go for the Omakase."}
{"text":"I'm so incredibly blown away right now.. I've been wanting to try Umi for about 2.5 Years now. Finally...   WOW, such an amazing meal(s). We ordered in many rounds. Soups, umi cocktails, salads, sushi, sashimi, maki rolls, miso cod, edamame, and soba noodles. Each dish was prepared, cooked, and plated perfectly. I enjoyed the favor profiles of each dish and drink. Everyone working there welcomed us: Danielle, Mr. Shu, Larry, Mrs. Shu, and Jesse. These staff members are incredibly knowledgeable and are clearly proud to work their jobs. The staff, the food, and intimate atmosphere combination make for the perfect dinner.  I was so impressed. Can't wait to go back and enjoy another evening!"}
{"text":"We really wanted to like Umi since there were many good reviews. Unfortunately, we will not go back there. Each potion was very small and expensive. One of dishes we ordered was 'spicy tuna salad' and what it came was tiny potion of marinated tuna. It was good, but that's it. No greens whatsoever.   Most food came on a boring plain white plate: just like something we use at home everyday.  I probably would not care if it was $10 meal, but since they are charging a lot of money, presentation could be better.   Selection of sake was disappointing as well. They only had one mediocre quality sake and one type of sho chu. Perhaps customers prefer drinking something else.   Wine and Spirits Store on Penn Ave has much better selection of them.  Having said that, all seafood was fresh and good quality. So if you don't mind spending a lot of money to taste small potion of good quality seafood, Umi is a good place for you."}
{"text":"Based on past Yelp reviews, I had two main concerns with dining at Umi: the expense and the small portion sizes.  Luckily, neither of these turned out to be an issue.  In fact, my boyfriend and I were able leave feeling satisfied and without spending over $100 (not including tip).  Although I had heard rave reviews about the Omakase tasting menu, we decided to order off the menu.  We went with the Vegetable Tempura appetizer and ordered the sushi and sashimi platters to split as our entrees.  The platters both came with miso soup and ginger salad.  The sushi platter came with one small 6-piece maki roll and 8 pieces of sushi.  The sashimi platter was presented in a bowl of ice and consisted of five varieties of fish.  Everything was very tasty and obviously high-quality.  A pic of our order: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/umi-pittsburgh?select=AhZ3Ixr2boyQFTtvVKeQHg#AhZ3Ixr2boyQFTtvVKeQHg  At this point, we had eaten Vegetable Tempura, Miso Soup, Salad, and a variety of sushi and sashimi.  We were still a little hungry, but decided some dessert would do the trick.  We observed what some of the diners around us had ordered, and decided to go with the ice-cream sandwich dessert.  If the sushi and entree portions here are considered small, the dessert portions are definitely normal or even large.  The table next to us had ordered a delicious looking banana sundae with three scoops of ice-cream, and I've heard the chocolate pretzel dessert is awesome too...next time!  When it was all said and done, my boyfriend and I had ordered two drinks, an appetizer, soups and salads, two entrees, and dessert, all for about $98.  Not too bad, and probably comparable to other high-end restaurants in Pittsburgh.  My only complaints...I wish the lights had been a bit more dim, and we were absolutely freezing during our meal.  It seemed as though a door or window was open somewhere behind us and was letting in a gust of wintery air.  However, the ambiance overall was very enjoyable, and I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a date night or special occasion.  The free valet parking is a great perk too."}
{"text":"Trust Mr. Shu, get the omakase, sit back and relax.  I've gotten the omakase multiple times and it never disappoints.  I always end up getting some nigiri as well.  If I could eat here everyday, I would.  My only complaint is their drink service is quite slow.  I had a three hour long dinner and only received one cocktail.  I ordered a second cocktail halfway through the meal and by the time we were finished it hadn't arrived.  Whatever, I'm not a big drinker anyway."}
{"text":"Went to Umi last night, and it was tough to get a reservation, which is usually a good sign. But actually, in retrospect, its just a sign that people are not aware of the quality of sushi that can be found elsewhere in Pittsburgh. It was sad, really. We began with the miso soup, which was some of the best we have had. Nice and hot, and perfectly seasoned. But it was downhill from there. The salad was just ok. Mixed greens were wilted, but the dressing was tasty. We then moved on to the \"good stuff,\" or so we thought... We began with the highly-recommended \"yellowtail sashimi with yuzu jalape√±o sauce\" -- it was overly ceviche'd, and lost its freshness, replaced by a tough, dried-out quality. While a small sliver of jalapeno was a nice touch for sharpness, it didn't compensate for the poor quality preparation of the fish itself. We next had a spicy tuna roll (which, I think, is a barometer for sushi quality in any restaurant). It was dry and average, at best. Nothing special, but no egregious mistakes either. We moved on to the \"sushi entree (assorted)\", which had 8 pieces of assorted sushi, each consisting of a piece of fish: yellowtail prepared exactly like the previous dish but with rice this time; two pieces of salmon topped with (of all things) cream cheese and a cherry tomato (come on, this was so disappointingly reminiscent of brunch -- where's the caper and english muffin?; mackarel which was less-than-tasty, again topped with a dollup of something indistinct and non-complementary; tuna (average); red snapper maybe; and a paper-thin piece of mild whitefish, which tasted like rice, owing to its diminutive portioning; and a tuna maki roll, which was dry and shriveled and appeared limp, like it was prepared earlier that day. I was expecting an artful presentation, but was shocked at the lack of playful creativity that I, at that point, assumed might account for the inflated prices compared to other restaurants in the area (since the quality of flavor was actually MUCH poorer than other local places). Next to us was seated a couple on a date, where the man was clearly trying to impress his lady (both dressed very nicely and timidly fascinated by each other's every word and expression). I felt sorry for him, because he was either going to be disappointed with the meal itself, or oblivious to the fresh japanese seafood delights he could be exposing her to just a short drive away. THIS IS NOT A PLACE TO TAKE YOUR LOVE INTEREST, unless she is impressed simply by the magnitude of a check and a mere patina of fine dining. Our waitress was sweet, patient, and knowledgeable, and I couldn't help but wonder if she would recommend Umi to her family. I doubt it. We concluded with a dessert that was simply delicious, playful and contemporary -- and weren't surprised to find that the desserts are actually part of the menu of their \"sister-restaurant,\" Soba (which is a WONDERFUL place). It was the Soba Banana Split - an unusual and tantalizing update of the original (which, I believe, was originally invented in Pittsburgh). Overall, the portions were small and unsatisfying, which would've been ok if the flavors were outstanding, but they were not. Not at all! I was shocked, and realized that a restaurant that should be credited with exposing the local eaters to fine Japanese cuisine years ago, has fallen from its lofty perch atop Pittsburgh's international dining choices. And fallen far. So insular a chef can become when his cuisine is lauded for so long, that he can become ignorant of the ever-rising quality of his competition. I suggest Umi's chefs explore other restaurants and realize that they no longer have a monopoly on daily freshness, and that their creativity, like their salad, has become stale. To people seeking high-quality sushi in the area, I must strongly recommend Ichiban (in Aspinwall), and before you question my credibility in recommending a restaurant nestled in a strip mall, think about what makes sushi wonderful. If unwavering freshness, playful inventiveness and sense of fun mixed with elegant presentation and even nice wine pairings, exactness in execution and preparation, thoughtful proportions as well as portions are qualities that not only enhance experience but even define Japanese cuisine, then Ichiban gets it right. Umi, I'm afraid, is way past its prime. It's not that Umi is so bad. It's just not that good. Nothing special. I can say I have tried several other places in Pittsburgh, trying to find a suitable place to satisfy my frequent cravings for fresh raw seafood with a characteristically Japanese seriousness in its execution and levity of presentation and flavor combinations. Ichiban is the place that is consistently able to capture this \"essence\" of Japanese cuisine. But there are others that are also better than Umi, which should no longer, by any means, be considered a standard."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Pittsburgh. The white tuna was great! The portions are very small, so we kept ordering more and more dishes as we ate."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Pittsburgh that I've found so far.  So what qualifies me as knowing good sushi?  First off I'm Japanese American =)  Not saying that other ethnic backgrounds don't know what good sushi is.  By the reviews I can tell that they do.  But keep in mind I have been eating sushi my WHOLE LIFE!  The price of food is a little higher than one might expect  so if you're a casual sushi eater, you might think twice before coming here.  The restaurant setting feels pretty authentic.  Be sure to make reservations."}
{"text":"Delicious. We got a couple plates and just split them up... But the cucumber eel maki roll was perfect. Eel not too overpowering. Also the... Shoot I forget the name but it was the green something. Also very good. Quiet place. Good service.  Then we had an assorted tray of sashimi. A few weird ones but overall very good sushi."}
{"text":"We were in town for the Pitt game and were really craving sushi so we decided to try this place since it was highly rated on yelp and listed as one of the top 25 restaurants by Pittsburgh Magazine.  It's in a cool neighborhood with free valet which was nice since the parking was tight.  The restaurant is upstairs above Soba (which was also on the list and looked good).    The environment and decor is very nice.  Really relaxing and cool set up with great art and ambiance.  We went right for the omakase  as other patrons suggested.  It was good, 7 courses plus a desert.  The desserts however, were very good.  We had the banana split and the pretzel with chocolate ganache.  Both were very delicious but the pretzel stack really blew me away! I couldn't stop!  I would suggest this place for locals as well as visitors.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"After dining here on numerous occasions I decided to write a review..this place gets high marks for the quality of food.. First timers, just order the omakase and you will not be disappointed.. Mr Shu runs the show here and puts together a 7 or 11 course extravaganza. From the salmon tartar to the black cod with miso, everything is done to perfection and the quality is superb. The servers have been there for quite some time and know the dishes inside and out. We should all be so happy to have this gem of a restaurant here in the Burg!"}
{"text":"Tasty & fresh sushi!  The food is very nicely prepared & laid out before you with a fair amount of simplicity, no really outrageous creative plating going on.  The menu seemed fairly traditional, I don't recall seeing the more \"Americanized\" (what I consider) \"crazy\" rolls that many trendy sushi restaurants (like NYC's & PHL's Haru) offer.  And don't take that as a bad thing.  While I'll happily admit to liking those \"crazy Americanized\" rolls, its nice to find a great more traditional place out there.  From what I understand Mr Shu is very stringent in regards to his sushi standards, to the point that he does not allow his sous chefs to prepare sushi if he is not around to supervise.  The restaurant itself is small & cozy (& up a loooooooong flights of stairs) & without the loud banging tunes you find in the more trendy restaurants so that a great conversation is possible to have whether you're there on a date or catching up with a friend.  I wanted to try the omakase, but opted against it as Umi was my second dinner of the evening (I'm a pig, I know), however I have heard pretty mixed reviews on whether or not its worth it.  The service was simply OK.  Kind of slow.  No, more like definitely slow.  Nothing special.  Still gave the waitress a 20%+ tip though so obviously I still wouldn't call the service horrendous."}
{"text":"Best Japanese restaurant in town. Freshest sushi and sashimi. To those who are bold, savor the Uni, which is among the best you'll have at par with similar restaurants in San Francisco or New York. To those who prefer cooked food, there is a wide selection of noodles, and meat/fish dishes. The miso soups are simple but elegant, great appetizer or as savory refresher of one's palate between sashimi and main hot dish."}
{"text":"the best Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh, have to try the omakase which is absolutely deserve 100 bucks! Enjoy it"}
{"text":"The quality, taste of food, atmosphere and service are all great. I got the omakase and it was unreal. Only gave 4 stars bc it is super expensive here. It's worth a trip for the experience."}
{"text":"This place is a true example of how quality far exceeds quantity.  I've had the Omakase every single time I've gone there.  It's a bit overpriced considering you don't really get full after eating 8 courses. (Omakase = $80 not including tip)  However, the quality is AMAZING! The rock shrimp has a spicy crunch to it that is extremely addicting.  The deserts can be amazing depend on what you choose. The 3 varieties of pan seared sashimi is absolutely melt in your mouth good.  If they just gave you bigger pieces enough for you to be full by the time you leave, I'd give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Pittsburgh. Small restaurant so definitely make reservations and try the omakase. Like the tatami mat seating as well."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi in the city of Pittsburgh. I gave 4 stars and not 5 due to cost $$$$! We try to eat here at least 3 to 4 times a year. The sushi is the freshest and most tasteful. I lived in Los Angeles for 8 years and was spoiled the sushi restaurants.   I have introduced numerous friends to sushi at Umi that had never eaten Sushi before and now they love it. I have brought friends who thought their local place was good and I said that I am a sushi snob. Once they tried Umi they understood what I meant and how better their sushi was.   Try the spaghetti squid  along with the miso crusted black cod."}
{"text":"Over rated.  I paid double what I paid at a world class restraunt in Dubai, UAE.  Ridonkulas prices for then smallest portions of sushi ever.  I have been to other places way better taste and pricing.  Your paying for the city really.  I have a plate twice the size of what I got here.  Whst I got here cost me 150 bucks.  What I got at this other place.  75 after tip.  Taste = same."}
{"text":"Quality ingredients prepared perfectly. Excellent service, as well. Favorite sushi restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"First off, I cannot comment on the food.  I went on a Sat at 6.00 thinking it was early enough to not be too busy.  I had checked THEIR website about reservations and didn't see anything so assumed they didn't take them.  We wanted to sit at the bar anyway.  When we got there, the place was about 1/2 full at best.  He told us there were no open reservations until 9.00 (then why is the place half empty?)  That was fine by us, we wanted to be at the bar which had NO ONE AT IT.  He told us that to sit at the (empty) bar, we had to spend $50/person minimum.  WHAT?!  Now, I was prepared to spend some money, believe me, but what if I don't like the menu or I run out of time for dessert?  So, we weren't allowed to sit at the bar or a table.  We were pretty shocked so went somewhere else that didn't have a minimum spending to sit at a fuller bar.    I will never go back.  They completely turned two cute girls away that were ready to spend probably $80 in 45 min and had a pretentious attitude about it."}
{"text":"absolutely the best sushi in pittsburgh, maybe the best sushi west of the Appalachian Mountains. Amazing atmosphere, quiet dining to allow you to focus on how good the food you are eating really is. its pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"Yay for delicious sushi in Pittsburgh!  I haven't tried the omakase yet, but it looks mouth-wateringly good (and a really good deal compared to other cities where high end japanese restaurants are more common).  The chef's choice sushi is great if you don't want to go for the omakase.  The miso cod is delicious, as is everything else we have tried.  We will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to live in the San Francisco Bay Area, so our standards for sushi are very high.   Umi exceeds those standards. It is easily the finest quality fish we've ever had, consistently, in Pittsburgh. Ask what is fresh today. The miso cod makes me weep with its awesomeness, but does take some extra time to make, so warn them if you are in a hurry.  A good deal (for them) is to get rolls made into handrolls. So handrolls are about $5-7/roll, but pretty filling. Eat them as soon as you get them, because they toast the seaweed. So good! My husband gets spicy tuna handrolls and I get salmon/avocado handrolls.  The downside is that it is VERY pricey and the portions are small. If I could give this place a 4.5 stars for the portion size, I would.  The waitstaff are funny and attentive. At least, we seem to keep getting the same guy, and he recognizes us and laughs at us when we order a ton of handrolls.  I'm not keen on the tatami area--it's neither that comfortable nor a true tatami area, and it seems like a huge pain for the waitstaff to have to bend like that--but the setting itself is tranquil and lovely.  Reservations highly recommended. They do not do take-out because it ruins the quality of the food.  You can get desserts off the Soba menu downstairs. They are pretty uniformly tasty, ranging from super-sweet to barely sweet. I'm particularly partial to the chocolate mousse \"sushi,\"--e.g., thin cantaloupe slices as ginger, green tea mousse as pretend wasabi, etc.   If you want the best fresh raw fish in town, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I feel conflicted about Umi: while it has a lot of care and attention to detail such as smooth black stones to rest chopsticks on, tatami seating, concise but nice menu presentation etc. it seems to lack value on the food end. I greatly appreciate omakase options on a menu as I like this traditional Japanese style of conversation of chef to customer via food. As well their maki and sushi/sashimi section contain a selection of items that are a little more diverse than the average Pittsburgh sushi spot like Japanese uni and a seaweed-out roll with shiso inside. But I have to agree with some other reviewers that the price point is skewed.   I will say that our server was knowledgeable  -not being caught off-guard by anything I asked-  attentive, personable and gave recommendations based on a clear interest in the food being served which I find is crucial for me to trust my server. The interior was clean and had a consistent theme carried throughout the restaurant of a peaceful night garden, which made sense for the cuisine. Of the two cocktails I tried, the Thai Mule stood out as excellent despite not having a strong presence of the described Thai basil and the Szechuan Sour was good.  The the sushi shari is probably my personal favorite in Pittsburgh, extra salty and vinegary without being mushy, and the pressure in forming the other sushi items was precise. However the \"new style sashimi\" was underwhelming."}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi in Pittsburgh.  It's pricey, but worth it, the chef even uses the same fish supplier as Nobu, which explains how Pittsburgh can get a big city taste on our very own Ellsworth avenue."}
{"text":"Umi is a Big Burrito venture (a local restaurant group), which means you're guaranteed to pay a decent amount for your dinner and there's a decent chance your dinner is going to be worth it.  Some BB places are worth the cost and some aren't.  Umi, happily, is worth it.  It's still pricey, so this probably isn't the place to sate your random Thursday craving for sushi, but it is an excellent special occasion place for the sushi lover.  Up a few flights of stairs in a minimalist environment, Umi serves up excellent sushi (and a really nice octopus salad), including some higher quality varieties you can't always find in the mid-range places--toro and uni spring to mind.  This is not the kind of place you order chicken teriyaki (and if your date does order this, break up with him/her), Umi takes its suhsi seriously and the waitstaff is generally very helpful in navigating the menu, although I did have one experience there in which the waiter seemed like he was preening about his (legitimate) sushi knowledge.  The Omakase is expensive, but worth it.  But obviously, you can still have a great meal at Umi without dropping $75+ a head.  Excellent spot for a date or a small celebration."}
{"text":"I've been to Umi several times and I will say, it's always provided exceptional food. I will preface the review of the food by saying that if you're really hungry and expecting a meal that's going to fill you up, this isn't the place. This place strikes me more as an experience and small tastes of quality foods. During my many trips, I've tasted the following foods:  The assorted sushi: This has been my go-to for dinner. It provides a center roll, but the stars are truly the side fish provided to the side. Some are served with a touch of sauce particularly suited to the fish and they all seem to really jibe and add to the flavor.   Kobe Beef: The Beef is served raw and given a touch of wasabi and oil. The meat is so tender that it almost melts in your mouth.   Red Snapper: this dish is served in a similar manner as the Kobe. Drizzled with some truffle oil and sliced thinly. It's another case where the food is left to mostly speak for itself and it's delicious.  Rock Shrimp Tempura: This is sort of a take on bang-bang shrimp. Fried, but extremely light. Placed in a spicer sauce that's just exceptional all around."}
{"text":"My husband's family sings Umi's praises every time we talk about Pittsburgh and so we try to go every time we're in town. Last night's visit was my second and oh my god was it fantastic! We had impeccable service, great guidance from our waiter, Larry, and probably one of the best dinners I've ever had. We decided to do the seven course omakase tasting and were very, very pleased. There was a nice flow to the whole thing and each dish blew us away. Especially notable were the fluke, the white tuna (I will request this for my last meal on earth, if possible. Seriously.) and an oven roasted black cod. All of the dishes were inventive and deceptively simple. It was expensive, but totally worth it in my opinion. It would be hard to put together a filling dinner without spending a good amount of money, but I don't think Umi masquerades as a spot for cheap eats.  Overall, Umi lived up to our high expectations and we'll continue to make time to dine here every time we come to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi, very professional wait staff, but probably won't go back for a few reasons.    The restaurant is in Shadyside on the top floor of a 3 floor building.  Get ready to walk up two steep flights of steps.  I hope you have a reservation, because there is no waiting area at the top.  You have to walk aaallll the way back down 2 flights of steps and wait at the bar, then walk back up when your table is ready.  They won't let you sit at the sushi bar unless you order from some special menu.  It was just silly.  Wife and I each got a Sushi platter entree ($30).  It came with 8 small pieces of nigiri sushi and a salmon roll cut up into 6 small pieces.  Each piece of nigiri had a different garnish on it, such as garlic aioli, cream cheese etc.  This was a nice touch and enhanced the flavor a good bit.  It really was good sushi, but the quantity was about 4 nigiri pieces short of acceptable for me.  On the plus side, the platter includes miso soup & ginger salad.  I'll say this is a nice place, but it's just not for me.  I'd rather go to Sushi Kim in the Strip, get twice as much sushi for the money and have a table right away.  I spent over $70 here and left hungry.  How can I possibly go back?"}
{"text":"Ambiance, service and food A1!  The food was orgasmic and it was a very comfortable place to be able to talk with your friends, lighting was perfect and the service was exceptional. Very knowledgeable staff and had a lot of passion for what they do!"}
{"text":"I wish I could l leave a better review for Umi, since I have heard people leaving raving reviews. Unfortunately Umi has disappointed me.   I was told they have \"amazing sushi\" but all I got was good sushi. I could barely taste the fish since it was drowning in toppings. I wish they would have mentioned beforehand that it was not plain fish sushi.  But what really disappointed me was the portion sizes. We got 3-courses plus dessert and left feeling starved. We went directly to get burritos after we just had dinner here. Portion sizing are such a joke! I literally laughed when they set down my $25 appetizer that consisted of 2oz of raw fish.  I don't recommend Umi unless you want to go out to eat after you just went out to eat. Save your money and get real sushi somewhere better."}
{"text":"This is heather's son Travis. I love this place.   The atmosphere  is incredible. I feel like I'm actually in Japan. The food is also amazing. I recommend the yaki udon for anyone who loves noodles. I will definitely come back to my \"new favorite Japanese restaurant\" many times."}
{"text":"I've been an Umi devotee for a couple years now and firmly believe it's the best Japanese restaurant in town by a pretty substantial margin.  Why someone would ever go to Nakama over this is unfathomable.    Highlights include the kumamoto oyster (if you've never tried west coast oysters there's no better place to start), seaweed salad, miso black cod (one of my top 3 dishes in Pittsburgh), and the teriyaki salmon (far and away my favorite dish to ever fall under the often-abominable \"teriyaki\" moniker).  I've never gone for the omakase but I imagine there's very little chance of it sucking.  I also like the intimate space, the chopsticks-on-rock arrangement, and the floor seating (although if you're infirm or extremely awkward maybe go for one of the traditional tables...)"}
{"text":"This place has the absolute best food I've ever eaten, not just in the sushi category.  My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary and both had the omikase. We both love sushi and both agree that this was hands down the best sushi and Japanese food we ever had. BUT, the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the portion size. I was perfectly happy with the portion size but my boyfriend was not. I think the disappointment came more from his expectation of 7 courses of an American meal. I, however, was expecting portions smaller than the typical American meal.   The restaurant is pricey, but if you love sushi you have to go. The sauces perfectly complement the fish. The shrimp was absolutely perfectly cooked. The food itself is to die for and worth the price, just don't go expecting American size portions."}
{"text":"Date & Time of Visit:  May 21, Dinnertime  I don't know what this place was thinking with their eighty-five-dollar, eight-course tasting menu.  That menu had microscopic-size courses and the taste, after the first two (2) courses, were repetitive--and mostly on the sweet side.  Moreover, the place has the sticky feel that one would associate with divey restaurants.  As for their restroom, only one and a unisex one at that.  And yes, there was urine on the floor."}
{"text":"I'm very surprised at the quantity of low reviews for this place, as I think it has the best sushi in the city and is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Yes, it is pricey but I think it's safe to assume that the quality and freshness of fish here is a little bit higher than the stuff you see at your local Giant  Eagle.    I definitely suggest trying the Wasabi Tobiko ($4 per piece).  Such a unique piece of sushi, and one of the reasons I've been counting down the days until my next visit to Umi."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in town.  Here is the deal with Umi - if you are a casual sushi eater and just a fan of your basic rolls and stuff, don't bother going here.   Umi is expensive, rolls will seem small - same as the sashimi and nigiri.  However, it is so darn delicious I can't even describe it.  If I could, i would go to Umi every night.  It's simply that good.  It's well, well worth every cent you will spend.  Also, try the rock shrimp.  Oh man.  I think I am gonna go make a reservation right now."}
{"text":"this place never lets me down.  pricey for sushi in pgh, but worth it.  the omakase (sp?) is a party."}
{"text":"Yup! One of my favorite places in PGH.    The right combination of good service, nice ambiance, and that omakase!!  We usually opt for the 7 course tasting menu, which seems just enough without over doing it. Also, I'll  include edamame to start and a side of rice just because - it gives it more balance.   My fav is the black cod.  I've never had the sushi tho.    Most of my visits have been pleasant. I've had an issue with a server  but once it was brought to their attention, we were compensated with cocktails and a reduction in our check.  Overall, one of my favs places for date night or with friends!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious - and the prices is pretty up there too.  We had the 5 course chefs special. Everything was perfect.  The service was beyond superb. What a lovely place. If I lived in PGH I'd visit this place more often - if my checkbook would allow for it.  Pricey, fancy, fresh sushi - small servings - remember that if your hungry."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Mr. Shu is an artist.  I have been to Umi at least 40 times and have never had anything short of an excellent meal.  The service is always excellent and the fish shines every time.  If you have the time and can spring for it, the Omakase is a wonderful showcase of all Mr. Shu has to offer.  Some of my favorites include the Red Snapper with truffle, the Black Cod, the squid \"pasta\", and, of course, the salmon sushi, which my close friend and I simply call \"crack\"."}
{"text":"I'm really struggling with my rating for this restaurant because the food tasted good, the service and space were both excellent, but the pricing was outrageous for the tiny portions. So outrageous that I will definitely never return unless I have a gift card or discount. My husband and I had the 7 course ($90 each) tasting menu and we were still hungry when we left. I read other reviews and was prepared to see tiny, yet expensive dishes. So luckily, we had a gift card that allowed us to enjoy this experience at half the price.   Each of the seven dishes tasted great. They weren't exceptionally presented, but that doesn't really matter to me. No joke, every single dish that came out was only, ONLY 4 bites! (Maybe one of those dishes had 6 bites, but still) So lets do the math: 4x7=28 bites in the entire meal. Each dish was delicious, however. They really know how highlight the flavors of the different fish.   My overall rating would probably be 3.5 stars. The food is delicious, but expect to leave hungry."}
{"text":"Umi is alright.  What I mean by this is that the food is high quality, and the service is high quality, but for some reason, I'm never completely satisfied when I leave.  Let's start with the good:  They have great quality sushi.  They have interesting taste combinations.  The decor is fun, especially if you sit in the \"traditional\" seating area where you don't actually sit on the floor (if you can ever manage to get in and out of this seating in a graceful manner, kudos to you).    But, the portions are small, and every time we've eaten here, we come away with the sense of, \"great meal, but holy moly.  Dunno if it was $XXX good.\"  We'll continue to come, but probably only if someone else is paying.  In the meantime, it's off to Tamari we go."}
{"text":"Been a year since the first time i went to umi with a friend - my wife and i hit it this time and i felt really silly when the bill came. Best sushi in pittsburgh? Uh no. As other reviews stated; hilariously over priced, small portions, sushi is drowned in sauce and on this night, service not up to the crazy prices. Drinks served from Soba are outstanding though.   After we had already thrown $100 into the food i accepted that i was not gonna be anywhere near full - i like eel so i ordered a couple pieces for $5 each. When they delivered the eel, my wife laughed at the eel slivers that might be categorized better as molecular gastronomy.  Im not gonna document each item - but their rainbow roll - once again, small amounts of fish, lots of rice and veggies for $27. Now go have the same roll at penn ave fish or little tokyo lebo and you get a generous roll of fresh fish for half the price.   Understandably you may want to see for yourself - just go for a lite appetizer at the bar instead of dropping a small fortune for an underwhelming dinner."}
{"text":"Disappointment does not even begin to describe the feeling we felt as we progressed through our 11 course omakase.   There was very little variety between the courses with 4-5 courses of the 11 course meal consisting of 3 thin slices of fish (we got Spanish mackerel and red snapper each twice) with some sauce drizzled over. The sauce on many of the courses could be best described as overly sweet soy sauce that overwhelmed whatever taste the fish would have had.   Unlike most sushi omakase's where the meal focuses on the nigiri, there was exactly one nigiri course with 5 pieces. The most disappointing part of the night was probably the salmon nigiri with cream cheese. I don't think I've ever seen a respectable omakase serve nigiri with cream cheese.  Overall, the service was fast and friendly, but I strongly recommend anyone looking for decent sushi to look elsewhere. For $130/person, you can eat at Michelin starred sushi restaurants and have a much much better experience."}
{"text":"Paid $1100 for the required course - party of 6 - and unfortunately did not come close to feeling satisfied in any regard - sorry guys - not a fan and way overpriced"}
{"text":"It was my first time there and it was the best experience! Service was not only excellent, but the sushi was too!! Needless to say the money was well worth it. We got the 11 course omakase dinner. Gotta try it once for sure. Trust me its worth it. I had a couple of favorites: fried rock shrimp, cod fish in a lemon-y butter sauce that just melts in your mouth, lobster and kobe beef.. thats all i can remember for now. Sorry! Just trust me it was amazing..."}
{"text":"Anyone who says that there's no good sushi in Pittsburgh (and I've heard you say it, folks, right here on Yelp!) hasn't been to Umi yet. I'd been mostly satisfied, sushi-wise, by quality if standard places like Little Tokyo in the South Side and Chaya in Squirrel Hill before I went to Umi with my roommate last Saturday.   The first major difference between Umi and the places mentioned above: price. Umi, a Big Burrito joint, is much more expensive than other sushi places in town. That said, if you have the dough, go for the $75/person omakase. We enjoyed eight courses (7 dinner + 1 dessert course), each one subtle and well-seasoned and incredibly fresh. (Now we're broke, but that's my cross to bear.) The black cod and the nigiri course were stand-out favorites. The prices on the a-la-carte sushi, in contrast, looked only slightly more costly than others in town.  The second difference: innovation. Sometimes, I just want straight-up, unadorned sushi, and when I do, I doubt I'll come back to Umi. However, if I'm looking for a fine dining experience, one where the ingredients are creative and innovative, I'll definitely return here. One of the best meals I've had in PGH yet!  A final caveat: don't forget to make a reservation. The restaurant was packed when we were there, and due to its small size, I doubt they can squeeze too many walk-ins in on a busy night."}
{"text":"Very tasty food, but nothing spectacular is the final verdict I have to give to Umi.  We did the full tasting menu which had plenty of food and sashimi. The combinations of the cuts of fish with the sauces the chef adds do taste delicious, but as it went on, it became clear that almost everything had a sweet flavor. There wasn't a lot of distinction from 1 fish to the next. Presentation was also very simple, I feel like more could've been done than 3 pieces of sashimi laid next to each other.  As I said it did still taste very delicious overall, but for a 5 star, I would expect a little more in terms of presentation and creativity for the price point."}
{"text":"Wow, what a phenomenal dining experience. I was visiting Pittsburgh for my birthday and went with my two close girlfriends. I am a big Japanese fan, and when I saw they offered omakase, I knew I had struck gold! Beautiful ambience and setting, and good service. I started with the shrimp gyoza, DELICIOUS and hot! Then we got some rolls (eel and cucumber, california, and I think my friend got the spicy tuna) . All were delicious and of extremely high quality and had the very authentic small amount of rice around the roll, superb. I got the black cod with miso for my entree and it was also amazing. Piping hot, well seasoned and not too salty whatsoever. Dessert was their pretzel stack, which was insanely tasty and cleansing after some fish. Overall, I would return in a heartbeat and wish I lived next to an Umi in the DC area!! Worth every penny considering this is better than any Japanese I have eaten at in DC and rivals all the ones I have eaten at in NYC and LA.  MUST GO!!!"}
{"text":"I have going to this place for years and it never disappoints! The food is excellent and unique. This not just your typical sushi place it has a full spectrum of Japaness dishes. The seven course omakase is amazing! The sauces that come along with the fish are to die for! The prices are high but they come with an awesome experience (both ambiance and staff) and flavors you can't get anywhere else in Pittsburgh. It doesn't hurt that you can also get the desserts from Soba which are some of my favorite in the city."}
{"text":"Went to Umi last night on a first date.  The wine was delicious, had two glasses of Sauvignon Blanc, and ordered 4 rolls to share.  Spicy Tuna was delicious, there was no spicy mayo, but it didn't even need it.  The spicy softshell crab roll was amazing and i stuffed it into my mouth as usual because its a larger sized sushi.  The most delicious was the Eel and cucumber roll.  The other was the green fuji, this was different and delicious.  For dessert we ordered the chocolate covered pretzel and it was out of this world.  Chocolate mousse, chocolate salty pretzel rounds stacked on top of each other with caramel drizzled over the entire thing.  I'd go back just for dessert.  I'd also like to try some entrees but we were there just for sushi.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I love coming to Umi to celebrate any occasion, big or small. It's become a fun celebratory spot for my husband and me. We find it's possible to get out without spending an arm and a leg if you do it right. Don't expect to get stuffed, or else you will be spending beaucoup bucks. But like I said, it is possible to eat here for a reasonably. I recommend starting with a starter such as the tuna sashimi, but don't waste $7 on edamame that you could buy at Trader Joes. Then start with 6 or so rolls. You can always order more later if you are still hungry.  I love the Pinot Gris by the glass from the Willamette Valley. Its crisp acidity goes perfectly with maki rolls and sushi.  The white tuna sashimi is a perfect starter. My mom (who hated anything resembling raw fish before coming to Umi) couldn't get enough of this. It's a must.  The white fish and mint is my favorite roll. Something about the brightness of the mint against the subtle, freshness of the white fish makes this roll absolutely to die for. I also can't get enough of the salmon sushi. It's topped with cream cheese and cherry tomato. Our waiter recommended it to me once, and I have to order at least one piece every time I go!  They use Soba's dessert menu, so it's great that I can get all my favorite Soba desserts when I come to Umi."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for a special dinner. I've been here twice, and on both occasions had a wonderful three hour long dinner. The food is delicious, the atmosphere is pleasant and relaxed feeling, and the waitstaff are friendly. My only complaint about Umi is the exorbitant price!"}
{"text":"Two hours of new and delicious flavor.  Got the omakase 11 course menu.  Small portions of some of the most delicious seafood I've ever tasted.  The cod dish was in the top 5 things I've ever put in my mouth.  If you're trying to discover the whole food scene in Pittsburgh, save up for this one and try it once.  You'll leave having had an experience that doesn't involve that stuffed feeling you'll be getting other places."}
{"text":"Umi has Pittsburghs best Sushi.  Quant location in Shadyside offering two levels of seating. Intimate setting; great for dates! The food selection is designed to intrigue your test buds while offering you an outstanding experience."}
{"text":"I ate here this past Friday evening with my girlfriend for dinner.  We decided to come here since it was the last of the Big Burrito restaurants that my girlfriend had not tried.  The inside of the restaurant is quaint with a sushi bar on one side where you can watch Mr. Shu ply his craft and many tables on the other longer side of the restaurant.  There are also a decent amount of sheet metal fish sculptures throughout the restaurant which I enjoyed looking at.  Whenever our server came over, we queried him about a few of the Umi specials and in addition to the information about the dishes he told us that they were essentially big appetizers which was good to know.  After hearing that we decided to start off our meals with the sawara with garlic ponzu and squid pasta with garlic sauce.  Since we had also both ordered entrees with my girlfriend getting the terayaki salmon and myself the seafood tempura with a side spicy tuna maki, our meals actually started with a miso soup and ginger dressing salad.  There was nothing special with either although I do always enjoy both at many sushi places. Soon after we finished those the sawara came out and it was a Spanish Mackeral cut into 7 pieces with a tiny sliver of raw garlic on top surrounding the garlic ponzu.  We were instructed to wrap the fish around the garlic and dip it into the sauce which we both did.  The combined flavors were very enjoyable with the standout being the sauce.  After that our squid pasta came out which was some squid that looked julienned and then seared with some shitaki mushrooms and asparagus on top of a bed of garlic sauce.  This dish was interesting for me as I was not a big fan of having the squid in the sauce alone but really enjoyed it whenever I combined it with some of the vegetables.  The Shitake mushrooms might actually have been the best that I have ever had as they seemed to melt in your mouth.  After we had finished the plate our server ended up bringing out a side of rice onto which he poured the sauce from our now empty dish.  In doing so he explained that the sauce was too good to waste.  After trying the sauce covered rice my girlfriend and I both readily agreed with him.  Finally after making our way through all of the other courses, our entrees came out.  My seafood tempura ended up consisting of broccoli, asparagus, crab, fake crab and a single piece of fish all breaded in tempura with a side of soy sauce.  This dish was actually the biggest disappointment of the evening for me for a few reasons including the single piece of fish and also that it seemed to lack the depth of flavors that the rest of the dishes so nicely displayed.  Thankfully my maki was delivered at the same time and had a flavor punch that diverted me from the much more vanilla tempura.  Since I am not a huge fan of salmon I did not try my girlfriends dish but she did assure me that she enjoyed it whenever I asked her about it.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely be back in the future.  I am not so sure that I would order an entree again but I would certainly love to try more of their creations and could probably make a meal of their maki and sushi."}
{"text":"I used to go to Chaya in Squirrel Hill at least once a week, but since I've moved this past summer, it's been difficult to enjoy sushi as frequently.  Thus, I decided to test out Umi based on the good reviews I found on the web.  Sadly, I was grossly disappointed.  The interior decor is pretentious (large water fountain in the middle of the dining room and \"Japanese style\" paintings and decorations throughout) and dark (who likes eating in a place where you can barely see your food?).  The sushi was okay at best, but the quality of the fish certainly does not even come close to Chaya's.  The dishes were overpriced for the quality of the food, basically you'd be paying for the fake ambiance.  I guess the waiter was nice in that he tried to explain our dishes, but frankly he does not know too much.  This is one of those Americanized versions of an Asian restaurant and not authentic (key indicator: most of the patrons were not Asian).  It was nothing that would make me want to come back."}
{"text":"Excellent cocktail menu first of all, followed by an excting dinner menu that has not failed yet. Sushi has always been fresh and perfectly presented. I've made this a regular on my dining rotation."}
{"text":"I must say, this place has my attention. What great food. Apart from Yellow Tail in The Bellagio, this was my favorite sushi experience in America.   We let our server choose all of our courses. Had about 10 of them. Every one better than the next. People moaning about portions or cost need to go to Nakama and have crap rolls for $10. If you want decadence and creativity in your fish then go here.   True too of the line food. I was blown away at how my taste buds reacted from the dishes here. Can't wait to go back. Service was spot on."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite place when we first moved to Pittsburgh two years ago.  It had good quality fish and a nice atmosphere/cool staff.  As of our last visit, about two months, ago, the menu still had not changed, the portions of fish were smaller while prices stayed the same, and the atmosphere was on par with that of a Hofbrauhaus.  A drunken man knocked into our table on his way storming out of the restaurant which was immediately proceeded by the members of two different large tables rising from their chairs and yelling obscenities at each other.  It literally looked like there was going to be a brawl.  The members of these tables fairly quickly left the restaurant; however, the staff and manager simply acted as if nothing had happened.  No one came by to see if things had spilled on our table which was run into.  It was absolutely not the experience we expected to have, and it is a disappointment that this place has gone downhill."}
{"text":"One of the best Sushi experience I had so far. I was on a short visit to Pittsburgh and looking for a good sushi joint for dinner, went by the yelp reviews and as always it was a good experience.   I tried their sushi (assorted) which comes with soup and salad. Soup and salad were amazing to start with and sushi combination was pretty good. Overall with couple of drinks it costed me 50$ but it was worthwhile i would say  Service was very professional and attentive, and the overall ambience was awesome.  I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys good sushi."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time, very impressed, let the chef chose and we were very pleased with the taste, selection and presentation.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"The specials (especially the Rock Shrimp Tempura) were great. The sushis were good but nothing out-of-this world. All the food tasted great and the service was good.  The biggest problem was with the sizes of portions. We left hungry while paying something north of $100 for two, excluding tip. So it was a bit overpriced.  You definitely should try, but keep looking for other Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"I'm so torn!  I thoroughly enjoyed Umi and really want to give it five stars, but I had to deduct one because of the \"would I go back\" factor.   Here's what you need to know:  - The food is amazing.   I had the rock shrimp and the sushi dinner.   Every bite was amazing.   The sushi was super fresh and the inventive little touches of sauce, herb, etc. were bright and flavorful.  The rock shrimp were perfectly done with just a touch of spice.   The ginger dressing was awesome and even the soup seemed a little superior.    - The service is amazing.  Darryl was delightful.  Attentive, friendly, professional, and informative.  He took his time explaining the menu and making recommendations.  At the end of the meal, he refilled water glasses without a word while we lingered just a bit (it wasn't busy).    - The atmosphere is amazing.  It has an authentic feel and with nice accents and dim lighting to set the mood.   - The prices are INSANE.  Picture a \"normal\" sushi restaurant, then cut the portions in half and double the prices - that's basically what you have here.  The food was fantastic, don't get me wrong, but I disagree with the reviews that say it's worth the money.   It's just not.   Nigiri is $5-$8 per piece (very small pieces - easily one bite).  Maki goes all the way up to $27 for a rainbow roll or dragon roll, which are both pretty small for that price tag.  Entrees are also small portions and only a handful of them come with the soup and salad to round out the meal.  The omakase tasting menus range from $90-$130 per person.  Overall, expect to spend 3-4 times the amount that you'd normally spend on a good sushi dinner that won't leave you wanting a snack on the way home.  I just can't justify it.      - They offer valet parking in the lot, but then it's a trek up two long flights of stairs - not for the elderly or injured, for sure.     All in all, I had an amazing meal and loved the atmosphere, but this place is crazy overpriced to the point that I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"I believe I've found my new favorite restaurant. After being rather dissapointed with Chaya last night, I decided to go to Umi tonight.  The staff was friendly and service perfect. There servers watch for you to dictate the pace of the meal.  Beggining with the typical salad with ginger dressing: I was very happy with this dressing, just about perfect.  Next the miso soup: I'm not generally a huge fan of miso soup, but this was probably the best preparation I've had. I could have gone for another bowl.   For my entree I chose the dinner sushi assortment. This was by far the best sushi I've ever tasted. As cliche as it may sound, every piece (including fin which is notoriously tough) was melt in your mouth good.  The accompanying sauces are not overbearing in the least, they merely enhance the flavor of the fish.  The pieces of nigiri themselves are bite size - as in 1 bite without looking like you're stuffing your mouth.  This is smaller than the giant balls of rice with large cuts of fish you often times see at other places. I rather enjoyed the size, but just wanted to make note of it. The tuna roll was also very tasty. I did not sample any other rolls tonight, but I'm sure I will be back to do so.  My dining companion had the chicken teriyaki.  The dish came out sizzeling from the back kitchen.  Again, this was probably the best preperation of the dish I've ever tasted. The serving size was perfect, about 5oz of very tender breast meat, with accompanying vegetables and a small side of rice.  More than enough to satiate, without the need for a nap afterwards.   I didn't sample the desserts tonight, but I've seen others rave about them. I will definitely be back, as often as I can. I don't really care to try sushi anywhere else in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there last night and it was so good I can't stop thinking about it.  Even if I could stop thinking about that dinner, I'll be reminded of it every time I check my bank account balance because Umi must be the Japanese word for \"you think you can afford this, but you cannot.\"  I will absolutely dine at Umi again.  I wish I'd ordered the Omakase, which is $85 but provides a sampling of everything and from the other reviews here it looks like a lot of people recommend it.  I advise ordering the Omakase because while $85 seems pricey, you're bil is going to be close that anyway.  I know I keep talking about money and it makes me sound like a peasant, but having abject sticker shock at the end of any dining experience is never fun.  It was, however, worth it.  My friend and I ordered a bunch of different things and everything was EXCELLENT!  We had:  vegetable tempura miso soup white tuna sashimi which basically melts in your mouth tuna tataki salmon with mushroom sashimi sawara w garlic ponzu which was good but we found the garlic a little overwhelming california rolls tuna and cucumber rolls spicy tuna rolls at least 4 carafs of sake  I highly recommend this place, this would be a good place to go on a date if you aren't paying or if you are traveling with a corporate credit card.    MAKE RESERVATIONS.  We were there on a Wednesday and the guy who answered the phone to take my reservation acted like he was doing me a favor to fit me in.  It was a little crowded, but we were able to sit at a tatami table.  Pro tip:  Wear pants.  A family w kids sat at the tatami table across from us and it was a bitch to get out of the tatami table while wearing a maxi dress without flashing everyone. Which is impressive since it was a long skirt.  In summary:  Go to Umi, but only if you aren't paying.  Trust your servers recommendations, and get the Salmon & Mushroom sashimi"}
{"text":"Will never eat at another sushi place in Pittsburgh after eating here. Quality is comparable to Nobu."}
{"text":"i've been to Umi for sushi several times and haven't been disappointed in the quality of the fish.  yes, it's delicious and high quality food.. so why the four stars you ask?   because it's just a bit too pretentious for my taste.  yes, it's great quality fish and yes, the decor is very traditionally beautiful japanese... but what you read about the snobbery is true... 50$pp minimum @ the sushi bar? please.    i agree with a previous reviewer, it's beautiful, high quality food and service... but i always leave feeling like something is missing."}
{"text":"This is the BEST sushi in Pittsburgh EVER.. probably the best sushi I've ever had in my life!  My boyfriend and I are huge foodies and we make sure we always go to the best in every city we go to. Being from New York and San Francisco, we've had our share of sushi. From Nobu to Morimoto to Sushi of Gari in New York, I would say Dr. Shu at Umi blows them out of the water!  We've always gotten the tasting menu- except twice (we've been there a dozen of times). Although very overpriced, I would say only go here if you are ready to dish out the money and you would truly appreciate the value of the sushi you are getting.  If you think Chaya has pretty good sushi and you're happy with their prices, I would say stick to Chaya. You really need to appreciate good sushi and KNOW what good sushi is if you are visiting Umi.   I would say that Umi is one of the best restaurants I've been to. It's up there with Le Cirque at Bellagio and the Four Seasons in Florence Italy. Yes, Umi is that good."}
{"text":"Went to this place with my friends. Everything we had was amazing. The appetizers were delicious. This is what I ordered: 1. Miso Soup: Was awesome!!!! very flavorful. My only complaint is there wasn't enough Wakame for my likening. But over all, it was AWESOME!!   1. Black cod with Miso: This fish was cooked perfectly and literally melted in the mouth. The flavor was mild and perfect.   2. Tuna Tataki: This was slices of Ahi Tuna slightly seared from the outside and rare in the inside. It was to die for!!!   3. Shrimp and Asparagus Maki roll: Probably not a great choice to begin with, this was okay, nothing to rave about.   4. Fuji Maki Roll: This had Crab and avocado and sesame seeds on the outside. It was delicious!!!   5. My friend had the assorted Sashimi. The serving was huge so i got to try some of his stuff. The white tuna was delicious as was the salmon."}
{"text":"Visit 1 - We ordered the 11-course omakase. We enjoyed the sushi, and our waiter was very nice. Visit 2 - We again ordered the 11-course omakase. The sushi tasted very good again, but our waitress had a slightly cold personality. Visit 3 - We ordered teriyaki salmon and teriyaki strip steak. We felt disappointed with the mediocre taste of the food. We could have eaten better-tasting teriyaki at other restaurants that cost a fraction of the price. The waiter was a little slow and tended more to the table next to us.  We will return at least one more time, and we will be sure to order what this business does best: sushi."}
{"text":"I always make it a point to try two types of restaurants when I am in a new city. One being the local flavor and the second being their so called best Sushi/Japanese Restaurant  After doing a lot of investigating I found the Big Burrito Restaurant Group, they have six different places to eat with cool names such as Kaya, Eleven, Soba, Umi, Mad Mex, Casbah and all had pretty good reviews on Yelp. Not that I specifically go by Yelp to make my choices but it is one of my tools  Anyway this evening I went to Umi. It is located in the same building as Soba and you walk to the third floor. After reading the reviews, I was worried about not having reservations, but knew I could always sit at the Sushi Counter if it came to it.  Upon entering the Sushi counter is in full view with a podium to the left where the host stands.  I said one please, (place was empty) and he said I could have a table or sit at the sushi bar with a $50 minimum.  Well I wipe my ass with $50 so it did not matter and I decided to take the table.  The place is small, it is cute. I ordered hot tea and water. First to note that tea was lame. Not your typical green tea or roasted tea one would get in a Japanese/Sushi restaurant, more like a Lipton tea...oh well  I started with the Shrimp Gyoza. Bad mistake, they were browned on the outside but raw parts of the inside.  The dipping sauce on the side was just plain bad.  Next came the squid \"pasta\" with garlic sauce.  It was four or five thinly sliced pieces of squid with garlic sauce on top of them...boring presentation, equaling a bore to eat.  Miso soup arrived next and I never had a pathetic miso in my life. Even the dried packages you buy at the Japanese supermarket are tastier than this. I was amazed, horrified, miso so bad  tako su (octopus salad), make with broccoli and sauce, to be honest I thought it was stir fried the sauce was so deep on this salad.   The Spicy tuna roll was one of the second worst I have had in the United States. I had a better Spicy Tuna Roll in Vientiane which is the capitol of Laos. The presentation was horrible; taste was boring, not spicy at all. Man one of the top three worst I ever had.  Sushi ordered the following 2 pieces each Tuna Yellow Tail Salmon Egg Sea Urchin Unagi Salmon Smoked Salmon  In regard to the sushi and all of the food above, on their menu and on their website they have the following:  umi is proud to feature many items previously unavailable in the area, our commitment to quality ingredients assures freshness. our fish is flown in from across the world for our pittsburgh location, allowing us an uncompromised selection -- at times leading to slightly higher pricing to ensure freshness and quality. we continue to introduce the area to new ideas and new concepts in dining. we thank you for your continued support and hope you enjoy your meal. if there are any special requests to make your dining experience more pleasurable, please ask. we will try our best to meet your needs  I challenge the Big Burrito Group on removing that due to it being bullcrap. I have had over 500 different tastings throughout the world at different Japanese Sushi establishments, I know about quality and about price.  This entire meal with tax $124. 12. I am fortunate enough to be a \"have\" and the price is not what upsets me. What rubs me the wrong way is that for such poor quality of food and mediocre service they use the line that \"our commitment to quality ingredients assures freshness. our fish is flown in from across the world for our Pittsburgh location, allowing us an uncompromised selection -- at times leading to slightly higher pricing to ensure freshness and quality.\"  Oh stop the fraud right now!  Just stop it!  I will say that the people of Pittsburg are kind, they are nice people, they deserve much better.    My review of Umi is boo hoo, would have given it one star but will give it two because I did not get sick.  For anyone that knows Japanese food, or food of quality..go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to trying Umi as I had heard great things! However I was disappointed- mostly with the ambiance and portions. We went on a beautiful fall night; however, the place was empty. I am always skeptical when is a restaurant isn't bustling with people!   For appetizer, I ordered the lobster miso. Highly recommend the lobster miso as there was a decent amount of lobster in the soup.   For my meal, I ordered the black cod with miso. The quality of the fish was incredible! However, the portion was tiny. I was not satisfied after my meal. Looking back, I should have ordered a side of rice to complete my meal. My boyfriend ordered the sushi platter which was much better value for your money. If I go back, I will definitely order that.   What did fill me up was the dessert: the chocolate pretzel. It looked like a work of art when it arrived but of course was demolished in under 10 minutes by my fork!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Umi for what seems like forever, since I am a huge fan of Soba downstairs. But it just seemed like I didn't have a reason since this is such a \"special occassion\" type of place. So I was super excited when Sheryl T. organized a UYE here. I wanted to let the dinner marinate in my head a bit before writing the review (well actually, I've just been really lazy and terrible at writing reviews lately), and I'm not exactly sure what to say about it other than it was outstanding.  Most of us did the 8-course omakase. The portions are interesting, it starts out with a couple very small plates (tartare, sashimi) and you're thinking like, \"oh my god, I'm going to be so hungry after this.\" But they get more substantial with some nigiri and a couple warm plates, and finally a gigantic dessert and at this point you're like, \"oh my god, that was way too much food.\" Overall, the tasting menu played out nicely. My faves were the nigiri (creative, but in a way that pays homage to sushi rather than bastardizing it...not that I don't like spicy-tuna-fried-scallop-topped-with-tuna-tataki etc etc...but this is not the place for that), the miso black cod (simple, but done well), and the rock shrimp tempura (the sauce was a little heavy for me, but the shrimp itself was light and succulent in a way that I didn't know deep-fried food could possibly be).  The desserts are the same ones found on Soba's menu and as I said, they are pretty rich and ridiculous. Actually, if I had any one thing i'd change, it would be that I would prefer a lighter dessert to complement the type of food here, but that could be because I'm just not a big dessert person. But it was pretty awesome to get to try every dessert on the menu! (I guess that's what happens when six ladies go out to dinner together...haha)  I would definitely come back again, although it is very pricey so it's not so much a place to come and stuff your face with maki, and more of a birthday/anniversary/graduation/other major life event celebration spot. So, I guess I just need to find an excuse to come back. Thanks again for organizing, Sheryl!!"}
{"text":"While the food is delicious, portions are extremely small. You will need to buy many dishes to feel somewhat full. Even their sushi is smaller then what you will find anywhere else, including high end restaurants in NYC."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. I've never been even slightly disappointed. I've been coming here with a good friend for a few years, and it's a MUST every time I come back to town for a visit.   On our most recent visit I had the sushi platter entree. It comes with 8 pieces of nigiri sushi and a maki roll in the middle. The salmon nigiri is incredible. Eat it slowly.  SAVOR it!  I'm thinking about going back just for that one more time before I head back to Arizona.   Also, their desserts are exquisite.  The dessert menu changes, but again, I've never even come close to feeling disappointed.  I don't care much for sweets but the dessert here is SO good that I order something every time.    P.S. Don't wear a short skirt in case you get seated at a tatami table!"}
{"text":"Best sushi ever. We got the Green Fuji and salmon avocado rolls. Best sushi I've ever had. Good service, small and not overcrowded, however the tables could be a little bit farther apart. I don't like hearing the next table's conversation. Valet parking is also free. A great dining experience and I will be back."}
{"text":"This may be too harsh, but I think Umi is the only Pittsburgh restaurant that can rival other restaurants of the same culinary category in major U.S. cities. Perhaps not too surprisingly, it is reminiscent of Morimoto of Philadelphia (Umi's Executive Chef, Mr. Shu, is said to have apprenticed under the famed Iron Chef).  The menu is not cheap. Since I only go when I'm in the mood to splurge, I've only ever ordered the omakasi (tasting menu). Actually, in the market of tasting menus, a set that is still under $100 is arguably a bargain.   Mr. Shu uses fresh and high quality ingredients, and he prepares the dishes with a light sophisticated touch. Of the multiple courses, my favorites are the tuna tartar and the kobe steak.  If I have to point to a weakness, it is that Mr. Shu's range is relatively narrow.  A bit more variety could really bring the meal to a whole new level."}
{"text":"Absolutely superb!  The price tag is a bit steep but I was prepared after reading reviews first.  I will say, I am not a sushi, sashimi or even a seafood connoisseur but Umi has opened my eyes--or at least broadened their view (and tastebuds)--to these wonderful foods.  I always stick to the boring rolls i.e. Cali, Boston, Alaskan etc. but coming here I knew I had to branch out and actually try some of the raw stuff.  I had the 7 course and it was AUH MAY ZING.  I hate \"fishy\" tasting dishes and none of the courses even resembled the taste seafood (unless you chose to eat the black cod with the skin).  My favorites were the tartare, the black cod and the sashimi at the end.  If you are iffy about sushi/seafood this is the place you need to be to try it!  My boyfriend hates sushi so I made dinner reservations for this Friday so he can taste how great 'real' sushi is.  He's reluctant to try but I know he's going to love it once he does!"}
{"text":"Easily the best sushi I have had in Pittsburgh.  The sushi is incredibly fresh, flown in daily from New York City, and the inverted tables make it a fun place to eat.  The staff was incredibly friendly and understanding when I wasn't sure what to do with the warm napkin upon sitting down.  Although it is pricey, if you are looking for a special night out I would highly recommend Umi."}
{"text":"Awful ! Never again !!!!! I had like 4piece of sushi and 1roll but they only give 2small piece of ginger ! Food was super expensive  But atmosphere is nice and server ben is knowledgeable"}
{"text":"There isn't a day that goes by that I think of what we could have done with that $400 we spent.  Went for my birthday, got the 11 course tasting.  Were so amped up for it, and then..........   course after course we were disappointed.  It wasn't as if it tasted bad (although one course did) it was that 3 pieces of sashimi prepared with a different ponzu sauce for about 5 out of 11 courses is not gonna get the job done if you expect it to be worth it.  We honest to god didn't see what the big deal is.  Believe me, we LOVE sushi!!!  If Little Tokyo in Mt Lebo would just spice up their menu a bit with some different applications, they would be the best place to go.  For the price we paid, we were let down hard.  OH! plus I love kids, but on a Saturday night there were kids everywhere! I counted 12 little kids running around the place.  I am sorry, but it just didn't fit the atmosphere.  I have gotten chefs tastings all around this city, New York, France, Italy...  None were ever this expensive.  Most, had wine included with each, and left me excited, full and not upset that I just spent a fortune on it.  I do not think I will return here again."}
{"text":"Painfully mediocre: small rolls, $7.00 miso soup, drinks were reasonable. Rolls small lacking substance. Boring and expensive.  Nice atmosphere but out of luck if handicapped...upper floor no access"}
{"text":"I simply love Umi and have for many years. I live away from Pittsburgh now, but when I'm in town, it tops the list. Oiishi!"}
{"text":"Great sushi for serious sushi eaters.  The omakase is expensive but definitely the way to go. Quite the adventure.  The sauces the chef puts on the sushi/sashimi is what makes the difference.  The black cod dish is unbelievable."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to experience \"the best\" sushi/sashimi in Pittsburgh so we heard rave reviews of UMI.. We went last week for our anniversary..  1. When we arrived 15 minutes early..we were sat right away..in the back.. which was great but noone came to offer us drinks or ANYTHING for 1/2 hour.  2. After 2 other tables around us were sat and served their drinks, a server ( i thought she was the bartender the way she was acting) came over, didn't even introduce herself...seemed annoyed first off.. She asked what we wanted to drink and left.  3. (Now, we did ask for the main waiter Larry, which was a friend of a friend, but he didn't stop over until 2 and a half hours later- if we had him the whole time i think the experience would have been a LOT better)  4. Most of the sushi we received had tons of sauce drowning the fish. If it's the BEST sushi selection in Pitt, why drown them with sauces and put raw garlic on them! I was prepared for the small slivers/small rolls as I read comments about the food on tripadvisor beforehand but you couldn't even taste the fish! 5. Every time we ordered something it took at least 20-25 minutes to get. We were in there FOREVER! They were quick with the drinks though... At one point we looked around and NOONE had food in front of them ( there were about 40 people in the place)  6. You can't HEAR the person talking to you b/c it's SO LOUD... I mean REALLY loud. You'd think since you are paying $$$ the ambiance would be a little better.  My husband has worked in the food industry in the past and we eat out frequently - We love trying the new innovative restaurants around town, and we have never had such a bad experience. On top of that it was our anniversary. I have never placed a bad review of a restaurant until now.  I will not recommend this establishment in the future. It's so unfortunate though..I really thought they were going to be awesome."}
{"text":"Melt in your mouth sushi. Highest quality in Pittsburgh. Only complaint is that the prices are pretty absurd. Usually sushi/nigiri comes in a pair of 2 this was 5 per single piece. Rolls only have 6 pieces per the price tag. Worth trying for a fancy dinner out."}
{"text":"Mr. Shu has taken the Nobu method and made it better. This restaurant is amazing big only because of the new style sushi but also the consistency of quality. I highly recommend the omakase."}
{"text":"I had some pretty high expectations for Umi, since it claimed to be the best sushi in Pittsburgh.  Those expectations kind of fell flat.  Service here on a Saturday night was atrocious.  We waited about 10 minutes before we were asked what we would like to drink and then another 20 min before we were asked what we would like to order.  Not OK.  On top of that, our interactions with our waiter were just awkward.  Something seemed to be up, like there was some tension going on with him and maybe the staff/kitchen?    As far as the sushi goes... it's pretty good.  I got some maki rolls, which were very good, but nothing spectacular.  Miso soup... OK.  Salad was OK.    The sashimi definitely seemed like a better option and something they took greater pride in.  The people next to us who had ordered some sashimi options and seemed quite satisfied.  If I come back again, I'll make sure to order sashimi.  However, I was so annoyed by the lack of service that I doubt I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"So, this was my third trip to Umi in as many years and this time we splurged on the 11-course Omakase. The big daddy. We were, to say the least, excited to experience Mr. Shu's wild ride.  Meh. Of the 11 courses, 7 were three teeny shreds of sashimi dabbed with sweet soy and then topped with a micro-garnish. Was the fish excellent? Yes. Did it taste good? Yes. The miso cod was as yummy as ever and who doesn't love bang-bang bang shrimp, but there was literally nothing on the entire menu that made me say WOW! Also, the service was achingly, mind-numbingly slow (not the server's fault, he couldn't bring out food until it was ready). It took us over three hours (and too much sake which we mostly were drinking out of boredom and hunger) to work our way through what could not have amounted to 10 ounces of food, total. Somewhere around course 8 we realized we were still really, really hungry and that there was no hope of that changing (particularly when the dessert course consisted of three tiny bites of candy).  We left there $450 poorer (if I had realized the sake our server recommended was $50 for each tiny bottle I'd have not ordered more) and stopped on the way home for cheeseburgers.  The atmosphere was, as always, lovely (the tables in the back are the way to go) and our server was fantastic, we actually had a fun evening, but I don't think I can ever justify a return trip for the cost - it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"We kept being told that Umi is hands down the best sushi in Pittsburgh, so the expectation was already there.  People get really territorial about sushi and what is qualified as \"the best\" in each of our heads.  As for Umi, they get high marks in my opinion for for quality of sushi, quality of toro specifically, taste of rock shrimp entree and sea bass with miso.  Our server Benjamin was friendly, delightful and professional as well.    It was good and I am glad we went to experience Umi, but life is about managing expectations and despite my 3 stars, I too am not sure if I would go back.  I want to give it 4 stars on food alone, but the negative points which made me more inclined to give it 3 stars were:  1) only being able to get a reservation past 9pm any day of the week for many weeks in advance on Open Table (built up my expectation of what I thought Umi would be)  2) being turned away from Valet at our 9pm arrival because it was full (again, built up my expectation of how in demand Umi is)  3) the long flights of stairs to reach the restaurant is a haul if you don't like or cannot walk stairs with ease.  Although we are fit and able, we were advised that there is not an elevator to get patrons to the restaurant, but a person could be served Umi menu from Soba restaurant on first floor.  Not sure where the ADA compliance is here, but even if they are up to code, seems bizarre in the 21st century to hear from someone that it is almost incredibly inconvenient to show up with an issue that would prohibit you from walking up stairs in order to be served at Umi.  But regardless, \"stairway to almost heaven\" again almost feeds into to expectation of \"what is at the top\" and what my experience will be.   4)  venue space is indeed small and thus explains limited reservations.  It is a calming, welcoming, dimly lit designed room...felt cool, hip, modern in a way.  5)  sushi quality was indeed there, but sushi portions are indeed small.  The Rainbow Roll is my barometer on sushi and thus my bar on comparing one sushi establishment to another.  Portions do not need to be large to be considered great when it comes to sushi, but for $27 for a Rainbow Roll, the expectation is there that this is going to be so amazing it is going to rock my world.   Quality was very good, roll was very fresh, but not $27 good.  The slices of fish on top of roll were too thin to be warrant the price.  I am happy to pay $27, but the restaurant set my expectation up and I was a little disappointed.  If the Rainbow Roll was $20, I might feel differently.    Life is about managing expectations, so go to Umi and try it for yourself and you be the judge and write your own review."}
{"text":"I met a friend for dinner here on Friday night.  It is a very cool atmosphere and has the perk of complimentary valet in Shadyside.  The food was excellent.  The waiter recommended the seafood tempura, which met expectations.  I recommend reservations, as the dining area is small.  It's also pricey, so make it a special occassion."}
{"text":"Be sure to try the el jefe! ;)  * transparency: i visited Umi twice, while visiting Pittsburgh every week for a matter of months during the fall of 2012. Umi was one of our team's favorite venues."}
{"text":"Great service! Great food!  Great atmosphere.  Have tasted many baked cod miso at many high end Japanese sushi restaurants and none beat Mr. Shu's.  Best sushi in Pittsburgh... period!  Omakase blows away trendy places like \"blue ribbon sushi\" in New York and Vegas. All fish is packed with flavor ( not lifeLess piles of negri).  Tastes are similar to the new style sushi at nobu.  Yes the price is high but the consistency is there time and time again!  Refreshed my review because I noticed some \"over the top\" nasty reviews on Yelp! Seriously, if you are giving Umi less than 3 stars.... do everyone a favor and go bury your \"reviews\" and worthless opinions in a hole somewhere.  Delete your Yelp account. Your opinion doesn't matter."}
{"text":"Four stars because it is undeniable that it is tasty even with being pricey (and small!).  The miso cod was excellent grade fish and a must-try.  Interesting spin on sushi with some unique variations.  Some smack:   1.  not many choices for sushi in Pittsburgh, but this does not mean they should mark up sushi beyond even Chicago prices!    2.   the host waited on us and when put on the spot about what was in a roll he was completely clueless...  3.   (the greatest sin of all) my table was STICKY"}
{"text":"My wife & I had wanted to visit Umi for some time.  Everything we had read & heard indicated that it would be a great experience.  While there was nothing bad about our food, there was nothing special about it either, certainly nothing that would cause me to spend that much money there again.  It was good but not great and definitely not worth what they charge."}
{"text":"This is a copy of my review for the event that this fine establishment hosted. I was not aware that the review would not show up on their restaurant page. I am kinda new at this! But yeah... Here it is..            Overall experience with the drinks was really good. The tai mule gave me a little tickle in the back of my tongue, with a taste of lemon and mint. The sangria was served with a orange(of course) and was blended perfectly with fruity and wine. The desert drink was different for me as I don't usually drink something with such a kick. So with that said, I am not sure if it was brandy or whiskey. Overall the drinks were fab.     The seared bar tuna was served with peanut and Korean bbq sauce. It was very tasteful and not dry at all. My head needed a minute to wrap itself around how good it was.     The double salmon roll was very good. The salmon was definitely fresh and put together very nicely. The other roll was  cucumber and avocado. I enjoyed this one because you were able to taste everything, including the seaweed wrap, which has been a while for me, so I know it was fresh.     The Korean fried chicken on a boa bun(rice flour), with a tomato, cilantro, and sweet pickle was delish! I really with I could have had another one!.. And will!     The rock shrimp was very good as well, with a nice spice to it. It wasn't dry and was very flavorful. This was also served very cute in a paper cone.     The sea bass kabob was cooked with perfection! The meat was juicy and flavorful with a sweet tasting glaze, and was not overwhelming with a seafood taste.     The shishito pepper were mild and either grilled or chard. Not sure if it had a taste of cayenne, but over all they were good. The edamame was good as well.     Being that this was an special event, I can not really being critical of the actual service we received, I will have to do that when I come back for a regular visit, but it was very good.  The ambiance was very nice and romantic, casual, and comfortable. That's all I can say!"}
{"text":"I wanted to visit Umi at least twice before I felt like I could write a review.  Not to sound like a snob (just trying to emphasize a point here), but I am originally from Southern California and can honestly say I have tried some of the best sushi and sashimi around.  After visiting Umi twice now, I can, for a fact, say that I have had the best fish here.  I cannot emphasize how flavorful and fresh the sushi and sashimi is!    Of course, the freshness of the food doesn't come cheap.  I have been here twice with my boyfriend and our bill, excluding drinks, has always exceeded $100.  Servings are on the smaller side so you have to get a couple of entrees.    Anyway, the last time we went to Umi was on Valentine's Day.  I have a feeling that making reservations is always the way to go for this place, especially on special occasions and holidays.  During our visit, we got the oyster sashimi, miso soup, mixed seaweed salad, squid \"pasta\" with garlic sauce, the assorted sashimi entree and two different kinds of makis.  In addition, we also shared a dessert brought up from the Soba Lounge downstairs (Umi shares a delicious dessert menu with Soba).  There were only three oysters that came with one $15 order... I was a bit disappointed until I actually ate one.  It was the freshest oyster I have ever had and I am not exaggerating.  Also, another pleasant surprise for me was despite the fact that the assorted sashimi entree was only supposed to come with one serving of miso soup and salad, our server (during both visits) served the both of us with the soup and salad without having to be asked.  I thought that was pretty neat.  The miso soup tasted like it was made from scratch.  I could taste the flavor of the miso and the soup was not too salty or watery.  The texture of the seaweed salad was what I expected it to be.  I mean, you can't really go wrong with a seaweed salad, right?  The squid \"pasta\" was just like how the name made it sound - squid that was thinly sliced like pasta, served with a sort of buttery, garlic, ponzu sauce.  They served this with white rice on the side. The sashimi entree had five different types of sashimi: red snapper, yellowtail, mackarel, tuna, and salmon.  Goodness, I could go on and on about how absolutely delicious the sashimi was but I will not waste your time and just tell you to try it for yourself.  That is, if you are a fan of raw fish.  The makis we got were in small portions but were also delicious.  If I could go back and eat at Umi every weekend, I would.  Alas, the prices do not fit my meager monthly budget.  However, Umi will always make the top of my list when dining out for special occasions."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend to get the Omakase dinner at Umi as a Christmas present - it seems like the best location to go for a special occasion, something really memorable.  We made a reservation for a Saturday evening, and got a little dressed up - with the dim lighting and sleek decor, it's fun to wear something here besides regular ol' jeans.  The host was very friendly, taking our coats when we arrived, and our server was equally gracious.  Umi is a place with truly skilled service, one of the few places I've eaten in town with utterly professional staff.  They are knowledgeable and skillful, and they added tremendously to our dining experience.  The Omakase dinner is pricey, I think around $85 per person for seven courses and dessert, which is what we got.  The eleven-course meal, at around $130, just seemed like too much for our first try at this.  Alas, time has passed since our meal and I failed to write the courses down anyway, but here's the general scoop: Most of the seven courses were prepared raw.  I'd say five out of seven.  There were 3-4 sashimi courses - just raw, unspeakably fresh fish dressed delicately in various sauces and flavorings.  One course was gently fried tempura rock shrimp, another was cooked - I want to say black cod, but the rest were sashimi or sushi, appearing incredibly simple but tasting complex.  We took our server's recommendation for sake - it was pricey, but floral and delicious.    My boyfriend raved about the meal as each course came and went - we both had a wonderful experience.  I will give it five stars, but I hesitate only because it was such a pricey experience.  I have no doubt that the fish was impeccably fresh and certainly worth paying for, but the bill for two of us was well over $200 including the sake.  And the food, while excellent, was extremely light and delicate.  Now I'm not a big fan of being stuffed to capacity, but with an $85 meal, I hoped to have a little bit more food.  I was also hoping to have a little more variety - perhaps this was my ignorance, but I was surprised that 4 of the courses were sashimi - just four thin, amazing pieces of fish on a plate.  They were all wonderful - but it was a lot of sashimi.  I was hoping for something more substantial, more bold, perhaps?  But that doesn't change the fact that every bite of food we did have was of impeccable quality.  I'd recommend omakase only to those who are celebrating a special occasion, love raw fish, and are willing to pay over $100 per person for food and drink.  I think in the future, I'd come back and just order a variety of sashimi and maki.  And Umi was a class act, from start to finish, with outstanding service and chefs who are clearly passionate about their product."}
{"text":"According to the Pittsburgh Magazine, this is supposedly one of the best 25 restaurants in Pittsburgh. Clearly they have never been out of their city, county or state. I suggest they take a trip to Philly and try some of the good Japanese food. Regardless, the snapper/fluke/yellowtail yuzu jalape√±o is a nice touch, but not a must try. Service is sketchy here at best."}
{"text":"Fabulous 11-course Omakase.  I've had many across the USA, you must visit this hidden gem.  Pittsburgh knows its food, watch out NYC!"}
{"text":"The taste is unbeatable, but the prices are so expensive that after spending $150 you'll still be hungry!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Pittsburgh (but I wouldn't compare it to the best places in CA). Good service, ambiance. Pricey for Pittsburgh though."}
{"text":"Easily the best sushi in the city. It's apparent in the quality and freshness. We created our own tasting with the help of our extremely knowledgeable server and expectations were easily surpassed. The Kobe beef is a necessity as is the Sawara. They both just melted in your mouth with the best flavors! The prices are significantly higher than a normal sushi restaurant, but this is not a normal sushi restaurant. The fish is flown in from across the world and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Too expensive for what you get. $23 for an 8 piece dragon roll? that's insane.  $50 minimum to sit at the sushi bar, that's lame. They say it's cuz the chef wants you to watch him make your specialty expensive rolls. What if I want to sit there and drink $50 worth of miso soup, would they bounce me? The ambience is nice. Great paintings on the walls. Who knows, maybe there is not a lot of sushi in Pittsburgh and that's how they get away with the price? Ca Roll, dragon roll, and green something roll with tuna, all average/good sushi, just too overpriced."}
{"text":"We decided to kick off our anniversary weekend with Omakase at Umi. We opted for the 7-course (+ dessert), although we did get a surprise amuse about halfway through. The fish was absolutely amazing and very fresh, particularly the black cod (cooked) and the sashimi sampler at the end (each fish paired with a tiny bit of sauce or other flavor). However, the courses came out REALLY close together. Like, I had barely put my hashi down when the next course came. For me, eight courses should be something to enjoy, especially when you're dropping this kind of money. Finally, the fiance and I just started eating the individual courses more slowly, but we still ended up out of there in less than 90 minutes. Dessert was okay but I do wish there had been some choices (I realize the point of Omakase is chef's choice, but I wouldn't extend that to non-house-made desserts); it was a chocolate cake with chocolate mousse and I am not a chocolate girl. Given what I've heard about Soba's dessert menu I was hoping to get to try something else!  We ordered a couple of cocktails as we sat down and they didn't come out until we were done with our first course--Mr. Shu actually checked on them for us upon realizing we only had water. They do serve their Moscow Mules in copper cups, if you care about that kind of thing. Overall, the fish is SUPERB, but the experience was somewhat disappointing due to being so rushed."}
{"text":"Well food is good but not impressive. I gave it three stars because everything is overpriced. I would rather go to little Tokyo at the south side for better price and taste"}
{"text":"Located somewhat obscurely on the third floor of Soba, Umi's sister restaurant, this is the finest upscale place in Pittsburgh for sushi. All of parent company Big Burrito's restaurants have a high standard, but at Umi one quickly forgets that it's part of a larger entity, as it's so chef-driven. It's my understanding that Umi is only open when Mr. Shu is there, which explains why it's only open five days a week and closes for a summer vacation. The Omakase option is simply awesome. There's an 11-course and seven-course option. I've only had the 11 and it's excellent. Some of the courses look similar to one another with two or three pieces of fish, but the tastes and preparations definitely differ. My only complaint about it is that I wish it would change more from time to time. As it is, many courses are the same each time (even many months apart), including the chef's spoons (lobster and kobe beef), rock shrimp tempura and miso cod, with some of the other course with pieces of fish varying. I've been told that the seven-course options is only the same, but that the 11 varies, presumably in those additional four courses. More frequent and drastic changes would certainly keep me coming back. The service is always totally on-point, regardless of servers, though Larry, who has worked there a long time tends to be popular. There's a great sake list as well. Make sure your wallet is full. Good things like this don't come cheap!"}
{"text":"One of the best omakase I've ever had.  ($130 per person for 11 course, and you can go on and add on more courses if you want) worth every penny! Better than NYC or LA, what a gem! Came here a second time for my anniversary dinner! It would be a waste to order normal sushi rolls here (which I saw quite often) and NOT sit at the bar to enjoy Mr. Shu's amazing, AMaZING creations live. Mr. Shu was a chef at NOBU NYC years ago and has definitely surpassed them in terms of quality and taste of his creations. This place is only worth it if you are a serious sushi connoisseur and if you are going to order their omakase."}
{"text":"I cannot recommend this restaurant. I've spent a good amount of time in Japan so when I go to whats supposed to be the best Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh I have to compare experiences. I did the $130 11 course Omakase. Each course was good. Nothing about the food was bad at all. The prices are far out of line for the portions. I've had better in this city."}
{"text":"When my wife and I moved to PGH from Boston, we were worried about finding good sushi in town. More than one person told us that the Original Fish Market was the best in town, and after trying it, we despaired a little. However, after passing Umi a couple times in a our neighborhood travels, we foolishly walked in on a Saturday night to try it. Foolishly because the palce is tiny and walking in without reservations is a apparently a suicide mission. However, we lucked out in two ways. First, they were able to accomodate us at the sushi bar, and second, the sushi chef was exceptionally cool. Not only was his handiwork phenonemenal, but he was cordial, answering our questions and appreciative of our compliments.  On to the grub: the toro sashimi was melt-in-your-mouth good. In fact, one of the cool little tricks of the chef is that adds a litte topping to each piece, which was unique and added a cool twist without overpowering the fish. The quality of all of the fish was exceptional, the key to any sushi adventure. Great experience, great food, cool chef, what more could you ask for? Just be sure to make a reservation!"}
{"text":"I ate one of the top 2 meals of my life in this restaurant.  It was the first time i had heard of \"omkase\" (or chef's choice of many small courses), and despite the hefty pricetag, I was celebrating and opted to try it.  oh. my. god.   an absolute slamdunk.  I can't imagine going here and not getting that unbelivable sampler.  my mouth is watering as i type."}
{"text":"My wife and I had an amazing date night at Umi. We happened to walk in on a weekday and get a table at one of the cool authentic low tables (however you don't have to cross your legs and sit because a hole is cut out for you to sit normally). Our waiter was great and attentive. He recommended multiple dishes and none disappointed. The rock shrimp tempura was great as were the noodles. The vibe was phenomenal. We are going to go back for their special omakase menu. Would def recommend this as a go to place for seafood loving people."}
{"text":"Very fresh sushi and great atmosphere. The chef gave us complimentary appetizers and desserts, but we gladly gave the house more business by ordering tasty sushi and drinks."}
{"text":"My omakase 11 course chef tasting was one of my most rememberable dining experiences in Pittsburgh. As he prepared our beginning courses, the chef and I spoke Chinese together talking of our time in Taiwan. As we entered our later courses, a couple from Taiwan sat down. We were all speaking Chinese together and had a really unique experience here in America.   The food was absolutely amazing! I kept myself hydrated between courses with the lychee fiz, followed by glasses of prosecco. Each of the 11 courses was better than the previous one. If you are hesitating between the omakase tasting or the regular menu, I would definitely suggest for the 11 course option. You may still be hungry after 9 courses.    Troy Polamalu was in the dining room as well."}
{"text":"Wow, those are the smallest sushi rolls I've ever seen!  Came here with a party of 4 and got to sit in the cool area where you can sit on the floor (there's a section of the floor cut out so you don't have to sit indian style.  The food was good but I think Chaya has better sushi.  The only roll that stood out was the spider roll.  I also tried some of the teriyaki steak and that I must say was pretty delicious.  If I come back here it would have to be with someone adventurous enough to try one of the tasting meals with me but otherwise I will stick with Chaya in squirrel hill.    If you're looking for a nice date place that serves alcohol then I would recommend it.  Side note: Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Omikase special is the way to go.  I have never liked mackerel.  I was told it would be one of the dishes and that if I didn't like it my meal would be free.  I couldn't even pretend I didn't like it.  Each dish the chef made was amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a better than average- let's say very solid-  sushi restaurant.    We had the omakase and had some delicious bite sized courses.  But strangely the little bites never added up to feeling super full (which could be a good thing, but devouring a chocolate pretzel dessert isn't really the perfect end to omakase).    The miso black cod was excellent, the sashimi was well executed, and clearly the chef had many, many years of traditional sushi training.  But for some reason my socks just weren't blown off.  More sushi and sashimi could have done the trick.  On the other hand the desserts were delicious and memorable (which come from the restaurant downstairs- Soba).  Great atmosphere, attentive service and will def. go back.  At the same time, I'm open to finding alternatives in Pittsburgh (too optimistic?)  And Dr. Freddie Fu is a fan (see autographed picture on sushi bar).  Not sure what this means, but maybe if I return I will be further enlightened."}
{"text":"Got the 11 course omakase, prob the worst omakase experience I've ever had. This place def isn't authentic and caters to the clientele of the area. Almost every dish was sweet and nothing was \"fresh.\"  If this is what is considered to be the best in the 412, save your money. Oh and we essentially got the same dish twice except they added raw garlic slice on top of the fish.  This place gets 2 stars bc they had hibiki."}
{"text":"We really, really wanted to like Umi. But it's drastically overpriced for the quality and portions offered. Perhaps we would have had a better experience if we'd chosen the $90 per person tasting menu -- but we just didn't feel hungry enough to merit what we thought might have been too much food. So we ordered some rolls and appetizers instead.  The one thing that struck me as awful for such an expensive, otherwise nice restaurant, is that they are serving pollack instead of crab. Perhaps crab is not in season, so by all means serve an alternative, but POLLACK? Pollack is cheap and lame. It's the hallmark of cheap sushi joints -- so  I would have been fine with the pollack if the sushi had been 1/3 the price (it's called \"kani\" on the menu -- I felt stupid when I realized that, I never would have ordered it).  It seems to me that Umi is taking advantage of the fact there isn't much sushi competition in Pittsburgh and serving meh sushi with pollack to a population that may not be the wiser, and charging an arm and a leg. Our meal was more than $100 and it was just a few rolls, an appetizer and drinks."}
{"text":"This is the real deal...in Pittsburgh. Don't expect flop down for a casual California roll here. They take the sushi and the experience very seriously. The downside is that it you'll never be satisfied with average sushi again.  Pro tip: make reservations days in advance."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet because it was simply incredible!  Seriously folks, if you're looking for a nice night on the tahn, look no further!  And my words of advice: DO THE OMAKASE TASTING MENU!  There's really nothing more to tell you other than you will find it incredible, I guarantee!    The Omakase tasting menu is either a seven course or eleven course dinner with dessert.  It's indulgent and worth every penny (at $85 and $130 respectively).  The plates served to you are small, but honestly not as small as I thought they'd be and the desserts, seriously, massive!    We had the salmon tartare, sawara seared with hot sesame oil, fluke sashimi, black cod with miso, tuna shashimi rock shrimp tempura and an array of sashimi (toro, snapper, salmon, tuna and saward).  Honestly everything was fantastic and fresh, just like fish should be.     Like I said, the desserts were all amazing and most of the choices were very rich.  I really enjoyed the chocolate maki and the inventive house made ice creams.    The overall experience blew me away.  From the service, to the food to the atmosphere it's a perfect 5 star place and if you live here and haven't been, don't wait any longer!"}
{"text":"Being a big sushi fan, I can't believe I went almost four years in Pittsburgh (with 2 in Shadyside) without going to Umi. The food was very good, but it was really the service, venue/seating, and ambiance that helped make the experience. We had a reservation but choose to wait a few extra minutes for the tatami seating, so we enjoyed a quick drink downstairs while we waited. Having never sat at a table like this before, it was quite a fun experience.  We started with the stuffed shiitake and the edamame, but which were delicious. Next we had the sawara seared with hot sesame oil and the red snapper with truffle oil. The sawara was the one fish that I was not excited by - I thought it was pretty bland and the sesame oil didn't do much to help. The red snapper, however, made up for it. It was the freshest snapper I've had since moving to the 'burgh and it was complimented perfectly by the truffle oil. I could have eaten just this for dinner and been satisfied. We also tried one of the assorted sushi plates which came with salmon, fluke, tuna, and a few others - they were all great. I know we ordered a few other dishes as well but they are slipping mind at the moment. To finish the night we had the sesame ice cream, which I have never had before. Our waitress described it as \"peanut-buttery\" which I didn't understand until I tried it, and that is the best description I can think of now. It was quite tasty. The wines and sake are also good! Come thirsty!"}
{"text":"Do not go here if you are on a budget and/or really hungry.  However, if you have an expense account or are a guest of someone with an expense account (as I was last night) than this is a good option.  In fact, this is the best sushi I've had in Pittsburgh.  Umi is a part of the admirable big  burrito group.  It's located above Soba.  It's up two long sets of stairs, so if you are bringing someone handicapable or elderly they'll have trouble navigating the double staircases.  As I was walking up the stairs last night I noticed the painted large waves on the walls.  I believe Umi is japanese for big wave (maybe?).  Our reservation was for 6:30 and initially they only had the tatami tables where you sit on the ground and your feet dangle in a hole in the floor.  These tables are probably okay for date night, but would have been weird with two business associates.  Luckily, a table opened up.  If it's this busy on a Tuesday I suggest a reservations.  Anyways, the rest of the space is very nice with a sushi bar with about 5 seats as soon as you enter and very warm colors with a few scuptures and a waterfall in the middle of the dining room.  The service was pretty good.  There was nothing particularly memorable.  I started with a Mark West Chardonnay, which was okay and priced under $10.  They also have a good selection of warm and cold sake'.  I started with the white tuna sashimi which was a few slices of super fresh melt in your mouth tuna with a nice soy sauce and just the right amount of wasabi.  Matt tried the shrimp tempura which was perfectly breaded quickly fried light shrimp with veggies.  This was a good deal at $12.  Keith had the lobster soup which had a few big chunks of lobster and a nice broth.  I ordered the toro tartar with caviar, which was probably a teaspoon of super creamy fatty tuna and a touch of caviar.  This was really rich and one of the most expensive teaspoon serving I've ever had at $21 for such a small amount.  Keith had some noodle dish which he said was good and actually was pretty reasonable, but again it's noodles.  Matt ordered the strip steak tataki, which was about 1 1/2 ounces of prime steak served with a sweet soy sauce.  It was delicious, but again $20 for less than a 2 oz. serving.  I stuck with sashimi.  The lobster sashimi was great and had some type of flavored sauce instead of just soy.  The salmon and tuna were also amazing.  They were cut perfectly and tasted like they were just pulled from the sea.  Overall a really good sashimi \"dinner\", however I have to admit I did stop for pizza a few hours later."}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate dinner at Umi last night and we both had the 7 course omakase. It was outstanding. It comprised 7 of the chef's specialities (5 sashimi or nigiri, plus 2 courses that were cooked) plus dessert. Platings were simple and courses came at good intervals- neither rushed nor too far apart.  The whole experience took about 90 minutes. The yellowtail sashimi and rock shrimp courses (the cooked ones coincidentally) were our favorites, but it was really hard to choose any one over the others. The flavors were astonishing in some cases - rich and buttery, or citrusy and fresh, or sweet and spicy combinations. The worst I could say is some were just \"very good.\" All in all - extremely fresh as you would expect, and superb. Unlike other reviewers who complained of small portions for the cost, we were more than satisfied.  I would never equate quality with the size of the portions. Neither of us has what I'd describe are small appetites - we like food. While the portions looked small, they were extremely flavorful, rich and satisfying.  Dessert was a trio of one-bite items, including a cookie with 5 spices and a truffle. Very yummy and a nice treat after all that protein. The coffee was strong and excellent. I cannot say enough good things about the service (which in Pittsburgh is a unique experience.) Umi is certainly expensive, but the quality is worth it."}
