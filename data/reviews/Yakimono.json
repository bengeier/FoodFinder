{"text":"So ive been there for dinner many times and honeslty I didny like it as much as the lunch special! But then they changed their price snd they are very expensive for sushi only because its kosher. So i mean if my family decides to go ill tag along but if its by choice.. id go to maiko!!"}
{"text":"sushi is extremely fresh and tasty. restaurant is a little bit small. great sitting on patio roughly during the summer. service is pretty good. Costs me roughly 50$ per person every time I go there."}
{"text":"Delicious and accommodating.  They will bake any raw sushi for those who have not developed a taste for raw sushi.  Staff is friendly enough.  Depending on how busy, food can be slower than other places, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Good sushi. Usually fresh. The waitresses are extremely sweet and helpful. I'm a regular and I never had a bad experience with them."}
{"text":"the food is great, but be prepared to pay up... the service is friendly but food comes out slow. this place is often full, so do reserve ahead of time"}
{"text":"I now live in Toronto, but I still dream of their Kani salad. The sushi is absolutely incredible and their sauces are to die for :) I try to visit when I'm visiting my family in Montreal."}
{"text":"This place is always consistent, fresh and enjoyable, the service was excellent, try to get Ben as your busboy.  I highly recommend the sushi bar at for a party of four."}
