{"text":"When we walked into the restaurant, there was only 1 free table in the restaurant. The table immediately next to it, had customers with their bare naked feet propped up onto the table and chairs! The waiters and staff didn't even say anything about it, and in fact, made us look like the weird ones for thinking  that it's both disgusting and unhygienic. Needless to say, we immediately headed for the door, and we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"First time at Wong's and I was not disappointed! The exterior scared me a little with some guy outside selling me a video camera but it didn't stop me from checking out this place. Upon entering, I was welcomed with a nice smile from the waitress.   We got the following:  1. Chicken pakora - 7/10 (spicier the better)  2. Chilli paneer - 5.5/10 (should get it with gravy) 3. Manchuria Beef fried rice - 7.5   Overall experience = 7/10   The chefs children were around doing their homework so you can tell it's a family run business. I love Hakka food and I told her if she can make my chicken pakora \"less\" spicy. Low and behold, she did! It was the perfect spice for me. People know I love my vinegar so when I asked her for \"regular vinegar\" she didn't even hesitate and gave me one. That's good service right there!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Hakka restaurants I've been to. The portions are huge and their prices are really cheap. For a little over $20, we got 10 huge fried wontons, chili chicken, white rice and the manchurian beef noodles, and we had a lot of leftovers to take home. The owner and staff are also really friendly and go out of their way to ensure that you have a good experience."}
{"text":"Man o man this place is a winner across the board. The owners are absolutely fantastic and so is their cooking.   I had the chili beef (gravy) and my date had the chili paneer as she is a vegetarian. Each dish cost under $10 and the portions were very large and delicious. Added a couple of veggie spring rolls and the wonton chicken soup (also huge, cheap, and delicious). I honestly liked it so much I ordered a plate of curry beef to go (it also is amazing). Just really flavourful without the typical greasy feel. What a winner.  The owners were super friendly and engaging and we will definitely be back here as this is the best Hakka I've personally had in Toronto so far."}
{"text":"first time at Wong's Asian Cuisine, it is Hakka-Chinese cuisine.  Good prices for lunch specials.  We ordered Shrimp and Lobster sauce + rice w/soup lunch special and Chicken with Black Bean sauce + rice w/pop.  Condiments were simple, was hoping for chinese vinegar, but not available.  Wife had hot and sour soup with her lunch combo (only 1 type of soup offered), it was too spicy for her and for me as well, we ended up not finishing the soup. Shrimp and Lobster sauce was a bit more salty than we normally like.  We just barely finished our respective lunch dishes, was almost too much for us.  At the time of our visit only 1 staff member was managing the dining room, service was kinda average.  There are more dishes we are curious on tasting so likely will return again.  They do accept cash/debit, not certain on Credit cards."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Very reasonable priced and hearty portions. Ordered sweet corn soup, chicken pakoda, chilly chicken, chilly garlic chicken and chicken fried rice, everything thing was prepared very well. The icing on the entire experience was the warm and attentive service. Will definitely be my go Hakka place in the future. Recommend 100%."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend who frequents this place and we were pleasantly surprised. It's hidden in a small strip mall sandwiched beside a few other restaurants and is really clean. The owners were really friendly and helped us pick out our dinner. Chicken pakoras with coriander sauce were so tasty! They also gave us masala flavoured fries- which isn't on the menu and you'd think would be weird to order but they were perfect and crunchy and delish! We ordered dry chili shrimp (perfect spice!), ginger chicken, beef and broccoli and green beans. All came with a bowl of rice as well. Really big portions and for three of us we could barely finish and took food home.  Our meal came to under $60! We will be back because I'm curious to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"I took my dad here for his birthday last night and I will definitely be coming back. The food was great and the service was amazing!"}
{"text":"Had the shrimp pakora's, chilli garlic beef and the eggplant. This is by far the best hakka food I've had. Everything was amazing but I especially liked the shrimp pakoras. It was like eating tandoori flavoured popcorn shrimp."}
{"text":"Came back here today for lunch. We ordered ginger beef, beef fried rice and wonton soup.  Big portion, good taste and friendly service. The server catered to our request to put Chinese broccoli instead of green onion in the ginger beef dish.  Only wish they turned up the heat as the restaurant felt like an ice box today. Other than that, no complaints. Still a good place to get Hakka food."}
{"text":"I went there the other day and order their lunch special (11:30am-2:30pm).  I had the Mixed Vegetables Chicken.  It was so good that I went back the day after for dinner and order Beef Cantonese Fried Noodles.  Both were very flavourable, tasty and delicious.  I strongly recommend this restaurant.   Friendly staff and accommodating to your taste.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Bro and I had vegetables fried rice, manchurian mix chow mein, chilli chicken with extra gravy and all extra spicy .. food was so good .. gotta comeback soon"}
{"text":"Wong's is hubby and my new go to Hakka place!  Went to Spicy Dragon for lunch but they were packed, so turned to trusty Yelp for some help. Looking for some affordable lunch specials and Wong's came up with a $. Yes it's in a small divey strip mall but the minute you walk in the door you'll be glad you braved the panhandlers (there was only one actually but it didn't sound as good without the \"s\").   Nice clean restaurant with lots of available tables, a strong aircon and free WiFi. I was enamored by their delicate cork art (see pics); the detail was so beautiful. The bubbly hostess was also our server. She was the sweetest thing: always smiling and helpful. With her detailed descriptions we decided on....   - Hot & sour soup with shrimp - should have gotten chicken because the shrimp were tiny and I didn't like the taste of them; however, the soup was spicy and flavourful and left a strong afterburn. - Lung Fung soup - if you like egg drop soup, you'll like this. Chock-full of veggies, tofu and chicken. - Chicken Pakora - crispy and flavorful on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside. - Chili Fish (dry) lunch special which comes with a tiny egg roll (bleh), rice and soup/pop. It was flavorful and the fish was moist.  Didn't see any dessert on the menu so I asked the waitress about it; she must have notice my sad face and went to talk to the chef (who happens to be her hubby). She came back and said that the chef could make us a deep fried pineapple dessert with vanilla ice cream drizzled with maple syrup OH YEAH! Tried the ice cream and I didn't like the taste of it;  but when we paired it with the warm deep fried pineapple and the maple drizzle, it was delish!  With lunch menu prices at $5.95, nice ambiance (inside), and exemplary service; Wong's blew Spicy Dragon out of the water! It was nice knowing you SD."}
{"text":"My favourite place for super spicy Hakka food. Dishes aren't normally made to be very spicy, but they will make it exactly how you want it. The owners and staff here do a great job. They're all very kind and make sure they feed you like you're family."}
{"text":"It is extremely difficult not to give Wong's Asian Cuisine 4 stars, and here are the reasons?:  1) Portion - gigantic is the right description.  We ordered a Manchurian Beef Noodle ($8) for take out.  It filled 2 boxes.  My BF and I could only finish 1 of the 2 boxes together.  2) Price - Very affordable.  $8 for a Manchurian Beef/Chicken Noodle.  $9 for a Chicken Pakora.  There were about 15 pieces of pakora (see picture).  Each piece was the size of a golf ball.  Lunch special is $6 per item, available Monday to Friday.  3) Services - The waitress was fast, effective and friendly.  She gave us extra napkins per request.  Like 4 extra thick napkins.  It was pretty generous.    4) Cleanliness - the exterior of the store looked divey.  The interior looked nothing special.  The washroom (ladies) was, surprise surprise, very clean and tidy.  Yes, the bathroom amenities were no frills and basic, but it was CLEAN as in no dust, no spot or mark, no mess on floor.  I won't say completely dust free, but it beat the cleanliness level of many expensive restaurants.  And there was hot water, hand soap, paper towels.  I was impressed.  Someone cared about washroom here.  5) Food - I am no authority of Indian Chinese food.  Did the food taste the way it was supposed to taste like?  No clue.  I could tell you everything tasted bold. There were strong spices flavours.  The pakoras were delicious.  The noodle was average: mostly noodle, little beef, orange in colour.  The noodle was noted as non-spicy on menu.  It was actually mildly spicy.  Food was made to order.  It came out of kitchen piping hot.    The food rating is 3 stars in truth.  I round it up to 4 stars, because the first 4 aspects are not just good, but extremely strong."}
{"text":"Tried their lunch special  Kung Pao Chicken with steamed rice and hot & sour soup.   Nothing amazing to be honest - the soup was missing egg and had an off taste and egg roll had definitely been sitting out so it was pretty stale.   However the Kung Pao Chicken was good.   They have a great selection of lunch special"}
{"text":"Extremely reasonable price-point.  Nice owners/staff.  Welcoming staff (and chef) who interact with their customers.  Friendly vibe.  The food:  Bombay Chicken - very tasty, but could have been spicier.   Having said that, the flavours were beautiful.  4/5 Manchurian Vegetable Spicy Soup - LOVELY.  Light, fresh, lots of coriander and a good punch of flavour.  5/5 Hakka mixed noodles - nice, decent amount of seafood and chicken, but again, could have been spicier.  3.5/5 Singapore noodles:  spicy and delectable - special Hakka-style Singapore noodles were amazing.  5/5  Overall, this is a good place.  If they just raised the notch a level or two up for us re: spiciness, it would get five stars.  Again, very pleasant dining atmosphere, overall good vibe."}
{"text":"Outstanding value, portion sizes, service and great quality food.  I would have never thought of going to this place, ever.  The plaza is sketch, the location sucks, but wow. The food and service were fantastic.    Well worth a visit if you're ever in the area."}
