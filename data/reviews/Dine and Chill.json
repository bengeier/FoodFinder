{"text":"I ordered a take-out lunch. I was not happy with it, but I do sincerely hope that others have a better experience.  (I removed my previously detailed review so as give the restaurant another chance)."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to go during their soft launch phase. The place was little rough on the edges, but looked to have great potential.  Layout was similar to their  predecessor, with the sushi bar replacing the bar as the biggest change.  Menu selection was limited, but apt; they had many sushi items, as well as other main cooked courses as well. Being on the pricier side, all menu items looked quite extravagant. The food came in good time, and with great presentation. The quality itself was very good. I had egg on the white (white scramble eggs mixed with various seafoods) and my partner had a sushi platter.  The restaurant had a promotion for a free mocktail per person, so I had a watermelon/yogurt drink and my partner had a blueberry mojito. Both were very delicious.  Ultimately, we are both very excited for the official launch of this restaurant. While spring rolls will be sadly missed, Dine and Chill will definitely be giving it a run for it's money."}
{"text":"....lovely place for a nice quick bite... food was very flavourful... one thing I wud recommend is allow for your waitress to substitute things within the menu. All restaurants do."}
{"text":"I was really sad when spring rolls closed down but still excited to try this new place. We went here last night and they were still in their soft opening phase. The menu was different from what is posted on this page, but only slightly.  The ambiance was really nice, very similar to how spring rolls was. And the booth was comfortable too. There were only  two other groups there at the same time as us so service was not an issue at all.  I ordered the watermelon refresh, which was on special at $1.50. It's basically watermelon juice and a probiotic but it tasted really good. They're planning to add vodka to it once they get their license.  For food, we got the spring rolls, miso ramen, and grilled eggplant and chick peas. The spring rolls were delicious and tasted fresh, not frozen how they taste at some other places. The ramen was also delicious and my friend absolutely loved it. The server advised us that they normally add chicken stock to it, but they will remove it for us, which was really nice. The grilled eggplant came with mushrooms on top and a marinade. And on the side were warm chick peas with bell peppers and pickled veggies. The flavours were good and I really enjoyed it.  We would definitely come back here when they fully open to see what else they add to their menu."}
{"text":"What a great upgrade from Spring Rolls (previous restaurant location). Chic and clean atmosphere. Service gets a 10/10 thanks to Jasmine! She was very friendly, respectful, and gave great recommendations, always topping up our waters and checking up on us frequently. Perfect example of great customer service!  Food gets 8/10. I'd like to come back to try more items on the menu. Overall, I recommend this place if you're looking for something new in Mississauga!  We had the Chili Fried Mushrooms - a great veggie alternative for a calamari-like appetizer. Crispy and great to share.  8/10  With few vegetarian options on the dinner and special menu, our server offered the lunch menu which had Vegetarian Ramen with meat alternative. Overall, another great menu item. Large portion which did not lack flavour even without the meat.  8/10  The Katsu Chicken Curry was a popular item and though quite pricey offers a large portion (definitely shareable with 2 people). The sweet peppers tasted a bit off, but I do like that they didn't taste like frozen vegetables and that the curry came on the side for you to add on your own.  8/10  Last but not least was the Matcha Brûlée which was quite good! Cream and matcha flavours complemented each other well. 9/10"}
{"text":"Saw the new restaurant in town and decided to get the Springroll platter . Service was quick and prompt.  The springrolls were crispy on the outside and soft inside.   I will be back  to try the food again  with friends.  There are notices posted outside alerting customers to a soft opening at the moment . I looked at the soft opening menu and there is a good variety of dishes  in the  20-29$ price range .  I found the ambiance quite relaxing and a place I can bring my friends to for a casual dinner or lunch."}
