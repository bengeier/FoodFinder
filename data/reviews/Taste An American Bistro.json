{"text":"I'm almost afraid to write this review, for fear that it will cause my favorite Sunday restaurant to get crowded. Several months ago, I was looking for a restaurant for Sunday brunch that took reservations. I came across Taste, which is located in the Hilton on Frye Road. My friends and I went the next Sunday, and we are hooked. The decor is lovely and comfortable. You can order off the menu, or enjoy the breakfast buffet for 15 dollars. Eggs any style, breakfast meats, cereals, fruits, pastries...nice! The food is consistently delicious. For me, however, the big draw is the service. Every server or manager that I had encountered(I've been there 8 or 10 times) has gone out of their way to make our experience special. One day, they were a bit crowded, and our regular table was taken. The manager apologized. We never feel rushed, often sitting there long past closing time. One of my favorite things: they know my name! Buffet is closing? They will bring you fresh food from the kitchen. I love this place!"}

Also tried the gumbo which was pretty tasty. I got the Cobb salad which is huge. I should have ordered the half portion. Cobb salad was really good."}
{"text":"Prologue: My fiancee and I were on our own for this Thanksgiving Day, so we decided to let somebody else do the cooking, and it turned out be a very good decision.   The Plot: Their traditional Thanksgiving buffet offered all of the following standard items: Roasted Turkey (including, to my delight, drumsticks and wings - more about that later) with Sage Pan Gravy, Brown Sugar Glazed Ham, Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Caramelized Onion Stuffing, French Green Bean Casserole with Crispy Onions, Maple and Pecan Glazed Sweet Potatoes, Orange-Cranberry Sauce, House Salad (with Dried Cranberries, Gorgonzola Cheese, Candied Walnuts, Mixed Baby Greens, Balsamic Vinaigrette), and Pies, Tarts, Cakes, and Cookies for dessert.   The Scene: To put it simply, this was the perfect, traditional Thanksgiving dinner we would all like to have at home without any worries or clean up and more time to enjoy lots of good food.  My portion of turkey consisted almost entirely of two wings. Lots of crispy, crunchy, perfectly seasoned skin along with a few bites of moist, tender meat and I was in turkey heaven. It's true that some of the meat on roasted turkey wings can be dry, but for me it's worth it in exchange for all that crispy, fatty goodness. My fiancee enjoyed more of the turkey breast and she was completely satisfied.  I truly liked the way the sweet potatoes were prepared, which was not mashed as I had expected. Instead, the potoatoes had been cut into cubes with skin on, probably prior to cooking, which added a wonderful texture. That, along with the perfect seasoning, resulted in what was perhaps the best sweet potato dish I've ever tasted.  My fiancee loved everything about the Green Bean Casserole, including the taste and texture of the beans, the consistency of the sauce, and crunchiness and seasoning of the topping.  The Apple Cranberry Tart easily satisfied my over active sweet tooth and the miniature Bûche de Noël was the perfect conclusion to a truly satisfying holiday meal.   The Rest of the Story: The dinner was well attended and we ended up being seated in the lobby adjacent to the buffet tables. Turns out that is was actually a little more roomy and comfortable out there and not too noisy or busy so we were quite content.  The price of $26 per person was well worth it for all of the good food and convenience.   Epilogue: We happily award 4 stars for a Thanksgiving meal that exceeded our expectations.
