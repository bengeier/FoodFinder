{"text":"This is one of my fave spots to wine, dine, and just chill on the patio. I've been here on numerous occasions and each time the food, service and atmosphere impressed me. I love their wide selection of wines and cocktails. The decor inside is exceptional and the patio is perfect for a warm summer days/nights. For me, the complimentary bread at the beginning of the meal is the greatest thing ever. It's super tasty and leaves me craving my next course. I've tried several of their pizzas - the pollo being my favorite. The shrimp salad was delicious as a side. Overall, it's the perfect place for a date night or for a group of friends out on the town."}
{"text":"It's a nice atmosphere and service is not bad. I enjoyed the first time I was there so I decided to buy the Living Social deal for a brunch back in October 2014. I was excited to use it but due to work and travel the coupon reached the expiration date. They refused to take the coupon after expiry even though newer/exact same deal was on via LivingSocial. I left a voicemail with the manager who never contacted me. I may have lost the $35, but sadly, I don't feel like supporting a business that doesn't appreciate repeated customers. My advise to those buying these deals: make sure you can stick to the reservation before the coupon expiration date. Cibo will not budge. You can however use the face value anytime. But then again will I really be excited to use the expired coupon just so I can get my money back? I will be happier at so many other deserving restaurants that offer great food and service."}
{"text":"Came here for the Summerlicious dinner. The atmosphere is great and the service is good. The bread is delicious, served with olives and rosemary. Each table has its own bottle of olive oil. The first course - ricotta ravioli with shrimp - was superb. The second course - salmon with asparagus- wasn't tasty. I would recommend sticking to pizza or pasta (it's what my brother-in-law and sister had and they both loved it). The desert was good but not great."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner today. Second time I have been there . food was good but our drinks took 15 min, they comped our bottle of water but my second martini glass had lip stick on it. Yup, I'm not a girl. That was comped as well but not impressed. Food good, service, big meh. 

This place has the exact same items as ciao in Yorkville and even though its the sane company that owns it. A much better experience there. Worth a try but read everyone's reviews I hope they are."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Busy and full on a Saturday night. Very slow service. Took about 40 mins for the food to come - if not longer. Waitress did not check up on our table. Had to flag her down for a refill on drinks. I had the seafood linguine. Pretty bland, but atleast there was a decent amount of seafood in it. I would go back to this location for drinks at the bar (maybe the service will be faster there). For better food and better service, stick to the King Street location!"}
{"text":"I like this place - I've been there about 10 times since the summer of last year and I have always had a good time. I find that the atmosphere is best on a thursday or friday night. It's a big restaurant and I've never had to wait for a table which has become something rare in Toronto. The prices are reasonable, especially for the pasta made in house. The cocktails are also good. I've never had a problem with the service. Overall, a good place for a date, a girls night, or a group of friends."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fantastic and the service is great... unfortunately, the food is terrible. It's only the second time I've ever sent food back to the kitchen. I then ordered a Caesar salad because I thought it would a safe replacement. It was also bland and tasteless."}
{"text":"I quite liked Cibo on our first visit, soon after opening. But a second visit revealed clumsy service and food that was just barely okay. 

If you're not picky about your food you'll find nothing wrong here and will probably like the vibrant atmosphere. But if you are a foodie your first disappointment will be finding out you can't order the grilled artichokes out-of-season even though they've been on the menu since day one. Your second disappointment will be the just-okay quality of the food. You'll overlook the clumsy service because the junior servers are probably just inexperienced. But then you'll wish you'd gone to Buca instead."}

{"text":"First, the'positive' ...visually, the restaurant looks nice...
The negative....everything else. Despite having a reservation, the hostess looked confused on our arrival and said that they would have to clear some tables before we would be seated. After being seated, we waited a long time for anyone to acknowledge us,  bring water, etc,,,despite waiters serving all the tables around us. Finally, the manager saw we had not been helped and came over  to our table. We placed our entire order with him ... We ordered drinks, a salad and mains...however drinks didn't arrive until we were halfway through eating our salad...when mains arrived, I noticed that there didn't seem to be calamari in my seafood risotto even though it clearly started on the menu that it contained calamari. What I did find were 6 tiny single  slimy tentacles that looked like they were thrown into the dish raw rather than being thrown in he garbage where they belonged...after questioning the waiter about this, he agreed that there were no calamari in the risotto, however, upon returning from the kitchen and speaking to the chef, he told me that those were infact the calamari and they were part of the sauce...I didn't eat the dish since it was not to my liking and not what was stated on the menu and when the waiter cleared the table, he did not question how the meal was or even ask if we wanted The dish packed up to go. When we asked for the bill, the uneaten risotto was on it...I had no problem paying for what I ordered and ate which fulfilled it's description as per the menu but was overall not great (watered down tasting aperol spritz and relatively bland arugula and mushroom salad) however, I could not understand paying for food that was not appetizing nor as desribed on the menu. At this point, the waiter told me that if I didn't pay for it, then he would have to pay for it and that I would need to speak to the manager. The manager ( same man that had to take out order because our waiter was extremely inattentive and had already ignored us for 10 minutes) was understanding and pleasant and apologized...the waiter was probably one of the most crass and inattentive that I have ever experienced. Overall, Cibo is pretty expensive for poor quality food and service and I will not be returning here. It seems like more of a place to 'be seen' than to have a quality dining experience. There are many other fantastic restaurants in the area and unfortunately, this is not one of them."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday night at 10pm and the place was really busy. I was here with a couple of girl friends before we headed out for drinks so we ordered food but didn't get any wine although I must say the variety of wine they had in store was impressive. We had ordered the gnocchi in Gorgonzola sauce, black tiger shrimps In a spicy marinara sauce and lobster ravioli. The tiger shrimps were very tasty - enough spice to give the dish a kick but not overbearing. The gnocchi wasn't anything special, we didn't end up eating much of that. The lobster ravioli had good potential - made with fresh al dente pasta and filled with real lobst but was not thoroughly heated and was served cold in the middle. Not the best experience , especially for the first time coming here .. But I'd give it another try in the future."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was so romantic and alive! This place is always busy and we finally had to try it. Alana is a knowledgeable and truly charismatic waitress. My husband and I didn't know what to order but Alana saved the night with her perfect recommendations. It was our anniversary and Alana made it extra special...from her wine suggestion to dessert she was an all around star! We had the best time and she contributed!
We will be back...and we know who we will be requesting to serve us!"}
{"text":"I hosted my sister's baby shower at Cibo on Yorkville today. They were nothing short of outstanding! We had 50 guests, and throughout the event they (discreetly) attended to our every need, and ensured that the guests were comfortable and well fed. The food was fantastic (pizzas, polenta fries, lamb parpadelle, gnocchi, and shrimp fettuccine) and plentiful. They were also great in allowing us to spice up the venue with some decor (although the venue is just stunning), and even did blue cocktails for the guests when they arrived. The staff were friendly, and did not get impatient, or annoyed at all...even when we lingered a bit longer than we should have. I was nervous about this event - but Cibo ensured that it was stellar ! A big warm thank-you to CIBO!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Absolutely loved the food here. We go salad a few apps, a pizza and a pasta dish and everything was exceptional. Also, the service was wonderful. Overall I was very impressed - will definitely go again!

Thanks Cibo!!"}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday here and got the private room. It was okay. The restaurant was really dead and the ambience was quite. I was expecting a different and more hip environment I guess.

I choose a menu where all my guest choose their own food for each course and it was okay. Defiantely not work 70$ a head. Nothing stood out.

Service was excellent though and can't complain there. Food was meh. Defiantely not worth the $2000 bill"}
{"text":"Horrible service last night.  We will never go back.  Food was good but nothing special. Server had a horrible attitude.  For a $400 dinner bill we could have had a wonderful experience at so many restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance. Service was a bit slow to get started but made up for it as the night went on. Food varied. Salads were great, did not find the pizza to be anything special but the chicken parmigiana was actually great. Love the feel of Liberty Entertainment's restaurants and would come back."}
{"text":"I came here for Sunday brunch through a Groupon deal and I wouldn't suggest this to anyone.  The service was terrible starting with the unenthusiastic hostess who sat behind her desk and didn't greet us upon entry.  She seemed to hate her job but it's the management's fault for not setting any standards. I quickly explained to her that I had reservations but couldn't get through the phones to let them know I'll be arriving late. She mumbled that they don't pick up phones during service hours... Go figure she was just slouched behind a desk. Not a good first impression. 

We were seated right away but as I let the waitress know that we have a Groupon voucher her mood changed instantly. It only got worse as we got our food and after a third round of plates, everything was still left on the table! I had no place to put my fresh plate of food and I had to ask her if she could take away some of the plates! What kind of service are they providing if the paying customer has to ask the waitress to do her job?! She mumbled sorry but didn't seem happy about it. I could understand if she was busy but we could see her taking plates away from other tables and even asked if they wanted salt and pepper for their eggs. By then I have had enough of this pretentious place and asked for the bill soon after.  I did not enjoy the meal at all because of bad customer service right from the get-go, although the brunch had potential of making the place appealing. To be fair I liked their decor but if that's the only thing they can offer then I'll most likely never return and give them my business. The basic principle of a restaurant establishment is to provide a good experience for customers to tell their friends about it and to return, but this was far from it. This place has so much potential but management needs to step it up. 
Side note, as a decent human being we still tipped 15% on the regular priced brunch even though they didn't deserve it."}
{"text":"What a horribly overpriced restaurant.

But let's try to start out nice. The restaurant itself is gorgeous; it's spacious, not too loud, great vibe. We sat on the patio which is spacious and nice enough - could use a bit more lighting as I had to use the single candle that was on the table to read the menu.

My happiness with the place ends there. Our waitress was pushy, and by that I mean she only gave recommendations on the most expensive items on the menu. We ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio for the table. I foolishly did not see that they had a cheaper bottle being offered for Summerlicious. I feel our waitress *could* have made the suggestion, but didn't. She also didn't advise us to get the Summerlicious menu as it may not have filled anyone up. Judging by the portions of the ACTUAL meals, I'm sure the Summerlicious menu would have been the better choice.

My husband got the lobster cannelloni which arrived at the table with two cannelloni in a sea of sauce. They were not big enough for anyone to be full off of, so we had to order a pizza afterward. I myself ordered the linguine with chicken, pesto and olive oil.  You'd think with pesto and olive oil in the list of ingredients the pasta would be flavourful and moist. This was THE MOST dry pasta I have ever ordered in my life. It was awful. I had to pour on a boatload of olive oil just to choke it down. The pasta tasted like it was a few days old. 

The pizza itself was large enough and delicious. I'd opt to go for pizza rather than main meals if you want to be full when you leave.

When the bill came I just felt depressed. Way too much money for a mediocre night out. So overall I would say this place is not worth it unless you're going for a few drinks and appetizers. I walked out feeling like I had paid for a feast but was still hungry at the end of it all."}
{"text":"Got the shrimp salad, I know what you're thinking why a salad at an Italian place but I do what I want. It was fine, nothing particularly amazing about it or nothing bad. A 3 out of 5. 

Service was good. Would return to try out the carb side of the menu."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of people for a Friday night dinner on opening night. The ambiance was great, with a lounge area in the front and comfortable booths in the back. The food was great, so was the wine an service...its Italian food. Going back again tonight and looking forward to it."}
{"text":"I went to Cibo for lunch on a Sunday and it was fairly empty but the patio was half full. It was early and a Sunday so it was expected.
Cibo is a gorgeous restaurant! Very elegant but not too fancy shmancy! A great place for after work dinner or drinks, or weekend dinner with significant other or girls nights!

I had a lamb pasta and it was to die for! Extremely delicious and the portion size was fairly large! I combined that with their signature mojito and it was delicious as well. 

The pricing isnt too bad, very comparable to Teronni! About $18 for my plate of pasta and $9 for my drink!

They have an awesome Sunday brunch menu - $35 gets you a 3 course meal  and 2 glasses or prosecco I believe!

All in all service was great and it was a pleasant experience! I would totally recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant was extremely busy on a Saturday night. Had a reservation and still had to wait over 30 mins to get seated. Bar area was full so getting a drink wasn't that easy either. Had the tuna entree which was really tasty and a decent size. Service was okay but the restaurant was too busy for service to be excellent.  Private dining rooms are spacious and provide for an enjoyable dinner with better service."}
{"text":"I've been twice and loved it both times.  Flawless service and the food was good.  BUT, what I liked the most was the atmosphere - the venue is awesome.  I had Pizza Margherita the first time I was there and I had a salad and octopus the second time.  Pretty decent meals, but not the best I'ver had - hence the 4 star rating - all else is a 5!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere - large space, really nicely decorated, comfortable seating, lots of room at each table so that you are not eating out of your neighbour's plate.
Staff - very attentive and somewhat knowledgeable. I suggest a bit better training is needed to educate about the specials (we were there for quattro-sette).
Food - yummy! We had two pizzas and both loved what we ordered. i agree that the pizza is 8/10.
Drinks - 2 cocktails - both delish - and a glass of red wine. All went down really nicely.

I recommend the Quattro-Sette - great deals!"}
{"text":"Terrific atmosphere. Open fresh and excellent service, thx Brittany .
Homemade pasta, seared tuna was cooked perfectly. Wine selection wonderful. 
If you get a chance to see the wire act getting the wine was fantastic 

Give it a chance."}
{"text":"Reasonable food, but service was meh.

I get the \"one bill per table\" but you aren't going to get a lunchtime crowd with that attitude or with servers who are oblivious as to how groups want to share bills.

Our server just disappeared and didn't tell us why our dessert was late, then when the bill came she bailed again, we waited 20 minutes to get it settled! We were all late for meetings returning to work."}
{"text":"Good experience every time I go...  
The apps and main dishes are well prepared and very tasty Italian food. I always find my self struggling to finish the whole meal. Order an app and a main plus the tasty bread u get at the start of your meal your gonna be taking leftovers home lol 
I find now that when I go now as a couple we just share everything with just one main and both still full. Happy eating :)"}
{"text":"Love the decor
Convenient location- would be even better with free parking
Service is friendly and efficient
Came for summerlicious lunch $18 for three courses
The food was solid- except the salmon was overcooked. Polenta fries were yummy! Pizza was fresh. Canelloni was also delicious. My friend didn't enjoy the chicken fusilli though. Coffee was mediocre.
Overall a great place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Had Sunday brunch here today for $35 there is a nice buffet of foods and includes a mimosa or glass of prosecco. the offerings included: a Waffle Station, custom omelets, made to order & pre-made pizzas, brushetta, cold cuts, mussels, squid, smoked salmon, salad bar, 3 types of pastas/3 types of pasta sauces,sausage/bacon/potates, bread area-with crossiants/bagels/danishes/mini donuts, 4 types of cheeses, aracini balls, polenta fries and pre-made pastas, fruit salad and there was a large variety of desserts, but leaned towards quantity rather than quality.

The hi light for me was the pizza with prosciutto/onions/mushrooms. The polenta fries w/ gorgonzola sauce were unique. The aracini balls were also good.   The smoked salmon benedict was too hard poached for my liking, that aside all in all a nice brunch spot. The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian restaurant. The food is authentic and home made! It's always fresh. The environment is also fun and nice for a family dinner or a fun night out with friends. Always a good experience and well recommended!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pick-up pizza from Cibo and it was good. I gave it 8 out of 10 (10 out of 10 being  Pizzeria Libretto pizza). It was made in the wood burning oven and was very tasty. Loved the decor of the place. Will be back for a sit down dinner."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I see that our experience happens a lot at this restaurant. When we first walked into this establishment both my partner and I commented on how beautiful this place is. We asked our server Elaina if she could offer a wine selection and when she said she couldn't we asked if 
there was someone else that could. She seemed to take offence to this and that's when our dinner went downhill. She sent Marchello the manager over and he was great! Our server ignored us for the rest of the night. After 20 minutes we asked her for some bread as she was passing by and she mumbled it's not ready yet. She stood at the bar flirting with the bartender most of the night. When another waitress passed by we asked her for bread and it came right away. We had yet another server stop by to fill our glasses. We asked another server for more bread while our server was still at the bar flirting. The food came about 40 mins later. We spoke with the manager and he apologized for the experience we had with our server, stating \"she is normally on her game\".  The food itself was outstanding. Lobster stuffed pasta and a seafood risotto was hot and flavourful.  The wine from prince Edward country was excellent.  In the end the manager acknowledged our concerns and went over the top to make sure we left on a good note. Now after writing a review like this I often wonder if management read these and take initiative to address the concerns of the reviewer."}
{"text":"Top Notch!!! We had never been here before so  I was a bit worried when we booked the party room for our company's 20th   anniversary.   I was concerned about not 
 being able to order a-la-carte and never experienced the \"family style\" serving 
 before.   We ordered the SOCIAL menu 3, at $65 per  person.  It was worth every penny.  It was 14 courses, all of which were amazing  (CIBO SERVICE STYLE CHEF'S SELECTION OF 
 SIGNATURE PIZZAS, POLENTA FRIES, BEEF CARPACCIO, ARANCINI, SPIDUCCI, GRILLED OCTOPUS, POLPETINNE, GNOCCHI, RAVIOLI, ORECCIETTE, VEAL MILANESE, POLLO  PARMIGIANA, SALMONE FRESCO ATLANTICO, SEASONAL VEGETABLES and CHEF'S SELCETION  DESSERT PLATTER).  The food was ample and  had something for everyone on the menu.  The  service was outstanding, the attention to detail they provided was 
 exceptional.   I recommend this establishment for any private  function.   The way the table is set allowed for  conversation, even across the table because the room was sectioned off from the  restaurant so you can hear everyone (ours was a table for 16).  We are already planning to have our company Christmas party here.  You will not be disappointed.   This
 place is top notch."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor. But that's where it ends. Olive Garden has better food. This is \"wannabe\" Italian all the way, preying on unsuspecting and untraveled locals who get fooled by the decor. Service is nice, just untrained with no attention to detail. Sorry, but very disappointing."}
{"text":"You will see by my one star rating I was left disappointed following my recent visit to this restaurant and here is why. 
Last week I had a friend from out of town visiting.  I had never been to Cibo but from what I had seen from the decor and menu it looked perfect.  We didn't have reservations and arrived at around 8pm on a Tuesday and were seated right away.  The presentation of the restaurant is really stunning. High glass walls filled with wine bottles. Beautiful wooden floors. Stunning bar area with every possible drink presented high to the ceiling on shelves behind the bartender.  With everything so perfect I expect the whole evening to be perfect.   
We were seated in a section where there is a long bench seat on one side and the other side of the table are chairs. My friend first of all sat on the bench seat and I sat on the chair. When she sat down she could barely see over the table so we swapped. I am almost six feet tall and I too felt very uncomfortable as the seat seemed far too low.  The menu looked nice, I love Italian food so thought I was in for a real treat.  I ordered Fettucine alfredo for $19 and added chicken to it for $3 My friend ordered Penne for $19.  Wine was $19 a glass so we just ordered a bottle for $54.  

Fresh bread was then brought to the table with a little dish of very hot chillies.  The bread was lovely and actually the best part of the meal. The chillies did not go well with it all and were way too hot ( I love hot food by the way) It would have worked better served with nice oils in a dish to dip the bread in. When I said how hot it was to my friend, two women sat next to us said \"I think their trying to kill us\" 

Our meals arrived in about fifteen minutes. We were both offered fresh pepper and grated cheese. I accepted both. I then took a bite of my pasta and chicken. One word can sum it up. \"Boring\"  It was the most flavourless, tasteless and boring dish I have ever had in my life.  I can only assume they did not salt the water or add any salt to the chicken.  The sauce was bland. I expected a nice creamy sauce with hints of garlic and cracked pepper I ended up with something that more or less resembled skim milk (even that might have had more flavour) and the chicken was completely dry and tasteless.  I couldn't add salt as there was no salt on any of the tables and the waitress never came back to check to see how our meal was, perhaps she had gone across the road to buy more skim milk. 
My friends meal was just as tasteless. Honestly I have had better, more flavoursome pasta served to me on a plane whilst flying coach, and we all know that's widely regarded as some of the worst food one will ever eat.  
It's always a bad sign when the free bread at a restaurant is the best part of the meal.

I am sure the owners will read this review and disagree however I have nothing to gain from leaving a negative review, I eat almost anything and hardly ever complain. I am only leaving this to warn others. I had one week with my friend and ruined one of our evenings eating disgusting tasteless food that's only fit to be severed in a high school cafeteria. What upset me the most is that the restaurant is so impressive and after I saw and tasted the food I felt as though I had been conned. I can't be the only customer that would rather see money spent on better quality food and improved training for the chefs, rather then an impressive wine rack and fancy chandeliers. (Or at least buy some salt shakers and allow the customers to add flavour to the food if the chefs are too incompetent to do it themselves) 
The previous restaurant before Cibo, Centro, closed its doors and it's really only a matter of time till Cibo suffers the same fate.

UPDATE: I emailed CIBO head office as was told to by the staff and of course they never got back to me. Now I know where the wait staff learn their manners from about coming back to check if a customers meal is ok."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place: the wine, food, service, and atmosphere are all great.

I've only been here for dinner but a few specific recommendations would be: 
- polenta fries with gorgonzola dip (quite possibly my favourite appetizer ever)
- gnocchi with gorgonzola cream sauce
- seafood linguine (solid amount of seafood)
- grilled octopus
- chocolate baci bombe 

I haven't tried the pizzas yet but I plan on it. And basically any pasta you get will be great because you can really taste its freshness. Great quality stuff! And the extensive list of wines always makes for a great excuse to try something new.

Service is good here from the servers. Attentive and really friendly.

The place is really big, too, it looks like it would be perfect for larger groups since there are a few private rooms/areas. Birthdays or staff party outings seemed to be in attendance. But also perfect for a romantic night for two.

Overall, great quality and always a good time."}
{"text":"Great service all around, our server was very friendly and gave us great suggestions.  What we enjoyed particularly was the complimentary bread and chilli oil the cane with the meal. A MUST GO!"}
{"text":"Really nice decor and great atmosphere. Food is good as well. You have to get the polenta fries. The mushroom risotto is Delish and not too heavy."}
{"text":"Just a little disclaimer that this happened last year (just trying to catch up on my reviews) so I hope the failings have been addressed.

My parents were in town from England on business for the international film festival, and only had only free evening of the trip so I wanted a nice restaurant in my neighbourhood to celebrate us all being together for the fist time in Toronto since I moved here. I made a reservation for their earliest available spot at 9PM, and due to the torrential rain that evening, we were delayed by 10 minutes. The hostesses were incredibly rude as soon as we got in and said our table was not ready and to wait at the bar (where a lot of others with reservations were also waiting). 

We politely waited at the bar, and checked in with the hostess 10 minutes later, who said that the table was still not ready as they had taken so many reservations that evening. At 9:30 we said that it had been 30 minutes after our initial reservation to which the hostess retorted that it was only 20 because we were 10 minutes late. I had so many issues with this comment: a) it was plain rude, b) regardless, if we have a reservation it shouldn't matter since it should have been ready for us at 9, with a small grace period if we we running behind, c) 20 minutes is still getting to the point of unacceptable time to wait for a restaurant reservation, d) it lay blame on us, even though there were many others who had reservations and were still lumped at the bar so it was just to deflect their poor management of reservations.

At 9:45 - 45 minutes after our reservation, we were finally seated. The food was over-priced for what it was - bland and not worth the wait at all. The waiters were really trying but you could see they were overwhelmed by the amount of patrons. 

The only thing going for this place was the interior, which is a really vibrant design and has a trendy ambiance, and is the only reason I brought my review up to 2 star. The attitude of the hostesses left a bad taste in our mouths the entire evening which is a shame, but Yonge and Eglinton has so many great restaurants to offer that you can't treat the locals (or anyone actually) like that if you want to build loyal patronage - and they lost this one."}
{"text":"Went twice. 1st time was my Anniversary. Server had a bad attitude. Didn't even do bear minimum. Food was overly (I mean EXTREMELY) salty. Both of us had pasta dishes. My husband had to eat my plate cause his was so uneatable. Server never came by to ask about food. Didn't refill our water glasses once. Never came around. When finished she saw the full plate of my husbands untouched pasta & just cleared the table without one word. We were too disappointed to bother. Frankly we didn't want dinner to ruin our nite. My husband asked for the manger (which is rear) n expressed our awful experience. Said he'd rather tell her in person then write a review. All she offered was alcohol. As we weren't looking for freebees, we declined. Plus our mouths were so dry from the excess salt. Needless to say it was below basic standards for the price and experience. But I'm posting this now b/c of my second experience - also bad!! 
I got convinced to try it again. Same thing but worse! Order pasta. Very oily n bland. Had the caesar. Chef should be ashamed  to have sent out wilted salad. $10 bucks for rotten food. Ridiculous. I wont return, n defiantly do not recommend."}
{"text":"Went for a brunch birthday party and the buffet style menu selection pleasantly surprised me. lots of variety and food was all delicious. wonderful Italian style brunch. enjoyed it very much.  will definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch! The pizzas are amazing and so are the deli meats and cheeses! Pasta station is great too! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out three times now - all disappointing. I can't speak to the quality of the food because all three times my group and I left early after experiencing terrible service. I've been a waitress and I'm usually pretty easygoing about service, especially if the place is busy so I returned on a quieter night. We were ignored for most of the evening by the ladies chatting up a storm at the bar and had to ask several times for the drink menu. Very frustrating experience. Pretentious and rude. Too bad, I live around the corner but I won't be going back here for a very long time - I'd rather travel to the other Cibo locations."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst restaurants I've been to. Server took over 10 minutes to greet us, we ordered 4 dishes and all were bland. Tasted like canned tomato sauce. Pizza was soggy and not cooked through. Overall, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch great! Amazing made to order fresh pasta and pizza, real parmigiana reggiano , best rice balls ever! Nice atmosphere and friendly service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The ambience is nice and the service is good however the food is just bland. If you're making reservations for date night, make sure you're seated upstairs ( more lively). The food is average, a bit overrated possibly because of the location."}
{"text":"We were 3 couples went to Cibo Wine Bar on a Thursday night without reservation and we waited about 5-6 minutes to seat. I have to say there were several empty tables, but the host preferred not to offer them immediately. We ordered Chardonnay withe wine 2013 but we served with 2014! Which was a wired move by a Wine Bar restaurant. The server was quite confused, as we ordered our pizza, and one of the orders was Americano and the server brought an Americano Coffee instead! Pizza was delicious. Despite their poor service I liked the decorations and the ambience."}
{"text":"I live around the corner and have been many times.
The food is always delicious and well-prepared.  If there was an odd occasion that something was off, they did not hesitate to bring it back and correct it.  This goes a long way in my books.

My girlfriend and I went to their Sunday brunch and were both very impressed with the selection.  There was also great music playing, which was a great atmosphere for two people recovering from a late night out.

Will continue to visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"I cannot express how unhappy I was with the dinner I had at Cibo. If you're considering it, go elsewhere. 

We attended on a Friday night without any reservations. The hostess said it would be a 15/20 minute wait and directed us to the bar. The hostess turned out to be apocalyptically bad at assessing wait times as it took an hour and a half to get a table. I wish CIBO would have just told us they were too busy to seat us - we would have gone somewhere else bust instead they kept telling us it would only be 10 minutes. 

At the bar we ordered drinks - I hated the grapefruit cocktail I ordered: all you tasted was the bitter, no grapefruit taste at all.  Also, my guest who does not drink, asked for a mocktail and the bartender refused telling her that they didn't have any mixes, which seemed odd for a bar. 

We ordered the polenta fries which were the only good thing about the night. I also ordered a ceasar salad and a soup. The soup was good but the salad was a joke. $14 was so over priced for the small portion you get. I also had to ask for dressing because it came without. 

I get that at some of the nice places in Toronto some of the plates are over priced. But atleast you expect the service to be good. Our waiter practically slammed the plates down and ran, rather than chat with us and see how we are doing. It was obvious he was over burdened - but that shouldn't be at our expense. 

There are much more authentic Italian restaurants in Toronto with better prices and service - don't waste your time and money at a CIBO establishment."}
{"text":"Pretty surprised by the negative reviews for Cibo Wine Bar. Being a bit of a Yelp snob, when my colleague recommended this place time and time again, I kept pointing out how poor the reviews were and how there seemed to be better choices around. However, having been to Cibo twice now and as someone who admittedly holds high standards in terms of service and food, I've really enjoyed my experiences at Cibo. 

I went to Cibo once for lunch and once for dinner, and neither times did I feel as if service was lacking in any way. I'm a huge fan of the complimentary bread they give you and the peppers they leave on the table. So fresh and delicious! Everything I've had at Cibo has been either good or great, with frontrunners being the Mushroom Risotto and the Linguine with Seafood. It's a pretty good price for the quality of food. 

The first time I came here I was with a group of around 20 people for a work lunch. The food came quickly and did not lose out on quality. On top of that, they were very gracious in assisting us in splitting the bill. The second time, I was with a group of middle school friends I hadn't seen in almost a decade, and the waiters were very patient in letting us sit there and chat and drink even well after dinner. 

To top it off, I'm into the decor of the place, especially the skull bottles, the wine \"cellar\" right in the middle of the restaurant, and the somewhat creepy portraits of girls near the bathroom area. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone, but I do agree that the By the Glass wine menu is lacking."}
{"text":"Good spot to meet before heading off to the TSO.

Enjoyed a glass of wine.  Appreciated having a selection of more than 2 - 3 wines sold by the glass.

My friend and I shared the grilled whole calamari - nicely done and served on a bed of greens - and fried jumbo shrimp served with zucchini strings.  Both were decent.

Service was attentive, friendly and not intrusive......always appreciated."}
{"text":"Every once in a while, you think you've found the next 'it' spot and can't wait to try it. This was me last night, and boy did I leave disappointed. 

Ambiance is fantastic - decor is stunning, location amazing. Wine selection good. But the food - oh the food - it was CRAP. Bruschetta was served on cold, cold, cold bread and tasted like nothing. No tomato flavor, not a bit of garlic,...nothing! Margarita pizza was garbage (one person compared it to frozen McCain pizza) and the ravioli which sounded superb (how can you mess up rose sauce & pine nuts?), turned out bland and boring. 

We were so disappointed we opted out of dessert and went elsewhere to finish our meal on a positive note. 

Come here for the wine and ambiance, but do not, I mean DO NOT, eat here. You will be thoroughly wasting your money on poor quality food."}
{"text":"CIBO has definitely one of the best brunch the city can offer.  one of the managers Victoria was very helpful & attentive.... 
Service is top notch & we couldn't ask for more ... All you can eat for $35 is do worth it !!!
You guys are awesome ... Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"went with some friends and had great time! Service was very attentive and food was good!"}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night. The serving staff was cool and indifferent. No interaction whatsoever... We were seated 'upstairs .' We had a reservation but it was not needed. We were initially seated next to the pizza ovens. (Kitchen) Our table was 'wonky' so we asked to be seated elsewhere. They were quick to accommodate, and since there were several open 4somes we were immediately moved.
As I mentioned staff was not engaging so why would we let them know that we were celebrating our daughter's  21st Birthday?!
The wine list it extensive... We are not wine connoisseur's so we easily found a $40-50 bottle of Italian Red.
Salad starters were OK. The Caesar salad was bland and totally uneventful. My daughter and I shared the Radicchio/Arugula with feta and olives. It was better- presentation was lacking however. Perhaps sprinkling crumbled feta would have helped. There were 6-8 cut up chunks that got lost in the salad. 
All 3 of us ordered Gourmet Pizzas... 
We might as well have ordered cardboard! The crusts were so hard and dry not even the knife could cut it. The Smoked Salmon pizza which my daughter would always order when living in Paris was dry- no créme fraiçhe to give it texture or flavour. I ordered the Capresse Pizza- same thing, dry and bland. I couldn't find the Buffalo Motz. My husband's as well was tasteless. Not even the Italian salami spiced it up. 
I don't think the server asked us how things were. I don't think he cared to be honest. 
To top off the experience it was hotter than a pizza oven up there. Seriously hot!!! 
The best part of the evening was walking back (on a cold January evening) to the dorm and having Birthday cake with out daughter. 
If this is a new establishment then good luck. I imagine people who regularly dine in Yorkville will make it a one of... I know we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Would definitely come back. Nice ambiance, atmosphere, good food and wine. 
Noise level was moderate so you could have a conversation. 

I would recommend."}
{"text":"the food is decent however the service is ridiculously slow.  we went for lunch, even thought the place was half empty it took 20 minutes for anyone to come over despite attempts to make eye contact with one of several employees walking by. 
Despite having told the server we were in a bit of a hurry (becaue we had already spent 20 minutes of our lunch hour waiting) we did not manage to leave until after 230 (almost 2 hours after arrival) most of that time was spent trying to get someone' s attention to pay.  Finally we stood with our jackets on waiting for someone to notice, which they still didn't, we had to chase down several employees in order to pay

don't think I will be going back food is not so good it is worth that kind of wait"}
{"text":"I made reservations for Sunday brunch and when we got there I noticed there was a station with an open peanut butter and Nutella container that was opened and area had been contaminated with these. If you are someone with a peanut allergy I would strongly recommend you go somewhere else. Normally peanut butter is provided in self sealed packets.

I do not recommend this restaurant if you have a peanut or hazelnut allergy."}
{"text":"Went there for Winterlicious and it was very good. Arugula prosciutto salad, spicy salami pizza and vanilla bean pana cotta. Salami is very spicy. The only thing was that our entrée came earlier than expected as we were still enjoying the apps. Although she did kindly apologized for that. Otherwise service was friendly and great. Will likely try this place out for regular menu."}
{"text":"Our first time dining at this establishment. A little bit on the noisy side. 
We had:
- Grilled calamari: Nicly cooked, but a bit small for the price.
- Lobster ravioli: Sauce was delicious. Pasta was nicely formed and cooked, but the filling was quite salty.
- Funghi pizza: My favorite item of the night. Thin crust. Nice mushrooms. Very well put together!

Overall, the food was pretty good. Simple dishes generally nicely done. Three stars only because I think the price was a bit high for this simple food."}
{"text":"The place is nice as well as he ambiance. The food, at best, gets a 2 from me. We ordered the carbonara and spicy spaghetti. The carbonara resembled Alfredo with spaghetti noodles with little flavor. The spicy pasta was a little too spicy. Not too spicy where you couldn't eat it but any additional spice and the flavor of the tomato sauce would have been flat. Our lips were burning after eating that, and I had only had two forkfuls. 

I wouldn't recommend this place or go back for the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Teeeerrrible service. The hostess and waitress both had a very bad attitude. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I came here with 3 other coworkers for their winterlicious lunch. The food was well presented and fairly tasty. You also can't beat the price at $15 for a 3 course lunch meal. 

So why only 3 stars? SERVICE. The server was rude and seemed annoyed when we asked her where our food was. We were there for 1.5 hours. Her response was, \"for these meals you need more time\". Really? 1.5 hours isn't enough? 

I would only come back for winterlicious."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for a few days. I'm a very frequent visitor and my usual hangout is One (right across the street). I wanted to switch it up so I gave Cibo a try because it was right across the street from my hotel. When I arrived the hostess asked if I had a reservation to which I replied that I didn't. She then turns around to her assistant and shouts \"just a walk in\". Excuse me? To paraphrase an earlier reviewer, that is a disrespectful, unacceptable, and tactless response. I had just walked in the front door and I already had a foul taste in my mouth. I was seated.

It was around 11:45 am on a Sunday, I expected their would be a brunch menu of sorts, but like most establishments, by that hour a regular lunch menu would surely be available. I was really wrong.

Not only did they only serve brunch, apparently on Sundays the brunch is available as a buffet exclusively. In other words, no table service. Yet ironically I had a waitress whose only purpose was to serve drinks. I'm sorry, If I wanted a buffet, I'd go to a Holiday Inn. I was jet lagged from flying six hours from LA and landing at seven in the morning. For the money I'm paying I want my food to be brought to me and frankly, buffets are pedestrian and blase.

Then I discovered the empty water glass on my table. It was completely covered in a repulsive white film (god knows what that was), complete with lip marks. I immediately left without ordering anything."}
{"text":"2.5/5! Great ambiance and awesome wine selection. However, the pizza and pasta is not as authentic as other places. average Italian food - would not go again."}
{"text":"Went here last night for date night and I was blown away. The decor is stunning, the wine cellar is gorgeous just to look at! The good was amazing. Great service. They make homemade pasta and I was looking at a pasta dish that didn't use the homemade pasta out sever told me I could change to the homemade pasta which was a great recommendation. I thought being downtown and a little more upscale the portions were going to be small but I was wrong. The portions are huge and they are not cheap with the protein in the dish. My bf's shrimp pasta had 11 shrimps!! Amazing restaurant and can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This is a completely overrated restaurant. The clientele is completely trashy. Most importantly, for claiming to be an Italian restaurant, the food is completely terrible and dried out. My friends and I had various basic pasta dishes that any old nonna could crank out. All were dry, bland and tasteless. The value for this was extremely poor. When we complained to the manager, he could only reply with a smirk on his face. I wish this enterprise a swift death for the pollution they do to the fine Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"typical bait and switch place. They draw you in with promise of $25 Lobster on tuesdays and when you go, early evening, ofcourse it's finished. We had booked last Tuesday for 7pm. Got there on time, were given menus for lobster, after we ordered, were told, sorry all lobsters are finished, could we ordwe off the regular menu. The restaurant was not busy and unbelievable that all the lobsters finished before 7.30. Ofcourse we left. Beware these are unethical people and I'm sure the food is bad so they have to resort to these measures!"}
{"text":"This establishment needs a lot of work. 

I've dined at Cibo before on King and at Yonge and Eg. It seems like a no brainer that because I love wine and love the venue, why not host my birthday dinner here?

I couldn't be more wrong.The familiar but new thing didn't pan out. 

From the expected knowledgeable event planner, to the friendly hostess, to the experienced server, all the way over to the accommodating managers - we were disappointed. The event planner made a mistake with our party (parties of 10 do not HAVE to order from social menu), the hostess was inattentive and asked our party to escort themselves (\"you can walk around and find your party...\"), the server was absolutely inexperienced (poured the glass to taste and continued to fill the same glass), and managers accommodated by throwing the event planner under the bus and...that's about it.

We were told that for a party of 10 or more we MUST order from their social menu (fixed menu, options: $45, $55, $65). A menu that both the front of house and back of house could not execute or deliver. We waited a random assortment of times for items on the menu. In between dishes we would wait 10...40...12..19...then a good 60 minutes (yes, we were there for 5 bottles of wine and 3 hours). Only to find out that we didn't have to order from the social menu and you know what... maybe we did't have to order from there at all!

I mean, we all know you get what you pay for but we definitely did not pay a bill of $900 for that.

In hindsight - I would have spent both my dollars and experience points dining somewhere else."}
{"text":"If you want to call yourself a wine bar - you need to respect the grape!!! 

I was in and ordered a glass of prosecco  to get things started and I was delivered a glass of warm, flat, oxidized horror in a cup.  I was looking at it with dismay when a server came and swooped it out of my hands and said - oh is it flat? (Obviously!) I will get you another glass.  

Now wouldn't you think the person pouring that original glass in a WINE bar would notice it was warm, flat and stale?"}
{"text":"We visited this place for brunch a while back. 
Apparently, they don't do brunches anymore, which is a shame.  

The food was delicious and there was always a good selection to choose from.  The restaurant is in three levels, so it is not suitable for those who are mobility challenged.  

The kithen staff were great! 
They took the time to answer our questions and made suggestions when needed.  

The waitstaff was a missed.  It took a long time to get our drinks and our dishes were piles triple high, before anyone took the I initiative to remove them.  

We found the hostess were aloof and unfriendly.  

4+ stars for the food. 
3- for the front of the house staff
Overall score 3"}
{"text":"Been to this place twice..the decor is nice. The staff are OK. The ravioli and funghi pastas are very good. We also ordered arancini which was also good. Of you go late on Sunday night is not busy at all. So if you are looking to go somewhere busy make sure you go early Sunday night..Saturdays are packed. The portions and vibe are pretty good"}
{"text":"Romantic ambiance.... Good food and drinks... Perfect for a date night out or family dinner"}
{"text":"We have been to Cibo brunch on king street and in Miami 
The brunch offered at Cibo on Yonge street cannot compare to either.  King street had much , much better selection from hot meat selection to freshly made pasta.
Staff was more visible at King street.
We were at Yonge street today.  I had a soggy egg white omelette , an over cooked pizza and a couple of pieces of cheese and fruit.
I would never return nor would I ever suggest that anyone should go there.
It actually seemed that management had no interest in providing a truly enjoyable brunch."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews I was very skeptical but once we were done eating I was pleasantly surprised. While the hostess with short pink hair was just lazy and carefree (can come across as rude), but the waitress was wonderful and sweet. What to order: calamari, baked eggplant (ask for extra salt and pepper), and order the Quartro Stagioni pizza."}
{"text":"Did NOT enjoy my experience here. I will say, the food is good, but the whole experience was poor. The service is brutal. It was so bad, I almost left 3 times during my meal.  It was packed and they were really slow. My friend was late so I was eating alone and they refused to take my order - for 20 minutes. So I'm by myself with no appetizer or drink for 20 minutes, just sitting there. The servers barely even acknowledged me - I guess they were too busy with their drinking party table?  And when I first got there, they let about 20 people in before me, even though we had a reservation. I was early and they refused to let me in even 5 minutes early.  I would never go back because I found the staff to be too rude and incompetent."}
{"text":"Average tasting, overpriced food. I've been to this location twice for Sunday brunch and will not return. Service is slow and the food is average at best. Even GroupOn rate is overpriced."}
{"text":"Service: Average
Food: Good variety on the menu, however 2 out of 3 orders had salt on the higher side
Drinks: Good listing of wines and spirits
Price: Decent for the location and type"}
{"text":"Pretty good place for dinner with the girls! We were 6 people and some of us wanted drinks some wanted dinner. We had a reservation for Saturday night last week of December and they sat us right away. 

The ambiance and decor in this place is flawless. They have this incredible wine room with an acrobat in it. The tables aren't crowded and there's plenty is room to move around. Music is great, not too loud and obnoxious and everything about the atmosphere was fantastic.

Our server was full of charm for us. He was super sweet and helpful but he didn't write down our orders and a couple times made us repeat it to him. He didn't come back to check on us after drinks or dinner but the food and drinks came very quickly which was a plus. I understand the other reviews about the not great service. He was super friendly but not so attentive. 

I'm torn about how to review the food. I don't have a taste for fine food so keep that in mind. I love love very easy simple Italian food and found the food to be good just not spectacular. I got the Arancini and margharita Pizza. The Arancini was very good and all the portions were huge. The pizza was really so-so. It got very soggy very fast and was a little chewy. Some of the other things we ordered were the veggie calzone, some salads and gnocchi. Everyone said the food was good but we didn't rave, and truly the portions were quite big. The dessert was a little dissapointing, the gelato was freezer burned and the coffee too bitter. 

All in all a great place to meet for drinks with friends and fantastic atmosphere but slightly lackluster food."}
{"text":"The restaurant is really nice looking, couldn't stop looking around and seeing another area that I missed on my first pass.
The food is another story.
I ordered a lobster pasta. It was the first time I ever asked for salt in a restaurant. It didn't help. I tried adding some of the spicy sauce they put on table to dip your bread. Still bland.
My husband ordered the venison. A few slices of venison on top of an unknown crunchy grain, topped with some uncooked pieces of cabbage. That was $40 we could have spent better.
Overall, food was a miss, service was great."}
{"text":"Can to Cibo for a brunch with some girlfriends to complete a girls weekend.  It was really delicious.  There were options for freshly made pasta, & Pizza, both made to order.  They were delicious!  There was a massive antipasto bar and and a glass of Prosecco came with the brunch as well.  We all really enjoyed ourselves.  And the place was beautiful  I am thinking about coming back again with my hubby."}
{"text":"Let's star with the positive our 2 servers were excellent!  Now the rest :  The Hostess give me attitude because I asked to be seated in the 1st floor even though the restaurant was empty.
The food was very disappointing ( I really don't understand how this Restaurant is considered one of the 100 best Restaurants in Canada), incredible !  The appetizer lacked flavour,the pizza was burned, the ravioli by itself was pretty good but the sauce was tasteless.  The dessert Tiramisu is not made in house  ... how can one of the best restaurants in Canada doesn't make their own Tiramisu, or at least pick a supplier that makes a good one.  The expresso for an Italian is the seal of a meal, and the one that they serve was very disappointing. 
We will stick to our favourites Marcello's, Graze , La Vechia, Vedo and Soto Soto 

The 2 stars are because of the amazing service of our servers."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was cool, but food wasn't anything great. There was a fly in my salad and staff seemed unhappy."}
{"text":"Came here with a brunch Groupon ( 2 for $35) 

I will return during a brunch promotion, but not for the full price.

The brunch buffet was amazing, i had yogurt parfait, personalized pizza, sandwiches and dessert. I definitely left CIBO full. But if i were to pay $35 per person, based on what i listed, I would not get my money's worth.

I agree with what the reviews are saying, you really are paying for the vibe of the place."}
{"text":"to describe it in one word: unfortunate.

They have a great location and the place itself is really tastefully done - so much potential in this real estate.

The service is good however its probably the food at a restaurant most of us would be interested in - you think? we ordered the polenta fries as the starter - great presentation kind of like bulding blocks but poor on taste. I wasn't crazy about the accopmanying sauces either. So we asked if we could replace it with a bruschetta - strategic pick as we fiugured how can one mess up a bruschetta? well....the bread was not toasted enough and the tomatoe bits on the top although fresh were simply drained in oil and severaly lacking flavour. 

At this point we had read other yelp reviews and wished we had done that prior to being seated. We asked if our main which i was slightly curious to know if they would redeem themselves on a salad and margheritta pizza were being worked on and they weren't luckily so we asked for our orders to be cancelled and took the cheque.

On our way out the manager approached us to provide our feedback on our visit and wanted to learn what went wrong. We told him it was the food to which he replied \"oh was it just the food, that's okay then\" - REALLY? so if the service or the table setting was an issue that would grant a more concerned reaction from him? errmmm a restaurant that is okay with its bad food as long as everything else is okay? 
I'm confused."}
{"text":"\"meh\" is a good way to describe how I feel about Cibo.  The restaurant itself is gorgeous. I loved the decor and even the set up - most of the tables have a good view out the windows for people watching. The bar is really nice as well.
The food was not exciting. I have to say the highlight of the meal was the free fresh baked bread. It had sea salt and rosemary on top and was really tasty.  
The meat and cheese platter was also good, it was a good portion size for the price.
We both ordered fresh house made pasta items.  They were nothing special at all. Not gross, but not exciting. I didn't think the prices were unreasonable, just that the food was little more than decent.  Even the service was just okay.
I wouldn't come back here, except maybe for a drink at the bar since it's a nice venue."}
{"text":"Went there for an office birthday lunch mostly because everything else around was packed and we didn't want to wait. Charcuterie & cheese board was fine, nothing spectacular. Croutons on the caesar salad was a bit stale. I ordered the ravioli on recommendation by someone who's had it previously - terrible choice, perhaps they got a new chef?? The semi-freddo custard dessert was too lemony and strange tasting. Best thing was probably the hazelnut gelato. Worst of all I got food poisoning after. Thanks for ruining my birthday CIBO."}
{"text":"Nice decor and atmosphere, but that's where it ends. The service was iffy. Our cocktails took forever to arrive and were watered down. And the food - supposedly 'fresh made' pasta - tasted like overpriced boxed noodles seasoned with hamburger helper. If you're looking for a big chain experience, there are much better options around. In the mood for Italian? Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"First, the pros: Beautiful restaurant with a big wine selection, and great big windows. The open kitchen is a nice touch. And the $18 prix fixe lunch offered for Summerlicious was reasonable for what you might expect from the Yorkville area.

Unfortunately, the food wasn't anything special. The pasta didn't have a lot of meat in it and the appetizer was also pretty small. The dessert also seemed like it had come fresh out of the fridge. The service was also slower than average, maybe because there are only a limited number of servers for such a big restaurant. They also wouldn't let us substitute a dessert for a tea. 

In conclusion- there are better Italian restaurants if you are looking for a good meal out."}
{"text":"I think the biggest problem with this place is they think that they are the Sh*t and don't feel like they need to improve. The food and the vibe is good. I'm not going to say it's the best thing in the world, it's a nice place for dinner. Super loud so sit close if you want to have some sort of conversation. The menu has a great selection, the service has been good but their hostesses, the dumbest people I've met in the business. BOTH times I've been there, it took, I kid you not, 5 hostesses to figure out our reservation. They ALL asked us if we have a reservation, for what name, for how many people and then made us wait for a table for 20 minutes. I get it, you're young and don't care to be there but at least make an effort.

L'Unita down the street, may be a better choice if you want Italian and don't want to feel like you're in a food court. 
Nice decor though"}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday evening... had made a reservation for 7:30 (which was a very good idea since the restaraunt filled up quickly after 8:00 PM).  Since the weather was so nice, at first we thought we would sit in the outdoor patio area, then decided perhaps the lounge.. and finally settled into the dining area.  The hostess was more then happy to help us select seating even though we changed our minds a few times.. 

The atmosphere and ambiance is wonderful, nice sized rooms, tastefully decorated with just the right amount of lighting - including two private rooms in the back (perfect for a family celebration or even formal meetings).  

The staff appear happy to work in this establishment as we saw them walk to and from the kitchen and bar.

Our server Alison was very refreshing, personable, professional - and very attentative.  She definitely made this dining experience wonderful - so big thank you to you Alison! 

... so now on to the food... hmm... it is Monday morning and thinking of it brings a smile to my face - really was that good and exceeded my expectagions and my the company I was with.  We ordered a few drinks as well as our appetizer - \"Proscitto & Fromaggio\" to share.. nice and hit the palette just fine.  My guest fullyenjoyed their meals - \"Pappardell\" .. lovely pasta, slow cooked lamb stew, etc; Fusilli with chicken, mushroom cream sauce and I had the Linguine with grilled chicken, pesto, pine nuts, etc.... OMG... so very yum.  We also ordered a nice bottle of wine (there are soooo many to select) which was not pricey - Italian Red \"Cesari Mara Valpolicella Ripasso\" which we also very much enjoyed.

A great evening, great experience and a big thank you to the kitchen, staff and of course big kudos to Alison (our server).

Cheers! :-)"}
{"text":"I used to go to CIBO on King west location but tried the Yonge location for a friend birthday.
Don't recommend it at all:( we were group of 9 and reserved table in advanced but they sat us next to exit door and every second staff where going and coming from and opening the door each time made us froze all night; asked the servant to do something as it was really freezing and he said they can't do anything as they are using the door! 
Another disappointing point that my husband chose a 2013 bottle of wine and they silently brought 2014 and when my husband mentioned it to servant he simply said their menu is not updated and should be fixed.. to me it is a rip off to sell 2014 wine with 2014 price...
Overall would say pick other choices if you have other options."}
{"text":"I was at Cibo to celebrate the birthdays to two friends. We were a large group of about 15 people. We were told at the time we made the reservation that due to the size of the party, we would have to have a set menu at $45 per person. There was a mixture of pizzas, arancini, pastas and some other things that I don't even remember because most of it was disappointingly bland.  The food was mostly carbs with little to no protein or vegetables. It was certainly not worth the price.
When it was time to settle the bill, we were informed that they could not do separate bills, and in fact, they wanted one person to pay for the full bill. They also did not make any effort to keep track of the alcohol consumption by person. This would have been helpful to know from the start, but we probably would not have chosen to go there if we had known. 
I've given them one star but only because we were in their private room which was nice. 
I will never go back there and I do not recommend it to anyone."}

I've sent many friends to this place as well, and all have walked away very happy. No complaints here!"}

{"text":"4 stars for ambiance. 1 star for food. I ordered the risotto and got a plate of tasteless brown mush with some garlic and mysterious slightly less mushy lumps. Thankfully I wasn't that hungry or I would have sent it back. I managed to get through about a third of it. I've only sent one meal back in my life before, if that's any indication of what this was like. Any kitchen putting that slop out should be embarrassed."}
{"text":"Went to dinner tonight and found it to be a unique and very rustic feel.

Beautifully decorated with all the hints of what a winme bar should look like, alas the service was just plain amateur.

Maybe it was an off evening but she didn't talk much about the menu or the great wines on the list.
No mention about the menu, she was just plain horrible!  
Never checked on us, to see how our dinner was or offer anything we needed, the one staff just threw my dinner in front of me.  Just plain rude!
She didn't ask for coffee or a look at the deserts or digestiv drinks.

The food was terrific, I just wished the owners realize that your restaurant and food are only as good as your hosts and servers, i can't even give them an outstanding grade for the food that service was just terrible, none of the basics of hospitality were followed.

{"text":"Never coming back here again! Food was mediocre,  service was just ok. They charged us for hot water; one cup for $1, and charged for every refill after that. After we questioned (the tap water policy) Our waitress had the nerve to tell us that most restaurants now charge for hot water. Really??!! We asked for a couple of plates for cupcakes that we brought in to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday and they charged us $3 per person for plating fees.So needless to say, my friends and I will NOT be recommending this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance but a little loud. The service was strong and made for a pleasant experience. 

I had salad and pasta which was good yet unspectacular. 

The dessert/tiramisu was pretty good as well. 

Food - 3.5/5
Ambiance - 4/5
Service - 4.5/5
Price to Value Ratio - 3/5"}
{"text":"I love the French martinis here! Start with a round of them. The pasta is all made to order and is delicious. I enjoy the spicy sausage pasta or the lobster cannelloni. There is a great atmosphere here and I much prefer it to the Yorkville location."}
{"text":"Reviews below are accurate. Food was not bad, but limited variety given 35$ price tag for brunch per person... pricy. Service is terrible through....just deplorable. Can't believe they are surviving on King west with such terrible service. Won't be back for sure! Do not recommend it..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome. Food is great, staff is friendly and helpful. Food and drinks come out quickly so it's a great dining experience. Been to Toronto three years in a row and always go to cibo our first night."}
{"text":"Returned a few days ago for lunch with a friend, and we were both utterly disappointed. The lunch portions were small and expensive, leaving far too much to be desired. Best part of the meal was the coffee at the end that came with a mini biscotti."}
{"text":"Went there for Summerlicious dinner. I felt rushed to order, to eat, etc.. Arugula Portobello was okay, nothing special. Ravioli - was good. Salmon (main dish) was just tasteless, and asparagus was burned. I make better salmon at home. It's an easy fish to make, common! Also, portions were small. Blueberry & Vanilla Panna Cotta was the only dish that we liked. 
Left $70 there, which was not worth it at all.
Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This place is pretty big, so it's quite easy to get a spot.  Had a couple of apps and wine.

So we ordered a rice ball, and it came with some tomato sauce but as the waitress was bringing it to our table, she trips and the tomato sauce goes flying everywhere - including all over my shirt.  Not just a few spots, but huge blobs everywhere.  Anyway, the waitress doesn't even notice and goes back to the kitchen to get some cloths to clean up the floor, all the while I'm here cleaning my shirt with the napkin.  She finally realizes that she got a ton on my shirt and apologizes and asks if she can do anything.  So I ask her if she's got any club soda, to which she replies - \"Do you want me to bring you dish soap?\"  So she goes back to the kitchen bewildered, but she brings another fellow who brought club soda (probably more experienced).  So he keeps asking me is there anything he can do... blah blah blah.  Eventually the manager comes out next and apologizes and tells me he'll cover the dry cleaning bill.  Yeah thanks.... 

Oh and at the end of the night they overcharged us a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or money on this place because all you will get is terrible service (was at the restaurant for 3.5 hours) and a COLD, average-tasting meal."}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious food and amazing decor!
The Caesar Salad and Mushroom risotto to die for!!!"}
{"text":"The food is always delicious at CIBO. The pizzas, the pastas and the fish. We usually go to the other locations. But the service was exceptional at this one. We were a big group but Emily (our server) was awesome. Always smiling and on the ball. I am switching my favourite Italian restaurant to this CIBO location and hope that I get Emily all the time."}
{"text":"For a Wednesday night the place was packed and fun. Great selection of draught beers, and a huge selection of wine that impressed my wife. We shared three appetizers and a pizza. The highlights of the meal were actually the complimentary homemade bread, chili oil, parmesan, olives to start. The appetizers were hot, fresh, and very hearty. Probably what I would describe as high-end home-style. The pancetta pizza was unreal.. highly recommended. 

The price was more than reasonable for what we had: $105 before tax for two, three glasses of wine, two pints, three appetizers and pizza. Will go again!"}
{"text":"My team came here last minute for the $20 lunch special and they were able to accommodate us which was very nice. The special consists of your choice of salad and a main (pasta or pizza). It was a really good deal for what you got and the portions were definitely generous. 

I had the Cesar salad and the Fusilli chicken pasta. The salad was great but the chicken was a bit dry. It was obviously cooked separately and then added to the pasta so it hadn't absorbed any of the (very delicious!) flavour or creaminess of the sauce. That said, I'd definitely like to come back for another lunch or possibly dinner. My only other complaint was that we were a large group but they only brought out one serving a bread at a time. It wasn't even enough to everyone in our group to have a slice. C'mon!"}
{"text":"Classy environment and decor. Wine and food was decent, service was okay, probably would have been better if it wasn't a Friday evening we visited the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is an example of style over substance with the exception of the food, which delivers. It's not so much that anything is lacking in the other areas- wine, service, etc- but the design is pretty much the only thing that delivers immediately and lacks surprise (the disappointing kind, \"I was surprised the wine pour was that of a taste and charged at a glass. As were the mixed drinks) 
The food, lovely. Excellent minestrone and salads. Bread and flavored evoo an excellent start to the meal. And then right about the time we ordered the entree, it began to unravel. I made what I believed to be a fairly inoffensive request for a side of vegetables, whatever the kitchen had prepared, along with my entree. Denied. Our server informed us that the kitchen would be upset if she asks for anything like a side. I thought perhaps she misunderstood so I confirmed I wanted to add it, not substitute anything, and still no. I wanted to call my mom because this was the first time I've ever been told I cannot eat my vegetables. 
It wasn't overly busy making my request out of place, they just really said no. And when my husband asked for the polenta to be left off the plate- and not for anything in its place- the response was that she would as if the kitchen would do that. 
Now maybe the kitchen would say \"hey, sold as is\" or \"you've got us all wrong\" but the issue remains as the service directly presented this attitude as that of the kitchen. And without a nice pour of wine and a reasonable cocktail prior to all this, I was in no mood to find it entertaining."}
{"text":"Good service, nice atmosphere, these are the only reasons this place gets 2 stars. The food severely lacks flavor."}
{"text":"If you want a perfect night out at an upscale restaurant, this is it. I had my birthday dinner here for the first time and was stunned by the service here. Everyone is super friendly and the restaurant is so beautiful. We received and ate our appetizers and main meal within one hour. Aside from their amazing service and decor, the food is super delicious. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We stopped by here and were rewarded. The ambiance, service and food were all good. They have a good wine list including a number by the glass. They also have a great happy hour where some of  the wines are half price. I had the lamb ragu papardelle and it was delicious. The lamb had a bit too much fat on it (poorly trimmed) and it was a little tough but this is really being picky. I'd definitely go back. Good food, good service and reasonable prices. A winning combination."}
{"text":"The decor at King St w n yorkville is classy. It is crowded but nice overall feel. But the food is OKAY, desserts are not good. 
We sat at the bar once for drinks n desserts, cocktails are definitely better than some of TOs places where they make slushy cocktails, so thats why Cibo gets 3 star from me."}
{"text":"Very good food. Good service. Our server Oskar was very helpful with his recommendations. All food items were tasty and had a different take on the taste. We'll keep going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"As expected, it was similar to the downtown older sister, and the former Ciao. Seared tuna and pizza were cooked perfectly. However, the salad with mushrooms left little to be desired. Easily could of elevated the dish by serving the mushrooms warm. The tiramisu to finish off the meal was most certainly the highlight and exclamation point at the end of the story. 


Seating was great, however tables were squeezed a bit close together.  The kid's highchair beside us kept knocking into my elbow. It was also difficult to converse at times due to the roaring voices echoing throughout the space.

Overall great meal and ambience. Appreciated the open kitchen that offered transparency and insight into the food we indulged in."}
{"text":"I went there with my husband on a Friday nite. it was kind of a busy night, yet the service was still good.

We ordered a salad, a pizza, and linguine with clams / mussels / tiger shrimp. My husband had a red wine, while I had a prosecco.  

The cocktail selection looked great. My husband had a good red wine too.  Well, after all, its a wine bar. 

Anyway, the food was just mediocre. The waitress got two of the our items wrong. We didn't bother to change them.  I would say this place is overpriced for the food they are serving.  

One odd thing is that when I asked for a spoon so I could eat the linguine with fork and spoon, she gave me a dessert spoon.  :/

Sorry to say but there are many italian restaurants at the same price range and serve better food."}
{"text":"This place in in my neighbourhood and I've been there several times for lunch and dinner. I have enjoyed the food each time: pappardelle with lamb ragu is very hearty and tasty; grilled calamari  was perfectly done and big enough for a small meal even though listed as an antipasto, the ahi tuna with the eggplant caponata was excellent (another reviewer commented that the caponata was too salty, but I didn't find it so), the burrata with prosciutto was excellent and also a very large antipasto portion, and the radicchio and endive salad with cambazola was very tasty and large enough to share if you're each having a pasta dish. I found the linguine with clams in white sauce to be a bit uninspiring, the pasta was not one of their house-made ones so not of the same quality, and the sauce seemed a bit bland. The gelato was also disappointing, it comes only as a plate with three large scoops of different flavours (which was more than I wanted): the hazelnut was excellent, the pistachio was bland, and the lemon was really good but did not pair well with the other two because it was so tart.

Wine selection by the glass or bottle is good, although a 5 oz pour is a bit small for the price as another reviewer pointed out. There are a number of reasonably-priced bottles.

The space itself is lovely, and quite different depending on where you're sitting: like a stone wine cellar at the back, a modern bar in the centre, street-side cafe along the windows, and a patio that blocks some of the King Street noise with glass panels.

The service has been very good with one exception: one evening, our server almost completely ignored us, and service was extremely slow. The other times, quite prompt and friendly. They offer sharing plates for any of the dishes that you want to split, usually without having to ask."}
{"text":"Cibo Wine Bar is a sister restaurant to Yorkville's Ciao Wine Bar by Liberty Group. Both Cibo and Ciao offer the same menu by Chef Saverio Macri, an authentic rustic Italian and exudes a very trendy and chic vibe that many nightlife venues by the Liberty Group signifies. I have always been a fan of the food and ambiance of Ciao Wine Bar, so I took the advantage duing Winterlicious to try the spot on King West.

 At first glance, Cibo Wine Bar is much larger and open concept than its sister Ciao Wine Bar.  The beautifully furnished space features an open kitchen, where you can witness fresh pasta being made and a a glass wine room.  That's not all! What caught my eye in the dining area is the stone walls and exposed brick... so much character and warmth!

 Tiger Shrimp with spicy wine garlic tomato sauce featured four pieces of tiger shrimps. The sauce was delicious on its own, nevermind the shrimp, so we used some to dip our breads into.

 Baked Eggplant with melted boccoccini and parmigiano and light tomato sauce was also a very generous portion of an appetizer.  The layers of cheese and eggplant was great but I found that it got a bit mushy and fell apart midway.

 Arugula & Prosciutto Di Parma with shaved parmigiano reggiano, red wine vinegar and extra-virgin olive oil offered us a lighter choice from the other two apps.  I personally enjoyed the prosciutto pieces with my arugula for the texture variances.  Can't get enough!

 Diavola Pizza with tomato, mozzarella, spicy calabrese salami and roasted red peppers is perfect for sharing! The spicy salami gave this pizza a little fiery kick, which we all loved.  It was very enjoyable.

 Next was the Tagliatelle with porcini mushrooms in a light cream sauce.  I love mushrooms and i love cream sauce so this was an obvious hit with me.  There was a good pasta to sauce ratio and the texture of the mushroom was good - not soggy at all.

 We also got the Chianti Braised Short Ribs with creamy Gorgonzola polenta and crispy onions.  Having a piece of the fall-off-the-bone rib with the polenta and crispy onions in one bite excited my taste buds from the different textures.  I definitely fell in love with the Gorgonzola polenta and the crispy onions.

 Vanilla Bean Panna Cotta with candied blood orange and tangerine was my favourite dessert from the three we ordered.  It was of good consistency and had a nice jiggle to it.  

 The Tiramisu Martini was also a hit at our table. A scoop of the different layers was sweet and delectable. 

 Dark Chocolate Risotto Pudding with hazelnut brittle on the other hand was the richer and heavier dessert choice.  Loved that it had dark chocolate with fresh berries as well.  This is my first time having risotto pudding and I quite enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Not worth the money. Mediocre Italian food at best, outdated dishes (I.e. Polenta Fries) Very expensive for what you get. I got the octopus and it was overcharged on the outside, tasted burnt and not in a good way. In fact the burnt taste was the only taste it had... I had to add spicy peppers for some (ANY) flavour and two small pieces if octopus was $18. Severely disappointed. As an Italian this place is comparable in food to that of the Olive Garden with much higher prices. Only good \"Italian\" food for those who don't know Italian food. The Penne Arrabita was served with a roasted red (sweet) pepper - the dish ARRABIATA is Spicy , why serve it with a sweet roasted red pepper?!? For the same money I'd go to Marinella's on College street. No I am not affiliated with them! Will not ever return."}
{"text":"The Cibo Wine Bar just added a location at 2472 Yonge St. in uptown Toronto and I'm very impressed. I've never been to one of their restaurants and I found that the decor to be absolutely beautiful and the food delicious. I'm tempted to give this 4 1/2 stars simply because of the greeter. She didn't acknowledge us on our way in - she was busy on the phone and it took three attempts to get her attention long enough to ask her if they were open. It was just after 4 PM and we weren't sure if they were receiving guests. However, our server Christian made up for that as did the amazing food. My guest and I  shared a marvellous stone baked pizza. One of the best I've had. The price was reasonable, the ambience wonderful and I highly  recommend this restaurant. I'm sure to return."}
{"text":"Brunch Groupon $35/2pp on a Sunday .

This place has great potential, given the ambiance and atmosphere, however there are several flaws that have left patrons on the fence about returning. Definitely NOT worth the full price. 

Food: great selection of stations - fresh fruits, rolls/croissants, antipasti, cheeses/meats, personally crafted wood oven pizzas, omelettes, Belgium waffles, tossed salads, pastas, dessert table/stuffed mini cannellonis + !
-they didn't serve fresh berries with the waffles as a topping choice and when I asked they said they didn't have any....oh please, you had a bowl of strawberries at the fruit station that was never replenished either 
-the carving station was a SUPER FAIL, the \"worker/chef\" was bored out of his mind and left station empty 85% of the time, the meat did not look appetizing it was dry. The whole set up was a disaster with the wiring and all. some patrons had to slice at the meat themselves because there was no one servicing the station
-cannellonis had only 1 filling which was an orangey flavoured ricotta, you should at least have just a plain??

Service: Plates were removed in a timely fashion 100% of the time. The wait staff all look dazed and slow, and lacked character. We were NOT allowed to substitute the Groupon included Prosseco for a non-alcoholic beverage: tonic water and OJ??. Our waiter did not greet us generously or in a timely manner and did not give us a run down of the stations and what they had to offer - perhaps if the waiter is busy at the moment the hostess could assume this task. The 2 hostesses were also sleepy and boring and did not greet us at the door with enthusiasm. I had to ask for a top off for my coffee 5x, not once did she come around and offer on her own. One waitstaff, was wearing a NIGHTGOWN, it was see through with lace, satin, chest exposed and she kept having to cover herself with her cardigan and she walked down the restaurant everytime. INAPPROPRIATE. everyone else wore a restaurant uniform polo and was modestly cladded. When we left the hostess did not even say bye.

Cooks/Chefs: extremely nice and pleasant ! accommodated to my egg white omelette 

Venue: the basement where the restroom is located is like a morgue, F R E E Z I N G, most uncomfortable experience, I didn't want to drop my pants.

Overall: lots of room for improvement, add some live jazz, and replace your sleepy hungover unexperienced unprofessional waitstaff/hostesses"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try it here. The appetizers were tasty especially the cheese and meat platter. Wine was great too. However I ordered seafood pasta as main dish, which is a bit salty. Overall the atmosphere was very relaxing here!"}
{"text":"I came to Cibo with a group of friends for the 2018 Winterlicious. It left much to be desired. I have been to the King Street location previously and really enjoyed the food, as well as the service. This time around, both the food and the service were mediocre. I'm not sure whether the Winterlicious menu was purposely lowered in quality to justify the price. The portions were much smaller and the taste was just okay. I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Gorgeous space! Wine enthusiasts this is the place to visit. Service was amazing from the moment we arrived. Server was very knowledgable with the menu and flexible with substitutions. 

My friends and I ordered two bottles for the table and ordered our mains right away. Complimentary warm bread served with a side of olives. Opted for the freshly made in house pasta which you can sub any dish for an extra $1. Everyone ordered pasta- solid. I ordered the seafood option (tiger shrimp, clams, calamari) in a tomato sauce. Fresh, light, and balanced with not too much sauce and generous portions.

Half price bottles on Thursdays! Need I say more?

Perfect spot for a night out with friends, date night or simply bumping into interesting characters. The ladies of The Social were seated right across from us. Intrigue and drama is all I'll say..."}
{"text":"Food was very good here, hand made pasta and pizza and all very classic Italian flavours. I love that you get some bread on the table to start as not many places do that anymore, making it a go to for me. I personally got the PAPPARDELLE which was a very nice meal, the lamb wasn't over powering and the meal was just the right size. They have a very good wine list with lots to choose from. As for the service it could have been better, our server in particular had some attitude towards the table and didn't come by often causing us to ask to be severed. When it came to the bills we were told they couldn't be separated which seemed very odd for a restaurant to not be able to do. 
All in all, the service wasn't very good but the food is. It's a nice place to go with friends or on a date and other tables seemed to have much better service."}
{"text":"Great experience. 

We went for the Sunday brunch buffet.  There is a bit of a wait to get in even if you have a reservation.  A small beach or cordoned off area for waiting would be nice as things seemed a bit disorganized there, but the wait was about 15 mins and I wasn't in a  hurry so we weren't upset by that.  

The food was great - especially the pizza. So many options. Our server was fantastic. Cooks were friendly and helpful.  Hostesses were distant but not rude.  It was without a doubt busy, but I guess the above reasons are why. I would absolutely come back for brunch or evening drinks if this is what I can come to expect.

Oh - note to all Buffet eaters:
Please stay classy.  Leave the Tupperware at home...."}

{"text":"I usually get the grilled calamari which doesn't disappoint but we decided to share the mushroom risotto My new favourite."}
{"text":"Extremely and very pleasantly surprised!

Made a reservation a few weeks ago to go to Cibo with my two friends. An hour before we were supposed to go I started reading reviews and they were very dismal. Major complaints about service and, to a lesser extent, the food. We almost didn't go but decided to try it anyway. 

Right away you could see how on point the service in fact was. The hostess sat us quickly. And our server (who's name unfortunately I don't remember) was excellent. Drinks came quickly, water was always refilled. I saw the two managers out on the floor helping out and keeping a very watchful eye on everything. 

The food was delicious! I had a arugula salad with Parmesan and when I asked for some more from the food runner I got a generous portion in seconds. For my main I had the lamb ragu with gluten free penne. First of all, I would never have known it was GF if you didn't tell me. But it was one of the best pasta dishes I've had in recent memory. (Though I did add hot peppers to give it a bit more kick.) My friends loved their apps and their pizza and gnocchi. 

We were raving to our server and telling her how great everything was. And the next thing you know they brought us a dessert on the house! I couldn't eat it so I ordered the semifredo and polished it off - it was delicious!

I hope they can keep up whatever they were doing because it was a fantastic experience and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great, however I gave it 2 stars due to the food. I think it's a little over priced for its quality. The beef/ tuna capriccio was tasteless, risotto wasn't cooked long enough and the clam pasta with white wine had so much rocks/ sand in the clam it totally ruined my experience"}
{"text":"Cibo wine bar is a new spot on the King West strip.  The space is open and inviting; you will see the oodles of wine bottles they have on display when you enter.

It is a great spot for drinks after work; they have quite a wine selection and have some neat cocktails on their drink menu.  

I have tried their Burrata but compared to the other Burrata in the city, I would rate it an a-ok - nothing special.  The Burrata board with the accouterments and meats it comes with is great though; perfect for sharing.

Service is quick and the wait staff are attentive.

I would love to come back and try out their dinner/lunch menu options."}
{"text":"This place is...okay. I've been here for Sunday brunch 3 times. Twice as a group of 4 and once as a couple. I'll start by saying it's definitely not worth $35/person. If you get a groupon or some other good deal, it's ok. The food here is mediocre and the coffees are SO SMALL. They make the tiniest lattes I've ever seen. The desserts are all store-bought. The pizza is decent but nothing special, same with the pasta. There's one salad option and it's just spring mix. 2 types of meats available - lamb and beef - at the carving station. Unfortunately, they were both really cold. 
Most of the food was kind of cold by the time you got your plate to the table, which made it a lot less enjoyable. The interior is pretty nice."}
{"text":"I went for a birthday drinks & dessert after dinner on Wednesday night around 9pm. High ceiling, lots of tables, very spacious. Because the restaurant was pretty empty we were able to choose our table. 

Didn't really look at the food menu, just went straight for a bottle of rose wine and Nutella pizza ($12)! The pizza was very big and delicious. They could've been a little bit more generous with the banana since it looked like they used half of it for the whole pizza. The crust was tasteless so my boyfriend got some balsamic to use as a dip (smart).

Service was good, nothing exceptional. The waitress entered the wrong wine for the bill, but she was quick to fix it once we pointed it out."}
{"text":"I bought groupon voucher for brucnh at cibo for 32$.The original price is around 70$(pricey for what they offer).
Decoration is great but brunch was not what i expected.
It is worth to give it a try though."}
{"text":"Beautiful design for the restaurant. A little overpriced, but the pasta was fresh and had good flavor, but the staff was the rudest team I have ever encountered. It gave me a horrible outlook on Canada and specifically the people in Toronto. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Don't quote me on this but I do have relative high standard in Italian food. Honestly, the winterlicious menu has not surprised me as much I hope. I ordered the grill octopus, which was a bit hard to chew and dry. I went with the trout dish for secondi, which was kind of normal/not wowing :-/ however, I love the dessert (I got the home made gelato, 5 stars quality though). On average, I will rank the food 3.5 star. 

However, this place got a impressive drink menu, great ambiance, beautiful deco. I would recommend coming for a drink rather than dinner, if you really care about whether the food is going to wow you or not. But, I have to say that it is indeed a not bad place overall!"}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday and the food was amazing . Their selection of wine is on point and the servers know about their food and wine. The fungi us definitely to die for. !!!! Highly recommend this place.  Atmosphere is also nice and classy .  You can come here dressed fresh casual or dressed up a bit . Summer time their patio opens and it's pretty refreshing sitting out there."}
{"text":"Uptown Italian eatery. The appetizer were good not great. Had the calamari (grilled) and the mushrooms. Mushrooms were tasty and warm and the portion size was good. Can't understand why we were not served the fresh warm bread? Everyone looked like they enjoyed it. The ahi tuna was extremely \"fishy\" tasting; I wasn't a big fan of it. I would probably go back but am not killing myself to get there."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday had a few sangrias and chicken linguini in a pesto cream sauce. The pasta was amazing, I don't remember the last time I had such great pasta. The pesto was so fresh, and chicken was well flavoured. My friends had the chicken Parmesan and seafood pasta, which they both loved as well. The desserts were good, I can't recall the exact names but it was delicious not too sweet. Only minor compliant is that server could have been more intuitive as food, dessert and bill took a while to come out and they weren't busy at that time. I will definitely go back again and would love to try the salmon pizza."}
{"text":"Had a very disappointing dinner here Saturday night. 

We were six adults out for a birthday dinner.  The atmosphere was loud and friendly. Our service was very slow but we weren't in a hurry as we were partying but it soon became clear that tables that arrived after us were being served before us and actually finished, paid and left before us. 

The pasta dishes we ordered were totally unsatisfactory. The gnocchi was small and hard, - not light and fluffy. The waitress explained that it was because the gnocchi was potato based. Isn't that what gnocchi is?  By definition?  And light and fluffy is how they should be.  The Gorgonzola sauce was gloppy and anything but generous. Hardly enough to moisten the gnocchi. I had to request some parmigiana cheese to add some flavour to the dish. The seafood penne was supposed to have a white wine sauce but it was served dry and not hot. The pasta seemed to have been boiled and left on the counter for 20 minutes before serving as it was dry (not enough sauce) and flavourless. 

The manager listened to our complaints and kindly offered to comp one of our two bottles of wine and brought us a free tray of desserts. They were so bad we actually left them without finishing them. And my wife would normally NEVER leave chocolate on the table.  In this case we left the chocolate ball (no chocolate flavour), the panacotta (too much gelatine) and the cheesecake (totally dry and not creamy) - horrible stuff. 

Separately, the ladies room had no toilet paper in one of the stalls which was pointed out to the staff.  Later in the evening during a subsequent visit to the ladies room there was still no toilet paper in the stall. Similarly, the men's room was very dirty with water splashed everywhere and dirty floors.  This should have been our warning before we began. 

We will never go back."}
{"text":"I've been here on multiple occasions! Have tried quite a few things but my favourite is the meat platter, literally get it every time it's so delicious!
However the gnocchi with white sauce recommended by the waitress tasted like putrid cheese. Not a fan of that one ! 
Other than that, one of my top Toronto restaurants !
Complimentary bread is also a plus !"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and amazing service......than the pizza arrived.
Dry pizza with too much of a chew, a few toppings in the middle of the pizza but I believe the chef forgot about adding the rest.
Two of us had pizza at the table both of us with the same complaint......our other buddy got Lobster Ravioli...he was happy.
Cocktails were good and polenta fries were nice as well."}
{"text":"It feels like a classy but warm Italian resto.  When it gets busy during dinner service it can get loud so you end up needing to get close to your company if you want to hear them. But then again this is a good tactic for dates :p

Their wine selection is AMAZING! But it can also get overwhelming so talk to your sever and tell them what you're feeling like and what you might eat and they'll tell you some options. Ours helped us decide on the Malbec. Yummy!

I'm always a fan of restos that still serve you comp bread. Even more impressed when it's yummy and served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar like this place!

We started with the polenta fries. Who thought of this cause it was sooooo good! I especially loved the dipping sauces that complimented the fried polenta so well!

I'm not usually and pasta fan but when in Rome...! I got the pasta with the rose sauce and pancetta. Simple but sooooo tasty! That's pasta for ya- to the point and simple ingredients but when done right it's so delicious! 

I'll come back again  for sure!"}
{"text":"Our family had booked a birthday dinner at the king street location and from the mixed reviews I was undecided on whether to be excited or not. 

     My girlfriend and I were the first of our party to arrive and the hostess looked quite disinterested in her job; not a good start. We were seated and things started to roll nicely after that. We were served some drinks while we waited and were given fresh bread and olives that was quite delicious. 

     Once the rest of our party arrived, the service took a turn for the worst. Drink orders were quite simply forgotten, our server disappeared for eternities at a time and our dinner became a lengthy battle of attrition. 

     The positive was that the food was delicious. Seafood fettucine, penne alla vodka, the pizzas and the appetisers were all tasty when they got there. 

Overall I don't imagine I will be personally booking any future dinners here as I know there are better places for Italian in the city with much better service."}
{"text":"I only have one small complaint about this place (which I'll get to later) but other than that, it was perfect! Its in a great location with lots of other amazing restaurants close by but it sticks out among the best in the area. It's also super easy to get to on the trolley car. But if you drive, there is valet parking around the corner. I think it was $15, which isn't bad for the area.  

The décor is so nice! It would be the perfect place for a date or a special occasion. I went in a group, which was good but it was a little difficult to talk because it gets pretty loud. They have these adorable booths in the back that were perfect for our group... which brings me to my complaint, which is that when we got the reservations and asked for the booths in the back, they gave us kind of a hard time about it, despite the fact that they sat empty the whole night. But, no biggy, we got the booth and were happy. 

Food was amazing! The thing that sticks out the most is the polenta fries. It was the first time I actually had polenta and I loved it! But everything was great! Since we were a big group I got to taste a bunch of different things. I got the branzino, which was perfect. The pizza was really good to... but I'm glad I asked for crispy because otherwise I'm afraid it would have been to soft. I'm not a fan of tomato sauces, but the people in our group that are loved the pastas. The old fashion was great too!

Lastly, they have private rooms, that I think fit around 15 to maybe 25 or 30 people. Perfect for special occasions! They look like little caves!"}
{"text":"Really poor quality food at their weekend brunch buffet. The octopus was mushy and smelly, there were only a handful of gluten free options, the dessert bar never seemed to have fresh fruit replenished and the cakes looked like they were an homage to an airport hotel dinner buffet. At $35 plus tip, I couldn't find one item that was actually a pleasure to eat. I just ended up having marinated mushrooms and eggplant on my plate, most of which I left for the waitress to take away by the end. The omelette bar was the only redeeming part of the experience."}
{"text":"I generally like Cibo, it's affordable (for the area), centrally located in bustling King St. W; portions are large and the food is tasty.

What I don't like, however is the front hostess', on many occasions they have been rude or have not seated me at my reservation time.  They quote a 1 hr wait when you're the only person waiting on a table.  And worst, I have seen them sit a walk-in table while I was waiting for a table I reserved in advance! You can clearly tell the staff inside the restaurant don't cooperate well with the front-end staff (and probably for good reasons).  Thank goodness talking to the hostess is only a small portion of the dining experience.

But if you get past the hostess' the experience inside the restaurant is actually good, the wait staff is polite and knowledgeable about the menu, the bartenders are attentive and the food is sure to please."}
{"text":"Sorry Cibo. Had a really bad summerlicious experience here. All 3 of us ordered most things across the menu and it was so disappointing! My main was so bland I salted it up which is something I'd never do! 

Just when we thought it couldn't get any worse we were brought out some horrible desserts! The gelato was icy... A terrible tart worse than day old from the grocery store... And some sort of layered parfait dessert that tasted line yogurt (not Italian at all) and wouldn't hold a candle to McD's fruit n yogurt parfait. 

I've been here for regular menu and we loved it, but this time we had a rude awakening. 

Don't get summerlicious! I used to love this place. If I come back I hope to write a 5 star review next time."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner at Cibo last night. The restaurant is huge but still has a cozy, modern vibe to it. Service was friendly, prompt and attentive. I felt the prices were reasonable; most mains were around $20 and the house wine only $7. 

The complimentary bread and olives was a nice touch however, both were so salty it made my eyes water. 

My husband got the carbonara and upgraded it to the fresh, house made pasta. Well worth the extra $2.

I had the lobster canelloni. Amazing.

For dessert we had lemon ricotta cheesecake, which was probably the creamiest cheesecake I've had in a long time, and a latte. 

There were a lot of other items on the menu that looked interesting so we will most likely visit again."}
{"text":"Solid Sunday brunch buffet. Trendy yet comfortable atmosphere. Satisfying selection including: fruit/bread/pastry table, antipasto table, spicy chorizo, bacon, and bfast potatoes, omelette station, waffle station, cured meats, smoked salmon, green salads with cold seafood, pizza station (+hot items like arancini, etc), hot carving station, and dessert table.

BONUS: Half price bubbles w/ Sunday brunch!  They offer a list of Italian, French & Canadian bubbles. Highly recommend ordering a bottle of \"Les Étoiles\" by Hinterland fr Prince Edward County (dry & delicate; $45 Sunday price)

AND they have coat check!

Would definitely brunch here again. Found this place through Groupon but website lists regular price for brunch as $35pp so estimate total meal at regular price would be ~$150 for 2ppl (incl. brunch, bubbles, coffee, taxes & tip)"}
{"text":"Really great vibe, spacious venue, great for large groups, good private rooms, sexy vibe, good date place, portions are fair to big. What I ordered: Arancini to share and Porcini Mushroom Tagliatelle. Arancini was good. Not the best I've had but good. Tagliatelle was really yum! Freshly handmade pasta, great light creamy sauce but not overwhelming, the aroma of truffle oil once the dish landed in front of me was enough to get me excited, not too heavy. 3.5 stars because service was not superb: freshly ground pepper wasn't offered, our waiter wasn't super attentive."}
{"text":"I adore this place. The food is wonderful and the ambiance is a good blend of urban and intimate. I've been to both their Miami locations and their Toronto locations and they seem to deliver consistently across the board. You really can't go wrong with Cibo - unless you dislike Italian food and wine, but even that's a stretch!"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed. Food just ok, service ok (no cutlery until we told them, we had to ask for the napkins...). On top of that, there was water from the AC dripping on our table.
Beautiful place but poor food. There are better options in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner at 930pm. Great ambiance and has a more high end feel since it is in Yorkville. The bread given at the beginning was a little stale. The seafood risotto was a tad salty. The spaghetti and meatballs was the saving grace.  It is quite spicy so watch out if you decide to order it."}
{"text":"Intro:

This place has a nice, sophisticated vibe. I loved the woodsy tones, brick-exposed walls, and candle-light lighting that puts a glow on everyone's face! My girlfriends commented that the spacing was done very nicely; Large and airy, but still had a very intimate feel. We had a corner table which was great for catching up (we didn't have to yell and bark at each other just to be heard), yet we still felt a part of the larger restaurant. 

Food:

I thought I knew I my Italian Food, but I learned something new this night. Our waitress described CIBO cuisine as food from Rome, which essentially means it's a mix of cuisines from different regions around Italy. CIBO is not Terroni, which serves Southern Italian Food (good to know!)

FYI! This restaurant has BIG plates. You might think that King West restaurants have big prices and small plates, but CIBO aims to please you on portion size. 

For appetizers, I had a lovely Spinach Salad with Figs and for my main, I had the Breaded Veal. WARNING! THE BREADED VEAL IS HUGE! My two girlfriends ordered dainty dishes for their mains (one had grilled calamari and she said it was very good; the other had grilled octopus which was also very delish). For me though, this guy brought out a plate the size of a Hummer Tire and the Veal was equally gigantic. 

But was it good? OH MY YES! The breaded crust was done just right and to my shame and horror, I ate half my ginormous Veal in a flash, leaving the smaller half to pack. The dish also came with yummy, buttered potatos which I devoured as well *shame*

So, my reco would be to share the Veal (it becomes a perfect size for two people), or for one, you can just take the rest home for another meal. Cold, breaded, veal is actually very yummy and I paired mine with a Salad for my lunch the next day.

Booze:

 Our waitress mentioned that CIBO has over 2500 bottles of wine, so Oenophiles, drink to your hearts content. Glass selections for Reds are much better than Whites. I splurged and had a glass of an Amarone at $22 for 5 oz. After that, I decided to share a bottle of the San Paolo Rubio, as I needed money to eat... One of my girlfriends also ordered the Italian Mojito; So good, she ordered two more.

Overall, this is a great place. Reading some of the initial reviews on Yelp, I was apprehensive (snobby, bad service, etc...) But I'm glad to report that my experience was great. Our waitress was really lovely and offered great suggestions. She was so smiley too. 

I would recommend this place for date night (it has a nice, sophisticated vibe, but not clubby) or for large groups. At the end of the day, this place was unpretentious and the food was delish."}
{"text":"Brunch at CIBO was just great! I made a reservation on OpenTable a few days before for Sunday at 1:30 pm. We were early finishing in some things that morning so headed to Y&E around 12:15 pm. We explained to the hostess that we were early for the reso and if they can squeeze us in now and she was happy to obliged. It was busy and lots of people walking around. 
As we were taken to our table on the 2nd floor, the hostess told us about all the food stations which are spread out across the restaurant.
There was a fruits, yogurt, cheeses, cured meats, made to order pizza, raw station with salmon and tuna, pasta station, made to order omelettes, bacon and hashed potatoes and dessert. Lots to choose from! 
We got a groupon so $35 for two and included two mimosas. Regular is $35 per person.
It's lots of good and we thought everything was delicious for an all you can eat italian restaurant. I especially enjoyed the pizza and the raw bar. The cannolis were also very good but it was hard to enjoy dessert cause we were stuffed. We tried every station except the pasta. 
I loved the decor with the bricks and exposed piping. 
The wait staff was very attentive for the amount of customers there and the tight space to work in.
 I don't know what everyone else's beef is with this place but we enjoyed our brunch there!"}
{"text":"We went for a Sunday brunch for my girlfriends birthday and it was nice.

we had a private room, so we were able to keep our conversation between us.

the lighting was a little dim but it was a nice intimate setting.

the food was Buffet style with fresh stations everywhere. it would have been nice if they had signs with what everything was. Especially what the different types of meats were. it was upsetting not to get a straight answer from people because they didn't know. 

getting our bill paid what's a little chaotic as they only do one bill, but other than that it was good! 

the fresh waffles were delicious, and so was the pasta and mussels, I enjoyed my experience."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best Italian restaurants you'll find at yonge and eglinton. There's a very lively atmosphere, a whole wall of beer on tap and other fine drinks and some of the best grilled calamari I've ever had. The sea bass I had was a little overcooked, but overall it was a very delicious piece of fish. It's also very easy to get a table for a family of 3 without a reservation. I give this place 4 stars. Would've given it 5 but their debit machine hardly worked and it took a very long time to pay by card. Server was very helpful and friendly about it though."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night.  Always a pleasure.  Our waitress was exceptional.  Great service and food!!"}
{"text":"I ate dinner here in the private room downstairs after a wedding rehearsal dinner. We were served family style with a range of antipasti, pasta and dessert. Everything was absolutely phenomenal including the service. The group was quite large and the servers made sure to reassure us that food was on its way, which was really great. 

The orrechiette pasta with sausage and rapini was undoubtedly the BEST plate of pasta I've had at a restaurant in a while. Because it was family style, I gravitated toward that dish the most. The gnocchi, the polenta fries, the arancini - it was all spectacular. I am second generation Italian spoiled with the cooking of my Italian grandmothers and mother, so when it tastes like home, it's definitely a good sign!

I did not have this experience at the King West location, so I completely wrote Cibo off for a while. I'm so glad I visited the Yorkville location. I will definitely be back and highly recommend you to try it!"}
{"text":"Letzte Station unserer Reise durch den Osten Kanadas ist Toronto. Wir waren auf der Suche nach einem italienischen Restaurant und sind hier gelandet. 
Wir hatten Glück, dass wir um 18:00 Uhr an einem Donnerstag noch einen Tisch ohne Reservierung bekommen haben.

Um es auf den Punkt zu bringen:ein sehr gutes Restaurant. Sehr freundlicher Service, eine angemessene Karte mit vernünftigen Preisen und Speisen in sehr guter Qualität.

Dazu eine tolle Atmosphäre. Ein fantastisches Restaurant. Weiter so!"}
{"text":"Did the buffet brunch on a Saturday.  Really disappointing.  When you walk in, the design & ambience feels like something out of Manhattan but the food quality, service, and scene (basically everything else) just falls short.  The only saving grace was the pizza bar where you can craft your own thin crust pie but I found everything else to be bland-ish.  For $35 a person, I was hoping for higher quality selections but the meats, aranchini, meatballs, dessert tray, croissants, and everything thing else I tried...you name it...to be average to slightly mediocre in quality.  This feels more like a \"scene\" spot but not so much a real foodie haven."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and service for a weeknight. Our server was lovely and helped us navigate their menu. However there were misses with the food. 

We started with the polenta fries which were perfectly crispy but severely lacked salt. If either one of the two dipping sauces had a more pronounced flavour it wouldn't have been as bad. I ended up eating the complimentary olives with the fries to balance the flavours out.

My friend ordered the radicchio and endive salad with sweet gorgonzola and it was surprisingly good! If I ever go back to cibo I would definitely recommend this dish.

I had the lamb ragu with the gluten free penne. The sauce may have been overly reduced leaving it super salty. The dish was topped off with sandwich style slices of cheese which was a bit odd.

The chocolate praline bombe is something that should be shared unless one is looking for self-indulgence. The dessert may have been sitting out for a while as the candied nuts on top were slightly soggy and torte layer at the bottom could have had more crunch."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5 

I like the decor and ambiance of the restaurant.
We had a big group of 8 and the service was pretty accommodating.

They have a wide variety of pizzas and pastas. I had the fettuccine with shrimp which I really liked. The sauce was super flavourful and I really liked their home made pasta. I also tried my friends seafood risotto, and found it pretty bland though. 

Overall it wasn't bad, but it's not something I would want regularly. 

( someone in my table loveddddd their bread though...and kept asking for more, if that helps..)"}
{"text":"I went to Cibo last night for dinner with my friends and we were really excited for some good Italian food especially since the restaurant renovated recently and because we love going out in Yorkville. To put it nicely: our expectations were not met. 

Our hostess was a bit rude and kept rushing us. We had to ask her to bring the complimentary bread out several times. 

My friend and I got the seafood linguine while our other friends got the seafood fettuccine and the carbonara. As for the seafood linguine, I felt that the whole dish was rather bland, I couldn't even taste the salt so you can imagine how much the other spices were lacking. My friend said the carbonara was greasy while our other friend said the seafood fettuccine was bland as well. 

The best part about our experience was the happy hour special where we got half priced wine bottles from 6-7pm."}
{"text":"Love the food and the wine. Very friendly staff. Beautiful atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you're really into super salty food, this is your place. We ordered four dishes and they were all so so so salty. Even the bread was super salty! The dishes themselves were good, but would be better without the excessive salt. My table drank so many glasses of water.

We ordered:
1. Fried calamari: pretty average, good texture.
2. Di Nicolini pizza: this one was actually my favourite out of all the dishes. It had prosciutto and arugula, which is pretty much my go-to pizza. But super salty!
3. Rigatoni with italian sausage, mushroom, ricotta and tomato sauce: again super salty, and the italian sausage wasn't that great either in my opinion. It was really crumbly so it was more like a bolognese sauce.
4. Risotto with clams, mussels, calamari and tiger shrimp: this one came in a red sauce, which I've never had before because it goes better with the seafood. The taste was good (also salty), but I think I prefer white sauce with risotto because the red sauce makes it really watery. 

I guess I would still give this place another chance, since the flavours were good. Maybe the chef was just having an off day."}
{"text":"Gave this place another try after a terrible experience here. 

The food was somehow even more disappointing the second time around. At my first experience here, and in my first review, my food was ridiculously bland. 
This second time around, I ordered a Caesar, the bruschetta and the lobster ravioli.

Caesar was good. No complaints.

The bruschetta was fine. Could have been much better. I ended up drizzling my own oil and vinegar over it which helped moisten the bread and add flavour. 

The lobster ravioli was probably the worst dish I have ever been served at a restaurant. If you've ever been snorkelling or swimming in the ocean, and accidentally swallowed a mouthful of salty ocean water... that's what the ravioli's cream sauce tasted like. A mouth full of ocean water. Couldn't even finish/stomach my dish. 

Take my money and serve me terrible food once, shame on you. 
Twice? Shame on me. 

Lesson learned. Never going back."}
{"text":"Really good food. This restaurant is great for a date night I wouldn't recommend for a fun dinner with friends as the vibe is not very lively. More quiet- perfect for dinner with your significant other. The bread is amazing and the roasted chicken was one of the best"}
{"text":"Food debris and used tissues under the table and on the floor around us, a spill under the table was left to dry naturally, and literally glued my shoes to the floor, lipstick traces on my wine glass, and cutlery I had to wipe before I could use. That was my initial experience. Project that into the kitchen and imagine the results. Shameful for a restaurant on Yorkville. 

I did mention to both servers that my feet were glued to the floor, one just laughed, the other promised someone will come and cleanup, and perhaps someone did after we left, or maybe someone will after they read this. 

The food was passable, nothing special. Service was slow and had to be reminded to refill our wine glasses - at a wine bar?

For dessert, we just went elsewhere. And that is where we will go for food from now on. 

That was on November 15 evening, we were a party of 14 persons. We were seated at a long table downstairs."}
{"text":"I had the grilled calamari appetizer and the pollo matone as my main.  The calamari was wonderful as it was amazingly fresh and tender and the greens it was lying on top of were also very fresh and tasty.  

My main was disappointing though as the chicken (consisting of one thigh and leg) was very dry, the fingerling potatoes were also dry, and the heirloom carrots seemed to have been maybe one carrot cut into small pieces.  I left the place still feeling hungry."}
{"text":"Amazing Summerlicious!
Best salad I've ever had and I don't like fruit in my salads usually. The pasta was full size and loaded with flavour yet very fresh and the cannoli was the perfect ending.
Great service too"}
{"text":"We went with a group of six people attracted by the very nice ambience. I ordered the gnocchi which was extremely ordinary and tasted more like a commissary cafeteria dish than a good restaurant dish. Other people ordered the tuna entree which had micro sized portions and required that they order another dish. The other pastas were mediocre too. Toronto is an expensive city but for the price of dinner my expectations were crushed. This is a place where you go for the ambience and not the food."}
{"text":"Randomly popped into this place for a few cocktails while we were out for a stroll. Absolutely love the atmosphere and the drinks were amazing! The service was pretty great and the staff was really nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"Don't believe the previous reviews.  I came here for Sunday brunch with my girlfriend on a Groupon and was very impressed. Food was fresh and delicious and had a great selection. Service was good, as expected for buffet .  Nice, modern atmosphere!  I admit I didn't love that the food was in 3 levels, but in the end it didn't matter. I highly recommend this restaurant.  Already booked again for my birthday."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood restaurant with great atmosphere!!! Cool interiors with great vibes once enter the restaurant. Good selections of menu with something for everyone. I recommend making a reservation otherwise, you will wait for your table for long time. We were seated at the bar, the seating was not very comfortable, but we were served well. I had pizza with arugula and Parma ham together with wine and it tasted great and perfect pairing!!!  Recommend everyone to try it if you like gourmet pizza with thin crust. I ordered cabernet sauvignon but tasted funny so bar tender immediately changed to different wine and corrected the problem right away. If you want to get together with friends over wine, this is great place to be. Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"I came here with a bunch of people to celebrate my friend's birthday. It was my first time at this location and I found it quieter relative to the King West location which turned out to be a nice surprise, having a section to ourselves. I ordered the ravioli, stuffed with lobster, lemon, bécharmel, and lobster cream sauce. I really enjoyed the rich, creamy flavour of the sauce because while it was prominent, it did not take away the flavour of the lobster stuffed inside. The dish was very tasty, however I did find the portions to be a bit small. With that being said, their customer service did make up for the smaller portions as the servers were always quick to accommodate to our needs. Whether it be taking multiple group photos, surprising our friend with a birthday dessert or overall just tending to our needs as a larger group, they were great! Despite the smaller portions, I would consider coming back for their high quality food and great customer service!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Came to Cibo twice for brunch and it is always busy.  Remember to make reservations. You get a glass of prosseco or mimosa for brunch.  You can get fresh made pizza, pasta and fresh to made eggs.  The food was good but wasn't blown away by anything there.  On the down side on my 2nd visit we got some moldy raspberries.  Good thing I had a closer look.  The 2nd time I went they had the waffle station which was pretty good.  Overall it is a nice atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"Ok....so \"technically\" I can't really put in a full review of this establishment.  I wanted to check out this place and see if it was as nice as it looked from the outside.  Was planning on booking a table for my birthday so I gave them a call.  The girl on the phone put me on hold for a very long time, came back on the line thought I was someone else, placed me on hold again and then sent me to their \"special events\" co-ordinator's voicemail box.  Left a message and have never heard back from them! If you want diners to come to your restaurant it would be a great idea if you returned their phone calls.  Just sayin....so, needless to say, I don't know if I will be ever dining there anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing Cibo for its weekend brunch. I've had dinners here as well, and the fresh pasta is great, but my 4 stars here is for the brunch. I got brunch tickets on groupon, it's possibly not worth it at full price. But at the groupon price, it was really really good. It had a decent spread through both breakfast and lunch type items, some pre made and some fresh. And though the selection wasn't huge, what was there was delicious and had you going back for more (fresh croissants with all the Nutella you could ever want, anyone?)"}
{"text":"Beautiful place for brunch. First time I came, there was pasta and prosciutto. This time around was rack of lamb and a waffle station. It was great because we took guests that were in town and ambiance was great. Would definitely come again and recommended for brunch date."}
{"text":"i come here once a week for the best pizza! setting is a little weird but love the food and italian soda"}
{"text":"I didn't have the opportunity to eat her and probably was my good fortune. 

It was a long weekend so the patios were pretty busy all over king street. My friend and I wanted to put our names on the wait list but the ladies at the door was so unfriendly, pretentious and least inviting. 

I guess it has everything to do with how fake and superficial Toronto is becoming but when the girls themselves are very unattractive, I highly doubt they should be the gatekeepers of whom should be allowed in and whom denied entry. 

If I wanted this horrible Las Vegas night club treatment I would have just gone to a club but alas I was hungry and in search for a meal, not judgement. Won't ever be coming back to try."}
{"text":"Third time here and I can honestly say I've tried everything on the menu (not that there's much). So here it is. 

Pros 
Drinks taste good (especially mimosa) 
Good ambiance 
Make your pizza in front of you in minutes 

Cons
Food is honestly tasteless (other than the pizza and the pesto pasta) 
Pricey ($35/person for Sunday Brunch) especially given there are other restaurants in that area with auxh better bang for your buck. 
Very limited selection of food."}
{"text":"Me and fiance both liked it overall. 

price is a little bit on the higher side.
Food quality is very good.
you have a wide verity of wines.

They have spent a lot of money and probably hired a good interior designer. I always like to go to a place that it everything is brand new and in Cibo you get this feeling.

I will go back again for sure. :-)"}
{"text":"I had high hopes given the reviews.  Service was lovely but food was bland and overly salty (and I actually love salty food).  We ordered a fresh tomato dish and the tomatoes weren't ripe.  Lamb ragu was salty and the vanilla pannacotta tasted of freezer burn - which is strange but it had a strawberry sauce - which may have been in the freezer previously.

There are far better Italian restaurants in the city - Gusto 101, Buca, Caffino, etc... don't waste your hard earned money here"}
{"text":"Obviously they have a fantastic wine list, many many options! But I have to be honest the food sucks..calamari is very tough and I could go on..but great atmosphere for drinks/wine especially for dates!"}
{"text":"For the neighbourhood, I think this place is great.  Fun, loud, nice staff, good food that isn't priced too high.  Very accessible, local spot for a quick bite or a drink.   If we can't have Terroni, it's the next best thing."}
{"text":"The design and decor of this trendy King West restaurant is beautiful but the woman on the door, hostess is sorely lacking in any notion of hospitality.
We were scouting for a venue for our group and decided to book a table for two a week later to try it out.
The hostess could not have been more flat in her attitude. No smile, no table for two available, no \"aw I'm sorry\" just \"no\".
We left and will never know how the rest of the experience
You only get one chance to make to make a good first impression."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time this past weekend for a little pre-wedding girls night out with 3 other girls. We had the carpaccio plus two other apps to start. I'm ashamed to say I'm not fluent in Italian food yet but I'm pretty sure it was one of the arugulas and the prosciutto, all three of which I enjoyed, although I wouldn't say the arugula wasn't outstanding. 

I had the lobster ravioli which I thought was absolutely divine, and the other girls all agreed! It was stuffed with lobster chunks, and at less than $20, I'd say it was a pretty good value too. Definitely worth going back for, although I'm not sure you'd be full from it on its own if you don't also order some of the starters. 

-1 star for the layout, which I found incredibly cramped for a 4-top. The server kept having to reach over the table because there was no room for her to maneuver behind the table."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere but no 5 star because it took us an extra 20mins to get there due to the king street fiasco. Next time we will go to Yorkville instead....way too much trouble for king street driving."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! 
The waiters/waitresses are always extremely polite and really know the menu! 
The hostesses are terrible and extremely rude, they really do act as if you are bothering them. 

Decor - 5/5
Service - 4/5 
Food - 5/5"}
{"text":"I accidentally walked in here. The vibe and ambiance was great. We waited by the bar for our table and had wine. Gewurzzz something white wine. Absolutely delicious. We had apps: mushroom and sausage and bread, simply amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the King West location before, so I was excited to go to another location! This location is a 3.5.

Reservations are highly recommended!!!!!

The decor here was similar, but had super high ceilings and 2 levels. Pretty nice place. On this occasion, I didn't have reservations. We were seated in the bar area. Noise level was as expected, but no big deal. 

We didn't get bread to start, like the other location. I had the Shrimp Fettucine. It was creamy with tons of shrimp! Paste was true al dente and the portion was big! The pesto and tomato sauce were the perfect combination. For dessert, HAD to have the assorted gelato. This time I had chocolate, biscotti and coconut. A winner, once again!

The issue was with service. I realize I didn't have reservations, I know, but it doesn't mean service should suffer. Our server was also the only bartender. So, she would disappear for periods of time for drinks for the servers in the dining room. This would be ok, if we didn't need anything else. Trying to flag her down took about 10min or so. Not great when your food is getting cold and you need something.

I'll definitely make reservations next time! Hope the service is better in the dining area!"}
{"text":"We ate here last night on vacation from Boston. Our server (Reilly) was very good and attentive. We both had pasta dishes and they were both very good, would recommend here to anyone."}
{"text":"Went to Cibo a few weeks ago with a group of 14 for a friends birthday.  Before we ordered anything, we (actually two of us) asked if we could have separate bills.  One would think, not a big deal and the waiter said \"no problem\".  I asked if he could give me the bill for the birthday girl so we could split it and pay for her.  Again, \"no problem\". 

Unfortunately, at the end of the night, PROBLEM!  The waiter comes with one bill and not the agreed upon 14 bills.  He suggests that we just spilt the bill evenly between all of us, but not everyone knows each other and many have spent less or more than what a spilt bill would be.  The manager says they do not do separate bills, that it is their policy.  Both said that it would take too long to separate it out.  That's why we asked at the beginning of the night, before we ordered drinks and appetizers!  They left us to figure out the amount, tried to charge us for two things we never ordered and when we left, we passed another, yet smaller party with separate bills.

This is on top of the fact that it took a very long time for our server to take our orders and half way through, he stopped and went off to get something for one of his other tables, without excusing himself.  He continued to take our order 5 minutes later.

The food was ok and the restaurant itself is beautiful.  However, the bad experience at the end of the night left a bad taste in the mouths of ALL who were in our party.

There are other restaurants in the city and neighbourhood who have better food and service!  I would recommend that you go to one of them."}
{"text":"I have to say, I was expecting much less considering the reviews are less than spectacular for this place.

3.5 stars for Cibo.

I came here for Sunday brunch.  $35 per person, ayce, and it includes a glass of prosecco or a mimosa.  

There isn't a huge variety of food, but there certainly was enough.  One of the hostesses walked us up, gave a brief tour, and led us to our seats.  

Food stations:

Pasta-Three types of pasta in three types of sauces.  No sure if you can mix and match but we were told the pasta is made in-house.  

Cheese and bread-Four types of cheeses to choose from, mild to strong.  

Antipasto/risotto/sandwiches/bruschetta/fried stuff-There were sundried tomatoes, marinated mushrooms, artichokes, etc. There was only one vegetarian risotto (zucchini and paddy pans). The sandwiches and bruschetta I didn't look too closely at.  A heat lamp section was warming the polenta fries (which oddly tasted like Cheetos) and arancini, rice balls.  I almost forgot the poached eggs in tomato sauce in the same section.

Pizza-Made to order pizzas!  Cooked in a stone oven.  This was our favourite.  Toppings were pretty good, including bocconcini, marinated veggies, and various meats.  

Seafood-Smoked salmon, mussels, and marinated calamari (or was it octopus?).

Salad-Three types were shown as samples, but I did overhear the server say they could make whatever variation upon request.

Eggs-I guess the eggs were made to order? I didn't get anything from here until I saw someone with a poached egg on spinach and smoked salmon.  I definitely had to get that!  There were a few covered dishes, like potatoes, bacon, and sausages, in the back area as well.

Dolci/dessert-There was actually a lot to choose from: cakes, pies, mini desserts, some in ramekins.  Fruit was also offered, one plate of orange sections, another of fruit salad.

Organization?  A bit odd.  Spacious, that's for sure.  The service was kind of iffy.  My side plate was removed too soon.  Where was I supposed to put my cutlery if I wanted a second or third round of food?  

It was good, not great, not terrible.  3.5 stars seems about right.  I'm gonna round up to 4 stars!"}
{"text":"After living in my new place for well over a year, my neighbour and I finally got a chance to hang out! After tossing a few ideas back and forth, we decided on Cibo's King West location. The décor is fabulous; wood walls with slots for backlit wine bottles. Classy! The seating was comfortable and nicely spaced out.  Noise level gets a bit high in there, but it wasn't too bad. 

Highly recommended to make reservations!!! 

We had 2 servers which was different, but a great way to do it. There was always someone around if you needed something and they were both fabulous. They were a great help in choosing wine as well! 

I went with the Lobster Ravioli and she had the Gnocchi. I was a little worried about portion sizes. Many nice restaurants, like this, give very small portions; this was not one of them! The portions were decent and we could barely finish. The sauces were creamy and flavourful. The ravioli were full of lobster and bechamel. Delicious! 

Who am I kidding? Always room for dessert! She couldn't resist Tiramisu and I picked Assorted Gelato. My gelato flavours were chocolate, vanilla and mocha. The mocha and vanilla outshined the chocolate on this one. Topped with fruit, this was the perfect dessert. The Tiramisu was ok, not great, not bad, just ok. We both paired our desserts with espresso and it was proper espresso. So good! 

Great Italian food! Love the ambience; buzzing with a good time. 

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We went to Cibo for brunch using a Groupin deal that I purchased ($35 for 2 people). The environment/ambience was great! It had a modern yet a rustic feel to it. It was a large space and even had a 2nd floor overlooking the main dining area. However, the tables are set pretty close together. It was fairly busy when we went, so walking around to get food was a bit cumbersome with such tight setting of the tables. 

The service was great. Our waitress was friendly and welcoming. So was the hostess in the front. 

Brunch is buffet style and is all you can eat with food stations set in different corners of the main dining area. They offered a variety of cheeses, fresh bread, fruits, pizza, pasta, sandwiches, cold cuts, dessert. Brunch also offers mimosa and tea/coffee. The made to order pizza was pretty delicious. I also enjoyed the yogurt parfait. Unfortunately, all the other dishes were just ok. I think I would go back to give dinner a try, but I'd probably not return for brunch (especially if I had to pay full price )."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant located in downtown Toronto near the entertainment district. Ideal for small groups and medium sized group events. Tried the risotto, which was really delicious. The lobster ravioli is also a good choice. Our server was amazing, super helpful and patient."}
{"text":"Came for Sunday brunch. This is an Italian buffet. Our waiter bought a platter with bread and olives for the table. The olives were salty and bread had herbs on top. First round I got the polenta fries, rice balls (there were two dipping sauces, red and white), penne pasta, and various cheese and cured meats. The cured meats were heavily salted and all taste like pepperoni. The rice balls were my fav. Second round I got fruits, smoked salmon, clams, shrimps, and a bowl of made to order rotini pasta in a creamy mushroom sauce with chicken. This was sooo good. My last round I got more fruits, tiramisu cake, and cheese cake. My fav was Tiramisu which was fluffy and light. Cheese cake was okay. If I had more room I would have got waffles and made to order personal pizza which looked fun. There was someone who made sure our water is refilled and the plates are cleared. The seats were a bit cramped and the plates were heavy but the decor was warm and inviting. For a buffet place it was classy would come back!"}
{"text":"Recently had dinner at Cibo on a Saturday night with friends for my birthday. 
The restaurant is \"new\" and came with good feedback. 
Saturday night at Cibo in Yorkville is a busy place to be. Reservations are recommended as the place is very popular. 

We were seated downstairs at a spacious booth. Our waitress, was friendly but needed many reminders to provide us bread and water for the table. It was apparent that she was busy, and maybe this was the reason why. Eventually another waitress came along with double servings of bread and olives for the table, along with a bottle of water for the table. 
I ordered the green salad to start, which was fresh and flavorful. I enjoyed it. 
For my main, I had the spaghetti carbonara and it too was good. My feedback on this dish is that it tended to be a bit oily at the bottom of the dish, the pancetta was under cooked, and there was no cracked black pepper to be found on the dish. 
Something I also found unusual was that the waitress didn't return to offer cheese or pepper for any of our dishes. 

The prices are very reasonable at Cibo and overall I would say that the food was good, but not great."}
{"text":"This place is great and is a funkier interior than the other location. The service is very good and on top of things. They have a delicious selection and variety of cocktails and wine options. It's a nice spot for a date or intimate night out with friends for a celebration. It is quite pricey but it is a lovely place for a night out on the town!"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 6 on Saturday night. The place was packed and understaffed. The service was awful. 

At first I thought it was forgivable that our server ignored our table for nearly 20 minutes--no water refills and didn't bring our drinks--because they were so busy. But as the evening progressed it became clear that the bussers were simply not doing their jobs. Empty side plates and glasses sat for nearly the duration of our meal. Speaking of our meal, the food was  sub par.

We had: 
Fettuccini bolognaise - bland 1/5
Cheese tortellini in Alfredo sauce 3/5 - to me it was bland but the guy who ordered it liked it.
Fish of the day: branzino - 3/5 well cooked but bland
Margarita pizza - 2/5 bland 
Grilled octopus- 3/5 overcooked but edible 

For desert we had the Nutella pizza which was not made with Nutella but an imitation chocolate spread. 3/5 it was tasty but it wasn't Nutella. 

There were no salt shakers on the table which demonstrates a gross and misguided overconfidence in their flavourless food.  

The atmosphere is nice and the wine list is extensive but I don't think I will be back to cibo on Yonge.

This is a Liberty Group establishment. I have yet to enjoy a proper evening of good food and great service at one of their places. If I can give a tip it would be to avoid Liberty Group restaurants."}
{"text":"I went to Cibo last night with a group of 4.

The room is beautiful. Wood and brick with dim lighting. Very busy on a Friday night, I suggest you make a reservation. 

The service was pretty good. Friendly server who accommodated our request for a white whine by the glass that is typically by the bottle. I agree with some other yelpers that the by the glass wine selection could have been broader--it's a WINE BAR. But I had 2 very nice glasses of red. A Brunello and a Pinot Noir so I can't complain. 

To eat we had:
Margarita pizza - good but tasted more like a plain cheese pizza with a few basil leaves on top. 
Arugala salad with mushroom and parmesan cheese - tasted how it sounds. I was a fan.
Chicken Parmesan - this was disappointing. 
Pasta with light cream sauce and porcini mushrooms with chicken added - it was very tasty. 
Branzino- this was the fish special. It was fine. Nothing special, nothing offensive. it came with squash blossoms. 
Nutella pizza for desert which was ok. 
The bread they bring to the table is very tasty but could be warmer.

I suggest sticking with the pizza and pasta here. 

The atmosphere at Cibo is 5/5
The food is 3/5 
The service is 4/5  - our dirty plates were left a little longer than what was comfortable. 
I realize these numbers average a 4 star review, but it just wasn't a 4 star experience. 

Maybe I will return to Cibo if another friend requests to go there, but I wouldn't select it for myself."}
{"text":"Last weekend I came here for dinner and we had a really good experience. 

The waitress was extremely attentive and she continuously refilled our water glasses before we had to ask. She was also really helpful when I placed my order since I'm both gluten and lactose intolerant. The waitress told me I could eat any of the pasta dishes by substituting the pasta listed with their gluten free variety.

We started the evening with an order of grilled calamari. It was presented to our table beautifully with the calamari laying on a bed of mixed greens and diced tomatoes.

I ended up choosing a pasta dish featuring rapini, spicy Italian sausage, fontina, garlic, and extra-virgin olive oil. It was absolutely scrumptious!  My friend ordered the gnocchi and he really enjoyed his dish as well. He said it mouth watering.

Allover, we had a really great experience and I would definitely return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Had been looking forward to coming here for a little while, so I was glad I finally got here when I did! Came with a bunch of friends to celebrate the end if summer!

Unfortunately, it was an extremely hot day, and the AC in the restaurant wasn't able to keep up. We ended up at a table that didn't have any vents above, so it was uncomfortably warm. 

Luckily, the food was really, really good! Our table ordered quite a bit of food, but I'm just gonna highlight the items I really liked and tried. First off, their complementary bread was really good! Salty and herbed, it was a nice compliment to the hot peppers that came with it, and the oil and vinegar on the table. 
The Carpaccio was excellent as well! With a nice accompaniment of some leaves, the light overall taste was outstanding. 
For my main, I got the Orrechiette, which was amazing as well. It was freshly made in house, and the pasta itself was quite tasty. Paired with Italian sausage and broccolini, it was a wonderful combination.

Overall a great food experience, but our service wasn't the greatest. The server seemed a bit... slow. We needed to ask for bread twice and for water thrice. She didn't even offer cheese and pepper for our entrees. She didn't quite seem to be on top of things. The bartender came by to help out our table, and she was excellent. 

I would definitely come back, just not on a super hot day, and hopefully sit at a table further inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"If you want a fun, beautiful atmosphere, this is a good place. But if you also want decent food and reasonable value for your money - do not go to Cibo. I have been several times, and if you stick to bread/pasta based things you will get enough to eat, although it is bland and uninspired. The rare tuna salad at lunch is a portion of tuna the size of one of those pink erasers you used in school along with 6 green beans and perhaps 1/3 cup of arugula. No evidence of the grape/olive salsa. Cost $18. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, trendy little spot. Sommelier was excellent very helpful! Food was in between good and excellent. Service was great in the beginning and tapered off towards the end. We had to remind the waiter to bring us dessert. But overall had great experience."}
{"text":"For being a restaurant with the most uninspired name possible... \"Food\" in Italian, This place is pretty solid, although it definitely isn't authentic Italian. Having recently traveled for three weeks all across Italy sampling cuisine from six different regions, I feel a tad spoiled but this place still gets four out of 5 for the wine list, nice servers and attention to detail. Great work!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner for Summerlicious 2015.

Their entrance set up is kind of strange. There were three hostesses seating people, but there still seemed to be a rather long line of four, five parties, and the restaurant was not busy at all. When it was our turn, we walked up the stairs only to stop midstep because that's where the menus and cutlery are kept. We blocked the people trying to come down the steps to leave. It's just not a very smart setup. 

The process for ordering and the food coming out all happened very quickly, which was great. You also get fresh bread, which was very yummy.

APPETIZER: Crispy Eggplant Parmigianna
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fresh mozzarella, tomato, basil. The eggplant, cheese, and tomato sauce combination was tasty. I'm not sure I would call it \"crispy\" though because it was a little mushy. 

MAIN: Crispy Skin Arctic Char
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lemon caper drizzle, baby summer squash, fava bean, arugula, spring onions, lemon olive oil. The fish was great, especially because I don't normally like fish. The skin probably could have been a little crispier and there could have been a few more vegetables, but it was enjoyable nonetheless.

DESSERT: Italian Trifle
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Strawberry mascarpone cream, white chocolate shavings. Yum. 

Service was average-ish. Once our meal was done and we tried to get the bill, our server suddenly became completely inaccessible. But in general, I enjoyed CIBO."}
{"text":"Cibo's food was great however the restaurant manager was crass and unprofessional. Our server forgot to pack my pasta (which I only ate 1/3 of because the servings were huge), after being reminded 5 times, he told me someone in the kitchen threw it out so they could make a new one if I waited. I was in no mood to wait  and simply asked for a credit I could use towards paste the next time I came to the restaurant. The server had to ask his manager who then suggested, that myself and three of my girlfriends get vodka shots instead??!! How disgusting and rude is that! Why would you assume that giving us shots of vodka would make up for the less than mediocre service I received that evening?

That is no way to treat your guests. Too bad that the service and overall atmosphere was terrible, the food was great but will never go back and will ensure everyone in my extended network of friends is strongly discouraged from going there too. WASTE OF MONEY!! Send the restaurant manager to hospitality school so he can learn etiquette and manners."}
{"text":"Came for drinks with friends one night and made a point to come back to try the food. Well did and was not overly impressed. The food wasn't bad it just lacked flavor and nothing really stood out. We have a lot of great food in this city so will choose to go else where for dinner in the future. Glad I gave it a try."}
{"text":"Dining date: 3/19 Saturday lunch time

Order: de Napoli pizza, ravioli, linguine, risoto, and parpadelle.

Service: 5/5 friendly, courteous staff
Food: 3.5/5 good but pasta were generally on the salty side"}
{"text":"5 star restaurant.  The short ribs and carpaccios are amazing.  Only thing I would say I was disappointed in was the lack of local wines. Being a wine bar,  if locals are supporting your restaurant.... You should support your local wineries."}
{"text":"We went to Cibo last night to celebrate my best friend's engagement.. 4 girls total.

I had heard great things about their King St. location, so I was very excited to taste and see what my friends were raving about a little bit more uptown.

The restaurant, upon entry, seemed extremely warm and inviting, the decor and ambiance was very rustic, but modern, and the place was packed.  We were seated in the back of the restaurant and saw chefs hard at work, pressing freshly made pasta through machines, etc. looked very authentic...

We ordered two bottles of J.Lohr Cabernet... They had a very extensive wine list (hence the name, wine bar).  As appetizers we ordered the Prociutto and Formaggio board, aranccini (rice balls) and an arugula salad.  Both were very tasty and well priced.  Their in-house bread was very warm, fluffy, and tasty as well.

For mains, we shared two pizzas (Americana, Capricciosa) and a pasta.  First we ordered their basic gnocchi with a simple tomato sauce... When the waitress brought out our order, the gnocchi was hard and cold. We weren't impressed, so we sent back the pasta with no questions asked.  After that, we decided to order the cannelloni stuffed lobster in a rosé sauce.  Wow--- very, very salty. The sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the presentation of the pasta was not what I had expected.  We sent that back too... After all that, we just stuck to our previous orders.  The manager was very kind and took the pasta away (again), with no questions asked.  

I would come to Cibo again to try other dishes... The pizzas were great and everything else we ordered was on-par.  The ambiance is excellent.  The waitress was fairly knowledgeable and the wine (of course), was excellent."}
{"text":"Place is always packed. We decided to come here in a group of 4 on a whim... They took us about 20 mins after we put our name on the reservation list.  Very accommodating!  The decor is awesome, but the restaurant was stifling hot!!!! Made it uncomfortable to sit for a long period of time.  We ordered the carpaccio, 2 cheese and meat boards, pepperoni pizza and steak.  Food was decent, not bad.  In terms of noise level, it was quite loud in the restaurant overall. Much prefer their Yonge St. location."}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant where you'll either have bad service, terrible dishes or a manager that just couldn't care less. 

This afternoon, however, we were blessed with a new server who didn't really how to work in a restaurant - and although she did everything in her interest to make-up for the kitchen's disasters - her manager YITZ (spelling may be incorrect) but this guy couldn't even get a shit about his business or how the food is coming out of the kitchen. 

My boyfriend and I have worked in this industry for over 25 years collectively (and we are in our mid-twenties) NEVER have we encountered such NEGLECT AND DISMAY about their staff or products from a manager.

Only once have we had a great server paired great food from the kitchen operated by a rightful manager. 

DEAR CIBO:

Your server training is ABYSMAL
Your cooks don't have a passion for food
Your managers just want the money. 

Corporate or not, this should NOT BE HAPPENING. 

Find people who care or close. 
It's too expensive for the quality of ingredients and the \"service\" you assume you're providing to your clientele, just ISNT THERE."}
{"text":"Everyone was very satisfied with their appetizers and entrees.... the food was prepared and presented wonderfully. The ambiance is very invited but quite noisy because of the high ceilings and open space. We went to the Yorkville location which is perfect for a stroll afterwards. I would highly recommend it even if they forgot to acknowledge my daughters birthday which I specified upon booking and also to the hostess."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, I have never visited this place, but they have an express stand at Pearson Airport that is really bad. So I would never visit their other locations. 

At the airport they have these iPads for servers. You have to order with stupid iPads. Employees look like automatons, they don't greet anyone, don't smile, don't even say \"hi\". All they do is bring you a poor quality food that was most likely trucked here in a box; at least that's what it tastes like.  I can't wait for real robots to take over those pitiful people's jobs.  Maybe then we will have real service. 

I won't mention the outrageous prices because everything is expensive at Pearson. But they have the audacity to automatically add 18% tips on the bills. For what? Not for the food! Not for the service!  

As customers have we gotten so lame as to willingly pay tips when a computer serves us? And have stupid business owners fallen so far to the left of the economical spectrum to be willing to help their worthless employees automatically make 18% tips?  Lamentable! 

This was my first and last time at any CIBO location."}
{"text":"It was a lovely brunch buffet and had a wide range of selections at buffet bar as well as made-to-order options. Will definitely recommend in the same category and will visit back for special occasion. Must book in advance."}
{"text":"Just had lunch , at best a 2 star . Let me explain , when one page of a 4 page menu is pizza and your told that we can only make 4 pizzas at a time and you should eat your main then the pizza will be ready was the first flag that something didn't add up. When having oasta at an Italian restaurant there should always be bread on the table . Our main courses came and good luck finding any. Once again we were told they are running behind on bread in the pizza oven. I did. Get my second beer , good luck finding anyone , and the restaurant wasn't busy at all!"}
{"text":"I love the food, atmosphere and the staff ... The head chef Savario and the manager Marcello make every experience pleasant .  The gorgonzola pear pizza is a must try.  The lamb ragu pasta just melts in your mouth!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday and was not disappointed at all. Me and my boyfriend ordered a cheese & meat platter, and shared a pizza. We ended up being so full that the pizza stuffed us. The quality of the food and service was amazing! My boyfriend accidentally spilled water onto the cheese board and our server immediately switched it out, no problem. We paired it with a bottle of wine and had a glass of sangria. We also got complimentary bread as our starter. Not to mention, interior was gorgeous- rustic vibes, exposed brick, industrial lights, low light which provided an intimate setting. Definitely coming back for a future visit. Thank you for providing great service and food!"}
{"text":"I have been to Cibo countless times and have never left disappointed. Their hostesses and servers go above and beyond every time and the food is absolutely fabulous. I ALWAYS order their polenta fries which is the best I have ever had. It is presented in such a cool way and comes with the most amazing Gorgonzola and marinara sauce. Heaven on earth! We also usually get the arancini which has a light taste with just the right amount of cheese and sauce. Their pastas, rissottos (esp. the seafood one) and pizzas are dream!! Also, they will give you complimentary house baked bread which may be the best bread I have ever tasted. Excellent vibe, great wine list, chill ambience and stunning interiors! A gem of a place!!"}
{"text":"Surprised at how decent the food was! Thought it was just a large franchise like joeys with multiple locations serving average food. Came here or a birthday and it was a set menu of many items to share. Overall good experience and good food! For cocktails get the amaretto sour - was so good!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this restaurant has a low rating. The atmosphere is great, the staff is very friendly and accommodating, AND the food is great! I tried the spaghetti Pomodoro and Caesar salad, both great choices. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Came here for Happy Hour between 4pm - 7pm where the drinks are half price. Cocktails, Rail, and Beer are all half price and we chilled on the patio. The restaurant itself looks very nice as does mostly everything in Yorkville does.... but do not come here for the food. We ordered 3 different types of pizzas and they all tasted bland and the toppings were not fresh at all. I could compare it to Delissio pizza but that would be an insult to Delissio because Delissio is much much better. We had some fries which were decent but nothing special. The bread was delicious because it was coated in some special sauce. 

They have a ton of wine selections and tons of drinks which was the main reason why we came here. Our server was hilarious but she openly told us how poorly this place is managed when she was the only one responsible for all of the tables and her manager was really not helping out at all.

Anyways, come here for the drinks and make sure you eat a big meal before you come. I should have listened to the Yelp Reviews....oh why do I ever doubt my fellow Yelpers? I guess I like living my life on the edge thats why! Haha!"}
{"text":"I came for dinner and had a seat on the patio. The ambiance was nice and staff was decent.  The menu is pretty extensive and contains all things Italian. 

The bread to start was very tasty and has an amazing rosemary and sea salt flavour. 
I ordered a soup to start and got the stracciatella. It was much more filling than I expected and tasted great. For a main I got the orecchiette In house pasta. The flavour of the ingredients were good and well put together though the temperature of the dish when served wasn't as hot as I thought it would be. 
For dessert I shared the tiramisu which was the perfect amount of sweetness and had good texture, but could've had a stronger coffee flavour. 

Overall a nice scene to sit outside and have an enjoyable night with friends"}

Seeing their disappointment the waitress told the kitchen and they made and exception and surprised us with their pastas
Cute gesture, very much appreciated

Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I got a Sunday brunch groupon and went with a group of friends today. Overall the food was good (especially the pizza) but their service is disappointing to say. 

1. So a group of us ordered coffee at the end and one of us forgot to order and he ordered when the sever brought the group their coffee. Our server said \"why don't you order together?\"...I think as customers we can order whenever we want and her job was to serve us. 

2. Secondly, we went as a group of six so the brunch comes with one mimosa or poseco per person. So four of us ordered their drinks and then the other two ordered later. The server charged us the last two drinks because she said the same person drunk the last two drinks. I thought our table has six drinks that comes with the brunch. how come the restaurant would charge us based  who drunk it? She told us she was watching us.... Very wired and I have never experienced this kind of policy before. 

Overall the food was alright but this restaurant is screwed by their servers and policies."}
{"text":"Great place to satisfy your Italian food craving, but also have a nice get together with friends. I had the polenta fries, with one of the pizza. I don't usually like pizza but this pizza WAS GOOD PIZZA. 
Service was great, servers very attentive and congenial!"}
{"text":"Where is the meat??? Overpriced italian.  We went there for mother's day brunch last week with family of 11.  Ambience is nice but FOOD is a rip-off.  None of the buffet items had any meat.  Pasta was bland, pizza they pull out a pack of tri-stella mozarella instead of fresh mozzarella, the only meat was a dried bland lamb that nobody hardly ate and sat there for hours.  The red velvet cake was dense and dry and the canoli filling had a really weird texture. Worst of all they charge my 2-year daughter $15 buffet fee.  WTF!!!! And they will charge 18% service...for buffet???? Stay away from this place unless you want to a nice ambiance get filled up with carbs and spend $50/pp."}
{"text":"Great vibe, attentive staff, mediocre pizza. The crust was too doughy and dense. By Toronto standards it's decent, but it's also really hard to find a good pizza here. I will say, the Cibo Ale was fantastic. A smooth amber beer that really complimented the meal. Definitely a winner. If I were to return, and I would for the vibe and staff, I'd probably order a charcuterie board or a primo."}
{"text":"Winterlicious lunch at cibo was not the most memorable. But shouldn't really judge a restaurant based on a winterlicious experience anyway! The atmosphere and decor were 4/5. But the food and service were 2.5 to 3/5. We had a group of 4 and tired a variety of dishes but nothing really stood out. 

Would like to give this place another try - from the regular menu"}
{"text":"*3.5 stars 

If you ever have a craving for italian and are in the area of yorkville, Cibo would be a great option. I've been to their King Street location and enjoyed it so decided to try the yorkville location last week.

Interior of the restaurant reminded me of their previous restaurant Ciao. (which was also italian) Upon entering, you are greeted by a friendly hostess and an attentive server. We were super hungry and opted to order our classics: Deep fried calamari, ceaser salad, Spaghetti carbonera and Mushroom Funghi pizza. Price was a little steep for the calamari, but the portion size did compensate it a little bit. Super crispy and came with two different types of sauce, Garlic aioli and a marinara sauce. Both quite tasty.

Ceaser salad came with huge slices of parmiginao-reggino and crispy bacon pieces. A little on the small side for 14$ and would probably not order it again the next time we're there. Salad was a little saucy as well so if you don't like overly dressed salad I would opt for something else.

My fiance was super excited to try the carbonera but was dissapointed with the portion size! Although the plate was huge, the portion of the pasta was small. Furthermore, the pasta was a little too greasy for our liking (lots of oil at the end!!) Perhaps from the bacon.. but we were truly dissapointed.

Me on the other hand ordered the mushroom funghi pizza and I thought it was delicious. It was the perfect amount of mushroom and truffle oil. There were a variety of different mushroom topping such as King Oyster mushrooms. A little touch of their chilli added a special kick to the pizza as well. The size is standard like any other Neapolitan pizza. 

One thing to comment about though is their bread. Their bread is sooooo good. It is definitely worth going back even if it's just to have some bread! I think next time we will give another pasta dish a try. They do have a variety of items and it's good especially for those who like options!"}
{"text":"Just terrible.

Server literally arrives at table, pours water and demands to know if we're drinking something other than water...we'd sat down ten seconds earlier.

The Strachiatella soup was essentially hot water with egg in it
The Papardelle was luke warm and clumped together (i.e cooked improperly)

So, terrible service and terrible food, absolutely nothing redeeming about this place."}
{"text":"Cibo is an expansive Italian restaurant with an equally expansive menu. I came here on Friday night and it was packed with a line of people waiting, so it is wise to make reservations. 

We were warmly greeted by the host and led to a nice, big table in the centre of the restaurant. Cibo has a very sophisticated air to it and customers were dressed to the nines! The kitchen is open so you can observe the mayhem going on. This is not a quiet, romantic Italian place; it is bustling, lively, and loud! 

Our server was quite friendly and told us about the specials of the day. The complimentary rosemary bread was burned at the top (ugh!), but was accompanied with delicious olives. I ordered the di Nicolino pizza, which came with arugula and prosciutto. It was quite delicious, but could have been a little more crispy in the centre. Our food was served 10 minutes after placing our order, which is nice if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant to celebrate a friends birthday and had such a fun time! We ate in the downstairs portion which looked like a cavern, which made for an interesting experience! The aesthetic is amazing, exposed brick and cute trendy decor, needless to say it's an Instagrammers dream! We started off with drinks, I got the upgraded version of a regular amaretto sour and it was great! Next we got a couple of appetizers for the table: calamari, polenta fries and pizza. All three were amazing, the leftover Gorgonzola cheese dip that came along with the fries also substituting as an amazing dip for the pizza crust! For my main I ordered the lobster ravioli and it was absolutely to die for!!!! I would recommend it to anyone and everyone who's looking to divulge into an amazing pasta dish. I couldn't be happier with my main. You could tell just how fresh the pasta was and the lobster stuffing was filled to the brim with just the right amount of flakiness. My only qualm is that I wish there was more (because it was that good)! We topped off the night with some dessert which just like everything else was delicious! The staff was amazing and attentive and each course was delivered in a timely fashion, even though the place was absolutely booked. I can't wait to come back here and eat again and try some of the other amazing stuff on the menu! Definitely would recommend this place to anyone who's after just plain amazing Italian food!"}
{"text":"It is a nice place, friendly environment but too friendly as the tables are really close, you can her other table conversations. The food it was good."}
{"text":"One of my \"never fails\"/\"go to\" places -- probably because there are so many items on the menu that I continue to want to try and continue to come back in an attempt to try everything. Great spot to hit up before going out on the weekends and a nice patio during the summer time.

PS. Floors are a bit slippery - saw several girls almost wipe out in their heels."}
{"text":"One of the best Italians in the city.  Love coming here,  food is crazy good and service is unreal."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Didn't even bother to bring us the complimentary bread, didn't bother to check up on us and we were out of water half way through our dinner. Why? Because we're not breaking the bank having dinner here? The food didn't stand out to me either. The only food that was good worth mentioning was the gnocchi, the only reason why it barely made the 2 star. Not worth waiting 40 minutes on a friday night."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great. Beautiful venue. Food is very meh. 

We got five apps and a pasta. Calamari, carpaccio and eggplant parm were good, caprese was mediocre (hard to do when you're using bufala), and octopus was flat-out bad. 

The pasta was a story in itself. There's two linguine's on the menu - vongole (white or red) and seafood (red). I ordered seafood. I received white vongole. I explained the issue. They returned with a red vongole. I explained again. They finally returned with seafood. Granted, they did the right thing and comped the pasta. But it was painfully obvious that neither the waiter or the runner knew what the hell I was talking about as I patiently explained that they brought me the wrong linguine dish. 

They also overcharged - by 100% - three glasses of wine. They corrected the error, but again, incompetence galore.

Atmosphere is great, but food and professionalism are severely lacking. Don't bother coming here."}
{"text":"Before I rant about my terrible meal, I should note that I have previously enjoyed Cibo King West and at Yonge/Eg. I also really enjoyed Ciao, the restaurant sharing the same owners as Cibo that previously operated in the same space. This particular evening, I dined with 3 girlfriends.

I ordered the gnocchi, which I have previously had at both other locations. The tomato sauce had absolutely no taste. Another one of my friends also ordered a dish with the tomato sauce and agreed. We immediately notified the waitress. She offered to bring us chili oil. Never did she offer to let us order a new dish or to remake our meals. Instead she said \"I've been hearing complaints from other tables too.\" The waitress also told my friend that her food might not taste good because of alterations (she had not even made any to the menu-item but not professional to argue with the customer). She also never offered to let us speak to a manager. Her attempted resolution was highly unprofessional and inadequate (especially if other tables had voiced a similar concern).

At the end of the meal, we asked to speak to the manager (we were hopeful that the waitress would have been told the manager to visit our table after 2/4 of us complained but clearly this was wishful thinking). We shared our experience with her and she said she would \"take care of it\". We assumed we all got a free meal as is generally the outcome when more than one person is unhappy with their meal. She didn't charge my friend and I for our meals. I thought it was so tacky that they charged the other two guests. Even though they were satisfied with their meals, our dissatisfaction and complaining impacted their dining experience. The manager was hardly apologetic. Before we were able to get 2/4 meals comped, she offered us dessert ... not really enough considering how awful the food was.

They better get their act together if other customers expressed a similar concern. Too bad for them ... I live a block away and wanted to like it."}
{"text":"Perfect price points and a great hit for my palate. Service was great the past couple of time and their quality was consistent each time. 

I plan to be a regular every Tuesday because, it's lobster night!"}
{"text":"This is a great place - nice ambiance and good service. 

The menu has a great selection of items. I ordered the grilled calamari and the arugula prosciutto salad. Once my order was placed, the server came by with some warm flatbread which was very tasty! And soon after, my good came which was great because I was so hungry! The calamari was very tender and cooked perfectly. My salad was good too! 

Overall, the food was good but what I enjoyed most was the atmosphere. I would recommend this spot if you are looking for a nice dinner spot in the city."}
{"text":"We walked in last weekend to have some wine on my birthday. 

The establishment itself is beautiful. From outside looking in, it's very inviting and you would want to come in. The entrance wall is decorated with Crystal head vodka bottles. In the centre of the restaurant, there's glass-enclosed wine tower which stretches from floor to ceiling. 

Food: nothing special. We ordered the following 3 appys to share: grilled calamari, beef carpaccio and lobster stuffed ravioli. Calamari was undercooked. Beef carpaccio was mediocre. Lobster stuffed ravioli was heavy but the sauce was quite tasty. 

Service: terrible. Our server was not knowledgeable about wine at all. When we asked her opinion on these two specific ones we wanted to try, she just said 'it's good, it's really good'. Well, thanks for your input. The whole time we were there, our server was busy chatting with her friends sitting at a table next to us. Never once she came by to top up our wine. We ate, finished the bottle and left.  
With this kind of service, I am not sure who would want to return."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant in a cool part of town!  I loved the exposed brick, original wood floors and wood beams.  The food was super tasty - polenta fries, cheese plate and pizza & the wine selection was great too."}
{"text":"We went to Cibo's about a week ago for lunch with friends, and loved it.  We all got different dishes and everyone was delicious!  And the service was outstanding!  Next time we are in Toronto, we will certainly go back to Cibo's for another yummy experience!"}
{"text":"There is a wall of glass panels enclosing a wine rack that sectioned off the entrance and the inside of the restaurant. An intimate wine bar with an acceptable noise level that's great for awkward first dates. The wooden accents provides a rustic feel also.

I have been here on two occasions. My waiter the first time I've been here was quite the eye-candy for the night. It's quite an extensive Italian menu and I settled for the lobster ravioli. Unfortunately it was very salty and I didn't end up finishing it. However the cocktails were more on the creative and tasty end.

I had a much better experience the second time around. I came here later at night so I got a choice in terms of seating. Again the drinks did not disappoint and I highly recommend their Grilled eggplant, zucchini, roasted peppers, dish with balsamic drizzle. Our waitress the second time around was also very diligent and helpful. 

This place would've earned a higher rating if it wasn't for the disappointing lobster ravioli the first time around, but definitely a thumbs up for their great service and creative cocktails."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place, right from entering this Restaurant We waited before were greeted in unwelcome way, it's like they didn't want us there
Food tasteless, pasta over cook, pizza burnt, branzino it was fishy, we spoke to the lady manager and it seems like she didn't care, when you are on King street there a lots of great choice and for sure Cibo, you are under your league, Italian Restaurant I don't think so, the nice decor doesn't compensate for the horrible food"}
{"text":"Came here for their Sunday brunch. 35 bucks for all you can eat and a mimosa or prosecco. Came here on a wicked Groupon deal and was well worth it.

Great selection of brunch foods. Nice selection of meats. Polenta fries. Rice balls. Omelette bar. Pasta bar. Pizza bar. And my favorite- porchetta. The desert bar had a great selection of cakes and cannolli. 

Food was awesome. Left stuffed. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Came here for their sunday brunch buffet - definitely a bit on the pricey end but all the food was top notch quality and there were tons of tasty options and great variety. Beautiful decor and architecture. High ceilings make for an airy atmostphere. Great venue for a special event!"}
{"text":"Went to Cibo for lunch and they had a special for a starter and entree for something like $18 which was surprisingly great value for a nice place like this. I found both the salad and pasta dish I ate to be really good, though nothing to write home about or anything.

Their bread and chili pepper oils were pretty dope."}
{"text":"Upon arrival, they said I didn't have a reservation even though I had a confirmed email. The hostess was pleasant but suggested that I made it at the wrong location so I checked the confirmation email & I didn't. She said \"luckily we still have a table\" & seated us. The server was erratic (literally totally spaced out & wacky in a very strange way) & messed up our drink order. I asked if all pastas were fresh & she said \"no, but they all taste the same anyway\". Once our meals arrived, she didn't once ask if we were enjoying our meals or if everything was okay. The bread/olives were great but came after our meal; the pasta was HORRID! My spaghetti was undercooked, not al dente & my boyfriend's tagliatelle was overcooked mush. The spicy tomato sauce tasted canned at best & the bolognese was actually embarrassing. It had zero taste. We sent back full plates & the server did not ask what was wrong. Mind you, we never saw the same server twice so there was no consistency. We got the hell out of there! Too bad b/c that space needs another good restaurant & my experience at the King location was good. Ugh, wait for the next restaurant to open here & go to Lil Baci up the street instead."}
{"text":"2.5 stars for Sunday Brunch

My parents are the traditional chinese parents that goes to dim sum every sunday and let me tell you, it was hard to convince my parents to try anything new! I found two good reasons to convince them: 1. my out of town sister came back to visit 2. I found a groupon deal that percieved an awesome value.

Service: Waited 10 mins for seating although there were plenty of vacant seats and I had made prior reservations, I guess they like having a crowded line out the door. I wasn't too impressed by the service since it took our server to serve us water 10 mins after we've been seated and didn't tell me that there were other drink options besides a glass of prosecco (I overheard another server telling another table). As I read other yelp reviews, we weren't given a tour either or any other explanations on the AYCE brunch experience.

Food: I loved the layout of the buffet. It looked amazing but not all that amazing since the foods were all the same but just plated in different sections. I'm no cheese expert but it seemed like they had a table with a variety of cheese. Most of the food served were cold dishes ie. salads, bread, cheese, mussels, very small portions of smoked salmon (wish there were more seafood). Hot foods were made to order pasta (3 kinds), custom pizza, omlettes and the self serve bacon, sausage and poached eggs.

Decor: lots of wood furnishings which created an earthy atmosphere and the glass and open concept created a clean feeling. This location was spacious and the tables were not cluttered which was nice.

I think this created a good memorable experience for my parents but the food were not up to their expectation.

Overall: I don't think I would try it out if it was regularly priced at $35+ tax, driving from sauga+ paid parking. I suggest to get the groupon deal for first timers :)"}
{"text":"Would give them a zero star if it was possible. The service was horrendous. The waitress was extremely rude and complained about being understaffed to us, then she continued to be rude about our own complaints regarding the food (she couldn't understand my friend had a gluten allergy that would cause him to need a hospital). It was my sisters birthday and she found multiple hairs in her pasta and my food was cold as well. Everything tasted as if it was made weeks ago then heated up. 

Worst restaurant experience I have ever had. Save yourself from this restaurant. Never go here."}
{"text":"Only average at best. Pacing of the meal was terrible, we ordered two appetizers and the second one came with our mains.... waitress took our mains back, but just put them under a heat lamp and brought them back 10 minutes later. Food was good overall, room and atmosphere pretty cool, but at this price point there is a lot of competition in the area. They need to be more on their game for me to recommend to anybody."}
{"text":"This place is good for drinks and appetizers for a nice girls night out but for dinner, not so much. I went and we actually returned our food and left to go to another place. 

Atmosphere and vibe is nice. Food isn't."}
{"text":"We were a party of 7. We had a big table and if I recall correctly, we ordered 4 bottles of wine. The wine collection is pretty good, so if you know about wine you can order good stuff. The appetizers are filling enough and tasty. Our total experience was pretty good! We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere. I came here for a late  lunch on a Thursday, we almost had the restaurant to ourselves. We started off with the prosciutto and formaggio - cheese and meat platter. I really enjoyed the variety of meat and cheeses esp the prosciutto and hot salami. For mains we ordered the Taglaitelle pasta (traditional bolognese sauce), rigatoni pasta (Italian sauce, mushroom) and the da Napoli pizza (tomato, garlic and lots of cheese). We really enjoyed the taglaitelle pasta, sauce was rich and flavourful. The pizza was good too, different twist to a margarita pizza. We also had wine which was half off the 5oz (possibly only a lunch special). Overall, the experience was great and the service was even better."}
{"text":"I went there for my birthday with my boyfriend, who had made reservations. This wasn't both of our first times going here, and many of our friends comes and love it. But how disappointed we were... Once sat, we waited 15 minutes without being greeted by our server, so I kindly went to the hostess stand to ask if they could send our server. When she came, there was no apology or anything regarding why she hadn't approached us during that time. (Looking around, it wasn't a packed house or anything). The food was mediocre, and definitly not worth the price whatsoever. We boxed half of it up/didn't eat, nor did the server ask of the quality of the food. No birthday mention or dessert, even though my boyfriend had made a note on the reservation, which shouldn't be that hard when one is easily spending $100+ here, and expecting an experience as well. Very disappointing, safe to say it was our first and last time here, which is too bad."}
{"text":"Chic atmosphere, amazing service and delicious food. It's a busy spot on a Saturday night - reservations necessary. Definitely will return and would recommend. 
Suggestion: buffolo mozz plate, ravioli, chicken parm

A note to the bad reviews here:
I'm really perplexed as to how a few of my fellow yelpers had such a poor experience which results in an overall mediocre score for this resto. 

We almost changed the resto for our friend's birthday bc of these but I'm really glad we didn't! At the end of dinner, I told our fab fob Italian server that the food and her service were both outstanding."}
{"text":"My final word: No one wants a limp pizza. 

My lunch experience: went on a weekday, it was surprisingly busy but they were able to seat my group relatively quickly. Ordered their lunch special which consisted of a salad and pizza. 

The good: the service wasn't bad, and their spinach salad was very nice. 

The bad: I unfortunately have to make a list (it wouldn't be right to give a one star unless I had the chops to back it up) 

The bathroom was disgusting and smelt horrible. 

I caught the server wiping lipstick off a glass with get finger and serving it to another customer. Honestly disgusting. 

There were multiple fruit flies buzzing around our table the whole time. 

My pizza was limp, undercooked and super oily. Bonus plus though, it tasted much better upon a second reheat. 

My lunch cost $40 with wine and tip. The state of this place, the food quality, and the questionable health and safety standards do not justify that price. 

Honestly, I would never ever go back."}
{"text":"First time here but I've heard a lot of good things about this place so I wanted to try it out. By first impressions I was impressed by the ambiance of the restaurant; it has a rustic yet still modern vibe. I really love the lighting; it's a perfect setting for a romantic date or with a group of people. The only thing I didn't like about the seating was that the tables were so close together so I could thoroughly hear everyone's conversations. 

The food was pretty good. My boyfriend got the steak which he really enjoyed. It wasn't cooked to his desire (our server never asked him how he would like his steak) but overall it was good. I got the gnocchi pasta and added a rosé sauce which was also good. I also got a mojito which was sooooo tasty! I could've had like 3 more. My boyfriend got their in house  beer (forgot the name) which was pretty flat, like no foam whatsoever. 

The only thing I didn't like customer service wise was our server. I'm not sure if she was new or something but she was not approachable whatsoever. In a nutshell, she was clueless! She didn't know what beer was on draft or if the restaurant sold mojitos; when asked the size of the steak she responded with \"a decent size,\" and when she came to check up on us, she only asked my boyfriend how he liked his steak and never asked how I liked my food (didn't even make eye contact). My empty mojito glass was also taken away and I was never asked if I wanted another one, which I did (this was someone else). 

To sum up, I'd definitely like to come back to try other things on the menu but I'd hope to have a better server."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Service was terrible.

The management of Cibo Wine bar at King street needs to realize that bad service trumps all good food. I went here with a group of 6 people on Saturday night. The ambiance is trendy and the restaurant was very lively and busy. We made reservations so we were seated promptly. The food overall is okay. You get served a fresh loaf of bread as a starter. For entrees, my husband and I got the funghi pizza ($19) and lobster ravioli ($24). Both were okay. The pizza was a little bit hard to chew and the lobster ravioli was way too salty for my taste. Based on the quality and quantity of what we had, I believe the food is slightly overpriced. 

The biggest issue with our experience was our server. She barely smiled and had a rude and unfriendly demeanour during dinner. At one point, I asked her a question and she literally interrupted me before I had a chance to finish my question with her response being super impolite. Unbelievable. We basically had very little interaction/exchange with her until the very end when we had to pay for the bill. Even then it was just a mere \"here's the machine\" and \"thank-you\".

Verdict: I will never return to this location of Cibo. I have been to other Cibo locations for brunch and have never had such an experience."}
{"text":"Horrible, came in on a quiet Monday night. The host seated us by a pass and where we listened to a manager yell at staff which was very awkward. My pasta was hard and luke warm, they brought the wrong dish to my friend replaced it with the correct dish but it was overly salted, about five minutes later the manager brought back the pasta but it was still overly salted. I hate people who complain to get free food but they could have at least taken her pasta off the bill. I called the next day and the hostess hung up on me.
I have never ever written a review online but this was one of the worst experiences, especially for the prices."}
{"text":"New Yonge Street location - dined July 4. Bad experience beginning to end. Reserved a table at the window overlooking the patio. When greeted by hostess, they had no note of table just a reservation.Staff are young and inexperienced at attending to customers in a higher end restaurant.  Bathrooms were a mess. Soap pouring out of an over sized dispenser onto a soap dish - overflowing onto the vanity. Something you would expect to see in a low end economy restaurant. Garbage overflowing with paper towel.

Waited too long for server to take our drink order. We ordered sparkling water and lime/lemon. Water arrived with no lemon when we asked the server again, she returned to the table holding two lemons in her hand!

Food took a long time - it was a Saturday evening. We ordered the arugla salad. Dressing had little flavour. Steak skewers were dry and served with bread ????. Orecchiette under cooked and had little flavour. Our martinis tasted like kool aid. We couldn't get out of the restaurant fast enough. Overpriced for quality of food and service.

Hopefully it will improve as they work out the kinks. The venue is well decorated, great location and we love the other Cibo locations. Sadly this one doesnt rank anywhere near those."}
{"text":"I have had my eye on this place for a while now and I finally managed to take the drive to midtown for lunch today! There's parking in front on Yonge street and a bunch of parking lots near by, but if you want free parking, you can drive a little bit down on the side streets for 1 hour of free parking.

I didn't have a reservation, but for just 2 people at 2pm on a Monday, it was very empty. We were seated right away near the bar. This is a beautiful place with high ceilings and a second floor. There's a display of wine bottles and cute lights that hang from the ceiling. After we ordered, they brought some house made bread with chilli oil and olives. That was a nice surprise!

We ordered spaghetti with meatballs ($19) and the Margherita pizza ($13). Service was very fast and attentive. Our waitress came around with pepper and mozzarella and refilled our waters without having to ask her. I didn't try the spaghetti, but I really enjoyed the margherita pizza - super thin but loaded with cheese! Next time I hope to try a pizza with more toppings, as this one was quite plain. I had a $25 gift certificate (to be applied after tax), so our total came up to $11 without tip. Not bad for an authentic Italian lunch!"}
{"text":"I know it's King West, but even for King West the prices are way too high.  Even with high prices, I'd suck it up for a 5star food experience, but it just wasn't.  I started with the arrancini balls, a personal favourite of mine.  Theirs were extremely dry and not very flavourful.  I had to bathe it in the marinara sauce to make it tasty.  The pasta I ordered was \"Meh\" - it was one of the homemade ones with a tomato sauce (sorry!).  
The highlight was the rosemary bread they give complimentary.  It was DELICIOUS and set me up to be disappointed with the rest of the meal's mediocrity.  
I sat at the bar, and the woman that served me was actually great, probably keeping it from a 2-star review due to the amount of overpriced wine I tried due to her attentive service.   Unfortunately, probably won't be back."}
{"text":"In town for Centennial Classic Outdoor games. 

Stopped in for drinks with the wife before heading to our NYE dinner elsewhere.

Let's just say our limited time here was not the best.

Sat at the bar,  as did the family of gnats.   One was in my wife's drink when it was brought and no one seemed to care when we mentioned how plentiful they were.

 (New drink was brought).

Paid our bill and left."}
{"text":"Hot spot on King Street West if you like to dress up, drink wine and look good doing so. 

The restaurant is pretty big but you can tell they tried to squeeze in as many tables as possible inside. Love the fresh pasta section on the left, the glass wine room and there's knowledgable servers who have all the answers to any menu Qs you ponder about. 

This place gets really busy early lunch and late evening. Safe hour is around 4-5pm (weekdays) 

Dinner: 

Spinach Salad w/ dried figs, Brie, oranges, pine nuts, cranberries, capellini crisps in a strawberry vinaigrette ($14)
Organic Mixed Greens w/ sautéed shrimp, cherry tomatoes, lemon and extra virgin olive oil. ($14)
Risotto w/ porcini mushrooms ($19)
Ravioli w/ sundried tomatoes, pine nuts, aged ricotta cheese, Sicilian pesto in rose sauce ($19)

Portions are huge, everything is fresh, love fine Italian dining. I wish I wore loose fitted clothes because even if you are full and there's leftovers, you..just..can't put that fork down..must finish it haha"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Very slow . Cold coffee. Only one bartender working on a Saturday night. Every place on King had line ups....it was slow here. ..on a Saturday night it should be rammed. In my opinion it us being run totally wrong. Get better coctails, a dj and make this place come alive...it's a beautiful place and should be busier!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night with a couple of friends to catch up and have some fun. I got there a bit earlier but still waited 10 mins to be asked what I'd like to drink. Little did I know that this would be foreshadowing the rest of the evening.   

By the time the rest of our party arrived the timing seemed to get slower and slower. Our waiter who didn't seem to be working one of the busier section didn't make a lasting impression, and we didn't seem to either. We had asked for our checks only for him to come back with a dessert menu. 

I can usually forgive bad service if the food makes up for it but this was not the case. I ordered the arrancini to start with and it arrived somewhat cold with bland seasoning. I was disappointed but was hoping my main would make up for it.... it didn't. I ordered the risotto with mixed seafood, and the menu didn't specify what kind of sauce the dish came with, which I will admit was my fault. I was expecting something light in taste but what arrived instead was boxed rice with canned sauce. 

Needless to say I won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"The interior of this establishment is lovely- it would be suitable for many different types of occasions. It was very busy and lively as well.

The bread and olives provided were really nice and we were already wondering why the reviews were so mixed on Yelp. We were planning to come back again. 

However, things got a bit rocky after this. We had ordered the proscuitto+formaggio charcuterie, Margherita pizza, seafood linguine with fresh pasta, and affogato. The charcuterie selection was okay. The selection of cheeses wasn't very pleasant to us- it was two hard and very strong bitter cheeses and one that was slightly softer and less strong; there was also a large chunk of parmesan. We were pretty shocked to find that their Margherita pizza was just a cheese pizza with 4 pieces of basil. It was cooked ok on the top but was soggy on the bottom and it was not a Margherita pizza. The pasta was also okay. The fresh pasta and the flavour of the sauce were both nice- the portion size is a bit small. The clams tasted good but were overcooked. Our first affogato actually had some weird bits in it and we found a sizable piece of plastic. They replaced it with a new one. The second one tasted good- I wasn't very fond of the chocolate pieces in it since they were in the cold dessert their texture became waxy. 

Aside from this, the service from the waitresses and waiters was quite good. Most of the staff members were very nice and helpful. But a large reason for why we probably won't return, at least to this location, was because the manager responded rudely to something my partner was trying to explain- he was quite angry about this.

Overall, you're paying for the ambiance. Perhaps just going to the bar or brunch would be better but we'll be going somewhere else if we want Italian food for dinner."}
{"text":"This place just became one of my top places for brunches. Being a fan of brunch, I was blown away by this place. They offer so much variety that if you will leave the place craving for more. They have an a la carte pasta station, egg station, fresh waffles and loads of dessert options to offer. Even though the place is a tad bit expensive than other breakfast/brunch places, it is worth the spend!"}
{"text":"I have been to Cibo Wine Bar (King location) multiple times, and it has been consistent in terms of food quality and service. The ambiance is wonderful, and each order has been delicious. Really tasty pizza and appetizers, as well as squid. Went here for my boyfriends birthday dinner and their dessert (tiramisu) was lovely too. Wide selection of wines and very fine tasting."}
{"text":"Chicken parm was really good! Not the best I've ever had, but really quite yummy. Great atmosphere and good for actually having a conversation over dinner :) would recommend for the food!
Unfortunately we didn't have the friendliest waiter while there, but it happens. Didn't overwhelmingly damper the experience there"}
{"text":"Been here 5 times for their Sunday brunch, mostly thanks to Groupon. 

It's nice, I wish they still did their champagne specials. The fruits are always fresh and delicious. Bread... meh for an italian place but now they started to bring out fresh baked with rosemary and a nice chili oil. 

The hot carve station of lamb was a nice new addition but the meat itself was meh, very fatty cuts and not seasoned well enough. 

The polenta fries and aracini balls are always a hit for me. The made to order wood oven pizza was delicious!

Omelette station, fresh pasta and fresh cannolis are a plus :)

Desserts.... drool!

Service is pretty good as well! I might try their dinner menu one time!"}
{"text":"Ive been to this location twice and the eglinton location once for their Sunday Italian brunch.

The offerings are amazing!!! Fresh made to order eggs (omelets and benedicts with italian antipasto toppings), fresh wood oven pizzas made to order, polenta fries, risotto balls, fresh made to order salads and pastas... meat and cheese boards and more!

The brunch also comes with a nice glass of prosseco or mimosa. 

The first 2 times were so good, i think the setup at the eglinton location is smaller but nicer. The king location is bigger but the seating is a bit uncomfortable. 

Our bar table this time was very wobbly and the service was really off. They didn't have our reservations when we arrived. They didn't show us the stations even though for other groups ahead of us and after we can see them walking them through the different areas. 

Every time we came back with more food, our old plates from a round or two ago were still not cleared even though the tables next to us were up kept. I had to flag down a server at one point because I had no more space to put anything down and no one had stopped by since the beginning of the meal.

I got the eggs benedict and the egg was more than hard boiled, but the omelet was good. Definitely try their polenta fries (I think this is what keeps me going back)!!!

We had to again flag a server down for water half way through the meal. A lot of this should be pretty basic at any restaurant let alone a wine bar. Finally waved our bill down and it was the wrong bill... I just walked up to a waitress instead because our parking was about to expire. 

She fixed it up and apologized. I would go back to the Eglinton location again but probably not the King st one again."}
{"text":"Went here Saturday. Ordered insalata di mare, lobster ravioli, and seafood linguini.

The food was ok. I can't say I was blown away by anything. Just typical Italian fare. The service was ok. Waiter coming around when not needed and not available when needed. The atmosphere was nice, lively, and not too loud. 

So in sum, this is an ok Italian."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday night at 6:30 with a party of 11 of us. The hostess took us to a table upstairs, which I indicated would be extremely difficult for my 85 year old mother with her bad knees. This is a very large restaurant and there were a very significant number of empty tables on the main floor that would easily have accommodated our party. I spoke with the manager who refused to move us downstairs. He said we should have requested the main floor, but as we had never been to the restaurant there would be no way of knowing they had seating on two floors. During the 2 1/2 hours it took them to serve us our meals a large number of empty tables on the main floor remained empty. While our server was very attentive, it did not compensate for what turned out to be for most of us, very bland, tasteless food.  Next time we are in the area we will go to La Vecchia, where the food, and most certainly the service are far superior."}
{"text":"Recommend: tiger shrimp, polenta fries, chianti braised short rib, lobster ravioli!"}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious 2017! 
Food: baked eggplant and mushroom pizza, I highly recommend. I also tried the trout chocolate ravioli which were both underwhelming. 

I like the ambiance, decor, vibe, and service of CIBO a lot! But I feel like their menu is a hit or a miss. And I've been to a separate location and same - some things really amazing, other items kinda terrible. You really have to know what to order!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I particularly enjoyed the Diavola pizza (with arugula instead of red peppers)! We also had the porcini mushroom risotto and the lobster-stuffed ravioli, and finished our dinner with the vanilla panna cotta. 

A few things about our visit that wasn't so satisfactory - portions could have been bigger for the risotto and ravioli, considering how pricey they were. As well, the ravioli was cold by the time it arrived at our table. Service was almost non-existent. Our server seemed to favour other tables more (there was a table with an older group) and he almost seemed to be avoiding eye contact with us whenever we tried to get his attention (we only ever did for ordering our food and for the bill). He didn't once ask us how our food was. Needless to say, we were not pleased with the service. Perhaps it was just this particular location that had bad service? Hopefully service would be much better when I come in for a visit again."}
{"text":"I would also give them a zero star if I could. Went there this weekend with some friends for Summerlicious and received literally the worst service I have ever received. The waiter attended to other tables first despite our table having arrived before, he didn't offer bread until we asked, our meal ended up being 2 hours for no reason, and not only that but when this other waitress was cleaning the table next to us, she ended up spraying us with the cleaning solution all over us, which was definitely a mistake, but just felt like the cherry on top of the most horrendous service ever. The appetizers were good, but the mains were terrible, I could make better pasta than what we got served there and I am a terrible cook. I would discourage ANYONE from going to Cibo, EVER! Will never ever be going back, ugh what a waste of time, money, and calories."}
{"text":"Oh, Cibo.  How does one write a review when in general, the place is pretty good, but then there's this one really bad experience...?

My general review of Cibo is that it is a solid 3 stars.  The pastas are delicious and I have enjoyed the antipasti, polenta fries and salads many times.  If you like pizza, well, that's usually pretty good to.  Nothing is mind-blowing, but generally, it's good.

Today, I'm giving Cibo two stars (it would have been one star, if not for what I wrote above).  I visited with a larger party of 13 people.  I ordered the italian club sandwich.  It arrived without the pesto.  I notified the waitress and she went to go and get some.  She was gone FOREVER. Once she returned, almost everyone was close to finished.  It was then that I noticed there was also no pancetta on my sandwich.  She told me she'd have a new one made for me.  Seeing as we were almost done, I asked for it to be packed to go.

I sat there for over 1.5 hours, waiting for food and then watching my companions eat.  When the sandwich was ready, a manager (presumably), brought it down to my table.  He also brought a complimentary dessert.  While a nice gesture, I don't personally want a piece of cheesecake while my insides are dying from hunger.

So, I was expected to pay for this sandwich, which I thought was really terrible service.  I am now back at the office, and I unwrapped my sandwich only to find an unacceptable amount of chicken.  See photo.

Cibo, this is a total fail.  On top of all of this, the waitress was super crusty and unfriendly.  She also failed to mention to the entire table that gratuity was included (servers, you should always be clear.  Most of us know, but there is always someone who doesn't).  This resulted in the server getting extra tips from people, unwarranted, IMO.  

Meh."}
{"text":"When traveling through Toronto, we wanted to find a great spot for a weeknight \"Date Night\" and we just so happened upon Cibo.  And let's face it.. in my book.. anything that has the words \"wine bar\" in the name.. I'm sold!   **On a side note - I had no idea this place had a few locations and was super stoked to find out that there is one (or a few) so close to home.  Score!  

Located on busy King Street, there is not a designated parking area - you will have to park a block or two away, go for street parking (if available) or uber/taxi your way there.  

As soon as you walk in, you will notice how gorgeous this space is - A fab rustic look that immediately has me hooked.  I love the combo of wood and wrought iron - So modern and so chic.  Keep walking and you will find this gorgeous \"wine cellar\" encased in glass that spans two floors.. Two. Floors!  My initial thought.. How do I get one of these in my place?!

Back to reality.. We were greeted right away with a cheerful smile and upbeat hello.. the perfect way to walk into a new restaurant.  It seemed quite busy (they were even hosting a private event) but we were seated right away with a great view of the open kitchen (perfect spot to see them rolling out the handmade pizza dough).  Our waitress was exactly what I look for:  sweet, attentive and recommended the perfect wines for us to try.  After taking our orders, she let us relax and enjoy our time there - popping in every so often to be sure we were ok but not hovering over us - she was there exactly when needed and that made the experience that much more enjoyable.  

What a great menu!  How was I suppose to decide with so many fantastic sounding options?!  Right off the bat, we both decided that we just had to try the Polenta Fries - they arrived perfectly crispy with two especially tasty dipping sauces - marinara and gorgonzola.  If you like polenta fries (and you would be crazy not to).. these are a must!  Complimentary rosemary bread is also served with an awesome chili oil.. this bread just may be the best bread you will ever have!  Then.. after debating between pasta, a cheese plate, risotto or baked eggplant.. I had to go with the pasta - and after the first fork-full.. it was love at first bite!  More on my dish in a second.  My fiancé opted for the Gnocchi - with ricotta and a gorgonzola cream sauce - so buttery and simply melts in your mouth.  Needless to say.. he enjoyed each and every scrumptious bite.  As for me, I ordered the Gigli - Yum-O!!  Perfectly cooked al dente spiral pasta with prosciutto, cherry tomatoes, zucchini, black olives, bocconcini and basil - This dish was absolutely amazing with each bite being better than the next.  Filling but not overly so.. the perfect portion size.  Totally crave worthy!  Just thinking about it is making me want it again this very second.. Hmm.. I wonder if they deliver?!  

The location in Toronto had me sold on Cibo.. Can't wait to check out the ones nearby!  **Another side note.. I knew I was sold when I opened the Wine menu and on the front page it says:  \"Life is too short to drink bad wine\" - My Yelp tag line!!  It's like this place was made for me!!"}
{"text":"Great food and locale, but the service is lacking. On the first visit (we were a group of 5 ladies), our server was slow, distant, and he seemed as if he could not get away from our table fast enough. Had to bite my tongue not to call the manager over! On my second visit, the waitress, again, paid little attention to our table. Would visit again for the food, hoping for a \"third time's the charm\" in service!!"}
{"text":"Ordered from their summerlicious dinner menu (Yes, this review is way overdue.)

Appetizer: Shrimp. Was probably best part of the meal. The shrimp were perfectly cooked - very juicy. The tomato sauce was surprisingly spicy but was delicious! 4/5

Entrée: Trout. The trout was bland, but the veggies that came with it were very flavourful. 3/5 

Dessert: Cheesecake martini. Pretty good but wasn't feeling the balsamic that was drizzled on top of it. 3/5

Service: The service was quite slow. One of our party members didn't receive her appetizer with the rest, and by the time it came, everyone else had already finished theirs. 3/5

When it came time for entrees, the manager came by and said there was a miscommunication and that our order would be delayed and that he's \"very very very very very very very very very sorry\". Promised he would do something for us to make up for it, but nothing came of this promise. The apology itself was odd and unprofessional. 

One party member got her entree right away and the rest didn't come for another 20 minutes or so. 

When it was time to pay the bill, the server told us they don't split bills and that she confirmed that with the manager. I've never heard of this before. We had to do the math ourselves and tell the server what amounts to charge each person.

I wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"I have been here once for dinner and about 5 times for lunch as I work in the area. The food is decent, and I think that the lunch special where you get to pick a salad as well as a pasta or pizza is a great deal and has some good options. The restaurant is also beautifully designed. It's the service I really have a problem with, honestly I don't know what is up with the servers there. Have they ever heard of service with a smile? They always seem to be rushing you and in a bad mood, and every time you need something they seem annoyed. It's strange because we have had different servers every time and they all have the same attitude! I'd suggest going to Grazie down the street instead, the servers there are fantastic and so is the food."}
{"text":"A disappointment. Took my mom here for her birthday and the food was not worth the price. The ambience is nice but also a little loud. We were also right by the kitchen area. The only upside was after one of our meals was messed up our server brought a plate of three mini desserts to make up for it."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. We rented a private room for a corporate event and was asked to prepay for a deposit. No problem, you would think they would schedule ahead of time for the party with the set menu.

We had a tiny room that was no joke 35 degrees and filled with candles. We asked about 10 times for the heat to be turned down. Two of our 4 appetizers came out within 30 minutes then silence for about an hour. Then they told us the mains were coming. They completely forgot about our appetizers, the mains were all scattered in timing, my fish was so salty. 

To apologize after the manager came down, she claimed she didn't know what was going on. If you were doing your job, you would. Then our server came in like a club girl yelling \"prosecco!\". This is a corporate audience and not bottle service. It was highly inappropriate.

We had another function and rebooked elsewhere. Terrible ambiance, service and food. Don't go."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very large and quite attractive in a lively part of town. Our servers were very friendly and attentive. Our salad starters were average to good. Unfortunately it was downhill after that. I have an unhealthy addiction to spaghetti carbonara. I've ordered it countless times in countless restaurants. This spaghetti carbonara was easily the worst I've ever had. Overly al dente  spaghetti in a pool of sweet milk with sparse pancetta.  My wife's tagliatelle tasted like noodles mixed in Campbell's cream of mushroom soup. The menu is quite extensive and I'm sure there are some winners in there but I personally wouldn't order another dinner here.
Would probably stop in again for appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"Where Shark Club and Italy meet for Sunday brunch

We live in the neighbourhood and would definitely end up here, but the Groupon offer was the nudge we needed. It lowered the risk since we already have our neighbourhood favourites.

We arrived on time for our reservation and were \"greeted\" by 4 hostess that were just hanging out at the front. The restaurant was packed, but apparently they could spare half hour chilling out at the front while patrons were looking for a good experience plp.

We finally got a table, but it took over 15 minutes for someone to just come by and offer us water, forget the mimosas that were part of the Groupon or having someone explain how the brunch stations worked. It didn't take us long to understand that they've squeezed as many tables as possible to make the place profitable while forgetting to hire and train the staff to match the upscale hipster family-friendly environment they are trying to convey.

30 minutes later and after asking if we could just go and serve ourselves, the mimosas and coffees we've ordered were nowhere to be seen. But how bad can this could get? Oh, wait, I'm forgetting to talk about the food!

Cibo is an Italian restaurant that would make any Italian national want to abdicate their citizenship. From the selection of dry and chewy prosciutto to the cheese-less arancini to the mushy cannoli to  the day old chocolate croissants (I don't know for sure if they were a day old but they sure tasted like it), everything was very disappointing. The cheese selection is OK, and the fruits are sweet, however, anything that you'd expect a restaurant to cook was mediocre.

The service is awful at this location. Dishes pile up on tables while sweaty bussers try to match customers' expectations and hostess in high heels run around trying to help in organizing the chaos somehow. There's no consistency in how the food stations are managed and items will stay out until they dry out.

Overall, definitely not worth the $35/person charged for the brunch buffet. I doubt I'll go back in the evening for dinner. And next time I'm looking to spend more on Sunday brunch, I'll just head to Collette at the Thompson. But hey, I did get to watch one of the hostess hanging from the wine cellar ceiling while I was there... That should've been enough, right?"}
{"text":"The food was ok. The server messed up our order a couple of times. Not that great of a service."}
{"text":"This place was like Hooters with classier girls wearing more clothes. But don't get me wrong all their clothes were very tight!, even though I'm queer I couldn't help but stare wow lol, I'd definately hop the fence for these
Girls, not the kind of place you'd want to go with your family because I'm sure you'd have to pic your fathers jaw up off the ground or your husband. But I'm sure ladies if you want your man to dish out on an expensive wine and lobster. He'll do it here! 

Honestly I felt the charcuterie board was pretty delicious and reasonable for the price and one of the lovely girls recommended I get the riesling even though I don't like Riesling because it was a very nice drop. She was right!  Now that's good product knowledge. 

I also got the squid and the carpaccio. All was very nicely blended!"}
{"text":"It's a huge place, quite busy with a lot of 20 year olds. Cool decor inside - lots of personality.
Went for a private party, where we received okay service.
For food, we tried: 
-Pepperoni pizza (good, spicey)
-fried polenta (crispy, sorta bland like polenta is)
-tomatoes on bread (okay, not that good)
-Caprese salad (3 slices tomato, giant chunk mozzarella)
-Baked calamari (bland)
-Ahi tuna on sauce (bland, no pepper, sauce flavorful, not warm)
The wine wasn't great, but had alcohol, and that's was really matters"}
{"text":"I live very close by and eat lots of fine dining, so was excited to try a new spot. Unfortunately after viewing the wine prices we decided not to stay. We drink cave springs dolomite when we can find it, and often order this wine at Crush wine bar across the street. It's about $40-45 at crush, so when we saw $65 at Cibo we just walked right out. Their beers are $14 on tap, and all drinks/wine was very overpriced. This is coming from someone who spent $500 at George a couple weeks ago for dinner for two. 

Honestly, that's rude. We left on principle and this restaurant needs to get their selves together or they will go out of business very fast."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. We had the polenta fries, steak skewers and shared a pizza. All very tasty, as was the fresh bread. Place was lively. Loud, but in a positive way; we could steal hear each other. Service was very good. Our server was very knowledgeable about wines and made great recommendations that match our personal preferences. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Disappointing,105 degrees upstairs, young server that had no experience. He made us feel bad for complaining about the heat he said \"think how I feel about the heat I'm the one running around\". The food was great but the service and heat where terrible. They did try and comp us for the heat, the server offered free desert to our entire party of 6. Two of the people left because the heat was so terrible. The sever came back almost instantly and said \" so I see two of the party have left that will only be 4 deserts now?\" I found this extremely cheesy of him to run over and say that. The house was providing the deserts, the expense was not coming out of his tip money. At a high class restaurant I wouldn't expect that kind of cheap behaviour. By the time we got the bill it totalled up to 400$ roughly. We asked to have the bill split after the fact of getting the bill. We where not offered to have the bill split, he simply brought it over to us with out confirming anything. Being a table of couples you would think the server would assume the table would want the bill split. When we asked to split it he made a huge deal saying it would take at least 20 minutes to split the bill. 20 minutes ?! I have worked in the industry and I know that splitting a bill does not take 20 minutes. We accepted the fact that we had to split it between us, payed bill and left. If you go to the young and eg location do not sit up stairs and expect slow inexperienced service."}
{"text":"Dropped by Cibo on a nice summer night and had a blast ! Besides the actual restaurant being stunning and the food immaculate, the thing that separates Cibo from its surrounding competition is its superb service.
      Morgan the manager personally introduced himself to us and made us feel more then at home ! Attentive and professional this is the spot to eat for authentic Italian cuisine in Yorkville."}

{"text":"My girlfriends and I purchased on Groupon a few months ago a pass to have brunch at Cibo for only $17. It sounded well worth it for a buffet.

We reached the destination and were greeted by friendly and polite hostess' who showed us to our seats. I love the décor in Cibo as it has a Classy Rustic style. Light wooden floors and tables with rusty colored brown leather seating. The lighting  in Cibo also highlighted food areas. Our waitress instantly brought us each a glass of Perseco bubbly which came with our breakfast voucher. 

We started at the omelette making station where they had the options of adding regular omelette options with a few extra twists such as marinated herb spiced peppers, Italian ground sausage, and caramelized onions. My omelette/scrambled eggs turned out delicious I must say. My only issue with the omelette station was the area where you pick up bacon/sausage and potato's. They had it cooked in this huge steaming machine, but it wasn't opened so you had to lift it yourself and burn yourself! Me and my girlfriends tried a few times until we had to ask for someone to open it and have it propped so that people don't burn themselves trying to access the food.

They also had a cheese table with gouda, parmesan, mozzarella and I think white cheddar. They had brie beside bowls of honey and walnuts...I drizzed those bad boys on my brie and it was soooo delicious! A cold meats deli section was set up beside the cheese with Prosciutto, spicy salami and a few other regular selections like turkey and ham. Beside that table was a fresh bread and croissant basket with peanut butter, jam and butter spread.

I went back for my second plate of food to get this Mexican rice concoction that had melted cheese over it, some amazing risotto balls and some shrimp in marinara sauce. I have to say, the shrimp although cooked tasted under cooked, and didn't have much flavor. It could have had some black pepper and salt or maybe even some herb seasoning.

The had a pizza station where a chef was making whatever pizza you choose and putting it in a wood fired oven. MMMM that tasted just amazing! I also ate from the pasta station where you had your choice of fresh pasta cooked with either Red, White or Rose sauce. I chose the white sauce and added my own fresh ingredients by choice. It tasted soooo good!

I strongly recommend you save the Pizza and Pasta station for last b/c they are BIG servings for a buffet. The pasta dish was as big as a lunch portion at a regular restaurant and the pizza easily had 6 slices even though it's thin crust. If you eat those first, you probably won't have enough room for anything else. I couldn't eat all mine. 

Such a great experience, beautiful venue and scrumdiddlyumcious food!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. I visited on a Saturday night around 9 pm. They had a party coming in so we had to sit in the \"lounge\" area. 

The server we had took forever to take our order the people who came in after us got their food drinks and Bill before us. And she made us feel like we were bugging her.  We both ordered pasta so I asked for cheese which normally that's what restaurants offer you when you get pasta she said \"we usually don't offer cheese with seafood\" .... Lol what? I don't care I asked for cheese just go get the cheese.

We made the unfortunate mistake of ordering  the fries. We thought it would be potato fries it wasn't. I have no idea what it was but it taste horrible. The waiter did take it off our bill though. The clam linguine with wine sauce underwhelming barely any flavor. The shrimp fettuccine was really good.  The Moscato was amazeballs."}
{"text":"Wow, tough crowd to please but I was extremely impressed with Cibo. Went on a Friday night at 7 and scored a seat at the bar immediately! Customer service was amazing, the bartenders were super friendly and helpful in deciding what to order. We were so entertained by the way their wines are setup and the different temperatures they were stored at. We ended up getting a bottle of wine so not sure how the cocktails are. 
Food: we got a salad and pizza and everything was absolutely delicious and fresh. 
I would definitely come back here for happy hour to check out the menu, and for dinner."}
{"text":"Came here on a dinner date prior to some work drinks across the street @ Spice Route.
Cibo is an upscale Italian restaurant along this stretch of King street west.  Upon entering the ambiance is chilled out, intimate and definitely classy. However during dinner time it the noise level can be quite high. 
My date and I sat in the bar lounge area and decided to order a bottle of red (malbec). Our server was extremely polite and provided us some recommendations. In terms of food we decided to try their popular gourmet pizza. The Presentation was nice, the price was reasonable, and overall experience was great. Would this be a go to Italian restaurant? Perhaps if there isn't anything in the area, and if you're into upscale Italian food."}
{"text":"Both my grilled calamari and steak was over cooked. Very long wait times
For food, awful server. I would continue to go to the venue because I enjoy the clientele it attracts. Yet I wouldn't reserve for dinner again."}
{"text":"This place is quite busy on a Tuesday night. We made reservations for 8:45pm and when we got there the restaurant was 80% full! Our waitress was polite but she walked past our table at least five times and never refilled our water until we asked. Anyhow onto the food. Food was disappointing. I was really excited about their Lobster Tuesday special. However all the lobsters came out with a mushy texture, definitely a let-down. Not to mention the food took almost an hour to arrive and the dishes were cold! Not sure if I will be back."}

{"text":"A coworker of mine recommended this place. It was close by my work (within 5 mins walk). She raved about it so I decided to give it a try. 

Walking in made me felt like a casual dining place, for drinks with coworkers, dinner with friends.. the usual.. 

We were greeted and seated in a timely manner, although it was busy during the holiday season. They didn't compromise on the service. 

Once we sat down,  they asked if we wanted sparkling water or tap. We opt in for sparkling, not realizing it was $5 a bottle. The warm bread with balsamic vinegar and olive oil was yummy...and olives...it did seem to taste different from other places but I don't know how to describe it.. 

Anyways, on to the appys and entrees. We ordered the salad with blue cheese, linguine with fresh clams and white sauce, and one in tomato sauce. Unfortunately, mine didn't really feel like white wine sauce... it felt like my pasta was dreaded in olive oil...towards the end, I couldn't even finish it...

So I went back to work and my coworker was like.. Noo! Why did you order pasta...you should have ordered the pizza cuz it was to die for...wasn't aware of that beforehand so didnt have the same experience as she did.   

I may go back and give the pizza a try...depends..."}
{"text":"I had the chance to try Cibo and really enjoyed it. 

The beer selection is extensive with Ontario's own Beau's Lug Tread and the Tom Green Beer on tap, along with other standard brands.

I had the pizza and it was incredible, nice thin crust pizza, which was nice and hot. 

I'd definitely come to Cibo again."}
{"text":"Have been three times now with friends and the food has been consistently good. Okay, consistent but for one dessert we had during summerlicious which was clearly made at least a day ahead and suffered terribly for it. Service has also been good. Love the large and surprisingly vegetarian-friendly menu. And the fact that you can easily get a reservation for 4-6 people without calling a month in advance and pledging your first-born (a near impossibility in that neck of the woods)."}
{"text":"Lovely upscale vibe, the Yorkville location is beautiful- the downstairs is a private area if you want to have a group dinner (birthday party).  The main floor and upper level have tables/booths with beautiful lighting.  A nice girls night out or date spot.

It's Yorkville so expect higher prices and smaller portions.  We ordered the Buffalo pizza and the lobster ravioli to share as we just wanted a small bite before heading off to the ROM

I must say I was impressed with the lobster ravioli- it's rare to find a lobster dish where you can actually taste the lobster but this dish the lobster rang through the heavy cream sauce.  

The pizza was ok - nothing particularly special about it - a pizza is about 8 or so slices so definitely shareable.

The vibe is really nice and the service I can't complain about.  I'd come back if I were in the area - of course the wine/drink list is interesting:)

Ciao from Cibo!"}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise after the horrid experience at their Yorkville location. 
We managed to make it to their famous Sunday Brunch and found it to be wonderful.
Fresh fruit, omelet station, waffle station, pastas, warm foods, cheese/meat as well as dessert were all laid out on the first floor, the restaurant is gorgeous, the service staff exceptional and the food...is ok.
The ambience is deserving of 5/5
The staff is deserving of 4/5 (Kitchen told my friend who is lactose intolerant there was no cheese, cream in a pasta dish. Had he eaten more of it...he would have painted your walls in it as he threw up. We check with our waiter who returned after he had eaten 2 bites and told us there was cream. Thank heavens. You need to be careful with allergies and lactose intolerance. Tisk)

The food was a 3/5.
Fruit was wonderful, breads a bit dry, omelet a tad bit burnt but I prefer my eggs scrambled anyways, bacon and cured meat/cheese were delicious. The desserts were lovely but far too sweet. In all they have a lovely variety and the discounted wines on Sunday made for a wonderful experience. Moscato was simply delicious as was the sparkling water.

Overall this location is well deserving of 4 stars.
We shall return to sample more items."}
{"text":"Truly the first restaurant to be fully deserving of a negative star rating, but even Yelp is not that unkind.

This is sadly just a review of the consistent failures presented to us within 5mins of entering the establishment, as I opted to save myself further stress and indignation and leave without having a meal here.

I arrived at 1:27p.m. for Brunch with two friends, unfortunately 12 mins past our reservation time of 1:15p.m.. However they were willing to seat us due to this horrendous tardiness on our part *Note sarcasm* (We were stuck in the freezing cold, warring with the pay and park machine which only took coins or credit card and would eject the credit card until we were forced to allocate change). The Hostess was kind enough to ask if the seating in the bar, with high chairs and tables would be \"ok\", She never truly expected me to say \"No it's not ok, I am in a short dress and 4 inch heels\" You could at this point see the world about her crumble, as she had no idea how to actually deal with me refusing the seating arrangement. I asked her why they would take a reservation and then within less that 15mins of the booking give away my table? 
Without another word she ran off to speak with the other hostess seated at the laptop, who called out from where she was sitting that our reservation was for 1:15p.m. As the 2nd Hostess returned, I asked her once more if there were any other options, she stated no and progressed to lead us to the bar area, I at this point refused to continue with this and told her thank you but no, I was then met with a rather nasty snarky remark of \" Well good luck with that\" beautiful and professional service from an establishment in Yorkville no less.
My guests and I at this point left, as if they could not even hold a reservation for 15mins there was no point in enduring this location further. 
We returned to the car and I called to speak to the manager, I was met with a voice mail, left on hold a second time for 5 mins and so on. My boyfriend at this point called to find out what the issue was, and the Hostess then stated my name and said \"Oh this is the 'name' party\" He said yes and was put through to a male who informed us that our reservation was at 12:15... REALLY? A restaurant unable to actually make a reservation and the manager on site and the Hostess having different times? I suspected this level of unethical conduct was perhaps commonplace at this restaurant at this point.. to lie to your patrons.
Not only were they unable to actually seat us, when there was a table at the bottom of the stairs that we could see was empty and could seat up to 12 guests, but taking the correct time for a reservation was beyond their ability. He continued his condescending apology and stated \"Well if you had waited 5 mins, other seats were available and opening up. Half our restaurant was closed\" NOT only did his Hostess refuse any other options when asked, but had frankly dismissed us in a haughty manner with added bonus of a nasty comment. All I received from this gentleman was an arrogant apology without a solution, at this point we left the area and proceeded to have lunch elsewhere. 
This experience from a Yorkville establishment, that tries to project an upscale image? I was disappointed yet relieved to never be compelled to return. 
Perhaps, if they trained their staff on how to take correct reservations and how to communicate with patrons they would have scored higher and be at the level of a basic McDonald's. 
After reading the other reviews posted on Yelp, I am glad we didn't stay. Unethical, consistently incompetent behaviour should never be rewarded and this seems to be the standard of this Cibo location.
I caution you before choosing this location, staff are lacking and as one reviewer said \"It's lipstick on a pig\" with their renovations. Your restaurant might look good, but your service and food is what makes you exceptional... yet your establishment has failed at the very basics of service, I shudder to think what your food is like.

For a good brunch experience with servers who know what they are doing, and for exquisite food I suggest Sunday Brunch at the Omni, well worth it...

Updated 16/10/2016 - I suggest their Yonge and Eglington location. Service is superior to their Yorkville train wreck."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, great location but disappointed with the food. I have been to the King St location and never had a bad meal, was sadly disappointed with the food at the Yonge St location.   The apps looked delicious but had no taste, and yet the mains were so full of salt they were uneatable.  I hope this location gets better with time."}
{"text":"Great service. I accidentally broke my glass of wine and they refilled it right away. The beef carpaccio was very good. Pasta was cooked to aldente. I would go back to try the raw tuna dish next"}
{"text":"Great selection of wines for pretty reasonable prices. The food was nothing special though and overpriced. Unlike other reviewers we didn't find the food salty. One of my girlfriends even asked for salt. 
Nice atmosphere and decor, but a little soulless. The service was a little slow for a Sunday night.
Overall good spot for wine lovers, but definitely not the best in term of food."}
{"text":"This location is not as great as the yorkville one. That's a shame because I'm in the area very often. The food is still ok, yet to be fair I haven't tried any mains except lasagna.  Appetizers were decent. 
Since it's a wine bar I have to mention they have a great selection of wines in any price range. The service was alright, again not as good as it is in yorkville but still not bad. Would I return? Yes if other places are busy and/or I want some good wine and cheese. Probably wouldn't have a full meal here though."}
{"text":"Cibo is really close to exemplary. The staff is friendly and helpful. The wine selection is good. The super Tuscan my husband and I shared was as bold as I expected. Gluten free options are clearly marked on the menu. But both our meals missed by just a smidge. His seafood risotto was tasty, but the rice was just a little undercooked. I ordered the salad that was essentially an arugula-based salads Nicoise. All the ingredients were perfectly prepared, but it lacked zest. I improved it with the balsamic vinegar on the table, but the result of that was a little heavy handed. My husband reports that the bread was delicious and had excellent texture; he suggests it might have been better with the rosemary incorporated rather than on top."}
{"text":"I ate at cibo last night for the second time. I ordered a pizza and was disappointed. The toppings only covered about 60% of the pizza and I was left with a bunch of crust with barely any cheese. 3 star"}
{"text":"Many reasons to rate different stars, but I specifically chose 2/5 because to me service and food quality is the upmost important. Service to which was provided by (Jillian) was terrible. For this type of restaurant i would expect better. Wait tome was good seated right away. Approached by waitress about 10 mins later asking if we wanted tap water or distilled. We ordered cocktails (may i recommend the sangrias). After this waitress came to our table perhaps 2 times max and that was to bring out the food. The water glasses are small and im a big water drinker. I had to search for the waitress to ask for things. While i noticed other waiters/waitresses were constantly walking around tables with a water bottle offering and inquiring how their meals were. Food was of good quality but small portion for price (expected). Overall ratings:
Atmosphere: 3/5 nice seatings, but loud music and cluttering
Service: 1/5 terrible. 
Food quality: 4/5 could have been better"}
{"text":"I can only review CIBO as a place for drinks. The ambiance was great, it's spacious and the staff was really friendly! 

I will definitely be going back for lunch on the patio before summer ends"}
{"text":"Best food I've had in a long time.   Very cool spot.  Very busy.  Been there twice will ebb back again.  Nice menu."}
{"text":"I'd say this place is 3.5 stars, but not quite 4, so I rounded down. I've been here about 4 or 5 times now - twice for brunch and the rest for dinner. 

The times I've been for brunch, the service has been sporadic. Today, our server started out great; really friendly and explained each brunch station and about the mimosas and sparkling wines on special. We both ordered coffee, and that was the last time our server came by our table without us having to flag him down. 

On both occasions, I've had to ask several times for coffee refills (the cups are quite small) and I felt that I was somehow annoying the server by asking. 

We also had to ask the bussers to clear empty  plates from our table a couple of times. I should point out that the bussers were definitely working hard. I never saw any of them just standing around, but maybe they need an extra set of hands when it gets really busy. 

The food at brunch has been mostly good, but the pizza cook was exceptionally stingy with the toppings today. He put only about 3-4 pieces of each item I requested (mushrooms and green peppers - because I guess they are SO expensive) and when I asked for extra cheese, he literally threw on about half a tablespoon on top. Not a great pizza when it's mostly dough and sauce. Luckily, the delicious arancini made up for the boring pizza. 

I also tried half a waffle with mixed berries (thankfully the girl at the waffle station was not so stingy with her toppings). I enjoyed the roast lamb, and the selection of fresh fruit and cheese, as well as the smoked salmon and the arugula salad. Definitely some nice choices available. They have a large selection of desserts, but I've never tried any of them. The most sweetness I can handle at brunch is the berry waffle. They do look nice, though. 

On the visits where I was having dinner, I found the service to be miles better than during brunch. The food was quite good, with the exception of a burned chicken Parmesan one night (which was immediately corrected when we pointed it out). Did I mention that I really like their arancini? It's probably my favourite menu item so far. 

I think my biggest issue with this place is the overpriced wine list. On average, they are around $20 per glass, which I thought was about $4-$5 too much. It would be nice if they offered something in the $10-$12 range. But I recently heard they have half price wine nights, so I'll probably go back when that's happening so I don't feel so bad about having a second glass."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for their Bubbles and Brunch special.  My friend bought a Groupon ($35 for brunch for 2) which was a good deal.  The food was pretty good (all-you-can-eat brunch buffet with breakfast foods and lunch foods).  The weird thing was that you had to go up and down the two different levels inside the restaurant to get the food you wanted (upstairs = lunch foods, downstairs = breakfast foods).  The strange thing was our server changed after 1.5 hrs of being in the restaurant and no one told us until we wanted to get the bill."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews, but I was really surprised to see all the negative reviews for Cibo.  I've eaten a few things here, and have been for the most part really pleased. 

Their rosemary focaccia is DELICIOUS I really enjoyed it with the olives.  Fresh and warm from the oven, not to mention complimentary.  Perfect!

The arancini rice balls are gorgeous and a large portion, in my opinion they're some of the best I've ever had, and I quite liked the sauce (marinara with a bit of kick?) that accompanied it.  Super crunchy on the outside, nice and warm on the inside.  

I've ordered the gnocchi in tomato sauce, which is just okay.  It's missing a bit of cream or something to help make the sauce a bit richer.

The ravioli with sun dried tomatoes is probably the best main dish I've had so far at Cibo - crazy good, and made fresh in house!

I've also ordered the short ribs which I found were a bit dry and a touch fatty, but the gorgonzola polenta helped make up for it.  I wouldn't order the short ribs again, not worth the 34 odd dollars.  (Thanks for paying mom, lol).

Good deals for drinks on Thursday, they also make a fairly decent caesar - though I wish it was bigger!

Service has been very good for me the three times I've gone.  The only gripe I have is that if you have a larger party, they make you book a private room and order off a price fixed menu that starts at 45 dollars per person for dinner (this does NOT include any drinks).  Really?  It's a HUGE restaurant and when you go you definitely want to be in the middle of the gorgeous space, not tucked away in a room and forced into eating dessert to get some value out of your experience.  I've tried to come in twice in the last month with 12 people and ended up taking my $1000 bill elsewhere.  

All in all, I'll be back. I want to try SO many things on the menu, and it really is a great space."}
{"text":"Disappointing food, nice atmosphere. My spaghetti had the consistency of ramen, and the cream sauce lacked flavour. My dining partner was equally unimpressed with the orecchiette. The added chicken was airplane meal quality. It's too bad because the restaurant space is lovely, a converted loft. Shame about the kitchen. The service was also erratic. It's hard to pay these prices when there's Buca or Terroni down the street."}
{"text":"I have super mixed feelings about this place. It's a mix of pretentious with some sprinkles of nice. 

My friends came here to celebrate a birthday. No where on the website or menu did it say that outside cakes were not allowed. We were told immediately by the server that we had to ask the event coordinator in advance to bring a cake in. He gave us this stare, which I interpreted as, \"well you should have known. Duh?\" - my first dose of pretentious. Yes, we are on king street and it's posh, but it's not \"common knowledge\" in my books. I celebrate birthdays a lot at restaurants and have brought cakes. I get that there is a health and safety thing with bringing outside food, but I've never had an issue except at one other place on King Street West, but they wrote it on their website that there would be a plating charge. Usually, it's mentioned on the website. We spoke to the event coordinator and she said she will make an \"exception\" and serve the cake as long as we pay a plating fee of $3.50 per person. My suggestion - put it on the website and let the policy be known!!!

The server was still nice after I let my frustrations be known - some sprinkles of nice. However, after our dinner,  I had to ask him several times to bring the cake out. Albeit, the place got super busy and he was working hard, but we waited a long time for the cake to the served, to the point where they acknowledged the wait and took the plating fee off the bill. I'm glad they did this, but it still made me super angry that they took forever and should have taken off the plating fee to begin with since the policy wasn't written anywhere. I give the service and entire dining experience a C+.

I would give the food a B+. I wasn't expecting it to be great, but it didn't turn out so bad. We had the polenta fries, bruschetta, and ravioli stuffed with lobster. 

On Thursdays before 7:00pm, they have happy hour and wine is half price (not sure if this is for other days and what time it starts at).

The place is very pretty and it's huge! There are several rooms to have a private event or party in. It got super busy after 7:00pm on a Thursday evening.

My tip: Make a reservation and don't bring in a cake. It's really not worth it."}
{"text":"Horrible, disgusting food. Horrible staff. Incredibly rude. Would never go back, nor will any friends/family. Just the worst experience. Too bad. Was really hoping to like this place, it looks so great from the outside."}
{"text":"Repeat of the same old thing. Spend big money on look, add some fancy looking plates and a bunch of LED lighting with exposed glass wine cabinets for impressions and assume most people will be wowed by the food. Sorry, it's nothing special. 
As a group we ordered and ordered. I doubt anything was left to experience off of the menu, and in the end the flavours were lacklustre. Rice balls had no flavour. Pizza was good, but nothing I'd rush to visit for. Beef short ribs were well cooked, and perhaps the best thing to order. For some crazy reason they had no serving spoons. Everything came with a standard table fork. Huge plate of mushrooms, or salad or a side of some sort, had a table fork on the plate. Weird. 
Desert was good, cappuccino was well made with perfect foam, too bad they put zero effort into the presentation. 
Honestly, save your money and move on."}
{"text":"Used to go here years ago when it was Ciao. Standard stuff. Service is hit or miss. Easy to book a table through open table. 

3.75/5 *"}
{"text":"A-OK is a fair enough rating. I won't say \"don't go to Cibo!\", but I won't rush back either.

Let me start with the good points: servers were attentive and friendly, which was great considering we had a group reservation for one of their \"party rooms\". They were prompt and attentive, had some good knowledge of their wine offerings, and given that we were celebrating two anniversaries, they were also nice enough to bring out complementary prosecco for everyone at the end of the meal.

The place itself is beautiful, which isn't a shock since it's part of the Liberty Group and they're known for that. The wine bottle walls, exposed brick, unfinished ceilings, and interesting art on the way to the washrooms all make you really take note.

The food was hit and miss. Beef carpaccio was good as was their really nice bread, some of the other antipasti we ordered didn't go over so well. Mains varied. The spaghetti carbonara (a simple enough thing) was a hit, but the margherita pizza ordered by another in our party - well - it looked like a cheese pizza from Pizza Pizza someone had thrown some basil on. Not really what we expected.

As for me, I had pappardelle with a lamb ragu, and it was a satisfying meal, nicely done really.

The wine selection is quite impressive and has a broad range of bottles available - from about $30 and up - decent bottles in the $40-60 range as well, and lots seemed to be available by the glass.

Prices weren't outrageous for the food either - pastas were good portions for $14-20, secondi were mostly in the $20s - so you can go for a nice meal and splurge a bit on the wine."}
{"text":"The food is very good, served in a beautiful space but the wait staff is self-involved and disinterested. I sat in a rather empty restaurant and was all but ignored for much of my experience as the unenthusiastic, unengaged wait staff chatted amongst  themselves. It just goes to show you, in the restaurant business you can get everything right but if you get the service culture wrong, you end up losing customers."}
{"text":"Very loud, average food  and  service.  Bathrooms are disgusting , city officials should close this place down."}
{"text":"I came here with friends for brunch AYCE.

The options are quite limited, and majority of the food there served cold. (Cold platter, cheese plates, desserts, yogurts, fruits) They do have made to order pizza and omellet. But honestly the taste were average.

Ambience is 5/5, very private, and good service."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience at their Downtown King St. location, yet decided to give them a second chance on a business meeting.
Went in for their Sunday Brunch with Mimosa.
We were a group of 4, and were seated quick. Food was slightly different, tuned towards the clientele in Yorkville, and honestly much better than their mid-town location and miles ahead of their King St. location.

Service was much much better too.

Overall, a nice brunch and a definite repeat!"}
{"text":"Drove past this establishment on King St. W probably a million times, and rode the 504 Streetcar another billion times, and never knew it existed, let alone it being a good place for Sunday Brunch. So when my girlfriend saw a Groupon they had, she asked me, and I told her that I had no idea. Being adventurous, she bought it and made reservations for the 2 of us. This is where it started going down like a train-wreck:

1) The girl on the phone gave us wrong timings for the Brunch, and as such we ended up with a reservation only 15 mins prior to them shutting down.

2) We arrived a little early (8 mins early), but it took the hostess 15mins to get a us to our table despite the place being half empty at 2:15PM and the patio almost empty with the exception of 1 occupied table. The hostess was kind enough to point us towards the food stations and let us know that they'll be closing in 15mins!

3) Our waitress asked us if this was our first visit, and we replied in affirmation and asked for suggestions. Now my girlfriend is a teetotaler, so usually we order separate drinks, or I end up with 2 drinks. We are perfectly fine with that. That being said, we asked about almost every table drinking the same drink, but we were offered juice or coffee/espresso. Given our options, we chose juices.

4) Food was okay.
- Omelets, mussels, and pizzas were the best dishes.
- The waffles were too thick.
- The salads were meh.
- The pasta was decent.
- The cheeses are pretty good.
- The bacon was over cooked & way too salty.
- The breads & bagels were okay.
- Smoked salmon was decent too.
- Fruit bar was okay. For the life of me I do not understand why most restaurants mix grapefruits with other sweeter fruits. Not everyone likes their fruits to be mix of sweet & bitter!
- The lady at the dessert bar was gone and was replaced by a gentleman from the Cured Meats bar. As such he couldn't explain the different desserts any better than my 6yr old niece, and used the same glove to handle all different desserts. Thus I ended up with Chocolate on my Mango Mousse, and Mango Mousse on my Tiramisu. My girlfriend ended up with a mix of Chocolate+Mango Mousse on her Cheesecake!

5) The worst was after we left the establishment. As we were walking out, we met up with an old friend of mine who was dining by the window. It was nice to met her after a while, but as were discussing the usual about our plates, lo behold, we discovered that the Breakfast Brunch DOES INCLUDE 1 Glass of PROSECCO/MIMOSA per guest. Not only did our hostess or waitress never mention this once, but even when we prodded her on our choice for drinks. I asked my girlfriend if I had missed something, but even she looked at me totally blank.

Well, an extra $16 for 4 glasses of juices on our bill isn't bad, but if we had the opportunity to make informed choices, we wouldn't have felt cheated.

Sorry, Groupon or not, I'm certainly never stepping foot inside an establishment that works by misinforming/cheating their patrons even if they offered me free food & drinks for life!"}
{"text":"Came in for Sunday Brunch. Was impressed, they were able to turn the restaurant into a buffet style brunch which offers both Italian and Western style brunch options. 

There was an egg station where you can have made to order eggs made with a lot of good premium toppings. Also, there was a pizza and pasta station. Both also made to order with good toppings to choose. There is a pizza oven right there, so it was quick and cool to see and also, tasted great. 

There was also a rack of lamb carving station. This was probably the highlight of the food. Roasted to a perfect medium, with a delicious mustard and some banana peppers. 

There were also some cheeses and deli meats, as well as a waffle station and fruits and dessert. The dessert was clearly store bought, but it's okay, it's not what they are known for so you can't really judge on that. 

Another thing to note, all bubblies are 50% during brunch - whether it be by the glass, or bottle. Awesome!

I would come back for their brunch."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch with Italian bubbles. Love their prosciutto and cheeses, freshly made pizza and pasta, and of course their polenta fries. Great service and ambience as well!!"}
{"text":"I went here to celebrate a friend's birthday. The air conditioning was broken, so I am not sure why they were still operating and open that day. With the air conditioning broken and the wood burning oven at full speed, you can only imagine how hot the restaurant was. The service was horrible - young and inexperienced waiters. We ordered a bottle of prosecco, our waiter wasn't trained to know which one from the menu was the driest one. From my experience, when you order a bottle of anything, the waiter should pour a little in the glass for someone at the table to sample. Well, he just went ahead and poured all the glasses without anyone sampling the quality. At the same time, he spilt some on the table. He left the bottle on the table and didn't give us the wine chiller. We had to ask another waiter. The food wasn't as good as the king street location or their Ciao Wine Bar. I order the arugula salad, and there was barley any dressing or gorgonzola cheese. The pasta was overcooked. The pizza was tasty. I just wanted to eat and get out. We were all dripping with sweat."}
{"text":"The overall atmosphere of cibo is really nice. Sort of rustic and lively. Our server was good, but not super nice or helpful. I'm giving it 2 stars because I ordered the fettuccine alfredo. The cream sauce was a little runny, not a nice thick cream, as one would expect. BUT the worst part is that not only was the pasta NOT al dente (which it should be), it was really overcooked. It was mushy, flavourless pasta. I only ordered that, and my bill came out to 25$ Definitely not worth the money. I had a better experience when the restaurant used to be ciao wine bar. The only good think was the bread; it tastes great. But it's not enticing enough for me to want to go back."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss for service. The hostess didn't walk me to my table and just pointed that my guess was around the corner. There was two girls just sitting on their chairs. You are a hostess, get off your ass and walk the guest to their table.

The server took like 10 mins to come to our table to give us water. I had to call a bus boy who turned out to be our waiter.

Food is always decent for the price that's why I go back but it's always stressful knowing if you will get good service or not, how hard is it to get good staff?  There are too many other restaurants to choose from to be sub par. I might give it one more try and if not, find another Italian restaurant to go to."}
{"text":"We had a lovely evening at Cibo last night catching up with an old colleague. The restaurant is beautiful, open and had ambient lighting that made catching up perfect. The noise level wasn't very loud as well. The food is delicious, they have a selection of fresh pastas, pizzas and cheese/meat boards. Their wine selection of course was also spectacular ranging from glasses ($7-15) to bottles ($40 -$350) and included wines from around the world. Our server was attentive and checked in on us several times. They also have a great special on Tuesday for lobster dishes (4 of them) all priced at $25. I ordered their seafood pasta and enjoyed how they had lots of seafood (clams, mussels, shrimp and squid). My colleagues both ordered lobster ravioli and enjoyed their meal as well. They also have gluten free options and were really accommodating to my diary free request as well."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian restaurant. Great space, super friendly service and quality food. We started with the beef carpacio (fresh and tender), the burrato which comes with soft prosciutto and artichoke was tasty as was the bread with Rosemary. We then ordered pastas: the lasagna and the spaghetti carbonara using their house made spaghetti. Both were delicious. They've got solid cocktails and wines as well. There are amazing looking pizzas and entrees which I'll try in the future. I only wish they did half portions of pastas."}
{"text":"Great food, but small portions. I enjoyed mine so much that I was only disappointed there wasn't more. Nice layout and decor, great for celebrations. Note: if you plan on bringing you're own cake they do charge a plate fee (as many places do)."}
{"text":"Came here for after dinner drinks, sat at the bar.  It wasn't a positive or negative experience.  It's much like other similar establishments.  Admittedly, we were probably there at a busy time, but it's one of those places where you have to shout at one another to be heard.  It's a spacious establishment, but the bathrooms left much wanting.  Would probably not return voluntarily, but would not be opposed being there again if necessary."}
{"text":"This place is a joke, we got server raw pork, nothing is label so you have no idea what they are serving. It's not even worth to get a groupon to go to them
Place not recommended. You should spend the money else like at Ancaster mills or spencer with much better quality and service"}
{"text":"From the moment we were greeted we were treated with friendly hosts and while the restaurant was busy, we were seated right away. Our server was really friendly and he had great knowledge of the menu. My boyfriend and I got the ravioli and the mixed seafood linguine, along with the raw tuna as our app appetizer. We also got the complimentary bread which was delicious. The food overall was great - especially our dessert which was the chocolate baci bombe. Our main dishes took a while to come but our server made that up by putting our dessert on the house. I would highly recommend coming here as the wine selection is huge and the atmosphere is a very friendly and relaxing one. I have nothing bad to say about Cibo!"}
{"text":"This place had great decor and a nice vibe, trendy feeling. Wish they had flights of wine to taste. I was a little disappointed by the wine list of what you could get by the glass. This place would offer more if you're looking to drink by the bottle. I don't think I would go back"}
{"text":"One word: salty.

Which may also translate into my attitude for this restaurant but that night when I went, my goodness everything was salty. Water was your best friend and you'd best wish that the waiter/ress came by often to refill your bottle.

It started off with the Rosemary table bread. The first bite was okay, until when you go for the second and then you realize something is off: it's salty. But whichever, assuming that was just the table bread and not the main course, perhaps things could've got better.

We had the red sauce seafood risotto. I usually like risotto and you know what, had they been less heavy on the salt - this would've been perfect. The rigatoni with the Italian Sausage - salty. The pizza with the prosciutto which generally I like to order - extra salty. Every food we had was salty and I could not understand what the correlation was. Maybe the fact that it was a wine bar restaurant and perhaps... salt would go good with wine?

Needless to say I didn't try the dessert. I would wonder if the dessert could've possibly been bitter or salty."}
{"text":"Given that I live about five minutes away from Cibo, it's indeed surprising that it took me this long to check the place out.

I'd made a reservation for a Monday night and the joint was surprisingly packed when we arrived. It's a pretty cool space and our table was right by the kitchen, so the dinner was off to a good start.

We decided to start with the Arancini (\"rice balls stuffed with ragu, melted mozzarella\"). First of all, hats off to Cibo for the impressive presentation. The three oversized rice balls arrived on a wooden platter accompanied by salad and a rich tomato sauce. The arancini, which sadly was not as hot as it could have been, was packed with meat sauce and mozzarella, and the aforementioned sauce proved an ideal complement.

For my main, I ordered the Tagliatelle (\"traditional Bolognese sauce, parmigiano reggiano\"). While there were certainly problems with this dish - the pasta was noticeably overcooked, for one thing - I enjoyed eating it quite a bit as the meat sauce was quite flavorful and rich.

I should also mention that I ordered a pint of the Cibo Ale, and the house-made (?) beer was surprisingly tasty."}
{"text":"I don't get what the fuss is about? We went for brunch 35 something pp coffee not included. The selection is soo lacking. 3 kinds of pasta all meh. Mushroom pasta, pesto and rose. Nothing special. The pizza station isnt good, its kinda salty, the crust is too chewy. The cheese stations average, i will say the fruit was good? Also alot of ham and pork...
Meh wouldnt recommend."}
{"text":"The service was less than friendly yesterday at 5:00 PM. I  visited the restaurant with my to daughters and was greeted by a friendly staff member that seated us in a completely empty restaurant. The waitress that came to our table could not force a smile if she tried, and frankly ruined the experience even if the food was great which it was not. I had to ask if there were any specials, which I ended up ordering (the market fresh fish). She brought some bread to the table, but looked at me like I was an alien when I asked my kids if they wanted any more (which they refused after they saw her expression) The two pasta dishes that my daughters got were not bad, but my fish was nothing to write home about. A bit dry and over cooked. I could not wait to leave just to get away from the bad energy the waitress was strewing around the place. I have been here many times but never with my kids and I don't think I will come back!"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch with my family. Really enjoyed all the different food stations and food was quite delicious. 

We started with omelette station and breakfast food downstairs to worked our way to the lunch food upstairs. 

Overall the service is good. Had waive the staff down a few times to gets water refill. 

It's also missing a star because it's a bit chaotic on how/where to get food."}
{"text":"If you're going to try Cibo, make sure to go on a Thursday between 4 and 7pm when wine and cocktails are half price. This is the only reason to ever go to Cibo, imo, because the food is bad-mediocre at best. We had the arancini balls (an insult to Italy), a radicchio salad (bitter and strangely composed), the lamb ragu papardelle (fine), and the gorgonzola pizza (not bad). The service was excellent, though!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of popping by the newly opened Cibo Wine Bar yesterday with a group of 7. With a small-medium patio out front, Cibo may not look too big, but once you step foot inside you'll notice how HUGE the space is!

The décor is sleek and modern, and the booth we were sat it was large and quite comfortable (would sit about 8 people). I found it a bit too dim/dark inside, so perhaps opt for the patio if you stop by. Finding the bathroom will take you on a mini trek around the space, but it's a good excuse to see the beauty that Cibo has to offer.

Happy hour is until 7pm, so take advantage of the half priced drinks! I got a few delicious Sangria glasses in before 7, and I couldn't have been more pleased. Some of the best white sangria in the city, folks.

The food was a bit of a mixed bag.

After devouring some of their delicious on-the-house rosemary bread with olives, I stole some of my friends Polenta fries. Very yummy, cute, stacked presentation, and came with a  ridiculously delicious cheese dip. That was the highlight of the food, though. I also had the following:

Arancini - not much going on here. Bland on the inside, and not enough cheese. Would not order again. Large portion, though!
Lasagna - decent, though I found it a bit bland. It was lacking some kick, some seasoning, some something. That was the consensus around the table from 5 out of 6 people that had pasta.
Chocolate Hazlenut Bombe - good! The mousse inside was flavoured nicely. Nothing to write home about, though.

The service was okay. I would say our server was a bit absent and hard to flag down at times.

Overall a decent experience. I would not come back to order the pasta. I have heard some good things about the pizza, so I may give that a try. Regardless, I will be back to down some more of the incredible Sangria!"}
{"text":"I went here for new years eve dinner with my parents and my fiance. It was a prix fixe menu for 70 dollars that came to over 90 including tax and tip...before wine. 

There was one vegetarian choice per course, which is expected and totally fine when it is 3-4 choices per course. The vegetarian choices sounded good and I was really excited before going. 

So, the first course was a caprese salad with one very generous slab of Buffalo mozzarella, one slice of red tomato (a vine tomato I think), and one slice of yellow tomato. The tomatoes weren't great, but it is winter and they're out of season. The dressing was a flavorless olive oil and thin balsamic vinegar, and one leaf of basil. It was okay but would have been greatly improved by smoking the tomatoes, or infusing the oil, or even just using a high quality flavourful olive oil...or more basil. Or even slicing the cheese thinner.

Second course was \"crispy ricotta gnocchi.\" This was where it really fell apart. They were battered and over cooked so it was just like hollow, deep fried batter, none of the tender pillows of ricotta gnocchi I'm used to with this dish. It was also over salted and just incredibly greasy...this coming from someone who loves salty french fries or onion rings. I couldn't finish them. The portion was also ridiculously small (I know gnocchi is always a smaller portion but these were mini gnocchi and only came as 8-10 pearl sized balls of grease) and I was really jealous of my non vegetarian dining partners who had plates of fresh pasta, but again, I couldn't finish them anyway. 

I was really looking forward to the third course, risotto funghi, with 4 kinds of mushrooms, because I love mushrooms and was really hungry and already disappointed in the meal. Unfortunately it was the worst course of the night for me. It tasted like campbells mushroom soup that someone had added *extra* salt too. There were clumps of the rice stuck together. The different mushrooms which I picked out all tasted exactly the same, with the same texture, as they'd been overcooked in this mess. There was one whole clove of garlic, but the garlic flavours hadn't penetrated the rest of the dish. It was seriously awful, and my whole table agreed it was inedible. I was really jealous of the sides everyone else's meals came with, like wilted greens. They said theirs was okay but the steaks they request medium rare were unevenly cooked and medium well done that medium rare. There were some generous slices of parmesan on top of the risotto though, and that was the highlight of my meal. 

It isn't like me to not be able to eat my food. I've been to many amazing Italian restaurants in Toronto, Italy, and other countries. I also eat at malls and cafeterias and 7-11. This food wouldn't have been good even if I were drunk (and I did get drunk on all the wine, since I was on an empty stomach as the food they served me was inedible). 

Everyone else enjoyed their food, but were a little disappointed as nothing was outstanding or particularly good quality. It seemed to be a case of them not caring about vegetarian food at all, or maybe their chefs don't know how to work with flavours other than just using meat. The over salting was really jarring. I love salt, but this was disgusting.

Overall, it was one of the very worst meals I have ever been served and the price was outrageous for something I'd be angry and being served at a local pub.

(also, I'm not sure how to change my profile but I'm no longer vegan, heh)"}
{"text":"On the fence with this location.. My first time here was back in December 2016 for Winterlicious and it was a great experience - good food and service! I'm not sure what happened in the past few months -maybe staff changeover or something? We ordered food for pickup and once we got there, not only did they forget an order of pasta, they also charged us at regular prices instead of the lunch special prices of $18 plus tax so it was a huge surprise when our bill came to over $100! The waiter did correct it in the end AFTER we brought it to their attention but we were all confused as to how they got it wrong in the first place, as our orders were all from the lunch special menu. We waited and waited for the missed order, and it finally came after 30 minutes! The waitress who handled our bills was haughty and curt with us when we asked to split the bills separately. None of us ended up tipping in the end. I really hope they will improve their customer service..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The prosciutto platter is decent, wine selection is decent but the service is top notch! I didnt give them 5 stars because the lamb ragu i ordered  once was not ideal but the seafood pasta was enjoyable. As far as dessert goes, i have only tried what seems to be a ferrero rocher on STEROIDS (not sure what its actually called on the menu) AMAZING nonetheless."}
{"text":"Great spot on King St for hang outs, drinks or a quick bite. Went out for a work dinner and found it to be good! Not too loud (as most of these spots can get a bit out of hand!) and good ambience. The food was pretty good too - had their arugula salad which was ok - the cabbage and arugula combo didn't really sit well with me. Also had their lobster pasta (GF) and it was flavourful and spicy, just how I like it. However the lobster came cracked in half but was a tad bit over cooked. Hard to get to, so perhaps avoid this dish if you're not into breaking into your own lobster! Overall a place I would definitely go back to, especially with friends or family!"}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times since day one when they opened, It  never disappoints.  I have seen how this restaurant has evolved over the past few years, from their high level of service to the quality of the food, it's getting better & better each other.   I am fortunate to have had a chance to meet the  GM of this place.  Her name is Victoria, and she's the manager that every restaurant would want. She's professional yet warm, attentive, friendly, observant, and her energy on the floor is infectious.  
This has been and will be my go-to restaurant when I am around the area. 
Thank You again for your impeccable service and food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went out for date night on a Saturday with a reservation. Upon arriving we were informed that \"our table wasn't ready\" so we sat at the bar. Very busy on a Saturday night which I can understand. We ended up waiting at the bar for over ten minutes and I had to follow up with the hostesses (4 of them) twice to check wether our table was ready. Finally it was and we were seated 15 minutes post reservation time. Not impressed by the lack of coordination & organization, but once we were seated everything was great!

Our server was a little soft spoken so it was difficult to hear her well, but she was very friendly and courteous. Boyfriend ordered a beer and the keg it came from was flat - she swapped it out quickly for a fresh one. We ordered the bruschetta and a Cesar salad to start - both were fantastic and moderately sized portions. They bring a lovely basil and oil based pretzel loaf to your table free of charge. 

For dinner I had the steak, sautéed spinach and garlic mash - AMAZING!! Boyfriend had the cannelloni and he loved it too! We skipped dessert because we were so full but I had a great dining experience minus the hiccup with our reservation. It is a busy bar with a louder atmosphere but great quality of food and drink."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful Valentine dinner.  Food was terrific with good size portions.  Service was warm and friendly. Lasagna, grilled calamari and Lobster Ravioli was excellent.  Will be going again for sure."}
{"text":"Went for the Sunday brunch on Valentine's Day. Very busy as expected but being able to make reservations and check time availability online is really convenient. Food was great, buffet style for brunch so you can eat whatever your heart desires. Everything was very fresh including croissants, rosemary focaccia bread. Waffles/pizza/omelettes/fresh pasta all made to order and lots of yummy things worth trying. The decor is really nice and it's a great environment for family or just for a date."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, wait staff a little rough, great food.

Cibo Yonge Street is very similar to Cibo on King Street. The ambiance is warm, modern and relaxed. It does get a little loud when the place is full. The food is good and the prices reasonable. However we found the wait staff to be friendly\", but a little too \"in your face\". There may be a few reasons for this including needing to turn tables quickly and just not having enough staff. Either way, it just didn't seem as \"relaxed\" as other places.

We went on Lobster Tuesday and they had various dishes including a Lobster pasta and salad. I had the Lobster pasta and my guest had the Branzino., The presentation is definitely nice and the portions good.

For a better experience in the future, when dining with two people, I would go at a non-peak time and get a booth. These look comfortable and are a little hard to come by when it's busy.....unless you have some clout.....which I hate to say but yes, Cibo does seems to cater more favorably to a younger attractive crowd."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a lively Italian restaurant with a old and new school menu, a warm yet modern interior and great service, you can't go wrong at CIBO Wine Bar. Having been to both this and the Yonge Street location, I can say that the King Street location is definitely better. And being able to get a table for 4 on a busy Friday King Street evening within 20 minutes is also great.

We first went to Gusto 101 and after being greeted with an hour and a half wait (from a place that generally doesn't take reservations) we walked over to Cibo. And I'm glad we did. To begin with, the space is an old industrial building converted to a great space with most of the original building restored with a few modern touches. There are lots of seating options from the bar to community tables to large booths.

The wait staff is generally plentiful and there's always someone around if you need anything.  The menu features a wide variety of pastas, pizzas, salads and meat and seafood dishes. The food itself is good but not spectacular. My rating is heavily weighted on the space, the service and the overall ambiance. We had  a few appetizers and some pasta dishes, The portions are fairly big, The best part of the meal had to be the dessert. The Panna Cotta in one of the best I've tasted.

Plan to spend at least a couple of hours for dinner and enjoy the ample variety of wines either by the glass or by the bottle."}
{"text":"Located on the trendy restaurant row of King St West in Toronto, Cibo Wine Bar is quite an interesting experience for either the dining and the restaurant.  Walking in your surrounded by Crystal Head vodka bottles lining each of the wood walls of the entrance way and the impressive glass walled wine cellar.  We were sat in the bar/dining area of the restaurant.  Warm wood tones, glass, comfortable seating added to the ambiance.  As soon as our party arrived our server was friendly and informative about drink and wine selections.  They have a pretty long wine list of wine served by the glass.  I looked at the bar and I saw that they used a temperature controlled wine dispensing and storage unit.  All the wine is exactly poured to the ounce and it is served at its optimal temperature for the best wine experinece, even by the glass. 

 Our table of 7 ordered 4 different appetizers.  The Arracini (rice balls stuffed with mozzerlla), polenta fries with gorgonzola dip (corn meal deep fried), polpettine ( mini meat balls in tomato sauce) and a house salad with balsamic dressing. Our server took our order and dropped off fresh foccaica bread to nibble on.  The foccaia was so fresh that I could have eaten it all night, perfectly seasoned and very tasty.  Our table ordered entree's consisting of various pizzas and pastas.  Most of the pastas are made fresh in house.  I can always appreciate a restaurant that does this because you can really taste the difference.  Our server was excellent and kept regular table checks to make sure our drinks and foccaia was full.
  
After about 25 min our meals arrived all together and we were treated to great flavors of the thin crusted pizzas and fantastic pasta's.  As we finished our tables were pre-bussed  and our table ordered desserts ranging from lemon ricotta cheese cake to a chocolate baci bombe.  Our experience was finally complete by the manager coming by to make sure we enjoyed our time at Cibo.  I had an excellent experience and it seems that we are already making plans to come back for Mothers Day."}
{"text":"I went here last Saturday for my birthday dinner. Highly recommend everyone to go here! I was running a bit late and called to let them know and they were really understanding. Our waitress also was the sweetest."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our first visit to Cibo last night.  The atmosphere is lovely - cosy, despite its size and it has a cool, hip vibe.  The menu is outstanding - fresh, healthy options.The food was delicious, thoughtfully prepared, and the proportions were perfect. Our salads were outstanding and our mains - tuna and calamari - were expertly cooked.  The only negative feedback that I will offer, is that the customer service did not meet our expectations. Our waiter was abrupt and distracted. Support servers seemed to lack proper training. Our main meals were brought out before our first course was cleared and the server stood at our table with our plates in her hand, while she waited for us to make room. Cutlery was taken away and not replaced immediately so that we could begin our second course. Staff gathered near the computer where they placed the orders (and which we happened to be seated beside) and engaged in private conversations using swear words, oblivious to guests.  Generally, guests may be willing to overlook these things, but if Cibo wants to elevate its status in a crowded restaurant space, proper hiring and training of staff will be critical."}
{"text":"Very fresh and very tasty food!  Service was excellent - friendly, prompt and helpful."}
{"text":"Got a groupon, $40/2people. Made reservation for 11:30, their earliest time. I suggest go early as it will start to get crowded. The area for food is not the widest. no bubbles were offered,but wines were 1/2 off. The mussels were cold..i was expecting them to be hot. pasta as mediocre, the best was the pizza. I found everything a bit too oily and salty. their selection was ok, no lamp chop, only beef, but beef was too dry. the best was made to order pizza. it was fresh and tasty. waitress was tentative, however i would not pay full price for this.."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch at cibo with groupon deal 2 for $40. Previously went to the yorkville location. The king location has a better set up, no need to walk up and down for the food. Everything was nicely in one location. The servers were quite polite also but not too attentive. 

The down side: Our reservation was at 11:30 we showed up at 11:21 the doors were locked and some ppl were waiting outside it was quite cold so we went to take shelter at the shoppers next door. We went back at 11:33 but doors were still locked and we had to wait 5more mins. It's fine I guess... but would be better if they let guest wait inside. Also I've notice that our server never served us the complimentary bread but everyone around us got bread. I didn't care too much since it's a buffet and I can get my own bread... but we weren't offered and also we were the only Asian group in that seating area idk if that has to do with anything ...

Basically would not go if I didn't have a groupon. $35 per person for brunch here would be too much and considering it wasn't the best service I will definitely reconsider"}
{"text":"Shopping in the area, we decided to give Cibo a try. Fresh bread, sauces and pasta made in house and they had Burrata and pizza on the menu. Quiet on an Easter Monday.

The place has gorgeous high ceilings. My kid commented that it looks like a Restoration Hardware catalog. Friendly and attentive service. Not sure why the long departed table beside us was not cleared.

I'm not sure I would simply refer to that yummy focaccia as bread. Warm, drizzled in olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt and rosemary. Mmm.

My kid wanted the Burrata without the arugula and they kindly offered to substitute something else so she happily added tomato. No egg in the fresh bread meant she had that too.

I was sold on the lobster ravioli, a decadent and hard to find treat. It was perfectly sized and not swimming in sauce. So delicious!"}
{"text":"We went to cibo wine bar on a Thursday night (9pm). Street parking is free after 9 (everyday of the week) so it was perfect timing! Lol when we entered, there were two groups waiting ahead of us. I was annoyed to find that the hostesses were on the laptop and didn't even bother to look up. Eventually they greeted us and said the wait was going to be 20 minutes, so we left our number as they said they'd text. We came back in 20 minutes although we didn't receive a text. There was a different host who seated us after another 10 minutes. We never got a text from them and we would've waited aimlessly if we hadn't returned, so I'd advise you wait in the restaurant to not lose your spot and shorten your wait time. 
The restaurant has amazing decor. High ceilings, bright lightbulbs in a somewhat dim atmosphere, huge wine rack... Love it. We got the seared asahi tuna and seafood risotto which were amazing!!! The tuna dish is a bit on the oily side though. 
We got cannoli something as a dessert and that was the fail of the night lolll it was so bland and too creamy for my taste. Should've gone with tiramisu which is apparently made in house fresh. 
The waitress was so great with recommending wine and dishes. The wine she recommended went so well with the food :))) She was honest about what is popular and not, which made our experience much better. She def made up for the annoying hostesses.  
Overall my experience was great. I will return."}
{"text":"They have the best pizza dough I've ever had! Thin and yet soft. I had the san matteo pizza which has he only downside is that spicy sausage and rapini and the only downside is that the rapini has such a strong taste that it completely overtakes the taste of the sausage. It ends up being a rapini tasting pizza. Caesar salad was delicious. Apart from that, the ambience is great, good service although it took a little waiting before we got pepper for our meals. I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and decor. The decor was very impressive. High ceilings, quirky art on the way to the bathroom, love the private dining areas and the wine selection was great. Then came the food. Nope not worth the price tag. I make waaaay better pasta. I had the seafood linguini. The mussels. ... We'll what mussels ?!? They were big shell no meat, u needed a magnifying glass to find it ! Only 2  shells if clam and the shrimp was so tough! The sauce looks good but missed on something major! U added their hot pepper hoping to make it better but nope. Missing something big.  The chicken broth and egg  drop soup she described as 'light and delicious' nope! It wasn't.  Bland and really it was like broth from a carton and s few green things in it. So blah. Just not worth the money. Service was mediocre, she smiled a few time, sure. But was quick and short. Nope it wasn't busy, it was a wednesday night. But great atmosphere for drinks. You can't screw up a drink."}
{"text":"Reasonable food. Just the right amount of service. 
Astounded by the misogynistic 'art' as my 6 year old daughter and I walk downstairs to the restrooms. Also be prepared bring your own soap as there is none in the dispensers here. I would image with the general cost of food and wine here, soap wouldn't be a problem."}
{"text":"I arranged a trip to Toronto from Michigan for my Book Club's 25th Anniversary so I checked under Trip Advisor for restaurant reviews. Luckily, Arielle I was able to accommodate our group and seat us where all of our tables were in the same vicinity. We loved the food and drink selections!  The service was great!  
Cibo is wonderful!  The restaurant has a nice vibe with everyone engaged in conversation and music playing in the background.. I will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"Great service but the food was on the bland side and came out cold. Air conditioning was broken in the washroom the day we came so that was unpleasant. Appreciated that it was open on July 1st."}
{"text":"5* plus,plus, plus !
Amazing appetizers...I had the grilled octopus...so yummy and my wife had the burrata...which she loves at Cibo.

Mains were pasta with lamb sauce and a pizza...and again, bang on...actually too much food, lol.

My wife and I love Cibo...and will be back again, and again, and again !"}
{"text":"We had a great waitress. Service was prompt. They have delicious homemade bread to start with olives (trust me they are additive!). We shared the bruschetta (delicious), and I had the gigli pasta which was phenomenal. Decor is trendy, place was packed on a Friday night. Would come back. They also have a wine \"wench\", basically a woman in a harness who hoists up to get your bottle of wine. A nice and unique gimmick."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and perfect for a date. Everything tastes tasty and I love their affogato!"}
{"text":"Loved the ambience and the service. Ordered penne arrabbiata and Polenta fries. Wasn't a big fan of their food."}
{"text":"man, this area of king has lots of restaurants with awesome decor. this place caught my eye as a walked by thanks to the floor-to-ceiling wine rack. very cozy atmosphere with the wooden floors, dim lighting, low-archway bathrooms...

rated on food only, I'd give it only 2 stars. unfortunately, nothing to write home about. pretty standard italian stuff, not standout in any way and definitely not worth the price. if you're in the area, I recommend you go to weslodge (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/weslodge-toronto) instead. similar pricing, but food is much more creative and satisfying.

sorry, cibo. you get a skip from me."}
{"text":"Atmosphere of the restaurant was nice. However, our waiter seemed a little condescending and didn't smile the whole night. He didn't ask us if we wanted our bills together or separate and walked off angrily when we asked him to separate it. The food was filling but moderate and the plating was messy and visually unappealing."}
{"text":"Oh yay, another Italian restaurant with innovative menu items like \"polenta fries\" and pizza with walnuts, speck and pears. (That folks, was sarcasm).

Came here with a few friends for a girls' night catch-up dinner. Thankfully, I had stellar company otherwise I would have been disappointed in the evening.

Cocktails were alright. My friends had a very sweet white wine sangria which was full of sliced fruit, I had a bellini and another friend had a caesar.

We were served complementary fresh, warm bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Yeah, kinda boring but better than the shit-on-stick/screw you you get a Terroni. The bread was good and arrived promptly once we placed our order.

Our server was helpful when we asked about a specific wine. Her personality was friendly and appropriate. However, I was irritated that our empty cocktail glasses sat on our table well into receiving out entrée. Sharing plates were brought during our round of apps and I had to collect them and ask for them to be taken to make room on our table.

Our apps were nothing special: deep fried zucchini and artichoke, polenta fries and a pasta e fagioli soup. Obviously, anything deep fried is delicious but the accompanying sauces were potent with garlic (smell ya later) and the polenta fries were pretty standard with bland sauces. The soup tasted as I expected it to, and it was good.

The entrée portions were decent and we all left a bit on our plates, probably because of the food we started with. 

I had one of the fish features: seared ahi tuna with warm sliced grapes, green beans and some kind of eggplant and roasted tomato mush. The fish was OK, but not outstanding. The eggplant and green beans were so salty they were stinging my lips (usually, I'm a salt-lover) and didn't eat much of them. To be honest, I thought the server said grape \"tomatoes\" not actual grapes. The combination on my plate was a little odd and I wished I had ordered something different. 

After dinner, I enjoyed a perfect cappuccino. My friends ordered gelato and some hazelnut chocolate mousse something which was good, very rich and sweet.

All-in-all, Cibo was OK. There was nothing I cared to have again.  The service was on-point, from the hostess desk, to our server and her support staff, and to the manager who visited our table for a quality-check. The only minor issue was lazy table maintenance. The space is attractive, as is the clientele. It's too bad about the food. 

I probably wouldn't recommend this place to any friends. Maybe it's because my mom is Italian, and a superb cook, that I found the food completely uninspiring.  Maybe it's that I'm just bored with Italian restaurants with the same offering of drinks and food (Terroni, Mercato, Ciao, Cibo...).

Their wines don't offer a good value with almost a 400% mark-up on some. That said, the wine was had was good and like I said previously, our server was helpful when we were choosing one.

One final comment. I'm so tired of seeing a Negroni listed. It's becoming the \"chicken fingers and fries\" of cocktail menus."}
{"text":"Delicious, great wine selection, always busy and classy. Easy to accommodate larger parties but also makes a good date night venue. The focaccia bread they give you is scrumptious and easy to want to fill up on. Apps; risotto balls and grilled calamari (nice light and fresh to have if ordering a lot of heavier carbs) both were good, seafood fettucini (2nd time having it, so yummy and large portion) also shared the veal which was massive. Ordered too much for 2 people but enjoyed everything very much."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and my experience was really DISAPPOINTING! 
Our table at second floor was extremely cold. Last time we were at the same spot and it was cold. That time they told us that the problem was with the air conditioner. 
The food quality was terrible in one word. The bread was so salty. The rice in the risotto was raw and the mussels had no spice. The prices are also a bit high. 
I will never come back... what a shame!"}
{"text":"So this was only ok. It was a Saturday nite so the place was jammed. I was with friends so you don't have many options when it comes to service. Our server was delightful & bubbly. 

The food again was just so so. The Caesar salad dressing was watery & tasteless. The pizza was good but had the standard issue....soggy in the middle! I'd go. Ack again but just not order the pizza."}
{"text":"After reading some other reviews, I felt the need to add in my experience. I've been for lunch about a year ago, and I have taken my very Italian parents to dinner here twice over the last few months, and both times we have had good experiences. We have tried multiple dishes at this point, and I would definitely suggest getting a homemade pasta dish, as those seem to be the best. My mom loves the lamb pappardelle, and I really love the gnocchi. The pizza was just ok. I found service fantastic, as our server was incredibly friendly and attentive without being annoying during our meal. We also ended up chatting with a man I believe was a manager, who spoke great Italian, and was super friendly. The only issue with service was with one of the hosts-- she seemed unable to find our reservation for quite some time and somewhat rudely suggested we never made one, but then found the reservation and it was fine. She was pretty rude and honestly seemed super spacey, but has been the only rude person I have ever dealt with there. In response to comments suggesting that this place can be pretentious, I have found that it honestly depends on who else is dining, rather than any of the staff. I've been on a calm day and it was lovely, and I've been during TIFF season and I felt the pretentiousness. I do really like the aesthetic as well-- really cool bar and wine racks, dim but funky lighting. I don't think this is the best Italian food I have ever had, but the homemade pastas are definitely worth the visit, and worth the price, in my opinion. Some other items on the menu seem a bit overpriced, but I went back for the homemade pasta and probably will again."}
{"text":"Cibo is a good choice for dinning on King Street ; 

DECOR 5/5 ; 

The venue feels very spacious. There is a lot of space in between the tables and the whole main dining room feels airy. The exposed bricks and wood beams bring a nice cachet. Some lounge music is playing but its not so loud so you can carry a conversation. 

SERVICE 4.5/5 ; 

Consistently attentive without being too intrusive. They were on time to refill our wine and water glasses. The waitress knew the menu and the busboy was there on time to clear our dishes. 

It took quite a while to get the bread. It actually came after we were served the main dishes. But given the fact it's freshly baked, it's worth the wait. 

FOOD 4.5/5 ; 

To start, I had the grilled calamari (4.5/5). Decent portion server with mixed greens and diced tomatoes. Calamari was well grilled and flavorful. The greens themselves were good with the light touch of olive oil. 

Then I had the Orecchiette (4/5). Nice dish that could be perfected to be amazing ; Pasta tasted fresh and was cooked al dente. Sauce flavorful and the a nice fontina cheese. However there was a lot of fontina and too few parmigiano to get a nice balance.The rapini was slightly overcooked. 

Just like mentioned above, the fresh bread was amazing. Tasty, slightly salty and it makes a great pair with the olive oil and the jarred peppers. 

They do have a wide selection of wine and cocktail and I strongly recommend the Peter Yealands Sauvignon Blanc. Great aroma and taste. 

Pricing is within the average of the downtown core restaurants but it does get you quality food and service."}
{"text":"Cibo wine bar has an awesome patio area looking onto the small streets of Yorkville.  The place makes me feel like I'm dining in a resort restaurant.  There's lots of interesting decor and despite looking quite put together, it still feels quite casual.  I've received excellent service both times I've been here for dinner.

The seafood risotto is a must-have.  The papparadelle is the perfect texture, but the stew was not meaty enough and there was too much fat on the meat.  I asked for additional sauce and the waiter was nice about it.  The spinach salad was a-ok, but it was their warm bread that was divine.

I would come back here for a special event maybe.  I recall from my first dinner experience with them that they have a semi-private room if you have a big group."}
{"text":"Such a great first experience here! We came here for a girls night on a Saturday evening, the food service and the sommelier were fantastic! 

They were so kind and served us multiple orders of the fresh rosemary bread with olives along with our wine. We wanted to have a nice sweet wine with our pasta so the Sommelier suggested a Primitivo which paired beautifully. 

I also tried the Rigatoni, which was so fresh and full of flavour. I would definitely reccomended it!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a middle of the pack price range dinner. It's in an ideal location. Nothing is over the top good but all very good meals or apps"}
{"text":"My family went for Sunday brunch. Service was slow and not attentive. Our seat was dirty from the night before. Bread crumbs were everywhere in the seat. When we ordered coffee, the server brought milk in dirty glass. Things were floating in the glass. Selection of food was okay but except for pasta, there were no flavour and hot dishes were cold ( meatballs, risotto...)
We used Groupon so value was okay but would never pay the full price. Also a glass of posecco or juice is not included. Isn't it called Bubble & brunch Sunday??"}
{"text":"Oh Cibo! You've done me in! What with your 3.5 hr brunch filled with wonderful food and half priced bubbly! 'Intoxicatingly' relaxing! Good service but tables are a bit tight."}

{"text":"I was here for the weekend for Winterlicious with my boyfriend and the food was great. Quality of the service wasn't the greatest, they didn't go above and beyond to meet my expectations when I asked a question. Hostess was rude and unhelpful when it came to my reservations inquiry. Overall, food is fantastic but service can be improved."}
{"text":"Cibo rocks Winterlicious -- dinner was perfection from start to finish! I came here with two girlfriends and I love that this place seems equally ideal for date night or grous. The black tiger shrimp with spicy wine garlic tomato sauce was my favourite appetizer, and all three entrees we ordered were excellent. The ravioli stuffed with lobster, lemon, béchamel, with lobster cream sauce is beyond reproach. Will definitely have to order that the next time I come here. The homemade lemon gelato was like summertime in a spoon -- soo refershing and just perfect after all that comfort food.

Order a few different choices if you're with a group -- portion sizes are great for this price point ($25 for Winterlicious dinner). Service was unwaveringly excellent: not rushed and certainly not lagging. I appreciate they don't pressure you to move along right away once you finish. And did I forget to mention they have an aerialist wine retrieval system. Yes - check out my somewhat blurry photo or go there yourself if you don't believe me. Amazing! 

The noise level is moderate to loud, but I didn't feel the spacing was too close at all, and I love the decor. It's a real standout for the Y&E crowd. Bathrooms are spacious, well-lit, and clean...and don't forget to take advantage of the antique scale in the hallway. Nice touch."}
{"text":"3 stars is most definitely accurate. 


My friends and I had made reservations on a Saturday night for 9:30pm. We made reservations last minute here because it was the only place that had availability on King West. 

Reservations for 9:30pm, and we were sat at 10pm. What's the point of making reservations? 

The manager tried to make things better by giving us Prosecco, but that was ineffective in uplifting my mood - I don't drink.

The food has improved slightly since Cibo opened. 
 1. The Arancini (Rice Balls Stuffed with Ragu + Melted Cheese) were  good, but was a bit dry and needed more \"melted\" cheese. 4 stars.
 2. Prosciutto Di Parma & Arugula Salad - it was fresh, and the meat was  moist. 5 stars.
 3. Puzzi Pizza - I was surprised at how much cheese and how sparse and  minced the Italian sausage was. I was expecting slices of sausage. 3 stars.

Overall, the atmosphere for such a large space does feel intimate and rustic. It's a cheap and convenient spot to go to on King West before a night out. I would not come here if I was looking for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Really really good grilled calamari.  And close to the best linguine with clams In White sauce that I have had. With a decent amarone at a reasonable price (lowest actually).  We will be back."}
{"text":"We went using a Groupon, and the value with the Groupon was fantastic. We would say a bit on the pricey side without it. We went for the Sunday brunch buffet and it was definitely a quality buffet with everything made to order and super fresh.

Lots of fresh cold cuts, pastas made to order, delicious polenta fries, pizzas and omelettes made to order, fabulous waffles, cakes, fruit and other desserts and mimosas!!

Some downsides would be that the buffet spreads out over three floors so if stairs arent your thing, you better hope someone with you doesnt mind getting your food for you. Im not sure if there was an elevator, and of course the restaurant is only a buffet for part of the day on Sundays, so any other time this wouldnt be an issue!!

On a positive note, all of those stairs burns calories between courses!!

We would go back!!::))"}
{"text":"Been here 3x and every time has been a total hit. The calzone is huge and tasty!  The pasta made in house and isn't drenched in sauce... you can taste every ingredient.  Kim was our server last time we were there and is very knowledgeable on the menu and wine. Well return over and over again"}
{"text":"Love this place! Ordered the grilled calamari and lamb spiedini. Great location and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm kind of embarrassed to admit I've never been to any of the CIBO locations.... But after going to this one I think I'm obsessed. The decor is so trendy and beautiful...it makes you feel like you're out of town in NYC or somewhere chic. If you're lucky you'll see the wine girls get harnessed up and propel down the huge wine wall to get a bottle. Now the menu is huge... So many options.... Pizza. Pasta. Fish. Chicken. Salads. My goal is too try it ALLLLLLL!!!!!.... The service was great, the prices are too be expected not cheap but not insane. Great place for date night or birthdays or anything. But please do make a reservation!!!!"}
{"text":"Great modern decor, great ambiance, great food variety on menu, good service. Dishes served us freshly made, with good presentation. 
A vast selection of wines,  a high rise wine stack, with \"cirque de soleil\" retrieval of bottles by waitress. 
Tiramisu \"to die for,\" Calamari very good, Rigatoni and Lobster Ravioli excellent, Chocolate Bombe fantastic...
Bread served with olives and hot peppers...."}
{"text":"Good location. Horrible customer service, servers are rude and unprofessional. Left within 10mins of entering restaurant. Will try another location to test food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I made a reservation for 2 on a Friday evening around 6 PM. LOVED the ambiance and atmosphere, perf date spot and service is top-notch.

Our waiter was knowledgable about the menu. Explained to us what was made fresh in house and what was imported from Italy. My boyfriend and I ordered:

9/10 Black tiger shrimp in a spicy wine garlic tomato sauce
- Loved it, but the pricing is too high for 5 shrimps ($17)
8/10 Chianti Braised Short Ribs 
- So tender, the meat fell right off the bones. The reason I didn't give it at 10/10 is because the blue cheese is strong in the mashed potatoes and I'm not a fan of onion rings :p Overall, highly recommend!
6/10 Margherita Pizza
- Went to Italy in Apr and I'm a die-hard fan of margherita pizzas now so... needless to say, I'm determined to try every single margherita pizza in Toronto and this one here isn't authentic. Cheese and dough was off.

Def coming back as there's a lot of options on the menu :)"}
{"text":"The service at Cibo Wine Bar was excellent.
It is definitely not within my price range but I went here with two friends for appetizers and drinks and I was really impressed with how unobtrusive, attentive, and diligent our server was.
The bruscetta we had was pretty good but really big and hard to eat. The wine was delicious, of course.
We went on a Friday night and it was packed. I think it closes around midnight or 1. We were the last ones in the restaurant but never felt pressured to leave.
Would recommend."}
{"text":"Okay so the setting is lovely. The service is attentive. All else is dissapointing. Average food. Needlessly expensive. Nothing to write about. Yes it's King west but there are way better on this street. Quite dissapointing."}
{"text":"Great night at Cibo with my friend! I will list the great and then the not so great! 

1) The restaurant is beautiful, clean and my friend and I could speak easily without having to strain our voices! 
2) Our server (wish I knew her name she was an actor she told us) was wonderful! Very knowledgable, kind and attentive! She was honestly one of the best servers I've had, and service goes a LONG way for my dining experiences. Again, wish I remembered her name so she could get some recognition on here, blurgh! 
3) The bread they give at the beginning was absolutely delicious! Not too salty, and served with chilies soaked in oil and olives! 
4) The prices are quite good for the portions you get. 

Okay, the not so good. 

1) Upon entering the restaurant, the first impression I got was five chattering girls at the hostess station, talking amongst themselves very unprofessionally. They eventually greeted me very informally without a smile, and it was a jarring intro to Cibo. 
I was bracing myself for a night of bad service but thank God that wasn't the case! 
2) My spaghetti with seafood in a light tomato sauce (I subbed out the linguine for their homemade pasta) was just mediocre. The noodles itself were delicious and perfectly cooked, but the sauce wasn't too flavourful, and my tiger prawns were extremely overcooked and rubbery. 
I wish I could give 1/2 stars, which in case it would have been a 3.5, but alas. I think I would come back and give it another go though in the future. Perhaps the chef who made my food was having an off night?!?"}
{"text":"Decent service. Not great but not terrible. Large selection of wine and an expansive menu."}
{"text":"What saved this place a star is decent service and decor. The food was a sad effort for a restaurant of this caliber. We had booked a private room and had over a dozen platters sent to us. Out of all the dishes we had one was ok. The pizza was good."}
{"text":"Came here for a winterliciois culinary event. It was a fun night filled with good food and wine. The event was advertised as an italian bread making class and the ticket was $65pp. The night started with foccacia bread demos by the executive chef at cibo, and then appetizers were brought out and shared among the whole table, which included fried risotto balls, charcuterie/cheese board, salad, and polenta fries. My favourites were the risotto balls and polenta fries (must try)! We then got a chance to decorate our own foccacia bread to bring home. Main courses (pasta, ribs and risotto) were served afterwards and the night ended with a chocolate baci bomb dessert. The food was delicious and we enjoyed the entire dining experience a lot. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"First the good: amazing decor, really great ambiance, spacious, very nice rooms, super neighbourhood, fish main meal portions large, Now the bad:  really average food, Cannelloni ok, Tagliatelle below average (pesto not up to par), carpaccio app bland and missing a little zing, eggplant Parmesan app also very average.  If we were here just for drinks would have been a five star experience, but we were not"}
{"text":"This seems to be quite the hot spot for dinner and wine in Toronto. We came for dinner and had a reservation. The space is beautiful with rustic wood, industrial lights, tall tables and dim lighting. The space is also quite huge and when you enter, you are graced with the presence of their huge glass wine room. 

We were seated in the bar area, (we had a party of 5) at a tall table. I was kind of hoping we'd get a shorter table, but no mind. Our server took our drink order, read off some specials and then left us to mull over the menu. I ordered a Negroni drink to start and then we got a few appetizers with our food:
* 2 orders polenta fries
* 1 ordered funghi platter
The polenta was delicious and the mushrooms were meaty and seasoned well. The bread that also comes to the table was so delicious.
The drinks were good and strong, too!
For dinner I ordered their seasonal risotto with vegetables and it was so creamy and cooked to perfection. 

They have a wide variety of pastas and Italian main plates and a lot of options can be made vegetarian and also made with gluten-free pasta. For dessert we split a Nutella pizza and the tiramisu.

Where this place gets docked points is the service. We hardly saw our server and probably had 3-4 different people check in on us, serve our food, refill drinks, deliver the bill, etc."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon for brunch buffet so I went with 3 of my girlfriends. I've also been here 2 months ago with my Dad. But this is the first review I'm writing. 

FOOD (Brunch):
Waffles: I enjoyed them with the fresh (real) cream, maple syrup and berry compote as well as fresh fruit on the side. But my girlfriends found the waffles too spongy. They would have preferred a crispier outside and softer inside they said. 

Omelet station: I didn't order any omelet but one of my girlfriend's got scrambled eggs and another got one egg sunny side up. I did have some of their bacon and a fingerling potato on the side of my waffles. 

Bacon: there is plenty of it but each time I've been the bacon hasn't had much flavour or crunch to it. 

Cheese and deli meat table: the cheeses are great from blue cheese with walnuts and honey to Parmesan. The deli meats are hit or miss. For example my friend got prosciutto as it was freshly sliced and she said it was delicious. I went 20 mins later and the was a new ham on the slicer and the prosciutto tasted rancid unfortunately.  The blue Concord grapes were a nice garnish at the cheese station. 

Seafood: they have mussels (today they were dried up) and a cold spring salad (decent) as well as very very small ramekins with cream cheese and a small
Piece of smoked salmon and one caper. Today the smoked salmon was dried up. 

Red meat: today's meat was a leg of lamb and I had a small piece of that - it tasted a bit over cooked. And the Dijon mustard sauce is the same they had for the beef. 

Dessert: dark chocolate cake sounded good and it was decent (nothing that would make you want to go back for 2nd). And the chocolate mousse cake had no flavour. 

Alcoholic beverages: the sparkling wines where 1/2 off and my girl friends' enjoyed the selection. 

The coffee was meh. The OJ was decent ($4).

Ambience was nice - modern rustic. 

Service: hit or miss at times eg I was without a water top up for 20 mins. Took awhile to get our bill after they had taken down the Groupon info. 

Would I recommend to a friend? Only if they loved to eat large quantities and had never been there. 

Would I come again? Twice is more than enough. 

We got to talking & wondered where is a good place for brunch in Toronto anymore (does not have to be a buffet)?"}
{"text":"Great place to go with friends or as a casual date night."}
{"text":"I didn't pay attention when I booked it and they have buffet service on Sundays which I'm not a fan of.

The main floor was booked for a very large private party  ... I'm not sure if they added tables but it was almost impossible to get to the food stations on that level.. Freshly made pizza was very good (their pizza is always good). Roast beef was good. Good waffles.

Not worth the $35 per person. Half price on glasses of sparkling wine."}
{"text":"Always pleasant and have amazing crave-worthy oven made pizza! Very sophisticated vibe."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Friday night without a reservation and they were accommodating with only 20 minute wait for a table for 4. We had a mixture of pasta fresca's and pizza and the food was amazing. The service was friendly and attentive. Definite 5 star deserved."}
{"text":"Great interior, terrible food! Went with some friends last night, and had to send back two dishes. 

Ordered the lobster ravioli and it was bland, then ordered the trout and it was under cooked and poorly done. 

We were given a complimentary dessert platter; while I appreciate the gesture, it was sub-par. I really expected better."}
{"text":"amazing in-house made pizza and pasta!!!!!!! love the bread"}
{"text":"I love this place! 
Came here today for a quick lunch and was really impressed. For $9 I got a delicious Pesto Chicken Panini. It was extremely tasty and came with a side salad that was to die for. My date ordered the steak panini and was equally happy. I always avoid ordering steak sandwiches for fear of fatty chewy gristly bits. There were none in this yummy sandwich. 
We both ordered a glass of Chardonnay ($8) which was perfectly fine for the price. Ambiance and service both great. 
I plan to bring all my work friends back for lunch very soon."}
{"text":"My experience here was at best 'meh'. We began with the arancinni, three came and two were cold while the remaining was hot. I ordered the lasagna and I wasn't a fan, I didn't finish it. My friend ordered some linguini with seafood and that tasted better but still not worth the price. We then ordered tiramisu for dessert and it was bland. The best part of the meal was the two tiny pieces of biscotti that came with the tiramisu. The servers were good, but disorganised. Sometimes we would get one server after another asking us the same questions or we would get no one when we needed them. The worst part was the seats, the tables were very high as well as the chairs, and the backs of the chairs were too low to lean back so we were practically slouching in our chairs the whole time. The restaurant looks nice but that's about it."}
{"text":"A few of us went there Saturday evening for dinner.  My second time returning.  Ordered the beef ribs, they were delicious AGAIN!  This time, bigger than the first time I ordered.  Simply amazing!  The puree was delicious as well.  Everything on that plate is divine!!!

The ambiance is beautiful as can be.  The service needs some work.  We had about 3 servers at our table and they seemed to always forget something.  First was the cutlery lol  Can't really eat with our hands at such a nice restaurant, wouldn't be right.

Definitely can't wait to go again! regardless of the lack of service."}
{"text":"Attended for a bachelorette this past weekend (party of 10).

Worked with Alexandra who put together a wonderful menu for us and customized headings on the menus.

When we arrived the hostesses at the front had some confusion with how many guests there were but once I advise them that I had confirmed 10 everything worked out.

The food was amazing. We had such a great selection and everything was wonderful. 

The polenta fries are off the charts...an absolute fav!!!

Two complaints from my crew was that the sauce on the chicken Parmesan tasted like right out of the can and it did not taste homemade and that there was too much truffle oil in the risotto.

At $55 a person I think that this is a wonderful price point for all the food that we received.

The wine selection was amazing and we bought a bottle of Chilean wine which was delicious.

I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Friday after my city hall wedding ceremony. Didn't make reservations, but our party of 9 was seated promptly. Food was delicious, and this was unanimously agreed upon by my husband's visiting Italian family. One of the guest's pizza arrived a bit later than our entrees so the chef gave us a complimentary dessert platter. Great dining experience, beautiful restaurant, yummy food and excellent service. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was always underwhelmed by the service at Ciao but enjoyed the food anyway and the same goes for Cibo. I stopped going to Ciao, however, because I got tired of the service. Ciao closed and the owners did some makeovers and reopened as Cibo. Same menu and , sadly, same abysmal service. Beautiful decor, great food and neglectful servers. 

We (regretfully) arrived almost fifteen minutes late for our reservation thanks to the pouring rain and difficulty getting a cab. Our party of two was escorted downstairs to what appeared to be a table for 6. When we asked why we had such a big table for two people in a busy restaurant at 7:30 on a Saturday night we were told that others would be seated. When we asked why or if we could move our table the response was \"this is how it is\". REALLY - this is how it is?!? Unacceptable response. 

We shared some starters and ordered just tap water and a bottle of red wine. It was an $80 bottle. The bottle took almost 15 minutes to find its way to us, it was uncorked and poured and placed on the table. The servers then ignore the bottle the ENTIRE EVENING. No attention to empty glasses or top up. We did it ourselves. We also had to ask for more water. Several. Times - with only one refill the entire night to a total of two glasses of water. The starters and the GF pasta were very good. No dessert because the only GF friendly dessert was gelato on a chilly, wet October Saturday night (no thanks). My friend had water splashed on her and a fork dropped off the table onto her shirt from two separate servers. 

Cibo, this is YORKVILLE. There are a number of mid to high end restaurants that are happy to provide water, knowledgeable service and attentive top ups of wine glasses for the same quality of food and price as you're charging. You need to step it up because right now your reno's to take you from Ciao to Cibo are lipstick on a pig and I would rather visit the competition to be served appropriately."}
{"text":"3.5 

This is a beautiful restaurant in the heart of Yorkville. For a Tuesday night, it was pretty busy but certainly not full. The food was not bad, not the best I've ever had but definitely above average and the service was pretty good!

I had a glass of the Pinot Grigio which I enjoyed. I notice the list of white wines was a bit smaller. There were a lot more red wine choices and most of the choices were for entire bottles. The prices were a bit on the higher side but it's a beautiful restaurant in Yorkville so that's to be expected.

I had the spinach salad which was good but I found there were too many sweet elements. The salad dressing was a strawberry vinaigrette and there were figs and dried cranberries and some sort of crispy onions and bocconcini cheese. I would have enjoyed a goats cheese or something to cut the sweetness of it. The elements were fresh tasting however. We also ordered the burrata appetizer that came with a sizable ball of burrata cheese and prosciutto on a bed of arugula. The burrata was delicious and the portion was good for the price. 

I had the gnocchi as my main, which while was filling, was a small portion on a huge plate. I saw some other dishes like the lasagna and pizzas and panzerotti and they were a lot larger. Maybe I'd go with one of those options next time. The pasta was also somewhat mediocre in my opinion, the sauce wasn't the best and the ricotta on top didn't really add much to it. 

Since we were there for a birthday, we also got a Nutella pizza to share. I love Nutella so that was good but I found the crust to be really chewy in some parts and burnt in other parts. There were also a total of 5 banana slices on the pizza and a few hazelnuts sprinkles on top. It was a nice after dinner treat but it wasn't amazing. 

The service was pretty good. The food came a bit slow but it's not a fast food restaurant so you can't expect that. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. Modern and warm and stylish. The kitchen is open so you can see the pizzas being made which is really cool. 

Overall this is a nice spot for dinner. The prices are on the higher side but not outrageously so, especially for the area. It's definitely a cool, stylish place with pretty good food. The ambience is really what I'd come back for, and maybe the lasagna!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was great! Staff was nice, food came out fast, called to confirm our reservation time. I ordered the lobster linguini and as an appetizer we got the arancini (which I would 100% recommend for anyone). Perfect for a date night or a special occasion! I'd give my experience an overall 5/5 cibos"}
{"text":"A favourite of ours in the city for sure! Elegant and inviting atmosphere in the core of King St Toronto. Food is amazing, from the appetizers to the mains to the drinks! Always a good time when we are at CIBO."}
{"text":"Polenta fries are a must try!! Also ordered bruschetta, grilled calamari, seared tuna, mushroom risotto & tiramisu. The apps & entrees were very good. Not a fan of the tiramisu. Those polenta fries are going to be my new addiction!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful evening.
I was spontanious on a Friday evening and had a great time. 
The interiour of this place is outstanding. Rather less, connection of modern wood and history of the building.
Service was perfect. Fast and on the spot (I did order from the girls. No IPads here).
Food? Excellent. I had grilled vegie and spagethi carbonara. Certain pasta (not spagethi) they do by their own and use semolina! This is pasta!
Excellent wine list with coctails on top.
Dolci and espresso also perfect.

Come and enjoy. Alone, with a date or couple friends. You'll have great time here!

Clear recommandation!"}
{"text":"On the line between 4 and 5 stars. I always round down. 

Location/ambiance (5 stars): Awesome getaway on a street full of clubs. Beautiful ambiance with a wall of wine and open kitchen. 

Service (5 stars): Our waitress was incredible. Super attentive and spot on recommendations for wine and food. We were going to order the lobster ravioli, and she steered us against it even though it was the most expensive pasta entree and in her best interest for us to get it. As we were paying, she gave recommendations for other things to do in and around Toronto. 

Food (4 stars):
- cheese board was incredible. 4 cheeses and two pairings for each. 
- My husband said the Carpaccio was excellent, though I discovered I'm not the biggest fan... 
- caprese had super fresh cheese. I like more balsamic, but overall decent. 
- The pasta is where it fell flat. We got the tagliatelle and the lamb dish. Both were slightly undercooked and under seasoned. We put in the orders just before the kitchen closed, so maybe they were rushing? However, these were the entrees, so I was a bit disappointed... 

Overall, I wish I could give this place a 5, but it could have been even better. Would recommend and return."}
{"text":"I have not a compliant. Great service, great food, great wine. I really enjoyed the ambiance of this hip and mod-casual wine bar."}
{"text":"Brunch at this location was good.  The service was spotty at first but after we changed tables to a roomier booth and a new waitress everything was great.  You see the first waitress didn't want to move us but the table was just too cramped in its configuration.

The set up here is set on three split levels with stations for eggs, breakfast stuff downstairs, lamb on the main floor, and Italian goodies on the top floor which included pizza, pasta, anti-pasti...etc.

As a whole the service was great while the food was okay - nothing special but an enjoyable place to have brunch with friends.

Oh yes - the tile floor in the restaurant is ever slightly slick, I even asked my friends if it was just me or they found it slick as well.  It's slick - use the handrails.  Hopefully the management will check out that floor."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. 

Came here for an event during summerlicious, but did not get the summerlicious menu. The event was hosted in their private dining hall under the main restaurant floor. 

The made in house bread was great. Everything else was ok...

Presentation of the appetizers (pizza and veggies), main (salmon), and desserts (cheesecake) was nice, but the actual food taste was sub par. There are comparable salmon dishes elsewhere in the city."}
{"text":"I typically take photos of EVERYTHING I eat when I go out.  Tonight was an exception.  

Dinner at CIBO lived up to my expectations (via Yelp reviews).  Everything looked amazing but tasted underwhelming.  

For starters, they bring you a delicious loaf of bread.  Likely ciabatta (assuming based on the name of the restaurant). It's topped with rosemary and salt.  It was amazing. 

I followed that up with a minestrone soup.  It was huge.  Packed with vegetables, I mean way overloaded.  The broth was good but there wasn't much of it. It was served hot which was a huge plus.  

I then had the seared ahi tuna arugula salad.  This is where the experience went sour.  Or should I say salty.  Wow.  The tuna was tasteless other than an enormous amount of salt.  Granted I'm not sure it stemmed from the tuna, however something in that salad was drenched in salt.  It must have been the tuna.   

The service was excellent.  The waitress was very friendly and the atmosphere was great.  Everything looked amazing.  

Worth a try, do some research before going as I would imagine they have better dishes on their menu"}
{"text":"Had lunch today with co-workers to celebrate a new employee joining our team. I ordered the lunch special - Caesar salad & tagliatelle pasta with rapini. The food was phenomenal but I have to say that our server looked like we were annoying her.  When I asked her where the restroom was she rolled her eyes like t was a really irritating question. 
Food is great here but Cibo wine bar, what kind of recruitment process do you have? 
Just saying!"}
{"text":"I went to Cibo for Summerlicious yesterday and I am already planning to come back. The service was a little slow but the food was tasty and the staff were friendly."}
{"text":"Our team from work chose to go here expecting a middle of the road experience, and it might have been that as the food was okay, but bad service really hurt the experience.  One of the dishes amongst four others was late by 15-20 minutes. Everyone else waited and their food was cold because the waiter assured us the other dish would be out in a few minutes. If the waiter had just been honest about them forgetting the dish, we would have all moved forward and started our other dishes earlier. At the end, they didn't even take the dish off the bill.  

During the dinner the waiter kept getting in-between our conversation across the table. I get that he was doing his job, but he seemed to be leaning across our table the entire time he was there without ever acknowledging that he was interrupting. Lastly, as we were brought coffee at the end, it took a good 5-10 minutes before we had the accoutrements to finish the job...you know cream and sugar etc. Who brings coffee without cream?  The setting was nice. The food was just okay. The service was bad.  I tipped 13% in the end, but in retrospect, I was kind of upset with myself for leaving that much. Toronto is an expensive city for service workers, but was that appropriate?"}
{"text":"Plenty of reviews here but overall the ambiance is really nice and cozy yet lots of space between tables and different sections to sit in that are comfortable with great decor.

Service was pretty strong - no complaints at all, very friendly and attentive.  

We had a roasted chicken chicken dinner where the chicken was a bit on the dry side not really juicy at all so I wouldn't recommend this dish.  

I had fettuccine Alfredo with chicken added.  It was just ok. Nothing to shout about.  the polenta fries are definitely a hit as I'm sure others have mentioned.

All in all the ambiance and service out weighed the food"}
{"text":"This review is only for the bar area.  

I can see why many people like Cibo.  The atmosphere is really nice.  In the King St location, there is nice exposed brick, lots of large timber to give that restoration look, dimmed lighting, and one thing I do love, wonderfully spaced out tables!

We sat at the bar and service was very quick... it was also a very slow Sunday so maybe only 6 other people were there.  The staff was friendly and knew how to joke with everyone to keep the mood light and fun.  I have to admit the guy bartender was having a bit of an off day as he was dropping drinks while shaking them or accidentally knocking bottles over... but it kept us entertained.  

The prices are reasonable for King st as well.. it definitely has a higher price tag than you average place but comparing to Baro, Frings or other neighbours, it definitely is a good spot since you have a nice atmosphere and reasonably priced items.  We didnt get to try out any food but I'll be willing to come back and see if it can reach up to a 4 star!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a business conference looking for a nice place to have dinner. Walked by Cibo and thought the interior was nice and we all wanted wine so we went in. It was crowded on a Sunday night and was going to be 1/2 hour wait so we opted to wait at the bar. It took 15 minutes to get our wine after I asked for a couple of tastes so I could decide. I don't think the bar tender appreciated that I asked for samples. He was rude and inattentive. After we were seated it took the waitress 10 minutes to acknowledge us. Now, onto the food. The free bread they offer is quite good and that's the only thing that is. We ordered the Margherita pizza, a chicken pasta dish and another chicken pizza. As many other reviewers have said, the Margherita pizza is basically a thin crust with some tomato sauce and cheese. Ours didn't even have basil on it. When we told the waitress about it she brought us a few leaves of fresh basil. In the end we left half of it behind and asked her to remove it from our bill, which she did. 

The food and drinks here are overpriced and so not worth the quality (or lack thereof) of the food. I will never, ever be returning to Cibo."}
{"text":"Polenta Fries ($9)
These were quite tasteless, really relied on the sauces to add flavor to the fries. Wasn't much of my liking. They were really crispy though. One was a chessy sauce which was a really good dip for the fries, the other was a spicy salsa which was unexpectedly quite spicy.

Lobster Ravioli ($21)
Ravioli stuffed with lobster, lemon, and béchamel in lobster cream sauce. I did not taste any lemon flavor inside. I was expecting chunks of lobster in the ravioli, but that was not the case. The sauce was like a lobster bisque sauce which was good, but they could have gave more since the ravioli itself wasn't too flavorful. The pasta ends were slightly hard, a bit too raw for my liking when it comes to ravioli. With this dish supposedly being the recommended pasta, I found it quite disappointing.

Funghi Pizza ($19)
Of all items that we tried through the night, this Funghi pizza tasted the best - topped with Wild mushrooms, fontina cream, white truffle oil. Loved the pieces of portobello mushroom on top. The pie was thin, chewy but with a nice doughy crisp. The pizza was well flavored, really liked the white sauce base as well. All the ingredients complemented each other really well. I think this funghi pizza tasted better than the one I had at Jamie Oliver.

The atmosphere of this place was really nice, but the food is just average and the restaurant's  lack of service was disappointing. What really bothered me was no one came by to refill our cups of water so I went and took the bottled water myself nearby and poured it in my cup. As I was pouring a waiter came by to take away our plates but didn't offer to help me pour the water as they normally do. 
Overall, it's really the pizza that saved the dinner. I don't think I'd be coming back."}
{"text":"A little late on reviewing; but did pay a visit for winterlicious for the dinner option. There were definitely some hits but a lot of misses sadly. First off walking in; decor is just gorgeous! Stunning actually with a rustic yet modern finish with a beautiful wine case display to rave about. The beauty had just left me in awe and I couldn't wait to be seated and dig in! In terms of he menu; we had tried the polenta fries and the tiger shrimp as the appetiser. The polenta fries... Large portion; definitely a sharer but although large in flavour; didn't speak much volumes in flavour unfortunately. Even a dash of salt would have worked wonders. It was accompanied with sauces but unless drenched; it just didn't help. The tiger shrimp had a tangy taste that is great for seafood lovers but I can't say it's he best I've had. Mains... There was one main that blew everything else out the water. The braised beef short rib on polenta and blue cheese was to die for. The meet fell off the bone perfectly and the polenta here was nice and creamy and flavoured to perfection and didn't overpower the star of the dish; the beautiful beef. I'd def come back for this main and it's also a large portion! The lobster ravioli on the other hand was basically he opposite. I was very sad at this! The plate arrived with 4 pieces of ravioli and this would have been sufficient if the filling was packed. When having a smaller portion your looking at meaty chunks of succulent lobster but I found it was ground to the point of indistinguishable measure. The sauce was tasty though but there wasn't enough to cost the ravioli at all making the dish rather dry. And the pasta was a tad uncooked. I prefer al Dente pasta but this was just too chewy. Finally dessert! The blood orange semi fredo was just amazing finished with some pomegranate seeds; perfect finish. But the chocolate hazelnut risotto was hands down the most off putting dessert I've ever had. When you hear risotto; you'd think smooth, warm, creamy; boy was I far from wrong. I was like old stale rice pudding. Hard and tasteless. Almost made to be masked by the oodles of whip cream on top and caramel sauce.. It was just so off putting that 2 of us didn't get past that first bite. Brutal I know! Saying that this restaurant had some hits and misses. Order their highly recommended and popular dishes and their pizzas; steer away from being adventurous at this joint! You'll be glad!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever, made a reservation for 12:30 and had to wait extra 45 min to seat down and the food was mediocre, very bad hospitality and rude hostest, management did not do anything too. Do not eat at this place"}
{"text":"A bit noisy and lots of business dinner parties there but service is ok and there are aome good menu items such as the lobster ravioli or pizzas with good chewy dough. Hence a decent 3.5 going to 4"}
{"text":"Nice ambience, good but not great service, food was pretty tasty. Overall, it's worth a try.

Prosciutto and formaggio: meat was really delicious and salty, cheese was really fresh and complemented the meat. Olives were yummy. Presentation was spot on as well.

Fried zucchini and artichokes: these are deep fried and battered. But that's how I like my veggies.

Lasagna: highly recommend it, has salumi and is really filling and delicious. 

CIBO martini: with crystal head! No alcohol taste, was very sweet. Grapes a nice touch.

Sangria: perfect presentation, was very satisfying."}
{"text":"I cannot speak highly enough of Cibo! I've heard amazing things about Gusto 101, but the wait times are horrendous and they do not take reservations- Cibo sounded great to me and you can make a reservation online, so I was all over it!

I made a reservation for 8pm on a Friday- we were celebrating our (surprise) engagement, so I made that quick note in the reservation. When we arrived, the place was absolutely packed, but we arrived right on time so we were seated immediately. Our waitress congratulated us on our engagement and brought us out some champagne on the house to celebrate. What a nice touch!

At an Italian restaurant, you expect to start the meal with bread, and Cibo did not disappoint in that department. Excellent fresh bread to start the meal, and a side of olives for all you olive lovers out there. We also has the rice ball appetizer which was delicious! Very crispy exterior, and a super cheesy interior, cooked to perfection.

For the entree, I enjoyed the lobster ravioli. Ordering that dish can be a gamble because you never know how generous a restaurant is going to be with the lobster meat, but Cibo very generously stuffed their ravioli full of lobster meat. The portion was a bit small, I think 6 ravioli or so, but they were large and stuffed very well, so it ended up being quite filling along with the bread and appetizer!

My experience here was fantastic- I may be a bit biased due to the nature of my visit, but I had an incredible meal, the staff was so friendly, and the ambiance was great! I did read that Cibo was \"casual\" but I definitely felt as though it was a fancier place. The ambiance is on the upscale side, and we were surrounded by people who were very nicely dressed in their best weekend outfits. No complaints from me, but be prepared if you dine here on a weekend and arrive underdressed!"}
{"text":"Very meh. Pasta was too hard, salad was not good, service was slow. Wouldn't come here again if I had a choice. Patios not bad though?"}
{"text":"Came back for my second try of their Sunday brunch this past weekend (both visits were due to friends who bought Groupons).

Both times were meh....it was the company and the fun of going for brunch that made it worthwhile, but definitely not the food.

The food is decent, but nothing beyond that. I would still always choose from the many brunch restaurants that Toronto has to offer for my next outing over this place.

They offer pasta, polenta fries, salads, pizza, waffles, omlet (yuk yuk - stay away!), an array of desserts...

Place is nicely decorated and servers are nice.

The one off-putting part was when they gave us the bill and forgot to enter the Groupon promo (which they eventually fixed) - their regular price (which I was totally unaware of) came to $80 (pre tip) for two people. $80 for mediocre brunch buffet for two people?!...insane... For that money you can have a stellar brunch with lotssss of booze at many other downtown places. Crazy. 

Not to mention the tip option on the credit card machine starts at 18%...I get it's King West but really? It's a buffet. Here is 18% for not being my server since ITS A BUFFET. lol....

not going back!"}
{"text":"We came here with a group, and thoroughly enjoyed our food. We received a bunch of smaller dishes, shared for the large table of 12 people. Particular highlights was the olive bread and the bread/cheese sticks. The flank steak was also amazing. Service was also quite good.

The restaurant loses points for its group options, however. We were told there was a private room, and had planned an educational talk. Unfortunately, the private room had half the wall open to the restaurant, and it was very loud! It was very difficult to hear the speaker. In addition, the room (and possible the full bar) was VERY VERY hot. We were all sweating by the end.

Still, the food is good, and the atmosphere is pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Went here with the office for our annual party and I expected decent food. We went with the party menu which was set with shared apps and a choice of 4 different mains. 

From the time we sat down, our server at the bar appeared frazzled and took forever to get drinks set,made and served.  I tried the Italian Greyhound for my first drink, not only did it take 30 minutes to get to me, it came with 4 extra fruit flies on it.

I twitted about it and was asked to DM so that they could speak to the management about it.

After about an hour or so of waiting for all of our coworkers to get there, we then headed downstairs into the private room which I have to say have one of the coolest decor/ambiance I have been in.

They started to serve the Palenta fries which was shared between everyone.  It was alright, bland and the marinara dip tasted like something you could get from Loblaws.

The second starter they served was the pizza.  The crust was good, but if you eat the pizza with the toppings you will be met with the saltiest things ever.  So... needless to stay, I just ate the crust.

The third starter was a platter of mini meatballs, tiger shrimps and the risotto balls which was basically an upscale cafeteria food.  

For an Italian place, the meatballs tasted like a frozen dinner meatloaf rolled up into little balls.  

Next served was the salad and the tomato and cheese appetizer.  These 2 I believe was the only ones I was able to eat with no problem although I think the salt that tomato/cheese app needed all was put into the Pizza.

The mixed mushroom appetizer came next and was ok.  It seemed fresh and was nice.

For the main, I chose the Fettucine, which came with Shrimps, pesto, mascarpone cheese and a touch of tomato sauce.

I won't hold back on my review because honestly, for an upscale place, I was hoping to be blown away.  The pasta was WAY overdone, there was a mixture of frozen package shrimps and the tiger shrimps so the cook on both were totally off.  I think that I would have had a better tasting pasta from the cooked food section of a Loblaws. I could not, for the love of God eat more than a bite full of this \"italian pasta\".

The Chef's selection of deserts however was good.  I think aside from the deserts, decor and the people I was with, nothing else was good.  

At the end of the night, I had to go grab dinner at Sushi Inn just so that I could have a proper Dinner.

Unfortunately, coming here with expectations and only being underwhelmed was a very big disappointment to me and my friends.  I would hope that in the future, they taste their food prior to serving them to their patrons.

{"text":"Decided to give Cibo another shot and see if they've worked the kinks out. I think they have -- both the service and food were noticeably better, and the by-the-glass wine selection was a bit improved (but still not much, and is disappointing considering this is called Cibo *Wine Bar*). 

That said, the crowd here on a Friday night was super douchey. (Par for the course in Toronto, really, which is possibly the douchiest city in the world.) I'll likely be back but stick to Monday-Wednesday."}
{"text":"Overpriced and crowded. Decent food  and nice choice of wine. Service was good and friendly."}
{"text":"Good alcohol, very bad food. We got their risotto that was alright. We tried a different type of pasta too and it was completely undercooked. The fries were really bad. Other than the location and wine we got, there was nothing good about it. If you go on Thursdays between 4-7 pm, I think the wine is half price but not sure whether that happens every week."}
{"text":"Great and good looking environment, OK food, good service. Great wine selection. 

Spicy Italian sausage was very spicy in contrast to the waiteress's recommendation."}
{"text":"Very busy. But the decor, drinks and food were great. Great service. A little on the pricy side."}
{"text":"I went on a Wednesday evening. It was pretty busy but we still had excellent service. Our server was very friendly and had a charming personality. The food was delicious. I had the Gorgonzola pizza and my husband had the pasta with Italian Sausage. The wine and the atmosphere made for a really nice evening out. We would love to go back again some time."}
{"text":"Wine is delicious, pasta is good too. Don't skip a chocolate mousse dessert! Sooooooo good! Salads can be better! Anyways, friendly and charming inside:)"}
{"text":"Nice decor and atmosphere but food is very average. Bland pasta. Service very poor. Awful seats - make sure you get regular chair, not low couch seats (impossible to eat)."}
{"text":"Went here for an office team lunch with about 15 people! This restaurant is huge and has beautiful ambiance...accommodating 15 to 17 people was very easy for them. However, they weren't able to keep up with such a large order. We had to wait for a long long time for our food to be served. We had about 1.5hours for lunch in between our workshop and we had to exceed that.  So clearly, if you are in time crunch and are a big party, avoid this place!
On the contrary, if you're just up for some good food, good wine and a good time with someone and you don't have any time restrictions,  this place is definitely worth a try. Everything that we ordered came in big portions and tasted fantastic. We all returned with happy tummies! You can totally rely on the servers suggestions as well because a few of them from my group went with the suggestions and it was really really good!"}
{"text":"This location is centrally located within the heart of downtown (King Street West) and it's only a few minutes to walk there from King and Spadina.  The restaurant is supremely modern and has a nice ambience to it when dining or at the bar.

I highly recommend the Tagliatelle which has bolognese sauce and parmigiana reggiano. Cibo overall has amazing cuisine that would suffice any dinner craving. The service could also be better but nothing to complain about!! Definitely try it out if you're in the area looking for some food to fill you up."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here but the service was just so-so. I think since the food was so good it completely makes the experience worth it. I went with a group of six and had several appetizers and meals. I had the salmon and can highly recommend it. I also had a house Cabernet (that took forever to receive) and I regret saying it was pretty disappointing for a wine bar. Overall, great food"}
{"text":"I recently attended Cibo Wine Bar for dinner with my boyfriend. We were seated upstairs in a nice and comfortable area. The atmosphere was vibrant and relaxed. Our server Chris (if I recall his name correctly) was excellent. He was very friendly and gave excellent service. He explained the dishes to us and made great suggestions on what we should try. We started with the arancini as our appetizer which was a great option. I then ordered the lasagna and my boyfriend ordered the lobster ravioli. Both of our dishes were delicious and the portion sizes were more then enough! Cibo wine bar is a nice restaurant with delicious food, a great ambiance, and excellent service. I will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"The mushroom risotto was very tasty. Maybe a bit salty.
The palenta was not \"meat balls\" as guest expected. I told my friend it was made of corn but he insisted they were meatballs. Anyhow, I ate more of the palenta than he did. Tasty again! Not too salty and liked the cheesy dip."}
{"text":"Customer service begins before you get seated at the table, and theirs is AWFUL. It is small wonder that their service gets such poor reviews online.

They offered a buytopia voucher for their Sunday brunch with bubbles, which I bought.  The deadline is Nov. 30th. For the entire month and then some, the online reservations are full up for Sunday.  I tried calling them. At most I got an answering machine, which never returns messages.

So against my better judgment I lined up on Sunday morning and was 5th in line when they opened at 11:30am.  There were perhaps 10 people behind me.  I explained to the hostess that I could not get a reservation online, but as I was alone, I would be willing to eat at the bar area.

She curtly said that they were sold out for brunch that day and next week (the last possible date before expiry).  So I asked her what was I do. She said I could use the original amount paid at face value at any time.

NO WAY!  I am not giving this snobby, customer-unfriendly, over-rated wine bar one penny of my business.  I have been here for dinner, and it's nothing special. There are a HUNDRED better Italian places in Toronto - they should get a reality check.

If they don't want voucher business, they shouldn't issue vouchers.  Period.  Meanwhile I'm out cab fare and travel time.  Next time I'll stick to Little Italy."}
{"text":"A great experience. I went there for my birthday and I was pleased. The ambiance is great excellent place to take date. The servers were quick. The food was delicious. I enjoyed the pizza. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and wonderful services. Be sure to go with a bigger party in order to enjoy the variety of its delicious dishes. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love this place. Chic ambiance makes it date worthy. Also good for a nice dinner out with friends. Yes, polenta fries are fun to look at and tasty. The only reason this place doesn't get 5 starts is because service is a hit or miss but overall decent for a restaurant in this area. It feels classy, modern, and upscale but not too snooty."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my night out at Cibo with friends. This restaurant is surprisingly big, and always packed. The waitress are very hot and friendly, which got me thinking that they are probably graduates from Hooters. Thus, great place to have a nice diner and drinks with friends."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars

I was invited to Cibo Yorkville's preview dinner. The location is great and the space is beautiful. I thought that the service was wonderful and overall I had a good experience.

I think all the tables got random menu items to sample. We started with a beautiful charcuterie board with a nice selection of meats and cheeses. My friend and I both enjoyed it a lot.

For mains, we were given a roasted chicken and an artichoke pizza to sample. The roasted chicken was well cooked, even though it looked almost a little undercooked around the leg. Could be a tad more flavourful... But we both enjoyed the veggies and potatoes on the side.

As for the pizza, my friend found a piece of hair in her slice, so that sort of ruined it for both of us.

For dessert, we were served a delicious tiramisu- the portion size was very generous. We were very pleased.

One complaint I did have is that the drinks were very watered down (I had a mojito and a sangria). But I'm not sure if it's because this is just a preview dinner. This is one area that I think they can improve.

On the whole, they have some kinks to work out, but we had a pleasant experience and would return to try again."}
{"text":"Yesterday was the second time we've been to Cibo and we were pleased. The food is honest and for the price, well pointed.
I believe it is a great choice for those who doesn't want to spend a lot, but is looking for a trendy ambience at King West. 
The fried polenta is delicious and my husband liked the mushroom risotto."}
{"text":"The ambiance of CIBO on Yonge is absolutely delightful. I'd describe the decor as somewhat of a mix of industrial and hipster.  We were definitely impressed! 

We had a reservation for 7:45 but got there around 7:15 and to our pleasant surprise they were able to seat us. 

We ordered the deep friend calamari rings to start,  YUM! For a deep friend dish it was surprisingly light.  To start you're served bread with Rosemary and sea salt, to be eaten with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. It was so good we got 3 orders to split between the 5 of us.  

For my 3 course winterlicious meal I chose the polenta fries, lobster ravioli and lemon gelato.  YUM,  eh and YUM respectively.  Me and my friend ordered the lobster ravioli and we were disappointed by the slightly fishy taste,  as if the lobster came from a can. But Kudos to the polenta fries and lemon gelato, it was exactly what I expected to be and more.  

I hate to end on a negative note but our waitress was inattentive and unprofessional. Our table had to waive her down to let her know that we ready to order, to have our water topped off and to grab our bill. In fact we had to waive her down multiple times just to grab her attention, and in those times she gave a dismissive wave and dirty look as if we were being intrusive to her when asking for the bill (we waited 20-25 mins for our bill since we first waived her down). Once we finally got our bill she took another 10 mins to even bring the machine! We were extremely disappointed with the service that we received. Due to this reason it would be unlikely that me and my group of friends return to this particular location."}
{"text":"Just adding to other reviews here really. Food is okay, not great, not terrible. Have eaten here numerous times as close and convenient. Stick to the pizzas and can't really go wrong. Service is hit and miss. I've had some great, cheerful and helpfull servers, while other times the service has been fairly poor....like they don't really want to be there. Overall, though, service pretty good. The hostess, however, is one of the rudest people I have ever met and should not be in the hospitality industry! It is usually the same girl and is always consistent in her rudeness! Have usually enjoyed my experience there but know what to expect now!"}
{"text":"Had great food and drink. Ordered the short rid and steak they were great. Love this place."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant and bar on king west by far. 
The food and service are 10-10. Our favourite chef is Ahmed and he always takes care of us outstandingly!
No matter if you are coming as a couple or a group, you will be very impressed with all the food and the service.
The portions are a very good size and they don't cheap out on the anti pasti - like buca does.
The bar area is perfect for drinks and apps. I would totally recommend this restaurant to anyone and would say it's one of the best in the city!"}
{"text":"LOVE the atmosphere in this place! Went here with my husband a couple of weeks ago - food and service were both great. There was a downstairs and a loft section upstairs. We went here on a Friday night and the place was busy all evening."}
{"text":"On our visit to Toronto, we decided to stop in to grab a bite to eat.  We were enticed by the smells as we passed by and decided to give it a try.  

Sadly, it was poor decision that we regretted dreadfully.  

The receptionist told us that it would be 1 hr before a table would open and gave us the option to sit at the bar.  We took the option unknowingly what awaited us. 

Once seated, my girlfriend and I ordered 2 drinks- both which were prepared overly sweet and unsatisfying.   

We ordered our meals- a margherita pizza for the table to share, 2 orders of pasta, another pizza , and a salad with a side of beef skewers.  

It took almost 20 minutes for the 1st pizza to come out of the oven to the table which was borderline burnt leaving a odd metallic taste in your mouth.  

As we observed other tables being seated after us receiving their food before us, the irritation and dissatisfaction grew.  

Almost 1 solid FUCKIN hour til our food hit the table while others received their food 20 minutes sooner. - the table that was beside us was a party of 9 and they got their food even before us, which too me is a bloody fuckin insult.

The food that DID arrive at the table (the 2nd pizza was missing and did not arrive for another 15 minutes), was sub par at best.  The pasta that was ordered was over cooked and never near al dente.  The overall appearance and texture was dry and left an unpleasant mouth feel as the cheese was not melted as the overall dish was cold.  

The salad was over dressed with olive oil and nothing else leaving a greasy flavor on your palate.  

We were highly upset at the service of this establishment as they ALL seemed not to care about customer satisfaction.  HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FAUX ITALIAN RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"I can't give any restaurant a five star as I have nothing to compare it to but definately a 4+.  Very surprised to find an unpretentious menu in such an upscale spot.  It was raining and we had resigned ourselves to Whole Foods takeout but fortunately for us WF closed before we got there and we walked across the street to Cibo.  GREAT choice.  We had the tomato salad, spaghetti with meat balls, and a pizza.  A previous review was correct, full size pizza we could have shared but I loved the non Prego sauce. I expected large, tough, meat balls but received a  bunch of little, gentle meat balls.  A dish easy to ruin, I have done it often, but Cibo's was perfect.  I had to ask for a soup spoon to twirl the spaghetti, the way I was taught, but I guess people don't learn that way now days.  We will be here another week and I hope we get  back to Cibo."}
{"text":"King West - nice Italian and seafood.

One of the best options on among west for the wine list alone.  The menus options are very nice.  Trendy location with a trendy crowd."}
{"text":"Bad service, only brought one set of silverware even though there were two of us.  I asked three times.  Did not bring bread, said they were making it.  Hot day, drink empty, waitress disappeared for entire time.  Asked for manager, i was told they were not there.  I told the waitress that she gave bad service, she didn't care.  I have not given a zero tip in ten years until today.  This place desperately needs a manager."}
{"text":"What a fantastic restaurant in Yorkville! I have been here at least three times in the past few months. Tried the Gnocci, the Calzone, some rice ball dish with cheese (forgot its name, but it was fantastic!). If you are looking for a fancy Italian place that tastes amazing, Cibo is it. 

Just wish they would serve us more of the bread, everyone at our table vaccummed it!"}
{"text":"I'm very surprised that Cibo has such a low rating. The place has a fantastic ambiance, the service we got was great, and watching the girl swing around to retrieve bottles of wine was a unique experience!

I wasn't particularly hungry, so I ordered a board and shared the Tiramisu, both of which were presented beautifully. The bread, olives and peppers that they bring out before the meal were also a highlight (particularly the peppers!!)"}
{"text":"After a fantastic experience at the Yonge & Eglinton location for dinner, we came to this location for the Groupon Brunch special which included two buffets and mimosas.  I am not a huge brunch person, so the idea of a pizza and charcuterie and cheese was SUPER appealing and the selection did not disappoint. I found a few of the items to be lacking in salt (the caesar & alfredo sauce come to mind) but there was no salt on the table. I probably could have asked but there were so many other delicious things to be eaten, so no biggy. The set up is a little strange, in that there is food on three separate levels of the restaurant, but it wasn't too big of a bother and probably stopped me from getting that last extra plate that I did not need."}
