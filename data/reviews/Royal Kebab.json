{"text":"I've known about this place for a while already after receiving their flyer/menu in the mail but finally tried it out for the first time last week. I tried their Kabab koobideh and it was love at first bite. The meat was succulent and exploded with flavor in my mouth. The Basmati rice was surprisingly flavorful on its own and their 'special sauce' (Tahini sauce?) is a great complement to the food.  Went back again to get takeout today and got the family combo meal. We thought price-wise it was a bit on the high side but even my boring non-culinary adventurist family, who rarely ever venture out of their comfort zone when it comes to food, loved it. They told me my recommendation did not disappoint one bit and would definitely order takeout from here again. I, on the other hand, already planned to become regular customer."}
{"text":"The food is awesome, good quality and delicious. The price is very reasonable and the portion is enough even for big eaters. Although the restaurant is very small with few tables to seat. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Food is alright. Long waits. Restaurant is marred by bad management and crude sanitation.."}
{"text":"The food is really good, but the restaurant is really no-frills.  If you just want a quick kebab fix or takeout this is a good place."}
