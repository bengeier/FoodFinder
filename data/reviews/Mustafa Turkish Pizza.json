{"text":"I've been coming to Mustafa's for years. Staff, service, and the food keep getting better. The spicy beef pide was excellent, maybe ask for it to be a bit spicier for people who are able to handle a lot of spice. The ambiance is unique, and the prices are reasonable. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I really love their foods whenever I go Mustafa Turkish Pizza I feel like I'm in Turkey. The atmosphere is friendly and the service is excellent! I highly recommend Mustafa Turkish Pizza to everyone who loves Turkish foods."}
{"text":"We came here last year and the Doner was amazing. We came back today at about 5:30pm and after being seated, were told the Doner was \"finished\" and they would not have more until next week. French fries? Also finished. Only pide (pizza). The pide was fine, but the service was terrible. We had to ask several times for our drinks. They apparently only have the other items on their menu besides pizza on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and then only until it's \"finished\"."}
{"text":"Fantastic Turkish food.  I have dined here 3 times and have consistently received great service and delicious food. We order the pides and kebobs.   Pros:  -Authentic Turkish cuisine -Fast and friendly service -Fresh and delicious food every time -Rather generous portions  Cons:  -The incredibly strange decor. I know some people like it, but to me it was visually offensive. Don't bring a 1st date here if you're trying to impress them with ambiance!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent friendly service, very clean place! I always come here for Turkish food!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent.  Delicious and fresh food with great desserts.  The interior looks very nice as well.  Would gladly come back as the prices are reasonable and the service is great.    Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ordered #2 Etli Ekmek. Advertised as ground beef pizza but I'm quite sure it wasn't. The server mentioned that it was 10% lamb but it tasted more \"gamey\" than that. Service was also very slow and poor. We asked for water and didn't receive any until we asked two more times. By the time the water arrived, it was only 2 cups for our group of 6 and we were finished our meals. Some things I appreciated: The portions were generous.  The free salad was fresh. Also, the prices seem to include tax (and gratuity?).  I paid with my credit card but wasn't given an option to add a tip."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great customer service, unique and mellow ambience, and delicious Turkish food! The staff are very welcoming and the architecture of this place is so cool; its interior is cave-like. I can't think of other adjectives to describe this place. Anyway, I've been here several times with friends, and it's always a delight to grub here. Their portions are VERY generous. The prices are very reasonable (ranging from $12-$20). You get what you pay for and then some. You always get a salad when you order a plate, and it's not some crappy salad. It has feta cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers, bell pepper, and a mix of greens. I always order the same pide (Turkish pizza), but I forgot the name/number of it. It has spinach and feta, and it's so yummy! In addition, this place doesn't charge tax which struck me as surprised when I first ate here. I highly recommend this place, for sure!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place late one night. It's got mouth watering dishes and cool ambience. Rustic wooden benches and cave like ceiling and walls. Great food! If u want Turkish food come here!"}
{"text":"My 1st Restaurant visit in Toronto, but i did not come out really good. Firstly  me and my friend had to wait for 1 hour to get the ordered food even though it was not rush hour.  Secondly the food taste was terrible and price was more... It was not a really a good experience.  Only ambiance was good.."}
{"text":"From the outside this place doesn't look like much.  I have passed by a million times and didn't think much of it.  A friend of mine took me there and I was really pleasantly surprised.  Inside the restaurant is like being in a cave complete with stalagmites and everything.  The staff were really friendly and  the food was delicious.  We came late on a Sunday and the only food left for the day was Turkish pizzas.  There were four of us and we ordered 3 pizzas which was more then enough food for all of us.  Each of us received a fresh salad to start which was lightly dressed and tasted delicious.  Loved the vibe of this place and enjoyed the food.  The decor was fabulous with the cave details and the amazing wood furniture.  Would recommend and return."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! If you're in a group order one less than the number of people and share. The quantities are large. It's not single pizza sizes or prizes. It was $18 for a pizza with tax and tip."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and it is hands down, the best Turkish restaurant in the city. They seem to be known for their delicious pides (Turkish style Pizza) which you can get vegetarian or with ground beef or beef sausage (no pork served). If you can't decide on which pizza to order, there an option to have all of their popular ones together in one pide. Yum!  For any meat lovers however, the star of the place is the Iskander.   This beauty consists of a generous portion of thinly sliced beef topped with a tomato sauce on a bed of bread and yogurt. This is melt in your mouth savory goodness that dreams are made of. Truly and honestly, you can't get better than this.   The servers are incredibly nice despite knowing very little English. The place is kept clean and their attention to detail is great.   The restaurant is charming and really unique with its cave like decor and rustic wooden tables.   To top it all off, they give you a delicious complimentary salad with every meal.   Please try this place! You won't be dissappointed!"}
{"text":"One word to describe this place - Amazing! my fiance and I were visiting a nearby store and were just about to leave, when we got a waft  of the delicious food smell. So we decided to check it out.   As soon as we walked in, we were pleasantly surprised. The place is made to look like the inside of the cave and looked really  cool. And the staff were reallly friendly. As soon as we sat down, we were greeted with water and bowl of complimentary salad. I'm usually not a big fan of salad; but this one was really good.   The place specializes in Turkish pizza. We got the one with lamb and beef, as well as the beef kebab. When the food came out, it was hot and fresh and tasted mouth wateringly delicious; so much so, that my fiance and I barely conversed during the time that we spent eating the food.   We then tried out their baklava and that too tasted delicious! Everything about this place was awesome. I will definitely be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for years and telling every one we know for years . amazing food and service . we drive from markham .love the food there"}
{"text":"We like the food but we do not like the wait time. Be prepared to wait for 30 minutes to 1 hour to get a table. Its very busy. They dont take reservation."}
{"text":"The best Shawarma in Ontario. affordable prices, clean, friendly and delicious."}
{"text":"I just had a pile of stuff and it was delicious!  And we had something which was basically a pizza and it was delicious!  And we had sour cherry nectar and it was...you got it, delicious!"}
{"text":"I wanted to see what the hype was about so I finally made my way there with a friend on a Tuesday late afternoon. From reading reviews, I made sure to go at a time that's not busy and I did not have to wait for a table. I knew what to expect in terms of the whole cave setting so on to the food.   The only menu options that day were the pizzas or the doner plate. I opted for the beef doner plate. The price on the menu for the plate with rice was $20 so that struck me as high priced and I was very skeptical at that point. Since the rice, doner and salad are pretty much prepared/cooked throughout the day, the food came within a few minutes of being ordered. The rice was bland, the salad was ok, the bread was ok, but to my complete surprise, the portion of beef was substantial. Most restaurants, never mind just Turkish or middle eastern ones, are stingy with the meat portions. This portion is at least 2-4x what you would get at other places. So while $20 is more than the $10-$15 at a comparative establishment, it is justified. The quality of the beef is decent and when my plate was finished, I was full. This is what makes or breaks a place for me. Mustafa made it.  I am rarely in this area so it is not a place I would visit regularly or travel to  specially during busy hours. I advise others not to go out of their way or wait a long time to come here but if you are in the area and it's not busy it's a good choice."}
{"text":"If you want to try Turkish pizza , Iskender or dessert, this is the place. The interior of this restaurant is designed to look ,somehow,  like a cave in Turkey. The large wooden benches and tables are made of real tree trunks. Note ; Iskender ( look like shawarma or  Greek gyros) available only on the weekends. No Turkish Tea served on the weekends. Because, they said they are busy . Desserts: Kunefe was very fresh, crispy and not too sweet. lots pistachio. Food : The Iskender with rice ( comes with some thin flat Naan and chilli pickle) $ 17 (only  on weekends). Service ; They are very busy but very polite and nice people and serve you ASAP for dine in.                 They recommend to share the table with others for faster service( if you are  two people ) Salad : the complementary green salad was also good Pizza : it was different style but Yummy. Drink : Yogurt drink \" Ayran was my favourite.."}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing food, the iskender was fantastic! Only thing I wish they had were more diet drinks. But I can live without them :)."}
{"text":"I had an absolutely outstanding experience yesterday at Mustafa Turkish Pizza.  My girlfriend and I stumbled upon this place on Yelp and decided we want to try it. It was our first time there and we weren't sure what to order. When we told the server that we hadn't been here before, he became extra accommodating. He suggested two popular turkish pizzas - which were both outstanding - and gave us complimentary tea and desert on the house.    Everything about this experience was great. The food, the service, the atmosphere. It is a must-try!"}
{"text":"Decoration was something unique. I like their pide (no#5 and 18) eskandar kabab and kunefe (specially kunefe was very good). Complementary salad was very delicious"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night - the front door was blocked off and everyone was lined up in the back to get one of the very limited tables or for takeout. It was a rather messy situation where the back door entrance to the kitchen was used for everyone to get into the restaurant. There was no formal system to order the food - nobody was really there to take our order. It was actually a rather extremely unsanitary situation given all the customers had to walk through the kitchen. I hope that it was a one-time situation, but no explanation was really provided.  Having said that, the food itself was great. We ordered #18 Karisik ($16 before tax) which was sort of like a sampler of 4 kinds of toppings that came with a salad. We shared it between 2 people and didn't realize it was more of a personal pizza size. The crust was flavourful and soft and toppings were really good. I'd definitely consider coming back... but hope the situation with seating/takeout was just a one-time ordeal."}
{"text":"This really should be a 3.5 star because I really wanted to love the place and I don't want to be the one to tarnish it's reviews! Gotta support the small business owners... They're really trying!   The good: Great unique ambiance like everyone says... Cave rock ceilings and solid rustic wooden tables. The place feels very legitimately clean and well kept. Loved the refreshing simple green salad that comes complimentary.   However the food itself really didn't wow me, even though there's nothing to complain about. Maybe I'm just not a fan of Turkish seasoning? I love Afghan spices so I thought it only natural for me to like Turkish too! Anyhow we ordered the beef kebab which had very unexciting flavour... Really needs more spices and maybe a sauce. Dare I say it was bordering bland (as I've read in others' reviews) but I wouldn't go that far. Then beef and cheese pizza was good... But still nothing to write home about or warrant a rave review.   Just didn't love it but I do wish them well!"}
{"text":"After seeing the pictures, I took my coworkers to this location for lunch. As soon as we got their, we were seated and let me tell you the place is decorated very nicely and it just adds goodness to the dinning in experience.  Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu as this was out first time trying out a Turkish Pizza. Excitement was in the air and I went on ordering Karisik, which was an assorted pizza of their most popular flavours, giving me a sample of each. There was slices of feta, lamb, Turkish sausage, chicken, and ground beef. The ground beef was my favourite one from all. The meal came with a fresh salad and an imported Turkish pops.   Overall, We all enjoyed our experience.  For my Muslim Folks- They serve halal meat at this location."}
{"text":"I like that the serving is really really generous. Place is designed like a cave inside,really cozy too. Staff are warm. My taste buds weren't as satisfied though. I find it too tasty. Things are either too salty or too spicy. But that isn't their fault. That's just probably they are made. I really love one of their beef dish. I'll definitely come back for that. 3.5 out of 5 star."}
{"text":"I love the decor here! I would come here just for the cool Fraggle Rock interior. The menu is basically pizza or shawarma platters. I enjoyed the pide (pizza) a lot and the salad was good too. You would never guess from the outside how neat this restaurant looks."}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall is a local gem. They have extensive pide options that are all excellent and so delicious. Their desserts are so fresh and taste amazing, definitely 10/10.   The parking at this place is horrid and would not trust your car parked anywhere close to the entrance. All in all a great place with great food."}
{"text":"Mustafa Turkish Pizza transported me to Turkey.  My friend and I wanted a late-night bite, and I'm so glad this was our choice. The atmosphere is unlike any other, the food selection is vast, and the service is great too.  Of course I saved the best part for last... The food. The pizza is mouthwatering  and delicious. Every single bite you take is a piece of heaven, and you even get a lovely salad before your main course. The combinations of meat and cheese is well-thought out.  Did I mention the baklava? It is SO rich and delectable. You'll want to have 10 but know that you can't... Unless you really want to.  I hope Mustafa is here for years to come! Thank you for the amazing experience."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food is great, the issue is that it has gotten so popular the restaurant can't handle it so customers are \"getting a bad experience\". The waiting area is tiny and the wait is long, expect it especially on a busy times.   They really need to move to a bigger location and redo their decor. The tables and booths are nice but the walls are making the area seem even smaller than it really is.   Those who cannot wait, i say do a takeout or go during less busy hours."}
{"text":"Amazing Turkish pizza. (pide) Delicious and amazing price with salad to boot! Only $10"}
{"text":"Upon arrival we were greeted and seated promptly, but throughout the visit I felt as if we were neglected, even though it wasn't even busy - 2 other guests in the whole space! Quite tragic if you ask me. I assumed the guy who sat us was new, but that doesn't excuse simple common server knowledge like taking our food away, fetching our waters we had to ask twice for because after waiting 15 minutes it never came, or even checking us to see if we wanted our bill. I don't believe they deserved much tip that day and was hoping for a better experience because of all the other raving reviews. I really wanted to like this place but my experience was too disappointing. Overall, the pizza was just okay and nothing really stood out to me about it. This place actually doesn't even serve tap water or filtered. Only bottled, so be prepared to pay a higher price for something you should be getting for free. Honestly I've tried better pizza, had better service and this place was a flop."}
{"text":"This place was spotless on a Sunday afternoon. Nice Dekor. Restaurnt smelled really good. Food looked very good but I was missing flavour. Waited 1 hour for my food which was fine but I expected more taste."}
{"text":"Dropped in spontaneously for lunch and it was such a good idea! Such great service, and good food. I've never had Turkish pizza before but I'm a big fan because it had a really thin crispy crust, and light but flavourful toppings. I recommend the Lahmacun Turkish pizza."}
{"text":"My introduction to Pide is attributed to my Turkish friends who introduced me to this concoction of bread, cheese and meat. I would say the mainstream deep crust pizza is a close reference point. The place they took me to was run by the chef who runs this place now. Since I had never been Turkey I use that spot as a benchmark for good pide which according to my friends could compete with the good one served in Turkey.  However the experience started to falter and that place went down a bit  after a few years of solid performance. Still decent but not the great pide I had the first few year there. Chef Mustafa moved to another spot for a bit that I also tried but somehow it didn't have the wow factor and it was a lot less accessible. I tried a few other spots that had opened up but they never reached the same level. I am however pleased to share this place reaches almost 80% of what my first experience was of Pide. The menu is like the other spots i.e. simple with picture and some description and some kebabs as well. I went for the assorted version as wanted to sample everything on the menu.  I was surprised to get a mid sized salad which is included with the mains. This salad is typical of what I have seen at Turkish dinners. Feta, greens, Tomato, onions with a light oil dressing. Decent I would say.  Now for the main event the Pide is served piping hot so keep an eye on that. The beef and chicken topping slices were ok but spiced down a bit. The main attraction IMO of Bastrama and Sujuck didn't hold back as much thankfully. The dough was better than what I have tried at other spots. A very decent Pide I would say better than other iterations in the city.   The interior is a bit odd as apparently they are going for a Cappadocia look.  A Solid 3.5 stars. I will be back to try the lahmahchun on my next visit and perhaps even a kebab or two."}
{"text":"Had the kebab and the lamb/beef pide.   The kebab was extremely good. Very generous portions of lamb, and it was really tasty. Great value at $10.   The pide was okay. I've had  better pide's at Turkish places overseas (but this is my first pide in Toronto). The meat was a little too spicy, and a bit chewy. It didn't taste as good as the meat in the kebab.   If the pide was better, this place would be an easy 5 stars. Still giving it 4 because the kebab was so good... will definitely return for that.   Place looks very \"interesting\" inside Take credit card/ parking lot at front for a few cars"}
{"text":"A very decent option for authentic Turkish food. They also bring you complementary salads. The taste however can be a bit on the blend side and the menu a bit limited (similar items). The portions are also large, with decent greasiness!"}
{"text":"I would actually give this place about 3.75 Stars, which I rounded up to 4.   It was very solid, freshly made, and with great ingredients, but my main critique was that the overall effect was, for me, a very lightly-topped, under-sauced, under-flavored Pizza, but well made from really good ingredients.  I had the assorted Pide, and it was quite good, but just not quite up to all of the rave reviews that I suppose had set my expectations very high.  The decor is very funky and over the top, with it's slightly claustrophobic cave theme and slab wood furniture, but fun.  So, to summarize, if I'm comparing this to Pizza Pizza, there's absolutely no contest, and this place completely blows them away. But if I'm comparing Mustafa to my FAVORITE pizza places, it would be in the second-tier of \"fall back joints\", that I would visit only if the places I like best were unavailable.  My impression was also that the serving-size-to-price ratio was a little bit high based on a typical pizza joint, as the unique football shape fold reduces the overall surface area and therefore quantity of toppings when compared to a round Pizza, but despite these minor quibbles, I actually enjoyed it, so 4 stars it is."}
{"text":"Stick to the pastry's its great, the problem is when it's crowded chaos all over so u won't feel comfortable eating."}
{"text":"My Turkish hubby was craving some lahmacun and we were in the area so we came to Mustafa. We've eaten here a few times before and it's always been good.  The lahmacun is enormous and we always end up taking some home. I got pide with sucuk and cheese and I asked for feta as well. It was delicious. My hubby got chicken shish, and of course, if tried some too. The chicken was SO good. The flavour was fantastic and the meat was cooked perfectly. If I wasn't so full of pide I would have stolen more chicken from his plate.   Before the main meals came they brought us both a small salad. I like the salad here better than some other Turkish restaurants because of the dressing. It's typical oil and lemon but i think they add a little vinegar too. I love it.  We were too full this time to get künefe for dessert, but we've had it before and I'd definitely recommend it.  The decor inside Mustafa leaves an impression too. The cave like walls and ceiling, and creeping plants everywhere create a cool atmosphere. My fave is the tables and benches. They are made from giant pieces of natural wood and every tables is different."}
{"text":"Mustafa is a somewhat out of the way joint in the northern part of the city that is absolutely worth the trek!  They have a limited menu but what they do serve is top notch! Their true specialty is Donair meat which they only serve on Fridays/Weekends! You may think that their $18/$20 dishes are a bit pricey but you'll find a HUGE platter of Donair sitting in front of you drippy with mouth watering juices and flavor! When the Donair is available, you'll generally be waiting in a lineup to get a table. The locals and others who've come from around the city know why this place is the best Donair place in Toronto!  They have even set up the place to look like the inside of a cave which I've been told is a fairly standard style for the Cappadocian region in Turkey.  They also serve Pide's which are pretty good but not as outstandingly amazing as their Donair platter or Iskandar platter! If you are a meat lover, you must make a point of coming here!"}
{"text":"Would I come back? Yes.   This is what we ordered: -- Kavurmali Kasarli - lamb and mozzarella panini -- Mevlana - pizza with feta & mozzarella cheese mixed with parsley melted over mildly spiced ground beef, mixed with tomatoes, parsley, peppers and onions -- Kunefe - dessert with shredded pastry, cheese, and syrup  Everything was delicious. The bread in the lamb and mozza dish smelled and tasted so good, and the mevlana was delicious too. I hate parsley, but you can't taste it at all. The kunefe is a must-try; it was everything I'd hoped it would be: crispy and sweet.  My only concerns were the freshness of the mevlana and the taste of the lamb. The mevlana's freshness was questionable because I asked for it without parsley and they said that wasn't an option. I'm not sure if that means it's pre-made, but while it was delicious, it did have the appearance of reheated pizza where the toppings kind of mesh together in a flat, quick-drying, hardened way. The lamb in the kavurmali kasarli had that kinda strange shredded meat taste, which wasn't entirely off-putting, but it did take a little getting used to.   All in all, I would definitely come back because of the overall taste of the food. Even with my concerns above, I mostly care about taste at the end of the day and everything was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!!! They have the best Turkish food ever!!! You must try the iskender, which is a bed of freshly made flat bread with doner meat on top and amazing tomato sauce poured over with yogurt on the side. Its just so good! Of course, another great item is #1 off the menu which is lahmacun, flat crust with minced beef on top, make sure you squeeze some lemon on it before eating to add some kick to it, its the traditional way of eating lahmacun. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The tastiest food you will ever have in the GTA!!!!! The döner is amazing it tastes the same to me as it does in Turkey! All of the pides are the same size and they're very big portions of its your first time you should try #18 its assorted. Their drink menus has gazoz which is awesome tastes like sprite but it's fruity. All of his baklava/sweets are delicious there's a very generous amount of pistachios in all of the sweets. The washrooms were very clean also!"}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem in the area. This place specializes in Turkish \"pizzas\". They have about 20 varieties of pizzas that will throw you off your feet! I have tried the mildly spiced minced beef (#2) and assorted topping (#18) pizzas. The minced beef pizza was on the lighter side. The assorted pizza gives you a little bit of all their most popular toppings, from chicken to cheese.   We also tried the plain shawarma, which came with thin pita breads. The pita was nice and crispy, while the thinly slices meat still captured the original juices despite being cooked in heat.  There are some interesting beverages available. The white yogurt drink is actually quite salty. It was different, but I definitely preferred the orange (bottle) soda better. It is like a less sweet version of fanta. As well, they have a selection of apricot, cherry and peach sodas from Turkey. They also serve Turkish tea by the cup.  Finally, definitely try their pistachio baklava-like dessert. The friendly server told me the name, but I forgot. There is a crispy and soft version. Both will be topped with a generous spoonful of pistachio crumbs. I recommend having a cup of tea, where the tea would help balance out the sweetness of the pastry!"}
{"text":"I keep on coming to this place. is awesome. nice deco, recently new wooden tables chairs. really nice concept.  Price is right everything is about $10-$14 huge portions.  service is good nice people. great family restaurant. recommend it 100%"}
{"text":"This place is not exactly on a very busy and easily accessible street but the food is worth the trip. There are about 16 Turkish pizzas to choose from and 4 of them are vegetarian.  The desert is a separate story - it's delicious and has to be tried. One try is worth a million words.  The decoration of the restaurant inside is very unique. It feels like you're inside a cave with tables made of solid pieces of wood."}
{"text":"Lemme tell you this: the food is tasty with great aroma, Portions are huge with reasonable prices, Very beautiful decor. The only middle eastern place that serves real spicy/hot food upon request.  This place is a great bang for your buck. Give it a try and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Probably the best Turkish meat you'll find in Toronto. The restaurant is designed after a Turkish cave town Kapidokia.  The Lehamacen is amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Desserts were good too. Ingredients are really fresh. I thought the service was great too."}
{"text":"Recently took a couple of my friends to this place. They thought turkish food was just like any other middle-eastern cuisine. To their surprise, this place was heaven to them. Ambience is amazing with the cave like theme with rock ceiling. Foreign juices and pops. and the small menu but with enough choices to have you scratching your head. Decided to get the mixed pide. Amazing. however the highlight of the night was the iskander. Turkish shawarma with a doughy bottom and cheese and yougurt. Amazing. Loved it. 3 people ...total was $41. Need i say more."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying turkish pizza. This place is close to Yorkdale Mall.  This place has a neat interior, cave-like structure that gives off a great atmosphere.   We ordered the assorted pizza and the turkish sausage. It comes with complimentary salad. We really enjoyed the assorted pizza where we tasted a little bit of everything. There was slices of feta, lamb, turkish sausage, chicken, and ground beef. The lamb slice was our favourite! The crust was interesting, thin and crispy, kind of like a toasted pita texture.  We also tried their yoghurt drink and the taste we are not accustomed to. It's more on the sourish taste instead of the sweet taste we were use to.  Overall, this was a great experience. The interior gives off a nice atmosphere and the food was yummy!"}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday and it was packed. NOTE: They only serve Iskander from Fri-Sun. So it's very packed on weekends. We didn't want to wait an hour so we came back on a Monday to try their Pide and beef kebab.   I thought the beef kebab was just ok. It's basically tenderloin beef chunks with a light tomato based sauce with rice, some veggies, and a salad. But for $20 I would be just as happy to order a similar beef steak/tenderloin kebob from other middle eastern places for around $14-16.  Now the Pide (and Iskander) seems to be what people are raving about, and rightly so. The Pide is noticeably more pricey than Mr Pide's, starting at $12 and go to $16. Compared with Mr Pides which is around $10 each. However, this is a situation of you getting what you paid for. Mustafa's Pide is loaded with stuff. We ordered the lamb & mozzarella and also a ground beef Pide. Both are stuffed with tons of meat. And of course, they tastes fantastic. The dough is cooked just right and the meat are delicious. I'm no Pide expert but I'd say the meat to dough ratio is perfect!  So I would definitely come here for their Pide and Iskander. While I don't find their kebob dishes special, they are definitely delicious too."}
{"text":"Great food at a hidden spot. Order four kinds of pizza and share. The Turkish coffee is very authentic and good."}
{"text":"I've never had Turkish food before but I tried Mustafa because of their Yelp reviews. OMG their chicken kebab is the best I've ever had! Who would think a kebab could be so good? It was so juicy and flavourful that I kept eating even though I was super stuffed. My girlfriend and I ordered a few things to share and couldn't move after we finished. Everything was so delicious, we couldn't stop eating. We ordered one of their pizzas too. Again, so good. They also give you salad, yogurt, sides of red onion with some kind of seasoning and some other kind of side which I couldn't figure out but ate it anyway. You definitely won't be hungry when you leave here. Their portions are big but not too big.  Mustafa was so good that I went back a week later and brought my kids. They love trying new cuisines and loved Mustafa as well. We went on a weekend and had iskender. Never had it before but will order again. Their chicken kebabs though, I've had dreams about them. A-MAZING!"}
{"text":"Mustafa has real Turkish food. Never changed the quality. My favorite Turkish Restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Amazing food . great service. I will let every one i know about this place .very busy on the weekend so give your self extra time ."}
{"text":"I work very close to this location.  The Turkish pizza is very good. I think just about everything is $10.  Great spot for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Being half-Turkish myself, it has always been a struggle to find a restaurant that serves classic Turkish dishes comparable to the quality I am used to at home. Mustafa's goes above and beyond expectations, providing patrons with friendly and speedy service, as well as delicious food. Every dish comes with free side salad, the decore is that of a cozy rustic cave, and the entire restaurant exudes passion . 10 10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant! Very busy on Saturdays. I had to wait 15 minutes for a vacant table. Very nice and patient servers, I think they need more because of the amount of people that come by.   I tried the lamb and pastrami Turkish pizzas. The lamb and cheese didn't have enough flavour but my friend says it's his favourite at Mustafa. The pastrami and cheese was waaaay too salty, and I eat a lot of salt. Won't be ordering it again but I would definitely come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and really like it. The waiter is very sweet. The food is good. The décor is \" interesting\" lol.  It's just a little hidden gem with good Turkish food. Can't wait to go back. Very busy on weekends when they have the donair (the big turning meat rotating on a skewer) I went on a Saturday at around 1pm and you should have seen the size of that meat! and they say that it is sold out by early evening so that gives you an idea of how busy it gets. You can't go wrong with pide or lahmajoon with salad for $10. The desert (can't remember the name but they bake it and it is warm) is soo good."}
{"text":"Came in around lunch time, wasn't greeted. Decided to sit myself down after waiting 5 mins. After 10 mins waitress said hello without bringing menus. Place was not busy, but 3 people waiting for take out. After 15 mins of waiting, an employee asked me to sit at a smaller table, which is fine. But mention it at the start and bring menus. I left"}
{"text":"Overall: I am shocked that customers actually give this place anything above 2 stars. I ate at this restaurant yesterday and it was probably the worst dining experience hands down.   My family and I went to Mustafa Turkish Pizza last night for dinner. When we walked in, we saw a huge group of customers waiting to be seated. That's no problem. However, the waiting area is smack in the middle of the restaurant, amongst all the dining tables with clients seated. We were literally within a feet of some of these tables. I felt so bad for some of the customers as they could not have a private dining experience because the restaurant was so crowded, with hungry customers gauging their food.  Decor: The decor of the place is atrocious, and not to mention, extremely suffocating. The ceilings are very low, the walls look strange, and the entire ambiance is creepy.   Service: Non-existent. After we were seated, we received 4 salads right away. But, oddly enough, no one came by to ask for a drink order nor our actual food order! After 15 minutes of waiting, we had to wave down a server to take our order, who was very unprofessional. We asked her to bring utensils and she forgot (probably because she was too busy entertaining useless conversations with the table next to us instead of doing her job).  Every time we needed something, we had to basically go up to the cash and ask for it ourselves because we knew the server would not get it for us. Absolutely horrible.  Food:  I thought maybe the food would make up for the bad service and ambiance, but I was wrong. We got a flatbread with lamb and beef, and a Iskander. The flatbread (around $15) was mediocre. The Iskander ($20) was unimpressive-extremely dry and tasteless.   My recommendation is do not eat here. I am sure there are MANY better restaurants out there. The food is DEFINITELY NOT worth the price. I will probably never return."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem.The food was so good and interior design is really interesting. Service was very good and the place is very clean. I really recommend it."}
{"text":"Wow, we drove 30 mins completely out of our way from downtown just to try this place and it was well worth it!!!  The pizzas were delicious, rich but not greasy, flavorful but not salty, and the portions were generous.  All of the staff were very friendly and passionate about making sure that the guests were happy.  Our server guided us through the menu and helped us pick out their best dishes.  Even the complementary salad was delicious and fresh.  The chef/owner even came out to our table to ask us how we were doing and we could tell that he genuinely cared about our experience and was passionate about his food.  I wish this place would've been closer to Roncy where we were staying so we could've gone again but I'm glad I tried it at least once!  I wish I could go back for more!"}
{"text":"YUM! This has definitely become my favourite Turkish place after my first visit! The food is SO good, it comes hot, very well seasoned, and bursting with flavour. We were seated right away, but we only got lucky because someone had just left. We saw other people wait a really long time. It's a small place with about 10 tables.   The food comes in lovely brass plates. The portions are huge! None of us could finish our plates and ended up taking more than half of it home, yay for leftovers! Also, they give you complimentary salads as soon as you're seated.  The desserts were really good too, except they don't have tea which is really strange for a Turkish place....  Will absolutely come again!"}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely delicious! With such a unique interior, my mom and I had wanted to dine in, but the wait was too long so we got take out instead. We ordered 2 pizzas, the ground beef with onions and herbs, and the assorted with everything. While our order was messed up and we ended up waiting 35 minutes for our take out, the food redeemed the wait time. One pizza is definitely enough for 3 people as each pizza is massive! The pizzas were both delicious, full of flavor, and extremely filling. I would highly recommend giving this place a go!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! The restaurant is always packaged because their food is great.  Make sure you order the beef shawarma plate!! You won't regret it!  Honestly this is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to, and their beef shawarma here is my favorite, I will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Waited 1 hour for a table and another hour for food. The waitress didn't even put in our order in the end. Very negative experience."}
{"text":"Wasn't a huge fan of Mustafa's, as it was for the most part mediocre except for the decor. Starting with the positive, this place is actually really cool looking on the inside. From the street it looks like any other restaurant however the interior rises me of a spacious cave. The only other restaurant with this interesting of an design is the rain forest cafe. Getting into the negatives now the service was not very good the night I was here. Took awhile to be noticed and seated, with further delays for menus, ordering, and drinks. Some things were forgotten and had to be asked for a 2nd time. I had the Iskander which I describe as a drier thinner version of shawarma or sort of like gyro. It was a bit too dry for me and not super flavourful. Not sure I will be back but don't let that stop you from giving it a try."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. I visited Mustafa for the first time with a friend who raved about it, and rightfully so.  I had #18 on the food menu (what the item was actually called completely escapes me) and it serves as a sampler of all of the different pizza dishes Mustafa has to offer. I loved every single one. If I had to pick a favourite, it has to be the pizza with the grilled chicken. For a very reasonable price, you are going to get a VERY LARGE meal. I was absolutely famished walking into the restaurant, and I left the restaurant questioning my own ability to drive with the food coma setting in.  This place will get very busy during the lunch time on weekends, so make sure to plan accordingly. But after my first visit, I know that I'll be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Best Turkish food in town!!! have been here several times, this is the place I recommend when my friends ask me for the best Turkish restaurant in Toronto!! Nice cave decor is pretty cool, reasonably priced, iskender, doner plate is so full, can be eaten by 2 easily!!! has house salad for free, which is a big bonus!! looking forward to going there again, be aware of line ups if you go during regular meal time but it is worth it!!!"}
{"text":"My first time having Turkish food, and im glad that we made a quick decision while driving by.  I quickly read the Yelp reviews about their Iskender, which I will try the NEXT time I'm there, but I decided to have their Turkish assorted pizza.  One large pizza made on a gourmet dough divided into 5 sections: pepperoni, feta & spinach, ground beef, roast beef, and chicken....all topped off with Parsley.  Well prepared, and cooked with love.  Taste was bang on!!! the portion....bang on,.....price...$10 bang on!! I also forgot to mention they also served house a light house salad which complimented the meal.  Service was great, and helpful when it came to recommendation.....the ambience is cute! almost like a western decor with the wooden wheels hanging by the entrance ceiling, and cave like atmosphere inside...not too sure, but nonethless very interesting! i will be back for a second visit!"}
{"text":"Tried out this place with some friends over the past weekend. Overall a disappointing experience considering how highly recommended it is.   We had the Iskender kebab and the regular kebab with rice. Also tried out the assorted pizza and one of the beef pizzas. The taste of the food was decent, not the best Turkish food I've had. The best things about the food were the huge portions and the free salads. Sharing the dishes would be a good idea.   So why did I rate the restaurant only 2 stars? The service. It was bad. Really bad. First of all there's no hostess to help sort out the long queue of guests. We had to find someone to ask about the wait for a table, one of the waiters pointed to a clipboard with paper and told us to write down our name. This would be fine, except that there were 2 columns of names and they were calling guests from both columns. Not very organized. The waiters were quick with taking order, but got it wrong several times. They mistakenly gave our order to the table next to us. To top things off, they got our bills all wrong and tried to overcharge us. The bill wasn't itemized, and the numbers didn't add up. When we asked for clarification, it turns out they put our neighbor's food on our bill. Check your bill when eating here. I won't be returning and I wouldn't recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the service is good. It can get really busy (Im talking line ups that go outside) so either time it before the rush (after 6) or bring your patience.  The Iskander was mouth watering, melt in your mouth deliciousness. The yogurt adds just the right amount of creaminess to the dish.  Definitely a favourite. The pides were great, just a little on the salty side for me."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorites place in Toronto.  The Doner Kebab is just amazing and the portions are so generous.  1 order of Doner Kebab is maybe for 3.  The desserts are incredible. Nice place, simple, but really good food."}
{"text":"This was my first ever Turkish Pizza (pida) experience, so I'm no expert but MAN was it ever tasty.  When you arrive you receive a free green salad as an appetizer, which was a lovely little surprise for me.  The pida itself is awesome. We tried an assorted one where each slice is a different kind. I loved the pepperoni and cheese. So cheesy and delicious. We also tried a spinach & feta cheese pida which was pretty good too, but I think next time I'd try the veggie option that has more vegetables because I personally don't like things too spinachy.  The service is pretty hands off. You have to help yourself to the drink fridge and remind them when you need to pay.   But it looks like a cave in there, so that's pretty epic.   I'd come back with a grow of hungry friends and pig out. Fun experience."}
{"text":"Overrated! Overrated!  The food is mediocre. The service non existent. And these thieves try to overcharge you by making a \"wink\" \"wink\" mistake. Such a rat thing to do to your paying customers.  It was so obvious when we brought it to their attention. It's like she had the bill with the correct amount ready in the back. You can't even tell if the bill is wrong cause it's not itemized for that same reason. So they try to pull that off with everyone."}
{"text":"This place is my favourite Turkish restaurant to go to in the GTA.  My rating should be a 4.5, the only reason I deducted 0.5 points is that they don't have all of their menu available on all days of the week for . But the portions are huge and the price is very reasonable, the quality of the food is great and the authenticity of the kebobs are excellent."}
{"text":"Initially, the menu looks promising. I ordered take-out. The guy on the phone recommended I get assorted pizza which is a sample of all their pizzas in each slice. When I arrived to the restaurant to pick up my order - it was very busy. My pizza came with a side salad. The assorted pizza of the best selling flavours included: 1) turkish sausage, 2) chicken, 3) ground beef, 4) feta/spinich. The turkish slice was my least favourite - it had a very strong sausage taste. The chicken and feta/spinich slices were meh - didnt taste bad, didnt taste great. My favourite was the ground beef slice. This pizza was also too much for me to eat by myself. I ate this for dinner and lunch the next day. Overall, it was a nice change, something different. But it was very doughy.  Would not recommend turkish pizza to others. But would like to come back and try other dishes on the menu since it was packed with customers"}
{"text":"They don't have tab water, Turkish tea and Turkish coffee. Menu was so simple.  However, I left %25 tip just for the nice server."}
{"text":"Definitely Not the greatest Pizza place. We had to wait so long to get a table and the servers didn't know how to write names in in right order, therefore some customers got into argument as to who came first. The servers are careless and very very rude!"}
{"text":"This place is the best place I've been to in a while for food. I have never had Turkish food before this day but I seriously believe that this is one of the best places ever.  Walked in, and greeted by some lovely servers, and was amazed at the decor. It is a smaller place, and the fact that they were very steady for a Tuesday night amazes me. We were given salads as soon as we walked in, I don't know what that dressing was but DAMN, and the feta cheese on top was not too salty, it was just a really good basic salad. Then we ordered the chicken kebap and the #18 pizza which had an assortment of all their pizzas. I really did enjoy the pizzas, but the highlight was that chicken plate. LET ME TELL YOU! That chicken was seasoned sooooo perfectly, and cooked so well and was so moist. Then the roasted vegetables were amazing. I have no idea what they put in that rice to make it taste that amazing, same thing goes for the potatoes, but if someone told me I could only have those two items for the rest of my life I wouldn't be mad. We left and were SOOOO full we couldn't try the dessert which we will next time. 34 dollars for two dishes and salads and we brought half of it home for us to eat tomorrow. Will I be back? Yeahhhhhhhh maybe tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Great food but a weird experience with disorganized service.   Having never tried Turkish pizza before we decided to give it a try. We came on Saturday night, but the front door of the restaurant was closed with a sign telling us to enter through the back.   There was a long line up so we decided to order take out. It was a bit difficult to tell who was working there and there wasn't anyone who was formally designated to taking orders. We waited a while before someone came up to take our order.   We ordered #18, Karisik ($16) which was an assorted pizza of their most popular flavours, giving us a sample of each. He told us it'll take 10 minutes but it ended up taking around 30 and we had to ask them to follow up on our order. The pizza crust was different from pizza you'd get elsewhere. It was softer and more flavourful. It also came with a salad. The salad was alright but the tomato was really pale and didn't look fresh.   What made it a weird experience was that the back entrance was an entrance to their kitchen. Everyone had to walk through their kitchen to get to the tables or get to the cash register to pay for take out. It was a bit interesting as we could see them making their pizzas fresh in the oven and we could see the sauce cooking. However, it was unsanitary and unsafe. When I walked through the kitchen to the cash register to pay, I noticed the door and saw no reason as to why customers weren't able to use it.  In all, I would come back because their food was good. I do hope their front door will be in service next time and they'll be more organized."}
{"text":"This is the best Turkish resto in the city.  Their beef shawarma, their  pides ( beef or mixed cheese and spinach) are very delicious.  Today (8_4_17 ) I went again, but I was disappointed with their iskander plate.. the shawarmah is bland :(( and tastes as if it's from yesterday's leftover. I will give them for iskander less than 1"}
{"text":"Good Ambience. Nice menu selection. Good interior.  Good thing about restaurant I liked is as soon as you enter and sit down on your table They serve you with delicious salad. As a Indian vegetarian I did not like the pizza and the taste. I was really dry as there was no sauce. I like style of the pizza. But it was tasteless for me. I had to add hot sauce. Probably meat lovers will like this place."}
{"text":"A co-worker told me to visit this place for Turkish food and I am glad about the experience. The service was good. The interior of the restaurant has a laid- back vibe where you can enjoy your meal. People come in mostly for their take out orders."}
{"text":"Currently, my favourite Turkish restaurant in Toronto. If you're looking to have iskender, this is pretty much the only real option. I really love iskender and the dish originates from my mother's hometown. Consequently, I had access to some of the best places that make Iskender and I'm very picky about it. In short, trust me, I know this stuff. If I say it's good, it's good.  I think I still like the pide in Mr Pide slightly better but pide in this place is also solid. Just beware that there might be a line-up at the entrance. Otherwise, amazing place."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying Turkish food. A friend took me to this restaurant and I was impressed. The service was great and the place well decorated. The food was also exceptional. Would love to go back for a second round in the future."}
{"text":"This was my first Turkish Pride experience and it was a good one.  Upon entry into the cavernous restaurant, I was shocked to see that they only have Pride's available on weekdays.  So, Pride it is.  I was very happy with the food.  The Pride was crispy and the toppings were fresh.  It came with a salad.  Not a bad deal for 10 bucks when a couple could share one!  The staff was great and there is lots of parking.  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke.  This may be the most unorganized restaurant with the rudest worst service.  What a shame.  The food is great....if you ever get it. Last visit for sure!"}
{"text":"I went to this place for lunch at around noon (if you're planning to go and eat in for lunch, go early be because the tables fill up quickly around 12:30). I ordered number 18 (which is one of the most popular choices according to the server); it's a pide with an assortment of toppings (chicken, Turkish pepperoni, ground beef and lamb or beef for the last one). The chicken and beef/lamb were yummy. The ground beef and pepperoni weren't anything special, I wish it was more spicy/spiced. Every pide (pizza) also comes with salad, which I really enjoyed.   The service is quick and friendly. I just wish it was cheaper, the pide ranges from $10-$14. Since I was eating alone, it seemed fairly expensive for me but I think the pide's are big enough to share between 2 people.  Make sure to get the dessert, even if you're not a sweets kind of person, get one. It's $1.50 for 1 square and I was mildly tempted to get the entire pan."}
{"text":"The place is really good and prices are reasonable. I bought the Lamaçun (No. 1) and even tho it was a bit too greasy for my taste, it was pretty good. I've eaten twice and still have another service left. The service in the restaurant was very good too."}
{"text":"It is a rare place where food is so good that one is willing to overlook service lapses and still award 5 stars.   On Fri, Sat and Sun they do shawerma. This isn't the pressed meat gyro that you might have had elsewhere. They make their own shawerma. And it is heavenly. You can have it plain (wrap or with rice) or as Iskandar Kabab (drowned in a tomatoe sauce with bread and yoghurt). Any way you get it (and i've tried them all), one word describes it: heavenly.   They also do pides (Turkish pizzas) that are just as good.   Now the service is a little hit or miss, but with food this good who cares.   This place proves that a simple menu, executed well, is where it's at..."}
{"text":"Saturday night: disorganized chaos of getting a table (there's a sheet that you write your name on). People crowding at the entrance and waiters skipping names on the list as everyone else waits.  30minute wait for a table of two. Waiter was polite and gave us recommendations and complimentary salad and water. We ordered right away as we had a lot of time deciding as we were waiting for a table and both starving!   40mins past, we asked for more salad as the wait was ridiculous but told it was $4 extra. The tables that were seated after us received their food, so we asked if ours were coming out soon. And...they didn't put our order in. Already over an hour wait just for food and no apologies given. We asked for more salad and they brought one out.   20min wait again and the whole restaurant pretty much finished their meals and left as we're still waiting. We ask again, how long is this going to take, and finally an apology was given and complimentary pistachio baklava was served.  10mins later, our Pide was served and we were finally able to leave.  Food:  Salad- 8/10(and free!) Baklava- 10/10 (so soft and fresh) #1 and #18 Pide-7/10- a little too heavy and expensive for what it was but still tasty  Parking: 1/10- the worst parking situation, only one entrance/exit, line of cars waiting for a shared lot of 15spots.   Environment: 6/10- although the decor and cave-like ambience and chandeliers made you feel like you were in another country, they need more seating and organized seating arrangement.   Service: Although very frustrating/ disorganized, our waiters were nice and tried their best with the busy weekend rush. Would have appreciated an apology at the beginning but satisfied as we left."}
{"text":"Recommended by a Turkish friend to satisfy my carnivorous propensities. It vastly exceeded any reasonable expectation I might've had as to meat to carbohydrate ratio, so I was delighted!  As someone who doesn't have any particular love for red sauce in general, or pizza sauce in particular, it's absence was a pleasant surprise. Completely different style than what us North Americans are used to and very tasty.  Also very interesting desserts which are similar to baklava and apparently have the same ingredients, but a different overall experience and again very tasty.  Got take ou,t however certainly pleasant atmosphere with stone, ivy and wood decor for a sitdown experience."}
{"text":"So authentic and great for groups, my friend and I came here and we ordered 3 dishes to share, the portions are so big and well worth the money! Would definitely go back to try more of their menu"}
{"text":"If you like Doner, this place definitely has the best and closest thing to the real deal. (Currently served Fridays-Sundays)Their Lahmacun is also delicious! I thought their kebab was quite bland but everything else was quite great.  They have recently updated their tables and it's gorgeous! The only downside is their service. It is inconsistent, and the servers forget your orders, and feels really unprofessional when they can't manage the people coming in. You wait for a long time and I would also avoid going on \"rush hour\"."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints.  Unique decor/furniture.  The food is exceptional.  Fresh, quality and huge portions.  Had lunch with a colleague today and ended up taking 3/4 of it home.  The beef/lamb combination with rice and salad is prepared with a lot of finesse.  Their flatware is unique and unusual.  Background hint of oregano and well-seasoned meat.  The moment you sit down, you are presented with a nice salad, various salad greens and good-quality feta cheese.  This is a solid place.  They also have sweets if you're interested in blowing the calorie budget.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really good Pizza Pide. The menu consists of your staple pides + they have an iskander menu as well. The meals run from $10  - $15. They all come with a salad. They have a great selection of imported pops, plus they make some pretty decent turskish tea as well. Their desserts are a super sweet but delicious.  All in, the is your random spot with excellent food and well worth the drive if you feel like pizza, but don't want the heaviness of traditional take out style pizzerias."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing in this place... from their awesome Donor to their Turkish Pizza and the deserts... My favorite place.... Donors go very fast... be there earlier to not miss it..."}
{"text":"Love love love the decor. It reminded me of the time I was in Cappadocia turkey living in cave. The creative decor, friendly service and good food deserves a five star for my dinning experience here.  The price is also very reasonable. For $16, we had a huge lamb and beef pizza with a side salad.  I love this place and will definitely go back to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Wow! This has to be one of my favourite Turkish restaurants hands down!  We did have to wait a little bit as the line up was out the door, which is apparently the usual at this restaurant. That just made my mouth water though because it shows how good it is!   We ordered the pides that came with an assortments of stuffings. My favourite was the one with cheese and beef. I would definitely go back for more!  The service was amazing, servers were very kind and brought out a complimentary salad right as we took our seat   Can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"Super good Turkish/Hahal pizza spot. Dishes are all fresh-made?beef is lean but tasty and soft. Most amazingly?all staff are turkish"}
{"text":"After seeing some pictures of this place a while back, I was eager to try me some Turkish Pizza. Came here after a game of volley-ball, and for a pseudo-celebration, so our table of 7 had quite an appetite!  SERVICE:  Given the very high ratings for this place, not sure if it was just an off-night for staff, but the service here was less than stellar. Our server didn't bring us water, even after being asked twice. She also did not bring us cutlery, or make much effort to explain food/drink options - English could possibly have been her second language, so I will give her the benefit of the doubt there.  FOOD:  The Turkish take on pizza (regardless of how authentic it really is or not - I have no idea) was fantastic! It came hot and nicely baked, with a wide array of topics available that you might not be able to find at your typical pizza joint - I went conservative and ordered the #12 Pepperoni and Egg, and was not disappointed. The crunchy crust came out partially folded-over, and was filled enough with topics to keep us all satisfied.    ATMOSPHERE:  This place would be great if they got a liquor license, but alas, they don't offer drinks here. Still a good place to fill the belly, and hang out with friends. The cave-decor is a unique touch, and I can see children getting a kick out of that.  VERDICT:  I hope the service will be a bit more attentive next time, but I look forward to trying the other pizza selections next time."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere good music  nothing to say bad for this place but I had better iskender for sure."}
{"text":"Great authentic Turkish food,  iv eaten here 4 times and it's always been great.  My favourite thing to get is the baklava."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! We tried Iskander and a few other menu items, was not disappointed with any of them. The interior is also very unique. The space is a little tight though . The service was ok . I would have given 5 stars if the service was better."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the place to go if you've a hankering for some authentic Turkish 'iskender' or 'doner'. Unfortunately they only serve it on weekends but that is because of how it is made and the customer volume during the week. On weekdays you can get all sorts of different Turkish \"pide\" for a very reasonable price. They have a variety of Turkish fruit juices and also ayran, a Turkish yogurt drink. The place used to be a local watering hole and back then somebody thought it would be cool to make the place look like a cave and subsequent owner's didn't put much money into remodeling, so the decor is original and kinda tacky at the same time, but people don't go there for the atmosphere. It is pretty small and space is tight, you can still see the plywood in the ceiling of the extension (that used to be an outdoor patio) but the restaurant is very popular and often very busy. The service is polite and pleasant if a little harried sometimes. The restaurant is located in the corner of a strip mall at the north-east corner of Wilson Ave & Garratt Blvd. There is a tight parking lot with a few spots right out front and you can also park on the street behind, Regent Rd., but there is no parking along Garratt Blvd."}
{"text":"WOW! Blown away by the decor! This place is really unique.. super busy don't recommend coming in a group of more than 4 people they only have a few tables and it's an extremely small restaurant. Mouthwatering food! The lamb was to die for! Pizza was great too!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant! On weekends they offer a special dish called Iskander which is a meat platter! You have to arrive early on Friday or Saturday nights to ensure they still have some available! The prices are very reasonable and you definitely get way more food then you can eat! They also bring a complimentary salad to every person at the table as a starter. Friendly staff. My only feedback is that I wish the restaurant was bigger as it is quite popular and often cannot accommodate all the interested parties leading to a bit of a wait time. Overall very delicious and affordable food."}
{"text":"I went one evening with business client and AMAZING! The combo with every slice of style pizza was yummy! Then at the same time we order one of the meat dishes for $18 and wow taste and it's a lot of food. So my client took home half the pizza and half the meat dish with the vegetables...I will defiantly go back again and again !!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner, late dinner. Food is okay but server mess up my order three times.... Not cool. Maybe they are too busy to care. Like even the server confirm the order in the end and still manage to get it all wrong.... So strange. Environment is great in the inside, the decoration and ceiling makes you feel like you are in a cave environment. They do offer take out."}
{"text":"Was there Saturday around dinner time, there was a long wait, so we decided to get the food to go. Got the meat option with rice, it comes with salad and a man. Portion was huge, enough for 2, for a price of 18 dollars--which was really good. You need to wait for 15-20min for pizza, we will definitely be back to try it (we were in a hurry this time). The restaurant has a very unique interior design, we will try to come back and sit-in for the whole experience."}
