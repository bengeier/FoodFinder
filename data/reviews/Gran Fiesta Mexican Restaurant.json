{"text":"We've been customers of Grand Fiesta since they opened in Strongsville.  While the prices continued to increase the food, margaritas and service were always worth it.  Our last 2 visits however have been very disappointing.  Food and service was just OK while the margaritas we ordered tasted like they were virgin."}
{"text":"The food was pretty average but it did come out of the kitchen pretty fast so I enjoyed that aspect. Some things are kinda price but other aren't. Pretty decent place."}
{"text":"This restaurant is nothing but ohenomenal. The prices are very affordable. ..the food is amazing...the best mexican of any restaurant ive been to thus far. The highlight was how unbleievably hospitable they were! The waitresses every time are so unbelivably helpful..nice..and kind..and we couldnt even get out of the door without being told \"goodbye..have a good day..thanks for coming!\" By five or six different workers! Theyre unbelIevably great people and its an amazing place."}
{"text":"We have been going since they opened.  Food is very fast, margaritas are fantastic!  Highly recommend any Burrito, chimichanga and polo loco.  Service is great, fast and attentive.  If you like it spicy, their homemade hot sauce is fantastic. Small porch out front.  You can find coupons in local saver magazines.  Highly recommend for families, kids are very welcome."}
{"text":"The food and prices are moderate, however the customer service was amazing. Honestly the only reason we go; that and of course the margaritas."}
{"text":"they are serving legit mexican food

I tried fajita and nacho (fiasta nacho? that came with lots of stuff like beef chicken shrimp and of course nacho)

their food is good enough to keep visiting if you like mexican

plus big big portion so you can have it later on

I definitely recommend this place (not super though)"}
{"text":"Drinks are great and people are so nice !!! Margaritas are awesome and they are so quick in bringing you your food"}
{"text":"As far as (American) Mexican food goes, Gran Fiesta is pretty standard.  The restaurant itself is HUGE...like, big enough for them to be able to close an entire section of the dining room on a Friday night- and still not have a wait.  This is a definite plus...I don't like waiting for my Mexican food!

Our server didn't seem to have the world's best grasp on the English language, so we didn't really feel comfortable asking him questions about the menu.  With that said, we played it safe and ordered fajitas and a combination platter.

The entrees hit our table in less than 5 minutes...fast even by Mexican restaurant standards. Unfortunately, I was hoping for a little more of a kick from the food here.  Even the chile relleno wasn't very spicy.  I normally don't have to ask for hot sauce at Mexican places...but it was definitely required here.  The server brought us some house-made hot sauce, and the quality of the food infinitely improved after a couple spoonfuls of the stuff.

Following dinner, I ordered the flan for dessert.  It was horrible...way too heavy, and masked by all kinds of  toppings.  Chocolate sauce and whipped cream on flan??  Totally unnecessary.

Overall, I can't say I had a horrible dinner at Gran Fiesta, but it wasn't anything special by any means.  The meal was really quick and affordable, but not really anything you can't find at any suburban Mexican place."}
{"text":"Food is good, margaritas are even better!  I especially like the homemade salsa, very good & fresh.  Menu is extensive with a wide variety of items to choose from.  Service is above average, & fast!  Takes longer to pick out what you want to eat, then to actually get your food.  The fried ice cream for dessert was delish!  Overall, a great choice if you are hungry for Mexican food.  

Food:  4 out of 5
Drinks: 5 out 5
Decor: 31/2 out 5
Cleanliness: 4 out 5
Service: 5 out 5 

Overall:  4 out 5"}
{"text":"I'm going to make this review short. I liked the salsa. The shredded beef was bland. No real flavor. Needs to be spiced up. When I go to a Mexican restaurant I expect spiced food. I was disappointed because this is part of a well-respected local chain. Sorry."}
{"text":"Truly great Mexican food.  This place is always on point and the food comes out very quickly.  The staff is always great and I have eaten here many times and never had a less than wonderful meal.  They have a mashed potato burrito in the vegetarian section of the menu.... yeah, man... that's right.  A+"}
{"text":"This place was terrific.  The service was OK and the food order came very fast.  The chips were warm and the standard house salsa tasty...plus I ordered the hot and mixed it all into the regular.  I  like spicy and the combo was perfect. For the main course I ordered the combination number 13...which was a chilli relleno , a burrito and an enchilada. One chicken and the other beef. Every one was delicious. For $8.99 I was stuffed and very satisfied. The only thing missing was horchata as they don't serve it. I will definitely return when in the area again."}
{"text":"This is an authentic Mexican restaurant that even has its own little veggie menu section. The service is always great...the salsa is always hot and tangy, and I always leave with a full belly. Too bad you are all the way in OH. I wish we had more places like this in Boston!"}
{"text":"Not horrible, but definitely not impressed. No one knew English well enough to get us both spicy and regular salsa.  Then I ordered a chimichanga which is typically deep fried and crispy even though sauce is poured over the top, but this was an enchilada that was a little crispy on each end?!? Prices a little steep, but that's Strongsville for you. Probably won't be back, plenty of other great Mexican restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Prices are up. Portions smaller. Still good food/service."}
{"text":"This is a favorite local dining spot for my family.  What's not to like?  They are fast, courteous, cheap, and have a wide variety of items to choose from.

We always get their white cheese dip appetizer, and have always liked their chips and salsa (chips are always hot).  My wife loves their Camaron con Arroz dish (shrimp and rice) and I am a fan of both their taco salads and many combination platters.  Their rice and beans are good as well.  Small Margarita pitchers are always on \"special\" and are quite tasty.

An easy \"go to\" spot when we are craving Mexican."}
{"text":"My first grand visit was last night, pulled in and the place was packed. I asked the girl how long of a wait she said 2 mins!! A packed restaurant and a 2 min wait awesome,  got seated and then had to wait 15 mins for water haha that was alittle annoying but they were busy. Ordered the food which came out in a good amout of time, I got 3 tacos and rice it was good, a lot of yummy cheese on the tacos, good size although the meat could of been more flavorful, but still pretty good. Then we had to wait about 15 mins for the check haha. So overall food is good but waiting for stuff too long is annoying, I would go again if I have a taste for mexican and happen to b in sville."}
{"text":"After years of living in Strongsville I've finally gone to Grand Fiesta. I am a very picky eater and I'm not big into Mexican food. Let me say that I will be going back. The restaurant  was very clean, the service was great, and the food was really good. I tried the Burrito California. It was great! And like I said, Mexican isn't my favorite but I was very happy with my meal."}
{"text":"Great Local Mexican Restaurant and great atmosphere. Food is good and nothing too fancy. Staff is very informative and attentive and def recommend."}
{"text":"Standard Mexican American Fare. The salsa is fresh, fast and generous. The service is fast, even when it's crowded. The location is even good with plenty of parking. It just isn't special at all."}
{"text":"The restaurant had a friendly, family atmosphere that was instantly attractive (albeit noisy!). I enjoyed my flaming fajitas! The meat was seasoned well and the veggies were diverse and flavorful. I need a reason to go back! I will say that the TVs were overkill. Showing an Avengers movie, while a good film, in the middle of an already noisy restaurant was simply distracting. Maybe some families welcome the distraction, but I wanted to focus on conversation!"}
{"text":"A fun, friendly and of course colorful establishment. Their chips are perfect with the crunch they have with a decent salsa. Frozen Strawberry Margarita was delicious, but can't say the same for the Strawberry Daquari-although generous on the the alcohol portion. The Cheese Sauce is very delicious so make sure that you get that in addition to the salsa. No need to bother trying the Chicken Tortilla Soup(zero flavor)
We went with the good old Chimichanga Beef & Chicken. I believe that the tortilla is pan fried as opposed to deep fried so it didn't have quite the crunch that it would if it were deep fried. It was very good with exceptional soft Mexican Rice. I would definitely recommend this place when you're craving some south of the boarder eating."}
{"text":"Very unhappy with this place. We stopped in for lunch and there were only a few other guests in the restaurant. We ordered and it took about 15 minutes to get our drinks.. they were very strong so we didn't complain. Wet ordered an appetizer and it didn't come out until after our food after asking about it twice. They gave it to us for free but by the time we went to eat it later that night it was nothing but soggy nachos so free or not,  it was a waste of food. The main meals were pretty tasty and ample so no complaints on the adult food. Our toddler wouldn't eat the tacos we got her because they were smothered in sauce so if your toddler is like ours,  order no sauce lol.. if you like coffee,  try their Mexican coffee,  it was really good."}
{"text":"Extremely upset after an experience at this poor excuse of an establishment. A drunk male was causing a scene, cursing and yelling. He was nicely asked by another patron to watch his language because there was a child sitting behind him. The drunk male then proceeded to cause more of a commotion and threatened to kill the man who had politely approached him. A waiter and the manger were both asked to call to police based on the actions, threats and outbursts of the extremely intoxicated patron. They refused and allowed the male to continue on yelling and drinking. 

As for the food, it's nothing special. It's your typical Mexican options at a higher price. Honestly, save your money and have better food and service elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best Mexican Food in town. Very nice staff and great prices!"}
{"text":"Great margaritas, very accommodating for large groups/parties. Vast menu but not ever item is amazing so choose wisely."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the chimichanga. I would share a picture but I ate it too quickly. :) The cheese dip is good- has a slight kick to it. 4 people in our party ordered the chimichangas and also loved them. It was a busy Saturday night so the service was a tad slow. But we have been here before and the service was quicker. This is a great restaurant and the location, down the road from South Park Center, is great.

Returned at least 3 times since my original review and the food just keeps getting better and better. 5 stars- best Mexican around!"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre and the atmosphere is alright. I prefer going to either Cozumel in Brunswick, or Maya in Middleburg Heights"}
{"text":"I ordered a take out dinner and the chimichangas were made crispy and got the soggiest ones I have ever had. Hope next time is better"}
{"text":"This was a Favorite stop for me every time we have visited Strongsville, key word being Was. Server was not interested in our party of four adults and three tweens. Bland salsa when our entrees arrived they looked and tasted like they were prepared day before and placed in microwave just before being served. Won't go Back."}
{"text":"The best authentic Mexican restaurant in Strongsville ( & I think the only).  Can't go wrong with the fijitas.  Fast service."}
{"text":"We have been here around 10 times now, and without fail, every single time we eat here, the food is amazing.  The service is always great and friendly.  The salsa and chips are so good we order some to go as well.  They even gladly gave us information for my wife's special diet.  The margaritas are strong too!  Best Mexican restaurant we've tried, anywhere.  Love it!!  Definitely check it out if you are nearby."}
{"text":"Great service! Everyone is always so friendly. They come across as genuinely happy you're there. Good food every time we go there, which is a lot!"}
{"text":"We have been meaning to try this please and yesterday we did. It was dinner time, quite busy. Chips and salsa right away. They don't carry Bud light lime. (surprising, not even winter) We ordered combos. mine was Taco, burrito, and chalupa, the taco and burrito were excellent, the chalupa was not what I expected , what I am familiar with (and wanted) was the way taco bell does it with the crepe shell, this was a soft flat doe, did not care for it. My wife thought the food was authentic. The service was good. Median prices."}
{"text":"Location: Good location on Route 82 in Strongsville. Easy to get to with plenty of parking.

Atmosphere: Warm, comfortable and inviting. Can either sit at table or booth. Good lighting, Mexican décor, soft Mexican music in background. 

Service: Spanish-speaking staff is lalways friendly and quick. And I mean quick, my food is always there before I have time to finish my Margarita. 

Menu: Loaded with the typical Mexican dishes plus some I am not familiar with. Lots of choices

Food: Always good and plentiful and I usually end up taking some home. The beef fajitas are delicious."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what a Mexican (American) restaurant should be.  Warm nachos and fresh salsa on the table.  Cold Dos Equis beer, Frozen Margaritas with lots of tequila.  Delicious Southwestern food.  
My wife got the fajitas, they looked great.  I had the Combo #13: chilli relleno, burrito, enchilada.  The chilli relleno was quite good!  It had lots of good spicy heat, and the melted cheese was perfect.  

I'm not sure why people gripe about this kind of place.  I think, for the record, it should be noted that Rick Bayless is a smug douchebag.  How does one get a show on PBS?  Be a great chef?  No, those are a dime a dozen, and found more easily on food network.  Seriously, what gets you a show on PBS is the magnitude of your capacity for douchey smugness.  Case in point: Rick Bayless, Rick Steves, and pretty much anyone who has a cooking show on that channel.  Don't let them be your guide to restaurant faire of any kind, least of all ethnic varieties.

I lived in Mexico with a host family, and Mexican food shares little in common with what passes for it in the USA.  Yet, most of the people running Mexican Restaurants here are of Mexican descent.  Why is that?  Are they traitors to their culture?  Are they maleducados, destruyando la raza?  NO!  It's because when they arrived here, they realized that most Americans don't really enjoy eating chicharron, chapulines, and mole, even though those things are absolutely authentic.  These entrepreneurs did what any good businessman does: market research.  

So, upon what shall we judge \"Mexican\" restaurants?

1.  Atmosphere--Gran Fiesta has a good one, and they make birthdays fun with a sombrero.
2.  Flavor--Gran Fiesta's food is delicious, and reminiscent of Mexican food in all the right ways.  Their free salsa is delicious!
3.  Good value for portion sizes--Check
4.  A decent beverage menu--yup
5.  Pleasant, efficient servers--yes!

The only reason that Gran fiesta doesn't get 5 full stars from me is that their dining room is a little dated and could use an upgrade."}
{"text":"The FOOD ROCKS! A great local place for awesome drinks and authentic food that is just to die for."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner after my son's ice skating lessons and I was really impressed with the staff at this place, however the food was sub par. Don't get me wrong it was ok, edible, but lacking flavor and spice....a very Americanized version of what \"Mexican\" food should be. I'm always really hesitant to try new Mexican food restaurants specifically for this reason. I've got my go to places and really hope for the best when trying something different. On the plus side they did have a baby changing table in the ladies room , parking was a breeze, and the service was fast!"}
{"text":"I went to Grand Fiesta this past weekend for the first time. The experience was just ok. The food was pretty bland, the service was barely there. We even checked out the Yelp reviews before trying it. Again, if you are in the mood for average Mexican food give it a try."}
{"text":"I've been going to gran fiesta ever since they opened when I was a kid and it's still number one. Can't go wrong. Af the point where the waiters know me when I come in. Great salsa and great quest. Never had anything on the menu I didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"The food was quick & delicious. A lot more options than your standard Mexican restaurant. The pork & chorizo burrito with jalapeños in green sauce was awesome. Homemade hot sauce served in a bowl not crappy Tabasco. The margarita texanas were sooo yummy & mighty strong for lunch! Haha. Parent bonus: there is a changing table in the bathroom!!"}
{"text":"Similar to my quest for the best pizza, I'm always on the hunt for the best Mexican restaurant; a Mexican restaurant that is \"authentic.\" 

I don't think I've found it at Gran Fiesta. What I have found, however, is a great American-Mexican restaurant that is really trying to please its customers. Absolutely fantastic service. Smiles and greetings everywhere you turn. 

Great care is also taken in their presentation. I mean, I got a burrito. How many times have you seen a burrito plated in such a way as this at any other American-Mexican restaurant? Usually it's just slapped on the plate in a pool of runny refried beans and crunchy rice. Not at Gran Fiesta. Like I said; they're really trying. 

The chips and salsa are good; not great, and the margheritas could maybe use a little more tequila, but if you want to have a good time in a Mexican Theme restaurant, go treat yourself and your friends to Gran Fiesta."}
{"text":"This was a cute family owned restaurant, but they need to work on their service.  The food quality was good, not great.  The waitstaff was slow and forgetful.  We asked for water four times before she remembered to bring it.  Also, my enchiladas arrived with out cheese melted on top so I requested some from the waiter, which I never received.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"The service is quick, is clean and super great food. 
they do speak spanish there so as a mexican person my self it feels just like home to go in and be able to speak to every one in the staff like they are family. They do get super busy! 
The service still does not suffer they are so great with it, The food is fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place, food was good. Went early and seated right way.  Waitress was the best, very nice and helpful. Typical bar selection, many choices on the menu. Price is not out of sight, inline with other restaurants. I will be going back."}
{"text":"I've been going to Gran Fiesta since it first opened and this is one of the best authentic Mexican restaurants around. We've gone so much that we have gotten to know the waiters and waitresses. The service is usually always good unless we have somebody new and then it can be a little slow. The menu is HUGE! Hard to go wrong with an item on the menu. Also good to know is they are very accommodating to large groups if you come in with one. Only downside is they don't have the best drink and margarita menu since they don't have a true bar, but good place to grab a quick bite to eat. They are often frequently crowded so you know it's good!"}
{"text":"Ok, at first I was going to give this place 4 stars, but then I noticed overall it only had 3 and a half stars, which doesn't fly with me. It's at the very least, at the very very least a 4 star restaurant concerning Mexican food. 

I've only been to this establishment twice, but was highly impressed with the quality of food and the great service. Their Salsa is phenomenal, perfectly balanced in taste and texture. I love that you can actually taste the fresh cilantro, and that the salsa is not over salted nor over sweetened. It tastes fresh because it is fresh. So that's a good thing, ladies and gentlemen. 

The portions for the price here are excellent and you will always have leftovers, at least I do. Everything just seems so fresh from this place, and this is coming from someone who cooks almost every single night with good produce. So it's rare for me to rave about a restaurant like this.

I love the service here; We have been lucky enough to get the same waitress both times when we visited. There is also a small, funny guy that comes around to service your refill needs. This guy had me laughing so hard! He asked me if I wanted more salsa, and I said no, he said \"You sure?\" at least 5 times in a row. It wasn't meant to be rude, it was meant to be funny and joyful...I ended up saying yes. lol! I did want more, but I was just so stuffed as is. lol

So yeah, this is a great place to feel good and eat some awesome Mexican food. 

P.S. The only reason I was originally going to give this place 4 stars, is because I have only been here twice. Sometimes that's enough though, you know? :)"}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite! We've been going here for years and it's always amazing! The staff is great and we've even become great friends with some of them who are now like family. My favorite Restaraunt is Gran Fiesta!!!!"}
{"text":"Thumbs down,can't think of any good about lunch challenge here. Should have gone to Wendys.Worst Mexican in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The food had very little flavor. From the very runny/liquid salsa to the entrees there was very little taste. The portions were also pretty small for the price you had to pay."}
{"text":"Food was average for a Mexican place. But the service was the real issue here. Horrible service. Waited very long for our order."}
{"text":"This is the cleanest Mexican restaurant I have ever been to!!! Their fajitas are sooooo good and you get a big portion! Their queso is the best I have ever had and their margaritas are perfection! 
The service has always been good and very quick!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Gran Fiesta for years. The food is always great as well as the staff. One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Had dinner here about 11 days ago. have gone here for years but had not been in the area for business for several years.

Had a version of Mexican BBQ a pork dish with a Colorado sauce. Magnificent pork mix with burnt ends of pork better than any pork I have had in a barbecue restaurant in recent memory. The red mild Colorado sauce was flavorful and great and the rice and beans on the side are always good.

He homemade tortilla chips and salsa was a great starter... Guacamole was only average but you want a main course! service was fabulous. the always packed house should be a sign that they serve good food there is a lot of competition in the area"}
{"text":"Me Gusta tu grande chorizo.

Of the 30 mexican places in Cleveland that are all basically the same this one stands out!  The \"decor\" is mui caliente.  The \"space\" is as wide open as a pair of buttcheeks at a gay rodeo.  The \"cuisine\" is tasty.  Servers are always friendly but never know what the booze specials are.  The poster by front door has em so school Pablo on what they are when he walks over.  Good prices and they have coupons in local coupon books if thats your thing.  Its across from the police station so be careful when ya pound 30 margarits and Dos Equis ambers.  I hear they do cavity searches.  Yikes!"}
{"text":"Zero complaints, amazing restaurant in Strongsville. The staff is friendly and the food is good. We go during peak hours and get seated in 10-15 minutes at the most. Try going to a certain Lakewood taco establishment during peak hours. 

Bottom line, check this place out and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"On a birthday mall trip and googled a Mexican restaurant. This one came up on the list of choices. First impression walking in was \"wow  this is nice\". The staff are authentic. Great touch. Close to the highway. Plus it smells fantastic. The salsa was the most fresh prepared appetizer on the menu, and its free lol. I bought some to take home. Our good was EXCELLENT. My new favorite restaurant. I'll drive an hour, no big deal"}
{"text":"We've really tried to like this restaurant, visiting at least 3 times, but it just is nothing special.  The food is okay.  The service is okay.  And the sound level in the restaurant can be deafening.  On one occasion, we walked out after being seated because we could not hear ourselves talk.
It seems to be a popular restaurant in Strongsville, where there are all manner of places to eat, but there doesn't seem to be much competition on the Mexican food front.
We have stopped going here."}
{"text":"The other reviews here surprise me a bit - there are two things I would dispute - 1) The salsa is NOT hot at all, it was kind of oddly mild, tasted almost like tomato soup - I actually really liked it.  2) The service here, in my experience, is far from great.  I honestly can't really tell you much about the food because the entire time I was there I couldn't stop thinking about how INCREDIBLY slow the service was.  A waitress didn't even ask us what we wanted to drink until at least 15 minutes.  Then probably another 15 to ask us for our food orders.  Food came out at an appropriate time after we ordered, but we still waited forever for our checks.  It was 3:30 pm on a Sunday - definitely not a busy time for them.  As far as authentic Mexican restaurants in Cleveland go, Cozumel of Independence is still the at the top of the list for me."}
{"text":"Decent fast lunch and a good choice of standard cuisine and good mexican beers.  

Only been there for lunch, but the entrees sound good."}
{"text":"Gran Fiesta is a solid Mexican joint! Right when you sit down they greet you with chips and salsa, so that is a nice touch. I always order the fajitas and request 1/2 beans and 1/2 rice so I don't have to choose between the two! The fajitas have always been good so I never really feel like trying anything else! The margaritas are cheap and strong! I don't know what else you would want from this restaurant, but this is surely a place to go for an inexpensive meal if you're craving Mexican.

Note: Look online or in the paper, they always have coupons floating around!"}
{"text":"Ordered Picco de Gallo and guacamole which I'm apparently supposed to eat with my fingers since chips are not complimentary with either of those orders."}
{"text":"This could be my favorite Mexican place in the area.  We went on a Friday night at an early 5:30pm, yet the parking lot was nearly full!  Glad there seems to be plenty of tables inside.  Decor is casual with our table covered with a Cleveland Browns motif.  The waitress was very friendly and checked back often to see how we were doing and to refill water and salsa.  The salsa and chips were excellent.  Probably the best salsa I've tasted in the area--seemed very fresh and still chunky.  The wait was a little long given how busy it was so it was nice having good salsa and chips.  We tried the grilled tilapia and the Texas Fajita.  Both were excellent and nicely grilled.  There were two good sized tilapia filets with the meal and the Texas fajita had plenty of meat--not mostly vegetable like other places.  Definitely will repeat!"}
{"text":"The prices are reasonable and the portions are big. I always get the tacos, and while they are good the cheese is strange, like it is imitation cheese (I'm not saying it is, it just seems that way). The service is fast and the place is clean. The menu is huge. Their salsa and chips that they bring you is outstanding. I've been back a few times. It's good food for the price and portion."}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant! Salsa is very good and they have a nice selection of drinks reasonably priced. Must try!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant in Strongsville!  Menu is huge!  They have all the standards and they are all good.   Burritos, chimi's, enchiladas...but you really owe it to yourself to try some of the house special dishes.  Beer and margaritas are also served grande style.  Watch for the drink specials."}
{"text":"Not a huge Mexican food fan, I haven't been here in years.  Went an hour before closing on a Monday for some margaritas.  Very friendly employees that didn't hate us for arriving so close to closing.

 Got some chorizo con queso dips and chips with the complimentary salsa.  Food was good, although heavy cheese with sausage isn't exactly the perfect pair with a margarita.  My fault on that one. 

I'd frequent more if I had a taste for Mexican."}
{"text":"The best mexican place in the area! Hit up the patio in the summer with some margaritas.  I love the fajitas, and the chorizo and chicken dinner plate is the bomb (especially  for the price)!  This place will usually run you $9-$12 per person but it is soo worth it.  So much food that it's near impossible to eat in one siting."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices and great service. Really loud inside but outside was fine.  Luckily the weather was nice."}
{"text":"Love it here. Nice interior. Margaritas were made awesome. Food was great and service was fast. 
Drinks and chips refilled promptly. 
I would definitely go again."}
