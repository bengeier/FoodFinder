{"text":"I came here for lunch after reading previous reviews, and now I'm hooked! I come here at least twice a week now and love the salad and soup bar, as well as the red curry. Delicious!"}
{"text":"We came here on a double date and both parties where blown away by the flavor of their entrees. This visit was on a Friday night, and we all know going out to dinner on a Friday is gonna be a wait. This place is really popular, so if you don't want to wait go before the dinner rush. 

The food and service once we got sat were well worth the wait. This is why we've continued to come back. We always seem to get sat in Clarissa's area. She is so upbeat and genuinely happy to see us. Whenever we have questions she provides with more than enough information to help us make our choice. She's even brought us samples of the sauces used in dishes to see if we'll like them. This is AMAZING customer service. 

Here's what we've had that I HIGHLY recommend:
902 (yes, I know it's fried rice, but the flavor is unlike any other typical fried rice I've had)
403,400,306,854.  

The only I haven't been too crazy about is the golden curry puffs. I felt they were bland. One out of the many we've had isn't bad. 

Can't wait to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"I thought the service was good and it is a very pretty restaurant. But, my good was just okay. I ordered a beef salad and while the flavor was good, the meat was really tough and it was hard to eat. The Tom Kah soup I had was a nice sized portion, but I thought the spice (heat) overwhlemed the flavor."}
{"text":"Excellent food with very friendly and attentive service. Tom yum was very good and the pineapple red curry was delicious. Was a little milder than some Thai I've had but the hot level was a good medium. Sticky rice with mango and coconut ice cream makes a great finish."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the valley.  I have been to others with better pad thai and better tom yum soup, but try the drunken noodles or the pad prik king - nice."}
{"text":"Yuphas is by far the best Thai food in the east valley, possibly the phx metro area. The red and green curries are some of the best I've had in the US and Yuphas fried rice is to die for. Really comfortable environment and friendly service. They have a great lunch special that features all you can eat salad with a Thai peanut dressing and vegetable soup with your order, it's a really good deal and there are always great specials, my favorite this far being the kao soi."}
{"text":"I went there last night for take out for the first time. Holy crap! This place is amazing!!! We got pad Thai and some beef dish with peppers and green beans. So good! 

Only one criticism: they very clearly did not want us to order. We ordered for pick up at 8:30 and they close at 9. They made sure we knew that they did not appreciate our order both on the phone and when we got there. I debated giving them 4 stars because of that but the food was so dang good I can't bring myself to knock off a star. We will see what they are like next time."}
{"text":"We love all of their curries! (Even my girlfriend, who likes the lowest spice) The staff at Yupha's are pleasant and it's a great stop before or after seeing a movie.`"}
{"text":"Great yellow curry, pad Thai, and drunken noodles. We usually get take out, but have eaten in and gotten great service."}
{"text":"Great Thai food! My favorite dish is their shrimp with coconut curry & pineapple!! They always have friendly staff and a great ambiance! It's also in a great location right next to the Tempe Cinema."}
{"text":"I did not like the food in this place at all. It was overpriced bad Thai food. They said they prices are moderate but there were expensive even more for the quality of food. I ordered the pad Thai just was the worst I ever had.  Pad Thai was rice noodle mix with ketchup or similar. Awful! The kids teriyaki had a sauce that tasted fermented. The yellow curry had potatoes that tasted like they where cook a feed days ago. I will not go bad neither I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I saw this resaurant when I went to the discout movie theater.  Since I like Thai food I had to try it.  Very glad I did.  Really good food - full of flavor.  The special seafood dish was full of fresh seafood and had a sauce with lots of citrus notes.  The people running this are very friendly.  I got medium heat with some trepidation since I can not eat extemely hot food.  It was just right, spicy but not burning hot.  If you like your food really hot I would get hotter."}
{"text":"I just had the pleasure of discovering Thai cuisine at this restaurant. A friend and I work near by at Supercut's and had been hearing rave reviews about this place. So, we decided to check it out. When we went the sign had already switched to \"closed\" and my friend decided to check the door anyway. We walked in, since there was still people there and they had no problem seating us, a great start. We ordered Buddha delight, and crab puff to start. Both of these were amazing. For the main course we ordered tom yum goong, which is a delicious and spicy soup (if you can't take the heat i suggest you go with mild.) After our soup we asked the waiter if we could have the fried banana and the flambed fried ice cream. She said she would ask to the chef's since it was already quite late, which was understandable. To our surprise the chef's said, no problem. The deserts were fantastic ! I will definitely be back ! 

Note: They do warn you about the spiciness in the menu, you have four levels of spice to choose from so choose carefully."}
{"text":"Yea for Yupha's!

Definitely a fun favorite!  Used to eat lunch here frequently when I worked nearby.  Soup and peanut dressed salad bar accompany the lunches - which is nice when you come in hungry - you can hit the ground running.  The staff is very nice - it got to the point where they would simply order for me when the special was particularly good that day...  Good flavors, good environment!  Had the Panang this evening, very tasty!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at this restaurant. Good food but a bit on the small side. The service was terrible and I am hesitant to return. We came during dinner time on a weekend so understandably it was busy. Once we were seated, the waitress came to take our drinks and then never came back for our food order. We thought perhaps she was waiting for the rest of our party to arrive, but even after everyone was seated we were still left waiting with no acknowledgement for at least 15 minutes until we had to flag someone down. I would not say it was because they were understaffed - parties around us were having their orders taken even though they had arrived after us. To top it off, they added the 18% automatic gratuity to the bill even though our party was less than 6 people! They didn't deserve a tip at all."}
{"text":"So good. I seem to find my way into this wonderful place at least once a week. 

My go to dish is the Pad See Ew with tofu. I also get the Panang curry quite a bit. If I want something more fried the Curry Puffs will always put a smile on my face.

Top notch and always super friendly."}
{"text":"GREAT THAI - GREAT LUNCH SPECIALS

I admit, i'm a Yupha's die-hard lunch crowd fan.  I go in with friends and the waitress both remembers us and remembers our standard lunch orders.  I have a hard time saying anything negative about this restaurant.

Me?  I'm a big fan of the Drunken Noodles, Pad Gra Pow, and of course, the Pad Thai.  Also, tofu (fried or soft) is always an option for every lunch dish.  The staff readily and easily makes dietary exchanges - I get brown rice and no eggs. 

oh and it's the perfect place to test your heat index.  I get HOT regularly, but it seems that Monday's lunchtime chef is a bit sadistic.  Be careful.  You can always add crushed red pepper at the table.  They do not accept take-backs if you ordered it too hot."}
{"text":"Great selection of authentic Thai food.
Service gets to be bad when it is busy. Had to ask the hostess to get a Togo box when the waitress disappeared."}
{"text":"Wow. Great authentic food and atmosphere. Actually wrapped the sticky rice in a banana leaf (haven't seen that done except in Laos). Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Tried Yupha's for the first time tonight before catching a cheap movie next door. Although I ordered to-go, the interior was nice and the staff was extremely friendly. Best Pad See Ew I've had in a while. I wolfed it down like there was no tomorrow. I get this dish at every Thai place I go to and this one is up there with the best, if not the best. Looking forward to trying it again if I'm ever in the area. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant EVER. It doesn't matter what you order, just close your eyes and put your finger on something- it will be amazing.
Yupha's has a great atmosphere, I will never tire of staring at that beautiful green painting with the boats- which is lucky since a new boat themed Yupha's painting has been added to the back wall :)
The staff is super sweet- they always remember mine and my boyfriend's order when we come in- and often tease me about my aversion to spices, haha! As for Yupha herself- she is kinda like the queen of Thai food here in phoenix but, that is just my opinion ;)

My favorite dishes are the Pad Thai and Pad Woo Sen- but seriously, it is all amazing!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had, hands down. I mean it is lick-the-plate good. I've tried several items on the menu, but keep coming back to the yellow curry and Thai-fried rice. I like spicy food and find the medium setting to be just right. My son orders triple-Thai-hot and loves it. Service is good, price for value is good. Seriously, an excellent meal every time."}
{"text":"Been eating lunch at Yupha's for a few years. All delightful experiences. Wasn't into Thai food before discovering this gem.

The exceptional Kao Pad (fried rice) doesn't look or taste like your typical fried rice. The house sauce they use for Pad Pak is droolworthy. And the spring rolls are the best i've had.

If you dine-in for lunch and order a meal, you get the salad bar. Not a lot of variety (kale, cabbage, cucumber, carrot...) but it's always very fresh. Smother with the HPS (Holy Peanut Sauce) for some gustatory nirvana. 

Decor is earthy and artistic. Only unintrusive, instrumental Thai music plays. On the front counter (an actual work of art btw), there's always an offering of fresh food for the Buddha. When it gets real busy (every day) watch the amazing Sam sprout a 3rd and 4th arm to keep the place running and the customers happy.

If you go for lunch, try to arrive by 11:30 because they really pak it in. Just don't get there before me."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great food and great service. Highly recommend the chicken pad Thai."}
{"text":"I love thai food, this is the best in the valley. Everything here is especially great, from the Pad Thai which is my favorite to more unusual dishes. The service and atmosphere is exceptioonal as well. Try it, you will be hooked like me."}
{"text":"Best Thai place not only in Tempe, but in the Phoenix area.

For an appetizer, I have never encountered Siam Wraps at any other Thai restaurant, but the minced chicken wrapped in lettuce is reason enough to visit. 

For a soup, their Tom Yum is perfect. I'll just leave it at that. 

Their Drunken Noodles and Pad Thai are exactly what they should be with fresh meat and vegetables. I'm not a huge curry fan, so I can't speak to that, but if you love noodle dishes, you're going to the right place.

Their levels of spiciness are fair. If you want spicy food, order it Thai hot. I like food that's considered spicy by the most and it's perfect for me. However, if you want VERY spicy food, have a conversation with your waiter and they'll surely accommodate you."}
{"text":"My favorite thai restaurant in the Phoenix area.  Great panang curry, drunken noodles, and a tasty orange chicken lunch special that they will sometimes make even when it isn't a special.  If they ever start delivering food, I'd probably order three times a week."}
{"text":"Came here after gym with my wife and great ambiance along with a nice authentic Decor. Food was great.. We got the tom yum soup and the eggplant entree.. Great stuff! We'll be back"}
{"text":"I like their food, it is very good but they only get 3 stars because of poor service. If you go anytime between 8:30 pm and 9:00 pm and they close sharply at 9:00pm, their service will even go down 2 notches. They want you out of the restaurant right at dot of 9. Again food is delicious but service??"}
{"text":"we went again yesterday for lunch. still as good as the last time (and that's sayin' somethin'!). and they were crazy-busy with the lunch crowd, which is a good sign to us. also, when you see Thai natives eating the food, you know it has to be good!!! can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. The Pad Thai and Satay are great and the atmosphere is very nice."}
{"text":"Love the red curry. Not a fan of drunken noodles because there is egg in it. Definitely my favorite for curry though."}
{"text":"One bite and I felt like I was in Thailand, all that was missing was the sand to sink my toes in.  I had a seasonal special which had pumpkin.  It was fabulous.  My husband had the green curry and he had it hot just the way he liked it.  He usually eats things extremely spicy but the hot but perfect, he did not order the Thai hot which could have been too hot even for him.  The wine list was pretty good for a Thai place.  I will most definitely be going back for more."}
{"text":"Great food!!!!!!! I always love their drunken noodles and any curry dish. Salad bar during lunch is a great tough and has delicious peanut dressing. Service has always been great. However Our waitress last time took our order and sat at booth at front and talked to another waitress and was on her phone for forever. We had to ask someone else 15 minutes later if we could get our drinks we ordered. Oh well, I go back to restaurants for their impressive food. Of course I'll be back to Yuphas!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food! Kat is the best worker/server there! She always provides great customer service and makes sure everyone is having a good time!"}
{"text":"Best thai food on the east side of town in the tempe, mesa, chandler area. Large portions to share with a friend or to split multiple dishes. Great thai custard dessert :) try it."}
{"text":"Food is great thats why I go there . A friend had mentioned to me how at yuphas the owner came up to their table when they were still finishing up and wanted them to leave so the next people could get a seat . Today the same thing happened , I still had the soup and salad I was finishing up , my friends were still eating ,their was food on their plates and the owner comes and says to me looks like you have finished and your check is also here . I did not appreciate this at all .Looks like you cannot enjoy a meal here without being rushed ."}
{"text":"It's an awesome thai restaurant and their peanut sauce at salad bar is a thing to die for. My office is not very far from this place and everyone in my team is always ready when we decide to go to Yupha's. This place is generally packed at lunch, so advise is to call before if you have a large party.  As with every thai restaurant, if you are vegetarian ask them to avoid fish sauce. Highly recommended overall !!!"}
{"text":"The food was great, except when I was surprised and look puzzled with how fast the dish came out, the waitress gave me a dirty look."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Got the yellow curry and Thai iced coffee. Top notch, very flavorful, super nice and attentive wait staff, reasonably priced. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We had great experiences here several times, but our last experience was one that we won't be coming back.  We arrived around 9:30, when they close at 10.  Which most places means they seat until 10.  They seemed annoyed that we were there that late, reminding us of when they close right away.  The dish that I usually got and thought was the best I had ever had at a Thai restaurant, was suddenly the worst.  There was hardly any meat and instead of putting brocoli in it, it was littered with little stubs from the stalks.  It was basically a plate of few noodles and tons of little brocoli stems.  When they saw I didn't like it and I told them why, they just brushed it off and didn't do anything to resolve the issue.  Too bad, I really liked the place and had been there at least 10 times, and now never again.  Mostly because of how they didn't resolve my compliant.  There are other Thai restaurants, so long!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai in Arizona! And I am a Thai food connoisseur. Awesome food. Great, friendly staff. Short wait time. Nice atmosphere. Fast cooking time. Mainly order for take out, but they provide great dine in service as well."}
{"text":"Excellent pad thai, great ambiance"}
{"text":"Yup, it's located on the SE corner of McClintock and Elliott as others have noted.

I've been here for lunch twice, and both times, it was very good.  There's a soup and salad buffet that comes with lunch, too!  I've tried the Pad Gra Prow and Red Curry.  Both are excellent, and plenty hot if you order it that way!  Portions are generous!  Service is great!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, incredible service.

Went with a group of six people and all the food ordered was fresh and well prepared.  Some dishes of note were the green curry (ordered medium, nice amount of spice, although not for the meek) and the pad prik khing.  The chili garlic sauce on the latter was delish.  The perfect amount of sweet and spicy. 

The owner was there and made excellent recommendations to those in the party who did not know what to order.  We will certainly go back.

This restaurant compares favorably to Thai Basil, which we also like very much."}
{"text":"Had a very nice dinner here on a recent Friday evening. Even the mild is pretty spicy so be careful but the food was delicious, and service good too. Prices are slightly higher than average but it's a nice place!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in the Phoenix area - and I love some good Thai food.  I've been to many Thai restaurants and none of them stack up against Yupha's.  You would be hard pressed to find better food and a nicer atmosphere and staff than Yupha's!"}
{"text":"I just had lunch at the restaurant; they make good food and the prices are fair; the waitress started pressuring us to leave after 45 minutes indirectly; finally the hostess came over and asked us to leave.We were there a total of 1 hour and had already tipped over 20%.  Good lesson in business---your lack of space became my problem; also, if you had asked rather than bully us out of the place, you would probably have a customer willing to return.  Instead, you will get the opposite. First time I have ever been asked to leave a restaurant.  It was weird!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Yuphas for about three years, and an absolutely addicted to their drunken noodles! Their staff is really quick for lunch service (which comes with a small salad bar and vegetable soup, and spring roll), which is great for a workday lunch. I'm really excited that they're now open for lunch on the weekends too. My friends and I are regulars and the staff always remember our orders and bring us extra hot chili sauce. I highly recommend Yuphas!"}
{"text":"I visited Yupha's for a quick lunch and enjoyed the Red Tofu Curry and Rice.  The dish was excellent and the restaurant had a good vibe and was inviting.  I'll definitly be back to try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I love Thai and this was worth it. Great atmosphere, short wait, great food, great price! Will be back."}
{"text":"Used to work nearer to this place, unfortunately we moved.  BUT, I still try to make it hear every few weeks.  Best Thai I've had in Phoenix area.  It's a nice environment to eat-in at as well.   TRY IT!!"}
{"text":"Our experience at Yupha's was bomb dot com.  The menu is a little intimidating at first since every dish has its authentic Thai name, but the numbers next to them helped.  We asked for some dishes to be spicy while others not to be and it turned out great.  The spicy dishes gave a kick wile the mild ones still gave a full flavor.  

I suggest to order by the numbers though, since there is sometimes a little lost in translation.  All together I really suggest Yupha's, especially if you are sharing amongst a large group!"}
{"text":"Everything was great.

Tom Kha soup was fresh (but not sure if that's because my husband asked for it with no mushrooms, regardless they offered the option and it was so good!)

They have \"Thai Hot\" and on the menu state that if it is too hot you can't send it back to the kitchen.  I wasn't totally destroyed by the hot, but I'm not sure whether it's because my hot tolerance really has gone through the roof or they secretly went a little easy on me because I'm a nerdy little white girl.

They have the AC blasting so if you're one of those get cold easily because you're dressed for the 90 degrees outside - bring a jacket.

Oh and their coconut ice cream sticky rice dessert was AMAZING.

And like the other review said they are off McClintock now at the Tempe theater shopping center.   Southeast corner of McClintock and Elliot."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic.  During my first dinner at Yupha's, I remember commenting that these people really give a shit -- and that, to me, is the difference between an awesome restaurant and an average one.

Everything from the freshness of the ingredients, the tenderness of the fish, the crispness of the vegetables, the delicacy of the herbs and spices, the aroma of the Jasmine tea, the texture of sticky rice -- you name it, and these guys are all over it.

I highly recommend the curries, the tilapia, the garlic and pepper dishes, and, of course, the sticky rice desserts.

If there's one downside to this place for me, it's that their vegetarian options are somewhat lacking in all menu sections.  But since I eat fish, eggs, and dairy products, I can deal.  If you're vegan, you may find it a bit challenging to order straight off the menu.

This is one of my absolutely favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Yupha's has flavorful food and great customer service! I always tend to order the same entree, yellow curry or the pad Thai but they are always so good that I never venture from ordering anything new! The Thai tee and Thai coffee are the best that I have yet had! The waiters and waitresses are always quick and friendly. I also love the ambiance inside. My boyfriend and I love coming here for relaxing dinner dates."}
{"text":"Just had a great birthday dinner for my husband here. Attentive staff, yummy food, and a birthday dessert... couldn't ask for more. Highly recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"The food is great but a bit salty. Btw, i have had the drunken noodle."}
{"text":"The restaurant ambiance and food was very good. We are vegetarians and often struggle to find good food outside and this was a perfect place for us. We ordered Buddha's delight and other tofu curry with rice. It was delicious. The prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  I ordered multiple items for a large group of people and everything was great. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time with a friend, enjoyed a yummy dinner and a bottle of wine....But they were very pushy when closing time came. She literally took my glass off the table with wine still in it. She came back every two minutes asking if we needed stuff and was very pushy. It pissed me off. They took the bottle of wine off the table and the lights came up like we were at some damn middle school dance and it was over. I was annoyed. For customer service they get 2 stars. For food, 5."}
{"text":"We ordered the TomYum soup with chicken, Pad Thai and golden curry puff. The Pad Thai and golden curry puff is really good. The soup is kinda disappointing. Only some mushrooms and few pieces of chicken in it. The Tom Yum soup I had in Chandler has silver noodle and vegetables in it. The service is good. I might just come back for the curry puff."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places I've been to in the Valley. The drunken noodles and yellow curry are great."}
{"text":"Our friends go to this joint a lot and raved about it so we decided to give it a try since we were in the area.  We've both been to Thailand numerous times and have frequented plenty of local as well as out-of-state Thai restaurants...and this place was a real let down.

We ordered the Pad See Ew and the Spicy Eggplant (w/shrimp & chicken) and also Thai ice tea.  We ordered both dishes at a level \"1\" spicy.  Even though we both could eat medium spicy...we weren't in the mood for really spicy food...so decided to go w/a \"1\" just for a little kick.

I can pretty much predict how the food is going to be by judging the Thai ice tea...and it appeared too clear, tasted watered down (lacking in the essential tea flavor), too sweet & had an artificial sweetener after taste.

My Spicy Eggplant looked beautiful upon arrival and I got my hopes up...but once I dug in...it was way too spicy.  I'm not sure if there was no flavor to my dish or if it was so spicy I couldn't taste the flavor.
When the lady came back to ask me how my food was and I told her it
was really spicy for a 1...she told me I should order it non-spicy the
next time.  I thought that was kind of dismissive since I didn't want
my food non-spicy...just at the level that I ordered and could enjoy.  All the meat & vegetable also looked like it had been steamed or boiled and then a sauce poured over it...no absolutely no pan sauteed look, smell or taste.

Our Pad See Ew noodle was mushy and unappetizing...and it didn't taste too much better than it looked.  I did notice that it wasn't as oily as stirred fried noodles usually are so maybe that's why it was clumpy & mushy?

One good thing I do have to say about the place is that the decor and ambiance was really nice and the rest of the wait staff were friendly.

Overall, I would have given this place 3 stars if it hadn't been for the patronizing attitude from the one lady."}
{"text":"Love the thai ice tea here! You can also find the best drunken noodles with fried tofu here."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in the east valley! I've had lunch and dinner there a number of times and both experiences have been great. The number of times I've been there for lunch it was packed. Lunch seems to be the better deal. You get more for the money. Dinner is more expensive and it seems like you get a little less. I think it's because the lunch specials come with a spring roll, soup, and salad. (Soup and salad is all you can eat....as long as they don't run out.) Other Thai restaurants I've eaten at skimp on the meat. Not Yupha's. It's not like they pile on the meat, but you can actually find meat. The Thai dishes are amazing and fairly authentic. Be forewarned that if you order dishes extra hot, you'll not be able to taste anything else after the first dish. The servers are very friendly and provide good service. The place is kept very clean and looks more upscale for a non franchise Asian restaurant. The restaurant is a good size."}
{"text":"Yupha's is located in the same plaza as Vincitorio's Restaurant on the Southeast corner of McClintock and Elliot. They used to be located on Rural and Elliot, but have moved to this new location in the past year. The space is big, open and modern; with high ceilings, minimal furniture and modern art, it makes for a very relaxing vibe. We arrived at 6:30 on a Thursday night, and while the place wasn't completely full, most of the tables were occupied. Our waitress came by and took our beverage order, and then gave us some time to look over the menu. And time she gave us, because it seemed like it was 10 minutes before she finally returned; they must have been understaffed that night, because it was just her and one other waitress covering the whole restaurant, so we decided not to get to upset by this.

When she finally did return to take our order, she couldn't have been more pleasant; answering our random questions and suggesting items on the menu. We got the Thai Rolls and some Tom Kha Gai to start.. The rolls were cooked to a nice, golden, crunchy brown, but they were seriously lacking in the veggie department. The plum sauce was good, but they are probably not something that I would recommend for anyone to order.

I absolutely love Tom Kha Gai soup, but almost every Thai restaurant that I go to doesn't offer just a single serving bowl of it, they get all fancy and serve it in these giant silver urns, so I rarely end up ordering it. When I saw that I was able to order just a bowl of the soup, I knew that I had to give this version a try. Well, I have to say, this was the best version I have ever had; it had a touch of heat, mixed with the cool coconut and lime leaves, it was heavenly. My sister had never tried this kind of soup, so I scooped some into a bowl for her and she too thought that it was really good. The flavors were so well balanced, that I really could have eaten a giant urn full of this version!

I got the Pad Thai as my main dish....it was AMAZING!!!  The best pad thai I have had to date; sweet and spicy and just all around great.  I was impressed by how un-greasy it was, my only disappointment with it was that it came with just 2 shrimp!

My sister got the roasted duck, which she loved, they gave her the whole duck!  Our friends ordered the beef green curry, extra hot, and thought that is was good too.

Other than the spotty service, which I am chalking up to a bad night, and the skimpy Thai Rolls....Yupha's is my new favorite Thai place!  I just wish that I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Mama Yupha's Thai Kitchen definitely has the best fried rice I've ever had!  Their uniquely flavored Basil Fried Rice is the reason I've been back countless times & I live 25 miles away.  Talking with the waitress who is from Thailand, I learned that all their chef's are from Thailand, as well.  The restaurant is always fresh & clean, with their combination of spices tasting delicious; their service always quick & friendly.  Their combinations of flavors are amazing in all of their appetizers & dishes I've had & shared!"}
{"text":"Started off with the kanom jeeb I can describe it best like a crab cake egg roll. Next the Tom kai with chicken was similar to Panang curry in soup form with lemongrass and cilantro flavors.  Very delicious. One of us got drunken noodles.  It was sweet and spicy \"it was good.\"   I had the Panang chicken and I'm pretty certain that if I was on death row I would order this as a last meal.  Large extra rice.   For dessert we tried ordering the sticky rice with mangoes and they were out.   Not \"cool.\" So we ordered the flaming ice cream its like tempura fried ice cream with fire and rum.  It was probably the least tasty item of the night."}
{"text":"I Usually Get The \"Thai Fried Rice\" It's Very Good. This Time  I Got The \"Pad Thai\" Another Great Dish. I Will Go Back Here Soon. Been To A Few Different  Thai Restaurants And This Is One One The Best In The Area."}
{"text":"We were in from San Diego and all 5 of us really enjoyed our food. The portion sizes were large enough we could have shared. The service was excellent. If we're in Tempe again I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"OK, I have been all over Asia, and love all the different foods from Korea (Yes Kimchee is the bomb), to PHO, Mongolian and any form of Chinese even Sushi is a major part of my diet.  However I have never eaten at a \"Real\" Thai restaurant till today.  I had the Salad with spicy Peanut Dressing (Awesome) it all you can eat, and the Drunken you talk about Tasty.  I do like spice and this place has plenty; but it's the good flavorful spice that makes Thai food great.

I plan to try more Thai places in the near future, but they have to live up to the high Standards I had today at Yupha's Thai Kitchen"}
{"text":"Love Yupha's for both lunch and dinner.  The service is friendly.  Lunch is fabulous as you get the soup and salad that you can prepare how you want, with their really good warm peanut sauce along with whatever entree you order.  Every dish I have ever ordered there is wonderful.   I drive a little farther at lunch to go to Yupha's as it is my favorite Thai place in the East Valley."}
{"text":"The new location passes the smell test!  We had the red curry chicken and the chicken pad thai.  I really liked the consistency, flavor and spiciness of both of the dishes.  They could have been a little more generous with the chicken and shrimp.  

The bathroom is nice and clean.

I like the new location and I like the decorations.  However, they need to break the space up a little bit with some divider walls or hanging dividers and lights that come down from the ceilings on the tables.  It is a little too much like a big open auditorium.  

The service was fabulous!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Yupha's for more than 15 years and have never been disappointed. 

Most recently I had Yupha cater a lunch at the office for 60 people. The food, which was very plentiful, was loved by all. Just as good as eating in the restaurant. 

I highly recommend this place as the beat Thai food around!"}
{"text":"Great spot to stop for lunch and dinner. I ordered the Pad See Ew (#L118) and it was delicious! The dish came out quickly and tasted perfrctly fresh. Would deffinantly come again!"}
{"text":"Yesterday, 08/15/2015, was our first time here.  This is an absolutely excellent venue!  The food was fresh, creative, full of different flavors, and delicious!

The service was outstanding!  The staff coordinates to help each other.  We were served by no less that five different people at various times throughout the meal, all of whom had big smiles!  After items have been delivered, they check on you, but do not smother you.

A smiling staff is impressive and very important to us!  We will return many times!"}
{"text":"I've had this food twice, once in restaurant, once take out. The first time I got garlic noodles, and while they were good, it just wasn't flavorful enough. Plus, over half the items on the plate were not meant to be eaten, just for decoration. Looks like a lot of food, but it really isn't. Maybe I was just really hungry.
The staff sucked. I've heard from numerous other people (who love and still frequent this place, despite their staff) that Yupha's has the best food, just horrible service when the owner, Yupha, isn't there. It took forever to be seated, when we (party of two) could see actual tables open just sitting there. 

Second visit was a complete and utter disaster. I thought, oh, I'll try take out since I'm by my self and everyone says that's the way to do it anyway. I ordered the Pad Thai for dinner, not realizing that I was looking at the lunch menu. Who would think their lunch pad thai and their dinner pad thai would be different? Well, they are. I'm a vegetarian, and the lunch pad thai has tofu, no meat. Well, the dinner pad thai that I paid $13 for and got home with, had chicken and shrimp in it. I called to see if they could cook me a new meal if I came back (which was already irritating considering I live 15 minutes away. 15 minutes there, 15 minutes waiting, 15 minutes home, 15 minutes back, 15 minutes waiting,15 minutes home... This better be the best pad thai I've ever had.) But instead, after explaining the situation, the lady copped a major attitude with me and said, \"Ok, so?\" I explained again: I'm a vegetarian, I don't eat meat. What I have here has meat, so I can't eat it.\" Her reply: \"Yeah, we have options without meat. And?\" 

I cried. I paid $17 dollars after everything was said and done for something I couldn't eat. I will take my business somewhere that understands what good customer service is.

By the way: I've worked 3 years in the restaurant business and the last year I have been in retail, so I have extensive customer service experience. You should NEVER treat someone like that."}
{"text":"appetizer: we had the sampler - just couldn't resist! the best part was the golden curry puffs, so if you don't want a ginormous appetizer (which this is for 2 people), i would go for that. light, crunch, and good curry filling.

ped gang daeng: crispy roast duck. i LOVED this. the roast duck was crispy and not too oily. meat could have been a little more tender but it was close to perfection. on par with the roast duck i've had at chinese restaurants, with the added bonus of being served on top of a delicious curry. definitely recommend this dish.

pink diamond: salmon in panang curry. this dish was solid but not as good as the duck. my boyfriend really liked it, but i felt like salmon didn't really go that well with this kind of curry. still very good though.

what i like about this thai restaurant is that the menu actually has things beyond the typical pad thai / drunken noodles / blah blah. there are a lot of seafood dishes for a thai restaurant in phoenix, can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"This was an amazing dinner! We usually do not go for Thai food because it's just not our favorite. However, every dish was amazing! Will definitely be ordering from here more often!"}
{"text":"Wow - the food was awesome! It was super busy during lunch time and the servers did the best that they could with non-stop people coming through the door. I highly recommend this place! It is definitely my new favorite Thai place."}
{"text":"Yummy,yummy for the tummy! Great fresh Thai cuisine. The penang curry with beef is to die for along with drunken noodles and of course pad Thai with chicken. Also...try Yupah's fried rice..OMG so good. The owner is a sweet woman who works her tail off. She appreciates the locals and wants you to have a great dining experience.
Clean, clean restaurant too. You have to try this place, worlds apart from normal AZ Thai. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Delish! I went here on a date with my boyfriend and fell in love with the place. The ambiance is sheik and laid back, the service was quick and attentive, and the food was fresh and flavorful. It was his first time having Thai food and he couldn't get enough. The sliced papaya salad was so fresh and flavorful and a great starter on a warm day. The Pad Prew Wan was fresh and full of flavor also. I will most definitely be back and highly recommend trying it out. Great for a date or with family and friends.
Has a great selection for vegetarians also."}
{"text":"Food was good not much spice. My son and I both like spice and we ordered I number below hot and neither one was spicy. I had the green curry the taste was good but I would of preferred some spice. My son had the drunken noodles as everyone was raving he normally always has pad thai and he wishes he would of stick to his normal. The unlimited salad bar was very good. The one down fall my food came out 5 minutes before his. When you order together you should be served together I think the waitress grabbed his and have to the gentlemen that set across from us."}
{"text":"I love this place, I've eaten at a few Thai places in the valley and none so far come close to being as good as Yuphas.  I go at lunch so I can get the salad with the amazingly good peanut sauce. My favorite dish is the pad see ew, but the pad thai, drunken noodle and fried rice are also really good.  The staff are also really friendly."}
{"text":"The place was empty and there were a lot of servers, nonetheless, service was slow and inattentive. The prices are good but food isn't that great. Similar priced places have food that is a lot better. Food was mediocre and thai rolls were not good. Not many items to choose from on the menu either."}
{"text":"Elegant, upscale and modern decor. Classical music. Friendly, helpful and super fast waitresses. We had: Pad prew wan, medium hot, it was delicious, nice balance of sweet and sour; Pad prik khing, sauce was nice texture and balance of spices was best I've had; Homemade coconut ice cream had a light flavor perfect to cleanse the pallet and had a sorbet texture. Brown rice was too dry. I can't wait to try their noodles!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here!!! Everything here is great but my favorite seems to be their fried rice and their spring rolls!! The only reason I gave them 4 stars and not 5 is due to the service. Sometimes it can be a while before you get heckled in on and your drinks can be empty. But they are very friendly and their food makes up for the slow service."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Yupha's for years! I used to live right down the street and took it for granted and crave it all the time! Best thai food around!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying food here is very yummy! I have tried the Chicken Satay, Drunken Noodles with Chicken(medium spice level), Veggie Spring Rolls. Veggie Platter. Everything was super delicious. Having said that the customer service needs some serious improvements. We had gone there as a big group from work and the service we received was very annoying. I wish they were more courteous. I really wanted to give 5 stars for food but service got it down to 3."}
{"text":"The red curry is good not great..Good price and good service. I recommend coming during dinner time for more options."}
{"text":"Love this place! Go here all the time and always get Red Curry, Drunken Noodles, or Yupha's Fried Rice- YUM! Everyone is so incredibly nice and the food is always delicious. Is it bad that they know my name, work schedule, friends, and family now?! Love you Yupha's!"}
{"text":"We went on a very busy Saturday night and waited 20 minutes for a seat.
We ordered an appetizer, and 3 entrees spicy \"Hot\". Each is reviewed below:

Sampler $14.00 
Thai roll (2), Golden curry puff (2), Satay (2), & Kew Krob (6), served with plum sauce, peanut sauce & cucumber salad.

Everything was deep fried besides kabob/chicken. The chicken was cold and tasted like it had Feta cheese on it :(

Drunken Noodles* with Beef
Sautéed flat noodles with Napa cabbage, tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, egg, Thai basil & chili pepper.

This was our favorite dish. Spicy and flavorful.

Gaeng Kua Sapparod**with Shrimp
\"Red curry sauce, coconut milk, pineapple & kaffir lime leaves.

This did not taste right- like the kitchen ran out of sauce and they just added coconut milk to make it go further. The flavor was totally off. It was also not spicy at all.

Pad Thai with Chicken
Sautéed rice noodles with egg, sweet pickled radish, scallion, bean sprouts & ground peanuts.

The dish had no flavor. We had to ask for a lime to ad (usually comes with lime at other Thai restaurants) Very disappointed. Also NOT spicy like we ordered.

The service was slow and disappointing. The place was packed when we got there and I mean so packed it was hard to get to our table and hard for our severs to get around. We wanted to order dessert but nobody asked and we waited FOREVER to get our check.

I would return only after checking out the other Thai restaurants in the area first for comparison."}
{"text":"Love this place, the pad Thai and Pad Sa Ew are both amazing!! Great lunch specials with salad bar and soup. Always friendly service."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great Thai food in the Tempe area, look no further. It's on the small side, but not uncomfortable, and the service has always been prompt and courteous.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place based on the number of positive reviews and my desire to eat endless amounts of thai food.  Unfortunately, after going here on 3 separate occasions we kept getting consistently subpar food. Our appetizers (the sampler) were cold. I ordered the Lard Na, the Pad See-ew, and the Pad Thai with chicken (ordered at medium hot).  All were really sweet with no degree of heat. Even my girlfriend, who has little tolerance for spicy food thought it was too sweet. The servers were nice. We're moving on to a different place."}
{"text":"Let's face it: this is the best Thai place in the valley.

This is where I take my wife for anniversaries. We love it!

The restaurant is open, so even though it gets a bit busy, it isn't stifling. Waitors are responsive too.

Lettuce wraps are a great appetizer, but they aren't going to fill you up.

Best thing in the menu is the Drunken Noodles. The Garlic Chicken is made with a sauce that is drinkable good. The Phad Thai is solid and you can get it as spicy as you can stand it or as mild as you'd like. The spice is fantastic if you can stand it.

Yupha's isn't cheap and is nearly always busy. But for good Thai, there's few places that compare.

 I give it 4 stars because it is a bit spendy."}
{"text":"Yupha's is the best Thai I've ever had.  The food is delicious, portions are decent, and spice is well controlled (from mild to triple Thai hot).

Lunch is busy and crowded, and service may be a bit slow. The food always makes up for it."}
{"text":"Notice all the five star reviews?  Yea, one of the best in town by far!  I always get the red or yellow curry.  Been eating here for a few years now.  Yupha is great and she kinda looks like Kim Jong Il in Team America, which is one of my fav movies! If your lady likes spicy/Thai food, Yupha's is probably going to be a panty dropper for ya because the food is great and the atmosphere is very ambient and sexy."}
{"text":"We had an outstanding dinner at Yupha's Thai Kitchen. The interior is modest and tasteful, but very nice for its location in a strip mall. For an appetizer, we shared a Golden Curry Puff which had a pastry crust that was a perfect combination of golden crispy and tender and flaky. Two in our party ordered the Yupha's Seafood #803. The presentation of the Yupha's Seafood dish was an unexpected surprise, with the seafood wrapped in a foil peacock. Luckily, the food inside lived up to the presentation. I had the Green Curry (#401) with seafood which was perfectly medium-hot. There were large pieces of shrimp, calamari and mussels. Another member of our party tried the Himalai (#800) and said that it was excellent. I sampled small amounts of all the dishes and the ingredients tasted fresh and the seasoning was delicious. For dessert we shared the flaming-ice-cream which had generous quantities of rum and the homemade coconut ice cream over sticky rice. Both were delicious and a perfect conclusion to our meal. I also had their French press coffee which was served in a French-themed mug which was a charming touch. I'm eager to see if a return visit will as satisfying."}
{"text":"Probably the best yellow curry I've ever eaten!  Their Pad Thai is my wife's favorite.  The staff is friendly & quick, and the decor seems 'authentic' to the style."}
{"text":"Business hours indicate they close at 9pm; at 8:45 the hostess started badgering and rushing us to basically hurry up and finish. At 8:55 they flashed the lights on and off so that patrons \"get the hint\" to leave. At 9:05 they basically escort you out the door. Foodwise,I had the Yupha's seafood feast and it was horrible. Will never return."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to eat. I've taken several coworkers and they too have come back for more. They have a fantastic lunch menu which includes soup and salad.  The peanut salad dressing was an unusual taste for me at first but now I can't get enough of it.  The Red Curry soup with egg plant and shrimp is delicious as is the lad na.  Don't forget desert!! Their coconut ice cream and sweet sticky rice combo is the bomb! Gets busy pretty fast.  If you don't get there before noon you'll find urself waiting in line."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places in Phoenix, their Yupha's fried rice is just too good! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really bomb Thai food! Much better than Thai basil and possibly the best Thai food near ASU. The atmosphere inside is really cool too!"}
{"text":"Yupha's Thai Kitchen is the best Thai food in the valley.  I am married to a Thai who likes to cook and we both agree on this."}
{"text":"After reading so many good reviews i am thinking if that was bad day when i visited Yupa ?

Lunch Soup was pathetic with nut sauce.
I ordered Red Curry with Rice, taste was OK and my friends were also of the same opinion and they ordered different things like Noodles, Fried Rice, some curry with Rice. Service was also poor took lot hell of time to place order and then get order.

My review is 2 star compared to other Thai restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here last night.  The restaurant is clean and has a nice atmosphere. The host and server were both friendly and helpful. My boyfriend ordered curry with shrimp and I ordered a noodle dish. Both dishes came out really quickly and were delicious. I would recommend getting any curry.  Overall our experience was great and I would and plan on coming back again."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful business lunch here yesterday - the Pad Thai noodles were delicious.  Will have to visit again!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for last 2 years and the food has been consistently good. I have had Thai food at many places but this one beats everyone by far. I am a big fan of all the curries, pad thai and their coconut ice cream. This place is highly recommended, if you are looking for some flavorful food.   

Overall, a great place for scrumptious food with a great service."}
{"text":"Drunken noodles and a salad/soup bar? Best lunch ever. I dream of this place on lazy Wednesdays at the office. The flavors are consistent, food is fresh and they dont seem to slack on their quality if there is a rush."}
{"text":"I've been working my way through Yupha's menu for a couple months now, EVERYTHING that I've tried has been awesome no exceptions.  So why just 3 stars? 

You could call the service efficient or minimal but I've never seen my waitress more than once during a meal.  Order everything you want right up front, you won't get another chance before the hostess drops off the check."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. It's fresh and tastes great. I would give it 4 stars. 

The service; however, was not great. We got there with a group of 7 for lunch and the wait was 45 minutes! We ordered our food with appetizers and waited another 35 minutes for our food. We kept having to ask the server for more water. 

The wait here is normally longer for lunch since it's so busy so just be prepared for that."}
{"text":"Yummy Thai food! A little expensive for what you get, but I'd still go back for more :)"}
{"text":"Food here is high quality, genuine Thai and generally fantastic. The staff was awesome. I had a vegetable dish (Thai Spicy with Shrimp) and it set me free, had to ask for more napkins. Lol. Good atmosphere. A must try."}
{"text":"Fresh food, great service, reasonable prices  Love the Pad Thai!  Not a fan of the yellow and black sign at the door welcoming me to the restaurant.  I\"ve been in five times in the past two months, and felt uneasy each time.  Is there a problem about which I should be concerned while I'm eating?"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in the valley! Great food and prices, I also really love the overall atmosphere and decorations. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is best place for Thai in the east valley. Every once and a while the consistency is off, however, I am Thai and I recommend this place to everyone. They have atypical dishes like Thai beef jerky and sticky rice. End it well with coconut ice cream or sticky rice. Go there, you won't regret it. This place is well managed and there is good service!"}
{"text":"I have had good thai experiences...and especially bad thai experiences...but when my friend brought me to Yupha's I was nothing but impressed! I have such a hard time finding good thai food that is gluten free and they were SO accommodating and knowledgeable about what was gluten free and what wasn't and the Pad See Ew was delicious!! The only thing that makes me sad is that they aren't open all day long and it seems like every time I really have a craving they're closed for their lunch break.  

If you're craving thai give this place a shot. The inside of the restaurant is pretty cool too. Really laid back and comfortable!"}
{"text":"I have traveled across the internet to sing the praises of a certain Thai restaurant. Through a semester and a half of research with one of my favorite ASU professors, we had dined at Yupha's Thai Kitchen once. It was incredible! One of the best Thai meals I've ever had was overshadowed by some service faux pas and thus they lost a star in my book... but the food (!) oh the food... 

We began our meal with a sampler platter, it was a big plate of deep fried beige. Normally, this would repulse me and wish for some creativity, but I gave it a go before I started my ranting and it was SO good! the thai rolls are your basic deep fried spring rolls, at least the ingredients were fresh. but the plum sauce was great and it went well with the fried dumplings and I always enjoy fried tofu!

I ordered #850 the Lard Na. Thick noodles in a gravy with veggies. I was happy with it. I ordered it to be cooked at medium heat with a chili tray. Our server was very happy to accommodate me. :) But the highlight of the meal was my friend's meal. He ordered #812 Thai Beef Jerky. It was a nice hunk of beef that was marinated and then deep fried and served with sticky rice and a nice dipping sauce. It was crispy, tender, flavorful with a combination of spices I never really had before. I loved every bite I stole from my friend. The sticky rice went perfectly with it. It was served on this leaf atop a plate and the leaf perfumed the rice. It was a perfect dish. I *need* you to give it a try also!! 

We capped off our meal with the Fried Banana & I cream. An Americanized Thai classic done right. I could have used a lil LESS honey in all honesty but that's just me. 

Now for the bad news...

Everyone at the table got their food except for me. It took another 20 minutes for me to get my Lard Na. *harsh sigh* really?? I know Thai places usually serve food as its ready and not necessarily when the table's orders are all completed. But 20 minutes! Come on! AAAAND... the worst food crime didn't even happen at my table: at a table near me, a dish of hot food, pineapple fried rice maybe and the guests were a little bewildered at its sight but still began to eat it. They used the serving utensils and dished some of it out, one of them put the utensil in their mouth and began using instead of a fork or chopsticks (something I do sometimes too) . They laughed about getting free food... at the same time, another table got their food and same thing... one person was left out. **harsher sigh** and THEN the server realized what she had done, she gave the dish to the wrong table. So in what I consider to be very gross more than anything. The server grabbed the rice dish and its utensil that was sitting next to the dish on the table  from the table it was delivered to and brought it to the table it was supposed to go to. half eaten, with an obvious dent in it. Before the guest could say something, the server re-fluffed the rice and left the table. **shudder**

To My Fellow Yelpers: That's gross. And yet I stand by my 4 star review. The food's THAT good! But when you go, be sure to keep an eye on the servers. Just to be safe and speak up when your server serves you a half eaten dish."}
{"text":"I love Thai food, so when Yuphas relocated closer to my house, I had to try it.

The place was full of people right around lunchtime. We got a table quickly though. The food was fresh and flavorful, albeit rather uninspired. I had the pad thai and my husband had one of the chicken lunch specials. There was about a 30 minute wait for the dishes, which was not too bad considering how many people were in the restaurant. The salad and soup do-it-yourself bar was a pleasant surprise, and we helped ourselves to many bowls of soup while we waited.

The presentation of the food at Yuphas is really beautiful, and the portions are notably large as well. All in all, a great place to go if you're craving Thai and happen to be in the area. I may have to go back to try some other things on their menu.

One thing that did bother me, however, was how close together the tables are. It made it rather awkward at times."}
{"text":"We had a great meal at Yupha's Thai Kitchen.  The food was delicious and the staff was very friendly.  Our waitress went out of her way to make sure the experience was fun and she had great recommendations.  I will be back the next time I visit AZ to Mountain Bike."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants in metro Phoenix area.  Our staple menu: pad Thai, panama curry and Tom yum ..... Yum!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I have had outside of Thailand. I have been here now a few times and as I sit here on my lunch break eating leftovers I decided to take a look at the reviews and write my own.

I see a few common complaints in the reviews that I would like to address. The first is the price for the amount. I will agree that the price here is a bit higher than most of the other places to get Thai food I have encountered, and I have gone to many a Thai food place. That said, the few extra dollars a plate is largely offset in my books by how great the food is. I have seen some people say that the portions are less then they expect and I have not experienced that at all.

Another thing that I would mention in regards to the price is the atmosphere. When encountering Thai kitchens I have found it is pretty hit or miss how nice they are on the inside. Several places I have been to I would only ever order take out from rather than sitting in the rundown or dirty restaurant with less than ideal service. Yupha's is where I go when I want to sit down and have a nice meal with someone. It is clean and nice inside, I took my mother to try Thai food this week here.

I have also had only excellent service the times I have been to Yupha's. Very knowledgeable and friendly servers that have never been short or rude."}
{"text":"Tried to come check this restaurant out given all the good reviews on their food. However, NOT a fan that while their hours say they are open until 3, they have their \"closed\" sign up and won't seat you at 2:40. (So those Google reviews are spot on regarding complaints about their closing time & customer service handling that.) They didn't even offer carry out. A suggestion--if you won't seat people & aren't really open until the time stated on your website (& door), you should put that caveat on your website! A simple, \"Note:  we do not seat new tables after 2:30pm,\" or something similar would be very helpful to your potential customers. Not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love Love Love Yuphas! Delicious food, reasonable prices and super quick! i get take out from here every few weeks and I've always enjoyed every bite! It's somewhat addicting..."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Thai restaurant. It's almost always excellent and the staff are friendly and nice. Their yellow curry is fantastic and the pad thai is great. The only change I usually make when ordering is asking for less fish sauce - which they are great about changing for me!"}
{"text":"Go here!  Everything was good, drunken noodles were fantastic.  Great atmosphere; polite, quick service.  Wish it was just around the corner from me."}
{"text":"It is conveniently located next to the movie theaters. The food was excellent and properly seasoned and well presented. Restaurant decor is very nice. The service was prompt but we arrived as they were opening."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place ever!! I've been to Thailand and when I want to \"go back there\" I just eat at Yupha's. The Yupha's fried rice is so good it is just plain ridiculous. I would strongly recommend the sticky rice and mango for dessert."}
{"text":"Yummy goodness!!!! We were seated promptly on a busy Friday night and the server greeted us warmly. I had the Papaya Salad hot and it was so delicious--I like to get HOT not Thai Hot, but 'hot' so that I can feel all the flavors tingle my lips.  We also ordered the drunken noodles and they were OK with substituting out bell pepper for broccoli.  And my friend ordered a soup with a soothing coconut base, just delicious!  

I am a fan!!

I do not live in Phoenix, but I will be sure to frequent this restaurant when I am back in the Valley of the Sun for super yummy Thai food!!  Thank you!! :)"}
{"text":"Delicious.  It's the best Thai food I've ever had in Arizona.  But, living in Tucson, I've only been to a few places there, and this is much much better.  Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Three times is not a charm, between dinner and lunches... it's ok and I'll keep chugging over here if someone is asking to go... but nothing memorable... I've been across the menu from duck to seafood to noodle dishes and curry.  

If you like hot and spicy, they will go the mile and this place will be for you!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places in Chandler. Heat is on the mild side so don't be afraid to order a little higher than you might normally at somewhere like Thai Rama."}
{"text":"There is no 'hate' button in here otherwise I would press that along with zero star. Food was really bad. Everythig we ordered was extremely sour and our teeths are still squeaky. Spent almost $40 and didnt even have couple of bites and left the restuarant. Will never go again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Thai places in the valley. I'm so happy its close to my work.  All the dishes I've had have been amazing. I especially love their calamari. Its strips not rings and very tender and delicious!!"}
{"text":"Very good.   My favorite Thai food in the eat valley.  Good service but can get busy.   That's a good sign for me."}
{"text":"We ate here about two weeks ago with another couple. My husband and I both enjoyed the atmosphere and the service was excellent. I ordered one of their curry dishes as \"mild\" and it came extremely hot. I usually do well with spicy food, but this dish was way past \"eye-watering\"."}
{"text":"I just love this place!  I had never had Thai before trying this little gem out.  I have been to serveral other Thai places and nothing compares.  The staff is great, the Thai tea is delicious, and this place has the best coconut ice cream w/sticky rice I have EVER had.  Food is fabulous, give it a try you won't be disappointed =)"}
{"text":"I keep coming back ... the allure of their pineapple curry gets me every time. Charming atmosphere and pleasant, attentive wait staff make dining here a pleasure"}
{"text":"This place was so great! Came here for my birthday, there was about 20 of us, and everyone absolutely loved their food! The ambience is so cute, waiters are great, and the food came out quick and fresh. I tried a bit of everyone's and it was great. If you love good thai food this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch!  I am usually pushed for time on projects, so I wans't sure if I wanted to go to a sit down, but this place was nice and quick.  The lunch offers salad and soup with an entry ($8).  I thought that the salad and the soup was weak.  However, the pad thai and the drunken noodles made up for it.  My coworkers got their dishes mild and hot.  I got my noodles extra hot.  And of course, being a Thai restaurant, had another standard of spiciness.  

The dish provided enough food for lunch.  People were friendly and cashed us out in a timely manner.  Definitely recommend it if you want to switch it up for lunch between Jimmy Johns, Subway, and the AZ Bread Company."}
{"text":"I love to come in and get my fix for some yummy Thai food.  One of my favorite dishes to get here is the Drunken Noodles, and it has to be one of the more spicy dishes on the menu.  I also really like the red curry dishes.  I've tried so many things on the menu, and have liked everything."}
{"text":"Lost 2 stars!  Sat in the restaurant for 15 minutes ... no waitress ... no water ... no nothing.  We left.

Sad part was there was people who left, then came back and got service before us.  The guy who came in after us got seated, hot tea and his order taken while we just sat and waited.  SERIOUSLY doubt we will be going back now.  If you have an hour or so to kill, you can wait for your food/service in there."}
{"text":"7 patrons.   First 2 entrees came fairly quickly .  A 3 minute wait for the following 4 entrees.  The last entree (duck) came almost 10 minutes later and on an icy cold plate.  The sauce on plate which was almost pure soy sauce congealed quickly.   Chrispy chicken rated highly.  Rice and noodles dishes above par. Fish mediocre.   Duck rating quite low.   On a positive note the chocolate lava cake was superb and well worth a stop after a movie. Service was barely existent. As we were paying our bill there was some substance in the air that had all of us and those around us coughing and tearing up.  Owner propped open the door."}
{"text":"Came here last weekend for my friend's bday dinner.  Beautiful space (1 star just for that).  The bday girl thought Shrimp Pad Thai was just ok, my pineapple fried rice was ok, but my other friend thought the Thai BBQ chicken dish was dry.  No one liked their sticky rice, it was hard & sticky,lol.  Overall, an ok experience.  In my opinion, nothing beats my Thai Spices :)"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Phoenix metro. We love coming to Yupha's for our date night. Excellent food and great service!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times in the past couple of months and the food was great, reasonably priced, and well seasoned.  Be careful with the spicy rating, go to the more conservative, when they say spicy they mean it!!  Service was okay hard to get refills and the check.  Will continue to return when I'm in the mood for Thai.  Hmmmm maybe tonight??"}
{"text":"Tom ka gai soup with vegetables is a delicious comfort food for Friday evening.   As always the place was hopping be we were sat after only a short wait and service was incredibly fast for how busy they were.  I can't say enough about the exceptional service and food at Yuphas.  It keeps us coming back for more."}
{"text":"This place is always great. Our favorites are the Thai spring rolls, chicken pad see ew, and chicken pad soon sen. The best dessert is their sticky rice with coconut ice cream. We are definately regulars."}
{"text":"I think this has to be the best Thai in town! They have so many dishes that can only be found on their menu like Thai Jerky and Duck 4-5 different ways that one must go back... but even then it's hard because you probably have a favorite dish that you just can't help but order everytime because it's the best you've ever had... what dish you ask?

Well... for me, it's their Pad Seew. Pure Heaven on a plate... the perfect balance of flavor, and the noodles are so fresh! I'm so thankful my friend had the obsession before me and shared it with me so now I am in the same boat. It is Freakin' Awesome (My highest foodie approval rating).

As for the lunch buffet... well, while the vegetable soup and salad is a nice extra, I find it completely unnecessary. The soup is more broth and the I prefer other thai restaurant peanut dressing to theirs... just my humble opinion. Besides, their lunch serving portion is the same size as an entree at dinnertime and filling enough for a second meal.

I only have one note of caution: For those afraid of spice, be forewarned... I think when they ask you what spice level you'd like your meal at, you must say: None... because even mild has a warmer kick than usual. I come from the world of Mild, but have worked on my spice level so I can handle their mild quite well... but for the unspiceables, you've been cautioned! Those who like it Spicy hot... this is the Thai place is for YOU! Ask for Thai Spicy for more heat!

Yupha, I'm so glad your restaurant is in Metro Phoenix and I hope you keep serving up your brand of Pad Seew for years and years to come!"}
{"text":"Nice ambient and clean restaurant. Friendly service. However, the price is ridiculous. Ordered a Thai Boat noodle and it cost $13. Normal price at other restaurants ranges between $8.50-$10. They don't even have meatball or vegetables (celery, string beans, etc) like traditional Thai Boat noodle would include. Also, they barely give you any bean sprouts. Beware on asking for more because they will charge you $1 for a side of bean sprouts. I can get an entire bag at the grocery store for $1. Never will I come here again for their Thai boat noodle. 

On a better note, they do have a good and affordable lunch special. I give them credit on that but not the other stuff on their menu."}
{"text":"Wonderful!!!! Loved it!! Awesome soup & salad bar too! Very generous portions, definitely got a lot for your money... Would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Based on the number of 4 and 5 star reviews, I felt that I absolutely had to try this place.  Since switching jobs, now working in the Tempe area I've been on a Thai and Pho binge.  The second Thai restaurant I've tried in Tempe was Yupha's Thai Kitchen.  I decided to dine in.  After being seated, I sat alone for about 13 minutes before the server came to take my order.  I ordered Veggie Drunken Noodles.  She said help yourself to the salad and soup bar.  I did!

I was about 2 spoons in with my soup and my food came out.  It was SUPER quick!  While the server was putting my plate down I got a strong whiff of a fish smell.  He said enjoy and walked off.  I finished my soup and salad and took just one forkful of drunken noodles.  It was disgusting!  Gross!  It tasted like soggy noodles cooked in a pan with fish.  My server never came back.  I got the attention of a hostess, explained why I didn't like my meal and told her I'll just stick with the soul and salad. She explained the price difference in just ordering the soup and salad bar ($8) and a chicken meal ($9.50).  She was right so I decided to try something else.  I asked for a few suggestions.
She informed me that the Drunken Noodles are cooked with Thai Basil.  The Thai Basil cause that it's cooked in is fish based.  Who would have thought that?!  The items on the menu that is made with Oyster Sauce or Oyster Oil is indicated on the menu with parenthesis.  I think there should be some sort of indication of the fish content in ALL items, even those with Thai Basil.  

I also think when the hostess seats you, they should tell you to help yourself to the soup and salad bar.  Or, the person that brings the water should say something.  Waiting almost 15 minute for the server to take your order and tell you to go to the soup/salad bar is far too long.  I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"This place is great. Definitely recommend the chicken pad thai. If you like it spicy I'd recommend getting the triple Thai hot. You get a lot of food for what you pay. I'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great food with fast service. Food spice was not as spicy & I had expected, hot spicy was about low spicy."}
{"text":"AMAZINGGGGGGG!!!!!!  The food is amazing! Just a delicious spot to grab lunch (they have specials and are quick for a lunch time bite) or go for dinner! 

OMG the food is delicious and they understand spice -- medium is actually medium -- \"thai hot\" is actually \"thai hot\" -- the food is just phenomenal!

The staff is friendly but can be flighty and a bit lost at the wheel at times so don't let that bother you -- go for the pad thai or curry !!!! Delish!!! T

If you got for luck they include a salad and soup bar and OMG it's good!!! 

Try it -- you won't be sorry ;)"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food restaurants in town. The only thing keeping me from a 5 star review is the service during lunch can be a bit slow.

Don't get me wrong, they are super friendly, but clearly get overwhelmed by the lunch rush of people from local businesses. 

Putting that aside, the food is top notch, they make the best Pad Thai I've found in AZ, and if you're brave and get it Thai hot, the burn is so good, but doesn't mask the flavor!

The salad bar with the awesome peanut dressing is a big plus, and they make a tasty Thai iced tea as well. Great lunch spot if you work or live nearby!"}
{"text":"I go here all the time when I lived close by but since I moved I haven't been back, yesterday I ordered Togo the drunken noodles and it was terrible. The rice noodle tasted sour, like it was old. And I order crab puff and that threw me off, because I used to go here just for the crab puffs and it seems like it's not the same. They roll is differently now and the filling isn't as tasty as before 

Did they change owners? 
I don't think I'll be coming back. 

One star because the waiters are always nice whenever I come in."}
{"text":"The absolutely best Thai food that I have ever had. There is usually a wait during busy hours but it's so worth the wait! My boyfriend and I get the Pad Thai spicy & love the leftovers that we get to bring home after :) No other Thai place even compares."}
{"text":"After reading the other review, and trying this for myself I had to register to voice my opinion. - 1st review.

I had an excellent experience.  This is about my 20th Thai restaurant that I have dined at.  For people familiar with Phoenix Thai places, this is far better than Thai basil, swadhi Thai, and Thai-rama.  This is on par with Thai Thai in Scottsdale.  I ordered the Pad Gra Pow for lunch.  It was 6.95 and I received the traditional Thai start soup (which is seasoned broth with scallions and herbs).  The Pad Gra Pow came out very fast and had a heaping scoop of white rice.  The dish had fresh green bell pepper, red bell pepper, onion, and white meat chicken.  I usually order hot to thai-hot but when trying a new place I always go for the medium.  This dish surprised me with a nice kick from the Thai chili peppers that were in the sauce which was equally balanced with sweetness from the Thai King Basil.

I highly recommend this as I will be going back tomorrow since I enjoyed it that much.

*According to the website, the owner grows all the herbs used in the dish in a personal garden*"}
{"text":"Food was delicious.
Service was adequate. No complaints. 
Nice atmosphere. Tranquil and comfortable. 
Portions skimpy.
Prices seemed a little high for such small portions. 
If you go really hungry, plan on $pending some cash to be satisfied."}
{"text":"This place is good.  It's little high price, but it was good Thai food.  I wish the portion size was bigger."}
{"text":"I thought this place deserved an update. They have always served great food but before their service used to be really bad. Now this place has really changed, their service has been consistently good for the last 4 times we've eaten there while the food is as delicious as always. I'm very pleased with that and wanted to express my happiness. :)"}
{"text":"I'll make this brief since this place already has over 100 reviews.

Service: Excellent

Prices: On point (especially during lunch time)

Dining area: Charming

Food: Some of the best Thai food I have ever eaten.

Portions: Good size; I've never left hungry

Cons: Lunch service is ALWAYS super packed so be prepared to wait to be seated (nearly every seat will have a but in it!)."}
{"text":"I have been here now 3x and have gotten the Drunken Noodles every time!  They are delicious.  The portions are just right and the food is always fresh and hot!  The thai levels are 1-7 and aren't always accurate.  The thai tea here is a little too strong compared to others that I have had at other thai restaurants.  The lunch options are great which include a thai salad and soup.  They are quick and efficient so if you're on a lunch time crunch, you will make it without a worry.  They are super busy all of the time, so keep that in mind.  I would highly recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"There were two big reasons why I was SO impressed with Yupha's.

1) I came in while adhering to a very, very restrictive diet. No salt, no oil, no sugar. I ordered the seafood special and requested it cooked to my restrictions. Not only were they able to steam everything without those add ins (which I was amazed by - AND it tasted great which was a major plus!) but they even asked me if I wanted to sub out their jasmine rice for brown instead. It was awesome that they not only helped me keep my diet going, but even gave healthy alternatives that weren't on the menu.

2) I came in with a group of 25 people. Talk about a major task for a restaurant! They carried off our meal without a hitch, and - get this - gave us each separate checks without us requesting it. I've been with much smaller groups at other restaurants and had this turned down.

Overall, customer service was outstanding. Seriously blown away. I can only vouch so much for the food considering my diet, but I can say that with me taking out all of the most tasty ingredients, it still tasted REALLY great. Everyone's food around me looked phenomenal as well.

I will definitely be back... especially when I am off my diet!"}
{"text":"Awesome service...beautiful display of food. The bathroom was very nice as well. Must try Drunken Noodles with spice! And the fried banana dessert was to die for! Fan for life...Thank you Yupah...your service is excellent."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since my last update and I will have to move Yupha's up on the list of thai places in the valley.  Every time I have gone since my last review I have liked the food even more and more.  I mainly eat the noodle dishes and they are vastly different than all the other thai restaurants.  At first I wasn't sure it was a good thing, but they have really grown on me.  They all tend to be saucier than other versions, but I have really grown to like it.  I'm not sure which way they are supposed to be as I have never been to Thailand so I will say they are good and different.  The staff is here has actually been consistently nice and helpfully.  Today I went for lunch and they were packed ( I actually had left another thai restaurant that had forgotten they had sat me ) but I was seated promptly and my food came out incredibly fast.  I will definitely keep coming here for lunch.

Try:
- Iced Thai Coffee
- Pad Thai
- Pad See Ew
- Drunkin Noodles"}
{"text":"Oh Yupha's!! 
You are amazing at what you do!! Best Thai food Tempe/Chandler has to offer!!! 
If you step in for lunch, you'll find the lovely options of getting a homemade veggie soup, and warmed peanut dressing salad along with your entree!
My ultimate favorite dish here has to be the drunken noodles!! Trust me I have tried the drunken noodles at just about every good Thai place here in AZ, and this place makes the best!!
Only thing I suggest is making a reservation when having a group larger than 5!!"}
{"text":"The Panang Curry is one of those meals that feels like you are home; really a life affirming meal.  One of those meals that makes you feel refreshed and happy to be alive to enjoy such a thing.

The food comes quickly and you are always provided plenty of refreshment.  Really, this place is a wonderful thing.  The only sad fact is that there isn't enough rice to sop up every remaining ounce of curry.  

Seriously, I think I might ask for more rice next time."}
{"text":"omg what the heck did I do? I came here again by mistake. Ordered the Satay. That is noooo chicken. Again inedible. Well, they haven't gotten any better in 2 years. Jeez I knew this place looked familiar."}
{"text":"This place is authentic.  Who ever said they weren't sure does not know real good Mexican food. 

This is great food"}
{"text":"How I love this beautiful restaurant...

If you love curry, you must eat here.  Try the yellow curry.  By far, the best I've ever had and what my husband craves after growing up in Thailand.  The flavors are truly lovely and the heat is perfect.  Don't skip the appetizers - the sample plate serves up all the favorites and is always delicious.

Thai tea can be hit or miss - and expensive.  

Excellent service, every time.  Gorgeous decor and extremely clean.  We are forever customers :)"}
{"text":"The staple, baseline of pad thai here met my taste bud needs.  It was a little sweet, not too sweet and a little bit of savory.   Seems just right compared to other restaurants.  I had it with the chicken which was pretty good, not too dry."}
{"text":"Very authentic Thai restaurant. Definitely will be coming back. Their drunken noodle with seafood mix is delicious!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever !! Please don't go here ! This place doesn't maintain hygiene standards , we found a stapler pin inside Tofu !!! My friend realized it when the pin was in her mouth .. After this owner today even apologized and blamed it on the tofu itself .. One more weird thing in this restaurant is that you can't food here you would have to pay extra 2$ if you do so !!!! Servers are super rude .."}
{"text":"It was love at first sight and at first bite for me here at Yupha's.  I'd heard all great things for months, yet hadn't  had an opportunity to try it.  Oh, the anticipation!  The entire experience was well with my wait as the chic decor, outstanding customer service, and fabulous food exceeded my every expectation.  Warm, welcoming and patient staff assisted us as we asked 1000 questions about the 800-item menu and then ordered (coconut curry with chicken and drunken noodles).  The food was fresh, hot, and just as spicy as we wanted it (we ordered Thai hot and almost licked our plates clean!).  I've been home for three hours now and I'm still reliving this amazing culinary experience and I'm already planning my next visit.  So happy to meet my new friend, Yupha, and can't wait to see her again!  Ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at many different Thai restaurants and this is my favorite. I love their red curry."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a perfect Thai food restaurant for years and I have finally found it at Yupah's. I have tried countless Thai restaurants from Thai Rama to Latitude Eight to Thai basil and none of them compare to the food and atmosphere of Yupah's. 

The prices are standard to Thai but the food is out of this world! You can really taste every single flavor. I tried the tom Kai gai coconut soup and it is by far my favorite. The lemon grass and spices are amazing. Every flavor is present served amazingly. The service is incredible as well. Everyone is extremely friendly. The red curry is without a doubt the best food on the menu. I absolutely love it. 

Definitely go here. No other place compares! I love Yupah's!"}
{"text":"I really wish that I could give this restaurant a better review because the food was really good. For the food alone, I'd give this place 4 stars.

We saw many great reviews on yelp for this restaurant, so we decided to give it a try. It was pretty busy when we went in which was expected as it was a Friday night. We expected a wait but there was none & we were seated promptly. The waitress was completely in a hurry & seemed like she wanted us to order right away. Since we had never been to the restaurant, we were taking a look through the menu & trying to make a decision.

After a few moments, we decided to order the Drunken Noodles with Chicken, medium spice & the Pad Garlic Sauce with Chicken, medium plus spice. About 25 minutes after we had ordered, we finally got our order. No one checked on us during that time to let us know our food was coming or asked us if we wanted to order something while we waited as it was going to be a while. Considering how hungry we were, we definitely would've ordered an appetizer.

Like previously mentioned, the food was really good. The Drunken Noodles were full of flavor & the spice level was just right. The Pad Garlic Sauce was the same way. It came with a side of steamed mixed vegetables, which honestly, I wish they would've tossed them in the garlic sauce with the chicken but since it was a large bowl, I mixed together the rice & vegetables in it.

I've eaten at quite a few different Thai restaurants in the area & it seemed like the portion sizes at this restaurant were smaller than what they normally are. For the taste, I guess it could be argued that it was worth the cost ... Maybe.

After we had finished our meal, our waitress came back & dropped off the check. She didn't ask if we wanted any dessert or how our meal was (no one checked in with us while we were eating either). Not sure if we will come back .. If we do, it'll probably just be to pick up an order."}
{"text":"I ordered Spicy on my Rice dish and it was bland at best. My friend got his curry \"thai extra spicy\" and again it was very bland. I have noticed this trend often with Thai places that they don't make it as spicy as indicated, which is unfortunate for those who enjoy a little spice in your life!"}
{"text":"I really liked my food and the ambiance here. I started with the golden curry puffs which were delicious. I was a bit nervous since I dont really care for curry but I was pleasantly surprised. I had the Drunken noodles as my main dish with xtra egg and no meat. I love the flavors and could taste the freshness. It was a little lite on the basil. This was disappointing but not a deal breaker. I finished with the sticky rice and custard which did not disappoint. My only complaint is that the restaurant smelled a little stuffy. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Delicious, flavorful food and decent prices. Service is pretty good as well. They have an extensive vegetarian menu and a variety of items. I love this restaurant and have been here many times, and will continue to come back."}
{"text":"I would rate Yupha's a 4 just for food quality and taste which is amazing. It is certainly spicy, so be careful about spice levels if you go there the first time.

The rating here is including service and etiquette of wait staff. They are certainly not very well trained to handle different situations.

I had taken a friend for that person's birthday, while the food was good, the wait staff kept on asking us strange questions every few minutes. It became evident later that it could have been solved easily as they were closing the register after lunch, and they wanted us to pay ASAP.

Such clarity of communication could not be expected of the wait staff here. It leaves a uncomfortable impression in any customer's mind. While I want to go there for the food, I would discourage about taking anybody there for any special occasion."}
{"text":"Hello, lunch special!
For $9,99 - you get a kale salad from the salad bar with a warm peanut dressing, vegetable broth soup, and entree and a spring roll. You can't beat it. Plus they are quick - so you can get in and out of the place in close to a half hour if you want to. Don't be weary of the large lunch crowd - the tables turn quickly and you will be happy that you waited.

Beyond it being inexpensive, it is worth every penny. I am completely in love with the red chicken curry. It's savory and spicy - has lots of veggies - eggplant, peppers, carrots, bamboo shoots. It is very filling - but hard not to eat the whole plate. 

I have also loved the drunken noodles. 

I would say that the Tom Kha Gai soup - it is very good, but it is a little overwhelmingly strong in the lemongrass department. 

I really haven't gone wrong here. I have recently recruited my coworkers to jump on the bandwagon - and they are just as much as a fan as me! So if you are in the area, try it out."}
{"text":"Food was good,  kind of pricey , service wad terrible.  Person servingis did not do a very good job.  Will not be back"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai in Tempe.  The garlic chicken and pad Thai are great.  They don't \"Americanize\" their spicy scale, so be careful what you wish for when ordering.  The building is pretty and their lunch specials are great.  They have a little buffet style setup to get soup and salad while waiting on your food to come out."}
{"text":"The food was actually a little bland.  Had fried rice that was pretty mushy.  Wait staff ignored us a little bit, but they were pretty busy."}
{"text":"So this place is pretty darn heavy on my rotation.
I've come here in big groups, small groups, by
myself - and this place never disappoints. It
does get crowded so I try to usually come here
after 1pm when the crowd dies down a bit. This
is yet another place where I constantly run into
groups of people from my workplace. Heck we might
as well just hold all our meetings here. Maybe the
attendance would improve.  
Parking is never a problem as it's part of a big
mall. Service is always pretty good even if the 
place is packed. Probably because this place has so
many regulars. I know folks that come here more than
once a week. I usually go for the lunch special - 
posted right at the entrance. The lunch menu is not
that big so the specials are often the thing to try.
If not for the specials I go for the red curry. 
Nice and spicy. Oh yeah. You start out with a salad
buffet with peanut sauce dressing. You can also get
soup with that. Very reasonably priced for all you 
get."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food!!!! Had the best dinner tonight. We ordered the chicken satay which was fantastic. The side of cucumber salad was so light and refreshing! Also enjoyed the siam lettuce wrap which comes with two different sauces. Hands down the best wraps ever! Entrees we thoroughly enjoyed included the pad thai, seafood yellow curry, himalai, and thai jerkey with a side of papaya salad. We would highly recommend any of the entrees we had! Can't wait for our next meal at Yupha's!"}
{"text":"The food is good but I ordered $10  to go container of their peanut dressing Anna they works only took it up 80% of the way even when I asked them fill it up. For ten dollars if should have been full."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here is awesome! I especially love the pad Thai and the drunken noodles. The mango desert is yum too!"}
{"text":"I decided to go with the yellow curry so I could compare to other thai places. While I enjoyed it, I felt that I liked Thai Rama's better. I know, blasphemy to the Yupha's faithful.

It was a touch less spicy than Rama, which could be better or worse depending on who you are. It seems like other reviewers have reported slightly more mild flavors too, so there may be something to that. They also served far less rice than Rama. While they will bring you more rice... Rama will bring you a large bowl and repeatedly ask if you want more. Total rice in the original bowl was about 1 cup. Which maybe I don't know how to properly eat thai, but that is far enough for a whole meal of curry.

I also got the crab puffs, which were freaking awesome.

I went with a vegetarian and they felt that their options were limited. If you are a vegetarian and don't want tofu (like my company) then you can ask for more vegetables in place of the tofu if you want.

I'd go back here no problem. I liked it.

Note: beware of having a group of 5 or more. That will warrant an automatic tip added to your bill."}
{"text":"Had a leisurely lunch recently with some dear friends that I don't see too often:

This place is is small and nicely decorated.  I love Pad Thai and am on a mission to find the best  peanut sauce in the valley, so wanted to try Yupha\"s with this in mind.  We met up on a Saturday and ordered a lot of apps to try them all.  First of all, the food was really yummy and there was a ton of it.  We consulted our waitress and she was really helpful in terms of making recommendations.

My pad thai was delicious, as were the spring rolls and peanut sauce.  As always, there were plenty of leftovers for later snacking.  My friends highly recommended their appetizers as well.  They also had plenty to take home.

Yupha's is really fairly priced; their quality ingredients and great service really made this a pleasant experience for all of us.  I can recommend  them to anyone who enjoys good Thai food."}
{"text":"Really good Thai.  Drunken noodles and red curry are outstanding."}
{"text":"On a whim went here for dinner. Sits in the Pollack Tempe plaza close to the cinemas, comic store, etc. the restaurant is decorated with large Thai art like the huge floating market painting and huge faces of the Buddha and notes of bamboo dividers between some tables and the entrance walk-in. Smells of the food resonated from the nose to my tummy. 

So much to choose from: March specials and regular menu items. I had to try the Drunken Noodles and the Panang Curry which are my Go-to dishes. 

Drunken noodles: Mild. Chicken. Onions. Bell peppers. Tomato. Napa cabbage. Thai basil. Flat noodles. Sweet. Savory. $10.50

Panang Curry. Medium. Chicken. String beans. Red bell peppers. Lime leaves. Coconut milk. One small bowl of rice. Sweet n savory.  $12

Fried Banana with ice cream. $7.50

Small bowl of rice: $1.50. Disappointingly a little overpriced especially since the Panang curry came with only one small bowl to begin with. I personally think the Panang curry should have at least come with 2 small bowl worth of rice. The rest of the curry liquid needs the rice to complement the dish. 

I originally wanted the March special dessert: mango and blueberry stuffed crepe for $5.99 but unfortunately they were out!! 

Waitress and staff were smiley, polite and helpful!"}
{"text":"Wowzers! The hubby and I have been searching for a place like this for a long time. Awesome food, great service, good sized plates, relaxing ambiance... Couldn't ask for more. A little more pricier than the other place we went to but well worth it. Definitely found our new Thai place!"}
{"text":"Excellent and consistent food always. The red curry with chicken was really good and the shrimp recommendations in the curry were also awesome. Yuphas fried rice that my kids had was mild spice to sweet and that is the way they like it. Ours was as spicy as we both liked it and overall excellent food. Our experience of service at this place over the many visits has been different. Today was good and sometimes they dont even have the time to checkin after food is delvered at the table. I rate food at 5 and service at 4 but still give them something in between !"}
{"text":"Tried this place out because I was in the area. Expected the food to be great but it was not good at all. I got pad Thai with beef and crab puffs. The beef was so tough and couldn't even chew it and also the they wrapped the crab puffs in a egg roll wrapper. Who does that?? Will not be coming back to this place! Go to Chon Thai food on Dobson and warner, the food is amazing and staff so friendly!"}
{"text":"I've been eating Thai food since I was little, so I guess you could say I'm pretty critical of the food. 

The food is probably the best food I've found in the area, but compared to all of the Thai places I would frequent in Chicago, Yupha's is rather sub-par. Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but the prices are pretty high. (Some prices are higher than Chicago prices). Another one of my biggest qualms with Yupha's is that the food is rather inconsistent.

I once ordered the Tom Yum which was great, but the second time was terrible. I also ordered the House Salad which is really good, but I was surprised at how small it was, a couple weeks later it came with extra ingredients and was huge.

Overall, it's definitely a place to try, especially if you're critical of your Thai food. It'll probably be the best Thai food in Phoenix, but I still can't believe some of the prices."}
{"text":"The service received was very good and has been in the past.  Just tried lunch recently and the lunch menu isn't much though you're offered quite a bit with soup (broth) and salad.  Still I have to say $8 for what I ate was a pricey lunch.  I asked for MILD and there were so many red flakes in my dish which caused me to perspire profusely.  I eat those hot yellow chiles and love them though they cause the same reaction.  When I order a MILDLY spicy dish, I expect mild, esp when I want to be sweat free going out after my meal.  I was disappointed.  When I order at MINT THAI, I get the right amount of heat with TONS of flavor.  Sorry guys."}
{"text":"I've tried a couple of the other local Thai places in Ahwatukee and Chandler...this place blows them out of the water! The wine we had was great.  The food is seasoned perfectly. We shared the golden curry puffs, chicken satay, and green curry. My favorite is the chicken satay and the peanut sauce that came with it, but the other food was still delicious and I would order again. We came late after work tonight when they were almost closing and the service was still great! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Five stars, because you can't give six. We had the sampler, ped gaeng daeng, and drunken noodles. Cooked perfectly and yummy. Portions are good sized, plan on lunch for the next day. Prices are good considering portions. Ambience is great; love the classical yoga like music. Definitely try the rasberry tea."}
{"text":"I have never been to Yupha's for sit-down and have ordered out 3-5 times. I have tried the curry and the pad thai, which have both been amazing. When I have ordered out during lunch, it is always crowded (at least for weekdays), so I would make sure to come early. The food was authentic and cooked consistently well. The only reason why I have knocked it down a star (a half star if I could) is that my orders have not always been right or on time. I call in 15 minutes beforehand and they tell me when my food will be ready. However, twice I have showed up and had to wait at least another 10 minutes because my food was not ready. Another time, my request to not have any bean sprouts was not accepted and I ended up having to pick out all the beansprouts. Obviously, these aren't the end of the world problems, but things to consider. 

It is a little bit more expensive than Swaddee and not as big of portions, but the food itself is on par."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, bad service overshadows any positives... food took 45min to be served & waiter never stopped by to check-in. Yet when the check came out, 18% gratuity had been automatically added because we were a party of 5 - yes 5, not 8, but 5... There is no incentive to provide good service & when I complained to the manager the excuse given was the \"system\" is setup for that automatically. Disregarding completely my reason for wanting to adjust the % down - i.e. bad service... the food is average & a bit overpriced so not worth it."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have ever had the calamari was cooked perfectly and the curry was enough to make me cry but not overpowering to the point of getting a fire hydrant put in my mouth. Staff was really friendly truly 5 stars"}
{"text":"So good!!! Their are so many vegan and veg. options!! Great food great service can wait to go back. We had the drunken noodles and they were great"}
{"text":"I am not the most experienced Thai food eater, but I have been on a Thai kick lately and Yupha has been the answer. I am in looooove with the fried rice. Great portion, amazzzing taste. Love at first bite!

I like to compliment it with the sweet and sour entree with tofu. I get it mild and it's plenty spicy for my taste. The sweet and sour is not like that of a Chinese restaurant, but I'm thinking I like it better. It's more like sweet and spice and that is A-OK with me. It is also a generous portion and includes a side of white rice which is delicious when drenched in the sauce.

The staff has always been incredibly nice and the service is usually pretty speedy. I like the setting of the dining area too, it's usually pretty quiet when I've been in there and it's a relaxing setting.

I would definitely recommend going here to anyone looking for some delicious Thai food!"}
{"text":"WOW! The food came faster then our Arizona summer! It took a total of 3 minutes from ordering to being served and my meal was tasty, steamy hot, and very fresh. I got the Pad Garlic Sauce with Chicken in Medium heat and I could have gone spicier. I came here because of the amount of reviews this place had and I will definitely be coming back here in the future. The service is quick and my waitress was very friendly and attentive. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a small neighborhood location with very good food & attentive service.  I often meet colleagues here for lunch and I've had dinner too.  During peak hours, there is often a short wait but it's worth the time!"}
{"text":"Busy during lunch time service was still quick! I ordered the drunken noodle with tofu. I love using the eggroll sauce and pouring it all over the dish. It made it so sweet and even more flavorful. I was very happy with my meal."}
{"text":"being new to the area, i'm really on a quest to nail down my basic food groups: thai, persian, and mexican. mexican i've got down i think, but the other two i've kind of been baffled by. luckily i have my very own personal tour guide who invited me to lunch at yupha's one day. 

the place is pretty cute but can get pretty crowded when in the full swing of lunch. the tables are kind of close together, so be sure you arent carrying a big purse or anything otherwise you'll be whacking people in the head with it.

i had the pad thai for lunch. HUGE lunch portions. i could barely finish a third of it and i had a ton to take home for dinner. also if you arent into spicy, i'd definitely go mild. medium spicy is pretty groovin, but i dont think it would work out well for someone who only wants a little spice. yupha's also has an interesting salad bar/soup thing that comes with some of the lunches. check out the salad with the peanut dressing. mmmmmm peanut dressing. i loves it. 

service is fast and friendly. take your check up to the front if you want to get out of here quickly. i think yupha's is going to be my work lunch thai place :). garlic beef here i come!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the valley! Gets very busy around peak meal times. I would recommend going for lunch and arriving by 11:30, at the latest or it will be packed with slow service. For lunch, you will get their soup, spring roll, lunch prices (around $8-10) and salad bar with the delish peanut dressing(bottle this, please!). 

The pad see ew, pad thai(slight sweetness but not overpowering) , thai fried rice(sticky rice with tons of savory flavor) and massaman curry(creamy and spicy heaven. Add zucchini) are all to die for. Literally, this could be my last meal. The spice levels are no joke. I love spice but get mild here because anything higher makes my nose and eyes run for the rest of the day. Note that the curries do not automatically come with peanuts do to customer allergies but all you need to do is ask. Friendly, helpful service, willing to customize dishes to meet your taste."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely fantastic! I highly recommend the drunken noodles and make them spicy. I also really loved the Thai fried rice. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back!!!  I had the seafood Pad Thai double Thai hot.  I am glad I didn't choose triple Thai hot, my mouth was burning good but with lots of flavor.  There was lots of shrimp, scallops, calamari and mussels so that every bite had some in it."}
{"text":"Very nicely appointed place, nicely done. The Thai tea was just okay, and although the Phad Thai was tasty, it was real greasy. I may try it again, may not,"}
{"text":"#304 w/ chicken was great as was the red curry w/ tofu. Wine costs about same as an entree so water might be the preferred beverage."}
{"text":"Great taste! Fresh produce and meat! Serve yourself salad and soup bar. Soup is so simple yet ssooo delish! The food always comes out quick and hot! Most of the servers are very friendly and they are all polite. Great place for lunch as they can get you in and out quickly without compromising quality and freshness. I order the Pad Gra Prow almost everytime. The Pad Thai is tasty and their Drunken Noodle is my boyfriends favorite! I order a Thai Iced Tea every time I go, yum!"}
{"text":"This review is a retrospective as I've been enjoying lunch here every Friday for the last five years.  I've always felt welcomed, from the owner, the hostess and the waitresses.  Do they get very busy at lunch?  Yes they do, so if you're hungry, be considerate and be ready to order.  The salad bar is always fresh and the peanut dressing, delicious.  The vegetable consomme is light and flavorful.  Entrees?  From the lunch menu, I've had them all.  The Pad See Ew, noodles in black soy (all entrees choice of pork, chicken, beef, shrimp, tofu) with broccoli and egg is a standout.  As are the drunken noodles, Pad Khing Sod (if you love ginger), and the Pad Prikh King, with bean curd.  You can order any level of heat that you prefer, from mild to triple Thai hot.  Not on the lunch menu, but highly recommended, are any of the duck dishes, which come to your table sizzling (always an attention getter!).  The duck is tender and succulent, never dry or greasy.  My experiences here have been universally wonderful, over many years.  How's that for a review?"}
{"text":"Good food. Reasonable prices. Strange line on their menu which states \"no sharing\". My wife and I shared and no one said anything... The service was good. We'll eat here again."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place - just another Thai food joint in a strip mall. THe chicken pad thai at 10 bucks was oily and wet and wasn't that appetizing at all. It was a big portion, but that was the only plus side. Then at $2.50, I tried the sticky rice, but that was a mistake as well. The rice was undercooked and yes it did stick together, but did not even come close to a true sticky rice experience. It was more like crunchy, undercooked sticky rice wrapped in a banana leaf. Onto the next Thai joint."}
{"text":"New to Arizona and I am always in search of good Asian food! I'm Asian (I feel like this post will be significantly more meaningful if I state this fact) and I can honestly say this is one of the better Thai restaurants I've had in my life. I actually just got back from Thailand 6 months ago and food in Thailand wasn't even comparable to this place.  I went with a group of 16 people. They brought out our food simultaneously close together without any issues.  

I went with the classic Pad Thai dish with shrimp and chicken. It was anything but ordinary. Even without the spiciness (because I'm a wimp), the dish was super flavorful. I think I just salivated writing this post. Definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"I don't see what all the fuss is about. I've eaten here twice and was disappointed both times. The food just wasn't that good. They nickel and dime customers by charging for things no other restaurant would charge for ($2.00 for a little extra sauce). Don't plan to return, hope not to. :-("}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time today. Defiantly good. I had the  Pad Thai. It's hard to tell on a wide range as I have had more on at Thai Basil. What I had today was definitely good."}
{"text":"i've been here twice and both times was extremely happy. the servers are very friendly and prompt and the atmosphere is nice and quiet. i've not seen it busy either time, and we went around dinner time.

i usually get beef with basil, green onions and white onions. i've gotten it medium both times, it's delicious. not very spicy and just the right amount of flavor.  Matthew usually gets the thai fried rice with tofu and just loves it.
we've tried some appetizers; the chicken satay and the spring rolls. the sauce that comes with the satay is wonderfully peanut-y and spicy.

not too expensive, highly recommend."}
{"text":"We went there after work, 5:30PM, and let them know we had movie tickets and the time of the showing. The food came out quickly and in plenty of time for us to make the movie. I ordered Tom Yum Gai (coconut milk soup) and Thai Fried Rice, my friend ordered duck (can't remember which one). I had chicken in the rice and tofu in the soup as I wasn't sure what kind of tofu it was (PF Chang's uses one that has a terrible texture). I loved the tofu, next time I'll get it in my main dish. The chicken was good, not the stark white skinny rubbery pieces found in mixed dishes. I was surprised at how delicious my food was, the flavor of the rice dish and the soup. My friend said the duck was fantastic. The servers were very attentive, filling our drinks often, and very friendly. The bathroom was clean. Great experience."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm new to the whole Thai food thing, and I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy food, so take this review for what it is....

I was told by plenty of uber-Thai food fans that this place was the bee's knees, but I wasn't too impressed. i kept it pretty standard ordering just pad thai noodles with tofu and iced tea. the iced tea was killer (i find that at most thai places, what is it with the iced thai tea phenomenon??)

the flavor was pretty bland, i have to say. it was the right amount of spicy, but just still bland, no bueno. plus, for a thai place, they did not cook the tofu well, it was totally bland, too.

i was disappointed, but i will probably go one more time because you never know if you just catch a restaurant on an off day. it was super busy on a tuesday lunch hour, too, but we got in and out pretty quickly, so it's good for a work lunch.

***update 1/08
I'm glad I made that disclaimer in my original review, because I've been back three times (only for p/u) and it's now one of my top thai places. Maybe I was bitter because my editor took me there for my year review to tell me the paper couldn't afford more than 3 percent raise (on a reporter's salary, that's about 35 cents - you can imagine my bitterness). Hahahaha. I'm still not 100 percent a fan of their tofu, but the other entrees I've tried are not as bland as my OG visit.

It's a great spot to pick up even if I just walk in and order because, what I assume is the owner (a middle-aged Asian women who dresses professional), is SOOO nice and helpful* with the menu and there is a small bar (really small, like 4-5 seats) where I can order a draft and hang out for the 10-15 minutes it takes to make my order.

*definition of \"soooo nice and helpful\": She answered all our questions regarding level of spiciness and confusion over which entrees included noodles or rice patiently and with a smile; suggested one of the most delicious fried banana/ice cream desserts I've ever had; and, one time she realized we weren't finished with our beers when our tightly packaged food was place on the bar, so she spent five minutes undoing the tie to poke holes in the to-go boxes so the steam could escape and not make our food \"sweaty\". RIGHT ON!

that definitely earned them an extra star for service! so... more like 3 and half


***************************
i'm bumping up another half star because their stellar customer service is dead-ion consistent every single time i come here. i highly recommend the Yupha's House fried rice with tofu - flavorful and not too greasy. and big points for being able to order every single item on the menu as spicy as you want it."}
{"text":"So a co-worker took us to this place.  I barely know this co-worker, which is to say that I have no idea if she's a culinary idiot or if she's worth listening to.  I have issues leaving my comfort zone.

Well we ordered the Kew Something appetizer, which is basically pork wontons.  As in, seven pork molecules in a wonton with some sweet and sour on the side.  Tasty, but not the sort of thing that I'd pay $6 for.  One star deduction.

But I had Kao Pad (which is a little disturbing sounding) but it is essentially fried rice.  With onions and tomatoes and egg and scallions.  She asked if I wanted it spicy.  I did.  She looked at me like I was a fool, as if I couldn't hang.  I can.

I don't generally love fried rice with spice, but I do like rhyming.  So I tried it, and it was amazing.  Really probably the best fried rice I've had in years.  Next time I'd try beef instead of pork but no complaints--for $8 you get a ton of it and it is sensational.

The spice is pretty hot.  I got hot, which is not as hot as Thai Spicy, but still spicy for sure.  I was fine with it, because that's just how I roll, but Dallas G's head was sweating profusely, creating quite a look.  Kind of like a shabby chic, with sweat.

Anyway.  I have yet to try anything else but what I had was delish.  And unlike my suspect co-worker, you can trust me."}
{"text":"The staff were friendly, the place is great and the food was wonderful. 

Food was hot, well presented, and delicious. I hope I'm in that area again to try it."}
{"text":"Sure your food is fresh and your flavors are exquisite.



.....but your service smells like shit."}
{"text":"I was not as impressed with this place as I am with Thailicious or Tasty Thai. I did enjoy their soup, but I really like the salad that Thailicious serves a lot more. The peanut dressing is better at Thailicious too. Tasty Thai has an amazing salad, but its more of a pepper dressing that is equally amazing, just different, not sweet like the peanut dressing. I had the Pad See Ew which was OK. I like the Pad See Ew from Thai Basil the most. My lunch buddy had the Drunken Noodles and I have to admit, they were really good! I wished I would have ordered that instead. The little spring rolls were good, but I enjoyed them the least out of any other Thai restaurant in the valley I have been to. This place was recommended to me but I don't think I will be back unless my friends talk me into going with them for lunch again. And if I do go, I will be getting the drunken noodles for sure! There are other Thai restaurants around that have better food and cost the same. We got there around 11:30 and at around 11:50 it started filling up quick, so if you do want to try it out, get there early before it fills up. They also charge extra to split plates and charge extra for to-go. I have never been to another Thai place that does that. 
Overall, friendly staff, ok salad, great soup, ok food."}
{"text":"Update 07/03/2017:  I was very disappointed with the food tonight. I've been here many times and this was not good. $15 for 6 grilled shrimp with little flavor on top of a bed of iceberg lettuce and a ton of raw red onions. Dressing was red chili paste with lime and yes....more onions. So disappointing. The Tom Kha soup had little chicken and was overpowered by lime. Hmmm...I don't think I will be back. 


Service was very accommodating and helpful with suggestions. I tried a noodle dish that I typically don't get and liked it. I will return again, as I have been here several times"}
{"text":"I have loved everything I have ordered here.  If you like curry I highly recommend the blend of the green and yellow curry, it is one of my favorites.  They also offer a small side of fried rice, which is really tasty and it is nice to be able to order a smaller portion.  Drunken Noodles are great and the roasted chicken is really good too.  I have yet to try the duck, but will soon.  I pick up take-out from here at least once a month and the service is always quick and polite."}
{"text":"Nice lunch menu which includes salad and soup, I think we spend about $17 total.  I don't really like getting the soup and salad at a Thai restaurant but it was self serve and the vegetables were super fresh and the dressing optional.  We had the drunken noodles and the pad thai, both well prepared, hot and very delicious.  The restaurant was clean, modern and had a really nice atmosphere especially considering it was lunch.  Will definetely be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good Thai restaurant! Not the best I have ever tried but it was clean and had friendly service. I had the drunken noodles and the medium spicy was definitely hotter than other Thai places I've been and that made it a little hard to fully enjoy my meal. Fried banana and coconut ice cream for dessert was really good, would definitely recommend that. Also tried the curry puffs appetizer and that was super yummy. Worth a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurants because it had great reviews and I ordered the Pad Thai and it was the worse Pad Thai I have ever had in my life. The beef smelled like a dead dog. There was waaay too much sauce in those noodles. I mean I really had a horrible experience and it was so gross that to this day I can't eat certain foods because i feel disgusted by anything. I rarelly want to eat now because I have that smell in my head."}
{"text":"We went here last night for dinner. The space is large with nice decor. Everyone was friendly and the food was great. We kept to our easy menu items; pad Thai, pad see ew, and Thai fried rice. They have a small kids menu and sturdy high chairs which was a bonus to us. The food is delicious with decent size portions. Wish they had crayons and coloring menus for the little one, but they were still very nice and prompt about everything."}
{"text":"Good Thai. Third best I've had in the valley. Chanpen and Thai e-San are better. I like that this place has a salad bar with lunch."}
{"text":"First time eating here very tasty food. Tried the 117. Drunken Noodle awesome my wife had the 120. Kao Pad she loved it! me 2 :)  Thanks see you soon."}
{"text":"Came here Sunday to grab lunch. Walked in and was greeted by pleasant staff who sat me down right away. Ordered the Thai Iced Tea and (chicken) Pad Thai medium-hot, not as spicy as I would have hoped but sometimes \"Thai hot\" can be insanity. If you like it hot absolutely go for it. Interestingly they had a small salad and soup bar included with lunch that had an awesome warm peanut dressing. Vegetable soup was good but be sure to get to the veggies on the bottom, without its basically broth. An egg roll is included with the lunch special. Definitely will be returning!!"}
{"text":"Okay, it was a couple of weeks ago. Went there with a couple of friends. Yummy food, great curry, great portion of soup, but the sticky rice dessert, yummy, yummy, yummy. Saw the lines to wait when we were leaving, so prepare. I think they have a buffet for lunch, would love to try this sometime."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy this restaurant.  However, after today's lunch experience, I am left with a sour taste in my mouth (literally, too).
My friend and I walked in and was not greeted.  We waited until we were finally lead to a table.  Two lunch menus were thrown at us.  However, no alcoholic beverages.  I asked for a drinks menu and the waitress pointed at the soda/coffee/tea beverage portion at the bottom and seemed very impatient.  When I said drinks with alcohol, she sneered said...\"umm....okay...\"  Is it usual to drink a little bit for lunch?
Then, my friend had a question about the basil used there:  is it regular sweet basil or the more fabulous and exquisite spicy Holy basil.  The waitress rolled her eyes and said it was the \"better kind\".  That doesn't explain anything, so my friend asked to see the basil (he's particular about taste).  The waitress grunted and grumpily brought out the basil.  It was the regular sweet Thai basil.  
My friend decided to order another dish because he doesn't like regular sweet basil and asked why he doesn't see Panang Curry on the menu.  The waitress once again rolled her eyes and said \"Do you think it's dinner now or something?  That's only on the dinner menu.\"  She did offer to make a dinner exception but we were turned off by then.  We ended up ordering the red curry.  (Seriously, why is panang curry only a dinner thing?)
When the food finally arrived, it was lukewarm.  My friend asked for Thai spicy, and it was very mild.  I, even with my sensitive stomach, didn't even feel the heat.
For the price, it was pricy!  And the portions are small.  We did get a lot of white rice, but white rice is cheap anyway.
Needless to say, I won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Pad Thai noodles.  My  coworker and I try to get it every other week for lunch. I'm so glad it's close and not too expensive."}
{"text":"Yupha's is simply best Thai food I have ever had. Their green curry, red curry, phad prik king, and noodle dishes are all each the best I've ever been served. The included soup and salad round out an excellent meal. Service starts with a smile at the front counter, quick seating or addition to the wait list (they always fill up), and efficient order taking. All of the staff are dedicated to taking care of you well beyond what we should expect from a $10/head lunch place. I can't find a reason to go to any other Thai restaurant. 
Only downside is that Yupha's always fills up at peak times. Those in the know know that a short wait is always worth the amazing food and service."}
{"text":"Growing up in an Asian house hold, we always had asian food. I'm Cambodian and our foods are very much close to Thai food the only difference is the spices. 

I've tried many different thai food restaurants but no one beats Yupha's. Their pad thai is very delicious and like it hot with extra bean sprouts. You can control how spicy you want the food. 

When you are there you should also try their salad with the peanut dressing. Its hard to describe how good it is you would have to try it yourself. 

The prices are reasonable, if you love thai food you should try out this place."}
{"text":"Definitely good Thai food! 

Don't live in Tempe anymore but my folks do. Decided to try this place out and introduce my girlfriend to my parents here. We all had a very pleasant experience. The service was ehhh. But (with all due respect) Asians generally have 'whatever' service anyways. Maybe it's a cultural thing. Anyways, the food was great, wait wasn't long, and fresh atmosphere. They also do some pretty creative things with their presentation. To top it off my parent loved my girlfriend! ;) 

Pros
-Great food
-Endless selection
-Short wait times
-Cool looking place
-reasonable prices

Cons
-average servers who aren't too welcoming
-inside needs more creative depth"}
{"text":"Able to do gluten free. Not listed on the menu but just ask. I had the GF Pad Sew Ew and it was delicious. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I would eat here everyday if that wasn't considered eatery stalking, plus who knows the looks I would get. I love the pad thai with shrimp and extra peanuts! I said it!

Come on down, I will probably be there."}
{"text":"I have been to many Thai restaurants in the Valley and this is the one that I aways go back to. Their roasted duck is consistently good. Get the Ped gang daeng (801)."}
{"text":"I love Yupha's!  The bottom line: great Thai food at reasonable prices with excellent customer service.

I've been here two or three times in the last couple of months for dinner with one of my best friends.  The last time I went here our server recognized us and said, \"I recognize you!  You guys come here often!\"  This place is always busy, so it was incredible that our server recognized us as quickly as she did.  Perhaps it's the strangeness of our order - I generally order things just under Thai hot, and she orders things with no spice at all.

I generally order the Pad Thai with an appetizer (often their spring rolls).  They're very conscious of dietary restrictions:  I order my dish with tofu, and they always ask me if egg is okay.  I love that they do that.  I've always found their spice level to be spot-on.  My dishes have the right amount of heat, and my friend never complains about anything being too spicy.  I really appreciate that they trust me when I order my dish hot, but I've also seen them bring out jars of chili flakes and chili oil to patrons who are requesting something a bit spicier.

The portions are perfectly scaled.  If I'm ravenously hungry, I can eat the whole plate without feeling overly full.  If my hunger is at normal levels, I can eat about half the plate and will end up taking the rest home as leftovers.

This place is always busy for dinner, but I've never had to wait to get a table.  The restaurant is spacious and extremely clean.  I never feel like I have to wait long for anything - drinks, someone to take our order, food, or the check.

There are a lot of decent Thai restaurants in Phoenix, but this one is a gem.  If you're craving Thai, come to Yupha's!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai food place. I've been here more so for lunch, but have also had the occasional dinner. The food is always delish!"}
{"text":"I have loved Yupha's since they were further west down Elliot. We went in tonight for a birthday meal and they have changed their menus, with notable price increase and a few new items. If it keeps them in business I don't mind at all. Their food is always spot on. I had the Panang curry with tofu and my partner had the duck. Yum!"}
{"text":"I have visited Yupha's Thai Kitchen once for lunch and once for dinner.  Let it be known that they close for a short period between lunch and dinner so you have to make it before 3pm for lunch or after 5pm for dinner.  The lunch was very nice although the lunch menu had somewhat limited options in comparison to the numerous dinner menu offerings.  The lunch menu offered the most popular Thai fare for an average lunch price.  During their lunch hours, Yuhpa's offers a little soup and salad bar at which you can make your own little Thai salad and/or soup.  Although soup and salad bar is very basic, I was impressed with sweet and rich peanut dressing and the ornately cut cucumbers.  The ambiance was pleasant with it's contemporary decor and high ceilings.  My dinner visit was much more exciting as the dinner menu was far more extensive with some unique Thai dishes such as the Thai Jerky with Papaya salad.....both delicious, I might add!  The curry was very good also.  The presentation of everything was lovely as well.  I also noticed upon leaving that they have a live Jazz band that plays on certain nights, something that I will surely be back to check out.  Indeed I have many dishes to try before I add Yupha's to my list of favorite Thai restaurants, but it has definitely caught the attention of my taste buds for my future Tempe Thai cravings!"}
{"text":"Stop reading and just go. You won't regret it. But if you want to know more, let me explain that Yupha's has spoiled me with their excellent Thai food. I travel for work and now it is hard for me to try other Thai places because Yupha's sets the bar so high.  Everything I have tried has been stellar and I'm addicted to their Tom Kha soup, it is the BEST! Just thinking about it makes me salivate.  Bottomline: High quality, flavorful food in a clean, elegant restaurant with amazing specials that change monthly...Yupha's is a solid 5 Star."}
{"text":"Wow, red curry with pumpkin is so yummy.  Service was terrific, interior is nice too.  What a fantastic Thai place, wish it wasn't 30 miles away."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other day and have to say I was a bit dissapointed to what I expected to find.
It was just 1:00 and they were not all that busy at all. Service was very slow, but, there did not seem to be a reason for that. I ordered and a salad bar or soup comes with the lunch. I chose the soup that you get yourself, it was not that good.
But, before I did that ,I had gone in to the bathroom to wash my hands. It was not very clean.
Soup was plain, and the lunch was good. But, the staff all sat down to have their lunch  as well. Which meant they were not attentive to the customers. There was about 5 tables in there. But, why not wait until your luch service is over. THey close for lunch at 2:30.
I just found that to be in poor taste to sit down to eat,in the middle of your lunch service while you are still waiting on people.
Not too impressed with this place any more."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurant you can find in Tempe, the price is average but I think it's reasonable since the food is extremely tasty, love lunch time if you order and entree you get soup and salad with it, the peanut salad dressing is going to knock your socks off. The dessert is really good but I wish they could make the portion a little bit more since you're pay $5-7. I usually get the beef pad Thai but the curry is good too."}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix.  The food is always excellent whether we eat in the restaurant or take it home.  The service is always quick and friendly as well.  We highly recommend Yupha's!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Great curries pad Thai and curry puffs are amazing! The owners are very nice and always remember us as we are regulars. Best Thai in Phoenix I have found!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of pad thai. This place has always been my go to and I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow, best red coconut curry ever!  This place is great, totally not what I expected.  I went there for the first time with my friend for lunch.  We were sat right away and food came out about 20 minutes later. The service was just okay, we had to ask for our drinks twice and for a box, but they were busy, so I'll give her a pass. They attract a large lunch crowd and I was impressed how well they managed.   The salad bar was good too; it was small but had nice fresh veggies and a yummy peanut dressing!  My friend had the pad Thai with tofu, I thought it was okay, but the compared to the rocking flavor of the curry it really didn't stand a chance.  I will say, when I said I wanted it medium she highly recommended I go with mild spice and they could add more if needed... definitely didn't need it!  Yum, yum... go get some!"}
{"text":"If you go there on a Friday or Saturday night, the place is packed! Oh, and if you go there at lunch time, it's packed too! That's because IT'S WORTH THE WAIT! The food is delicious, the portion sizes are adequate, and the staff is fast and friendly. Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Hey - if you're in Tempe and looking for good Thai food - head to Yupha's.  Friendly staff and great food!

I ordered (if you've read my other Thai restaurant reviews - prepare to be unsurprised) Panang beef...I went with medium spice level (because I'm old and spicy hurts me now ;-) and it was perfect...much hotter, and I would've been suffering for it, any less, and it would've been disappointing...nailed it!

Everyone in our party enjoyed what they ordered...and, for a change, we ordered dessert.  A couple of flaming fried ice creams and a coconut ice cream - all were very tasty.

You know what, scratch what I said at the top - even if you're NOT in the Temp area, but are hungry for some Thai food, head to Yupha's!!"}
{"text":"3.75...Heres the thing...I've had really awesome food here (drunken noodles and green curry) and I've had some so so food here (Pad garlic w/chicken, pra ram). 
It could be that I went at different times of the day, but who knows. The thai hot is NOT hot. If I order thai hot I expect it my mouth to be flaming. It was more like a medium spice level. 

It's good but I like another place much better....Thailicious."}
{"text":"Four of us ate dinner here last night for the first time.  The place was reasonably full but there was no waiting line.  The food was good, but since I have only been there once, I cannot agree or disagree that they have the best Thai food in the area.  I can say, however, that the service was poor.  It took several minutes for our waitress to come to the table after we were seated.  One of our party wanted to take a few more minutes with the menu, so the waitress started to leave.  I asked her if she wanted to take our drinks order and she allowed as \"oh, yeah, I guess I could do that,\" almost as if it were a strange request.  She did bring the drinks, but then we did not see her to place our food order for a while.  Once we did order, the food was a bit slow to come out.  Once we were served, the service was a bit better, but there's room for improvement."}
{"text":"So, the reason for the one star is my experience with the staff. I've had experiences with bad staff before but I've never been posed with this kind.

My friend and I went in to dine around 5ish, when the restaurant seemed empty. We ordered our meal right away and ate in decent time, were done in about a half hour. We stuck around and by this time it was getting to be full. My friend wanted dessert so we ended up getting a yummy bananas foster with ice cream.

Right around this time, after finishing dessert, we were approached by a server, this is around 5:45-5:50, and were asked if we could please pay our bill as there are several other guests awaiting a table.

Am I strange to think this is a very rude thing to say to a patron? Obviously we did not come to your restaurant, drink water and sit for an hour. Then, maybe this question would have been warranted. But paying customers who ate full meals and ordered drinks, you're going to ask them to leave?

I politely spoke to the manager, rather I believe she might have been the owner due to the sizable ring on her finger and designer clothing she had on. She informed me that this was a very delicate situation as nine people were waiting on being seated and asked when we planned on leaving.

Again, since this is the first time this has ever happened to me, it may just be an experience that I haven't had before so feel free to let me know that it's not rude and I just need to be better about eating and leaving in a very timely fashion. But I can tell you, I felt thoroughly insulted and the fact that the owner or mgr was trying to get an ETA on our departure, it wasn't the best feeling on the receiving end.

I won't be going back, and I hope people understand that this is behavior backed by the owner or management, before they choose to dine here.

Oh, and my red curry was not the best I've had. Not the worst, but certainly not worthy of the treatment."}
{"text":"The food is ok. Definitely not the best Thai food I've had. If you get here for lunch their salad bar is awesome. The service here is weird and terrible. Expect to have 5 very slow waitresses who do not acknowledge you."}
{"text":"Food was good. Received no service but still got charged the gratuity for 4 adults + a child. The waitress only came to check on us one time when we're close to finish. So inattentive, even when the restaurant was not that busy. I don't mind giving 20% tip because I'm a server too, I know how it feels being a server. However, being charged the gratuity without receiving any service has given me a bad experience about the restaurant."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our dinner at this restaurant.  The classic Thai dishes were tasty.  I tried the Pad Thai, Tom Yum Soup, Pad Prik Khing and Drunken Noodles.  
I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"I drove 30 miles just to come have lunch here! They serve a fresh clean salad and soup with their specials. The Red Curry is delicious if you are craving a soup style lunch. I also recommend the Pad Prik Khing!"}
{"text":"I typically go here for lunch. Show up early as it gets very busy. They have a salad bar which is always one of the high points of lunch here.

The food is standard Thai fare. The quality and quantity is above average. I usually get curry, pad thai, or drunken noodles."}
{"text":"Great food with Fantastic service
I have been there so many time
I love their food very much
All staffs are very nice. They always help us thought menu.
I'm a big fan of Ped Gra Pow and Pad Thai Shrimp. Little mermaid and Calamari strip are delicious!!! As well"}
{"text":"One of the best thai resturants in AZ.  I love thai food and will drive out of the way to eat a good one.  But luckily for me this one is in my naighborhood.  Three good dishes that they have are the drunken noodle, the lettuce wrap & the mussels (yuphia basil).  the mussels are unique and you should try it.  I've never had it anywhere else prepared this way.  give it a try."}
{"text":"Unfortunately for this place,  i know what good Thai food is. I come from Portland, food city, where this Thai food ranks a 1/5. 

The food: i tried yellow curry, spring rolls, and sweet n sour soup. The yellow curry was ok, but lacked freshness, flavor, and vegetables. It has potatoes and half an onion in it. The spring roll was disgusting and tasted like it lay in cold oil for hours before being reheated and served to us. And the soup was flavored water, again void of real ingredients.

The service: Flat, no hello, just what do you want, I'm to busy to care attitude. The runner didnt even look at us when she brought our food out, she literally threw the food on the table,  turned, and went back to kitchen.

Bland, vanilla food void of ingredients. I think Arizona folks have never experienced good Thai food to rate this place a 4.5, I'm personally never going back."}
{"text":"DAMN GOOD THAI. Best Red Curry I've had since I was in Phuket a couple years ago. Just found out this was across the street from where I work and I'm excited to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food dinners I have had in a while.  They actually got the spicy when they say spicy.  Not that mild stuff you typically find.  Great flavor and knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"My mom and I stumbled across Yupha's Thai restaurant on accident. I ordered the drunken noodles with chicken and was hooked! Delicious! I took my husband here another time and he was also impressed with the crying tiger. The atmosphere is calm, warm and inviting. We had comfortable conversation and the service was prompt. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I think this place is often overlooked. The drunken noodles are fabulous! It's kind of hidden next to the 'Dollar' theatre, but worth trying!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge Thai connoisseur, however I can say anyone considering trying Thai for the first time or someone who knows their Thai-stuff would find Yupha's fantastic.

Once you walk inside, you already feel welcome; not only by the friendly staff, but also by the comfortable atmosphere and fun, brightly colored walls. 

Both my husband and I enjoy spicy food, however we were unsure just how hot, ordering \"spicy\" really was. So the server was kind enough to suggest we just order medium and she brought over the lovely trio of amazing sauces/spices so we could adjust our meals accordingly. 

We started with the Siam Lettuce Wraps which consisted of minced chicken sautéed with lemon grass, galanga & crushed peanuts in brown sauce and served with two sauces on the side. Holy WOW, best lettuce wrap in the world. Period. Forgot the other places you have ordered this quintessential appetizer. This is the top of the mountain as far as I am concerned. Definitely worth a taste. 

Based on the huge amount of Yelp reviews suggesting the Drunken noodles, we both decided to give them a try. I ordered mine with shrimp and the hubs ordered his with beef. 
Drunken noodles are sautéed flat noodles with cabbage, tomato, bell pepper, onion, egg, Thai basil & chili pepper. 

The Thai basil, spices and sauce gives this dish a flavor explosion and creates that palate friendly pyramid of sweet/spicy/fresh/tang that makes you say, \"did that really just happen?!\" 

Ok, maybe I am being a tad bit over the top, but I am so thrilled to have found a fantastic Thai place with amazing food, comfortable atmosphere and great service. I am already planning my return visit!"}
{"text":"Yupha's moved east about 2 miles. Don't miss the old location since this was the first time I've been here. :) But it was quite confusing to me since I drove to the old location and just couldn't find it. Luckily my phone can browse the web and I found the new location on their website.

Anyways, the new location looks pretty nice. Nice decor and the lady manning the cashier was very helpful and nice (I'm guessing that's Yupha?). I ordered the Pad Sew Ew lunch special, one of my favorite Thai noodle dishes. I took it to go though, so when I finally got him after about 30 mintues, the fried spring roll was not crisp anymore. I can't complain though and I was more interested in the noodles themselves.

What can I say? It was good, very good in fact. The right mix of soy and spicyness. Other thai restaurants get the spicyness wrong for me. I like my dishes with heat, but I can't take too much of it. And too little makes it bland. This was the correct amount of heat for me. Also, the chicken was cooked properly. Other places sometimes overcook it, making it tough and rubbery. This was still quite moist and tender.

It's a thumbs up for me, but I'll have to come back with a group to order more dishes."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in Arizona. True authentic and absolutely delicious. The green curry is my favorite dish with a spice level of three is plenty for a medium kick of heat."}
{"text":"The servers are usually friendly. Food is absolutely delicious! I love the curry buns and their pad Thai! I crave spicy food at times so this is where I go to get my fill :) will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic find for a Saturday night with a big group!

I came to Yupha's after my friends and I decided to not go to a particular Italian restaurant. I have had some really good Thai food in the past, so I have relatively high standards.

My friends opted for the standards of Pad Thai and Pad See Ew and they were both very respectable renditions of the dish, even surpassing some of my hometown favorites. I however decided on something I had been craving for months after having it at Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas a few weeks prior. The Crispy Roasted Duck.

The duck came on a hot skillet and it was a very generous portion being topped with fresh basil and caramelized onions. The duck itself was cooked more than I would have preferred, but the skin was crispy and the meat was very tender and flavorful. It was very good and I have been craving for it a past few days. Hard to beat good duck......

I also got a soup with coconut milk, mushrooms and chicken. Overall the soup had a great depth of flavor and was also very rich. It was also really really spicy, which made me want it even more.

Overall Yupha's really surprised me. I am often left satisfied, but never blown away with Thai food, but Yupha's is some of the best I have had in the United States. The crispy duck really blew me away and if I am ever in Tempe, I am heading to Yupha's."}
{"text":"Perhaps I just had an off experience with the food.  The restaurant was very crowded on a Friday night.  I got a curry that was mild.  It was very very very spicy.  I ended up eating two bowls of rice and a small amount of the curry.  Now my husband on the other hand ate my leftovers when I brought them home and loved it.  He likes really spicy food and couldn't believe what he was eating was Yupha's Mild.  I won't go again.  I love love love Papaya Thai."}
{"text":"The food was great. Service great. Cute place. The pad thai was amazing. The yellow curry was ok. We asked for hot but it didnt taste that spicy. The shrimp in the pad thai wasnt very good.but the chicken in it was great. Overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Yupha's has amazing food and beverage. My girlfriend and I frequent this restaurant often b/c it is so delicious. We usually start off with an app and always get the Drunken Noodle. We've tried other things but we always make our way back to the drunken Their Thai tea with cream is also really good-the spices are def interestingly different but worth a try if you've never had it.
The atmosphere is nice, clean, and the employees are friendly. Sometimes service is slow which is pretty much my only complaint and why they didn't receive all the stars."}
{"text":"I am a little embarrassed to be writing a negative review, as I have been to this eatery many times and it was always lovely.

We went on a Saturday night -before- Valentine's day the next day, and it was crowded, yet not -packed- packed.We did not have to wait, though there was a wait list for a larger table.

We were snagged by a waitress, she took our drink order[ more on that later], we got our water.
Then a -different- waitress came to our table, took our appetizer order and right away asked for our dinner order selection.before we had even decided on our appetizer, pen hovering impatiently over order pad. Ok then.

My husband ordered the crispy duck [Ped Gaeng Daeng* $18.00 
Crispy roast duck topped red curry, coconut milk, tomatoes, pineapple, bell peppers & Thai basil.]. It arrived as we were still nibbling on our appetizer, without rice.[ different waitress -again-].And sat there.Waiting on my order I assume?

There was nothing crispy about it- in fact, skin was\"wet\", and it was dry in inself[an admirable feat, achieving both at the same time, and yet here we were].They usually make amazing duck, but this blew.

At this point in time, my order arrives[Sizzling Cod Filet with Soy and Ginger Sauce $18.99
Healthy, light and delicious Cod filet steamed in soy sauce, ginger, leek, fresh shitake mushroom and white wine, served on hot skillet.].

At this point, rice arrives for us both[tiny portion]. By now, my husband's duck is cold. had he been supposed to choke it down -before- my food came?It kinda -was- a pre valentine's date.

My cod was very nice, but...it kinda is hard to mess up cod.It was in a lovely, fragrant broth, sure, but 19 bucks worth of broth and magical unicorn tears? probably not.

Our drink orders?No where to be seen.Still.[ we had ordered thai iced teas]

As my husband is hacking away at his  \"crispy\"duck, ANOTHER server comes over, and asks if we are done.

Yes.at that point we really were.

We did not tip.Consciously. Because I have worked in the food industry for many a year.I've been a waitress. And the food was ok ish, there was no. service. to.be.seen.Who were we supposed to tip?the waitress who sat us down?the one who took our order?Or maybe the one who forgot our drinks?Or maybe the one who brought out the duck before the rest of the food?

It was a big, confusing, rushed mess.

This used to be my fave Thai joint. It sucked."}
{"text":"Sooooo good!!! I had the drunken noodles and they were awesome! We took a group of 7 with a 2 year old and then split the check 5-ways -- the server was extremely accommodating! I know we asked for a lot and she delivered with a smile - awesome service! Awesome food!!"}
{"text":"Yupha's is my favorite Thai restaurant in the Phoenix metro. My husband and I have been coming here for 3 or 4 years now, and we've never had a bad meal or bad service. They have the most delicious Thai iced tea I've ever had. I usually order the chicken pad Thai because I love it so much, but I've also had the pad garlic sauce, drunken noodles, boat noodle, and yellow curry. The lunch menu also includes all you can eat soup and salad, which are both very good. We've been in for Valentine's Day and Mother's Day before, and they usually have nice special occasion menus."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for some time.  Then I found out that people from work go there on a regular basis.  So I joined them one day, and I am so glad that i did.  The food is amazing and the portions are huge.  I have only been in for lunch, but I look forward to come in for dinner with my family in the near future."}
{"text":"They have a great lunch menu and there's soup and salad that comes with it. I love the spring rolls and the Panang curry. The seating is pretty close quarters and at lunch time it does get pretty busy."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great atmosphere! Tastes as authentic as it can get around here. I have been to nearly every Thai restaurant in the east valley and this is my number one spot!

There's a curry without coconut milk, very spicy! That's my favorite dish there. A medium tastes Thai hot! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Excited to try out this location, arrived for a late lunch, greeted and treated well. Although, we didn't feel there was much of an actual dining process. Very little table service.  They have decent portions, although pricey and it's noted on the menu that sharing is not allowed? Flavors were good, but not impressive for a return visit."}
{"text":"Delicious food and good service! I finally made my way back for the curry puffs and cucumber salad, and I wasn't disappointed. The ambiance and location aren't ideal, but the unique food and friendly service are worth it. We haven't been in awhile, but my husband insisted we go back. I begrudgingly accepted, and I am completely delighted I did!"}
{"text":"The food is good and flavorful but the prices are out of line. A cup of soup here is $4.99 when it should be about $2.00. It consisted of broth, maybe 1 sliced up mushroom and 3 shrimp. Nothing to it at all. A bowl of soup is $10??  Prices need to be competitive. There are some great thai places around the area that give Yuphas a good competition... especially when prices are more reasonable as well."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful Thai restaurant in Mesa, AZ.  I enjoyed the Spring Rolls, Satay Chicken Skewers, and a Green Curry (Medium) with Pork.  

The restaurant itself is very busy.  The staff do their best in a rush and I have no complaints.  Great food amidst the bustle!"}
{"text":"Great place! One of my favorite's in the neighborhood and  place I always take friends who visit. I like the Pad Thai and the Green curry but I haven't been with anyone who didn't like what they got. Good for take out as well."}
{"text":"Drunken noodles are AMAZING!  It's the best anywhere.  Yupha is great also, always very nice and friendly, and she remembers my name every time I go!  Goodness...writing this review makes me crave it, cuz I haven't been in a while.

I'm cuttin' this one short....off to Yupha's!"}
{"text":"I want this Thai place near my house!!!!  We were on our way to the airport and I wanted Asian food.  I did a search for an Asian restaurant and found this place with great reviews. 

When we arrived, we were greeted with very friendly people and got seated right away and we ordered the following:
Spicy Beef Salad ($9) - excellent!  big pieces of tender juicy beef.  lots of veggies with crisp lettuce and the dressing was delicious!

Pad Woon Sen with Chicken ($10) - delicious!  Usually when I order this dish at the Thai restaurant near my house, the thin rice noodle is all broken and mushy.  However at this place, the thin rice noodle was perfectly cooked.  

Pork Jerky ($16) - this dish came with sticky rice and a small side salad.  Very good!!  

When I come back, I would order the same thing over and over again."}
{"text":"I'm picky about Asian food so this place was a surprising find.  Here's is my overall take:  

Food = 4 Stars
Service = 3.75 
Ambience = 3 Stars
Value = 3.75 Stars"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this Thai place! When my boyfriend and I are in the mood for Thai this is our go-to stop.  I absolutely love their drunken noodles and he is a big fan of their yellow curry.  We also never leave without getting dessert, usually the sticky rice with mango and/or the fried banana and ice cream. 

YUM I'M READY TO GO RIGHT NOW!!"}
{"text":"Still a very solid choice for Thai in the South Tempe / Chandler.

This time we tried a the pad woo sen, which their rendition of it was truly great with the fine noodles veggies and tofu. The one surprise is that this dish even came with rice even though it is a noodle dish. I do like it when they ask if egg is ok when ordering with tofu and veggies.

The panang curry we had was rich and full of spice, if you are not in to spicy this may not be the fish for you."}
{"text":"Lovely early Sunday evening Dinner.  The Seafood Hot Pot had a well balanced base of lime and chile, nice notes of lemongrass, mushroom and fresh basil.  Shrimp, mussels, squid and sea scallops well prepared  with adequate portions of each for this shared first course. I thoroughly enjoyed it! I selected the Shredded Green Papaya salad for my entree, nice presentation great flavors. I'd recommend both menu items."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic meal.  Simply outstanding.  I ordered the Red Curry with Shrimp.  I feel that many restaurants use shrimp that is just a \"place holder\".  Not Yupha's.  The shrimp itself was wonderfully flavorful as was the rest of the entree.  Wow.  What a great meal."}
{"text":"Their curry is fantastic. The drunken noodle and pad Thai tastes a bit off but seriously, go for the curry. You won't regret it. Have had the green yellow red and panang. Be careful of spice level for those who don't like spicy. Mild is enough for me and medium packs a punch."}
{"text":"We've tried different Thai restaurants, and we always come back to Yupha. It's a little pricier than some of the others, but it's definitely among the best.   My husband is a curry fan and says that Yupha's is superior to other resturants.  I love the Drunken Noodles and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"1 star for customer service. They really don't care about their customers. The food is amazing, service is atrocious. They can be down right rude. I went with a large group and someone ordered just an appetizer. The waitress pointed to each of us and said we can eat from the salad bar then pointed to the person who ordered an appetizer and said you cannot get anything from over there. It's just ridiculous how she had to single them out like that. On a separate occasion I asked for a container for the salad dressing. Instead of saying yes it will cost _ the waitress freaked out at the thought. There's been several occasions where they are just mean. The food is so good though. I think the service is worthless."}
{"text":"Loved to eat here until one of the waitresses aggressively and very rudely demanded if we left a tip on the table when we went up to the desk to pay.. First of all, we did not leave a tip at the table because we were going to leave it on our card  and Everytime I eat here I make sure to leave a tip Never have a I ever left with no tip. Second of all, just because this Thai restaurant is family owned, does not mean you can be rude to your customers. The audacity is unreal. Will not be returning here... It's a real shame.. Regulars and new comers beware."}
{"text":"When my family went to eat dinner on a Friday night, there were lots of people in the restaurant. It was a medium-large sized restaurant, and there was some wait time. We didn't mind, because there are couches inside near the cashier and some seating areas outside.

One of the first things I noticed about the restaurant were the modern Thai decorations. They had large photos hanging from the walls, as well as some Buddha decorations that went nicely with the overall atmosphere of the restaurant. 

Overall, there was friendly service, although the waitress could have been more attentive; she was nice but didn't check once until the end. To be fair, the restaurant was very busy and there was a water jug that we could fill our own waters with.

The noise level was a bit loud, but there were lots of people in the restaurant. I think we were seated near the kitchen, because there were busy waiters coming out; we constantly heard the clanking of dishes. It might have been quieter on other days and in other areas of the restaurant. 

I got the Massaman curry, which was good. It had a nice strong coconut flavor, and came with a choice of tofu or chicken and potatoes. My mom got the drunken noodles, which were good in small amounts but perhaps not so much in large quantities; the sauce was overbearing (quite salty). My sister got the pad thai, which I thought was the best out of the three dishes. I would recommend the pad thai. 

Overall, very satisfied. I feel like my experience would have been more amplified if the restaurant wasn't so busy, but I probably will come back again. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"We went along with our 1 year old and their service and behavior was the worst in our whole life. The waitresses were really annoyed to see our baby and they behaved as though some body died at their place. Our baby spilled some food on the tale and so they warned us that we shouldnt have taken so much salad and peanut sauce in the first place. I complained to the lady at the desk about the waitresses behavior and she did not care as much. Please avoid this restaurant as they lack courteous behavior."}
{"text":"I was meeting some high school friends after a long time and we decided to go for Thai food. The ambience was good and the food was good too. I ordered the Buddha Deligh (fried tofu). Loved it .Got the yellow curry which was awesome too. Would definitely recommend this place if you are in the area and want to eat thai food."}
{"text":"We just can't get enough Thai food lately, and Yupha's didn't disappoint.  We were there on a Friday at lunch time. The included salad and soup are modest, but a nice touch.  

I ordered Prihk King, medium. The flavor was right-on, but the spice level was WAY higher than a typical medium.  The chicken and vegetables in the dish were fresh and tasty, not over or under-cooked.  Also at the table was the red curry, which was pretty standard, but very good.  That was ordered medium as well, and came out at a more expected spiciness.

Service was prompt and friendly.  It was a great deal at $22 for two...would have been $17 without our two frosty Thai iced teas!"}
{"text":"Service and food were both subpar. Thai iced tea had way too much cream in it. The pad thai had very little flavor and had way more crushed nuts and bean sprouts than the chicken I had ordered to go in it. This place is one of the cheaper Thai places in town, but remember, you get what you pay for. If you're in the east valley and craving Thai, try Mint Thai on Gilbert Road instead of this place."}
{"text":"Best Thai place in Tempe. Great food, nice staff, and a nice atmosphere. I love this place and eat there all the time. Very vegetarian friendly. I recommend the papaya salad and pad pak."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Not much to say that hasn't already been said about this place, but I'd start with the Thai Coffee and end with any of the dishes, because they've all got something to offer. I made the mistake of getting pad Thai the first time and although it was really good, it wasn't the star of the show (is it ever though?) 
I love the peanut dressing at the salad bar and add it to everything because it's so freaking good! 
This place gets busy for lunch even on the weekdays, so prepare for a small wait."}
{"text":"I had to give this place five stars b/c I thought the food was excellent and I had one of my best fried rices ever.  I like spice in my food so I ordered all of my dishes as medium and it was exactly the amount of spice I wanted.  We started with the Yum ped - a crispy duck salad, and it was tasty.  I had the beef fried rice and it was superb and I couldn't stop eating it.  My husband got the Thai jerky - hot - and while he liked it, he thought the beef was a a little too crispy and took away from the flavor a little bit.  He did think that my fried rice was quite tasty, however.

We topped off the meal with fried banana with coconut ice cream - it was a dream dessert!  

Excellent Thai food and their spice levels are dead on!"}
{"text":"The Best Thai Food I have ever had. So good! If your going for lunch make sure you go early because by noon they are packed!"}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few Thai places in the valley, and this one wins as #1! The place is clean, the people are nice, and the food is delicious! I also love that when I ask for spicy, it really is spicy and they aren't just humoring me."}
{"text":"Yes it's a good Thai Restaurant. It has good Lunch Specials and have Complementary Salad with Peanut Dressing and Soup with Celery, Cabbage and Lettuce ,etc. and you can take second serving of both.Today Penang Curry (Tofu, Beans, Red Bell Peppers ,Green Peppers and Curry was at 9.99 inclusive of Steamed Rice. It was worth it with Salad and Soup. Theu have gorgeous walls and wall decor with Buddha Pictures. Good One !"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food! 
We enjoyed the -

Pad Thai veggie : 4 star excellent taste and texture!
Drunken noodles chicken : 5 star- incredible flavor!
Red curry chicken: 5 star very good!
Green curry pork 4 star yum!! 

If I lived here it would be my go-to Thai place!!!

Keep up the good work !"}
{"text":"Quality has gone downhill recently. I used to love this place and came here once a week, but two of my coworkers have gotten really sick after eating here."}
{"text":"Granted I should have checked what time they close....so we sat down and were told  that we needed to hurry  up and order because we close at 9.... we walked in at 8:30.   Our appetizers  and entrée  came at same time....the food was good...but we were rushed ...so not sure how soon I will return...PS walked out at 9 pm.  This is sad because it was the first time I have been to Yapha."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!! This place is my go to for curry, I like to get the yellow curry. Love the atmosphere the staff are very friendly and nice. Overall great experience and will be going back to get more of their yummy food"}
{"text":"So we came here again and tried new dishes. Started with the sampler and our favorite was the golden curry puff, but everything on it was great. We ordered Panang Curry and the Basil Fried Rice. They were both exceptional!"}
{"text":"Came in here for a post half-marathon meal with a couple of friends. They told me that since it was a Sunday, we had to go to Yupha's since Yupha had great Sunday Specials [or great lunch specials in general].

One of the perks of having gone the day that we did was that their soup and their salad for lunch were all you can you eat [or at least they didn't hint at any restrictions - I still only went for one round]. What was great about the salad is their peanut sauce/dressing - SOOOO DELICIOUS!!

I got their chicken red curry, one friend got their chicken green curry, and another got their duck red curry. All of the dishes were of generous portions and extremely flavorful. The texture in the chicken was not tough and not overdone as it often can be in curries. There were ample ingredients in the curry to complement the rice. I was extremely satisfied with my selection, and from the looks of the empty plates from my friends, they were extremely happy with their selections as well.

The service was really nice, although one of the servers were not as proficient in his English and misunderstood a few of the things that were said. The staff all made us feel very welcome, making this place an absolute consideration to dine at the next time I'm in the area [I'm from Cali..]

If you want ample portions, good flavor, good pricing, and a friendly service, Yupha will NOT disappoint."}
{"text":"Today I'm a little mixed about how I feel about this place. Yes, I was that pain in the ass customer that strolled in at 2:33 pm when the places closes at 3pm daily, BUT...that's no excuse for a little bit of discouraging my son and I from coming in to eat. The hostess/waitress immediately advised us that the kitchen closes in 10 minutes. If this is the case, why don't they close at 2:00 or 2:30 pm daily???? We then sat down and were approached with menus and for our drink order. I knew what I wanted so I ordered my drinks and food right away since I was feeling rushed.   This was the time that the staff eat their lunch as they gathered around for break. The waitress was as polite as possible but being rushed is EXTREMELY rude!!!! She brought my check in the middle of enjoying my rushed meal, which was somewhat understandable. I then asked for to-go containers and she responded by reassuring me not to rush. (By this time I'm thinking she's only being courteous to receive a decent tip for \"puting up\" with me!) She even had the nerve to remind me, as my son was finishing up his last bites, that they have to lock the door at three (translation: Get the hell out!!!!) I WILL NEVER BE BACK AND I WILL TELL ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY ABOUT MY CRAPPY EXPERIENCE! It's too bad because the food is outstanding!"}
{"text":"This was one of the first places I ate after moving to Phoenix, and I must say I was impressed.  Slightly overpriced, but delicious none-the-less. I've never eaten in the restaurant, only ordered take-out so I cannot comment on the service (hence 4 stars).

For all you fans out there....the map does not show the correct location for the store.  It used to be near the Wal-Mart off Elliot and I-10, but has since moved to 1805 East Elliot Road #115, off McClintock and Elliot."}
{"text":"Okay - I am all in with 5 stars. I haven't been here for a long time because we moved out of state. Every place I tried was always held to the Yupha's standard and always failed. Now that we moved back to the area, we went to Yupha's and I was really hoping it would be as good as I remembered. It wasn't. IT WAS BETTER! Their Drunken noodles is my favorite and their Pad Thai is spot on. We tried the Crispy Mermaids as an appetizer. Yum! The surprise to me was their Boat Noodle Soup. I am not a big soup fan, but the hubby got it. It was amazing!! If you haven't been here, you must go! Also the service was very good too!"}
{"text":"Yupha's was featured on CHECK PLEASE, ARIZONA (great show on PBS) and we love this restaurant! This is our \"spicy Thai\" restaurant, and it never disappoints! Recommended: the papaya salad and the Pahd See Ew... both are better, and different, than I've had anywhere else. You can't go wrong with whatever delicious specials their chefs have created each day, and their teas and desserts are always wonderful too. AND, even better, they are just doors down from the Tempe Cinema's (the Tempe $3 movie theater), so you can have a gourmet dinner followed by a movie just steps away. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Came with a partner to dinner after a show. We have the Seafood Sampler and the Panang Fried Rice special. I must say that we were not disappointed in any way. Wonderful food and great presentation.  Add the great prices and reasonable drink prices, you have a great go to Thai place."}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to go if you like Thai food or would like to try it for the first time. The ambiance is casual, inviting and fun. I like that their decor is tasteful and not overly frilly.  The wait staff is friendly, when they are available. I have to say, this place is not where you'd go for a \"quick bite\". Even for lunch, expect to be there at least an hour. It's usually very packed. 

Price-wise, it's not overly expensive here, but it's definitely not a cheap Thai joint either. If you go for lunch, the lunch menu ranges from $5.99 (just Soup & Salad) to Seafood dishes at $12.99. If you order lunch, you get free self-serve soup & salad. I really enjoy the hot peanut sauce for the salad and the soup is very light. It may throw some people off that the soup is rather bland but it's an appetizer. I'm sure if it's too tasty, people would just keep helping themselves to the complimentary Soup & Salad bar. 

Some of my favorite dishes are: Pad See Ew (usually with beef), Chicken Pad Thai & the Yupha's Fried Rice. Their curry dishes are also YuMmMMmy!!! I really need to try other things since I keep alternating between those. I always wondered why their food tastes sooo good then realized it's because they tend to make their food a bit sweeter than some places. I'm not complaining since I have a sweet tooth! The only disappointment I ever experienced here was their Seafood soup. I've had really good Seafood soup elsewhere and was sure this place would rock.. only to be so let down. Their broth was extremely limey and sour, lacking any other flavors. Thankfully I only ordered a small bowl of it and not a huge one. Aside from that, everything I've had there is fantastic! 

For dessert, I've had their sticky rice with mango which was delicious since the mango was in season. I'd really like to try their Homemade coconut ice cream next time I go! I love that stuff!

Aside from the slow service and their nasty Seafood soup, I really love this place!"}
{"text":"The new location is big, open, and a bit more like a dinner spot rather than a mish-mosh diner. But that's just aesthetics, I realize.

The food is great. I had the pad thai and tried one of the duck dishes. I'm not a huge fan of duck, but this was nice and tender and the sauce was amazing. Whatever sauce it had on it was composed of peppers, mushrooms and ground pork, if that helps you find it on the menu. The drunken dragon is also fabulous, and at $7 for lunch and $10 for dinner, Yupha's a steal. I just finished the other half of my pad thai a minute ago. Yum.

I think it's my favorite Thai in the greater campus area, but then I thought about it and, isn't most of the good food in the Phoenix area in the Tempe area? I think so. 

Anyway, Yupha is one cool lady and you can tell they're trying hard with this grand opening. A little ass-kissing is nice, but then again, places like these are for regulars, so I guess they don't have to be overly nice to me. I'm just here to grub.

EAT HERE. And ask for twice the spicy you would normally. The medium is not spicy and the thai hot is medium."}
{"text":"The food was ok spicy was not spicy and the Thai tea was a bit to sweet but all in all not bad. The service was a completely different story! I haven't had service this bad in a long time. The waitress came over asked us if we had been there before we said no and she just walked away it took another 10 minutes before she came back by and took our orders didn't answer any questions seemed bothered by our order. Another waiter brought our food and drinks and we didn't see the waitress again until she dropped the check and left without a word. We waited about ten mins to pay and finally gave up and went to the front to pay we complained but they didn't really address our concerns. I won't return because I felt like my business was more of a bother"}
{"text":"We just happened to be next to this restaurant and the thought of Thai food sounded delectable.  After checking yelp and seeing all of the good reviews we decided to give this place a try.  We had our 5 year old daughter with us and I was very surprised to see a kids menu.  Not only that, but when they brought us our water they brought her a small kids cup of water with a lid on it! Very thoughtful and I was quite surprised.  We started with their Thai spring rolls which were delicious and the hubby ordered the much talked about drunken noodles with beef and I had the yellow curry with chicken, \"a little bit spicy.\"  My daughter enjoyed the corn dog and french fries.
The hubby loved his drunken noodles and was cautioned by the waitress that they are VERY filling.  She was not exaggerating.  I also found the yellow curry to be quite filling and extremely delicious.
If you are in the area and have the hankering for an extremely yummy Thai restaurant you just have to stop at Yupha's.  It was one we will remember and return to again in the near future."}
{"text":"Amazing thai place in Tempe. Decent ambience, great quality food. 

Ordered -
Tom Kha Soup (veggies) : tasted delicious and was interestingly served in a container with burner. Totally loved it.
Green Curry (veggies) : Super huge quantity for a meal. Yummy and spices were perfect. 
Thai Rolls: what great can you expect from a spring roll?? It's just like any other place but dipping sauce was delicious.

Would love to try this place again and again."}
{"text":"Love the food, but not the signs. You have a beautiful restaurant. Remove all the tacky laser printed signs plastering your windows. It's tell everyone you have a problem and \"nags\" at them. Also the buffet sign/poster over the back table, ditto.
Remove that also, signs in bathroom. Enough said. Keep it simple.
We all get tired of saying the same thing, but putting up a sign, tells 
EVERYONE YOU HAVE a problem DOING YOUR JOB!
The food is marvelous--bring back the ambiance please."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I live in San Francisco, but visit my family near this place often. It is now a requirement that we eat here. Yum yum!! Over the weekend my family and I ordered multiple dishes to share for pick up, no one could decide which one they liked better because they were all more tasty than the next! We eat a lot of Thai in San Francisco, but we have never ate anywhere that had such flavor. This place is definitely my favorite, better than actual Thai restaurants in Thailand! I love the yupha seafood special, perfect flavors. Also the Tom kha gai soup is outstanding, the flavors are insane!! Every curry was perfect and the Pad Thai was so flavorful. Much more flavors here than anywhere. Eat here!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant of all time! 

Their Pad Thai is the best I've tried. I like to get their Red Curry and other noodle dishes as well. 

Watch out for their spicy level. If you want mild, you should get level 2."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good way to clear your sinuses, I suggest heading to Yupha's Thai Kitchen in Tempe. The heat in the delicious food should have you breathing clearly in no time.

The spot is intimate and cozy and a great date place, despite its strip mall location. It has pretty artwork on the walls, and it's quiet enough to where it's easy to have a great conversation. The food there is some of the best Thai food I've had, and my companion said he's still dreaming about the meal he had there.

He started off with the Little Mermaid ($5), which is shrimp and bacon wrapped in a spring roll. The faces he was making while eating this said it all: they were great.

For my meal, I went with my favorite Thai dish, the Red Curry ($10.95). I got a medium heat, which was wayyyy too hot for my sensitive palate. I would recommend going with the least amount of heat possible, especially if you're new to Thai food, because the heat always tends to be way hotter than you anticipate.

I got my meal with brown rice, and combining the two was just heavenly. It's one of my favorite meals ever, and because it's mostly vegetables, it's relatively healthy. The service at Yupha's was also really friendly and attentive. If you're in the area, it's definitely worth stopping there for a bite."}
{"text":"Great place for Crispy Duck, one of my all time favorite dishes. Any of the panang curries are excellent as well. I recommend coming in before 630 as the dinner rush can be quite intense."}
{"text":"Was vacationing in Arizona for the first time and my brother took us to this restaurant. Recently took a vacation in Thailand and Yupha's Thai Kitchen is better tasting than any Thai food I had in Thailand. This place was so good that I went here twice during my time in Arizona.

Their lunch special includes unlimited soup and salad."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for good Thai food, and let me tell you this is GREAT Thai food. The service was great, the pad see ew amazing, and the Thai tea was perfection. If you want an authentic Thai meal in the valley, this is the place to be. 

p.s. I want those wood Buddha wall hangings :)"}
{"text":"Favorite Thai restaurant!  Love the pad Thai and all of their curry. Great lunch special also! :)"}
{"text":"I relocated to the Phoenix area about 3 months ago. I have been to about a dozen Thai restaurants in that time searching for great Pad Thai. This is the only one so far that even deserves to be rated and I know my Pad Thai. Theirs is perfect. Fresh ingredients and reasonably priced for a quick lunch. Tasted like I hoped. Real authentic Pad Thai."}
{"text":"I haven't tried anything here that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. Great job - keep up the good quality!"}
{"text":"I must say, this place deserved 5 stars a couple of years ago but the food quality and serving size have deteriorated. Still a good Thai place but definitely not the best in the valley IMHO"}
{"text":"One of our absolute favorites. Highly recommend their Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, Drunken Noodles, Hot and Sour Soup, and Tom Yum!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I'm putting 3 stars because of the experience. Every time I go, they rush me through dinner. I see them doing this all the time. If you get there an hour before closing, they start turning off the music, doing \"last call\" for desert way to early, rushing with plates/bill. Just an aura of GTFO. I'm not picky with service, so this is really saying something if I feel this way. it's just so off putting that I've just been getting take out. It's like they think they turn into a pumpkin like Cinderella at closing.  So def come no earlier than 1.5 hours to closing."}
{"text":"Not only is the food the most authentic we've found in The Valley, it's apparent that the establishment is run with professionalism and care.  There is a lot of attention paid to the dining customers and the staff is efficient and friendly.  It also apparent that the owner/manager has a vested interest in serving good food and providing good service AND that her staff is trained to pay attention to details from the kitchen to the tabletops and everywhere in between."}
{"text":"I somehow randomly drove past this place after attending a race event at Firebird and decided to give it a go. I was totally blown away! The food was made even more delicious by the luck of running across such a wonderful place. The decor is great, the open-ness of the room makes for a comfortable dining experience and the colors are vibrant without being too busy. The artwork was fun to look at while we waited for our food to arrive.

I ordered pad se ew with chicken (my mainstay Thai dish) and had wild berry tea as a beverage. The tea was amazing, with fresh berries added which gave it a natural flavor as well as a lovely snack once I was finished with the drink. My husband ordered drunken noodle, Thai spicy and it was definitely just that. My pad se ew was cooked perfectly. The noodles looked like they were made in-house and the black soy sauce was a perfect mix of salty with a bit of sweetness. The broccoli and chicken were all cooked perfectly and there was a nice balance of all three ingredients. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about Thai food and gave very good recommendations. If I even find myself in the Phoenix area again I will definitely be making a return visit."}
{"text":"I've got a friend who loves this place: everytime we go there, I wonder why.  I'll grant that the place seems clean and the staff are friendly enough.  However....

1.  Not spicy enough...ever.  It doesn't seem to matter how I instruct the server, my food always comes out at \"slightly above frozen General Tsao's Chicken\" level.  It's as if they're rationing chiles there.

2.  Ridiculous payment policy.  Seriously, how shortsighted a business decision is it to refuse to split checks?  I go out with a group of 4-5 other poor students.  There's no way any of us is in the position to pretend to be a Rockefeller and buy lunch for the whole table.  This is just a dumb policy."}
{"text":"Nothing too special.  Decent Thai food at a good price.  I was disappointed in the Tom Kah soup, as it wasn't really served or even tasted quite like the way I'm used to it, and it's usually my favorite thing on a Thai menu.
The bigger downside was slow, though friendly, service.   I couldn't tell if they were understaffed because all the girls serving and busing looked the same to me, honestly, so that may have been the problem, or I might just be kinda racist.

Worst of all, perhaps particular to our experience or the product of popularity and layout, was the noisy couples surrounding us.  It was hard NOT to hear their conversation even over the noise of eating our own meals, and it made my dinner mate and me oddly self conscious and uncomfortably aware of a lack of privacy for our own conversation.

So yeah, two stars.  Sorry, nothing personal, just overrated."}
{"text":"Last time I came my boyfriend ordered the Pra Ram and it was so good! We decided to come back so I can order it and this time I was so disappointed. The dish was just drenched in peanut sauce.. I tried to pick the chicken off to eat but even that was gross."}
{"text":"It was my first time. I decided to try it out with my
Mom because of their reviews on Yelp. Hmmm... my thoughts, alright. I've had better Thai food somewhere else with better prices. Their salad bar isn't all that great and their lunch prices eh, not the best either. I think our total bill was 25.00 for lunch, which I can go to another Thai place and pay half that price. However, their peanut sauce was really good and their restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite thai restaurant of all time. The food is always delicious and consistent. I've never actually had a bad experience here, and i've been there over 50 times.

I've tried several items on the menu, but tend to go back to the Tom Kha Gai and Pad Khing Sod. The yellow curry is good also."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been frequent pick-up customers for last 3 years. Sam at the front is AMAZING. When we dine-in the service is always friendly and prompt... And the food is the best Thai cuisine I have experienced!!! You cannot make a bad selection on the menu...and we have tried almost every item. Cannot recommend this place enough!!! :)"}
{"text":"Seriously, this is the best Thai food I have ever had. It is by far my favorite place to get take out from on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I was introduced to Yuphas by my boyfriend who has been going here for years, and it's his favorite too, but it's gotten to the point where I want it three times a week and he's wishing he had never taken me there!  

I am such a creature of habit, I always get the pad Thai because it is so delicious, my boyfriend is the same way. He gets the drunken noodles- at least I still pretend to look at the menu before I make my decision. 

Also I should note, Yuphas is great to dine in too, everyone is super friendly and the service is awesome, but there just something special about eating delicious Thai food in your sweat pants on your couch, watching a movie."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service and nice ambience. We went there on a Thursday night and the restaurant was consistently full the time we are there. Definitely check out if you love Thai. Green curry is amazing!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner the other night with a group I am in.    Ordered their yellow curry, hot, not Thai hot but hot.   Perfecto hotness.   At first, I thought the chicken was boiled.   UGHHHH!    I don't like boiled chicken.   After having it the next day, it wasn't so bad.   I wish they would put more than just huge chunks of potatoes and onions in it, maybe something that would give it a little color contrast??   Oh, well.   The sauce is the best part and I enjoyed the flavoring.  Would I return?    I have had curry chicken at other Thai restaurants where I don't have to ponder whether the chicken is boiled and make a conclusion later."}
{"text":"The best Thai restaurant in the SE area of Phoenix.
Better than Chon Thai, Swaddee, Thai Basil, Thai Rama, Thai Paradise, and Thailicious. I have tried all of these places....."}
{"text":"Wow what a deal! My $8.50 Pad Thai lunch included the soup and salad bar. And the food was delicious, the service was good, and the atmosphere is nice. Great Thai food in Tempe!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai food I've ever had. From the outside, it doesn't look like anything special, as it's in a strip mall. Inside, it has typical Asian themed decor. It's very clean, unlike a lot of other Thai places. The server was very friendly and refilled our waters several times.

I had the red curry. They brought it out very quickly, which was nice during lunch since we had a limited amount of time. It was a huge portion for the price. The chicken was lean and had no gristle. The veggies were clearly fresh as well as the curry sauce. It had a great kick to it, which I love. The sticky rice was great, as well as the egg roll. When you order an entree, you get unlimited trips to their salad bar and soup.

Overall, this place was great."}
{"text":"This is one of four of my favorite Thai restaurants in the valley, and the first! She used to be near Priest/Elliot years ago, and I ate there most workdays. I've eaten at the present location several times as well. Top flight Thai food! Super fresh, excellent presentation, nice staff. A must try if you're looking for Thai in the East Valley."}
{"text":"I order papaya salad which is my favorite dish in Thai restaurant. Thai fired rice is good. The green curry is just fine. However my boyfriend said it's the same flavor as the one I bought from Asian supermarket. (And when he went to use the restroom, he found out they had lots of curry sauce cans which was the same one I used for cooking green curry at home) The sticky rice mango is worth to try!"}
{"text":"Woot!  I have found Chicago level good Thai food in AZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I am giving Yupha's Thai Kitchen the crown for AZ's BEST Thai food-hands down!  I was elated to see they had beef and pork Thai style jerky on their menu.  Folks, this is the real deal...it might sound weird but it is amazingly good....just as good as the street food I used to get at the Thai Buddhist Temple's Sunday Markets.  It brought tears of joy to my eyes.  I will drive the two hours to Tempe any day for this dish!

The inside of this place is unlike any other Thai restaurant is no small, dingy, typical hole in the wall kind of place.  It is hip, modern and elegant (in a relaxed, non intrusive way).  The plates are white and square...the placemats are bamboo like...they even plate the food!  

The beef jerky was cooked perfectly!  The sauce was dazzling- it is like a Thai waterfall sauce with lovely notes of lime and chili.  The sticky rice was presented in a banana leaf....the papaya salad was great and you could tell, they made it with a mortar and pastel-the proper way.  

I also tried the Thai Toast, which was a special of the day...it was not much to write home about.  Minced chicken inside of panko crusted fried bread.  The sweet chili peanut dipping sauce was quite good.

One diner stole the show, when his dish arrived wrapped in tin foil that was shaped like a swan...I am guessing it must have been the duck (they have duck served 4 different ways here)...yes, it is cheesy....but kinda cool at the same time.  I saw at least 4 tables ask their servers, what he was having.

I wish more places offered Thai style jerky!  Now if I could just get some mee krob on the menu, I would be in total nirvana.   No room left for desert, but they had some nice offerings for sure...I rarely can turn down a Thai style fried banana with the tasty sesame seeds in the batter.....yuuuuummm."}
{"text":"I love this place, hands down the best Thai food in Tempe! Their green curry is a perfect blend of flavor and spiciness. The ambiance is adorable, it is a great place for a date! You can have most dishes made gluten free, which is fantastic! Don't forget to ask for brown rice, so much tastier and healthier than white rice!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Large menu - not cheap, but not expensive. They do a big takeout business, a good sign. 1st time here so we tried the app sampler which was fine but not stellar. We had the green mango salad, which is usually one of my favorites, would taste better with ground peanuts. We had the drunken noodles w shrimp. Lots of veggies and shrimp, a little more noodles maybe. The red curry w chicken was our favorite. We ordered it mild as my husband doesn't like really spicy food. It could have been a little hotter, but that was our fault. It was very good. We will be back to discover their best dishes as they have real potential ! Very quiet.   Not very busy on a Tuesday during a rain/monsoon storm. Wine and beer available."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, beautiful and the music is calming.  The appetizer I tried was the crispy mermaid, it was delicious. Bacon wrapped shrimp wrapped in a spring roll cover, it's amazing.

I can't remember the name of my entrée, but it was number 303 on the menu, a garlic dish with shrimp, the best choice for me since I love both garlic and shrimp.

For a drink I chose the jasmine hot tea.  To be honest it wasn't the best choice.  Otherwise the whole experience was great.

We tried a few desserts, the mango one was good, the hot and cold combo was interesting.  The coconut and Thai tea icecream was good, I'm not a fan of coconut but everyone else enjoyed it.  My favorite was the fried Icecream.  Vanilla icecream breaded, frozen then fried, and flambéed at the table with rum.  Some honey was drizzled over it, I'm not a fan of honey either but I loved the dish so much it didn't matter.

One of them best Asian food places ever."}
{"text":"Went here last night after catching a noir at the Pollock Theater next door. I ordered the yellow curry w/rice and the Thai iced tea. The food was great, staff was ok....but they are extremely stingy with portion sizes on the rice and the tea. I was shocked when my tea came, I was expecting a big huge glass of yummy Thai tea like most places give you and what I got was a tiny ice cream sundae style glass with a LOT of ice. I'd say my actual tea was about 10 oz, for $2.75 and no refills! The curry was a good portion however they gave me a tiny little bowl of rice and I had to ask for a second serving, which costs an extra $1.50...lame. Anyways, good tasting tea & curry...bad on the portion sizes for tea & rice!"}
{"text":"Tried out this place for the first time.  I got the drunken noodles and the Thai fried rice. Wow is all I can say, but the service was just ok that's why I'm giving them a 4 star."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the best Thai food in Arizona. Chicken pad Thai is the way to go. Seriously the best! Don't go anywhere else then here."}
{"text":"You should not pass this place by. Best Tai in the Valley! Perfectly customized heat. Wonderful vegetarian options. The vegetables and tofu in my Red Curry were fabulous...the flavors just explode. I will be back often."}
{"text":"food, service, ambience .. superb!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Visited 2 times here and both the times treated differently compared to other guests. Second time asked the server that is there any issue and she rudely replied we are busy. And I can literally see the behavior with other guests which is completely different. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Let me just start out by saying I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place. I've only eaten here twice, but the food is just amazing, if not magical. When I come here, I'm looking to especially treat and spoil myself for all the hard work I've done, (when and if I've done any). Now, I've never been to Thailand, or Asia for that matter. But I've eaten at many Thai restaurants because I love the cuisine, but eating here makes me feel like whoever created this menu, was looking to make it not only special, but something worthy of say a Mother's Day, or a special occasion. A memorable meal to go along with good times.

     Of course everyone knows, there are a few ingredients that are a big part of Thai food. Peanuts, which many people are, or think they are, allergic to. If you're one of those, sorry, you are just missing out. Coconut and curry also have major roles. I happen to love all those favors, so this food is like a paradise for me.

     The food is plated with care, and presentation is always observed, not just slopped on the plate. The food is delicious, and beautiful. I love the sticky rice and the rice that comes with the meal, it has many absorbing capabilities for the sauces. Also, their heat scale is not hot heavy like some places, and if you ask for a 2, it's a 2. You can always add all the chili oil you want if it's not hot enough, which I did both times.

     I didn't know I liked coconut ice cream, but I sure did! It was delicious and was much like normal vanilla except lighter tasting, which I did not expect. I also ordered the sticky rice with it, which I think my sever thought was nuts, maybe a little overkill there but hey! I'm a pro! They also have a flaming fried ice cream dessert for a real special occasion. It looked incredible. I saw one being delivered to a table for a birthday while I was there. I must admit, I felt a little peanut butter and jealous, but I'm not narcissistic enough to order myself one, not even on my birthday.

     The only tiny negative, which really isn't, and not really their fault, is that it's in a strip mall, so it's kind of...well...strip mallish. Kind of small, concrete floors, etc. In reality, this place is worthy of its own palace, This is not just the best Thai food I've ever had, but it's also the best fare in the whole area, and I've worked around there for 10 years. It's a tad pricey, but not really when you consider how important it is when you want to really treat yourself. I'm sure, I'll have a craving for this place again sooner or later."}
{"text":"Read reviews on yelp before deciding I wanted to order from here.. I was down in Tempe and placed an order to go. I was missing some really yummy thai food as I just moved to Phoenix and ordered chicken drunken noodles and beef panang curry, both medium spicy. Food was made relatively quickly after ordering and the restaurant was a cute little spot within a strip mall.  The food was relatively spicy but very flavorful. I think I may need to order the mild next time to get the maximum flavor of the dishes. I'm glad to have found some good thai food but too far it's all the way in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly impressed with this thai place! Needed a quick bite late on a Friday & they didnt disappoint. Great pad thai, panang was ok & the curry puffs were very fresh but nothing special like the rest of the reviews. Service was fine, very nice servers but nothing that stuck out, although it was great they bring a carafe of whatever your drinking. Would visit again"}
{"text":"I am picky about my Thai food, and most places that I go to don't quite hit the mark. Yupha's far exceeds it. I discovered this place recently and I've ordered from there 5 times in the last week. Their curries are so good. They are full-flavored and creamy, with great depth to the spices they use. I am also very sensitive to what I eat, and I never feel unwell after I eat here, which says a lot. 

Their lunch buffet is wonderful.They have vegetable soup and salad with peanut dressing, and you can have as much as you like. For dinner, their entrees are quite large, so you can easily have leftovers for the next day. The prices are very reasonable too. Great place."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in town. Delicious foods and desserts if you have room (I always order desserts first). Pad Thai, Pad See Eww, Tom Yum Soup, and their lunch salads (all you can eat) with the delicious peanuts sauce. 

I have been coming here for years, and I still love it."}
{"text":"mild pad thai not so mild, more like working out and sweat hot. other than that, the food was decent."}
{"text":"After living in Thailand for a while and feasting for pennies, it gets painful to pay American prices for Thai cuisine unless it's top notch. Yupha's really hits that notch. The food is authentic except for the spice rating. Mild at Yupha's can be bland compared to the intensity that was considered mild over there. 

The environment is really pleasant and it's one of the few Thai places  where the staff actually indulge my poor Thai language skills with enthusiasm and a smile."}
{"text":"My favorite place in the valley for authentic Thai food. I can order \"Thai hot\" and actually feel the heat in the dish rather than other places that consider a mild-medium to be \"Thai hot\". I've had most of their dishes there and EVERYTHING was amazing. Lunch deals are awesome with the soup and salad bar (although sometimes crowded).

Give this place a try if you want some REAL Thai food!"}
{"text":"When my office moved from its other location, I thought that was the end of my Thai food for lunch, since the place I used to go to is now on the other side of town, but a friend told me about Yupha's right up the street from, so I thought it was time to go investigate! Grabbed a couple of coworker/friends and off we went!

We arrived little after 12; we were a party of 3 and were seated right away. After I sat down, I looked around and thought this is a really cute place, I like how its set up and how the lights hang and the art on the walls, and how tables are divided by bamboo, I liked the place just by site now.

Now I was looking at the lunch menu, soo many choices to pick from, I had been craving Pad Thai forever, so for this trip that's what I ordered, the Pad Thai lunch special, and some Thai Tea. With the lunch special it came with soup and salad, and the soup and salad are all you can eat, wow that's cool, because the lunch special price was like $7.99, that's a bangin good deal!

The salad was good, but what made it great was the spicy peanut sauce they have for the dressing, OHHHH MMMYYY GAWD!! That stuff is amazing, I think next time I'll have less salad and more sauce , I know, that's bad, but it's that good, and the soup, that's great tasting soup, it's a vegetable soup, but extremely clear broth, so tasty! Glad I gave it a try, because I'm not really a soup person.

Ok when I ordered my lunch, the waitress asked what spicy level would I want it, I was thinking of playing it safe since this was my 1st time there and I was unsure, and she told they have different levels, no spice, mild, medium, hot, Thai Hot, Double Hot and Triple Hot, and I thought to myself, if they have a double hot & Triple hot, then Im going to start at Thai Hot and that's what I did baby!  It was packing heat, but I think next time I will give the Double or Triple hot a try! The dish was perfect!! The entire lunch was very delish!

I look forward to making this a regular lunch time spot for me and to trying their entire lunch menu to find me a favorite! I think next I'll try there Red Curry!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai Fried Rice. I just wish the portions were a little bigger for the money."}
{"text":"I've ordered the yellow curry dish (to-go order) twice now. The container they put the yellow curry in, is never filled to the top...it's only filled about 3/4 full.  This is why I'm giving it 2 stars. I'm very disappointed in the stinginess of the serving, and since this happened to me twice now, I will look elsewhere for Thai food."}
{"text":"This is, by far, the best Thai restaurant we've been to in Arizona so far!  We went on a Sunday around 1pm and they were not busy at all.  Maybe 4 or 5 tables of people.  They offer their lunch specials...even on weekends, which was great.  All you can eat soup and salad bar comes with the lunch specials too!  I ordered the pad see ew with tofu, medium spicy, and the bf got the fried rice with tofu, hot.  Then we headed to the soup and salad bar.  The salad was not your typical iceberg lettuce, but a great mix of kale and cabbage, and maybe some lettuce too.  There were cucumbers, carrots, tomatoes, red onion and green onions to add to your liking and a peanut dressing that was super yummy!  The soup was a vegetable soup that was broth with diced veggies in it.  I was barely 2 bites into my salad when our entrees arrived!  I snuck a taste of my noodles, before finishing my salad and soup, and then devoured my pad see ew.  It was just wonderful!  Perfect heat level for me, not oily and super flavorful!  The bf LOVED his rice too!  Said he could easily eat it everyday.  Everything tasted so fresh!  They even had Kiltlifter beer.  We have found our new go to Thai place!"}
{"text":"Yupha's... I love the idea of this place.  It's nicely arranged and decorated and the staff is friendly.  They also feature animal cruelty free soaps and lotions in their nice bathrooms.  The problem is, when I go, which has been 3 times now, I only like one of the 50% of the food that is ordered.  That which I do like though, is pretty good.  It's just kinda hit and miss for finding something that I'll like.  

It'd be the kinda place to go if you find one dish and just stick with it maybe.  For me for now though... I think I'll keep looking for my favorite neighborhood Thai.  I'd still easily go if friends wanna meet there though.

Possibly see ya there."}
{"text":"Love eating here for lunch!! Love the Tom Yum Gai and Pad Gra Pow!  You can get it at any spice level but we love it Thai hot!  My son loves their Chai ice tea as well.  Great service and great atmosphere, very friendly."}
{"text":"Yupha's used to be one of my favorite Thai places when I lived in the Valley. A friend and I happened to be in Tempe during a recent visit back to Phoenix and I suggested lunch at Yupha's based on my memories. It was just OK And there are LOTS of other options out there..."}
{"text":"We are lucky to live so close to this place!  I guess I'm more easygoing than some diners who posted before me.  We really don't care how many waiters/waitresses we have, as long as the service is attentive - and it always has been. So, yes, at busier times you may not have the same person wait on you.  We tip on the overall experience/attentiveness.

Our food has been consistently good/great over the 20+ times we've eaten here - take out or dine in. 

A friend of ours who vacationed in Thailand more than once and came with us to eat here said the food was very on par in quality with what she ate in Thailand (including home-cooked meals there). The only difference is the hottest spiciness level may still be below what's served regularly in Thailand.  

Thanks Yupha's for doing what you do. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I have been to Yupha's twice now with the #ThaiThursday crew.  I have liked the two different dishes I have tried.  Don't even ask me to get the names right.  I have ordered by number both times.  The first was a noodle dish with shrimp and the second is the fried rice which I get with extra veggies.  I have gotten both dishes medium heat, they let you choose, and both times the top of my head has started sweating so consider yourself duelly warned.  The fried rice is really good and the portion is huge.  I, of course, eat every last grain on my plate and leave fully satiated.  It comes with a small spring roll and a soup and salad bar are included in the price of lunch.  The warm peanut dressing for the salad is really good.  

Give the place a try if you are nearby for lunch.  The service is super fast too."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I've been here four times-3 during lunch and once during their dinner hours. The prices are good, food is upmost quality, service is amazing, place is clean and Yuppah's Thai kitchen provides an excellent atmosphere. They offer a large selection of appetizers, Thai drinks, dessert, noodle dishes, entrees, and alcoholic beverages (have not tried yet). My boyfriend and I always get their drunken noodles and the simple, but good salad bar they offer during lunch. I recently tried their Thai iced tea and it made my day! Curry puffs are worth the time. Dinner is a bit pricey for two college students but still worth the go since the foods offered on the dinner menu are not available during lunch and of course, the food is still drool-worthy. Thank you Yuppah's for making me finally enjoy Thai food :)"}
{"text":"Good fast service, but lacking in flavors, Yupha's is your run of the mill Thai place. Probably won't come again but the lunch prices were great, and they have a salad and soup bar which was a plus (even though the soup was cold). 3/5"}
{"text":"With my coworkers and they wanted Thai food and found this place on Yelp. I ordered the Pad See Ew with chicken. At lunch time, it comes with a salad bar and soup station. They do have an interesting sign above saying to take only what you can eat, for if there is too much waste, they will need to increase their prices. The only thing with my dish was it was too sweet. I really do not like spicy food but it should not taste like a dessert."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I'm jaded from the lack of truly delicious thai food after trying out so many different places only to be let down.

Yupha Thai did not start out good for me as the soup and salad they provided for lunch was bland and tasteless (like soy sauce mixed with boiling water).

I ordered the Pad Thai with beef and while it did come out piping hot (a good sign), the portion size was a little lacking. My dish had more veggies than actual noodles...

If you're looking for authentic Thai food that will truly hit the spot...you're likely to have to keep searching..."}
{"text":"If you even think about finding a great Thai meal in the Phoenix Scottsdale Tempe area. Race as fast as possible to Yupha's Thai Restaurant. 
OMG!! In Tempe Arizona. 
I have eaten at hundreds of Thai restaurants in Thailand and America of course. San Francisco and New York etc. 
*This is ONe of The Best!.  Yes!  Among the tops!!
From the soups to the curries and right up to the coconut ice cream with fried banana for a truly refreshing desert.  Yummmmmmm!
As a bonus the staff is sweet and smiles are generous.  By the way.  The service is Fast!!"}
{"text":"Really good food.
Lovely atmosphere.
Attentive and gracious service.

My only complaint, is that at quarter to 9pm, (closing time during the week) the staff begins to make you feel very uncomfortable. They were taking things off our table at 8:45 pm. Packing up our food. Asking if I want a plastic bag.They took our wine glasses and our bottle of wine before we were through. The manager was ready by the front with her keys in hand, to lock the door as soon as we were all gone. We were not the only two people in the restaurant. There were 2 other parties at tables, getting the same bum rush that we were getting. It nearly ruined the experience for us. Meanwhile, the staff was all eating dinner together in the rear of the dining room.  At exactly 9 p.m. the lights were turned all the way up. I have been a server and it is annoying when people stay far past closing time. However, this is too extreme. I will still come here for dinner, but I will go early so my meal is not ruined by staff trying to rush us out."}
{"text":"Food and service is great.  Good at pre bussing and attentive. 

Thai rolls light and airy with plum sauce  on a bed of cabbage.

The chicken coconut soup was good but browning the mushrooms first would really elevate it.

Beef pad thai and panang curry good. I sub rice for rice noodle.  Portions are smaller than thai basil though,  and panang not as sweet and was too spicy . 

Love the homey feel to the location."}
{"text":"Yupha's came highly recommended by a coworker so we went here for lunch.  The ambiance of the restaurant is very cool.  It's open, calm and even though it was very busy, it was somewhat quiet.  

I ordered the Pad Pak with chicken and a side of fried rice.  I'm really sensitive to spiciness and their \"mild\" has a bit of a kick to it - but not to the point where it's unbearable.  The veggies were cooked to perfection.  My dish was incredibly flavorful.  And that fried rice!  I will be going back there just to order the fried rice!  It's the best I've ever had in my life!

Definitely a great restaurant!  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"They have the best Fried Rice. I love all of their soups as well. Their ambiance is great for a strip mall restaurant too. The service is always quick and helpful. Best Thai in Tempe hands down. I just wish they had pot stickers on the menu."}
{"text":"just got back from lunch here. it was simply D'light'full. I'm a big fan of the Thai, and this little hole in the wall spot did not disappoint. soup, salad, chicken pad Thai, egg roll all for $10. fresh, home made goodness. A+ all day."}
{"text":"Yupha's is close to home and A SERIOUS FIND!

On a Friday evening, 7 PM, I got the urge for papaya salad.  My Yelp mobile App found Yupha's as one of the Thai restaurants close to home.  I got in the truck and headed east to Yupha's in anticipation of, because it was Friday, a bit of a wait when I got to the restaurant.

Arriving at Yupha's, the parking in front of the restaurant was pretty full.  Entering the establishment, I took in what was about 20 tables seated, some dining, some waiting for food, and some just finishing their meals.  I was met at the door quickly and ushered to a table.  The waitress presented me with a menu and asked what I would prefer to drink.  I ordered water and looked at the menu.

My water was delivered in about a minute, and I advised I was ready to order.  The waitress took my order for Som Tom, Thai Hot, along with a side of Jasmine rice.  The prices in the menu are cheaper than the prices on the website, so I was pleasantly surprised.  

The restaurant is easy on the eyes...subdued lighting, tinted windows and partitions throughout that provided a sense of defined space and some privacy at the same time.  Music was subtle, conversation there, but not too loud.  The water was filtered and served with lemon, very refreshing.

My wait for dinner was not nearly as long as I anticipated.  From ordering to being served, I waited barely 5 minutes.  The portions of salad and rice were both impressive, about 2 1/2 cups for the Som Tom and about 1 1/2 cups of rice.  The salad was nearly perfect!  The spice was right on (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat, 10 (Thai Hot) brings tears to my eyes.  The dressing was a bit sweet for my tastes, so I asked the waitress for some lime.  She was gone barely 30 seconds and back.  The accents of sweet, sour, spicy and salty were perfect!  I also experienced hints of garlic that were just right.

My server came back and asked if I needed extra napkins as the tears were beginning to run down my face.  I advised that everything was wonderful and I had enough napkins.  

Thank you, Yupha!  You have certainly proven your skills!  I also appreciate that you have the fortitude to display that firearms are not allowed in your restaurant.  It is gratifying to see that you are willing to state your preference toward a violence-free experience.

Know that I will return!"}
{"text":"Pretty comparable to California's thai food restaurants. The yum nua was good and I liked the drunken noodle. The pad thai was too drenched in sauce/seasoning.. The sour smell was too strong. Not getting that again."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix metro area. Yupha and her staff do a great job - I've enjoyed everything I've tried."}
{"text":"Yupha's Thai Kitchen is a pretty nice little place. My girlfriend and I are both big fans. The foods reasonably priced. The service is great and timely, and as a picky eater (typically) I still find lots to digest here. My favorites are the Thai fried rice, Lard Na and the Pad Thai. Typically I get these with tofu-- which they always cook to perfection and supple tastiness. 

Every time I've been here, it's never been particularly busy, even at dinner and lunch. This place is a great little hide-away of Thai goodness. Definitely worth stopping in to have a meal at..."}
{"text":"Me and my Curry kick are at it again.

While others complain of it not being Hot enough, I Ordered mine mild and it was a bit spicier than other places \"mild\" but it was just right to me.

I was first served a bowl of broth with a few veggies(see pics) it was good.

I ordered the Red Curry with Tofu (see pics)
I thought it was OK, it was mostly bamboo shoots and peppers with tofu, there were only two green beans and 4 very small pieces of eggplant in there. 
Kinda disappointing after the abundance of veggies I've gotten at other places.

Another bummer is they don't serve you that yummy little egg-roll with your meal either.
I was really looking forward to that, so I ordered them separately (see pics) and they were not as good as I hoped.

No choice of soup or salad , you just get soup and No egg-roll. So while it wasn't bad, It wasn't fabulous either. 


NEXT!

P.S. on their daily special board they misspelled Broccoli as Broccori...hee hee hee"}
{"text":"Friendly owner that serves good Thai food in a clean restaurant.  I ordered the Tom Yum, papaya salad, and the 304, and topped it all off with some coconut ice cream (yes I shared my food).  The hotness was dead on, I ordered hot (not thai hot) and my dish was just right.  The food had good flavor and didn't let me down.  

Prices are similar to other nice sit down Thai restaurants so I don't understand all the complaints."}
{"text":"Love this place !!  Great foods.  Very quick service!!!!  Duck Curry is my favorite!!"}
{"text":"This place is a great lunch spot!  The soup and salad buffet that's included with lunch is small but you don't come here for that anyway.  The meals are made with fresh ingredients, deliciously seasoned, with nice side features that are unexpected for a lunch under $10.  

I've had the Pad Khing Sod cause I'm a sucker for ginger but I've got my eye on that one with the kaffir lime leaves..."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed lunch at Yupha's at least 1-2+ times per month for the past 4 years. The service is fast and the food is consistently delicious. The all-you-can-eat salad bar (with its delicious peanut dressing) at lunch time is a nice touch, as well as their quieter/darker ambience at dinner. All their entrees I've tried are excellent, although I'm partial to their curry dishes. I see this remaining a favorite for years to come."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend and I really liked their beef padseeew.  Padseeew is my usual order whenever I dine at a Thai restaurant and since I've also had experience working at a really good Thai restaurant, I am picky with my padseeew.

The noodles were soft, the beef was tender and the overall taste was on point.  I also liked that they used regular broccoli as opposed to Chinese broccoli.  I appreciate that it was not too oily or salty but just right.  It came with a piece of egg roll which was light and crispy.  Good portion--I didn't finish it all but I was decently full & satisfied :)

+Venue itself is clean and decorated nicely. 
+Service was attentive and very accommodating.  
I would recommend this place to anyone who is in the area and craving Thai :)"}
{"text":"Food was OKAY. just okay.
My friend and I had tom yum goong and nam sod to start off our dinner. The tom yum goong was flavorful, but didnt have the authentic taste. It tasted very strongly of fish sauce, authentic tom yum has a sour bite and instead of having dried chili flakes for the spice, there is spicy chili oil that makes everything blend so well together.  The nam sod was too sweet and lacked of that spicy sour thai taste as well. 

I had the pad sa eew.
It was too sweet, comparable to hoisin sauce. The sweetness was overwhelming, I felt a little sick and got over the taste pretty quick.
My friend got the panang curry. It was too runny for curry and tasted quite bland.

For dessert we had coconut ice cream and sweet sticky rice. The rice was delicious, the ice cream was pretty tasteless by itself, but when eaten with the rice it tasted perfect. For its price though, the portion was not worth it.

The service there is friendly and when asking for their suggestions or opinions on dishes, not very informative, but they do try their best to explain and are honest. I appreciate her effort, accent and all lol.

This is arizona though, im from california, what was I expecting after driving around and seeing how arizona was like lol.

You guys pwned with your mexican food though. OMG."}
{"text":"We got there at 2:30 on a Saturday and were told that we can order for 10 minutes. 

We didn't realize there was a lunch special and they cut that off at 3. 

No problem! The drunken noodles were delicious. My daughter got the pad see euw and loved it as well!

All this for their lunch special price. 

I will go again!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! It's definitely among the best thai in the Valley and somewhere my husband and I visit regularly. It's busy, so you may wait a bit for a table, but overall, the service is pretty quick from that point on, and the food is really amazing! Pad thai and red curry are both delicious at Yupha's."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food, likely the best in the east valley.  Yupha's Fried Rice is their standout dish for me, but all parts of the menu have been enjoyable.  Some folks have rated Yupha's low due to the owner's attitude.  Running a restaurant has to be one of the most difficult things to do--I say cut her some slack.  Anyway, I go for the food, not the service."}
{"text":"Amazing place. 

Best Thai I've ever had and I've eaten at quite a few Thai places in several states in the US. The waitresses are adorable and very helpful. The head chef and owner often comes out to make sure everything was perfect. They serve plenty of beers including domestics as well as foreign beers for a great price.

The atmosphere is authentic and feels like a foreign country, which adds to the experience. And the bathrooms are BEAUTIFUL inside. Not only clean, but decorated to the nines. 

Not too pricey! 2 meals and a couple of beers only came out to around 40 dollars and it was VERY WELL worth it! You need to experience this place!!!"}
{"text":"you lost me Yupha! I haven't been here in a long time, though I always recommend it. Yesterday we were a group of 5 and \"group\" tip is something that get's to my nerves. Probably I wouldn't be writing this re-review if at least the service had been good. 

Seems we had the bad luck to have a newbie under train but she got confused in the orders, forgot some napkins we asked for and finally we had a mix of 2 or 3 other persons, who also kept forgetting that one of us wanted to ask for desert."}
{"text":"Warning. Yupha's likes it hot. Their mild is not so mild.

I'll admit I'm not that into spicy food. Wherever I go for thai food I always order the mild. Usually that means little to no spice. At Yupha's mild means spicy. I ordered the pad pak - mixed veggies with chicken. It was so hot my tongue was burning. So I asked the waitress if I could get it remade and se did accommodate me and told me \"next time order no spice\" will do! But then not 5 minutes later I overheard a guy saying the same thing about his pad thai - too spicy. So at least it's not  just me!

When I got my fresh order it was delicious. A nice mix of veggies and flavorful sauce - just no spice! And the servings are huge! I had plenty left over for another meal.

So if you like spicy food you'll get your fill here. If you don't, remember to order no spice or get ready for your tastebuds to go up in flames."}
{"text":"Pros: 
No problems with the food.

Cons:
The service. I was with my elderly grandparents, who do not speak fluent English. The waitress was extremely rude from beginning to end and made our first experience uncomfortable. Instead of explaining in a patient/kind manner, she became frustrated quickly when my grandfather didn't understand the menu right away. She jabbed her fingers at the menu and rolled her eyes and raised her voice at him. My grandfather is not an obnoxious person, nor is he one to act rudely to anyone. We all watched her in disbelief because we couldn't believe what we were seeing/hearing. I have personal experience working as a waitress myself in busy restaurants and I have NEVER, EVER acted in such a rude, horrid manner to even the most ridiculously obnoxious customers. We left with a bad taste in our mouths JUST BECAUSE OF THE SERVICE, which is a shame. Because the food was amazing. Dear management, thank you for the food, but please instruct your employees in basic manners. I'm very hesitant to recommend this place to friends and family. Please fix this problem or you will lose more customers this way."}
{"text":"loved the pad garlic Thai and Thai iced coffee. loved it. will visit here again. it's amicable environment too."}
{"text":"Good Thai place. I've had better but this is definitely worth going if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Recommend the curry puff and drunk noodle. Very yummy. But they only give a tiny little bowl of rice for curry stew. And they charge 1.5 for extra rice. Overall it's a good experience."}
{"text":"My first time having Thai food and I have to say it was a pleasant experience.  Everything was very fresh and delicious.  Portions were very much on the small side.  Prices a bit high--$50+ before tip and without drinks only to be dying of hunger 3 hours later.  We arrived right at opening time and had to wait 15 minutes for the doors to be opened.  Great decor and ambiance.  Thankfully you can order all dishes with very \"mild\" spices, as I have heard that Thai can, in some cases, scorch the mouth.  My wife really enjoyed her custard dessert.  I had the flaming, fried ice cream, which was so doused in rum that any home-prepared deliciousness was drowned out by a scent/taste that reminded me of paint thinner.  All-in-all, very pleased.  Not sure if we'll be back based on price vs. quantity.  Taste was great.  Except for that particular dessert . . . have to avoid it in the future."}
{"text":"To the Yelp-powers that made my previous review for Yupha's the ROTD, thank you so much!

Update on Yupha's awesomeness: When I wrote the last review, I had only had dinner. Since then, I have gone to Yupha's for lunch and it's even more amazing! Their lunch specials are $7.99 and come with unlimited soup and salad bar that you can serve yourself at. The soup is a clear vegetable broth and the salad (kale, cabbage, etc -- super healthy) comes with cucumbers, tomatoes, carrots and onions as garnishes and they have a to-die-for peanut dressing. You can even do an unlimited soup and salad lunch for just $5.99.

I hope you all enjoy Yupha's as much as I do!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to take a client out for lunch for her b-day, and she chose Yupha's because she had eaten there before and liked it.  She ordered an appetizer and an entree, I just ordered an entree.  About half way through our meal, I managed to get the server's attention and asked about the never delivered appetizer.  She went to check, and returned in a while, apologizing for the delay, saying it was her fault, not the cook's fault.  As we finished our lunch, along came the appetizer.  I think it was called Buddha's delight, not sure.  Fried tofu puffs with a dipping sauce.  We each ate just one because we were full.  The b-day girl took the rest home.  Then came the check, with no appetizer on the bill.  I assumed we were comped the appetizer due to their mistake so I said nothing and put my money on the tray.  She took it, then quickly returned, saying the bill was incorrect.  Another bill, with the appetizer included, was on the little tray.  I said nothing and put more money down.  I will never go back there again.  What tacky service!  As for my lunch, it was just ok.  I have had \"drunken noodle\" at other Thai restaurants in Tempe that was much better."}
{"text":"Yupha's is great!  Don't be put off by it's strip mall location (or paper napkins); this place is casual yet still nice enough for date night.  My husband and I have been there for dinner twice and we thoroughly enjoyed both meals.  Our food was served warm (hot, even) by pleasant and competent wait staff.  As others have mentioned, the Drunken Noodles are outstanding.  We've tried two desserts: the sticky rice with mango, and sticky rice topped with coconut ice cream - both were excellent.  We found the crab puffs to be a little oily so we'll skip them next time.  I also like that they serve (non-alcoholic) beverages in a carafe so there's no wait for refills.  Their prices are just a smudge high - two ice teas, two entrees and one dessert came to right around 45.00.  We'll stop in for lunch next time to check out the buffet."}
{"text":"Best Thai in the East Valley,  terrific service and reasonably priced.  The duck is always perfectly done.  A great place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new I recommend the drunken noodles hot. This entrée goes good with a cold beer.  If looking for Thai food I would recommend.  Waitress was very accommodating. I found the place to be clean with ample parking."}
{"text":"Yupha's has become an addiction in our house! I love love love the red coconut curry with fried tofu and veggies. The staff is friendly and fast, and take-out is very easy. The restaurant itself is always clean and the decor is tasteful. If you love thai food this is the spot for you."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for lunch today. 

We had the lunch special - he had Pad Thai with tofu and I had the Pad Sa Ew with Tofu. Both dishes were DELICIOUS! Plus they have a little salad bar and soup for you to have before your meal. 

We will definitely be coming back here for lunch :)"}
{"text":"Okay, we are back.  My favorite places to dine I try to visit a few times a year cuz I don't want to ruin a good thing by od'ing on it.  Ya know what I mean?  We have dined at Yupha's when it was in the strip mall behind Olive Garden just up the road for 5 1/2 years, and more routinely at this location which they have been at for more than five years now.  Yep, we have been dining at Yuphas that long.  Almost hard to believe they've been around that long, but I'm very glad they have been successful.

So onward and forward.  Tonight I was seated promptly and given a chance to review the menu options.  Was pleasantly surprised to see new items on the menu AND a wine list with a selection that's much improved ---that alone was long overdue.  
So many tasty sounding options, that alone makes deciding a difficult thing to do.
I opted for a salad with duck, red onion, green beans, etc. and my son chose Pan Ang Curry.
Our server was polite, efficient, and  she did not hover excessively.  I could only ask that she returned sooner to take our order but part of that is our fault not being able to decide quickly.  I blame the new menu options for distracting me.

Favorites:
Himalai
Pra Ram
Pink Diamond
Tofu Song Krung
Thai Jerkey -the Papaya Salad is an acquired taste that I haven't acquired.  
The Curry's are also fantastic but our favorites are the Red and Panang.

Occasionally I like to have the Drunken Noodles or Yupha's Fried Rice.  Yummy stuff.

Conveniently located near the Tempe Pollack Cinemas makes it all too convenient to catch a movie before or after a delicious meal here.
We have been tempted to bring a meal in with us from Yupha's but I think others might be distracted by the fragrant aromas of real food.

Glad this restaurant is in my neck of the woods."}
{"text":"One of my regulars. This place is phenomenal! Some of my favorites are the penang and massaman curries - both have this creamy peanutty taste to them. So rich and delicious! Staff is very friendly too but can sometimes seem rushed but they always take time with you if needed. If you want something to drink beside water, you might need to be proactive and tell them.

I make it a personal goal to bring a new friend along each time I go and they always beg to go back."}
{"text":"Tried it more than twice and not satisfied. The flavors aren't bold and left me wanting more. Some plates were too salty and others were too bland. The closest to best thing we had was the chicken with basil, peppers and onions. Even the thai tea was too sweet."}
{"text":"Super tasty!!  I ate here for the first time tonight, fun, colorful setting.  The people are super nice, and the food was quite pimp, I shall return!!"}
{"text":"I was a server and I know how hard it is to work in a restaurant but this place is rude and provides zero customer service. I had to ask 3x in 15 minutes for a glass of water and still did not get it. I didn't get a menu, utensils, or napkins either but at the point I didn't give a shit. They clearly don't care if you're not part of a big group or something. I will never go here again!!

Nothing but rudeness and that's offensive. Most people will not put up what I put up with. I'm only extra patient because I worked as a server but even I have limits and this place really tested me."}
{"text":"I have been going to Yapha's for years now and they never disappoint. Each meal you order you're able to get soup and a salad from the soup and salad bar. It seemed strange at first putting hot peanut dressing on a cold salad but wow that dressing is so good I could drink it. I always dump a little in my soup as well it's so good. The service is always a little slow but I would wait any day for such kickass food. I always order the drunken noodles with beef thai hot it's so good. A must stop for any one that loves great thai food."}
{"text":"I've dined in several times and ordered takeout once at this restaurant. Every time I am greeted warmly and usually seated quickly.

Restaurant and restroom are always impeccably clean.

My favorite items to order are the Thai fried rice with beef, massamun curry, chicken satay, and the chicken Tom Kha soup. It tastes just like the food I had in Thailand while visiting my family there! The only thing I wish they did differently was to have sliced cucumbers in the cucumber salad that accompanies the satay. I dont care for the teeny-tiny diced cucumber, but the flavor is spot-on."}
{"text":"When we make the long trip to Phoenix we just have to stop here! Appetizers were great, the main course was amazing and the coconut ice cream is to die for! This is a must stop when you are in the Phoenix area!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and just the right spice. Their garden salad was pleasing with our meal. A must if you are looking for great food!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice within the last week and both times the food has been excellent. I really love Thai food so I think most places are great but Yupha's is definitely worth checking out over some of their competition. 

At first I was a bit worried because it is kind of tucked away in a strip mall so I was expecting business to be slow. Both times I have been in for lunch it has been very crowded. I have tried their red curry and pad Thai and both were very good. 

Only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because after getting our food I didn't see our server again until we got our check. I am not someone that wants to be constantly approached by the staff but a simple \"is there anything else you need?\" Or \"how is everything\" would make up that little difference. I ordered my food Thai hot and ran out of water. It would have been nice to have had someone check in and refill our carafe.

All in all the place is great and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my Thai food expectations. I'm picky about Thai restaurants since one of my uncles is Thai and he has his own Thai restaurant. The food is not Thai standards for spicy which works for most people who don't typically eat a lot of Thai food. I ordered my food medium expecting a little kick, but it was as if I didn't order any spicyness. However, it was still very good and flavorful. The price was within what I expected and the service was up to par. We will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Located in Tempe. Great food and very friendly service. Fresh ingredients. Generally meat in most Thai place in AZ is not friend. At yuphas it is fresh, moist and tender. Spice level is catered to your palate. Prices are reasonable and restaurant is great for a date or family outing"}
{"text":"Favorite Thai place in the area. Excellent food, especially the Curry Puffs. Plus nice atmosphere & service so love having dinner there."}
{"text":"Sooooooo YUMMMMMMY!   I went to my first visit today for lunch and had the green curry special!! Love the all you can eat salad.  The salad dressing is to die for!!!!   My daughters can't wait to go back either. They had appetizers for a meal and shred half and half.  They serve you fast too!!!"}
{"text":"Is it me? I just can't seem to find \"the best\" Thai restaurant here in AZ. I have visited Yupha's twice and have had good experiences on both occasions. My husband loves the drunken noodles and I thoroughly enjoyed the Pad Thai. We've also tried the sampler appetizer (yummy) and the Tom Yum Goong soup...way too salty! The kids haven't developed a palate for Thai food, so we ordered the American style kids meals they offer, chicken nuggets and fries, disgusting! The kids meals tasted worse than generic brand processed frozen food you would get at the grocery store. Luckily, the desserts made up for their disappointment...the sticky rice and fried banana desserts were excellent (just wish it was bigger!). I am used to amazing Thai restaurants in Northern California, so I am probably biased with my rating. I will visit again, but considering they are a little pricey, probably not more than a few times a year."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight. It was a disappointing meal. I ordered red curry shrimp and a cucumber salad. The curry was not as good as I remembered. The texture was quite thin, almost the consistency of water. And there were no kaffir lime leaves. And I counted only 5 shrimp. It came with a skimpy portion of rice. I was still hungry after I left. Also the \"cucumber\" salad was 75% red onion, and 25% cucumber, without any vinegar bite. 

If I had received a meal like this the first time I went, I would never have thought about driving out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"A few nights ago, my Brother mentioned that he was going out for Thai food and asked if I would like to join him. I said \"Sure\" since I have never experienced Thai before and it was something that I had always wanted to try.  We were greeted right away and seated in a nice booth by the Window.

I ordered the Gaeng Kua Sapparod with Shrimp which is what Yupha's recommended. This dish is red curry simmered in coconut milk, pineapple & lime leaves. I chose the \"Medium\" spice level as things that are too spicy can wreak havoc with my digestive system. The sweetness of the coconut milk and pineapple blended with the spiciness of the red curry produced the most amazing meal.

My Brother ordered the Tom Kha Soup with Pork and the Pad Thai with Shrimp, Calamari and Scallops for his main course both with the \"Hot\" spice level since he enjoys more \"heat\" than I do ;). He was extremely pleased with both of his choices.

To finish off, we shared the Coconut Ice Cream. It was deliciously creamy and the perfect way to end our meals. 

I will be holding all Thai restaurants that I may visit in the future to the standards of Yupha's."}
{"text":"Easily some of the best Thai food I've had. You can never go wrong with the Drunken Noodles here and I'd probably eat anything covered in their peanut salad dressing. Great artwork and ambiance. Service is just okay - they're very efficient, which is crucial for a restaurant as popular and packed as Yuphas, but sometimes the servers just come off as abrasive. It depends on who you get. Otherwords I love ordering from here and this is the first place I recommend to people looking for a Thai fix."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, unlimited soup and salad.  Extra charge for brown rice, and portions are an average size."}
{"text":"Bad service leaves a bad after taste, and I won't be coming back for more. 

First time I ate here I loved it. The Pad Thai was yummy, the ambiance was nice, and it was perfectly placed next to Tempe Cinemas making a great go to for a date night...or so I thought. 

Second visit was about 30 minutes prior to closing. In most restaurants that's not a huge deal, but here it means they will ask you for your order before even getting to look at the menu, remind you every ten minutes that they're closing soon, and pretty much stare you down until you're uncomfortable enough that you can no longer enjoy your meal, ensuring that you don't leave a single minute past closing. Fine, they don't like to work late. Noted. 

Fast forward a few months for a stop in at lunch. Doors locked. Seems we're 15 min. early this time. No big deal, we'll wait. As we wait we see the same woman who was so rude before. The same woman who is always there. She clearly sees us but doesn't open the door...not until exactly 11:01 that is. You would think she would open the door we were standing at, but nope. First she opened the door on the opposite end, then stopped to answer the phone, then merely unlocked the door we're standing in front of and walked away as if nobody was standing there. Not a smile, not a hello, not a thanks for waiting. Nothing. 

I thought maybe she recognized us from before and this was an isolated incident but I've now read other reviews stating the same. Perhaps all the positive feedback has gone to her head to the point that good service has become irrelevant? Maybe it's just as simple as her not wanting to work a minute extra? I dunno. What I do know is that part of what makes a dining experience worthwhile (at least for me) is the service. Food with attitude doesn't taste nearly as good, and I'll gladly go to one of the other ten Thai restaurants in the area the next time I get a craving."}
{"text":"I brought my date to this restaurant because of her previous experience with their green curry. We ordered the green curry and the chicken basil with a sticky on the side. Although the green curry and chicken basil was delicious, the sticky was rock solid. As far I can remember, sticky rice were not suppose to be like rocks. 
Furthermore, we ordered the mango sticky rice dessert. That too was a big disappointment. It was sad when my date stated that she can make better product that Yupha. 
Lastly, the service was sub-par when it gets busy. We tried numerous times flagging a helper for addition rice. I think the service is good when it isn't busy. 

Although this restaurant is close to my house, I don't think I will visit this place much...unless I crave some green curry...."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a former work colleague.  It was super busy on a Friday for lunch.  There was about a 10-15 minute wait.  Thankfully I got there early.  Popular place.

Food was tasty.  We had yellow and red curries.  It was a nice portion.  We also had the Thai wings for appetizer.  It was good.

Probably a little pricey for lunch.  Need to bring my family here sometime.  It's right by our church."}
{"text":"Yupha's Thai Kitchen
1806 E. Elliot Road
Tempe, 85284

I have eaten Thai food in many different places both in and outside of Arizona, but this place is either at the top or almost at the top of Thai places to eat.

I was joined by two companions for dinner. I started out with the Thai rolls ($4.95). Beautifully crispy spring rolls served with a nice sweet chili sauce. Companions both agreed that these were really good.

Companion #1 ordered Pad Prik Khing, which was chicken sautéed in house curry paste with string beans, bell peppers and lime leaves. Companion was concerned about how spicy the food might be, but the cook made it to companions order and it was pronounced perfect. Companion completely finished the plate.

Companion #2 ordered Scallop Gra Prow, which was sautéed scallops with onion, bell pepper, Thai basil and Thai chili pepper. Companion liked the food on the spicy side, and the chef was happy to comply. Companion completely finished the plate.

I ordered Ped Khing Sod - crispy roast duck with ginger, mushroom, onion, celery, bell pepper, ground pork and bean sauce. The duck was fresh and cooked to perfection. I loved the sauce, and the veggies were properly crisp and cut into nice, mouth sized portions.

Both companion #1 and I ordered Thai tea, which is almost a necessity for removing the heat if it gets to be too much. I ordered my duck at medium heat, and next time I will order it at the hot level because I didn't find it to be nearly hot enough for me, but then again, it's a matter of individual taste.

About the only thing I didn't really care for was the rice that was served with the dinner. It seemed to be overcooked and not at all like a good rice should be in texture.

We all decided to have dessert. Companion #1 had a concoction of  grapefruit with a coconut macaroon, which was pronounced quite good.
Companion #2 had flaming fried ice cream, which was a whole world of difference from what is usually served as fried ice cream in other places. The batter was a totally different but excellent texture, and the waitress lit a cruet of rum on fire at the table and them properly poured it over the fried ice cream. Not only was the presentation nice, but the taste and texture were pronounced excellent.
For my dessert I ordered Crème Brulèe, which is not usually on the menu but is a special for this month. I've eaten this dessert across the states, and it is usually good, but in this case, it was outstanding. The crème was silky smooth and wonderfully thick with a not too thick layer of burnt sugar on top. It was like a trip to heaven. 

The place is nicely clean and the restrooms could be a model for a lot of other places - clean, fresh, and nicely appointed.

This is easily the best Thai restaurant in the valley, and matches or bests other places I've eaten at across the states.

5 stars for quality of food, cleanliness, service and ambiance."}
{"text":"Man, do I regret not trying Yupha's sooner! 

Dude and I have lived almost walking distance from here for nearly two years and we finally stopped in last weekend. 

Yupha's is super deceptive if you judge it from the outside only. I was expecting a Chinese take out (think Hot Wok Mr Cook) type of place, but WOW! 

Very beautiful, aesthetically pleasing decor. Given how many people were in on a Saturday night, it wasn't overly loud like I was anticipating. Just the right ambiance for a date night. 

We were seated immediately, and once we had a chance to check out the menu, our server came by to take our order. 

We ordered the almost obligatory Thai Iced Tea, Drunken Noodles with Beef and Red Curry with Chicken - Both Thai Hot. 

The Thai Iced Tea wasn't anything spectacular. 

Red Curry was the perfect balance of meat and vegetables. They did not skimp on the chicken and it was cooked just right. 

I really enjoyed the Drunken Noodles. Also very generous with the steak and vegetables. The noodles weren't dried up like the last Thai place we went to. 

I will say though with the spice levels, we'll go double or triple Thai Hot as single Thai Hot was more on the higher side of medium for our spice tastes. 

Both dishes were more than enough for two people and we had leftovers to take home.

Overall, friendly service, fresh, delicious food, in the neighborhood ... Will definitely be back when a craving for Thai strikes!"}
{"text":"Had a group of eleven people dining at Yupha's tonight.  My group of three shared the soft-shelled crabs with veggies and garlic sauce and honey roasted duck with steamed veggies (delish, but half of the plate was duck skin and fat, which doesn't translate to good value for the money).  We still enjoyed dinner, however.  We also ordered the excellent homemade coconut ice cream, which upgrades this review from a three- to a four-star!  My other companions enjoyed apps of chicken satay w/ peanut sauce, and fried and steamed dumplings.  I heard the pad thai was very satisfying.  

After conferring with my cousin, who agreed with me that the crabs, while good, weren't as tasty as before, we've decided we'll just stop by when we have a craving for coco ice cream.  Hmm... having ice cream while chatting over a viewing at the discount cinema next door sounds like a great outing to me!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great lunch specials and dinner is excellent. The food is always flavorful, hot and freshly prepared. They have the BEST peanut dressing I have ever tasted. Pad Thai and Pad Se Ew are great. Chicken Panang is just the right amount of spice and curry. Drunken Noodles Thai Hot are delicious. You just can't go wrong coming here ever. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food! Delicious soup & salad bar to accompany a wonderful entree. If I lived here, I would be a regular!!"}
{"text":"The food was good... I had the Pad Thai with vegetables. It was ok the egg flavor was a bit overpowering. And I wasnt a fan of the broccoli could have been cooked less also it had mushroom in it which was weird. Their Thai tea was really good I asked them to make it with coconut milk which was nice. 
Their service was not so great I felt rushed and the waitress only came to the table a couple times. The place was busy but they looked like they had enough people working there we had to wait 5-10 min for someone to even come to the table after we asked where our server was finally the girl came."}
{"text":"Solid Thai place that I have eaten at on a couple different occasions when in town.  Service has always been friendly and polite.  I started with the Calamari Strips, which were quite good.  A different way to have Calamari, but they still light and perfect to dip in the accompanying mayo chile sauce.  For my main course, I opted for the Pad Garlic Sauce with Pork, which comes with white rice as well.  The sauce was delicious and really complimented the seasoning in the pork.  A nice combination of flavors, and just the right portion size.  No leftovers to take home, but filling.  It left me just enough room to finish off the meal with their Thai Tea ice cream.  Unique and light, it was a nice end to the meal.  Overall this is a nice spot to grab a bite when your cravings for Thai kick in!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth going for their lunch special!
You get soup and salad with your meal.
The husband and I ordered pad thai and drunken noodles, both were delicious.
The pad thai is the best I've had, outside the city (NYC).
The service is very fast (and they were full to their capacity) and still nice."}
{"text":"I was craving for thai food tonight so we came here to try the drunken noodle because it look so good in the pictures! Wow! People are right, it was so good! Service was okay but can be improved. They checked on us when we were almost done. Down side was i came here really hungry so our food took 15-20mins before it arrived, it felt like 30 mins for me."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai cuisine at reasonable prices for lunch.  The lunch specials include unlimited soup and salad as well.  The salad comes with a warm peanut dressing that is very tasty, and the soup we had was a clear broth with vegetables.  The curry dish I had was the right amount of spiciness (I asked for it regular hot), had very fresh ingredients and was packed with flavor."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and I keep coming back, I don't know why I haven't written a review yet!

The atmosphere at night is pretty dim and nice. The servers are always so sweet and will answer any questions you have about the foods on the menu. I believe it is family owned (don't quote me!)

They do close for a few hours; closed from 3pm and reopens at 5pm (before they close would be considered lunch and after would be considered dinner). With lunch, you will get a slightly smaller portion but with that- free salad and soup. Ugh, don't get me started on the AMAZING peanuty-like dressing for the salad, IT IS SO GOOD. 

I ALWAYS get the Chicken Pad Thai and Beef Drunken Noodle. Honestly, I'm not just saying this but every single place I eat Pad Thai and Drunken Noodle with, it's never as good as Yupha's. I always compare my Thai food with this restaurant's because it always comes out SUPER flavorful and bold, no ingredient is ever skimped out on, and the texture of the noodles are great. We occasionally get the Pad Woon Sen which is like a plate of clear noodles (with veggies and all that) that come with a bowl of rice and your choice of protein- that dish is a great neutralizer to all the bold, savory flavors that you're getting with the Drunken Noodle and Pad Thai.  If you're ever not a fan of bold, savory, flavorful kick in EVERY bite, get the Pad Woon Sen to cancel it out. 

I have nothing negative to say about this place! Please, please, please give this restaurant a try! Great service, AMAZING food. I definitely come here at LEAST once a month and I will always keep coming back."}
{"text":"Went in at 9pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately. We asked them if anything on the menu could be made dairy/egg/meat free and it turns out they are incredibly veg-friendly!

We ordered the Gaeng Kua Sapparod with tofu and the drunken noodles also with tofu. I enjoyed both, but I was particularly fond of the curry. Subtly sweet coconut broth enhanced by the big hunks of pineapple, lime leaves, and fried tofu. The drunken noodles were like any drunken noodles, nothing special to report. I liked them though, for sure. I only wish the serving of jasmine rice had been larger. We needed to order a second bowl. 

Service was prompt, friendly, and courteous. The place was near closing and a little messy, but it wasn't bothersome. I'll be back. Lots of yummy dishes to try."}
{"text":"When Yupha's used to be on Elliott and Hardy their prices were lower and the portions were bigger.  Now they are at Elliott and McClintock, and with the move came a price hike along with a reduction in the amount of food they served.  For me, they have priced themselves out of my regular rotation.  The food is still tasty enough when I am in the area, but I wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Free mini salad bar and soup.  The place is always very clean, and packed with customers, signs of a good restaurant!  I only go for lunch during the week, because it's located near my office, but I wish it was closer to home :-)

-Cheers,"}
{"text":"Eh this was a bit of a letdown.  I didn't exactly have great expectations, despite the raving reviews, but I was still holding onto a fool's hope that this place would be at least...somewhat good.

Nope.  Not as good as Thailicious by a long shot.

Since I don't like going on negative tirades when I have no resentment or anger toward the establishment, I'm going to phrase everything in a more positive way!

Yupha's totally passed with flying colors the following tests:

1. Is my chicken satay devoid of flavor test: PASS
2. Is the meat in my entree dry: PASS
3. Does the portion seem skimpy even for the lunch special price?  PASS

Really there are only 3 redeeming things to be found here:

1. Par thai iced tea.
2. Friendly, on point service - can't deny this at all.
3. FLAMING ICE CREAM (I would go back just for this)"}
{"text":"The food was great. I get the Yupha's Fried Rice or the Pad Thai.
My girlfriend gets the curry.

They ask you how spicy on a scale of 1-10. The first time we got a 4 and a 6 and we were both dying (and I eat spicy food all the time, raw peppers, etc).
This time we got a 1 and a 2 and it wasn't spicy enough. I think I'll go with a three next time.


BUT:

My only complaint is the \"No Firearms Allowed\" sign.
For those of you with CCW permits, please take note of this because it will instantly turn you off to spending your money somewhere.
Since they serve alcohol, people without permits already can't legally carry there, but since I have a permit I am legally allowed to carry in a place that serves alcohol (I don't drink, obviously).
I probably won't be returning due to this when there are countless places in the Phoenix area that respect my right to self-defense."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner before heading back to the Bay Area. I'd never been before but after having some good Thai in SF, we decided to find a spot nearby. Yupha's is tucked back in a strip mall and is very warmly decorated. The service was good and there was quite a good crowd coming and leaving while we were there. We had the golden crisp puffs to start which I am a huge fan of, and we both had red curry - chicken and beef. I had the beef thai hot and for someone who likes spice, it wasn't too hot but it did have a kick and was very flavorful. It was my guest's first time having Thai and he described it as \"excellent\". I would definitely recommend and return if I am back in the area."}
{"text":"We are a big fan of this place and happen to go there once a month atleast. Yuphas special friedrice and their curries are midblowing. Mango with sticky rice is yummy too. Only bad experience I had was with drunken noodles not being upto the mark. 
Staff is very warm too except one(named Jennifer ?) who seems to frown most of the time. Overall one of our favorite Thai places."}
{"text":"I like to order for lunch and pick up as every time I stop in this place is busy, as it should be. Everything I have tried so far has been awesome, cant go wrong with anything."}
{"text":"Excellent as usual for lunch. Service and food all excellent. We had the Chicken Pad Thai (Sautéed rice noodles with egg, scallions, bean sprouts, ground peanuts & sweet radish), Chicken Tom Kha Gai (Creamy coconut milk soup with mushrooms seasoned with lemongrass, kaffir leaves, galangal, lemon juice, topped with scallion & cilantro) and Chicken Pad Garlic Sauce (Sautéed with garlic, ground pepper, served with mixed vegetables). 

I really need to come for dinner and try."}
{"text":"Love Yupha's!!! Wonderful food with lots of flavor. Reminds of food I had when I was in Malaysia.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong -- love Yupha, love the food, the service (most of the time) and the decor. Last night was a real turn-off.  We arrived at 820 for dinner. Still had about 4 tables of people and they willingly sat us. from that point forward it was rush, rush rush. we gave drink orders immediately, but when asked two minutes later for our food order and we asked for one more minute we were told the kitchen was closing in 10 minutes. so we quickly ordered all our food (including dessert). first appetizer came out at lightening speed and was delicious. Our two main dishes came 5 minutes later. dessert a few after that. then, about 10 minutes into eating our food, they started moving furniture around, turned on the bright overhead lights and started cleaning for the night. the cashier came over and gave us our bill, telling us she needed to close out the computer now. one server swept up our wine glasses though my dining companion still had wine in it (she stopped her). when we asked about the rush, we were told that the servers had to catch the bus (admittedly, service runs sparsely in our area at night). But, if you want to have your restaurant closed by 9, put out your closed sign by 815 at the latest...don't take us in and then rush our through our meal. we ended up taking half of it home."}
{"text":"Next door to the cheap Tempe Pollack theatre. Just had quick dinner with my friend before a movie. We went around 7pm and it was packed!  We both ordered chicken pad thai (mild). It was good but the service was slow. I understand it was busy but I don't recall the server checking on us at all. We had to flag her down to get the check and it took about another 10 minutes to get the check."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times. Always always delicious food. Staff is warm welcoming and quick. 
Food is consistently delicious. Highly recommend it to Thai food lovers. 
Their lunch specials are also really cheap!"}
{"text":"This time I ordered to go.  Pretty fast and tom yam with tofu and mushrooms was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Curry curry curry!!!  A clean and well established Thai restaurant. You must order the homemade coconut ice cream with sticky rice!"}
{"text":"Very delicious food and also reasonably priced. The staff was very kind and patient. I ate Thai fried rice and Pad Thai and they were both super delicious. They have a few levels of spiciness. Mild, medium, hot, Thai hot and up. I chose mild, which was a mistake, IMO. I think medium would be ideal for me. Anyways, if you love spicy foods or feeling a little adventurous with your taste buds or crazy, you can try the Thai hot as the guy next to me seemed like he was crying and choking when he ate that. 

Overall, solid food, solid prices and solid environment. Oh, and there's a $3 theatre right next door if you wanna catch a movie after dinner."}
{"text":"Best pad Thai I've ever had!!! I get pad Thai from this restaurant at least once a week!! I have tried many places in the valley and no one adds up to how good this place is and how friendly their staff is!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I lived in Thailand for 3 months and have been back several times and when I cannot make it to there I go here. Lunch here is the best to try it out and get their amazing peanut sauce salad and soup along with your meal. If you are in a hurry check out the menu before you get there so you can be in and out in your lunch hour."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Saturday night. It wasn't overly busy at around 7:00 and we were seated right away. I had the crispy roasted duck with mushrooms, ginger, etc. My wife had the May seafood special. Both quantities were more than ample for one person to get very full on and both were very tasty! Spiced just right and the flavors were balanced very nicely! We'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, good service.   What else to say, especially good for lunch.

When they say \"hot\" they mean it, so be aware when specifying stars of hotness."}
{"text":"Was here so long ago and almost forgot  where it was. Lucky we found it, food was amazing like always. Staff treats you like family. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Still the best Thai restaurant around. This month they have an appetizer special, grilled sausage, loaded with lemon grass and Thai herb, moderately spicy - great flavor. Hope they keep it on the menu. Siam wraps fantastic. Very pleasant and helpful staff. Nothing to not like."}
{"text":"First let me state that i have lived in Thailand for more than three years.  Yupha's Kitchen is the best Thai food in Phoenix.

Thai food is my favorite cuisine.  The French invaded Thailand and held it as a colony for may decades.  During that time the French cooking techniques were merged with the traditional Asian ingredients and techniques.  The result is modern Thai food, the greatest food today.

So with regard to rating a specific restaurant there are three components.  The authenticity of the food, the quality of the food, and the quality of the service.

Yupha's Kitchen is a winner on all three.  The owner (always present) definitely knows how to cook authentic Thai recipes.  The mix of fish sauce and lime is perfect, the mix of protein and spice is perfect, and the mix of textures is perfect.  Secondly the ingredients that are served are top notch.  I have eaten at many Thai restaurants that really do get the spice mix part but want to serve less than top grade proteins.  At Yupha's you will get very fresh chicken or beef or pork.  Thirdly the service at Yupha's is amazing.

As a world traveler, I will say not only is Yapha's the best Thai food in Phoenix, it is one of the best in the west period.

{"text":"Yupha's is one of the best Thai restaurants I have been to in the Valley. The interior is very classy, and perfect for a nice romantic dinner. The food is delicious. I especially like the yellow curry and the drunken noodles. I am vegetarian, and thus always get all entrees with tofu. The texture on the tofu has been spectacular every time I have been at Yupha's (I hate soft/silken tofu, and the tofu here is fried to the perfect crispiness). The spice level has always been adequate (I like spicy, but not Thai spicy) and has been spot on every time I go there, compared to other Thai restaurants in the Valley (for e.g. Thai Basil, Thai Rama etc.), where I have found there to be day-to-day variation."}
{"text":"BEST. THAI. FOOD. hands down. 
I love everything they have, you cant go wrong if you are feeling adventurous."}
{"text":"One star because I feel ill after my meal and i only ate half of it.  Something seemed off in the kitchen.  No one at my table liked their food. I have eaten a lot thai but do not consider myself educated enough to comment on how authentic it is.  I can say the food was  ot tasty and we didnt finish it ny choice. The service was fine. Would I give it another shot based on the other reviews? Probably not,  as there are other places to try.  We ordered multiple soups,  my coconut milk soup was far too sweet,  and I've had it elsewhere.  The drunken noodles tasted heavy,  and not in a good way. The desserts were better for those who ordered."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for a quick lunch.. Mid-week. We were seated right away and the food arrived fast.

I ordered the beef noodle soup, hot, it was a big bowl. The meat was tender, the spice was hot, just enough noodles. It was delish, very filling, and perfect cold whether soup. Warmed me right up!! 

My daughter had the drunken noodles, big plate, very flavorful. Too much food for her.

The salad & soup bar had a warm peanut salad dressing that was tasty. 

Can't wait to try some of the other lunch specials.. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best pad Thai I've had yet.  Spicy just the way I like it, noodles cooked perfectly .  We had crab puffs and they were great as well.  Great service and the restaurant   was clean.  I highly recommend  eating here!"}
{"text":"We discovered this restaurant completely by surprise a year ago and it quickly became our favorite Thai restaurant.  The single drawback is that it becomes very crowded Friday and Saturday evenings so we go on other nights.  That said, there are no other complaints and, in fact, the service and food has always been excellent.  My wife is the great experimenter so she orders something different almost every visit.  I, on the other hand, love their Royal Massamun Curry and tend to eat that most times.  We frequently go with other family and friends and no one has ever complained about their food."}
{"text":"Poor service. The waitress didn't even have the patience to complete listen to what I was asking for. There was a long wait before the food arrived. On top of that the chicken was undercooked and tasted sweet! I puked as soon the spoon touched my lips. Horrible place never coming back. Weren't even apologetic about it."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai is Thai Pepper in Huntington Beach. . but this place was really good and I would come back if I was in Tempe..."}
{"text":"Always amazing food. The pad thai is delicious as is the yupa fried rice with pineapple. Service is always fast. The salad and soup bar is a great bonus as the peanut sauce is to die for!"}
{"text":"I just had to update my review to five stars because this place is THAT good. Seriously.

We now have a new weekly meet up called #ThaiTuesday (or the occasional #ThaiThursday) and I cannot imagine living a week without this delicious treat. In fact, this week I had it Tuesday and Friday. Plus I will be back Monday and then again next Thursday. I guess you could say I am addicted.

This is the first restaurant I have been a \"regular\" at.. and I love that they know my exact order. Although I am having a splendid love affair with the yellow curry (medium-hot) today I also got the Kao Pad with Tofu... its my new obsession!

The Buddhas delight appetizer is amazing too. Deep fried tofu wedges with a spicy sweet peanut sauce. MMM MmmMMM.

Do yourself a favor and compliment your meal with a pot of jasmine hot tea too!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food places in AZ . They're so polite when you go in and your food is ready on time. I usually order take out but the dine in experience looks amazing . Love it ."}
{"text":"I've heard this place hyped up by alot of people so I came in with high expectations. I ordered the pad see ew and Thai ice tea with cream. The pad see ew had an odd flavor and the beef was very chewy. I would give it a 5/10. The thai tea was rich and tasteful,  a 7/10. The atmosphere was nice and they had good business. Service was friendly and the food came out much quicker than I would have expected from a Thai restaurant. Overall the food was just okay but I could see myself coming back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"When I visited Freescale, I had lunch at Yupha's.

It was before Lunch time but a lot of people 
try to eat Lunch at here.

Small salad bar was free and all you can eat.
Peanut  dressing was sweet and delicious
with variety of vegitables.

I ordered  Buddha's Delight (Fried Tofu) for appetizer.
Outside was crispy but inside was soft.
I could feel some kind of harmony.

I ordered Phad Sew and yellow curry.
Those are more delicious than other normal 
Thai Restaurants'.

I found a good restaurant by chance at 
Tempe, Arizona."}
{"text":"The Green Curry with Chicken was breathe-takingly good.  I am new to the Phoenix area having moved from DC and really missed the availability of great Thai food.  This Curry was better than some that I ate at the Thai Embassy in DC and rivals the best Thai restaurants in the world!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food I have had hands down! Great service great company great food! I love coming here it's like a journey to Thailand makes you feel like your are there cry good meals!"}
{"text":"First impressions were right!

Whnn I walked into Yupha's for lunch today, I was surprised by the bright, warm atmosphere in this strip mall restaurant. The place was nearly full, and yet the staff had the time and awareness to greet me right away. The service was quick and we weren't bothered unnecessarily during our lunch cconversation.

I ordered the Pad Garlic Sauce and asked for it medium. It arrived quickly and looked beautiful. It was enough to fill me up for lunch, so I didn't partake of the salad bar and soup, but they did look delicous. My friend had the salad and raved about the peanut dressing.

It was a great expeerience, and I'll return to try more items on the menu. I feel like I've found a locals only treasure a few miles from home."}
{"text":"The lunch special is great. The salad and soup bar is always so yummy and fresh. I always meet my family here for lunch and we continue to come back for the great food and awesome servie. Yupha is always walking around making sure that you are taken care of. The red curry is my favorite!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have experienced in the 3.5 years I have lived in AZ. My 92 years young Mother is loving it as well. Nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This is some yummy Massaman curry! I've had it with chicken and with veggies and it is so delicious...I can't wait to have it again!!!"}
{"text":"Yupha's is awesome!  It can be a little busy at lunch, sometimes, but the wait usually isn't very long.  I've brought more than a few friends here and they all love it!  Red curry, chicken, hot is my standard for Thai restaurants and I love it here!"}
{"text":"You have got to be kidding me!!! Yupha's is now up to 185 reviews. There is no way that anyone would look at all 185 reviews before selecting this as the place to go for a fantastic Thai lunch or dinner.

I took a visiting family member here for lunch the other day. I knew he would not be disappointed. I now give myself a little pat on the back . . . .I was . . . oh so right! He ate everything on his plate. Every last rice kernel. Every single drop of yummy goodness. (Oh, and by the way, SO DID I!) 

Yupha's did not fail to delight my taste buds once again. Service is fast at lunch, but cordial and efficient. No mistakes. Love this place. Absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"This place lived up to what I expect of Thai cuisine (not necessarily mind blowing but satisfies a need) and quick service and turnover of tables. 

The pad woon sen was a good tasting dish with a generous helping of tofu as the protein. They did seem to mix up the spice level on two Curry dishes but we didn't feel like complaining and suffered through that. Taste, price and decor seems on par with other Thai places."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE restaurant. If you ever come here try the pad Thai! You should also try the chicken satay for the appetizer! The food comes really quickly too and is very family friendly! You should definitely eat at this restaurant"}
{"text":"Yuppha's is my favorite thai spot. Its got great food, atmosphere service, and even a live band on some nights. Its a fun place with awesome food. I have yet to be disappointed after countless meals."}
{"text":"This place can get very busy. A sign of good food and service. Despite this they do their best to get you in a reasonable time.
Food is excellent. My wife is very sensitive to MSG, preservatives etc, so she avoids quite a few restaurants because of this. However she loves coming here since she never has any problems with the food.
Service is excellent and food super. Love this place."}
{"text":"Yupha's recently moved east on Elliot, they are now right next to Tempe Cinemas.  Anyone say dinner & a movie?

We had 2 appetizers, one good one merely average.  The Chicken Satay was particularly good with tender and juicy chicken that had a very nice yellow curry aroma and flavor.  The other appetizer was Little Mermaid which is shrimp and bacon wrapped in spring roll skin.  It was not nearly as flavorful as I expected.

The main dishes we shared were Pad Thai and Panang Curry.  The Pad Thai was particularly nice with fresh and distinctive flavors.  We ordered the Panang Curry with chicken and beef and we ordered it mild so that the kids would try it.  It had a bite, but not nearly enough to bring out a sweaty brow-so pretty mild.  It was very heavy on coconut milk flavor and the curry was nice but it could have used a bit more complexity.  There were an abundance of string beans which were hardly cooked at all-too crisp.  I think they were just tossed in at the last second.  There were just a few sections of red pepper and a couple of lime leaves.

The service here was very good.  We had 4-5 people checking on us regularly and my water only went empty once.  I drink copious amounts of water, so that is pretty good.

The atmosphere was nice and open with a very clean and modern take on a Thai restaurant-I approve."}
{"text":"Not so good Thai food. I ordered pad see ew. Has no taste."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

One of the best Thai restaurants in the Valley.  Traditional, not too Westernized, they try to mix it up occasionally with specials like Northern Thai dishes such as khao soi.  (Definitely not as good as Lotus of Siam in Vegas, which is 5 stars.)

But they don't go too sweet in their dishes to cater to Western tastes, and they do tend to go a little spicier than normal, which I appreciate.

We've had a pretty wide range of their dishes.  Their tom yum gai could afford to be a little more sour, but it is pretty good.  Their curries have been more than passably good, and apart from the occasional too-soft noddle, their noddle dishes are well-spiced and well-balanced with good size portions.  They have more duck selections on their menu than most other Thai joints, and they have been pretty good as well.

It's not the best Thai in the country, but it comes to being pretty close to the best in the Valley.  Better than Chanpen, yes."}
{"text":"Thanks to fellow \"Yelpers\", 6 ladies enjoyed a most fabulous lunch at this restaurant today.  We all love Thai food and have tried numerous restaurants in and around the Phoenix area.  I had the Green Curry special (with chicken - it's my most favorite item on a Thai menu); flavorful, fresh. HOT and delicious!  The $8.95 special included a trip to the salad/soup bar.  FRESH is the primary reaction to this addition - a warmed peanut dressing topped the beautifully sliced veggies for the salad (tomato, onion, cucumber, etc.) tossed onto a serving of head lettuces, carrots and the likes.  The amazingly tasty vegetable soup  was flavorful and light - loaded with fresh, crisp veggies.  Our entrees arrived steaming hot and cooked to perfection.  Each dish was accompanied with a crispy Thai roll.   We ate too much but every bite was more delicious than the one before.  I'll go back again and again!  (You can take in a cheap movie next door at the Pollack Theater).  To Melissa W. of 2/11/2011 - I LOVE hot and spicy foods....they met my desires.  However, if you don't want it hot, tell them.  They'll most certainly accommodate you."}
{"text":"With so many Thai options in the Valley, this place really does stand out. The variety I think is what sets Yupha's apart from your everyday Thai restaurant. 

The ambiance is fitting, and the dining area is very clean and elegantly decorated. All of the times we have eaten here, the service has been very attentive and accommodating. Even the owner is there in the dining room greeting guests on most occasions.The wait staff knows their food and is willing to explain the dishes and substitute ingredients where may be necessary for you.

I really love how they have monthly specials for lunch and dinner. It really makes for an experience that doesn't get mundane; although with their vast menu it would take quite some time for the food to get boring here.

The sampler appetizer is a great place to start to get an idea of the variety they have. Along with a piping hot bowl of soup, your appetite is going to be begging for your entree. Everything from the nutty Pad Thai to the super savory Massaman curry to the endless entrees (try the eggplant basil for something you won't find anywhere else), there is something here for everyone. Specify your level of spice, and enjoy a fresh-made entree that is sure to leave you wanting to come back.

The portions are nice and large; enough for two meals if you have the will power to stop halfway. Sure, the prices are a little higher than what you may find at another Thai place, but one meal here and you'll see the quality of the ingredients and the care that goes into preparing each dish is a cut above the rest."}
{"text":"We came in last night for dinner; me, my wife and out two boys. It was late so the younger one didn't feel like eating. After we ordered the waitress hassled us since we only ordered two entrée's and an appetizer. It was like you can't eat unless you order another entrée. This is the first time we have had to deal with this.
Unfortunately this is our last time there. Owners; don't loose customers over a $15 entrée."}
{"text":"Have had thai in a lot of different cities and Yupha's is one of the best. Tried the bbq chicken and the pad si ew. Both were great.

Terrific service too."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I ever had. If you haven't tried this place yet...you really are missing out...its that good!!

I ate from the dinner menu and had the Thai barbeque classic, my stepdaughter had Thai fried rice  (she's 9 and very picky) and my friend had one of the Pad entrees. For an appetizer we had the Golden curry puffs. Because of the way the food is served, we were able to share everything.

Everything, and I mean everything, was delicious! I can't wait to go again. No one in my party had any complaints all you could hear was \"hmm\" \"so good\"...etc."}
{"text":"My father loves the curry. I tried the shrimp in a clay pot. Both beer and wine are served. Parking is at a premium as it is near the theater. Great go to for Thai. The owner is usually on site."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and the food is consistently great!  The curry and noodle dishes are wonderful and I've yet to find a Thai restaurant that can beat the tastes.  I am picky about spices, and how savory/sweet Thai food is, and you can be in the Phoenix area as there is so much competition.  The first couple times I was impressed, but worried they couldn't keep it up.  However, they haven't let me down once and the customer service is good, right down to giving me my own water pitcher even when I am dining alone.  I can't wait to try the Thai iced tea flavored ice cream when it's 100 degrees!"}
{"text":"I had family in town and we were craving some good Thai food. This was in so many ways an awful experience for our party of 4 and very embarrassing since we were trying to show our family a good time and enjoy a nice dinner. First off, when we came in we asked if we could have a booth but the server said they had none and took us to a table. As we sat down we noticed a booth was indeed available across the way but another party was sat there just a minute later and we didn't have time to ask if we could move. OK no biggie. 2nd, it took FOREVER for someone to come to the table, once they did they simply said are you ready? Really? No apology, no introduction to who you are or a welcome? Nope, none of that. OK fine, of course we already knew what we were having since we had forever to look at the menu. Our food came about 30min later and it was good BUT no one ever came to check on us to see how everything was, if we needed anything (which we did). Fast forward to the lovely way our meal ended. We asked for boxes and they came with boxes and a check. We were going to ask for their dessert menu but I guess at 9:30pm on a Friday evening they were already getting ready to leave. It truly felt like they wanted us out, everyone out so the staff could go home. We saw kitchen staff hanging out in the dining room looking around as we were chatting, obviously they wanted us out. Now let me explain, I've got a background in restaurants over a decade of experience. I would not sit around for hours after closing while staff is waiting on us. I'm telling you it was 9:30pm, there was a party of 8 right next to us still dining and another couple of tables. They all stared us down. Needless to say, no dessert and we paid the check. Also, I almost forgot to mention how the staff was mopping with Fabuloso (I know the smell very well) while we were eating our meal. Not once we were done, but while we were still eating. Do you know that it's not the best idea to clean with chemicals while your guests are still dining? I will not give this restaurant another chance. They had many chances and missed every opportunity to make things right. We did not enjoy our dinner and there are simply too many other options all over Phoenix & Tempe to have good Thai food with great service. I rarely give out 1-2 star ratings but this one was well deserved. If you go, hopefully you have a better experience than we did."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant for lunch.  I of course get the Pad Thai which is always great.  But they also have a soup and salad bar.  I can not tell you how much I love the hot peanut salad dressing.  I have also had a few of the appetizers and desserts and every single one of them have been fantastic."}
{"text":"This is my friend's favorite place to eat Thai food, and she's a picky person.  The staff know her here, too.  I had gone to one w/ her the day before and totally tasted the difference in the food.  We ate family style.  This is what we ordered off the menu, all of which were really delicous:

257.  Papaya salad
Shredded green papaya, tomato, string bean, garlic & ground peanuts in Thai chili & lime juice

252.  Yum nua*  
Grilled marinated beef tossed with red onion, scallion, cucumber, tomato & mint leaves dressed in lime juice

854.  Pad Thai  
Sautéed rice noodle with chicken & shrimp, brown tofu, egg, scallion, been sprouts, ground peanuts & sweet radish

902.  Yupha's fried rice  
Thai fried rice with egg, chicken, onion, pineapple, scallion, cashew nuts & fried shallot

852.  Drunken noodles*  
Sautéed flat noodles with Napa cabbage, tomato, bell pepper, onion, egg, Thai basil & chili pepper"}
{"text":"Had the Little Mermaid app and Pad Thai... both really yummy! The Pad Thai was quite spicy - I asked for like a 4 out of 10 because some Thai places any more don't serve their food as spicy as you ask - this was right on though!

Can't wait to try more of their menu :)"}
{"text":"Great Thai food at a great price. They throw in a simple salad and soup bar with your lunch special (a meal all by itself). Nice decor and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place deserves a 3.5 but that's not an option so I gave them a 4. 

Food - 
I got the Pad Pak and loved it! Great mix of fresh vegetables in their homemade sauce. I love my stir fry to have a lot of extra sauce for my rice and they nailed it! The tofu is a firm consistency and isn't too soft or too chewy. 

The Drunken Noodles were great too. The veggies used are fresh and have a good crunch to them. 

The Thai tea was amazing!! It wasn't too sweet and still had strong tea taste to it. 

I love love love spicy food. Medium wasn't very spicy at all. I should've gotten the HOT level for my pad pak. HOT level on my drunken noodles was perfect. 

Service - 

The service however, was subpar. It was quite busy when we went but we were seated within 10 minutes. Once we sat down, we ordered our drinks and food. After that, we did not see the waitress until she dropped off the curry puffs. The couple next to us who sat down about 20 minutes after us got their food at the same time we got ours. Once we got our food, I had to keep looking around to wave someone down for chili paste. They were never rude, just not very attentive."}
{"text":"The Thai fried rice is my favorite, but I've never had a bad meal here and Ms. Yupha always has a smile on her face."}
{"text":"Love their lunch options - always busy but well priced and yummy!!! Good to go for casual dining - pretty authentic Thai - just about everything on the menu is good."}
{"text":"Yupha's has a homey atmosphere fitting of a Thai restaurant. The gold wall decor and Asia-inspired paintings are a nice touch. The panang curry, while creamy and sweet, did not live up to the recommendation I received, promising \"some of the best\" Thai in Tempe. The spice levels tend to lean on the milder side- I would recommend ordering one level higher than usual."}
{"text":"I've been here many times,  I'm never ever disappointed.   The lunch specials are phenomenal,  the peanut dressing will knock your socks off.  The salad is always crisp and fresh, curry, perfect.  Just take a moment and treat yourself,  your won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love love love Yupha's!  The food is always fresh and exactly how I order it, plus the service is always friendly and the restaurant is immaculately clean.  I don't live close and anytime I want Thai I make the drive to Yupha's.  If you are a fan of Pad Thai, theirs is delicious.  Hot is definitely hot enough unless you want to burn off your food sweating while you eat, then order the Thai Hot!"}
{"text":"The food at Yupha's is excellent - 

PROS: 
-Eggplant with tofu is my favorite dish. Slightly charred with tons of flavor
-Green curry
-Always busy, great energy
-They serve alcohol

CONS:
-Service can be slow and clumsy
-A lot of white folks have discovered this place so it is no longer a secret
-Spice level is not consistent, we just go with mild to then have folks add their own spice level via the garlic sambal"}
{"text":"Came here because of the review and the movie theater next door. Didn't go wrong! They made the spicy food I was craving for after a marathon 12 hours working without proper lunch! Drunken noodles was best with Napa cabbage and finely made tofu"}
{"text":"Food is always good. I enjoy the tofu and the yupha shrimp fried rice. I pretty much have enjoyed everything I've tried though."}
{"text":"Finally I have found great Thai food in this area!   The food was delicious and the service was great too.  The drunken noodles were amazing,  as was the sticky rice with coconut ice cream."}
{"text":"Came to try the Tom Yum Gai & Thai tea. Service was very friendly, my food came out quickly. Ordered my food to go, so maybe my experience will be different when I eat there. 

 Soup was very good, was very happy with this. Flavors were perfect, could have had more chicken though since I got the pot for two but only enough chicken for one. 
My Thai tea was the disappointment. For the price I feel a kid sized cup is not appropriate. Would have rated higher except for this."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Thai place between Central Phoenix and Chandler.   The serving staff isn't dripping with warmth, but they're attentive and pretty quick.   We've been there half a dozen times and haven't made it too deep into the menu yet, but so far our favorites are the Pad gra prow and the Massaman curry.  And the Golden Curry Puffs are delightfully different and delicious appetizers.  We took some Thai food lovers here from out of town, and they agreed, it was as good or better as any Thai they'd had in a variety of cities."}
{"text":"-Updating from 2 to 4 stars because my review was a bit emotional. I'm still pretty upset, but their food is so good I can't stay away!!!-

Would have had 5 stars until tonight.

I love Yupha's, their food has always been good enough to warrant a 30+ minute drive to get there. However tonight they were severely understaffed for Valentines Day, which lead to a terrible experience.

After waiting over 20 minutes to put in our order our server asked if I wanted my curry spicy, and I said yes as it was how I have ordered it in the past. She did not specify how spicy, and when I received it was to the point where I couldn't even taste my delicious food because my mouth was on fire. She had put in for Thai hot. Queue another 20 minute wait with empty drinks and my boyfriends food getting cold as we waited for our waitress to come by our table again.  

They did replace my order no questions asked, but the service is honestly the worst I have received. I used to waitress, and am very patient in most circumstances but after nearly two hours, most of which was spent waiting to even see our MIA server I was not impressed. If I had received a smile, or even 30 seconds more of her time the entire situation could have been avoided or at least I wouldn't have left with such a bad taste in my mouth. 

I will be returning for take-out in the future as the food is delicious, but I will never eat here in person again as the service was a real downer on a great day!"}
{"text":"Yupha's is a great lunch spot. It is usually full for lunch hour during the week so we usuLly go early at 11 or late at 1. The food is good and I love their warm peanut sauce on the salad and the soup while mostly broth is very tasty."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places I've been to. Love that they use Thai peppers to spice up your food instead of the dry spices."}
{"text":"Very fresh food. Can customize all the curry base without fish sauce. Excellent salad bar at lunch. Little spicier than other thai places."}
{"text":"The service here was the best part of my experience. Our waitress was on it, and gave the perfect amount of attention without being annoying. I ordered the Green Curry with crispy tofu.. Thai hot. Sometimes Thai restaurants will skimp on the heat when I order this way, but Yuhpa's did not. I highly recommend this plate.. Very good! My fiance went with the Pad thai, and her dish was great as well. Coconut ice cream to cool off with after dinner was yummy. This will be my go to spot for Dinner and a Movie in the Pollack Center.. even though the theater bums me out sometimes. 

Yupha's Thai Kitchen ranks among my favorite Thai restaurants in the valley, and I am excited to explore their menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to get some grub to go. They have a large menu. We got some spring rolls, Pad Thai, Thai BBQ chicken and chicken satay. I love me some Pad Thai but it could have been a little hotter for me and i got it at medium. It's hard to judge since each Thai place is different with spice but Hot would be a safe choice here if you like a little kick. Food was ready pretty quick and order was hot, correct and delicious. 

Nice decor and pretty big restaurant altogether."}
{"text":"Good authentic Thai food!  I enjoy it more in the restaurant than for take out - the food is much better fresh from the kitchen, and the portions seem bigger!  The restaurant is nice and offers the ability to be casual or a little dressed up.  The price point is not as affordable as I think it should be but it's a very nice restaurant with friendly service and good quality food, so not going to really complain about the price too much!"}
{"text":"I love Yupah's. The staff is friendly and even when they are busy they provide quick service. I love coming here for lunch. Food is always good and I love that they can modify your food and make it gluten free! Definitely my favorite Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelper's, once again, for getting it right.

Very pleased with this quiet, out of the way, small family-run restaurant.

We had a noodle dish with beef and an entree with chicken and shrimp. Nice portion sizes. I like Jasmine rice. \"Medium\" spice was really very mild. There were red peppers in evidence in the sauce. But, if you want to feel a burn, medium won't do it. There chili sauce had a lot of interesting flavor to it. It wasn't just hot to be hot (and it wasn't all that hot, either).

\"American\" iced tea: yeah, skip this one. Barely better than Lipton. The Thai iced tea was very rich.

Coconut ice cream with taro root for dessert. The ice cream was OK. The taro was delicious.

Service was polite and competent but on the slow side.

Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The menu was very off-putting we had to leave before even ordering. Where have you seen \"no sharing\" in a menu unless it's a buffet? This one clearly isn't a buffet. Sharing is caring in case they are unaware. Lunch special soup and salad is self-serve? Is it so time consuming to serve your diners a plate of salad and bowl of soup? Lastly, they charge for side orders of CONDIMENTS like $1.75 for fish sauce and $3.00 for peanut sauce. Lol what??? Anyway, Thai restaurants never disappoint on their food, but with this kind of menu and customer service this place is one I'll never go back to."}
{"text":"Yupha's gets a lot of buzz, so I decided to check it out.  In a word, this place is \"meh.\"  The food wasn't bad - it was just mediocre.  At any rate, Yupha's definitely doesn't live up to all the hype.  I was actually more impressed with the food at Thai Rama on University (just east of Rural)."}
{"text":"Somehow, in the last two years of living in this city, I managed to overlook one of the best Thai places in this State. Although I've only been to a handful since moving here, this one is my new go-to place.

A couple of my girlfriends and I came here to celebrate one of their birthdays. This place was about 60% full on a Tuesday night when we got there, which I took to be a pretty good sign. It quickly filled up in the next hour or so. 

We ordered: beer, plum wine, green papaya salad, a yellow chicken curry, penang chicken curry and the Evil Jungle Princess dish. That was my choice. 

Drinks: They were good Plum wine was a little sweet, but I was expecting that. 

Food: For the majority of the dishes, you get to choose to add a protein and also a spice level. We went with a mix of no spice/medium spice. 

Green Papaya salad - It's one of my favourite Thai dishes, and they do a superb job here with the balance of flavours. My only complaint was that there was a lot of lettuce used as a filler, but the tangy fish/lime sauce went great with this as well. 

Yellow chicken - it's mostly potatoes and chicken. DELICIOUS.

Penang chicken - My family is from Singapore where the cuisine is very similar to Penang, Malaysia, but I couldn't really guess what the Penang curry would taste like. I think there's more depth to the flavours than the yellow curry, and the dish had a richer colour to it. It was really good however, and came with more vegetables than the yellow curry.

Evil Jungle Princess - I had to. Basically, this was a bunch of vegetables cooked in some kind of curry substance that tops a plate of noodles. I forgot there were noodles and also ordered a bowl of rice. For future reference: that bowl of rice is not necessary. This was a really good dish and had a bit more tang to it than the other curries. I really enjoyed that there were a TON of vegetable in this dish. So many in fact that I'm glad I ordered it without a protein.

The servings were large, and we all took food home with us. Fun fact: TSA will look at your leftovers through the x-ray machine and search your bag. 

Service: It was great. People were friendly. 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"So its kind of an understatement that I am a bit of a picky eater. I pretty much don't like anything. My buddy Kris asked me to dinner one night and suggested to come to this place. He said it had good Yelp reviews and was close to his house. I reluctantly agreed, mainly because the last Thai place he took me to was kind of \"meh\". I'm very happy that I agreed because this place was awesome. So awesome, that I have been back multiple times!! I've been to a few other Thai places around town, many of which are good, but non as good as Yupha's!! I strongly urge you to try this place, I don't think you will regret it!"}
{"text":"In my opinion the best Thai place in AZ.  Very healthy portions, very flavorful food, very friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I don't usually venture to Tempe but a date suggested it so I was excited to try it! There aren't many Thai restaurants in the Phoenix area and the ones I used to frequent have been closed for awhile (thaifoon and jax).

The decor is okay (as a designer I'm kind of critical) but as for being in a strip mall, the decor is great!! We went early on a Sunday night so there was no wait. The server we had was sweet and attentive and our food came out very quickly. 

I ordered the chicken coconut soup (which I love but haven't had since jax closed). The portion was rather small but perfect for a starter. I ate every drop and still had plenty of room for my entree (and usually I get stuffed pretty quickly). It was really flavorful with big chunks of chicken. 

Then for an entree I got the yupha's fried rice with chicken because of the rave reviews on here from other yelpers. I concur - the best fried rice ever!!! I will be craving it!! Love that it had the pineapple and cashews and nice big chunks of good quality chicken. A little heavy on the onions for me but I just picked them out. Again, AMAZING!

Both the soup and fried rice I ordered as MILD and they were that - just a tiny bit spicy. I was scared to order MEDIUM but I like a little more kick so I'll try it next time. 

My date didn't want anything for dessert but I had to get something. I asked for the mango sticky rice (which I love) bit they said the mango aren't in season right now - which is fine - I'd rather not be served hard mango chunks and be charged $7 for them! Will have to come back when they're in season. So i ordered my second choice - homemade coconut ice cream over sticky rice. The ice cream was a little hard and icy (probably because they make it) but it was still super yummy with the rice and I ate almost all of it myself (my date doesn't like coconut).

I got the jasmine tea to drink. However, it comes without a strainer so all of the tea leaves pour into your cup! I asked if it was supposed to be like that and she said yes. I just didn't like having to spit out or chew on any stray tea leaf I drank. I noticed if you pour it and let it sit a little bit most of them go to the bottom - but by then it's a little cold. 

And I do agree with other yelpers that the prices are a little high for the quantity of food, ambiance and location. Although this won't stop me from returning. 

So I didn't give four stars because of ambiance, tea and prices. But, I will be back and highly recommend it if you're craving Thai food!!"}

{"text":"I was in the mood for some good thai food.  Not the americanized version but the real thai.  Freshly made aromatic great tasting thai food.    I used Yelp to help me find that place and was directed to Yupha's.   We arrived on a Friday evening before the dinner rush.  I ordered the tom yum with seafood and my wife ordered the  Evil Jungle Princess.  The reason she ordered it was a previous Poster Chritabel T said it had TONS of Vegetables.  Unfortunately, it had very few vegetables.  She was disapointed.  So if your ordering the Evil Jungle Princess and want TONS of vegetables you better ask your server.   My tom yum was great!  Very flavorful and aromatic.  Loved it.  Because of the inconsistency of vegetables on the Evil Jungle Princess i cant give it a 5."}
{"text":"Decent. Great Pad Thai but the rest fell just short of great Thai food. My husband and I ordered the hot pot of Tom Yum soup which was tasty but a bit on the sweet side compared to the authentic version we had in Thailand. The same for their 'Labb' which I assumed was supposed to actually be spelled Larb. Same flavor profiles but again just short of great. Staff was friendly and quick and restaurant was bright and clean but unfortunately, we probably won't come back. There are too many other Thai restaurants to try and find the 5 star."}
{"text":"Food is good. Ambience just so so. Would be nice if they had booths. I've been here three times and I always end up facing the wall. I had some sort of Sweet and sour chicken. It was made with fresh ingredients - no bottled sweet and sour sauce. The sauce was also fresh tasting. Also, there are no salt shakers on the tables. What's the deal with that?"}
{"text":"Great Food! Great Service! Great Ambiance! All in that order. 

Me and my Thai Companion decided to do lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Well \"fortunately\" the place we decided to try out was closed, so with the help of \"Yelp\" we found Yupha's. As we are \"Thai Junkies\" we carried on with our Thai Tour 2012..next stop Yupha's..

We walked in and we were greeted with a warm smile as soon as we walked through the door. We were seated, we sat down, we changed our minds. So i asked if we could sit at a different table, the waitress said,that section was closed. Hhmmm bizarre, oh well, so we settled, no big deal. We came here for the food. I have to say that this place was very clean with a relaxing, ambient setting.  

We placed our order. We ordered the Siam Wrap for an appetizer, then we placed our order. I ordered the Drunken Noodle, my companion, she ordered the Red Curry. As soon as we placed our order, we were offered the salad bar for their lunch time special. Let me tell you! The Peanut sauce/dressing was GREAT!!! We went back for more. The veggies were fresh, as well as the salad. I mean I can drink the peanut sauce, it was that good. By the time we were half way into our salad, our Siam wrap came. Excellent! The minced chicken was great! very well seasoned, I even used the peanut sauce with the wrap as well. Now came the Goodness, That was quick, was my reply. The drunken noodle was fantastic, an even amount of ingredients, the chicken was perfect, it seemed like some of the chicken was shredded, not a bad idea! The Red Curry was to die for, not literally. It had a different flavor, that I'm not used to. It had a lemon grassy flavor, the curry was thick, not too fishy, and a plenty even amount of ingredients. 

Our table was completely covered with food. Now that's how you eat Thai.. 

I'm putting Yupha's on my top three for Red Curry. I cant wait to try their other dishes.. 

Yupha's gets 5 stars! Ill be back!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai was light on flavoring on the sauce, heavy on green onion. Seafood sampler appetizer platter wasn't worth the money. The mussels were the star, but the fried items (crab puffs, little mermaids, and calamari) were mediocre.  Crab puffs were heavy on the white pepper, little mermaids were OK but nothing special, and calamari was very manufactured and clearly came out of a freezer."}
{"text":"This is a great Thai restaurant !!! My husband and I eat here very often. The Pad Thai is wonderful and so is the Himalai.
A great atmosphere, the servers are very attentive, the food is served in good time.
It is highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my yummy Thai! I love Thai food, but I haven't found a place that I love. Well Yupha's is the place. The Pad Thai is delicious! And if you want something sweet after, get the mango sticky rice. SO GOOD! Whether you need lunch or dinner, perfect time to go. But they have great lunch special pricing. Great prices, and it includes a great salad and soup bar. Service is friendly and welcoming and there's always a crowd. Food always comes out quickly too! Highly recommend Yupha's if you need your Thai fix!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, food was good, service was mediocre. I had been wanting to try this place for quite some time.  I had the red curry chicken, medium.  It was not spicy at all! The fried bananas were very tasty. However, we ordered it without the coconut ice cream - when they delivered it to the table, it was plated with the  ice cream (looked yummy).  We told the server we ordered it without ice cream -but it looked yummy and we would eat it...she proceeded to take the entire plate and i can only assume she threw the ice cream away and replayed the dish.  Made no sense to me."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today with a friend. I ordered the drunken noodles and she ordered the pad see ew. I saw the little salad cart, but no one told us if that was included in our lunch or not. So we sat there trying to make eye contact with someone in order to ask if we could go up there. We finally were able to ask as our food was dropped off. It turns out it is included! That would've been nice to know. We went up and got soup and salad. The salad was alright, fresh, but the dressing wasn't my favorite peanut dressing ever. The soup was kind of boring, not the normal either coconut -y and sweet soup or the tasty veggie and tofu soup.... it was just chicken broth with chopped, not completely cooked bits of carrot in it. Kind of meh. My noodles were alright, they were spicy, but everything was chopped up real tiny so it was hard to find the noodles. This drunken noodle was a lot different than others I have had, it had egg and had way less veg in it. It was alright, but not my favorite. My friend ordered her noodles medium spicy and it was a bit too spicy for her, so that's something to note. I thought the service was fine, not very friendly, but efficient. Overall, this place is alright, not the best, not the worst."}
{"text":"Come for lunch. The salad and peanut dressing are really, really, really good.

The main dishes are solid, and they are great at accommodating vegetarian and vegan requests. Good tofu; fresh veggies.

The only problem with the food is that something about the sauces (pad thai/pad see ew/etc) is off. They just seem to be a little sweet and runny -- maybe somewhat Americanized. 

The service has also not been great on my last couple of visits. Nothing terrible, and I may have come near the end of the lunch shift, but I got the impression that the servers would rather chat with each other or finish their side work than come over and help me. 

Still, come for lunch - you will get awesome salad/soup and entree with leftovers for a really good price. I crave Yuppha's almost every week."}
{"text":"If you want great Thai food and you really should because its healthy you must try Yuph's. Samantha will take great care of you. The lunch specials are delish. The entres come eith salad with peanut dressing and soup. Orlando is a great cook and you will not be disappointed. Come hungry! Very, very good."}
{"text":"We saw a show called Check Please that gave this restaurant a great review so we decided to try it.  It was very very good! I have a gluten allergy and when I asked the waitress if they had a gluten free menu ,even though she didn't quit know what I was needing she promptly spoke to the owner who came to our table personally and went over the menu with me. The food was excellent as well as the wine from Chile. Would definantly do this again."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Thai restaurants I've been to in the area. 

The spring rolls and peanut sauce are delicious. We always order these sides along. It's usually crowded with a wait time of about 10 to 15 minutes. The wait is worth it though. My favourites here are Pad Thai, drunken noodles and red curry here."}
{"text":"Anytime food come out less than 5 minutes after you've ordered it, it's a sure bet it's not fresh and that is very true about this place. Found the food bland and tired with minimal ingredients. The worst Thai Food I've ever had."}
{"text":"It took me a while to write this review. Yupha's already had so many reviews I figured it didn't need another one. But after almost 70 reviews, I think it should have higher than a 4. This has been my favorite Thai restaurant for 2 years running now, and every now and again I try other Thai restaurants that just aren't as good. Yupha's is exceptional. It is exceptional compared with other Thai places in the Phoenix area, and it is exceptional in comparison to Thai places I've tried in other cities, too. Their Pad Thai beats any other I've tried, and they offer fancier dishes that are always incredible: things like shrimp and eggplant, duck, and lamb. The curry puff appetizer is to die for, and they have lots of tasty salads that are fun to share. I usually pass on dessert when I eat out, but Yupha's offers really tasty, subtle desserts in reasonable portions: sweet sticky rice, rose-scented custard, and homemade coconut ice cream are all amazing. There are other good Thai restaurants in town, and you should support those, too, if you like them, but Yupha's is truly incredible, and if you've been meaning to give it a try, do."}
{"text":"Very good, but pretty standard Thai. I prefer more hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurants but this was still good!"}
{"text":"Color me impressed. This place is super tasty and the soup and salad area is a wonderful addition. Great lunch specials that will fill you up for a few bucks, this quickly has become one of my favorite Thai places in the valley"}
{"text":"Yup I'm a fan! Love the salad and soup buffet with a variety of greens and a unique-tasting dressing. It is peanut-based which at first I was hesitant to try because Im not a fan of peanuts but tasted so good came back for couple times! The portion of the lunch special is not that generous though but its worth its taste. Careful when ordering mild spicy it is actually hot in general!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for Thai food! Generous portions, friendly staff, yummy food!
My favorite dish is the pad Thai with chicken!"}
{"text":"Yupha's Thai Kitchen has the best Thai food in Tempe by far. I love everything I've eaten there and have become a regular. The staff are great, the ambiance is great. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This establishment has a great red curry with veggies!! I watched what other people ordered and I want to try EVERYTHING!!! The embance is great I wish I had more time to eat but I'm on lunch I will visit this place again and again thank you for the great food!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Yupha's since 2006, back when it was at the old location on Eliot.  I've kept coming back because the food is great quality and tasty.  Also service is friendly and ambience is nice and clean.  Can't ask for much more in a restaurant.  The reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it's a wee bit pricier than other Thai restaurants for the amount of food you get.  I can usually finish all my food at this place, but at other Thai restaurants I pay less and take home leftovers."}
{"text":"I was craving Tom Kha Gai today and Mr. Dubs had been scoping this place out for months.  What better time than to do a little take-out to go with my Ghost Adventures marathon?  

So I went to call in my order and the nicest lady picked up.  After a few questions, I placed my order of: The Sampler, Massaman in Pineapple Boat with Scallops, Pad King Sod with Calamari, a bowl of Tom Kha Gai, and a bowl of Seafood Soup.  Here's the breakdown:

- Sampler ($12):  You get two Thai rolls, two golden curry pastries, six buddha's delight, and six kew krob.  The Thai rolls are your standard little spring rolls with nothing too remarkable, the buddha's delight is your typical fried tofu, the kew krob had an interesting medley of ground chicken and spices, but my favorite were the curry pastries.  Puff pastry with curry chicken, onion, and carrots?  Yes please!  I think I would skip on the sampler if I come back and just order the curry pastries.  

- Massaman in Pineapple Boat ($16 + $3 for scallops):  Advertised on their site as a Mother's Day weekend special, I decided to order this because I love massaman curry and the added pineapples intrigued me.  While I think the $3 up-charge for like four scallops (cut in half) was a bit much, I enjoyed this dish!  The pineapple really adds a brightness to the otherwise heavy dish.  They even threw in the pineapple boat... which ended up getting tossed after I kept spilling curry all over the place.  

- Pad King Sod with Calamari ($13):  Squid stir-fry with ginger, onions, mushrooms, and bell peppers in its simplest form.  I was hoping for a balanced dish but all I got was an overwhelming garlic flavor.  I love garlic but whoa!  It was a bit much.

- Tom Kha Gai & Seafood Soup ($4 & $6):  The Tom Kha Gai here is delicious!  It might've been the blinding craving for coconut milk soup but this stuff hit the spot.  It was silky and coats the mouth!  The chicken was a bit dry but what can you do about white meat chicken really?  The Seafood Soup was mainly eaten by Mr. Dubs.  It tasted of your standard hot & sour soup with lots of lime.  The seafood soup was definitely not my favorite.

The decor was lovely and I almost wished I dined-in instead of carried out.  The service was friendly but for $61, I was hoping for a little more.  The portions are a bit small and they're pretty stingy on the seafood but the flavors for most of the dishes were great."}
{"text":"I consider myself an Asian Foodie, but I never came across a Thai restaurant I wanted to go back to.  This is one of them.  I came to eat at Yupha's on a Monday night because my friend chose this restaurant to have her birthday party at with her friends and our Wild Dining MeetUp members.  30 people attended.  

I asked the server what items on the menu were considered truly authentic, that REAL Thai people from Thailand would order.  Is this authentic?  Is that authentic?  I told her I didn't wanna eat Whitey-Gringo Thai food.  Finally she said nothing on the menu was truly authentic as would be found in Thailand because we American's couldn't eat it, too spicy.   I agreed with her, told her that I spent 5 weeks in Thailand  in 2011 and just could not eat the food.  Even asking for NOT spicy, was so hot, that all I had was diarrhea.  So I ate only Australian steaks and pizza.  When I came back to the States, I was shocked to see I had lost 12 pounds (119 instead of 131).  I thought something was wrong with the scale.  

I love duck so I chose Ped Gra Prow, $18.00   It said Crispy Skin on the menu.  Crispy roast duck over onions, bell peppers, Thai basil & chili pepper.  The server said it had crispy skin, and I love duck with crispy skin.  I ordered it for the \"skin\".  The girl next to me ordered the same thing.  Her order came first and I commented that the skin did not look crispy at all!   It was coated with a dark soy-looking sauce, \"glistening\" on it.   She poked at it, NOT crispy.   I called the server and she said it wouldn't be crispy because they put a sauce on it.  Do I want it without the sauce?   I said yes.  Well as soon as I said Yes, the dish came out of the kitchen and it was \"too late\".  

The sauce was good (given rice was insufficient to eat the sauce with, like other reviewers said), but the duck, two legs of dark meat (I prefer dark meat) and some small additional pieces were so overcooked, hard and dry, that parts of it were like old jerky, and I had to spit it out (like eating bark).  When I told the birthday girl, after we all left the restaurant and went home, she said I should have sent the duck back.  Yes, trying to eat the leftovers, so hard and dry, tasting like vulcanized liver,  I should have sent it back, but the restaurant was so busy serving 30 people and their different orders.  I find it really hard to pull the meat off the bone, so tough the duck is.  I did tell the manager the duck was so hard and dry, when I left the restaurant, but I also commended them many times for their good service.

I tasted other people's orders such as Pad Thai, but nothing tasted good enough to come back here.  I am giving it 2 stars because I felt the service was not lacking like the duck was.  They handled 30 people very well and the food came out relatively quickly, without mistakes.  Otherwise I'd give it one star if service was lacking or rude (like Yelpers know Chinese restaurants are famous for), and food was bad too.
  
The thing I liked the most about the dinner was the Costco chocolate cake that the birthday girl bought for us.  I ate two pieces!   Yum !"}
{"text":"My niece and her friends have gone here a few times and love the pad thai (rookies) so we gave it a shot. The busser vmbrought water immediately but then we waited a good 5-10 min for our server to approach and when she did, she just said, \"do you want a drink and are you ready to order\"? Well, yeah but we also want apps and have questions. We got the fried tofu which was fantastic and the veggie platter which was not. 3 small spring rolls, 2 fried tofu and 2 grilled tofu sticks with about a teaspoon of peanut sauce. We asked for more and bam! $3.00! So dumb to charge people for sauces that come with it anyways. Sis had Pad Ew and it was delicious and my other sis had chicken and veggies in an oyster sauce which was bland. Mom and neice and I all did pad thai, nothing to write home about. They added an %18 gratuity for 5, so watch out for that. Server was just kinda bitchy, not nice, not mean, just.....bitchy. No need to come here with Thaiger around the corner."}
{"text":"Great quality. Their Pad Thai with chicken is the best I've ever had. Fresh, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. Their Yupha's Fried Rice is delicious with the pineapple compliments. Their Red Curry gets a 2 star rating for just being Red Curry (it's not as creamy, fresh, or flavorful as Thai Basil on University). It's a neighborhood gem and I'm lucky enough to live right around the corner from Yupha's Thai Kitchen!

Also, it's clean, bright, and has an inviting ambiance. It's perfect for a sit in casual dining experience, and even nice for takeout. 

Staff is friendly and attentive. 

Come here. Seriously."}
{"text":"This place is so tasty! I love going for lunch because you get the all you can eat soup and salad bar. First off the salad is delicious using kale and many other veggies plus you top it off with a wonderful peanut dressing! The veggie soup is pretty basic but still good. I ordered phat prik khing and it was so good and fresh and came out the perfect spice level of hot. My husband ordered the pad gra pow Thai hot and he loved it! Service can be a little slow at times but no big deal compared to the food you're getting. The lunch portion is kind of small but with the soup and salad you'll leave there feeling stuffed and happy! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This busy little restaurant  is located near the theatre on the southeast corner of Elliott and Mc Clintock Rd.
They serve up some delicious Thai salads and TomYum soup in the flaming bowl along with  appetizer samplers.   The seating is a little bit cramped and since there is no designated sections it can get noisy and chaotic at peak times.  If that is your cup of tea, then more power to ya...the waitress/ service can vary from extremely helpful to apathetic and standoff-ish. 
We have had to send back a couple of plates due to errors ... but they always replace correctly.
Yupha the owner always makes things right.
A bit pricy for the amount of food given. 
That being said I am sure they will be here for years to come, as the younger crowd seems to love this place.  As for me, I will re review at lunch to see if it is any better.   The green curry with seafood was decent ,but I have had much better at C**n in Chandler.   
Come here if in the area, but don't expect the red carpet to be rolled out and trumpets blaring.
3 stars
UPDATED. 11/10/17
We decided to give them another Friday night try.
Again they were buried with customers and to go orders.  There was a birthday party and every table was being used.  We waited for about 10 minutes then were offered  a nice corner table .
The salad was delicious and the TomYum soup spot on.   The owner was there and attended to us since I 3 starred them last time .  It was a bit annoying though as she kept asking again and again if the salad was ok. 
A better experience but still not a 5 star place in my opinion.   Too crowded too noisy.   Not for me 
Good wait staff this time though.

{"text":"Yupha Thai is definitely a \"yuppy\" in terms of being a great spot to go to.  There are not too many places to eat near ASU Research Park, which is right off the 101 and Elliot.  Yupha is about a couple miles west on Elliot off the 101 freeway.  

I entered in and saw the special of the day, which was a pumpkin dish with whatever meat or tofu.  Most Thai dishes are known to be pretty spicy, and I was curious to try something more on the sweeter end.  It was still right after Thanksgiving, and it was an appropriate time to try a festive dish.

While I was waiting, they offered us a soup and salad bar to get something to appease us for a few minutes.  This is the first time I have ever seen this, which is the main reason this rating goes from a 4 to a 5 star.  

The pumpkin dish was really good!  The thai spices to go along with the sweetness was the ultimate complement.  All of my friends loved their meals too."}
{"text":"We ordered take out. While picking up the food, I also noticed that the ambience was nice. Overall, the food was very good. Their panang curry was awesome. Pineapple fried rice (Yupha's fried rice) was very tasty and my daughter enjoyed it. I am giving them a 4 star because the Crispy Spring rolls were not good and their drunken noodles could have been better( my wife orders only this item in all the Thai restaurants we have been to). I have had GOOD crispy spring rolls only in very few Thai restaurants. Most of them taste obvious that they use frozen spring rolls. I am not sure about what these guys used but it was not that great."}
{"text":"I had Red curry (added avocados) and coconut ice cream with sticky rice. It was the absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"This was the best lunch I have ever had at Yupha's. Great service, delicious smoky fried rice with delicate tofu, crispy orange chicken and soup & salad. Good prices and quick lunchtime turn-around. You can order your food as mild or spicy as you care to go here and that's a good thing. I don't know a lot of Thai restaurants that work for me, but this one surely does. Thanks Yupha's!"}
{"text":"I don't know how it's possible that I haven't written a review for Yupha's already because it is by far my favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix. Their food is so delicious and flavorful. And they don't skimp on the spice. Their hot level is actually really spicy and they even have a level above it that they call \"Thai hot\". I also really like the cute and colorful décor and laid back atmosphere. Just be aware that they close at 9pm sharp on weeknights.

My favorite dish is the drunken noodles. I just love the sweet and tangy flavor of the sauce and the yummy wide rice noodles. And they make it with plenty of fresh veggies in there too. My husband really likes the Crying Tiger. If you are a steak lover then this is your best option. Most of the other items you can get with your choice of chicken, pork, tofu, or seafood. Last time I was there I went with a couple friends and they wanted curry but I don't usually like Thai curries because I don't care for the taste of coconut milk in savory dishes. So we tried the Pad Prik Khing (#302) and it was fantastic. We got it medium but next time I am going to try it hot! We also tried the papaya salad which is probably something I wouldn't have ordered on my own but it was very good and we all really liked it! The dressing was very light and had that Thai sweet/sour/umami flavor too it and I loved the crunchy texture from the peanuts. I have also tried a couple of their soups and they are awesome. I usually finish the meal off with the mango and sticky rice dessert but last time they didn't have it because mangos are out of season. The mangos they serve with this are sooo sweet an juicy so I guess that is why they only offer it seasonally. So, instead we tried the fried banana with ice cream which was just ok. Too much honey for my taste.

If you are a Thai food lover like me then you can't go wrong with Yupha's. The service is not always perfect but the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great food but not happy with the food price increase.  I most likely will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"Smiles from the moment we walked in, great energy from the employees, AMAZING food. I wasn't able
to catch the name of our waitress, but she was delightful. Very sweet and personable. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated with a laid back feel. A bit of a drive from me, but it is very worth it!"}
{"text":"To keep it short:
We didn't ask for check, still eating but the waitress brought us the check, she was rude because when we complain that why we have to wait 15 minutes to order she said there is nothing she can do.


Food was good
Dessert was good

For such a low service the prices are too high."}
{"text":"The food is good.  I really enjoyed my vegetarian Pad Thai.  The portion size was small, however.  The price charged for what you receive is just not on par with what most other Thai places give you.

I liked that the bathroom had UV light under the hand dryer.  That shows me they care about reducing the spreading of germs.  Or they just like cool looking stuff!  

The service was just okay.  I did not see our server at all after our food was delivered.  We could have used some refills on our drinks at some point during the meal since we ordered our dishes \"Thai Hot.\"  We had to flag down another server.

Maybe it is because I came here for dinner, but I don't see what all the fuss is about.  I see a lot of people come to Yupha's for lunch.  Maybe I will try that next!"}
{"text":"Foods always good. Staff is always friendly. My fave is the pad prik king. My girlfriend says their pad thai is the best she ever had. They give you a yummy kale salad and soup with their lunch menu."}
{"text":"Best Thai food i've ever had and the staff is super friendly. It's the perfect combination of authentic and Americanized - meaning it tastes good but there aren't chicken feet and other weird parts in the food, and the staff understands english and is well versed in allergy and ingredient information. Plus they are fast and professional!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 5 years now and I bring a group of 20 to 30 in about once a month.  They are awesome for a group and they do split checks for us. My favorite was pad see yew but I recently tried the Yuphas fried rice and it is now my favorite."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday evening, place was quiet and very clean. I love their decorations and design of the restaurant. Cozy place to sit and enjoy the food.

My friend and I ordered the drunken noodles (since everyone bragged about it), tom yum hot pot, and a beef salad. I wasn't very impressed by the drunken noodles since its too sweet on top and when I dig into the bottom it was a little too salty. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it but probably won't order it again. The Tom yum soup was flavorful, maybe cause I like my food spicy and sour. The soup could use a bit more meat in it. As for the beef salad, it was fresh but the meat could use a bit more flavor. Ordered two side of rice to eat with our soup and I was surprised that they charge $1.50 for a scoop of rice each. Maybe .75-$1 would be a decent price for it but $1.50? I'm not stingy when it comes to food, but for that price they should at least gave me a full bowl, not a small ice cream scoop of it. Overall, the bill came out to about $32 for all the food and rice, not bad. 

Service was decent since it was not busy. The waitresses sat in the middle of the restaurant talking in their native language and only look up when you call for them. Overall, my waitress was attentive enough and friendly, and you won't have to ask for water refills because they bring out a pitcher along with the cups right when you are seated. 

I'd go there again whenever I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I took a friend here the other day who claims 'no one can make it too hot' for him; he ordered the red curry and they made it 'tripple hot' just for him. 

I watched closely as he took every bite.....is that? is it?? yup. Those are tears....and then, the sniffles began.....and then the stealing of his wifes mildly spiced food and more and more sips of cold water.....yes, I believe, I actually believe...he has been conquered and will PERHAPS gloat no more.....

....and for THAT (besides the yummy, delicious food and GREAT service), 
Yuphas deserves 5 stars :)"}
