{"text":"Amazing food. You can't go wrong no matter what you order. Love this place! Love the wings...French dip...and burgers are delish and fresh. Definitely recommend Sub Zone."}
{"text":"Great little sub shop in the old Quiznos across from Lee Lee Market/next to LA Fitness.  I went by there a few weeks ago looking for the Quiznos and was pleasantly surprised to find out it became a locally owned business. 

I talked to the owner for a while - he used to own a deli for 15 yr so has great connections for getting quality meat and it really showed.  I've eaten the Italian sub several times and it was very tasty.  Quality ingredients that blow any of the standard chains away.  I plan on adding this to my regular restaurant stops."}
{"text":"Stopped here yesterday and was really surprised the staff was great but the food was better. I was really looking forward to eating there today. But was surprised that 2 hours before the closing time on the door I was told they are closed (different staff) nothing on the door saying they were closing early very disappointed. Went back and the original staff from my first visit was there. Stopped in and just like my first visit awesome. Great service and the food was awesome. As long as this staff is here I will keep coming back"}
{"text":"Under new ownership, though I never tried the place under the previous ownership. I knew it must be good based on the number of regulars coming over from the car dealerships. I ordered a burger to go for my wife, she loved it. The fries were still crispy when I got them home, the burger was juicy and flavorful. They have a large menu, their specialty seems to be the cheese steak sandwiches. Next time."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Pre-sliced meats and cheeses...better off making a sandwich at home."}
{"text":"Nice couple running a cool little
Sub shop. Good prices. Good alternative to subway."}
{"text":"Went in today and there is a new name (Grinder's) and owner. The owner spoke with myself and another patron and was very interested in our opinions and if we were local. He seemed eager to please. I got the Italian Combo sub and it was pretty tasty. The owner said the menu will probably be changing a bit soon, but the only specific I got was that he was planning to go with an all Boar's Head offering. The place needs a little love, but he said he'd only been at it for 3 days and it happened rather suddenly, so they are trying to hit the ground running."}
{"text":"The best mom and pop sub shop ever! The bread is so fresh and the quality of meat is awesome! Best of all is the pricing. You can get a 6\" sub, chips and drink for only $4.99 oh and they have BOBA! Check this place out, I bet you will be glad you did!!!!!"}
{"text":"Locally owned sub shop that also sells bubble tea and coffee drinks!  We came here initially looking for Quiznos but found that Sub Zone is here instead.  The deli meat here and veggies are very fresh, and the owners take pride in using high quality ingredients.  I was hoping to get a Quizno's type sub with premium veggie ingredients such as guacamole and mushrooms, but veggies here are more of the standard type you'd see at Subway.  The bubble tea option is new here, but I know that the tapioca used here is fresh, not frozen.  The owners here are very friendly and want to make you the best meal.  I'll definitely come here again to try more subs."}
{"text":"Stopped by today looking for a quick bite to eat. The service was great, seems like a mom & pop shop and I love locally owned/operated businesses. Gentleman was very friendly. 

I'm not a big bread fan, but ordered on wheat and it was excellent, far better than other sub shops. Food was all really fresh and prices were very good. Only complaint, he was a little light on the toppings, could have been a bit thicker.

Will definitely go again."}
