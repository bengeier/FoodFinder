{"text":"There have been a few restaurants before Palate to try and make it in this space - which is hard to see from the main Pearl Road and hidden in the back - however I think the others went over the top on decor - wasn't there a fountain at one point in the original place?  and finally food quality suffered when diners weren't there to support the prices - 

What Palate has done very well is warm the place up - the couches on the side separated by a wall for diners on the other side is such a nice, comfortable set up - they are talking about offering a Happy Hour soon with some special prices/ offers - 

Servers are knowledgeable about the food being served and wine that should be paired - 

Scallop entry was delicious - the scallops were some of the largest I have seen - yummm!

The menu had something for everyone, steak, lots of fish (my uncle had the salmon and said it was amazing!) then over to pheasant - I like it when a place offers some entrees you won't see on just any menu - 

I read some of the other reviews and think they are a bit harsh - the reality is you aren't dining in NYC - you are in a suburb of Cleveland that in my opinion has lacked some quality choices for dinner - are we really comparing Palate to the bar in South Park mall?  There is no comparision - the GM is such a nice guy - made it a point to come out and talk to our table - overall we had a wonderful evening with family/ friends!  Definitely would recommend  to others - and definitely worth a try - keep your expectations realistic - it is clearly one of the BEST options in the southwest suburbs of the city - enjoy!"}
{"text":"We went for a NYE dinner, which was several days after they opened.  Its in a decent location, however a little hard to find because its in the back of the plaza.

We ordered:
1) Mache pit salad - OK, the vinegar and honey were a little out of balance (too much vinegar).  Wish they would have just stuck with natural lemon juice to provide the acid.  The honey was awesome though :)  Scraped the bowl clean of that stuff.

2) Goat cheese 'salad' - this is really two breaded pieces of goat cheese on top of some micro greens.  Portion is large.  Preferred the mache salad.

3) Chicken livers - why must every new restaurant in Cleveland feature this on their menu?  We tried it anyways, after youve had em elsewhere, these were just the same.  Wish they would break the livers up into smaller pieces, the texture can get monotonous with such large pieces.  

4) Scallops - yum!  Flavor of this is great, the combo of the apple, lentils and scallops is really delicous and something different.  Wish they paid more attention to the cooking/cleaning of the scallops- had sand in every bite and rather uneven sears (some scallops were dark brown and some were completely white).  Also, whats with the panko?  No need for that when the scallops are seared properly.

5) Cavatelli - pasta texture was delicious!  Sauce was OK - kinda watery and unfortunately tasted too much like chef boyardee. 

As for the ambience - not very good.  After factoring in the ambience I dropped it from a 3star to a 2star.  Very 90's decor (especially the chairs) and cavernous white ceiling (paint it black!).  Needs some upgrades. 

Service, however, was awesome.  Our waitress was really nice and helpful, you could tell she sincerely wanted us to have a great time and was happy to work there. 

Id say its worth a try because it is a local establishment and its good to support new business.  I am not sure if we will be back, just because if we go to lolita/amp 150 we can get higher quality food for around the same price.  I think if we do go back, it will be to support local chefs and to try out any new dishes that Palate develops."}
{"text":"I don't have time to write an in depth review, but just wanted to say a few things.  I've been to Palate several times, both for dinner and for their Sunday brunch.  The food has been amazing and the prices are not bad considering the quality.  If I could afford to spoil myself more often, I'd eat there at least once a week.  Hoping to make it to lunch one of these days!"}
{"text":"Hi, we decided to eat lunch here today Thursday February 24, 2011. We were both so disappointed with the food. I ordered the make you own salad, the portion was small, over priced, lettuce was wilted, salad was luke warm, nothing on top considering I choose most of the toppings, plus the grilled chicken was dry and not cooked fresh to order...it had that day old fowl taste to it! I was hoping for bread or a roll with the $9.00 salad...nope! So, I decided to try the spaetzle to see if it was any good, it wasn't! It was pan fried and soaking in oil, I like to try and eat healthy I ate maybe one bite and it was so overly oily that I felt gross! My boyfriend got the vegetarian spicy noodle bowl it was okay nothing special, not filling and had to ask waitress for a spoon. He tried the creme brulee and for $5.00 he got a Barbie doll sized portion, I thought it was cute but not more than a bite for him. We will not be coming back for $30.00 plus tip we both felt it was a waste of money and I honestly could have had a better salad at a Fast Food restaurant and the Thai place Sweet Mango has better prices, portions and flavor in their noodle bowls. We will not be back or recommend Palate to our friends or family."}
{"text":"Palate has closed, which is no surprise. Combine a very poor location with the other issues discussed in my review and it never stood a chance. It's sad because this part of town could really use a quality place."}
{"text":"Great overall experience for Mothers Day brunch. Nice sit down meal with plenty of appealing menu choices. Very reasonable prices, just $50 for brunch for 4 with beverages and some extras. Quick, efficient, friendly service. Great food made with fresh ingredients. Nice, classy decor, not what you might expect based on the location. Can't wait to try dinner!"}
{"text":"* Unfortunate for us that Palate was recently written up in a July 2011 issue of \"Cleveland Magazine\" & it didn't even occur to us that they'd already be out of biz 
* Unfortunate for us that I didn't have yelp access to back up the great reviews in the mag cuz then we'd have seen somebody yelped \"Closed\"
* Unfortunate for us that Palate's voice message simply stated that we should leave a message rather than advising us that they were temporarily closed. 

BOOO."}
