{"text":"A Famous Mississauga joint since the early 90's! This place has been around and has a reputation for having some of the best Pakistani dishes! They make fresh tandoori naan right in front of you and fresh seekh kebabs! You can see them grilling your food through a see through glass so you know the food is always fresh. I would highly recommend the Briyani, tandoor chicken and seekh kebab. I also enjoy their saag ( spinach) with butter tandoor naan. The food is amazing but the cleanliness level is what you'd except for any Pakistani restaurant. they need to upgrade their washrooms!"}
{"text":"Like Mary T. commented in her review re: lack of full disclosure and them adding gratuity without informing the customer, and then receiving extra on top...this is my #1 complaint as well!  I did not get an itemized list either (assuming that's because they did mess up one of my orders and while I was told - after exchanging some thoughts decently - that they'll cancel it, they went ahead charging me anyway!).  Not only that I was charged more/extra, the food, with the exception of Bihari Kabab and Naan, was tasteless - that included Malai Boti, Chicken Biryani!  Bottom line, I'll be disputing the charges partially with the CC issuer, leaving my own tip intact but asking for the refund of automatically incl. gratuity, and for the wrong order which wasn't supposed to be part of the bill at the end!  Beware...while your food experience may be different, just keep an eye out to save yourself some grief afterwards - My bad for not being able to bring up an argument there because I was with a few  other extended family members and didn't want to create a scene!"}
{"text":"Save your money .. there a lot of other halal options in GTA. Last time I am ever stepping into that place. Below average food , bad service , very pricey. First time we ever walked out of a restaurant without giving a tip ( and my husband never walks out without giving one.. even he was shocked!) Dont bother coming to this palce!"}
{"text":"we went here firstly in 2011,soon we landed in canada, by believing that we will get the same taste and flavour for what this resturant is famous for in back home..opps.totally disappointed. then recently visited in 2016 by thinking, may be things are better now. but i admitt BBQ tonite is constant in maintaining the same experience as we had in 2011.only good thing,they renovated the intrior atleast.but quality and quantity is very poor( for those who knows what is taste means)."}
{"text":"Went here with my Dad because we heard they had decent Biryani. Coming from a mughal background, we enjoy good biryani. This place delivered and the portion was more than satisfactory. We also tried the seekh kabobs, and those were very tender and flavourful. The service was also great, with the waiters constantly checking in on us."}
{"text":"Portion was huge but taste was not great at all, didn't taste like biryani at all. They had 15% discount if you pay cash but they didn't apply it stating it was for the previous day even though the ad was still on the wall and no date was mentioned on it."}
{"text":"No stars for this one. What a mess was this place! We called for reservation and they didn't take any. We went there and the wait was 30 min, after waiting for 45 when we complained how people coming after us were being seated and served they said that they he reserved! And after every 15 min the said 15 more. We decided to leave the place. No customer service no respect and a horrible place to eat. Food might be nice but the ambience and employees have completely ruined it."}
{"text":"Must try the biriyani .... Wowww wat a flavour , similar to hyderabadi biriyani . I ordered lamb biriyani , it was outstanding , Kebab's are ok here ."}
{"text":"Went there tonight with my family. Our booth seat was full of fruit flies which were constantly flying around us and other guests. Told the manager . Manager did nothing. We paid full price even though there were bugs flying into our food. Management had no regard for the fact that there are lots of fruit flies and little insects. Disgusting experience. I suggest not going. I'd give 0 stars but that's not even an option. Oh forgot to add..manager was walking around with some sort of insense smoking the whole restaurant which actually smelled like bug spray. Who knows. DISGUSTED. I don't even want to know what's happening in the kitchen"}
{"text":"I think it not that dirty place, compare to other indian resturants.. Food is Yammy, love the kabobs and rice. Sure 5 star"}
{"text":"So far terrible service here.. lets see how the food is.. waiters dont care to even bring water.."}
{"text":"Hands down best Biryani and seekh/ Reshma kababs. The place is small with very little parking , the food is made fresh and open kitchen concept is cool   The curries are just ok nothing to go crazy about and some of the dishes are just average.   I would say the top 3 things to order and probably the only things to order here are   1. Chicken or Lamb Biryani  2. Chicken Reshmi Kabab or Beef Seekh Kabab 3.  Tandoori Quarter leg   I feel take out is better than sitting in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I did not regret this suggestion from a friend.  The staff is friendly, service is good, nice place, but  most of  all the food was delicious. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I had Bihair Kabobs and the Karahi Chicken curry we ordered these two items on the recommendations of the waiter.   I personally didn't like the bihair kabob it was a bit dry to my taste and the flavour wasn't strong. The meat was very soft though almost felt like a meat paste not at all like regular meat texture, there was no bite to it, it just fell apart as soon as you touched it. it was a very unique kabob nothing like I've ever tried before so I can see why the waiter said it was his favourite. but it just wasn't to my taste.  the karahi chicken curry was very good but there were so many bones in it and little meat. so I have to give it a 3 stars  lastly the garlic naan is by far the superior naan. If you're going to get naan, make sure its the garlic naan.  4 stars  The prices are very reasonable and for that reason I will come again and try out some of their other dishes to raise the star rating."}
{"text":"One of the finest Pakistani food joint in Toronto Area! Love their Tandoori Chicken and Chicken Boti... And their chick peas curry is out of this world!!  They have an awesome weekend Breakfast menu which is very affordable to go with the family. :)"}
{"text":"Being a big fan of Indian food, and having eaten at almost all of the Indian restaurants in the GTA, I have no doubts in saying that this place is a mother of all.. literally all!  :)   This is not really a fancy place to dine, but end of day what really matters is the food we get, and i have to acknowledge this is the best ever India food you could ever taste. Almost all of the BBQ dishes are amazingly delicious, Lamb/chicken biryani is a must have. Yummyyy! .. and all the curry's with naan are a delight .. so to sum to all .. FIVE BIG STARS !!"}
{"text":"I have been visiting this place for around 3 years whenever I get that Indian food craving. Their lamb biriyani and butter chicken are the best I have tasted in Toronto/Mississauga. The Kabab platter is good as well and easily serves 4. Everything else on the menu is so-so. The place is very busy during lunch/dinner hours on weekdays/weekends. Expect at least an hour wait on weekends. However, it's much faster if you takeout and the takeout quantity is more than dine in. By far the best place to get good Indian food in Mississauga.  They recently opened a new branch on Dixie Rd which seems to have better ambience. Whether food tastes the same at the new branch is still to be seen"}
{"text":"Best biriyani in GTA. We go here all the time and have never come out disappointed. The Hakeem they prepare during Ramadan season is something we look forward to every year"}
{"text":"This is not a bad choice if you are craving Pakistani food.  Especially the chargha chicken, kebabs, karahi chicken and naan all great.  Price is ok too - higher than take out joints. Service could be better, servers seem a bit confused at times and the place could be a bit cleaner, but that is unfortunately expected in these kind of restaurants.  I would go again for the food."}
{"text":"I didn't give it five stars because as others have pointed out, it's not a clean restaurant. But the food is absolutely amazing. First tip, do not order salad, although it comes as a side with many dishes.   The Naan is freshly baked and goes well with all their currys and kebabs. Friends have ordered the curry and been happy all the time. Another friend ordered the seafood dish and was impressed. The beriyani is huge and can easily feed two people.   I have tried their Bihari and Afghani Tikka and they are amazing. Also for exotic food lovers, they serve Maghaz Masala, which is sheep's brain mixed with spices. I had tried sheep's brain many times before, but my friends were very hesitant at first. With first bite, they were in love.  Update: I am not a fan of chicken breast, but Chicken Boti was very tender and delicious."}
{"text":"Best dish on the menu has gotta be Lamb Biryani. Authentic Hyderabadi preparation."}
{"text":"Food Quality was good 4star Parking was not available for few minutes Waited for about 1 hour to get table and 25 to 35 minutes to get food on the table, you can't even ask for your food status before 25 min. (it was told that its restaurant policy) Better to order online and pickup your food"}
{"text":"Good food. Not so clean dining room. This place is not well kept at all. I dont think i will return."}
{"text":"My review is mixed because the restaurant definitely has its pros and cons.   Summary:  Pros: food  Cons: everything else  I ate here with my family on Saturday November 4 2017. There were 6 of us. We made resos and walked in promptly at 8 pm.   When we walked in I asked that we be seated at a booth and the guy tells me sorry those are reserved. I insisted so they took us to a corner booth and the waiter walked away saying happy now ??? I didn't make a big deal but he had a smirk when he said it. To start they sat us at a table that had only 2 glasses. I ignored it because I had insisted on moving there.   I think they were very short staffed. No one came to take our order for 15 mins. We ordered drinks, Keema naan, chicken biryani, palak, Lahore fish, Reshmi kabobs, garlic naan, plain naan and butter chicken.   They told us it would take 40 Mins for the food to arrive. She set the expectation so we weren't bothered about this wait time.   When our food finally came, they brought everything but the biryani and drinks. Twice we reminded our waitress she said oh yea. Looks like they forgot or didn't add to the order. She comes back and tells us they are out of all drinks. No Coke nothing except crush and Pakola. My dad settled for crush.   Our biryani came when we were done eating. Sad but true. What's worse is we saw waitress take coke cans to other tables. Horrible.   Horrible service overall. Honestly this review won't matter much because the food is good and not to be stereotypical there really is no standard of service at most DESI restaurants. Anyway they lost me as a customer."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. This place is always rammed so during dinner rush you feel like you are at a flea market but the food is totally worth it. Good for takeout and eating in the comfort of your home."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great prices ! Sheek Kabab and Beef Nihari were excellent ! Place is busy and crowded ....not a fine dining experience but will deginitely be returning there for the Kababs :-)"}
{"text":"This would be a 2.5 stars location but the food is 4 stars!  The place is great for meat lovers... as the meat is grilled to the perfect level using charcoal and you can see them cooking live.  I have tired their Seekh Kabab with hot Naan. The Kabab was made from ground beef marinated in awesome spices over open charcoal fire. The food is great and enjoyable.  The place is where the location lost 2.5 stars... The tables were still dirty, the carpet is worn down and the restaurant needs a uplift. The outside seating area is covered by a old dirty furniture. Certainly, this will not be a place you visit for the atmosphere and looking at the surrounding I would question the hygiene of the restaurant.  All in all food is great but the place not so much!  For my Muslim folks -They serve halal meat"}
{"text":"I love Indian food - so I'm always up to try out a restaurant, even if it's a bit out of my way (I'm in Pickering and this place is in 'Sauga...)  First impressions: very small and VERY busy. We went on a Saturday evening, so of course it would be busy, but there were people lined up to get in, and then lined up again to get a table. The parking lot is a disaster; if you can park across the street, I'd suggest you do it. We came in three cars and two of them got parked in because other customers simply thought it was OK to double-park and block us in!  This isn't a fancy restaurant, by any means. It's pretty clean (although I didn't venture into the washrooms) but the set-up is basic, and the tables are all stuffed in close to each other, so be prepared for loud conversations and families all over the place.  The Food: The winning dish at this place is definitely the kebabs: we ordered the BBQ platter that had a sampling of pretty much every kebab and it was delicious. For about 40 bucks, it fed seven of us with some left over. Some other dishes we ordered included: -chicken biriyani (it was ok; not enough actual rice though) -butter chicken (not greasy which is AWESOME, but way too sweet) -chana masala (tasty!) -and a whole load of regular and garlic naan (note: the BBQ platter comes with some naan too, which was great) I did like that the dishes were cooked with care - but there was nothing that really made any of them stand out. The best part was probably that nothing was too greasy, or a rip-off in terms of meat-to-vegetable ratio (looking at you, Lahore Tikka House...)  They had no desserts to speak of and we were all craving kulfi, so that was a bit of a let-down. Places do run out of items, but it seemed strange that they would be out of their main dessert so early in the evening on a weekend.  Pricing was fair and all dishes are family style. The portions were decent (in comparison to other Indian places), but if you have a large crew, you'll need two rice dishes, if that is your staple.  Service: slow. We got our food fairly quickly to begin, but we had to ask for water several times. Once a server came by, he took all our pitchers and left, never to be seen again. A few of our dishes were cleared before we asked (because they wanted us to leave) although there was still plenty of food left that could have been packed up.   Overall: I'd come back here only if I was in the west end and had nowhere else to go immediately after (as another user noted; you will reek of Indian food after being in here for 10 minutes, and it will linger.) There are lots of Indian places to try, so I think I'll check out somewhere new next time."}
{"text":"Best Biryani in Mississauga for dine in:) Ask for \"Mirchi ka salan\" with biryani if you want to experience authentic Hyderabad style biryani.  Visited for lunch. I've been here for dinner as well but sadly there's a long wait on weekends. They should open up the patio and seat ppl there indeed of using it as waiting room. But I'm sure it's got something to do with the city."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from this place for last 6 months or so and haven't been ever disappointed with the quality and taste of food.. During the most stormy night and specially when everybody was in closing state, they still managed to give us biryani's as the kitchen was already closed. Appreciate their gesture. We have tried almost all of their chicken dishes and they are pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Bbq food? Whats not to love? Havent been here in a while but the food was great when we did go. Really delicious"}
{"text":"Decided to drop in for lunch at Bar B Q Tonights new location. We were seated immediately. The service was friendly but not really responsive.  We ordered the sheekh kabab and butter naan. The sheekh kabab was delicious and flavoursome, coupled with a hot and freshly prepared naan, the combination was amazing.  Then came the lamb biryani. The rich and aromatic flavor of the biryani in this restaurant is what sets it apart. This is as close as it gets to a real Hyderabadi Biryani.  The main aspect of a biryani besides its taste and flavor is the meat itself. Which was quite disappointing. Most of the meat I was served were chunks of fat. This totally turned off the biryani aficionado in me.  The whole point of a biryani is lost without a good serving of meat."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Biryani!  The best Biryani in town. The mutton biryani is the best. We order quite a lot of trays from his place for our parties.    The only concern is I've tried dining in and it was terrible the ambience is very bad and the bathrooms are untidy. I've tried the Dixie location and I think that place is much better than the one on Mississauga.   Any one who loves Biryani this is your new home!!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite restaurant in Mississauga.  I go so often my clothes smell of tandoor. I rave about this place to all my friends and family.  I've had pretty much everything on the menu several times and I'm never disappointed.  The best Bihari kabob, reshma kabob, garlic naan, and chicken tikka you can find.  Takes awhile since everything is made fresh and to order.  I can wait hours for this food and I do.  I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"You have to consider this place in the context of its main clientele, working / middle class Pakistani families. And as far as I could tell, they love this place. There are few places in Mississauga that have a 30min wait time on a Monday at 10pm for dinner. Also when Pakistani people go to eat bbq in Pakistan, things like table service and clean plates and health code compliance are not really things that exist in a meaningful way. So this place by comparison is amazing.  If you go, expect a lot of crying babies being comforted by there mothers or mothers who don't give a shit and are done comforting there babies. Large families, in mean like 20 people taking over large parts of the restaurant, people on interracial dates, and families taking visiting  grandparents out for dinner  The food is basic Pakistani BBQ, and it's not the best in the world but it's very likely some of the best in town. It would have to be, as Pakistani people do not tolerate bad food on a family night out.   We had the Kat-a-Kat, seekh kabob, tikka and Bihari kabob, all where good. the tikka was a little dry but that's pretty had to get right.   All in all it's an entirely authentic experience, not the only possible authentic experience but one of them. If you don't like this place maybe try Lahore tikka house on Gerard it's not much better or much worse."}
{"text":"Last year visiting Mississauga from Chicago we had ordered biryani take out which was just great so this time I made it a point to do the same, so we ordered on line Biryani Kababs and boti, Nans, we went 1 hr late to pick up, was told that it will be another 15 minutes which turned into an hour so I picked up food which looked less so in the car I checked was the wrong order so went back he gave me another order which I checked outside again it was wrong so third time I checked inside restaurant, the guy in front Mr Jibran dealing with the order had no remorse or apology as if saying that I should be grateful that I got my order after 2 hrs, would have been ok if the food was ok but it was not. Boti was so hot, Biryani had more cardamom and black pepper  than the rice, I was highly disappointed.  This place is so overcrowded and full of smoke that you can hardly see another person which I would have overlooked had the food been any good, amazing the health department don't site them, this was the last time I will go to this place"}
{"text":"This review applies for the take out food section only. I was invited by some friends to  try this spot at their place.  I was intrigued as this spots claim to fame is authentic BBQ from the land of the pure (Pakistan). I was lucky enough to tag along for the pickup. The initial impression I got was this is your typical any town Canada restaurant with a nondescript exterior. When one goes in your impression does change as they have an open kitchen which can be a bad thing if you ask me. In the few minutes I spent there I found the place to be quite hot and ambiance is not particularly inviting (read this is by no means a fancy place).  The smell of spices does permeate the air so if you are not used to it be prepared.  I had a chance to pick up their menu and found it to be quite authentic and full of Pakistani BBQ dishes (without opening a Pandora box read there were quite a few beef dishes here as opposed the other BBQ places you visit in from sub continent)   My hosts had pre-orded the following Bihari Kebab, Reshmi kebab, chana masala, raita, salad and some nans. Bihari Kebab (beef) was the star here very authentic with the melt in the mouth feel as the meat was marinated and spiced very well. Full marks here. Reshmi Kebab (ground chicken) was OK but I am not a fan of this kebab as ground chicken IMO doesn't belong on the grill. Devoid of much taste but its due to the meat being used and not due to the lack of spices.  Not my cup of tea.  Chana Masala was quite hot and made everyone reach for the water half way. I enjoyed this dish as they didn't pull any punches here and this one packed a wallop quite authentic IMO.  Nan bread were just so so , I guess the time from the oven to ride home didn't do it justice as this bread is supposed to be eaten fresh. Salad and Raita was just run of the mill stuff. Folks this place is quite authentic and is worth the drive from TO IMO. I will be back to try the other stuff as apparently the fish is quite good and maybe even try the Bar BQ  Tonite platter (yes they do spell it that way on their menu :)  as one can get a bit of everything."}
{"text":"The food here is worth a three . It's very good and big portions. This is More a comment on service. Took about a half hour to be seated, which is fine but it took another half hour for anyone to talk to us about drinks and food. Ok.  Icing on the cake was it literally took an hour for food to come out when we ordered a relatively simple dish. It was good food, however I would not be willing to travel to sauga again for it. Also, they add a service charge of five percent when there was hardly any service or contact. There was constantly a burning feeling in my eyes because of the smoke in the air. They need better ventilation for sure."}
{"text":"The butter chicken and garlic naan is a must here. Its flavourful and even when you are full you want more. They are always super busy so service is slow sometimes when you dine in. I usually order takeout."}
{"text":"Bar B Q Tonite is Indian/Pakistani soul food at its finest. Even though the location underwent a renovation recently, it's still kinda divey. Stay for the the food, not the ambiance; or don't, and pick up your order like most Bar B Q Tonight patrons do. Bar B Q Tonight is usually very busy. Prepare for long waits if you don't call ahead. Also, they have been known to run out of popular items from time to time, so best to check ahead if you can.   The chicken biryani is an absolute must have. At almost $9.00 its a tad pricier than similar joints in the area, but it is to die for and you WILL notice the difference. Kebabs are spectacular, the naans are super fresh and the chicken tikka masala is amazing. I have even catered food from Bar B Q Tonight for a party of 30 people, and every single one of my overly judgmental Indian dinner guests was blown away by the food. There are a few of these Indian/Pakistani joints in the Hurontario and Dundas area, but Bar B Q Tonight comes up on top every time."}
{"text":"Some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Generally, Pakistani and Indian restaurants are notorious for bad customer service (chill, im south asian), but this was totally over the top.   Our wait time was 30 minutes to get a spot, and about 35 minutes for the food to arrive. Had to request multiple times to bring the food. Waiter was rude and condescending.    Now finally, food: mediocre at best. Ive had better kebabs at other places. I ordered the full platter and a rice, it cost me 50 dollars. I could have gone to another restaurant for that price for better service and better ambience.   WOULD NOT RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"This place is horrible, unhygenic and over priced Food. They love to steal meat portions from their customers orders. They r also not very professional cooks. They use old meat in their dishes. I will be complaining about this Resturant to Canadian Food Inspection Agency. We should all boycott this place."}
{"text":"Food poisoning!!!   Might have something with them preparing and cooking food outside in the back as kitchen overflow.   Even absent being sick the day after, food was just decent. Chicken on skewers was way over cooked. Curry was sitting in oil. $13 Biryani was mostly white rice with little drabs of meat. Naan not made in a tandoor.   Finally, apathetic service."}
{"text":"I loved this place, I have seen it for years but never went in because it's always sooooo busy   Today it wasn't as busy so I ran in   I got the lamb biryani and chicken boti & garlic naan  it was amazing , it starts with a free garden salad   And the food came out shortly after   the naan was loaded with fresh garlic & the chicken came out on a hot skillet with sizzling onions and lime   Highly recommend this place - you can order for take out too"}
{"text":"Awesome Pakistani/ Indian food- it was very tasty and filling. I love how the kabobs and chicken cutlets were sizzling when they came to our table.   The service was very good and attentive.   I would give it five stars, but the locations is not in a good area of Mississauga, and the restaurant, although decent, could be a little cleaner and have more personality."}
{"text":"Although the location itself is small and tight - the food and service was good.   It seems as if the location is always filled with people, the tables and walls are not the cleanest.   The food however was REALLY good - the kabobs, naan, butter chicken and chicken boti were absolutely delicious. The service was also good, not amazing but good.   I'd recommend taking the food home and enjoying it."}
{"text":"This is our second time going to this location at BBQ tonite.  Although the location is really pretty and designed well, we found that the service could have been much better. I went with my family two weekends ago and upon arrival we were seated right beside the washrooms and this table where the servers were keeping dirty plates, cups and menus.   We already had a few menus on our table but I asked for a few more as there was six of us - to my surprise we were given attitude for asking for a few more. On top of that, what was really disgusting was the napkins that had curry stains on it.   When the food came it was pretty good, my only complaint is that the butter chicken didn't have a lot of chicken in it.   It was really hard to get a servers attention and you could tell that the servers were flustered as they were grouping together to discuss customers and what was going on with other coworkers.  Other than that we actually did enjoy the food however because of the service, I am not sure that we would go back there again."}
{"text":"The real taste of Pakistani BBQ, little expensive but food worth it. Decent and Excellent customer service. Must try chicken tikka, Bihari kebabs, nihari, Lahori fish, and brain masala. Only one problem is the music was too loud.  Do reserve table before you go otherwise you need to wait few hours or minutes. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Absolutely love the Butter chicken, seekh kebab, Lahori fish, chicken masala, and the garlic/buttered naan! Honestly the best butter chicken I've ever had. I always find myself craving BBQ Tonite."}
{"text":"Average food .. good service .. lamb biryani was good, bihari kebabs lacked all the bihari kick (as a weekend passion chef, I can beat their chef anytime on bihari kebabs) .. chapli kebabs were too packed like a shami kebabs .. reshmi was regular seekh kebabs .. fish was basa (never accepted basa as a fish, other than some kind of a white meat) masala on it was good .. chicken boti was nice, and the chicken tikka masala was nicely done, apart from the tandoori after taste. Rotis were great .. not sure if it can be a usual spot for me and my family. Dining area needs ventilation direly."}
{"text":"Ordered kebabs to go for tasting only. Flavors were typical south east Pakistani style with abundance of aromatic spices and coarse ground chili peppers a typical for this region.  The place was clean and the staff was nice , might eat here again when in need for Pakistani style of food."}
{"text":"I usually don't go to Pakistani/Indian food restaurant ls as my mom makes better food. I came here because if a family event, 15 of us in total.    The first thing I noticed were the prices. They seemed fairly cheap to me: most dishes were around $10. We ordered about $250 worth of food, which was way more than needed. We ended up taking 25% of the food home.  The highlight was their kebab platter for four ($40). It contained a variety of meat (chicken seekh kebab, beef seekh kebab, chapli kebab, fish) and four  naans. There naans are massive and tasty.   The other high light was their maghaaz which had great Masala and was cooked well.  The downsides was that their curries and their chargha were not good at all. We had pretty much 2 full chargha left out of 3 that we ordered. It was extremely over cooked."}
{"text":"I along with my husband came on a trip to Canada all the way from New York and went to this restaurant for having dinner. So far the best biryani I had after being to USA. In USA we have a lot of indian restaurants in all states, but in Canada, in this place you will get a typical Pakistani flavor biryani which we get in India so called dum biryani !! And we tried reshmi kabab which tasted perfect. I really suggest this place for indians who wants a good spicy biryani. Thing I don't like is, it looks like a dhaba and not very clean. Other than that food is too good. Will visit Canada one more time atleast to try this biryani again !!"}
{"text":"Food quality is awesome. Biriyani is a must.. They should try to expand and improve the ambience considering the rush."}
{"text":"The food here deserves a 5 star. It is extremely delicious. Best items in my opinion are the chicken tikkah masala, behari kabab(not as good as cafe d khan but still pretty good), khata khan and reshmi kebab.   The reason for giving it 3 stars is because the ventilation is really bad in the resturant and u end up smelling of Indian food by the time you leave.  It is really busy even in weekdays so expect some wait. They also do take out and it takes them 30 mins to get the food ready.  This is the option I like as i don't end up smelling like Indian food and yet get to eat yummy food!!!"}
{"text":"A shack from the outside but this is a hole in the wall place where quality food is served. Watch out for the potholes in the parking lot! Don't come for 7 as this place gets super busy really fast. Best time to come is right before the dinner rush."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for authentic Pakistani and indian (hyderabadi) cuisine and i would rate the biryani the best in GTA.   I tried the kadai lamb with butter naan and lacchha parantha. Though on the spicy side, the mutton is sumptuous and cooked to perfection with perfect blend of spices and the aroma amplifies the hunger.  Chicken biryani is as Hyderbadi as it can get served with mirchi salan, raiti and salad. I have tried the mutton biryani too which is just as good. This place has a good range of beef kebabs and bihari kebab is quite liked. Not really a place for vegetarians though the new branch has a few veggie options on the menu   Recommended : chicken/lamb biryani, seekh kebab, lahori fish  Cost for two : Reasonably priced, about $35 for two."}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic pakistani/Indian food with great service! If you don't order ahead, there will be a wait because the place is always packed! But don't be discouraged, because it will be well worth the wait. The price is extremely well priced  for the quantity and quality of the food! Must visit!"}
{"text":"Entrance is a bit shady with loads of hoard right in your face as you walk towards the entrance. Once you are in, the strong beautiful smells of fresh food hits your sinuses. The kitchen area has a glass see through the seating area so you can watch your chef as they prepare your food.  Tables were uncleaned and there were hardly any customer there so that was a little turn off. But we were greeted and seated quickly.  The washrooms probably get a 2 star rating for not keeping them cleaned. For a desi restaurant, I mean it was okay but certainly better than McDonalds washrooms.  Menu now, it is EXPENSIVE!!! Every freaking item on their menu is double the price you will pay at other places. This was probably the biggest turn off for us. $7 for a qeema naan and $12 for bihari kabab? Are you kidding me? Other dishes were equally priced and the food quantity didn't do justice for the price we paid of the full meal.  The food came fresh in front of our eyes but thr qeema naan wasn't the best. It hardly had any meat on it. Bihari kabab on the other hand was alright. The spices hadn't been marinated fully on the meat but it was just alright.  The owner of the restaurant who sits behind the counter with no smile and taking personal phone calls and discussing personal family matters on the phone in front of customers.  The food I give 3.5 stars and price I give 2 stars and overall restaurant I give 3 stars. I would have no problem giving 4 stars to my review if the qeema naan was $3.99 and bihari kabab $6.99 but you can see that's not the case.  Please see my pictures posted for this restaurant.  Message to the owner and management, please pay more attention to your customers and not your family matters when at work. Keep the washrooms cleaner and tables cleaned faster for better customer return."}
{"text":"The food here was really good since we got the barbecue items but I felt like it was a bit overpriced. We spent about $65 and the only things we got was one barbecue platter and one spinach vegetable item which could have been better. There was a lot of space to accommodate us so that was really nice but it seemed like the service staff was constantly busy because there was not enough of them. There were very very large families that were here mostly immigrants that were all over the place."}
{"text":"Thank God they opened up this new branch. Service was simply amazing. Rohit helped us out with booking and order. he was absolutely amazing in handling customers. Food was on table in just 15 minute after we ordered. He was continuously asking us about that if any thing else was needed and that helped in quick service."}
{"text":"OK here is the truth, is there food good, it is. But not good enough to compensate for the rude staff and horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Finger-licking food; keeps bringing us back again and again. Their Nihari & Hyderbadi biryani is the best in town and the Kebab platter mmmmmmmm. Service is slow but that's because the food is made from scratch. The servers are so humble and un-pretentious, especially Kobe; he's such a sweet kid! Love the family friendly ambience here but do leave your coats in the car, the BBQ smell lingers forever."}
{"text":"Amazing food, the Bihari Kabobs are soft and melt in your mouth. The nans are hot and fresh. Try the mint chutney too."}
{"text":"This rating is solely for their food. Normally,  their service would get 2 to 3 stars because it's not exceptional or sometimes not even super friendly but there are good and bad days.   The food is really great. My friend honestly loves this place and he's the one who with the words \"the best food you'll ever have\" that I went with a huge appetite.   First stand out dish and highly recommended is their brain dish, yep you read that right like I did when  I sat down. It was my first time eating brain and it was delicious and well seasoned.   The kabobs and lamb chops were also cooked very well and even cooked well done was still juicy.   I picked every piece of meat off that lamb chop bone!   Their naan comes out warm and their biryani had huge chunks of meat in it. Their fish is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I've been back several times after the initial time and have even got take out; every time the food is spot on.  So go try the amazing food, but don't expect amazing service. Definitely not the best food I've ever had, but definitely the best brain I've ever had :)"}
{"text":"I've been to better Pakistani restaurants - this ones not bad but it's not that clean plus they have major billing issues with surprise surcharges etc. waiters are very unorganized but the food is average."}
{"text":"This place is known for the biryani chicken or lamb take your pick. Tip pay cash and you don't have to pay tax. For $10 you get enough food for two people. Typical Pakistani fare. I just make sure I have a bucket of yogurt at home to cool me down when I eat it."}
{"text":"Biryani is the best Hyderabadi Biryani I have had in Canada so far.  Their Kababs are amazing !!  Whenever I am in Mississauga this restaurant is my first choice!!"}
{"text":"I went there around 9:30, they supposedly close 10:30 and, even though they had few empty tables, I was told they were booked. I sat on my car for 5 min to look for another place.   A very rude guy showed up honking and came to my window give me shit because I was parked in the \"owner and staff parking spot\".   Then I said \"there's no sign, how I'm supposed to know that?\"   And he rudely responded \"I know there's no sign, but now next time you know, don't park there\"  I said \"I'm, for sure, not coming back\"  So even though the reviews about the food are good, if you care about service, this is not the place."}
{"text":"Two words : over hyped.  This restraunt shows its very busy and very popular. Recently opened in an area with many other restraunts around, so it looked promising.   The wait: 35 minute wait for 2 people on saturday late evening time frame. Another 10 minute for drinking glasses for water. Another 25 minute for food.  Food: Chicken Bryani ran out. Ordered lamb Bryani that when it finally arrived tasted old. Seekh kabob was freshly made but it didn't taste that great. It was just average. Chicken tikka boti was nice the spice blend was mild but it was tender.  TL: DR = Overhyped and over priced for food that was just mediocre with a typical taste."}
{"text":"Halal Meat is served here as Owner's are known Muslims. Went here recently for lunch on a weekday.  Smells like Pakistan when you walk in (because of the kitchen being close to the seating). Tried the mixed kabab grill which comes with several different types of kababs including Seekh, Bihari and Tandoori pieces as well as Fried Fish.  All the kababs were good. It also comes with Naan which was buttered (which I like because many places don't do that).  We also ordered Chicken Karai on the side and that was just OK, because the chicken pieces were too large (mostly bone) and hard to eat with naan.  Mango Lassi was good, as it was not too sweet. Overall was pretty good experience."}
{"text":"The food here is very good.  For food alone, it is a 4 star.  Service and general cleanliness of the restaurant is horrible.  I think the last time they cleaned the window sill was 5 years ago.  The health department needs to visit this place."}
{"text":"we went to this restaurant for EID buffet, we were told that this will be a meal to remember, well it turned out to be the meal to remember but not a very good meal to remember.  This buffet was $23/pp and for this money there were total of 7 dished and 2 desert, the BBQ items were only 2 seekh kababs and chicken boti. both of these items were not very good as they had been sitting in the warmer for a very long time it seems like. Chicken qoorma was very watery.   This was a very greedy pricing for a special occasion where so little and sub standard dishes were offered, on top of all that we were charged 15% surcharge. left very bad experience on a special day."}
{"text":"Good Food and Lots of Wait !!  This place has good food but really there's a lot of wait, to that extent that you could be waiting for over an hour. The place is small and cramped up, so would not recommend for groups.   We did take out, placed the order at 0650pm, was told it would take half hour. We ordered Chicken Boti with Butter Naan, Chicken Karahi, Chicken Biryani and 1 Extra Butter Naan.   So I reached at 0745, almost an hour late only to know the order was not ready yet. In the meantime another customer came and was quarreling asking to speak to manager, he was told Nihari was available and an hour later when he came to pick up, he was told its finished and they don't have any.   The wait time for dine in close to 45mins, the staff is cooperative and tries to accommodate to their best. There is no designated waiting area and with the little space, it can be difficult with kids. The parking area is also very small so it's better to park in the opposite the street Centre area. I realized this 20 mins after maneuvering my car around.   Finally After waiting for another 45mins, I got my order. The food was good, Chicken Karahi was great, best was the Chicken Boti, chunks of Chicken Marinated in great spices. The disappointment was the Biryani, didn't like it much, too much cardamom and have had far better ones.   Price wise the place is nominal and the food provides the cost value, just not the time value.   Ambience - 2/5 Food - 3.5/5 Service - 2/5  Would do take out but not recommend for dine in !!"}
{"text":"My favorite Authentic Hyderabadi restaurant.  They make the best biryani and kabobs. The food is always fresh and tastes delicious. Their quality and quantity is consistent. The ambience is great and the staff is courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"Heads up!! This app shows that this place is open till 11:00pm but we reached here at 10:10pm and they're saying that they cannot serve us.   They give take outs order though.   Biriyani here is very delicious. Reminds me of Hyderabad, India. Have Biriyani with chicken Karachi, it goes well in your lungs."}
{"text":"Their kababs are mouthwateringly delicious!!!!  The place is very busy.... you may have to wait in queue for quite long, and the food takes another 20~30 minutes to come to your table. But this wait is definitely worth... the food is delicious!! The tastes are quite different from the other kaboob places in GTA. We ordered Behari Kabab... well-marinated beef, cooked on charcoal fire and served on a sizzling platter. Also had Maghaz Masala (cow brain, cooked with spices), this one is quite rare to find in GTA I believe.   The service is good, the servers are very attentive and prompt. From the parking lot you can get the appetizing aroma of the kababs... I would suggest, take off your jackets and keep them in the car."}
{"text":"This location of the Bar B Q Tonite has opened recently. Conveniently located on Dixie, specious, nicely decorated, with ample parking space in the plaza.   Service is good, servers are polite and helpful. Food is equally good as their other location in Cooksville. The wait time queue can be long. Also consider another 15 - 25 minutes for the food to be served after placing order.  We had Behari Kabab (well marinated beef kabab served on sizzling platter), Magaj Masala (cow brain cooked with lots of spices), Garlic Nan and Butter Nan. Quality, quantity, preparation deserves 4 star!!"}
{"text":"The service is absolutely horrific.  Waiters are like lost puppies. We tried ordering takeout and they hangup on you... And when u call back they pick up and hang up on you agian. I saw the guy put green chutney that was on someone else's table and give the leftovers to other customers.  Tables are dirty... Plates and utensils are dirty, I asked them to change it.    The food is great,  we ordered Lamb biryani and nihari but there was barely any Lamb,  more like bones.  Malsa is really good."}
{"text":"On May 4, 2014 I visited this restaurant for dinner. We were around 12 people including 2 infants. My daughter 10 months old was sitting on the high chair (which didn't had any belt). One lady server came with the hot serving food and she dropped the hot dal on my daughters head. I cleaned the dal with my hand and took my daughter to the washroom to put cold water. We left the restaurant without eating anything. The waitress was un-professional and all this happened and manager was unaware till we mentioned that to him."}
{"text":"Came for late lunch. It was not busy then but were told that restaurant gets really full especially at dinnertime 'coz of Ramadan. We ordered the BBQ platter( yummy:) that came with more than enough pieces of  naan ( freshly- made and soft). The meats were nicely seasoned. My favorite was the chicken which had the most bbq grilled taste.  We shall surely come back to try other items next time. We had a happy meal."}
{"text":"The best Bihari kabab I have ever had. We randomly ended up going to this place without having any expectations and boy, were we pleasantly surprised. The lamb and chicken biryani are also really good. However the Bihari kabab trumps everything. So well done and melts in your mouth. If anyone is looking to try good Pakistani cuisine I would definitely recommend this place. Service could be a little better but it's not horrible."}
{"text":"The food is extremely delicious with the matching aroma. The Garlic (pay to get the upgrade to garlic) NAAN was beyond delicious. The beef/chicken were all BBQ'd & all tasty but the salt was on the high side.    Here's the issue for me...the walls are filthy. They look like the belong in a truckers restaurant. They're all scuffed up & look terrible. The bathroom was the same. Dirty & scuffed up. NOT a good impression on your restaurant. It would take nothing to clean the walls & make the place just \"look better\"! I brought this to the attention of the waitstaff but he was casual in saying they painted every 6 months. I'm afraid I call BS on that. I know what painted 6 months ago looks like & that's wasn't it.   For the apparent lack of cleanliness but the upside of good food, I give 3-Stars but I won't go back."}
{"text":"Service 1* Food 4* Ambiance 3*  The foods great service is horrible.  Ordered an hour in advance for take out and over an hour still no order.  I've been here before because the food is good, but don't expect anything from service. Order Bihari kebob, butter Jaan or reg.  Chicken katakat"}
{"text":"Based on a friends recommendation we went to  BarBQ Tonite,  ordered a platter which is around $43 to 45 , comes with a variety , like fish kebab, chicken and beef. The beef kebabs were good , fish and chicken were okay !! Nan comes with the platter and yogurt (raita) comes with it too.  I wanted to order chicken biryani, so I asked the server if I could try to sample the biryani because I can't eat very spicy food, she said she will bring it but I guess she forgot.   Its a bit pricey and the smell of the food and Masalas is overwhelming."}
{"text":"2.5-3* is about right.  Stopped by to pick up a Chicken Biryani for a potluck with some friends.  (Was going to go to a $5 joint, but the snow prevented me from doing more driving!)  When I told the man behind the counter that I thought the Biryani was a bit expensive, at $8.99, he tried to justify it by saying that they use really high quality rice.  He also said that he wouldn't charge me tax + he included another green chilli oil sauce to add spice to the dish.  He also promised that if I loved their biryani, I'd be back!   I should've eaten more of it, but I thought it was pretty good.  Would I have known the difference between the $5 vs. this place?  Probably not.  Portion was the same size.  Verdict?  Good Chicken Biryani.  Atmosphere itself seems slightly on the dinge-side."}
{"text":"Biryani is excellent and that's the only thing I've ordered from this place. I personally think they're pricy for the quantity as well as the compared to the ambience. The do good business I think is why the phone order takers or cashiers don't care about the way they talk or their service."}
{"text":"They took my order for pick up and asked me to get there in 20 minutes. Arrived there in 20 minutes and they told me that the item was all sold out. They didn't apologies nor compensate with some discount or care about how much time I wasted. Really disappointing with their customer service and highly caution you about their lack of customer care."}
{"text":"We have really high standards for desi food so finding a good place for those lazy days has been an ordeal.  BBQ Tonight is great! Their bihari kababs are absolutely amazing, the karhai is great, nihari is oily but still amazing, and the biryani is hyderabadi style spicy and tangy.  We still have to try other items on their menu but so far our experience has been great."}
{"text":"I love their chicken Biriyani.  Customer service is weak as well as cleanliness of the place.  i am looking forward to their new location in Dixie."}
{"text":"We placed an order for pickup last Saturday night (Chicken biryani, chicken boti and reshmi kababs.) We actually wanted to order the Lahori Fish, but we were told it was unavailable, so we went with the kababs instead.   We called in around 8 pm and were told the order would take 30 minutes. Not a problem, we showed up at the restaurant 45 minutes later - except the order still wasn't ready, and the place was PACKED. There was a lineup of people waiting for tables, another crowd of people waiting for pickup, and it was generally very chaotic. We waited another 15-20 minutes, when finally we were told our order was ready. It was hard to shake the feeling they had missed our order and were rushing to make it up.   As we were about to pick up the order, we noticed a waiter walking by with a sizzling hot plate of... Lahori Fish. When we asked the guy manning the order desk why we'd been told they were out of fish an hour ago, he just shrugged. \"You'd have to check with the person who took your order.\"   I'm not sure we'll be ordering again in future. It's a shame, because the food is decent, but not worth the lackadaisical service. I'd also recommend the restaurant invest in smaller takeout containers for their dishes that are on the smaller-size, portion-wise. A few pieces of chicken boti in a large styrofoam container looks rather sad, no matter how tasty the dish is."}
{"text":"Made a quick stop for lunch with coworkers. There were very few parking spots up front, luckily we car pooled!   Been here a couple of times before. The service received definitely improved! Much more friendly!!   We ordered garlic naan and regular naan, pretty standard quality and cost. We also got the fish pakora, lamb biryani and kebabs. The fish pakora was pretty good, it was my favorite dish hands down. It might have been a little too greasy to some, perfect for me!   Suggestion to the owner. The patio was pretty much used as storage, what a pity. It has good potential to be converted to more dinning space for when the weather is nice.   Overall it was good. I'd go back and try some of the other dishes fellow Yelpers suggested."}
{"text":"BBQ platter was not cooked well, chicken karahi was much better.    Customer service was good."}
{"text":"near to hyderabad biryani but service level is poor.simple menu.well although they give mirchi salam in small wuantity its delicious."}
{"text":"Pathetic service and below average food ! Avoid them if you are looking for Indian food"}
{"text":"Regular at this place. Generally prefer the take out. Their maghaz Masala is awesome. Tried the chicken katakat. It was delicious. Good portions of food. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"At work, our team goes out every Friday for lunch. It's optional, depending on how busy work gets.   We.have lunches to welcome new writers. We also have lunches for folks each month whose birthday falls in said month. These lunches are sponsored by the company.   July was different. We.had a new writer join us in June, but was fasting that month. We also had another writer whose birthday was in June, but was also fasting. A third writer, my longest-serving student, and I have birthdays in July.  I am an organizer and a planner. I got restaurant suggestions from them and asked where they wanted to go. This location won unanimously.   This place opens at noon. We got there five minutes before it opened. They were kind to let us in early.   This place used to be a Greek buffet restaurant. I have never been there. There was a large, odd tin-foiled Mickey Mouse distraction on the wall. Apparently, it was there when the restaurant was Greek.   This restaurant has lunch options. I went with the chicken tikka masala. It came with rice, salad, a potato and veggie mix, and naan.   I wasn't expecting a small plate with some salad shared amongst four people! I kept on referring to it was the communal salad. I was thinking that if you are sharing salad with a number of folks that the restaurant would give you a salad bowl with salad. Not so much here!  The potatoes and veggies were good. My chicken tikka masala was spicy and yummy. The naan helped put out some of the fire. It was delicious.  My longest-serving student can't handle a ton of spice. She ordered the butter chicken and said that it was spicy.   It was a good lunch to spend some time hanging out with my colleagues. On our team, I handle the expenses, so I needed to expense for five of us.   What I didn't like was the lack of full disclosure from the server on how much we had to pay. She showed me on her iPad mini how much the bill would be for five of us, before taxes. I was good. However, after I had paid and got an itemized receipt, she had added a gratuity fee on top of the tip that I had given her.   My manager noticed, once we got back to the office, that he was also charge a gratuity fee for his own meal. He did the same thing and tipped on top of the gratuity.   We were a group of eight. I am okay with a gratuity fee slapped on large groups. However, I didn't see it posted or mentioned to us anywhere.   I would do takeout to try more food. If you like spicy food and small communal salads for groups that should be an individual salad, this place is for you. Just beware of the extra, secretive fees that this place doesn't mention upfront.  (153)"}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Their service is pathetic. Ordered biryanis for a 7:30pm pick up. 2.5 hours later my biryani is still not ready. Absolutely horrible. No1 should ever go here"}
{"text":"There are no pictures in this first review. What does that mean hu'h? We didn't wait. Couldn't wait!  Nondescript location and not the most enticing interior. But the thirty minute wait and busy as bonkers kitchen (oh you can see through the glass) meant we were in the right place.  Absolutely delicious chicken seekh kebabs, one of its kind Karahi Chicken and the fluffiest, garlicky naan. Salad and raita is on the house. Chicken Biryani has the right amount of spices with chicken itself soft enough to fall off the bone by a mere touch!  And, don't forget to sample the amazing Mirchi Ka Saran. This one's a must and not a common item on the menu in GTA."}
{"text":"bbq tonite love the food like chicken biryani it tatse like Hyderabadi.But the only problem is that they should do a buffet system."}
{"text":"There was a brutal wait but it was worth the wait amazing food and friendly service.  Good things come to those who wait."}
{"text":"The only reason I give this a 2-star is because of their food taste and nothing else.   One day, we decided to order food in and get delivery so we called this place and placed our order: Reshmi Kabab, Bihari Kabab, Butter Chicken, lamb chops.  Bill: $53!! Really? Ok, so for paying that much you would expect a lot of quantity, right? NO!! The food was good but the quantity was a waste. The number of items that we ordered we expected a large meal which we could feed guests. Their quantities were so small that 2 people could eat all that food and still have some space left. YES! I'm not kidding. When I opened the containers and saw how much food there was, I was deeply disappointed along with being pissed. I mean, if you pay $53, you expect the quantity to be $53 as well. I didn't order from some 5-star hotel or upscale restaurant. The lamb chops were so tiny that they looked like chicken wings instead. Lambs are not that small.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. If you eat at the restaurant, you get free nan but if you order delivery then they charge for that as well. REALLY?   HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!! For a desi restaurant to charge that much and then cut down quantity like that? They won't last long."}
{"text":"This restaurant doesn't bring great Pakistani food to the GTA, the bring the GTA to Pakistan so there's no need to travel there to taste how real Pakistani food taste!  If you're looking palak puneer, a good daal or a cook that's gonna hold back on the spices for the locals, try another place.   Everything on the menu was amazing from the Bihari kabobs to biryani right down to the eggplant chutney!  Hands down the best Pakistani restaurant in the GTA!"}
{"text":"I ordered the lamb biryani to go over the phone at about 3 pm and it was ready within the 5 minutes it took me to get there. I asked for some extra mint yogurt and it was put into my bag with no extra charge.  I can only comment on the biryani seeing that it was my first time and it was delicious - even after the 20 minutes it took me to get to eating it. It came with some sort of a hot sauce which was really nice.  I will definitely return to try some of the kebabs."}
{"text":"The Chicken Boti or Butter Chicken w/ their Garlic Naan are must try dishes for anyone stopping by. Would have given 5 stars if it was only the food, but their service is average. Not bad, but nothing special.  Their coal oven adds a distinct taste, which I like, that I haven't had anywhere else. Anybody that's interested in or wanting to try Indian/Pakistani food need to come here."}
{"text":"When you walk through the doors it's very empty and spacious. Not clean.. We were sat upstairs in a booth which the cushions were broken and it felt like we were sinking into the bench and it hurt our bums.  The atmosphere was like being in a high school cafeteria. No music and tables and tables of people eatting.... The walls were covered in dirt and gum. Gordon Ramsay would not approve. Some people working there had plastic gloves on while you got served the food.. made me feel like I was in a hospital. The service was good and the food was average. I would not go back because of the atmosphere was not in one bit nice and it was very dusty and dirty! The place looks like it never gets cleaned."}
{"text":"Came here with my group and here is the Good and the Bad  Good:  Food tastes excellent. No complaints at all.  The meat platter is a must order  and is well worth the price  Naans are  excellent    Bad:  Long dine in times. :We had to wait almost 1 hour for our food to arrive. Too much rice in biryani.: If you glance at  any of the biryani plates there is an abundance of rice with a  small amount for meat.  The biryani would be worth its price if the rice is reduced by 25 % and the meat  increased by that amount.  Ambiance: The ambiance is very  simplistic and could use a lot of refurnishing .  Long service times: While the service is good , servers are polite, the speed is slow, and the restaurant can benefit from staffing more servers to assist customers needs.  Final Verdict: I will return but only for takeout .  I will dine in here if the overall ambiance and service times have improved based on future yelp reviews"}
{"text":"The establishment reminds me of a cheap restaurant from Pakistan. It is extremely dirty and flies everywhere. I am surprised how they passed inspection.   On a positive note food was good, but I won't be returning back just because of mere fact that the place is filthy."}
{"text":"Their lamb biriyani is really good. Thr qualty of basmati rice is good. The reshmi kabab is flavorful and comes with naan. Personally I would prefer to have some extra mirchi salan that comes with the biriyani. They give eay too little. At times Have received very few small chunks of meat, aftet complaining they ensured they added enough pieces next time I ordered. All in all this place satisfies my biriyani craving successfully. Though I always did take away, would certainly want to try the kabab sizzler: platter on premise. Will keep coming back for sure."}
