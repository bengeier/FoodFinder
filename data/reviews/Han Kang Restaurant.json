{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for Korean food! Service is fabulous, we are always greeted warmly by the staff.  I've been going here for years as they have the best stews!!  Some of my favorite dishes from here is their Yu Kae Jang (spicy beef stew), Kam Pung Kee (Crispy Chicken) and, Kam ja tang (pork bone soup).  This place is amazing!"}

{"text":"Was there for a late lunch (@2pm) after an eventful shopping trip with a friend. We actually stumbled in here by accident thinking it was the Japanese/Korean restaurant our friends had recommended (it wasn't!). For the most part it's in a run down strip plaza at the corner of Pharmacy/Sheppard. 

At entrance we were greeted promptly with a smile and seat in our private booths.  Our private booth had a sliding 'window' which connected to the adjacent booth. The washrooms were in the basement.  The restaurant didn't appear particularly big - I'm estimating 15-20 tables at most. We were quickly handed our menus and instructed to hit the 'ping pong'/order bell when we were ready. For the most part, we didn't really look any further than the lunch menu which offered a respectable variety of Korean and Japanese staples (teriyaki, bulgogi, sushi etc) at a reasonable price starting from $7.95.   As it was very quiet, the wait staff came promptly after we'd rung the bell. We ordered the Chicken teriyaki bento and the Tempura Bento.  We had the option of white or brown rice.  Fearing that the brown rice might be stiff, we both ordered the white.  

Our appetizer was sort of like an amuse bouche-ish affair: A strand of somen in a dashi/broth served in a small ceramic bowl. The texture was fine if not a little soggy for my liking. The miso soup came after and it was slightly over salted (not miso taste salted but more like table salt-salted?!?!). 

Our bentos came and the presentation was neat and pretty as expected from most Japanese/Korean establishments.  In each of the bento boxes, there were side dishes of salad with the typical wafu/Japanese vinaigrette dressing, some beansprouts, two fried fish paste(?)-pork (?)-carrot mini meat balls, and a small fried panko crusted maki (I think it was avocado... and something else in it) - the sauce  for the maki was good. It tasted fine for the most part although there was a lot of guessing as to what was in the sides (but I guess that's the fun of it! and I didn't mind)  The rice was at a decent temperature and was fluffy enough although I personally found it to be a little on the dryer side.  My tempura offerings included 2 shrimp and your usual mix of vegetables (sweet potato, cucumber etc).  Again it was at a nice temperature and rather crispy although I found the batter to be a little dense for my like liking; I prefer it to be lighter.  The dipping sauce was okay as well. The chicken teriyaki looked yummy and cooked well and it tasted decent.  For the most part we were pretty hungry and it hit the spot. Portion sizes were acceptable.

Overall, everything was OK for a lack of a better word. Don't know if I'd necessarily come back to this restaurant but it was a satisfactory experience for the most part."}

{"text":"A nice cozy little restaurant run by Korean's which offer both Japanese and Korean dishes. What I like about this place is that it opens late so even on a week day I was able to come at 9pm and still order one of my favorite Korean dishes (Pork Bone Soup). I have tried many pork bone soups and most places serve it with the soup looking like lava in color and I find these to be overly salty. The one served up here though is more of a tanned color. The soup was filled with flavor and was not even near the saltiness level of other places. It was also filled with tons of fall-off the bone meat. If I starred at the meat hard enough I'm sure it would have fell off the bone. Side dishes were also great (broccoli, bean sprouts, glass noodle, kimchii, cucumbers, radish and a mini bowl of noodles in soup). I've never had a mini noodle soup as a side dish but the soup was really flavorful.

Pleasantly surprised with the meal

{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Wednesday and I wish the experience was a little better. We ordered a sushi lunch and a tempura lunch. The sushi lunch served was rather horrid as the fish did not look fresh and the cut was wrong, especially the salmon. Boyfriend said he's scared to finish it, I wouldn't disagree. The tempura lunch I had didn't fare any better. The batter was not crispy and dense, not to mention it was extremely oily. The japchae that came with it was just as bad. It was all clumped together and had no taste to it. I will not recommend this place to anyone, especially when there's 3 other places around this area."}
{"text":"Great service, great food and great prices.  Whether it's Japanese or Korean you're seeking, you won't leave disappointed.  There is a good variety of panchan offered to any main entree and they will readily fill you up before the rest of the food hits the table!

Start with the japchae, translucent Korean-style noodles with vegetables; the sun dubu jegae is well worth it and is easily made vegetarian if you request it.  The tea, roasted with rice, is a good compliment to the food as well.  Dessert often consists of fresh orange slices.

As in South Korea, there is a little 'doorbell' attached to each table used to fetch the waiter or waitress. I've never see this restaurant crowded. I doubt it could handle the volume, since there are currently only one or two waiters/waitresses working on a given day. Han Kang remains a hidden gem in Scarborough."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever. And its quite good. It has a really cute Korean traditional dining kind of feel to it. I love how there are bells which you can ring for the servers. The location seems relatively sketchy though, in a run-down little plaza. 

The food is relatively decently priced. You can expect to spend around $10-15 per person for dinner. Their appetizers that are served with meals are really delicious. And as far as I know, they don't charge extra for additional appetizers. 

The food is also very authentic and I heard about the place from my Korean friend's mom. I would definitely recommend people to try the Korean dishes as opposed to the sushi, because the sushi is average but the Korean food is very delicious."}
{"text":"This restaurant is called Han River on the signs but the receipt that show it is also call Han Kang.. 

I was there for lunch..and the place was busy with just 2 waitstaffs and 1 sushi chef working, so the service was quite slow.

Han River served both Japanese and Korean food that are runned and owned by Korean. 

Lunch special starts at $7.95 to $12.95 which are combination of Teriyaki dishes, Sushi and Roll. Sashimi and Korean dishes. There are 14 different choices.

I ordered the Han River Bento which has Sashimi and Tempura. All lunches comes with miso soup, salad and appetitizer. 

The miso soup is so salty! I just cannot drink it. The appetitizer is alright with transparent noodles and a fried fish cake (I think it is a fish cake?)  

There are 12 pieces of Sashimi which are fresh and tasty. Same with the Tempura. I have to give them extra marks for their brown rice. This is a mixture of brown rice, red cargo rice and beans. They put extra water when cooking it so it is nice and chewy.. remind me of sticky rice. (You have a choice of either white or brown rice with no extra charges, thanks for the nice waitress for asking when I ordered)

I think I will be back at dinner time or order a dish from the regular/Korean menu to see what kind of side dishes they offer. Sometimes I am so full just eating the side dishes.. :)

There are little private rooms if you do desire some privacy.

They accepts AMEX, Mastercard and Visa."}
