{"text":"I ate here sometime in March/April this year while taking classes at the university. I ordered the Turkey Panini. Honestly the panini had hardly any toppings on it.  I think the flavor ideas of this place are great but the sandwiches are seriously overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"The lemonade was good. The panini cost $7.50, took 20 minutes (there were all of 4 people ahead of us), and tasted flavorless and dull, a little like what I would expect licking a dusty shelf would taste like. Never again."}
{"text":"It's not often that you come across a food cart with such a diverse and flexible menu. Toast offers great variety and always-changing daily specials, and even gives you the option to make your own panini from the ingredients they have available! Additionally, it's very rare for food carts to have such an open window through which you can see basically everything that happens in the cart-- no feelings of \"what the heck are they putting in my sandwich\" at this place.  There aren't many negative aspects to Toast, but I'm not always so impressed with the flavor of their sandwiches. The portions are filling, wholesome, and generous (and I'm in love with the bread!), but the ingredients taste similar to what you'd find at a fast food place. Overall, though, it's a fantastic food cart!"}
{"text":"Well I really wanted to like Toast and to write a good review, but it was hard too.  I like the place, the atmosphere, the menu and a lot about it.  But, after 7 months in business things do not run smoothly.  It seemed like Joy behind the bar was the only person with any restaurant experience.  The \"manager\" women was pretty clueless and we witnessed several people getting their own silverware or hunting down their waitress for their checks.  Very inconsistent service, long times between service for drinks or food. etc.  The food was good, although I would say pricey for the portion sizes.  $15 for a gormet burger.   Hire a real manager and whip the place into shape, or it will be dying a slow word of mouth death...."}
{"text":"Wine selection is by far the best on the west side.  The charcuterie board is phenomenal as well.  A bit pricey to say the least.  What ruined the experience is the clientele...  a loud,rude bunch of snobbish, hipster regulars who hogged the bar and as you could tell the bartender payed no mind to any new guests coming and going. I give service and clientele a D+"}
{"text":"Such a romantic and beautiful setting! Split an appetizer and dessert but after looking at the menu I'm not sure I'd go back for dinner - limited menu. Definitely a great date night stop or great stop for a girls night out!  Wish I would've noticed the patio earlier."}
{"text":"This is a sad tale of a very disappointing, mushy, tasteless, lukewarm bean burger.   I have wanted to try toast for two years but just never got around to it. Finally, on a whim, we went in during happy hour for an early dinner and drinks. I got the burbon cider (delicious). First demerit, there are very few vegetarian options. That doesn't shock me; a lot of Cleveland  restaurants have yet to evolve in this respect. We ordered the rice and bean burgers and the cheese plate. The cheese plate was nothing to write home about (although nothing can be as good as urban farmer), save for the worst Camembert cheese I've ever had the misfortune to meet. The burger was, without a doubt, the worst veggie burger I've ever had. Possibly some of the worst food I've ever had. It was mushy, watery, lukewarm, and tasteless. It's clear that someone just cooked beans and rice, lazily threw it into a food processor without adding spices, formed it into a paddy and that was it. The bun was one of those dry generic sesame seed buns. They tried to add flavor by adding pickled red onions but that did nothing. For all of the great things I've heard about toast this made me so sad. I know Toast has great, innovative chefs and to serve this food was just lazy in my opinion.   I'm usually willing to give restaurants a second chance but I'm on the fence about this one."}
{"text":"Loved the brunch. Great french press coffee, and everything we ordered was fantastic. The side of sausage was my favorite. All food is local, and the staff was laid back and friendly.   We would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Gili, the owner of the cart, wrote me and clarified a couple of issues. I love how Yelp provides a channel for concerns to be voiced to the owner, and together we hope we can make the experience better for others!   I learnt from Gili himself that all of the food in the display case is in the refrigerator and is kept at the proper temperature, that makes me feel a lot at ease about the ingredients. It is also great that their open-concept cart lets customers see how their  food is prepared, since most typical food carts have small windows and you cannot watch the food preparation. So this is a great distinction from other food carts. That said it's almost impossible to stop flying insects completely. I am fine with that as long as they don't get onto the ingredients or onto the food.   Now that I feel a lot more comfortable I am looking forward to going back to try their paninis again."}
{"text":"Pro's: Fresh ingredients offered in inventive combinations from a rotating menu--in small tasty amounts. In a converted building (former house?), smartly adapted into a street-level lounge area and a cozy upper level bar and tables. Friendly and attentive service.  Not-so-Pro's: I love tapas and small plate menus; here your bill can quickly tally up to a sizable chunka change for truly small (tasty) amounts. And those fresh ingredients in entree items are tastiest when served at proper temps--two entrees our table ordered were just barely above warm."}
{"text":"I have had consecutive really great trips to Toast. It was well worth to hurry out of work on a Friday night to make it in during happy hour since they have pretty major discounts off their wine. The wine list has something for everyone, and after an excessive use of Vivino, I can say that their selection is not only unique but very fairly priced. You are getting a really unique bottle when you order something there. I really liked the jazz odyssey white blend that we shared, and I know it's not something I would have been able to find in a store.   As for the food, we had some finger food that was fun and tasty. Lots of good apps for sharing. I would always recommend Toast as the best option in the neighborhood to come meet a few friends before a movie or to start your night. We had really great service each time and everyone who works in there is really knowledgeable about the entire menu. I am looking forward to picking up my favorite pastime of weekend afternoon happy hours on their back patio when it gets warmer!"}
{"text":"The outdoor patio is great and quaint but the food is just okay. We had the ramp pasta and it was under cooked and under seasoned.  We had to return it.  The fish dish that we got was good, but their cheese plate was uninspired and just okay. Some of the cheeses that they featured tasted like cardboard."}
{"text":"A bit precious for our taste.   Special occasion event started with  fried pickles which were a bunch greasy having absorbed enough oil to obliterate beyond recognition the actual vegetables used.   Two glasses of ordinary red wine , and one flat ginger beer for  beverages.  Four entrees , the two meat dishes were fine though at above twenty dollars per did not delivery portion value , come on really half a dozen tiny Brussels sprouts to go with some ordinary mashed potatoes  ( no explanation why the purple potatoes did not appear).  The two vegan dishes , were indelible by any standards , and outside of a piece of local apple impossible to identify by ingredient. Save some odd sort of either stick or branch that my wife kept feeder me with a disturbed yet quizzical look on her less than amused face.  Upside, nice atmosphere , friendly service , and a civil decimal level .  Left hungry after laying out over one hundred twenty dollars , and wonder just what small and large plate dining is all about as all four of us ripped into a variety of snacks after dinner to fill the void from leaving toast hungry.  Funny , for a restaurant named toast , not a civil piece of bread available for the. Purpose."}
{"text":"Babe and I ate paninis from Toast yesterday and I don't believe I've ever had a better one. Babe had a veggie one which she said was very good. I got the omelet one from their specials menu and will, with zero thought, get the same one every time I'm on the mall -- it was that good. The panini was lightly toasted, the omelet was firm, there was plenty of ham, and the cheese, tomatoes etc were very flavorful. Get a little cup of sriracha/mayo along with whatever you're eating -- super stuff."}
{"text":"The breakfast food is excellent. Entire family went and everybody was very satisfied. Breakfast sausage and bacon were exceptional. Service was a little slow. We were surprised that hipstery place didn't have accommodations for food allergies - no almond milk for coffee or gluten free toast. Would definitely go back but would love to see some allergy friendly items in the future."}
{"text":"Liked the atmosphere and the local food concept.  Unfortunately, the portions are not worth the price, especially the large plates.  Ordered a stuffed pepper (barley and carrots) for $15 and only received a half of pepper.  Left hungry and went to another local establishment for drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Wow we Had a great experience stoping at the bar.  The bartender was very knowledgeable and very friendly. We enjoyed the variety of drinks. I will certainly return for the food \"he menu looks great \"!"}
{"text":"I booked the Toast truck for catering during the filming of my short film in Middleton and had such a great experience. The booking went smoothly and they worked with me on my timeline, budget, etc. Everyone enjoyed the meat and vegetarian options and the lemonade was a nice bonus. We were filming outside in 35 degree weather, so it was great to have a warm, easy to eat option for the film crew (they even offered me hot chocolate since I was freezing!) Definitely recommend for catering or for lunch on the go!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Very cool atmosphere, very quaint and cozy with a rustic vibe. I'm partial to patios and theirs is magical with string lights, a garden-esque feel, and just the right amount of space without feeling packed in. The people sitting next to us had their pups with them, so also furbaby friendly! Their drinks pack a punch and you can't go wrong with ordering numerous small plates to split. Our server was also very personable and great at offering suggestions. This place is truly a hidden gem, can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"A very attractive interior and their own garden promise a great dining experience but the menu is very limited and quite pricey. For what it is. We stuck with more moderate entrees. The burger is not made of beef but brisket and dry. The venison stew was gamey, as expected. There was a vegetarian selection and then quite pricey options we opted out of. The beet salad and cottage fries were great but $5 for bread seems high. Nothing we ate was worthy of reordering. I'd go for drinks and an appetizer but not to dine."}
{"text":"I ordered the Turkey. The guys in the cart were very friendly, and the veggies on top were fresh and plentiful, but it was still lacking any pizzaz.  Also the bun was bleh, kinda like eating cardboard, they needed more mayo or something on the bun for my tastes. The onions were chopped and kept falling off my sandwich, slices would have been easier to eat.   There wasn't much cheese, I should have ordered chedder instead of provolone since it was hard to taste it, and chedder has a bolder flavor.  All in all I wasn't really impressed with my $7.50 sandwich, I think I could find something I like better for the same price."}
{"text":"I have walked right by this place on my way down to the marina's countless times,  finally stopped and am very glad that I did!   I had a glass of Riesling to start (had no heard of the brand, but delicious), and the fried pickles (cauliflower, zucchini, yellow squash, pea pods) the batter that they were in was wonderful, as was the dill sauce.  (5$) followed that by the zucchini soup (gazpacho style, 6$ I think)  I was a bit nervous, but I just had to try.  The soup was incredible, very light.  I placed a take out order for their chicken salad sandwich, cherries, sharp cheddar, and peas on rye bread (again, a wonderful menu item!) (not sure on $).   While talking to the bartenders, I found out that they have a large garden at their disposal in the area.  They grow their veggies etc, they have hens as well that will be producing their eggs.  Everything they serve, with few exceptions (citrus, liquors, a few spices) comes from within the state.  Additionally, the chefs in the kitchen (2) create the menu, prepare, plate, and serve every menu item that  is enjoyed.  So every order is created with pride.    My only downside that I can find is that they didn't open closer to my house!  I'm glad that I stopped in!"}
{"text":"3.5 decent enough place, but pretty average. everything tasted okay, but felt overpriced for the portions/quality. cocktails were light and too sweet. might come back for brunch or to see their patio."}
{"text":"Went here with the family for mother's day brunch and was pretty disappointed overall. There are no highchairs at all, only boosters with no straps. So we had to stuff our stroller into the tight space to allow our 1 yr old to sit. Our waiter seemed to be a poor listener. He forgot to order my son's drink, and then we asked for the burger's toppings to be on the side but nothing came on the side and the burger had cheese on it and was well under cooked. I ordered the $16 salmon platter which came with 4 thin slices of smoked salmon, a bagel, some cream cheese, and a small assortment of pickled items. This was a pretty poor value for the money, albeit flavorful. My wife's gravy fries were good though. And the wine list is terrific .  Overall not impressed and likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Have not had dinner here. Drinks and appetizers were good but pricey. I love the local/natural/organic approach to the food. It does I deed taste great. But, you do pay the price. Three drinks each and 2 appetizers = One Benjamin for Two."}
{"text":"I look forward to coming back here. The relaxing, cozy vibe and the extremely friendly staff gave me a warm and fuzzy feel. I can see my boyfriend, some friends and I spending a Friday night getting toasty with their awesome selection of wine and spirits. The prices here are pretty reasonable and comparable to other bars similar. Definitely worth a stop if your in the area. I hear the food is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"I finally made it back again...and this time for tapas and drinks during happy hour before catching a movie at Capitol. It was such a better experience this time around. We sat at the bar and greeted by the bartender who was very attentive and friendly. I ordered a glass of wine ($2 off) and boyfriend ordered a beer ($1 off), we also ordered two appetizers: pickled deviled eggs ($3 for 2) and french fries (I think the fries are only on hh menu- $5).  The food was delicious! We devoured the fries, perfectly seasoned. The eggs also delicious, my only complaint is that 2 for $3 seems a little pricey for deviled eggs.  We'll definitely be back again! Hopefully to try dinner again next time."}
{"text":"My favorite part about toast is that they have a large selection of meats, cheeses, sauces, toppings, etc.  However, they don't seem to put enough of the toppings on there, which is sad. I generally order a pastrami + roast beef sandwich, and I like the flavor of the meats.  I also get garlic mayo, pesto, and all the toppings.  They're really nice to warn me that the peppers are really spicy (I have a high spice tolerance so I don't mind haha).  The service is good, but agreeing with other yelpers, the sandwiches are overpriced ..."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a Sunday for brunch (around 12:30pm).  It was not very busy, at all.  The weather was great so everyone was on the patio, which is really lovely and bigger than you would think just by looking at the building.  Our service was prompt and courteous.  He ordered a Bourbon drjnk and really enjoyed it.  I ordered a Bloody Mary and it was pretty good.  It was spicy and pretty thin (I like a chunky bloody mary...bring on the horseradish!), but I enjoyed it.  He ordered the Gravy Fries with Sausage Gravy and he LOVED his meal.  I considered getting the Gravy Fries with mushroom gravy, but instead I ordered the Country Fried Seitan which was DELICIOUS.  The seitan was battered and fried and super delicious.  It came w fried eggs (yum), mushroom gravy (yum), collard greens (yum), and the seasonal jam which happened to be blackberry (yum).  I have nothing bad to say and would highly recommend this spot, especially for brunch, since it can be really hard to find a place to brunch without an hour wait.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I had high expectations for this place. I go into every dining experience with an open mind.   My boyfriend and I joined an admittedly large group of friends for dinner. We were seated at a large picnic-style table in the noisy front room of the restaurant. The service was a bit slow to start, but we did have drinks in front of us before too long. The beer selection was nice, and after scoping out the very creative and expensive craft cocktail menu, we did opt for beer in order to save our purse for food instead.   The food and drink are on a New York price point, but the chef's tasting menu seemed like a reasonable deal in lieu of the $31 chicken roulade entree on its own. The tasting menu included three choices for $40 ($35 plus a $5 upcharge for a chicken dish). Because we were growing quite hangry, I selected the bread and flavored butters as my first item and requested that they bring it out ASAP. Another friend next to me requested the same.   When the bread arrived--- four small pieces in each order--- the food runner came to the opposite end of the table and announced that he would leave one basket at that end and the other closer to us. The thing is, Toast doesn't serve toast when you sit down. The bread was tasty, and it was part of my meal. I felt quite awkward having to yell across a table of ten hungry people that the bread was mine and that my boyfriend and I would be eating it. Don't their servers know that they don't drop free bread for their guests? They should.   My chicken arrived in a reasonable amount of time. It was described as a chicken roulade with cranberry stuffing, parsnip purée, confit potato, and gravy. The presentation was fantastic, but from the first bite, I was disappointed. Keeping in mind that this was a $31 entree when served alone, I was expecting more taste and more food! The spoonful of parsnip purée was hardly enough to accompany the chicken. The bland \"confit potato\" was inexplicably flavorless. I've had better French fries at Wendy's, and their fries suck! The \"gravy\" was served at room temperature in a ramekin the size of two thimbles (again, hardly enough to dress a stuffed and rolled chicken breast). And the chicken itself had no outwardly identifiable flavors. I had hoped for a cranberry stuffing that was bursting with flavor. Instead, it tasted just like it looked: taupe.   Side note: the potato confit (read: French fries) was garnished with sprigs of thyme and then covered in what appeared to be a bunch garlic skins. Not to sound too traditional, but I tend to throw that part away after I crush my garlic. Also, I cook better chicken.   My boyfriend ordered a brisket burger. The menu said it was served with goat Gouda, tomato jam, lettuce, and aioli with fries. The goat Gouda was undetectable. I'm not even sure it was actually there. The aioli must have ended up on someone else's plate, because it certainly wasn't on his. After a bite of his sandwich, he said \"Yep. It's a burger.\" Disappointing.   Another friend ordered a chef's flight like I did, but he included the suggested wine pairings for his three courses. At $53, this is not a bad deal at first glance. Unfortunately, the wine pairings didn't make it to the table. Before his final course arrived, he asked about his wine, and our waitress felt very bad. She said she would take the wine off the bill, and in the same breath she also asked him to remind her what his entree was. \"The brisket burger,\" he said tenderly, \"and no worries on the wine mixup.\" I suppose we all expected that dish to be served with some wine, considering she asked him specifically what he was eating. Did not happen.  Next time I'll try something else, somewhere else, with better service and more taste for less money. Our city might be an underdog compared to big cities like Chicago, but Clevelanders have discerning tastes. We have all eaten in fine restaurants, so we know what to expect when we spend our allowance on a good meal. And we also know when we've been fleeced."}

{"text":"ALL DAY Happy Hour on Wednesdays!!    Needless to say that I went on a Wednesday to check this out. I have eaten at Toast a couple of times before but have never been to their happy hour. I was impressed.   They have $2 off glasses of wine (including champagne) and food specials. I enjoyed the beer braised wings (you get 6 for $5). Other items enjoyed at my table were the burger (marked down to $9 during happy hour), a cheese board and the tomato flat bread."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have never been disappointed. The cocktails are delicious and the bartenders are super friendly. If you're stumped, just strike up a conversation and you'll have a delicious drink in front of you in no time.   The food that I've had has also been delicious (I was even convinced to try rabbit for the first time. Rabbit is not even close to my favorite thing to eat, but I'm glad I gave it a chance.) and the happy hour is quite the draw.   That said, this isn't a frequent stop. The prices are a bit high, but when I'm feeling fancy, adventurous, or in need of a happy hour treat, this is definitely on the list."}
{"text":"Had not been here in several years, but met-up with friends before a move across the street at the Capitol.  The Happy Hour drink specials were great with $4 beers and $6 cocktails.  My wife and I shared a bunch of appetizer type dishes, and all were really top notch!!!  The buffalo cauliflower was lightly crispy and had a hint of vinegar from the sauce, served with a chunky bleu cheese dressing giving you a \"traditional\" buffalo style dish.  The wings were big and meaty (whole, not pieces), served baked with a garlicky, salty rub on top.  My wife went gaga for these buggers.  The brisket beef burger was juicy and served on a nicely grilled bun and a thick slice of cheese...delicious.  The cottage fries were covered with salt and vinegar and came with homemade ketchup and mayo as dipping sauces.  I was not as impressed the last time I was here, but was very pleasantly surprised at the quality (and value) of the meal we had.  Will most certainly return, especially with the convenience right across the street from the theatre."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Cleveland! The food is amazing, the service is top notch, the bartenders have such great personality and really make eating there a pleasurable experience. The menu is constantly evolving and the brisket burger is to die for!"}
{"text":"We went here for Sunday brunch. Very welcoming neighborhood restaurant with reasonable prices, right across from Gordon Square public parking.   I enjoyed the food, once it arrived, but I felt the wait was way too long for eggs and toast. Gourmet or not. Also, our waiter was not very attentive: one 10oz glass of water the entire 2 hours we were there, and one 8oz coffee refill. My SO asked for jam which never came, and to top it off we waited 15 mins to process the check.  They have a beautiful extensive full bar, but we didn't utilize that. Might try them again for happy hour, but honestly the poor service was a big turn off.  TL;DR: +Good food +charming atmosphere and décor  -1 star for brunch meal delay -1 star for poor service"}
{"text":"I look forward to my paninis every summer that I come home to Madison! My favorite is their homemade pesto & red bell pepper mayo...they add great flavors to the paninis! They have delicious, soft, fresh bread and I love that they have the option to build my own since I prefer to customize what I'd like on in. Usually I load my panini with cheese and veggies and go the vegetarian route, although my big meat eater friends love combining different meats and switching it up all the time. They have a great variety of recommended menu items to choose from as well! I love this food cart and would definitely recommend it to any food lover!"}
{"text":"Always great service.  The sandwiches are pretty delicious but more often than not almost taste the same.  Favorite sandwich - Turkey pesto panini and the Veg grilled Cheese Lesser known fact- They serve a mean Pineapple Lemonade! Truly refreshing for a hot day. Its a great place to get a panini on the run!"}
{"text":"The casual chic ambiance... The cocktails... The wine selection... The bartendress. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Update: went back because I love this place and apparently my concerns were shared by others because both were addressed which were portion size and service.  The improvements earned Toast a 5."}
{"text":"Loved the food, atmosphere, and service here. Will definitely be back! We had the apple salad, house fries and wings, all of which were delicious. For dessert we had the pumpkin fritters and French pressed coffee--so good!"}
{"text":"I have mostly visited Toast in the after dinner hours looking to find a good place to settle in with some friends over cocktails and some snacks. I've enjoyed the meat and cheese boards as well as the pickles. The service was excellent. On one recent occasion they were able to accommodate our growing table so that all had a great time."}
{"text":"Toast does a stellar job at keeping local food interesting, inventive, and delicious. Their menu changes frequently, keeping aligned with whatever is freshly available given the time of year. My husband and I have been to Toast too many times to count, but find their appetizers, house-made charcuterie, and burgers to all be stand-outs. Start with their 'trio of toasts', which changes almost daily, as an opening bite while deciding what to order next. Then make your way to the very shareable mushroom crepe, or rabbit nuggets, or even perhaps a brandade pierogie. Toast cooks the food I love to eat: elegant in it's simplicity but absolutely focused on flavor and harmony.  While their food is certainly in the spotlight the wine selections are also fantastic. Their bottle selection changes often, and has a wide range to suite any palette. My husband and I are partial to Turley wines, and they've actually had some in recently, which is very rare! Toast skips the standard wine offerings and encourages patrons to sip new libations, and find a favorite.  The staff are welcoming and helpful, and knowledgeable about wine. It's obvious that they all share the same philosophy when it comes to appreciating high quality local food and diverse wines, their passion for it is evident.  They also happen to make fantastic cocktails, if you're not in the mood for wine. (but who's not in the mood for wine?!?)"}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high of this place - but it did remind me a lot of Spice down the street:  good concept, but execution isn't there.  The food is only OK and it's expensive.  I won't be going here again, there are way too many good restaurants in Cleveland to give this place a second chance.  We had the buffalo cauliflower and a reuben that I thought were both subpar. If you haven't mastered these...shucks."}
{"text":"From 4 stars to 2.5 I had a good experience at Toast back in June, my boyfriend and I went for my birthday, we sat outside and they have a terrific patio, service and food were good, nothing exceptional. This past weekend I went back with some friends, we sat at the bar ordered drinks, I decided to order some fries and and they still hadn't arrive after 25 minutes (I was watching the clock because we had tickets to a show), I asked the server about the order and if I could cancel it because we had to go and we'd been waiting a while, the server literally ROLLED HER EYES and said she would check, she made no effort to disguise her annoyance with my request. I'm pretty sure she forgot to put the order in. Anyway, I got the fries to go since it was such a huge deal, she put them in a box and threw away the sauce without asking if I wanted it. I'm sure the other bartenders and servers are probably more personable, but this interaction left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I think this place is excellent. Everything is super fresh, well executed, tasty and reasonably priced. You can see right in to their nice, clean and organized kitchen. The service is very prompt and knowledgeable. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great Panini.  A friend and I do laps around the square and stopped by for lunch on Tuesday.  Two bread choices...then choose your toppings...meats and cheese.  The salty goodness of green olives appealed to me but I wasn't sure it would really work with my sandwich choice.  I was assured it would.  The Panini was done pretty quickly and was really good.  The lemonade was refreshing.  They are very flexible with the ingredient combinations.  It would be nice if they featured a sandwich of the day for when you want to try something different.  Oh, and they take credit cards which always helps.  I would go there again."}
{"text":"Went here for a Sunday brunch with my ladies.  This place was very hit and miss for us.  Hit:We got to sit at a cool booth/couch table at the large front window. Miss: There was only one sever for the entire restaurant.  Yes, he was good at his job, but no one is good enough to take care of a whole place by themself in a timely fashion. Hit: Grapefruit mimosas were delicious. Miss: Getting the carafe of mimosas (gets you 2 partially filled glasses worth) is not a better deal than buying a single glass since they way overfill a wine glass the mimosa comes in. Hit: The chorizo gravy fries and the pumpkin fritters were both totally amazing. Miss: The breakfast bowl is $14 for separate piles of fruits, veggies and rice. Not worth it."}
{"text":"I'll admit, I have been scoping out Toast from afar for a long time. Walking by the building with the \"coming soon\" sign in the window for years. Then they finally opened, and I didn't hear too much buzz, so I didn't race to check it out. I figured I'd let them sort out their first few weeks and stop by eventually.  Well last night, after seeing a movie at Capital Theatre, I turned to my man and said \"Let's go down to Toast and make fun of them\", mostly because that is our favorite pasttime, being haters at restaurants. (But please understand, we are perfectly well behaved patrons)  I was completely SHOCKED. Atmosphere was great, staff was friendly and talkative, menu appeared spot on, music was perfect choice and volume. Everything fell in to place. I had been drinking beer prior to arrival, and wanted something a little more sophisticated. The drink menu was wonderfully built, with traditional items at the top, stating Manhattan's, Old Fashioned, etc were available everyday. Followed by Something Old and Something New-ish sections, with a nice variety of cocktails. The selection of liquor convinced me anything would be awesome.  I asked the bartender if I could get a vodka gimlet, to which he replied \"Of course!\", and went to work with enthusiasm. Man-friend opted for the JAFB Cream Ale, which hails from Wooster. I sampled some, and was pleasantly surprised.   Overall, a great experience. I can't wait to go back and eat a full meal. Based on the size of the place, I'll probably opt for a weekday or reservations, I can imagine it gets crowded."}
{"text":"Toast offers a quaint relaxing atmosphere. I like the fact it is in a house and I really liked the ambiance. Had a few appetizers all of which I enjoyed. Toast has a very nice wine list.  Toast uses fresh ingredients they get from local vendors which is always a good thing. It is a good place to go with a date or a few special friends on a night out."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming one of my favorite places. Small and cozy, it is a nice reprieve from some of the bigger spots around town. They have an excellent selection of wine and craft cocktails. I recently checked out their adorable patio. What a perfect way to spend a lazy afternoon or a romantic evening.  And the food...what unique and delicious creations! They have Saturday Brunch. BTW, why don't more restaurants do brunch on Saturday instead of Sunday?? Anyway, the duck and waffles...oh my! Savory and moist duck confit on top of buttery and maple doused waffles. Nice way to one-up the chicken and waffle craze, Toast! The Baba Burger was also amazing if you are a vegetarian (or a wanna be veg head as I try to be...dang that duck messing up my moral code!) The Anna Rita was also nothing short of spectacular.  Carrot juice, OJ, Tequila, and something else,  magic maybe? I will figure it out next time, and at this rate, it may be tomorrow."}
{"text":"Decent food. Interesting atmosphere. Overpriced for what you get... You could conceivably spend $40 and leave hungry."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner with friends. It was our first time at Toast. The small plates were great to share. The server was off a little. She seemed to make a lot of things up when we asked about the menu items."}
{"text":"A cute little romantic/hipster/wahteveryouneedittobe joint near Gordon square was our destination last night. Seat yourself deal. I really just wanted to find a place with good fries- and this place did not disappoint. Their salt and vinegar fries were amazing chunks of potato medallions- fresh and yummy! I wanted to try both the fish and crispy lentil cake so my partner got the fish and i got the lentil cake. The fish was cooked wonderfully- had a nicer earthy mellow flavor of sunchockes and pepita. I got the lentil cake- i think it was a good thought but poorly executed. It tasted burnt and the inside was really mushu. It was accompanied by a side of carrots that were seasoned and grilled- they tasted okay but the best part of the meal. I barely touched my lentil cake and sent it back almost whole. I also got the Jockey Full Of Bourbon which was great! By far my favorite part of the meal :) Dessert: well, they were out of 2/3 desserts. So, we got the only thing they had on their menu : Assorted Petit Fours. There were three very tiny pieces of some sort of vanilla buttercream cake, chocolate chip cookie dough truffle ball and dark chocolate nut truffle ball. We didnt enjoy any of them The dark chocolate ball was really hard, so we had to cut it with a knife. The vanilla cake was kinda bland but okay. Pricey: Fries, 2 entrees,2 drinks 1 dessert = 86$   Id come back maybe to try another dish, for the ambiance and drinks. Service was pretty good. I genuinely believe I just had crappy luck that day with food since my friend enjoyed his meal. So, I'm willing to do toast round 2 soon :)  good for : date night , serious discussions, day away from the husband and dog, girls night out, meet the parents."}
{"text":"Rustic, yet modern atmosphere with good drinks and diverse and healthy food options.  Sat at a table at the front window and was perfect for a private conversation.  Service was prompt but not intrusive."}
{"text":"one of my favorite neighborhood haunts! the cocktails are on-point, servers offer great conversations & the happy hour is one of the best in CLE but ends at 6:30 pm so you have been warned. PS: the brunch is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Go for happy hour, get the cottage fries and an inventive cocktail... live happy. Sometimes if the cocktail that is featured doesn't fit my mood I ask them to make something up in a different direction and am always pleased. Or can't go wrong with champagne. Outdoor space is great. Ask about the toast of the day you get a sampler of 3. Usually the one I am most afraid of is the most delicious. They made me really enjoy beets that says a lot."}
{"text":"These guys were great! Just started out and put on one of the best food trucks at Madison's A la Cart food fest this past weekend. Super nice people, great food, and gave generous portions. Also one of  the last ones open at the event.   Great start, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the salt and vinegar cottage fries are drool worthy. They have a pretty good selection of drinks, but it's a little pricey. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the music the crowd was nice. Not too crowded, it seemed really homey.  The service wasn't very good--inattentive, forgetful, not particular interested in doing their job. But alas, I enjoyed my self.   If the service was better, or maybe sitting at the bar as opposed to a table, I would definitely make more trips to Toast."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE food truck! I love it when they come to my work parking lot, because I always have to fight the urge to go back down and grab another panini. The turkey panini is my favorite, although they are all delicious. Definitely be sure to try their homemade garlic aioli- what a yummy treat!"}
{"text":"I love Toast-- there is something about it that is so charming that immediately draws you in. They have one of the cutest patios in CLE & I always enjoy the food. Quaint, casual little joint with fresh and delicious food options. I'm obsessed wit their cottage fries and usually like any food I try, but the pork chop was eh. Good beer and drink options."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! I LOVE this place! This place has got to be my favorite bar ever! The bartenders are such artist! And the kitchen...Bravo! You guys have worked your way into my heart through every experience I've had there. Gosh that Brisket and the Fries....mmmm but I really need bottles and bottles of that tomato jam! I also want to mention that the kitchen comes out to check on the tables pretty often! Can't wait to get back in again!"}
{"text":"What can I say, the bread is amazing! We had drinks and a couple appetizers. One being the mixed toast. It was a hearty farm bread with various toppings. Really flavorful. They didn't just grab some \"gourmet\" ingredients and toss them on, it was a well executed dish. The layers of flavor and texture really worked for each topping."}
{"text":"Gili's Paninis are FANTASTIC!  Made to order as good as it gets!  In addition to having a ton of flavor, mine was hot and fresh!  Gili is super friendly too!  You can really taste the quality he puts into his work."}
{"text":"Great experience!!came by last week for lunch,all the ingredients are extremely fresh,friendly service and the panini was delicious. Give it a try...you won't regret that!"}
{"text":"I am with Lilly in her assessment of Toast.   My GF and I were excited to try this dining establishment from their online menu and Doug Trattner's  Scene review.   There was no host (on a Saturday night) so I had to inquire about seating.  We opted for a table in the back room.  The dining room's bare walls seemed to intensify the lively discussion a the next table so much that we had to talk (shout) above normal conversation levels.   After a long wait we were greeted and immediately placed our drink orders.  From there, things got worse.  We did not see our server for at least 20 minutes after our drinks were served --- AND finished.   I've worked in the food industry for years and this is unacceptable, even in the first few weeks of opening...  Things should be running like clockwork before the doors are open.    I even had to ask the burly, lumber-jack of a busboy (busman)for the day's fish selection. Eventually our timid server reappeared after many attempts at eye contact.  We placed our orders ( kale salad, rabbit fettuccine, warm asparagus salad and the fish du jour.   ** the Food came and there was NO cutlery on the table**  We had to ask.   All of the food was extremely tasty.  The noodles seemed house made or from Ohio City Pasta.  My fish was cooked perfectly with crispy skin.   The wine selection is eclectic and well priced.     Here's my review in a nutshell: Pro-  Great food featuring local suppliers, interesting menu, great small plates, good wine list.  Con-  Overly noisy in the dining room,  horrible service (the front of the house staff seemed to wander aimlessly),  dining tables a bit too rustic ( for a $100 check ,  I don't want to eat on lumber.)  Overall, the food did not make up for the poor service.  IF and it's a big IF ... I ever go back, I'd sit at the bar, order a glass of wine with a few tapas.  I probably will not recommend this place...  There are plenty of creative dining establishments in the area."}
{"text":"Pretentious and over rated. Our server was condescending. The charcuterie board had something unidentifiable that looked like nothing more than shaved fat."}
{"text":"The main course and the appetizers were solid. The cocktails were also strong. Two things were a miss though.  First, the flourless chocolate cake was super dry and just too rich and sweet. The second problem was the coffee. How is it in this day and age a quality restaurant uses something as wasteful as pods? The Nescafe pods should be banned. They're wasteful, the coffee is mediocre and you can't get a refill with burning through another pod. I'll definitely go back to Toast. But hope they'll serve some locally roasted strong  brew."}
{"text":"went to toast for brunch a few weeks ago and was sorely disappointed. while the food was delicious and the restaurant itself was quaint, our server seemed burdened and annoyed by our very presence. we were rushed, ignored, and generally mistreated in a way that ensures we won't be returning.   we walked into a fairly empty restaurant, 2 of us to start, and mentioned that we would be between 3 and 5 people in total. our server rolled her eyes and asked if it would be 3 or 5. we reiterated that we weren't sure but wanted to sit somewhere big enough for 5. rather than accommodate us, we were sat at a table for 2 and were moved to a larger table once other friends started showing up.   every item we ordered/request we made was met with an eyeroll or expression of contempt from our server. i ordered an item they'd run out of and was told \"you can't have that, it's out.\" server didn't make any alternative suggestions. one member of our party arrived right as brunch ended, and was told with a great deal of attitude that their food options would be limited since they \"came too late.\" again, they weren't busy, so i don't know if she was having a bad day or just hates her job, but we were treated so poorly that most of the afternoon was spent trying to laugh off and forget about our awful brunch experience.   i'm not one to complain to management since i've worked in the industry and know everyone has their bad days--however, i wish i had mentioned something before leaving. definitely won't return. there are too many great brunch places in Cleveland to settle for subpar service and feeling unwelcome."}
{"text":"Dropped by for brunch and was a bit disappointed by the food. Went on a Saturday morning, the toast was a little dry, eggs overdone and not runny. It almost tasted like it may have been sitting out for awhile. The good thing about this place is parking on the street for free which was nice. There are also some metered spots nearby as well. Service was also good but unfortunately did not make up for the overcooked and dry eggs :("}
{"text":"I'm a little apprehensive to give this little Gordon Square area gem a \"five star\" rating only because I don't want the secret to get out and have this place be constantly packed (I'm selfish, I know).  Drinks: Awesome! They have tons of great wine selections by the glass or bottle and they make a great cocktail that a seasoned drinker would undoubtedly appreciate and savor. I would recommend the \"Jockey Full of Bourbon\".  Atmosphere: This is a wonderful spot for a dinner or even just drinks with work colleagues or a small group of close friends. I would not, however, recommend this place for a large gathering of people unless you reserve the entire restaurant... otherwise everyone else would just end up feeling like they are part of your event whether they wanted to be or not. The interior is well decorated and provides a relaxing and sophisticated (but not fancy) tone. They also have a great patio that carries out the vibe from the interior. I love sitting on patio with a friend, having a drink and casual conversation. You feel like you are at the patio of your friend's house who you love but has annoyingly better taste than you.   Service: Again, awesome! The staff is very knowledgeable of the menu and they seem to know exactly the perfect items to order for every guest that walks through their door.   Food: Good. I would probably give the food four stars for the price. Not to say the food is bad or even mediocre, I would just proceed with caution before ordering the most expensive item on the menu on your first visit.   Toast is a fabulous addition to Gordon Square and is officially on my list of \"go to\" places when I'm trying to show-off all the amazing things Cleveland has to offer."}
{"text":"I have driven through Gordon Square a few times before and have always wanted to stop and try one of the restaurants. After reading some reviews on Yelp, we decided to try Toast and I'm so glad we did. It is located in what was formerly a house so you instantly feel at-home when you walk in the door. We went around Christmastime and they had a giant Christmas tree in the foyer. Behind the bar, they have wine bottles that are cemented into the wall. It's the little details such as this that make this place stand out. They write the trio of toasts of the day on a chalkboard that sits on each table. The toasts on that particular day were mozzarella and grape tomatoes, manchego and fig jam and a rabbit hanky-panky. Each of them were very different in flavor, but all were great! We then split the squash ravioli with hazlenuts in a sage brown butter sauce. It was light, it was creamy, it was flavorful, it was delicious! They offer a good selection of wines and the wait-staff are all very helpful and knowledgeable about the different options. Toast promotes that they serve food from local farmers or from their own small urban farm. I love the fact that so many restaurants in the Cleveland area support local farms!"}
{"text":"Well, we came back on a weeknight this time and as I suspected, the food really does win the show. (And they hired a hostess!!)   We sat at the bar this time around and were taken care of right away, since it wasn't busy. I ordered the hot mulled cider and my boyfriend ordered another cocktail I can't remember. He'll drink just about anything, but my hot (like, scorching) mulled cider was frickin' delicious after it cooled enough to drink it. The bartender told us the process, which involves lots of warm spices, local cider and high proof Bullet whisky combined and warmed just to the point before a boil, so the alcohol stays potent. It did. Sheesh! My face was so warm after that cocktail! Very much recommended.   We used our group deal, which let us choose a couple of small plates and two entrees. I was absolutely in love with their pickle platter. We were given the option to try half fried pickles and half traditional, since I'm more of a pickle purest. Welp, when it comes to delicious fried pickles, they nailed it. Loved how super-vinegar-y they were without a significant garlic punch that sticks with you. Secondly, do yourselves a favor and try their mini corn dogs. I didn't know what to expect, but these little bombs of delicious are made with bratwurst and served with a honey mustard dipping sauce. In my opinion, you could eat these without the sauce, but combined, it's still great.   On to entrees! Here's where Toast fell just shy of 5 stars... I had the pan fried perch, which was light, fresh and crispy. It was tasty but didn't wow the heck out of me like the small plates did. I'd certainly recommend the dish, though. My boyfriend ordered the roasted half chicken, which was just a little too greasy for his liking. I thought the rich, deep flavor was there, but I agreed, a little less grease would make it a much  better dish.   Overall, I think it's great stop for pre-evening snacks, small plates and drinks! Just remember it's packed on the weekends."}
{"text":"I haven't written a review for Toast yet?   This little restaurant has a special place in my heart. I visited Toast for the first time about two years ago during part of a jam-packed bar-hopping 1st date night with my Mr. Man. So, every time we go back, it helps me relive those nervous and excited feelings.  Despite the nostalgia, Toast is great at what it does.  I've probably been here at least ten times at this point for Date night, girls night, wine-tasting flights, Classical Revolution even. Every time the service and food are great. The staff smile, joke, possibly even sing to you if you're lucky. The spirits are great and the wine selection is one of the best in the Cleveland area.  The atmosphere is perfect for every occasion. (To me at least.) The space is cozy, warm, rustic, and inviting. It's great for romance or great for hearts-to-hearts.   They change their menu pretty regularly which I love! It means that more often than not, when I come back again I can try something I've never had before and that's really exciting for me. Dishes range for gourmet toasted cheese sandwiches to lamb chops. Side note: I'm a fry-aholic and their fries Do.Not.Disappoint. MMM, perfect little crunchy squooshy waffle fries...     If I see you and you didn't order fries ... I'm gonna give you the look of shame. Get the fries."}
{"text":"First time dining at Toast and I must say  that I enjoyed it. I'd describe it as a smaller intimate space with different levels and sections to sit at, so this combined with a group of five during the Gordon Square Rose Wine Off between Toast and Banter, well, things got pretty crowded. We started with standing at the bar but then moved to a table, luckily though management allowed us to continue with happy hour pricing even though it's usually only offered at the bar. Service was normal, no issues with that. Food is fresh and the menu changes regularly.   *Chicken Wings - These have fish oil on them. I tried a bite of my friend's order and I did not like it. Weird and salty tasting to me.   *Buffalo Cauliflower with Blue Cheese Dip $6 - Oh man this was really tasty! And a big enough portion to share. I would definitely get this again! *Trio of Toasts $7- Three grilled up half slices of bread topped with things like beet hummus, coleslaw and short rib, and cheese with jam and nuts. Simple but good.   I would say this place is a classy spot with higher pricing (not ridiculous though), but happy hour has some great deals and I will definitely be coming back! I think it's a great place to meet friends or lovers for drinks and shareable plates."}
{"text":"Foodie heaven! This just might be the best restaurant in Cleveland. The place is homey and down to earth. The cocktails are outstanding. The chefs seems to treat every single dish as if it is their most important. So well executed! Love this place. They also have great space in the front for a party."}
{"text":"The BEST bloody Mary's and weekend brunch. The back patio is so cozy and cute. The eggs Benedict is delicious and all the menu items are unique. Friendly and attentive staff. This is my go to brunch spot when guests come!"}
{"text":"Very pleased with the service and delicious food at Toast! We were in this weekend with a party of 25 for my sisters bachelorette party! It was easy to make a reservation for the many people and the staff was attentive and timely! Decor was cute as well! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere in a repurposed home. Not overly crowded for a Monday during happy hour, which was to be expected. The beer list was not overwhelming, but it did not fall flat either. An offer of some local crafts to level out the list was nice. A good amount of cocktails offered as well. The menu is short and concise. I had the brisket burger. It was cooked as I ordered and tasted exactly as described in the menu. Nothing mind blowing, but an all around good burger.  I enjoyed this location, but none of the dishes made a lasting impression to make me clammer back anytime soon."}
{"text":"A little on the pricy side but it has a great happy hour and cool atmosphere. I'll definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing the bar as I haven't had the food yet.  The bar is great.  This is going to be one of my regular spots moving forward.    First, I'm so happy to see my favorite local wine expert, Joy, back behind the bar.  She's a combo move of lots-o-knowledge and a no-b.s. personality with an added eye towards great service.  Her presence alone makes this place five-stars.  Second, the wine list is large, varied in price range, and full of awesome.  The wife was able to get a couple great glasses of wine without spending too much.  Third, the bar offers plenty of cocktails and liquor options--there's so many great cocktails maid with the brown liquors that a whiskey guy like me can easily find his happy place.  The barrel aged vieux carre was an especially great drink--you must try it.  No, seriously, try it.    Fourth, I love the atmosphere.  It feels like a neighborhood bar on the inside, but with a touch of class.  It's like this place could have existed there for decades--it has a homey feel to it that just doesn't exist in new joints.  They really kept a feel of this building that I assume had to exist before they started renovating the place.  I love the added touch of  empty wine bottles cemented into the walls along the bar. It looks cool at night, but since some go completely straight through the wall, I'm sure it's super awesome during the day when light shines through.    Overall, the craft cocktails aren't overpriced and they taste oh so delicious, there's something for everyone on the wine list, and even the beer options look good.  This is a good place to hitch up and enjoy booze.  I'm super happy to see this place in Gordon Square."}
{"text":"Love the warm and friendly atmosphere! We ordered the 3 for $35 and everything was perfect expect the chicken is too sweet for me lol. And I do love their mushroom soup. It's a good place to go with friends:)"}
{"text":"Cool little brunch spot. I came here with my family and we were seated at a table that looked to be a horse trough with clear glass put on top of it as a table (coolest table idea ever). The waiter was very attentive and I really enjoyed my food I got the smoked salmon toast. My significant other got the ranchero which j thought was good but could use a little bit more spice. My uncle next to me got the ham which I was not a fan of and my cousins got the skillet which was bland but the potato hash was good with it. Overall pretty good I would consider it 4.5 stars but the skillet and the ham toast could use a bit more work. Service good, price was good although drinks could also get very expensive."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at Toast. We did the small plates route: Trio of Toast, Buffalo Cauliflower, Toad in Hole and the Chicken Wings.  It was awesome! I would definitely have the wings, Toast and cauliflower again.   Staff was great: attentive, friendly and helpful.   Great place to go in Gordon Square!"}
{"text":"As a student as Madison, I look for something fresh, fast, and friendly and over all the food carts I always choose Toast. Great and fresh paninis always! You need to check it out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"This quaint house-turned-winebar near Gordon Square is spectacular. It's warm, friendly and comfortably upscale. The bartenders and servers are the best. They really make you feel welcome and at home.  The wine selection is superb and the tab doesn't kill your bank account.   If you're looking to host a large get together, or just want to bring a group of friends together, you can request the front room of the winebar. It has a large table that comfortably seats 16 as well as smaller tables around. It's separate from the main floor of the restaurant so you really feel like you have your own little space.   This newer winebar is a definitely must try!"}
{"text":"Best grilled cheese panini I have ever had! Try it with the dill dipping sauce. A must have!"}
{"text":"My first experience with Toast came shortly after it opened last year, and I had no expectations whatsoever. We were seated right away, and felt very at home in the cozy little dining room (which literally used to be someone's dining room). I'll just get right to the point - I was wowed. By our drinks, by our food and by the service. From the creative to the classic, they know how to make a cocktail. My husband was thrilled  that the bartender knew what a boulevardier was, and even more impressed that it was made so well AKA to the same proportions he uses when making them at home.  I loved the \"bartender's choice\" option in which you can just give them an idea of what you're in the mood for and they'll whip you up a kind of \"surprise\" drink. It turned out to be a riff on a French 75, which at the time was my go-to pre-dinner drink. So, they were dead on with that!  The food: they have great options for their cheese/meat boards and on this occasion we had fried sweetbreads, pork pate and beef bone marrow. Not at all what I expected walking into the place! None of them were completely spot-on taste-wise, but I felt it was a promising start. I suppose we had had our fill of protein by then, because we both ordered vegetarian entrees: pumpkin oats (a kind of pumpkin risotto) and the lasagnette. Both are still among the best vegetarian dishes I've ever had (the pumpkin oats had an egg from Toast's own coop on it, so maybe that's not vegetarian, but just go with it.) Our dessert is what sealed the deal: an apple cake donut with smoked maple and black pepper ice cream. Sounds like a mess, right? Wrong! It was delicious - every component was present, and working in tandem with each of the other flavors. The smoked flavor was so robust and so unexpectedly delightful. It's been almost a year and that meal still sticks out as one of the most memorable of 2013.   I've been back several times since then, and have always received warm, attentive service from the wait staff and the bartenders. The cocktail and wine list consistently impresses, and although food-wise nothing has matched that first meal, I've never been disappointed with anything I've had. I love their commitment to local products - one evening we spent discussing the kahlua-making process with one of the waiters who brewed the kahlua we were drinking himself. WIth Rising Star coffee, of course. My two tiny complaints: the portions can be small, for the price, depending on what you order. And I wish they offered a few more entrees and/or varied the menu a bit more."}
{"text":"Cool ambience and nice people.  One star off for wish there were more reds by the glass!  Did not eat here but may next time."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this restaurant. The flavors were ho-hum, one of our deserts was inedible and the service was equally ho-hum. I only come to Cleveland once a year, so I try to eat at the best of the best. Toast won't be on my short list next year."}
{"text":"Tasty ginger beer and delicious meats! A real gem in Gordon's Square!"}
{"text":"BRUNCH: In short, flavors are missing. I came for brunch on a Sunday and ordered the Eggs Benedict, Heath Bar (French toast), Ricotta French Toast , and Grilled Tofu  - which were all on a thick slice of sourdough bread. Also ordered the fritters, cheese plate and side of bacon.  I would recommend the Cheese plate to anyone. A great balance of flavors and beautiful spread. I wouldn't recommend the fritters, but they are okay for a side snack.  However, the rest seemed to be lacking. It's either too sweet, too sour, or too bland. Also both 'French toast' style dishes weren't cooked fully - egg whites were still raw inside the bread.  Note, the bacon is more so Canadian bacon (thick ham)."}
{"text":"Was excited to come here but ended up disappointed after having dinner/drinks. The place itself is really cool with a great vibe and awesome set up. It's like an old house turned into a restaurant. The drinks were fine and the service was good, it was really just the food that was dissatisfying. We had the branzino fish entree (big enough for 2) fried cauliflower and the chicory salad. The sauce on the branzino fish was over load and was actually not a huge platter for 2 to share. The salad was soggy and tasteless. Definitely not worth $11.  Since we weren't feeling anything but didn't want to complain we asked for bread. Our waitress said she could \"sell us bread and butter for $5\" which was surprising. $30 entrees and they can't give you free bread?? Overall I would recommend coming here for drinks but not food."}
{"text":"Went for dinner the other night, reasonable wine list, small menu but everything served was in season and tasted great! Love the pickles!!"}
{"text":"Gone here twice and had pretty good experiences both times.  I'm starting to really like the Gordon Square area in general.  This restaurant in particular has a very cozy, rustic and home-y feel, which was not what I expected, but quite nice.  They have some creative cocktails - no sense in naming them here because they change quite frequently - but my friends and I tried a couple of different ones and they were all very good.  They have appetizers, sort of medium-sized plates, and entrees.  The one qualm I do have about this place is a bit of a lack of variety of the entrees.  For example, this last time, the choices were - burger, fish &chips, chicken, veggie dish, and gnocchi.  The first three choices were reminiscent of bar food to me, which I didn't want from this place, which left the veggie dish and the gnocchi if I wanted meat.  I ended up ordering two smaller plates - the lamb stew and mushroom crepe - which, by the way, were delicious!  So I guess, all in all this restaurant is a nice, cozy place that is terrific for drinks and tapas."}
{"text":"Hadn't tried Toast until today- I thought $7 was a little too pricey for a sandwich, but I had a Yelp coupon and I'd heard rave reviews.  The hype set my expectations high-and I wasn't disappointed.  I ordered the Veggie panini and got a side of the Dill and Sriacha dipping sauces.  Although the sandwich wasn't huge for the price, it was SO good- no wonder theres always a substantial line.  The panini was loaded with fresh spinach, onions, olives, other veggies, and melted provolone-the garlic mayo sauce was delicious, and the sandwich was perfectly pressed.  I loved the spicy Sriacha dipping sauce, and the Dill sauce was addicting, creamy, and herb-y.  The guys in the cart were super friendly and nice, and they even gave me a coupon for next time.  Great experience, will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Toast is a quaint, farm-style restaurant with a really unique selection, not just toast! The decor is very rustic, very rustic and pairs well with the menu and mismatched coffee cups (very hipster, but I enjoyed it). Visited for brunch and was really excited by the many vegetarian options.The food is wholesome and filling with a great attention to detail.  BUT let me just call out my appreciation for the vegetarian gravy. Give a vegetarian the opportunity to have gravy-covered, fried-egg-topped fries, and she's all for it. Dee-lish! The zucchini toast was topped with super fresh zucchini and beautiful heirloom tomatoes.  Now, I know I was there for Sunday brunch, but the service was painfully slow, especially considering the small number of tables at the time. But the food was worth it!"}
{"text":"Toast! Man this is an awesome truck. In fact it was the only way I could get my husband to come to the Art Fair on the Square by telling him Toast would be there. These paninis are amazing with such interesting combinations and flavors. Very friendly staff too."}
{"text":"I really like their fresh, seasonal menu and imaginative adult beverage list. That seasonality means that sometimes they will be out of things you want to eat, but roll with the punches. I like the space, the vibe, and the constantly changing menu. The staff has always been friendly, approachable, and more than willing to spend time explaining menu items."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday for happy hour.  They had drink and beer specials along with food.  I got the toast trio that had egg salad, anchovies, and a brussels sprouts toast and the cottage fries to share.  The person I was with also ordered the grilled cheese.  Food was very good and quick to come out.  The place was not crowded.  Very relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Leave your preconceived notions at home and trust the amazingly talented staff at Toast  to treat you to a unforgettable experience.  A laid back setting, with an upscale approach. The walls littered with local artwork and the furnishings worn and shabby chic. The care and effort put into each aspect of this restaurant is far beyond anything you would expect.   We started with a duo cheese and meat plate served with a pairing of toast.  Additionally we ordered a peach and ricotta salad. Now, here is were  they truly shine, allow the staff to pair your beverages with your small plates. They came out with this amazing concoction of top shelf gin, ginger, honey, citrus with fresh sage. It complimented the plates so well. Incredibly  sophisticated and delicious.   Dessert was even more impressive. Fresh apple fritters, a lemon and berry curd served over rustic toast and a chocolate compote topped with berries. Each delectable dish perfectly paired with digestifs. A crisp white wine with the fritters, a bright flowery citrus liquor with spices for the lemon curd and a cherry sherry with the compote. Each more outstanding with each sip and bite.   Trust the staff and let them do what they do best and treat you to an amazing experience."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the Gordon Square neighborhood!  The back splash on the bar is very unique. It is made of multiple empty bottles cemented into the wall. Some of the bottles go all of the way through the wall and the sun shines through depending on the time of day. Beautiful!! They also had a great playlist of music in the background.  I started off with a Chardonnay and the boyfriend had a Moscow Mule. The menu is mostly tapas, so its a great place to share food with someone else. We ordered the cheese plate to start off with, which was fantastic. The cheeses change depending on what the local producers have on hand. I then had the cheese ravioli and my man had the beef and leek (tart?). Both of our meals were delicious! It was just enough food for a light dinner. Toast seems like a great place to have a coupe of drinks and just hang out.  The staff was incredibly friendly, and word on the street is they will be adding a patio soon :)"}
{"text":"Happy Hour was outstanding.  We had a group of 5 and loved every appetizer. Trio of toast was amazing, cheese plate fabulous, buffalo cauliflower was addictive, chips and dip.. yum. Cottage fries my least favorite but the group loved them. Did realize after we left that they never brought one of our appetizers but we weren't charged and had plenty without it.  So the only downfall is that they said they had a large group the night before and had run out of almost every red wine. They said their order comes in tomorrow, but truly disappointing that they were out of almost every red.  La Morandina Moscato was amazing and honestly my new favorite.  Great patio great musician Sam Winterberger.   Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"When I read the raving reviews, I think, \"Were we at the same restaurant?!?!\". The female bartender was the best part of this place, hence 2 stars instead of one. She made a special drink for me so it tasted like a wine they didn't stock. Our waitress recommended a couple of strange appetizers that tasted awful. When I asked her for another drink, it took me 3 times to ask before I got it. I had dropped my cloth napkin.,Again, 3 requests before I got it. Burger was decent, but $13 for just a burger? Prices were very, very high. Very limited menu. Chairs uncomfortable. We had to seat ourselves. Won't be back!!!! Go someplace else...not worth the time or money!!! On second thought, changed to one star. Also, they weren't very crowded, so that can't be their excuse whatsoever!!"}
{"text":"Kevin is the best bartender in Cleveland.  I'm serious! He created a signature drink for my wedding reception almost a year ago... Then when I stopped into Toast and asked for the \"bartenders choice\" drink, I was rewarded with a wonderful creation.  He has a great memory and a great sense of flavor combinations.  Finally, while I was pregnant he made a great ginger virgin cocktail."}
{"text":"Atmospheric, personable, quaint, off-to-the-side and full of character, Toast is a solid choice for intimate gatherings, date nights or a solo glass (bottle?!) of wine. The split levels and various rooms give it that \"at home vibe.\" The Cottage Fries is the only thing I've had on the food menu. The salt and vinegar seasoning was as advertised, with the rich house aioli and the sweet tomato jam as the sauces. Took a little while to get the fries, but when it was discovered they were accidentally sent to another table, the bartender herself went back to the kitchen to expedite the process - a good testament to the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Totally my favorite spot right now. Great food (try the 30-min chicken), great old-timely cocktails, great atmosphere.   But don't go there- I want it all to myself..."}
{"text":"I love it here! I'm pretty fussy when it comes to atmosphere and Toast nails it - cozy, warm, nice lighting. Cocktails are well crafted and delicious. Seasonal drinks are right on the mark. I particularly enjoyed the hot cider - which was not overly sweet and hit a lot of hot toddy overtones. The food is fabulous with lots of local and seasonal choices. Original spins on favorites that aren't too out of the park - very comfortable. Service is always personalized and the staff is very knowledgable. Toast is a gem for a romantic night out or just hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"Had a group of girls come here for a bachelorette party. Talked to the chef Joe and set it all up. He accommodated us doing a wine tasting and then we ordered whatever food we pleased. The decor, the ambiance and the people were very inviting and comfortable.  The food was amazing. The patio is so cute and I can't wait to try it for brunch now that they have a brunch menu. Alice was our server and she was amazing. Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Awesome! A fantastic food truck. Excellent panini and very friendly staff. One of the only food trucks on the Library Mall to accept credit/debit, so A+ for you, Toast! The \"build your own panini\" option is great. I really enjoyed the ham, mozzarella, pesto, and garlic mayo panini. It was \"da bomb!\" The only thing that would make the food truck better would be prices that are a tad lower. But overall, this is a fantastic restaurant. I will definitely be visiting it again! :)"}
{"text":"Never again, mark my words!   I really wanted to like this place and I did till our service was non-existent. Stopped in after work for happy hour with a girl friend. Decided to sit in their lounge area because it looked so cozy. It only looks cozy but if it's cold and windy outside then it's cold and windy inside by the windows as well. They really need to invest into new windows because it was very cold!   Their happy hour menu looked good, 2$ off of wine and food specials. We ordered the trio to start. It was literately 3 pieces of toast (actually half of pieces of toast) topped with different things. One had hummus, one had tapenade and the third had a beet spread. The saddest trio for 7$. Then we ordered the cheese plate, I didn't think it could get worse but it did. The cheese plate was 2 different types of cheese and 6 pieces of tiny toast....for 12$. We also ordered the Rice & Bean burger which was ok just dry.   We started with a glass of wine each, we finished our wine then waited about 10-15 min before the server came to ask if we wanted more. We both ordered another glass of wine. After we finished the second glass we waited and waited and waited. The table in front of us was served 7 times before our server came back to us to refill our wines. By that time we had enough and just asked for the bill.   When we received the bill, she had charged us full price for everything! We ordered everything during happy hour, had an awful time and awful service and she charged us full price. When we told her that she charged us full price she said \"Oh I didn't even notice.\" She ended up changing the bill, we paid and left never to return."}
{"text":"Cute, quaint, chill neighborhood vibe.  We stopped by Toast this weekend, looking for something new to try. Having heard some reviews about Toast, we decided to stop in.  The decor is cute- kind of rustic looking and the type of restaurant where it looked like the owner put his own touches of art in the place-wine bottles in plastered art, metal spirals around the lights, and so on. We sat down on one of the benches by the windows (with pillows), and sipped some water out of our mason jars as we looked at our food choices.  First, we went with the brandade pierogies-cured pollock, cheddar, potatoes. It was  small, but good and rich-very flavorful.  We moved on to the root vegetables-we definitely loved this dish, cooked with tons of flavor and not too oily at all. You could definitely taste the spicy coconut in it too.  We finished off with the mushroom gnocchi- with oyster mushrooms and shallot sauce. The sauce was so rich and the gnocchi so good, it was a great way to end the night. I almost wishes they made a soup form of this dish! Super tasty.  Although I was disappointed with their dessert list (only three items, no chocolate, and then everything else was alcoholic), I still enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. Our waiter was super cool as well which made a great experience.  Eat, drink, and toast. Head to Toast for a light and satisfying meal!"}
{"text":"A great little gem that adds so much to the shoreway area! The wings are delicious, sticky, crispy, heaven. A charming atmosphere, perfect for a romantic date."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and great service. Came here on a Friday night with some friends.   The small plates are great to share for large groups. The cauliflower and spaghetti squash dishes were great. The scallops dish was a nice blend of flavors but only two scallops served, which was underwhelming. As mentioned by others the cottage fries were excellent.  Drinks were fantastic. The bourbon cocktail was tasty and paired well with many food items. The wine and beer selection were also great for the party.  Overall somewhat pricey for the area, but perfect for dates or small groups. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I came in for Happy Hour with a girlfriend a couple weeks ago, and thoroughly enjoyed our visit. The restaurant itself had a very nice, cozy feel to it, and drinking wine, eating small plates and enjoying the warm company was a very pleasant way to spend an evening.  We both had the Happy Hour wine (the Rose, not sure what kind...), the Buffalo Cauliflower and Fried Pickles.   The Buffalo Cauliflower was so good! I have been dying to go back to order it again, as well as to check out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the most under-rated restaurants in Cleveland. Every dish, cheese, meat, appetizer or drink that I've had here has been nothing short of outstanding.   The dimly lit, sort of rustic, cozy interior is perfect if it's your first date, your 50th date or just a night out with your friends. The menu always has something that catches my eye -- even when I swear I'm only there for drinks!  The cheese and charcuterie is always a go-to and may be some of the best in the area.   What keeps me always coming back is the cocktails (no one is surprised) -- they have classics and also some very creative, balanced tasty drinks. The wine list is also not boring and has a lot of interesting options.   Toast is easily becoming one of my favorite CLE restaurants."}
{"text":"Toast has both a Saturday and a Sunday brunch with pretty late hours up to 3:30pm. The place was basically empty around 1p - no reservation needed.   The starters were the highlight of the brunch for me. I enjoyed the Latkes appetizer. The starter comes with three potato pancakes. They were dense and topped with hollandaise. The flavours were all good, though the hollandaise had been allowed to settle and congeal a bit before the dish was served.   For being basic and simple, the Greek Yogurt and Fruit appetizer was really good too. The plain yogurt serving was large, in an oversized mug. A layer of finely diced skin-on apples covered the top of the yogurt. The apples were sweetened with a bit of honey and something citrus - orange - flavored.   For the brunch mains I ordered the Toast Skillet. This dish was massive. The menu lists two fried eggs, bacon, sausage, breakfast fries and of course toast with seasonal jam. I was assuming I would be given a choice of meats, but no I was given both. The bacon was thick cut, not fatty and was delicious. The jam was also a highlight of the dish. There were fresh diced apples in it. The entrée was a bit carb heavy with a ton of potato discs on the plate as well as the two large pieces of toast.   The 3 Egg Soft Scramble also had a great flavor. It was a basic scrambled egg mixed with corn and peppers and tomatoes, but served spread on top of a thick piece of toast."}
{"text":"Toast has been on my \"must try\" list for probably a year. When my birthday finally rolled around, it made it to the top of the list and we went their for brunch. First off, the inside is beautiful. The design is right up my alley, I just love it. I ordered the smoked salmon platter and it was sooo good. All the right flavors and textures to pair with the salty, savory, smoked salmon. They get their bagels from Cleveland Bagel, so big thumbs up there. My boyfriend got the eggs Benedict and he was delighted, too. I can't to come back for dinner sometime soon!"}
{"text":"We visited Toast for Saturday Brunch while we were visiting Cleveland and we loved it! We sat at the bar and there was a neat wall made of wine bottles. Solid brunch menu, the Bloody Mary was excellent. Boyfriend got a mimosa and it was delicious as well. I ordered the Pizza Bagel without the sausage and added the fried egg on top. The bagel was perfectly chewy, the fried egg made the dish for me. My boyfriend got the eggs benedict (he has an obsession with it) and loved every bite of it. I managed to snag a bite from him and it was really delicious. If we ever have to travel back to Cleveland this is on our list of places to go back to."}
{"text":"Martinis definitely did the job, bartender had quite the heavy hand. I was annihilated! The prices in this little place are outrageous. Im nowhere near cheap, but man!  Enough said here."}
{"text":"This place is deceiving.  Looking into the front window, you'd think the place was closed.  They were open and have a really cute patio area in the back that is dog friendly.  The menu is eclectic but tasty.  My only complaint is that the portions are really small.  I had the scallops which were delightful - just really small.  My husband had pasta which he really liked.  The prices are high, esp for that area of town, but the ambience of the big tree and twinkly lights was exceptional.  We would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Very pleased with the food and service. Went for happy hour and did a mix of happy hour and regular priced food and drink. All were great. The prices weren't bad for either, though maybe slightly high for regular priced food. All in all though, I'd say it was worth it. Good, strong cocktails, decent beer menu, and a mix of food offerings.  The frites are enough to feed a family of four and SO GOOD! The burger was also a big hit with my party. The staff was all very friendly and attentive in a perfect amount - no hovering but they were there when we needed them.  The space itself is very inviting, bright and open, and the patio looked like a great place to relax. This is a hidden gem in the Detroit Shoreway neighborhood. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The word on the street is that Toast is pretty amaze-balls.  With that much hype, it's difficult to live up to it, but Toast sure did try it's best!  We had a wonderful server who kindly handled my fiance's barrage of questions (that didn't have anything to do with the meal) and he was both knowledgeable and quick with our drinks and meal.    I was honestly impressed by the wine selection.  Unusual and worldly wines (I ordered one from Tokaj Hungary and one from Stellenbosch SA) paired well with our Price Fixe menu.    We got a selection of things (some things were already sold out so we had a limited menu).  The pate was good, but didn't blow us away, but we were very happy with the plates in general.  The aged ribeye was delicious and perfectly done, and the corn \"succotash\" meal was spot-on.    Very happy and I will return!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely fantastic. Even the cheese plater was very satisfying. The wine selection was very diverse and covered most palates at the table. This would truly be a place for a date or a meeting with old friends."}
