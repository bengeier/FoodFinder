{"text":"There's nothing quite like bbq over charcoal ... Great service, delicious food and the price is reasonable for how much food you're offered. The bartender makes really interesting cocktails... Music is on point ... I'll be back!"}
{"text":"really enjoyed the seafood buffet here. creative menu and servers were prompt and friendly. black cod bbq is a must-try item!"}
{"text":"I ate here last night and noticed many key items were changed on the menu since my last visit several months ago.  The cold bar
area that once served smoked
salmon and crab legs is no longer available.  The melt-in-your-mouth buttermilk ribeye pieces have been swapped out for slices of some other Brazilian cut of beef.  There is no longer any ceviche -the only raw fish on the menu is the nigiri and rolls. The bacon wrapped cod and scallops were good but couldn't quite make up for the missing items.  Dessert is always limited to grilled pineapple and bananas but they're delicious nonetheless. Service was great and the grilled food came out continuously but I wasn't quite satisfied with the meal.  $35 for what Copa by Sea used to offer was an amazing deal. I likely will not come back here again."}
{"text":"I'd like to say this is 3.5/5. For the most part food is good. They basically bring you one round of everything that is on the menu, then you can request for something you like again. This is for a special bday, so the price for bday is FREE!!! (With 3 full paying customers) lol

They offer 4 raw oysters per person and any extra is $$. That also includes the umedashi scallops 4 pp. But unfortunately that day they can only offer ONE pp, and will give extra on their black cod. Black cod is usually 4pcs pp as well.

There's a small section you can order from your server, and then the rest, the guys bring on skewers...

The Good:
- Blue point oysters with some chili like sauce was nice, although at times I caught a shell while chewing.
- Grilled Black Cod is very nice and buttery texture... They were boneless as well which is a plus.
- Salmon Carpaccio is bite sized but they were tasty.
- Garlic shrimp. Its good, but starts to wear out your tongue after a few of those.
- Unagi sushi. Surprisingly their quality is better than most ayce Jap places!
- Dynamic roll...I know, its surprisingly well rolled and made.
- Tandoori Mahi Mahi. Very tender and flavourful.
- Grilled pineapple.

The Poor:
- Crab legs. They were the cold ones, and they were TASTELESS!!!

The others I did not list were only okay, but not poor. Our server was helpful in the initial beginning and then she kind of disappeared after, and someone else came by to assist us.
7 ppl = $400 w/tips! I'd say its the most expensive ayce I've been a part of, its definitely a higher end buffet joint.

Its quite dark since its downstairs and also can be quite cold, so prepare to bring a sweater or jacket for the ladies...or partner whichever you fancy...=P"}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was fast and friendly. As mentioned in other posts, most of the food was quite salty. The place got quite noisy after being about half filled and it is difficult to move to the buffet from your table. Also noticed that those waiting for a table had to wait a long time. I houses being fairly new they are still working out the kinks."}
{"text":"First off, the food is DELICIOUS, I just want to put that out there, so if you love seafood, this is the place for you. The fishes on the menu are cooked very well, and they simply melt in your mouth... 

BUT the amount of food you get to eat and enjoy is very very little, and you may be telling yourself, \"But isn't this an all you can eat place?\" And you sir or madam are correct, and you will get all you can eat IF YOU ARE WILLING TO WAIT A VERY LONG TIME. 

I put an emphasis on the \"VERY LONG\" because you can wait for up to 30-40 minutes and still not know where your food is, or even where your server is. Yes, you heard me correctly, your SERVER. You may even get, not one, not two, but FOUR SERVERS helping you, and still not know where they are.

Seriously, this mess of a seafood place tests your patience, and you may even walk away without getting seconds of a particular menu item that you enjoyed. 

Oh you think you're out of the clear? Think again! When you ask for your bill, that is another leg of your patience that will be tested, because of your missing servers. Oh and did I mention that this meal is very expensive, and you get very little for what you pay for.

On top of that, their menu isn't even updated... your server (if they even show up) will tell you that many of the menu items are discontinued; but I digress, you might be there today and they've finally updated their menu so thumbs up for that (maybe). 

This place definitely deserves a thumbs up for its great tasting food, but one thumb is all it'll get. It is bogged down by absent food, absent servers, and a menu that has absent items. 

Verdict: NOT WORTH"}
{"text":"We came here on a double date with some friends on Saturday. First of all I have to say that the server we had was excellent (and hot! They all were!) Wasn't expecting much service because we knew it was an AYCE restaurant but we were blown away by how hospitable she was. We were seated in a corner booth by the kitchen and got to watch our food being cooked on the grill which was a neat experience. The food was outrageous!!!! specifically the garlic shrimp and ribeye which was cooked to perfection! Loved the raw Oysters too - definitely a must try. Cocktails were fantastic - My girl had the Copa Sangria and loved it. A must-try if you are looking for a date spot. We will surely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible!! The wait time for the food was so long. Waited for almost an hour for the branzino to come, even though we reminded the waitress several times. The ceviche was so sour and it's not what it supposed to taste like. And it's not really all you can eat. They limit the number of dishes that you can order every time. And I was really disappointed with the food quality.

It's not worth the money. And I don't see it getting better any time soon either."}
{"text":"Food was average given the price point. And everything was very salty! I don't think we will every go back."}
{"text":"Checked out Copa by Sea on a  Sunday night with a small group of 6 as we were all excited to try out this all you can eat seafood menu. The environment was nice, with a great background of lounge music set to the perfect volume which allowed proper conversation with others. Staff was wonderful, helpful, and service was great. Food came at a great pace with a variety of different seafood options. We were given more then the average 4 pieces of oysters per person which was a bonus. Food was appetizing and the options were great. We were able to try everything on the menu at least once and were approached by two servers asking if we preferred anything specific from the grill. Starter share options were small portions for the 6 of us, but we just order multiple orders of the dishes we loved. Portions were small but perfect, so no wasted food! Unfortunately our table did not order any of the sushi as we didn't need it with all the grilled options. If you want sushi, go to a sushi restaurant. Every grilled item brought to the table was cooked perfectly and really exceeded our expectations. Great place to hang out with a  small group and their special price of $30 is priced right for what you get. (Approx: $90-$100 per couple including drinks and tip) Worth the trip to check it out."}
{"text":"A very disappointing experience. 

The service was unacceptable and slow.

Went here to treat a friend and I wish we had gone somewhere else. Our server just sat us in our table and left without explaining how to order.  We ended up asking the table close to us.  The servers who brought the skewers were awkward and when we inquired about the dish they just said the name without elaborating what was actually on it.  We had to flag almost all the servers with the skewers. Our server seemed like she was just ignoring us. So rude! 

Food was also a big disappointment. Pricey. All were too salty the only item that was not salty was the pineapple! 

Never ever going back!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying the main reason for two stars is terrible service. Why that big of a hit on the stars? It's called the \"service industry\". Service is the most basic part. A McDonald's could have great service. Working as a server for 4 years in both low end and middle of the road places, it's really not that difficult to get that part right. 

Made 8:00 reservations and showed up at 7:55. We were told they were getting the table ready. After checking with them twice, we were finally seated at 8:30pm. The hostesses were not apologetic and had a look as if we were inconveniencing them by showing up on time. Again, not a single \"sorry\". How hard is that? 

We get to the table, and the server taking care of us is friendly enough. Now, with copacabana, the concept is that people come around with food on skewers, explain what it is and serve it to you if you're interested. This is the whole concept behind their restaurant and is supposed to be an all you can eat mentality. It took a good 20 minutes for the first person to show up with food! At this point both my wife and I are really hangry with how the evening has started. The skewers of food being walked around were fairly sparse so you get to a point where you're fed up but not really full. I almost think they do it on purpose- get you to the point of your body saying no more, but you haven't really had much to eat. 

The made to order calamari was my favorite dish, the all you can eat skewers of scallops were my wife's favorite. They were out of maybe 3 items on the made to order menu. 

A restaurant like this is not necessarily about the food, but the experience and ambience. The only thing they get an acceptable pass in is the food. Oh and the dancers. There were 6 of them and every one of them was giving it their all when dancing. 

I would never return to this place regardless of the price and as my wife put it, \"if a friend had a birthday here, I would fake sick\". 

As a side note, the meat version at Yonge and Eg was somewhere we would return to."}
{"text":"Good food. Comically bad service. 

This will be a long review, so to summarize:

1. Waited 30 minutes to be seated.
2. Did not receive the food I ordered (sea bass ceviche) 
3. Some of the food I ordered and did get was not as advertised (tuna ceviche and branzino) 
4. Got food I did not order (mac and cheese and fried calamari) 
5. They were out of some items on the menu (oysters)
6. Staff were confused and unapologetic 

I made reservations for 8:30 PM on a Thursday. The staff at the front desk looked up at me every 10 minutes saying it would be just another minute. I was finally seated at 9:00 PM with no apology.  

Copacabana by Sea is an all you can eat, made to order, seafood restaurant. They start you off with a seafood chowder and rice, and then allow you to order 3 items off of the menu at a time. Waiters also walk around with grilled fish and shrimp on skewers which are not on the menu. 

I decided to start with 3 orders of ceviche - sea bass, tuna, and salmon. The salmon ceviche arrived within 5 minutes. It was good, but the flavours were overpowered by the vinegar. After finishing the salmon, I advised the waitress that the other 2 orders had not arrived, she looked confused (which became the theme of the night) and said she would look into it. In the meantime, she took my next order of branzino, grilled calamari, and black cod.    

The grilled calamari arrived, followed by the tuna ceviche. The calamari was excellent. The tuna ceviche was once again overpowered by the vinegar - it also came with the wrong ingredients as part of the fish salad. 

The next items to arrive were the black cod, which was delicious, and lobster mac and cheese and deep fried calamari, which I didn't order. The calamari was bland and no better than the pre-breaded and frozen stuff you can get at Costco. The lobster mac and cheese on the other hand was excellent - cheesy with large chunks of lobster. 

I advised the waitress about an hour into the meal that I had still not received the ceviche and that I believed the the table to our right had received our branzino as they looked surprised when it arrived at their table. She had a puzzled look and said she would look into it. She also took my order for pan seared octopus and panko fried oysters. They were out of oysters... 

5 minutes later I saw a waiter arrive with my branzino (a whole fish which is grilled and cleaned at your table). The wait was finally over! Except that he turned and gave it to the people seated to the table on our left, who had gotten there 15 minutes ago and still hadn't had a chance to order their second round of food. Once again, my food was stolen and I could see the thieves enjoying what what rightfully mine. 

The waitress arrived with my order of octopus, which was good. I once again told her that I was still waiting for the branzino and the ceviche and she said that she would look into it. 

10 minutes later, a plate of fish that looked like it had been attacked by a cat arrived at the table. The waiter apologized for the appearance and assured us that it was fresh branzino and not someone's left overs. For the record, when a waiter introduces a food by explaining that the shards of fish remains are not from someone else's plate despite what it may look like, it doesn't inspire confidence. He told me that while the fish is usually cleaned at the table in front of guests, he did it at the grill because he thought it was undercooked. I decided to try a bit of the ripped apart carcass only to discover that it was dry and overcooked. I am now confident that I ate reheated leftovers. 

The meal ended with grilled pineapple, which is always a good way to end things."}
{"text":"The service was great -- we were seated immediately on a Thursday night, even though we arrived 15 minutes early for an 8pm reservation.

We were told how everything worked up front -- there were unlimited king crab legs and shrimp at the counter, and everything else was all you can eat (except for oysters: you could have a max of 4 per person and any on top of that was $1 each).  They brought us out the sides (calamari, onion rings and fries) and signature dishes (lobster & shrimp mac n' cheese, soba noodle salad) to start, and you could order ceviche or sushi rolls as you pleased (the ceviche was a bit too fruity but still good).

The rest of the food came on skewers.  It was really great that the portions were small, so you could try a little bit of everything.  Our favourites were the Umadashi Scallops and Black Cod, but everything was excellent.  There was constantly food being brought around, and we could ask for extra portions of our favourites.

I asked the manager about the earlier bad reviews, and he admitted that there were some hiccups in the beginning, but they had sorted most of it out and still had a few adjustments to make.  We did not find anything to complain about, and would definitely come again, especially for the price of $30 per person."}
{"text":"The food was good, lots of varieties of seafood and flavors. For the most part everything was really tasty and fresh off the grill, so fresh that we had to wait for it to cool down first.   We had lots of scallops, shrimps and bacon wrapped cod, delicious.
We had later reservations (9:00), so there were only a 5-6 other tables there.  The waitress was friendly and attentive.  The guys with the skewers going around to the tables were also friendly and often left more food than we requested.  There was also king crab available at the bar on a serve yourself basis.  This was a nice surprise as it was not on the menu.
Bottom line - you cannot get this much tasty seafood anywhere for a price as good as this."}
{"text":"All of the seafood items from the grill were amazing. Especially liked the black cod and Chilean seabass. We were also served a parmasean steak that was cooked perfectly. Servers were very interactive with our table and friendly. Sushi was good but the grilled items is what you go there for!"}
{"text":"I would give a rating of 2.5 stars if I could. I'll start off by saying that the food, especially the cod and lobster mac & cheese is amazing. However the food isn't good enough to cancel out the shitty service we received. The manager of this place is awesome, but unfortunately the FOH staff except for a couple of servers bring the place down. 

I made a reservation for two people last Wednesday for 8:30pm. I'm not sure that the hostesses know what the point of a reservation is.... It's to reserve a table for a certain time. We arrived at the restaurant at about 8:32pm and we were told that the table is almost ready. Around 8:45pm I checked on the status and was told \"the people are about to pay and hopefully they leave right after\". The hell.. the table should have been blocked off before the reso and if they sat a table around 7pm they should have given a 1.5hr time limit. Needless to say, we weren't seated until 9pm. 

When we finally sat down and ordered. We received the food before getting any cutlery. After ten minutes and asking three different staff members, a server finally brought some out. If I'm paying a minimum of $30/head before taxes, tips and beverages I'd expect to at least get some freaking cutlery. My date and I were taking turns sharing a spoon. Classy. 

If you decide to dine here, try to book a reservation earlier than you'd like to be seated to make sure you're actually seated on time. 

Cheers."}
{"text":"Excellent ayce seafood unfortunately closed down recently. I was lucky to enjoy the buffet before that. 
Amazing sushi as well. Great job guys."}
{"text":"I don't know why there is a chunk of bad reviews on this place. I came here with my girlfriend this past Sunday and boy was I impressed at the service and the food. There was never a time where we felt like we weren't catered to. Even though it was a busy night, our server made sure our drinks were topped, our dishes were bussed, and our orders came swiftly. The waiters who bring in the foods from the rodizio, made sure we had a sample for the two of us before tending to the bigger tables.  And they also made sure we had a lot of what we wanted and special ordered things that we haven't tried. Aside from the stellar service, the food was spot on. Everything from the grill was delicious and cooked to perfection. The raw foods are no exception. Everything was fresh and tasty. Don't hesitate to come here as a big group or as a couple. Everybody was friendly, the food was delicious and you leave satisfied. The managers here really know how to emphasize customer service. Epic experience. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This was really good he first time I went but since then it's on a steady decline. The waiters only visited the table a hand fill of times and a lot of the food was either under or over salted. The tuna on the sushi was a lower grade than I remember and the salad didn't taste as good, very bitter. Probably my last visit."}
{"text":"Do you like salt with a side of seafood?  If so, this is the place for you. I get that it's all you can eat so they want to fill you up but the food was almost inedible.  

The menu looked appetizing and the spread of food was impressive.  They have a variety of seafood, sides and meats available.  If you do eat here I only recommend the oysters (limit 4 per person), scallops, cod, lobster mac and cheese and grilled pineapples.  That's about all you will be able to eat before you need to chug down a pitcher of water.

The service wasn't as bad as most of the reviews I read.  Most of the staff was fast and friendly.  The manager even came to the table to apologize for any delays due to the large party they had that night.

The decor is chic and the low-lighting gave off a romantic vibe, which I found weird for a buffet.  I'd be willing come back if they simmered down on the sodium content, but from my experience you're better off going to the mandarin."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner and food and service was great. Especially liked the garlic shrimp, black cod, salmon teriyaki, green dragon sushi, kale and quinoa salad, and lobster Mac and cheese. I was also there in October 2015 and have noticed their menu selections have decreased, key items like peel and eat shrimp and crab legs are gone, in addition to other items. Fortunately, what they have is still great, just less than before. A big downside to last night was that it was freezing cold in the restaurant, like the heat was not turned on!!  Our table had to order hot drinks to warm us up and those drinks turned cold as ice during our meal. Towards the end of our meal, it got even colder. Not sure what's going on but they really need to invest in some heaters because it was uncomfortable."}
{"text":"We came here on Christmas Eve. I had a good experience upstairs so I thought the seafood would be good too. But I was wrong. We were seated at the far side of the restaurant and it was super hard to get a second round of anything. The fish was OK. In the end we just ordered the grilled pineapples and they were not as good as those we had upstairs. 

The waitress explained that we had to ask for more food but that was not the experience I had upstairs in the steakhouse. I doubt it's true. They need a better strategy to serve food otherwise some customers are just not  going to get anything."}
{"text":"This place is not by any means worth hyping or getting goosebumps over. It was an almost painful experience at this restaurant.

 I came here during their ladies night deal which was half-off the seafood menu from what i recall (my male friends paid full price, lol sucks for them). My friend had originally booked tables for 7pm, and we didn't get seats until 8:30pm! The wait was almost unbearable. 

The servers were mostly responsive and friendly enough, so that wasn't the problem. I found that they lacked a lot of variety in their menu. 

The servers went around with their skewers and cutlery and offered grilled salmon, steak, some kind of pork, and some grilled shrimp. They tasted alright. They had a lobster and salad bar which my friend liked because he would keep going back for seconds, and thirds, and fourths lol. I particularly don't enjoy eating plain lobster, so i didn't care. I absolutely loved their Mac and lobster cheese pasta though, it was absolutely divine. It was part of the all-you-can-eat menu, and you can bet that I had three bowls of that! It was heavy, filling, and deliciously savoury. Clearly I'm a Mac and cheese kinda girl haha. 

Dessert menu at Copa by the Sea was poorly planned out! The restaurant offered nothing special or even worthy of mentioning. It was basically just caramelized bananas and pineapples with chocolate drizzle...I was so disappointed they didn't even offer any kind of cake or ice cream *sniffs*. 

Overall, this place was a hit and miss. I tried to enjoy what I could (the Mac and lobster cheese was awesome), but it was sub- par. Almost everything on the AYCE seafood menu was average for the most part. If it wasn't for the deal I had, I wouldn't even imagine coming here for a full-price meal!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at Copa By Sea, and returned for a birthday celebration. I called ahead and made reservations and mentioned it was a birthday celebration.
The service was pretty good at first, and then it tapers off (maybe purposely ?). They've changed the crab legs and shrimp from self serve to served by the waiter. The sushi was pretty good, definitely better than what I imagined. The fish, is simply amazing. My favourites were the teriyaki salmon, black cod, spicy Chilean sea bass and scallops. The other items are good too, but those are the ones that stood out for me. Unfortunately I filled up on sushi, so I just had one of a few of the rodizio items and barely any sides (lobster Mac and cheese and sweet potato fries with a yummy spicy sauce). Based on this, I would give copa a minimum of 4 stars. However after mentioning I wanted some sort of birthday celebration (ie a candle or just something to make it extra special) when making my reservations 3 days before, upon entering to the woman who was seating us AND not so subtly at the table after dessert was served, there was no 'festivity' and i was super irritated. When I mentioned not so subtly to the waiter after our dessert was eaten she said sorry it must have been miscommunication on the phone and they may not have heard me (they did, and said for birthdays the meal is complimentary and a special dessert), so she apologized and said to my brother 'how about a free meal' which while great as a restaurant to offer, she made it seem like she was offering it just for us. Not happy with the brush off of any sort of festivity for a birthday celebration and then presented with a free meal which I was well aware of. It ruined the celebration for me (not my brother), because it seems standard when a patron at a restaurant mentions it's a birthday that you stick a candle in dessert. So they definitely have miscommunication problems (or no birthday specials, how cold!) and that needs to be resolved. The food is good. The service from servers seems to decline as you get further through your meal. But the food was worth it. If celebrating something at this restaurant, bring your own festivities!"}
{"text":"As a BBQ intermediate, Rodizio had always something I wanted to give a try but never found the time to visit. I had my first opportunity to this past weekend at Copa By Sea. I was apprehensive, mainly due to the fact that I am allergic to shellfish and some seafood. 

We were a large group, as I was attending a birthday dinner for ma' cuzzinn! We all arrived on time for the set reservation, however we were told that the restaurant was running behind and that we might have to wait longer, however since our 2-hour limit was elapsing, the restaurant would waive the limit. Excellently handled!

The ambience of Copa By Sea is very relaxed and nicely lit, which gives an overall comfort and yet feel as if you and your company are isolated and intimate.

The food was incredible. Although I am allergic to seafood, its mainly caused by chemical traces found in the freezing process. I gave it the test by trying the Sea Bass and I can say surely that the seafood served at Copa is high quality. There were also other surprises served not in the menu, which made up of items the kitchen ran out of for the evening. My table seemed to really love the Lobster Mac and Cheese appetizer, Scallops, Ribeye Steak, and Shrimp.

Service was impeccable as well, with the servers being quick, polite, and engaging. Especially Marcella! She handled our tables like a champ, and we're told it was her first day! 

Used the Yelp! Promo featured in the App for an additional 10% off my cheque.

Next Stop? Copacabana over on Eglinton!"}
{"text":"Why did you turn left when you entered? Isn't it kinda cold down there? Yeah the seafood is probably worth one try at least, but there's steak upstairs. And BBQ'd pineapple.

I was most struck by the oysters, they were good but they didn't blow me out of the water. I liked the sauces they had provided, which were standard fare for this category of dish. You'll definitely want a few of them before you're through. 

We came for a birthday and the atmosphere was great to have a chat around a few drinks. It's a reliable place to be laidback with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's good for someone who can't get enough seafood. The service is very good and you always get an assortment of meats brought to the table without requests."}
{"text":"I booked a 25-person reservation a month prior to our visit.  When we arrived at Copa, it was packed.  The hostess at the front kindly led the way to our tables, which were located on the bottom level of the restaurant (to my dismay).  I had never been to Copa at this location, nor did I ever make a reservation for this large of a group.  I asked the hostess why we were practically sitting in the basement/dungeon... she responded that we had made reservations for Copa by Sea and that it was completely separate from the upstairs restaurant.  I was shocked, as I had no idea the two weren't connected, and quickly spoke to a manager.  There was \"nothing that she could do\".... Basically whoever orchestrated such an awful restaurant layout/design should have been fired right away... What a poor layout.  I was so upset, and rightfully so.  The upstairs was where the 11pm show took place and where all the action was happening (music, lights, etc.).  In addition, I was even more upset when the manager stopped me from going upstairs to the extensive salad bar that we apparently didn't have access to. 

Now, to the food.  It came out rather slowly... maybe it was because we were such a large group... The mac and cheese was oily, the sushi was mediocre at best... Salads were tiny, and the fries were cold.  

Really won't consider ever coming back, especially since the person who confirmed my reservation didn't explicitly explain to me how the levels/floors of the restaurant work.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"My wife and I and another couple went here yesterday for Valentines Day. We have been to the Copacabana steakhouse in Niagara Falls several times and were very anxious to try this seafood version since we were going to be in Toronto for the weekend. There's a parking garage across the street that we used. The atmosphere is very nice althought it was very cold inside the dining room, granted it was about 5 degrees F outside but the restaurant should have been warmer. We dressed casual. We were greeted at the door by the hostess who seemed to be having a stressful day although the restaurant had just opened when we arrived. She led us downstairs to the Copa by the Sea. Our very pleasant and informative server explained how Copa by the Sea runs slightly different than the steak house in that you are served all of the seafood items on the menu so you don't have to worry about missing any items and there is no side buffet like the steakhouse. Trust me the buffet isn't missed with all of the delicious food that is brought to you. Anything that you really like request more right away so that you're not waiting too long due to the various cooking times required for the different types of fish. My favorite was the sea bass which was served a couple of different ways. The spicy sea bass was outstanding! The scallops were perfectly seared and tender. Even the Mahi Mahi, which is usually a tougher drier fish, was tender, seasoned perfectly and taste better than Mahi Mahi that I've had in Hawaii. The grilled garlic shrimp is a must have! The lobster mac and cheese was so good I had to stop eating it so that I wouldn't get stuffed too soon.  The eel, crab and salmon sushi was fresh and top of the line. Each person gets four oysters and then additional oysters are a dollar each. They were fresh and tender. The meal ended with grill pineapples and bananas with chocolate syrup and crumbs over them. I don't understand the negative reviews about this place. I suggest you visit Copa By the Sea for yourself despite the negative reviews. If you love seafood you will not be disappointed. We will absolutely dine here each time we make the drive from Buffalo!"}
{"text":"Came here for our anniversary dinner. We were seated in the downstairs area that doesn't have the show. Decor felt upscale with the dark wood, but nothing that particularly stood out. I was a bit disappointed by the food, since I've heard such great things about it. The service was great. We had to wait quite a long time for a table since they mixed up our reservation, but we got treated to a drink on the house. Which was great since we waited about 30 min for our reservation. Wait staff and manager were friendly and professional. Though I did feel that some of the actual food items did come slower. Loved the fresh oysters, one of my favourite dishes of the night. They had this lovely sauce to accompany the oyster, which truly complimented the oysters and tasted great with the other seafood. There were some food lulls and we had to flag the food server to get some of food items like the scallops. Overall the food was a bit on the salty side. I did really enjoy the steak. The garlic shrimp was also tasty. Love the roasted pineapple. Didn't enjoy the banana with chocolate sauce. I felt that the chocolate over powered the banana. Overall there was a variety of seafood, but not sure I'd go back."}
{"text":"The food was good, but we were very disappointed with the ordering system.  When you sit down and have ordered your sides, you see waiters go around with skewers of seafood, but they don't stop by your table.  The waitress we had failed to explain that only after you have placed your side orders does the grill begin cooking your seafood.  They will cook you a first round of everything on the grilling menu. However, if you want seconds, you need to order those separately.  For a buffet, that is confusing.  It would have helped if our waitress had explained it to us.  Further, I didn't necessarily want everything on the first round.  I knew I didn't want the parm buttermilk ribeye, but they came with it anyways.

On our second round, we ordered a few items and only two of the five items actually came.  We reminded our waitress and the hostess four times, but it still didn't come after waiting over 20 minutes.  We spoke with the lady manager and although she listened to us, our food and dessert never came.  We gave up after just under two hours and decided to call it a night. There were only two of us, so it was a very long dinner.  

The food was excellent in many respects, but the gimped up ordering system and the long wait times makes this an event that we will not repeat."}
{"text":"Terrible service for some SUPER salty food served inside a restaurant that looks like a set from Night at the Roxbury

Still not sure who our server exactly was - basically had to flag down ANYONE walking by to get our orders/requests in.  The table my date and I were seated at is usually a 4 top that had been split into two tables - as such we saw many of our requests get delivered to the table beside us.  Took 25 min and asking 4 different wait staff before we got our bill.

Was told that due to the snow in PEI there would be no Oysters -  the \"king crab\" legs are not the giant Alaskan crab legs you usually find but smaller and SUPER salty.  

The black Cod and scallops were well done - everything else was super salty."}
{"text":"All you can eat seafood?? I'm in! I've heard that this place was much better when it first opened and it was more bang for your buck. But yknow what, at$45 a person for all you can eat seafood (even if the oysters are limited) is a pretty good deal I think. I love seafood and I'll eat everything. I brought my mom here for her birthday and it was a great time! I especially loved the seasonal strawberry spinach salad that complimented all the fish so well. The black cod is amazing but that one is limited as well, or else I would've only eaten that. The waitress brought a surprise dessert for my mom as a birthday gift so I thought that was a really sweet touch. Would come back for sur"}
{"text":"My fiance and I came here last Saturday for dinner.  We tried Copa Cabana last year and really enjoyed it so we wanted to check out Copa by sea since we love seafood.  I made reservations about a month ago and upon arriving we were shown to our table.  It wasn't packed at 6pm but was filling up quite quick.  
We were seated at one of the tables along the edge.  Great privacy and ambiance (but I found it to be a bit echo-y!).  The major difference between Copa by Sea and Copa Cabana is that the server will bring you items from the seafood bar (including the sides as well).  Our server was a bit slow to bring all of the seafood bar items.  We had the lobster mac and cheese (very good), grilled calamari (very good) and shrimps (they were huge!).  We skipped on the sides cuz we didn't want to fill up so soon.  We tried everything on the menu.  My favorites: bacon wrapped cod, black cod, scallops, fillet of branzino, buttermilk ribeye and the beef ribs.  There is a limit on the oyster (4 per person, we're actually not fans so we didn't order any), black cod and scallops (4 piece each person).  Overall, very enjoyable experience.  All the servers were friendly and attentive.  If you decline a piece, they immediately ask you if you want anything from the kitchen.  The manager/supervisor (someone senior) came by to check in on us during our meal to see if everything was good.  Again, very friendly atmosphere.  We were stuffed so we didn't try to dessert- grilled banana and pineapple.  We did try the pineapple last year and it was very delicious. Overall, the food wasn't that salty which is good.  $45 is a little expensive but a fun experience and a must-try if you like seafood.  Only downside of the meal was a really loud group of group around the bar.  A woman was screaming a few times which was a little annoying but again, can't really do anything about that.  
At the end of the meal, while we were paying, we were asked whether we would like to see them combining both menus.  Possibly, this is in the making and patrons in the future can have a taste of both meat and seafood in one meal?  Hopefully, the prices won't skyrocket!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday, and our reservation for 4 people at 7:30 pm. We did not get seated until an hour later which we did not know what was happening. No clear answers from the hostesses or apologizing for the wait. The manager for copa by sea did apologize to us after and acknowledged that they are working out the logistics. Because of the wait, we were offered to try the food from upstairs as well (Brazilian meats). I enjoyed the scallops and tuna sushi. Crab legs were great as well. Overall, I was expecting more food to come out like the regular Brazilian meats at a faster pace. The dining area is really small compared to upstairs where copacabana is."}
{"text":"$45 PER person gets you all you can eat of an ok selection of very high quality seafood and meat cooked perfectly Brazilian style I guess. Not sure if Brazilians eat this way but let's go along with it. 

Came here on a Saturday night with a reservation for 5:30pm. Walked downstairs into  loud music with an inviting, casual, lively atmosphere. Were given great seats - a round bench looking onto the kitchen. We were greeted by a great number of  attentive staff. Not once did we run out of anything since people were coming around constantly checking in with us but not in an annoying way. Probably harder for them to deliver this kind of attention and service when it gets busier. 

We were offered every item on the menu more than once. The food tasted great  however the only issue was a lack of anything green or vegetables - for the record, I don't care but some you may want some lighter vegetable side dishes. Unlike the sister restaurant Copacabana that has a salad bar this restaurant does not have a salad bar. Every item on the menu needs to be ordered or is served table side. 

Definitely a great restaurant and will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday. I have to say,  although the place have good service, I wasn't that impressed with this place. I think it was over priced, very cramped, and the food was very, very salty. It was $45 per person before taxes and gratuity. for an all you can eat style place,  the menu selection was small. The items that they grill were good but way too salty. For instance, the black cod was cooked perfectly but it was so salty I just couldn't eat it. The salmon that they cooked was over cooked.  Overall, tje food quality was only satisfactory."}
{"text":"For the price we paid, you can't go wrong for a place that's part of the Copa company/brand. The dining area is in the downstairs of the Copa Cabana, and it is very small. You will get the option to order food off the menu also wait for the servers to come by with different food selections. There is a mix of meat and seafood options which is good variety, also there is a seafood bar but it only had cheesy bread, salmon with capers, and cold shrimp. I have to note that I really liked the shrimps, even though I never go for them at other buffets-they were good here. You get 4 oysters per guest afterwards it is $1 each, I felt they were alright. I've had better ones with more flavour. The sushi was good, they weren't overdosed with rice and were very crunchy which was good. Often the tempura gets soggy, but they don't use the traditional panko breading for their tempura shrimps in their rolls. The menu food came in very small portions so make sure you order more if you really liked it. Our server seemed to forget some of our orders, due to not writing down the orders. I would prefer if they wrote things down because it's hard to remember, I'm not sure why they don't get them to beats me. For certain meat options, they seemed to be quite salty or dry so make sure you taste test. The bellini cocktail I got was very good and strong. The desserts were their signature grilled pineapple and banana. I wish they gave a scoop of ice cream to go along with the fruit, the banana was not quite ripe so it tasted okay. 

More options at the seafood bar and more dessert options would really be great. Also give your servers something to take down peoples orders so they don't forget. Our server seemed to disappear when we wanted to make an order or when we reminded her about our forgotten order, it remained forgotten even after we brought it to her attention. Overall, would come back but I probably stick to the regular Copa upstairs. This was a good place to try, not mind blowing."}
{"text":"They ran out of all the seafood except the shrimp and salmon. Would not recommend this place as there may be no seafood available when you arrive. Servers were very disrespectful and did not know how to compensate for this. We were given access to the meat selection but that was not what we were looking for. When asking server questions, we would get an \"I dunno\" as an answer.

The food was extremely salty as well. We checked in using Yelp, however everyone has to show individually that they checked in to receive the discount. We were not aware of this and this was not in the terms of the coupon. 

Overall horrible experience, I am warning everyone to never visit this place."}
{"text":"Came here on my birthday because we wanted to have seafood. 

Came into the restaurant and right when we order they told us they have NOTHING left other than salmon and bacon wrapped cod. 

WOW. Seriously? They call themselves a seafood restaurant eh. Words can't even describe how disappointed we are.

DO NOT COME. Avoid if possible."}
{"text":"All-you-can-eat seafood in downtown Toronto for $35?! That's practically unheard of! Copa By Sea is the newest creation under the Copa brand. It's actually located just downstairs from the famous Copacabana Brazilian Steakhouse. 

Here are some of my favourite menu items:
- Raw bar: tuna ceviche, branzino crudo, and salmon carpaccio are my favourites. They are only one-bite size, but the flavour of each one is very intense and unique.
- Sides: soba noodle salad is cold and refreshing. Lobster & shrimp mac n' cheese is good also. I would recommend to have one of each, as these are somewhat carb heavy items.
- Rodizio: black cod, umadashi scallops, buttermilk ribeye, and beef ribs are my favourite. The beef ribs is the most tender ones I've ever eaten.

For Rodizio items, there are waiters who will bring each kind of Rodizio item around to your table on a skewer frequently, so you don't have to order them separately. They are very friendly and will usually serve the food to you, unless you explicitly tell them to stop (I tried to cover my plate with my hands so they got the hint. =D). For everything else, you have to order them separately with the waitress. Some of the items do have quantity limits per person, including oysters, black cod, and scallops. Other than those, you can eat as much as you want.

For the high quality of seafood and the great customer service, I would say that this place is definitely a must-try if you are a seafood lover like me."}
{"text":"My cousins and mom were visiting from out of town. It was a party of 8. We waiting for our reserved table 45 min :( . The service after that was good and the food was delicious!!! The only dish I didn't like was the meat with Parmesan. It was way too salty for my liking. I loved the oysters, sushi, shrimp and desserts. We pigged out and everyone loved it! I wish we hadn't waited for too long, otherwise they would have gotten 4 stars."}
{"text":"Theoretically, an all-you-can-eat seafood buffet conveniently located in downtown Toronto sounds like a godsend, but unfortunately this restaurant leaves much to be desired.

THE GOOD:
- oysters and mignonette sauce were delicious
- grilled black cod
- salmon carpaccio
- ribeye steak

THE BAD:
- you have to sit in a dark, freezing cold basement of the restaurant 
- most of the food is only \"okay\" - the cocktail shrimp come with the shell on, and are served with seafood sauce that is lacking in horseradish flavour; the crab legs are tasteless; the grilled items are COATED with salt; the sushi is mediocre at best
- the black cod, which is limited to 4 pieces per person, didn't come around for the first hour that we were seated and we had to request it

They have also increased their prices so it costs $50 on a weekend. Overall, it was fine, but I don't think I'd go back. You may be better off spending the same amount on a seafood platter elsewhere."}
{"text":"Copa by Sea is definitely a great experience, the food was good and the service was excellent.

When we first arrived, they got us started on a piece of almost every item on the menu. We enjoyed almost everything except for one of the fishes (I think it was the cod) because it was waaaay too salty. The sushi and lobster mac and cheese were nothing really special, and they were super filling so I would avoid eating too much of that if you want to eat more seafood.
I think my favourites were the garlic shrimp, teriyaki salmon, the branzino, and the bananas. My friends really enjoyed the ribeye steak and scallops, too. 

They seemed to have many accidents with the grill while we were there. They messed up the scallops, shrimp, the pineapples, oh man. However, every time it happened they told us that we would have to wait a tiny bit longer while they get a new batch on the grill, which was totally fine. They also ran out of sweet potato fries and brought us fish dumplings instead. Protip: do not eat the fish dumplings.

Again, it was a great experience and I definitely want to try Copacabana too, eventually. But for $45 plus tax and tip per person, I don't think I will be visiting again any time soon, no matter how good those pineapples and bananas are."}
{"text":"reservation for 7:30 pm for 2 ... Still don't have the table by 8:00.  Many people walked in after us and got served before us ... can't imagine how good the service/food is once I sit down"}
{"text":"The food is just OK. Nothing special comparing to the Brazilian copa upstairs. The service is horrible. We waited and waited and waited. The servers just don't seem to come to our table. It took us 2.5 hours to finish the meal with a lot of staring at phones and waiting for food. The second round of our order didn't come until half an hour later. In the end we mentioned to our server that we think the wait is too long and she acted surprised. I mean, come on. We checked in on yelp and used the 10% off, even that it is not worth the price at all."}
{"text":"Should of took the other reviews seriously. 

Was super excited to visit copa by the sea after going to the copacabana on Eglinton. AYCE seafood sounded so good... Until we realized it's basically an AYCE sushi place. Except not as much selection. Or fish. But definitely a lot more salt. 

It wasn't all bad, the service was actually pretty good! Our server was attentive and tried her best to serve all the table sit seemed.

However, unlike the regular copa who has servers circling around, copa by the sea felt like they were circling a server once an hour. 

The food was decent, however for the amount we paid, we definitely could of gotten a much better AYCE (KaKa) and end the night off with drinks. 

Overall, I don't think I'll be coming here any time soon. I'm still a bit too salty about the food."}
{"text":"I made reservations on my tablet.  Love the updated email responses.  This is the first time eating at this restaurant.  I went here to celebrate  my birthday.  I had to wait a while for our table, but the wait was pleasurable.  We spoke to others waiting on a comfy sofa.  Took this time to take pics as well.  The service was good and the food was great!  A couple salty  items, but overall very good food.  The one thing I didn't like, was the floor!  I was wearing  heels, and it was very slippery.  I almost fell the first time.  I advise the ladies to wear a wedge heel or flats."}
{"text":"Just like Copacabana Brazilian Steakhouse, they had a self serve bar consisting of crab legs, shrimp and other sides which you can enjoy before the Rodizio service. They had an a la carte menu that included ceviche, sushi and oysters which were great shareable items. From the Rodizio, I enjoyed the garlic shrimp, umadashi scallops, teriyaki salmon and buttermilk ribeye (a bit salty though). There were several items that I didn't try only because the servers didn't come around with them at the beginning, and when they did, I was already too full to eat more. From their signature sides, the lobster and shrimp mac n cheese was very rich and delicious, a popular dish among the foodies that night. By the end of our meal I was stuffed but I was still saving room for the grilled pineapple that was served for dessert along with fried bananas. The grilled pineapple was a mix between sweet and sour which was simply delicious."}
{"text":"Went there for a friend's birthday. We were seated 45 min late with the only explanation that every table seated 1 hr late that night. It was so loud I could only talk to the person next to me. There was no space for the waiters to move around, everything was so jam packed. It was a disappointing experience. Food was ok."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with my visit here! I am a huge seafood fan, and went to Copa by the Sea for dinner with a large group. We were treated very well. Servers were attentive, and most importantly, the food was amazing. The flavours were rich albeit a bit on the salty side, and the timing was perfect (especially for the scallops). I liked that chefs personally came out to serve the food and interact with guests. My favourites were the grilled shrimp, black cod, grilled pineapple. The decor was very modern and casual. I noticed that the volume on the upper floor (Copacabana Steakhouse) was fuller; I assume this was because the seafood prices were higher. But rest reassured, seafood was definitely worth it.

Copa by the Sea was a great restaurant, but there were a few cons here and there. One thing that I was a bit disappointed about was the limit for the foods. Oysters, black cod, and a few other items weren't all-you-can-eat. And they were delicious. Also, the cooking times weren't slow but it wasn't quick either; considering the time limit, you may want to order quickly."}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent. There were a couple of strange items on the menu, but being a buffet it didn't make a difference in cost so we tried it all anyways!
It was a different experience as there were only a few items that you ordered off the menu. The rest was brought on skewers by servers, so you had to sit eagerly and hope they'd bring something good to your table.
We were a bit disappointed because even though the servers approached us a couple of times to inquire what we wanted more of or what we haven't tried yet, there were a few items that never came to our table by the time we finished our meal. 
If you have the Toronto key to the city, you can use it here! Free cocktail. That was nice to have (:
Overall the experience was good. I'm indifferent as to whether I'd go back again, though."}
{"text":"Overall the experience was ok. Considering it was a special night I feel everything was very disorganized. I brought 20 people in and when we arrived at 8 our server didn't bring our drinks until 8:30. She may have been one of the worst servers I've ever had. I had to ask her 4 times if our drinks were coming and we watched as they sat up on the bar. Finally I asked the manager if she could get them. The drinks were outrageously overpriced.... 14 dollars for a Burt Reynolds shot? You have to be kidding me. Our friends ordered a shot of what they thought was cold Sake but they brought out a cup of it and charged us 25 dollars for it. It was unacceptable. I really wanted to like this place. The food was good but the service for what you're paying is atrocious. I'm not sure I would come back."}
{"text":"3.5/5 stars

I made reservations for the three of us for Sunday evening the weekend before. We arrived at the restaurant about 30 mins early but were seated right away. When we arrived it was quite empty and there was only one table occupied. Service was very attentive and perfect. Since there weren't many people there we felt like royalty. Food came out hot and fast. We all enjoyed 90% of the items that came out. Some were a bit salty so we didn't order it for the second round. The sushi was made to the perfect size because they weren't too big like many sushi restaurants.

During the middle of dinner was when me and my boyfriend started to get a stomachache. Something we ate during dinner didn't sit well which made us use the washroom on several occasions. I told the manager about the situation because some of the items weren't fully cooked (ie. scallops, salmon). I wasn't expecting a free meal or discount but some sympathy or kitchen check would've been helpful. She even cringed when I told her I had to use the washroom. She wasn't sympathetic at all or ask how we felt afterwards. Around 7 pm was when more tables got filled up. This was when we all noticed the service dropping and the wait for food took longer. My sister ordered the dynamite roll but it never got to our table. The server looking after us became less pleasant. The manager ruined the whole dining experience when she came to hand us our bills. She didn't make small talk at all or looked like she wanted to be friendly. She didn't ask how our meals were or if we felt better. She handed us our receipts and muttered \"have a nice day\" just because she has to. Copacabana needs a manager that can do more than just manage their team. They should know how to provide great customer service. However, she didn't even come close to even good.

Copa By Sea is an expensive restaurant which is good for special occasions. But the service from the manager just turned me off big time.

Tip: Check in and use the 10% off voucher"}
{"text":"I was not happy with the service here. The food was a little salty, but not terrible. The black cod and scallops were the best things on the menu. 

The service was very slow. I had to frantically wave to a waitress or waiter before they ignored me to go help another guest. There was some awkwardness between our first waitress and I, because I guess I asked too many questions about the menu and how the ordering works. I can see the look of annoyance on her face as she walked back to the bar. 

A few minutes later, another waitress comes by to tell us she is our new waiter. I had no idea why, because the previous waiter was servicing the table next to us. It looked as though she didn't want to deal with the \"Asian\" table. Anyhow, I was glad to have our new waitress. She was pleasant and all the other male staff were friendly."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best seafood AYCE! All rodizio items were seasoned perfectly except for the shrimp which was salty for me. The Ceviche helped neutralize the saltiness though. Even their sushi is amazing! I didn't get to try the entire menu but I would definitely comeback for more. Service was really quick and attentive as well. I would have given the place a 5 star if only they had veggies. They had NONE."}
{"text":"Had dinner earlier tonight with a group of 10 friends. In general food was good but it seem like we ate more sides than mains. Food took long to prepare and a few items never made it to our table. We were never given fresh shrimp cocktails or king crab legs!! It's not seafood if all we get is fish and no crab- very misleading.  Black cod was great. Very limited dessert. just a meh"}
{"text":"Was super excited about this reservation Saturday, my bf and I love seafood. We will not be coming back. This was the coldest day of the year...it was just as cold inside. They had absolutely no heat. And just reading the post below me, even though it was A LOT warmer the following day it was just as cold inside as per the reviewer below, so this wasn't just a one time thing. I appreciated the fact the did move us move the window seat to the back. Honesty, it helped a little, only a little. I paid $50 per person to sit in the cold....the waiters were very nice. Felt like we were there to sample everything. everything tastes good. The shrimp was the best. they charged me 3.50 for a tea bag and some hot water. Menu is very small, we have had AYCE seafood in other places which were SOOOO much better. We will not be back."}
{"text":"*Ignore the previous negative review about the restaurant layout. If you're going to make large reservations at a restaurant, do your research and know what you are booking for. Copa by the Sea is a seperate section located at the bottom level of the restaurant. The upper 2 levels are the Copacabana steakhouse levels; samba shows/music and entertainment take place here on Fridays/Saturdays. If you are looking for a more lively experience, go with Copacabana.

If you are a seafood lover, you will LOVE copa by the sea. The fish here is to die for. There are a few meat options (which are also very good) but menu is mainly seafood. We arrived around 5 pm on a Friday, no reservations and were seated right away. The restaurant was empty and we were greeted by multiple staff who repeated the same information on how the ordering works (but not a big deal). Food came out fast, servers were very friendly. My favourites were teriyaki salmon (best i've ever had), bacon wrapped cod (soft and flakey), branzino (buttery goodness), and the scallops (soo good). Cold dishes (crab legs, shrimp, oysters) were also very delicious. The only mediocre dishes were the sushi rolls and the lobster mac'n'cheese, they were average/nothing special. All in all, the experience was very nice. 1 star off only because of the steep price! $50 + tax&tip per person on fridays/saturdays, $45 on weds/thurs/sun. Would recommend it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here but left a bit disappointed.

No access to the cold seafood, you need to ask the waiter/waitress to get it for you but it takes forever or it never comes.  For the price you're paying would have been nice to get access to the salad bar upstairs.

Cooked fish was excellent, black cod was amazing, only get 4 pieces though, small pieces.

Snow crab was so terrible, it had absolutely no flavor whatsoever, that I couldn't even finish it.

Servers were nice but never brought me my stuff!!!  Now they've increased the price, definitely won't be going back.  Actually even if they didn't I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Seafood lovers can rejoice thanks to the new rodizio-style restaurant that has opened up in the heart of Toronto. Copa by Sea is situated below the popular Copacabana at Adelaide and Duncan Street and is featuring a $30 (limited time price) all-you-can-eat seafood menu.

I had the chance to visit Copa by Sea a few weeks ago for a Zomato Meetup and ended up trying almost every item from the menu which left me in a satisfying yet lethargic state. #itwasworthit

The restaurant was very lively and the open-concept kitchen/grill allows you to view the bartenders shaking up various cocktails and the chefs preparing food over charcoal flames.

I started with a variety of items (crab legs, shrimp, smoked salmon) which were spread out along the counter near the kitchen for easy to grab appetizers before the table-side items were served.

The first a la carte items that came to our table were an assortment of sushi such as dynamite rolls, spicy tuna, spicy salmon, fresh P.E.I. Oysters and tuna ceviche. I really enjoyed the sushi and oysters but the ceviche was a little too sour/watery for my liking.

Next up were the grilled items that were brought to the table and served off of skewers.  The items came to our table sporadically so that you weren't overwhelmed with everything all at once. We were served with one or two pieces of the item to start with and was able to order more of the items that we really enjoyed throughout the night. The items were: Garlic Shrimp, Mahi Mahi Tandoori, Passion Fruit Salmon, Teriyaki Salmon, Black Cod, Bacon Wrapped Cod, Fillet of Branzino, Umadashi Scallops, Peanut Butter Chicken, Buttermilk Ribeye, Beef Ribs. The sides were: Fried Calamari, Lobster and Shrimp Mac n Cheese, Onion Rings, Fries.

The food taste and quality definitely exceeded my expectations.  I figured that an all-you-can-eat seafood place might have a variety of subpar food but DAMN I was wrong, everything was extremely tasty!  All of the food was cooked to perfection which is super important when it comes to seafood.  There is nothing worse than overcooked shrimp or salmon.  The seafood was also seasoned perfectly and none of the flavours were overpowering.  The highlights for me was the garlic shrimp, scallops, black cod and beef ribs.  The least favourite items were the peanut butter chicken which didn't really suit the menu in the first place and the passion fruit salmon.  The chunks of salmon were actually cooked perfectly but I didn't really care for the passion fruit sauce, however the teriyaki version was excellent.

For dessert we were served fried bananas drizzled in chocolate and dusted with cinnamon and gilled pineapple. The pineapples are usually a favourite of mine but I like them grilled a lot more so that the sugars start to caramelize, these one were a bit under-grilled.  The bananas were quite good but I will so full at this point that I only had a small bite. Both tasty though and I appreciate fruit for dessert.

Overall I was impressed by the food at Copa by Sea and I highly recommended you checking it out especially with the limited time pricing of 30 dollars per person.  This is such a great deal for the amount of delicious seafood you'll be eating. Thank you to Zomato and Copa by Sea for a wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"Officially one of my favourite restaurants in the GTA!
I've been hearing so much about Copa Cabana, but not being such a huge meat eater I never considered giving it a shot, especially once hearing about the price per person. Then I was told that they offer a special birthday deal, so I went online to also come across Copa By Sea. The thought of an AYCE grilled seafood for my birthday was something I had to try.
Unfortunately, I couldn't get a party of 4, which meant I could not receive the birthday free meal. This didn't stop me.
Upon entering, I was immediately taken downstairs, which was Copa By Sea, while upstairs was Copa Cabana. 
The decor was pretty upscale, classy, and intimate. Their concept was that you choose from a selection of unlimited 4 to 5 appetizers, ngiri sushi, maki sushi, and one serving of oysters. We ordered the oysters (obviously), lobster mac n' cheese (heaven!), some sort of salad (meh), the eel ngiri sushi (omg...melted in my mouth!), rainbow roll, and black dragon roll. The sushi were made really well. 
     The actual AYCE grilled fish option had like 7-10 different fish options, and their goal was to serve all of them at least once. 
They all were exceptional!! My personal favourites were the cod and some spicy sauce fish (forgot the name). They also had one meat option (ribeye), which I did not try.
I loved every bit of it, including the dessert, which was grilled cinnamon sugar pineapples and grilled bananas with chocolate sauce. These were perfect as they were not too heavy. I was definitely over-eating and couldn't stop ordering. 
I also noticed that they gave birthday customers a special dessert consisting of cake pops and some sorta mousse. But since I was too stuffed, I didn't mention my birthday. 
The only thing I didn't enjoy was that when all the options were served once, they wouldn't come to your table again, unless you call them out. So to get another serving was a pain...or a blessing in disguise.
Since it was a Sunday the price was $5 cheaper. But I feel like you get your moneys worth for sure! Reservation is definitely recommended.
I crave for this all the time now and wont wait for an occasion to visit again."}
{"text":"This has been far the most disappointing meal of my 3 week trip in Toronto, rivalling even instant ramen. Having been a long time fan and advocate of copacabana, I was hoping for a measly equivalent as that would be expected. 

However Copa by Sea has continued to disappoint dish after dish. Each dish was extremely salty and of poor quality. Service and food are extremely slow and menu items are magically disappearing and not revealed until you sit down. 

The best dishes are strangely the grilled pineapple and the ribeye. 

I'm afraid that Copa by Sea will soon be \"drowning\" in a sea of negative reviews. Hopefully, management will take these reviews seriously, and change for the better. 

I won't be coming back to pay $45 for such a lacklustre meal."}
{"text":"Great friendly service, nice decor, food was tasty with good size.  You will get really full by 5th or 6th course so best eat slowly and enjoy one piece at the time... Lol however little disappointed that they didn't have snow crab legs or cold dishes but definitely coming back again!"}
