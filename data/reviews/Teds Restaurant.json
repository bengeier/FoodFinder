{"text":"the service was bad, the food worse...I was very disappointed.  order the spagetti and came with a salad of iceberg lettuce, not very exciting...the waitress forgot to bring the roll, I had to ask for it. The roll then arrived without butter and it had been microwaved to the point of cotton candy consistency. The spagetti sauce had been thinned out with water and was runny and without any flavour whatsoever. The place was unreal. There wasn't any dessert at all....we were told the \"owner's mother makes the desserts and she's on vacation, so therefore...no dessert! I think Ted's is on it's way out, unless by some miracle they figure out how to run a restaurant."}
{"text":"Four stars for being a charming little diner very close to my home, and serving up a delicious, competitively priced breakfast. Five stars for starring in Orphan Black, one of my favourite TV shows, season 3 episode 1."}
{"text":"Started going here 25 years ago as a kid. Moved back to the area two years ago and still one of the best breakfast joints around."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place: the food is tasty and cheap, the service is awesome and the decor takes you back in time. And I've yet to stand in line for brunch on the weekend..."}
{"text":"Great local greasy spoon diner.  The breakfast is perfect.  The combo breakfast is great for variety and very satisfying for meat lovers.  Big portions.  Home made burgers, best chopped steak and eggs around.  Definitely one of our favourite places to get breakfast.  Long line up's on the weekends but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Some great food as well as great portions . All day breakfast is one of the best in Scarborough. Would be a 5/5 if not for the odd problem with servers here."}
{"text":"So you wake up on a Sunday morning, slightly hungover and/or bruised and you say..... I want to go to the 1950s in a far away corner of Toronto (sorry to those that live at the corner of Kingston Rd and Old Kingston Rd).  Then you look at your alarm clock and realize it is 1045am.  Better hustle because the menu has 2 price columns - before 11am and after!  Strangely, every item is $1 more at 11.  Why not simply add a footnote saying add $1 after 11... guess things were not so simple in the 50s.  The menu items are truck stop breakfast staples - no fancy pancakes or egg white creations - just simple moderately tasty grease.  Same goes for the coffee - just simple store brand drip.  Service is friendly.  Painted on the wall in the parking lot is \"Amazing Ted's\". Yes it is amazing from a historical perspective - right down to the decades old plates, framed photos and chairs.  I don't think \"Amazing\" was intended for the food."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast food with amazing prices! Service is excellent. I recommend the  Breakfast combo. Lots of food including bacon, eggs, toast, ham, sausage, peameal, and home fries. Restaurant has an old school feel that is unique and fun. Check it out when you're in the area! :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome in a greasy spoon 70's kinda way. I met some buddies here for breakfast on an early Saturday morning. Hint: The service is way better before the crowd arrives around 9:00. As noted, the decor is throw back and the booths were built to accommodate slimmer North American of the past. Looking past that, service was prompt and super friendly. All the meals come in one size: Extra Large. So come suitable hungry. Everyone in our small group was happy with their choices. This is comfort food. I would recommend with all the above caveats."}
{"text":"Ted's has been around for years. I can remember having Sunday breakfast there as a very young child and the place is so good that we go whenever I visit my parents, even though they live miles away now.    The restaurant could do with some loving refurbishment both inside and outside, but don't let the tatty appearance put you off. The restaurant is fantastic for breakfast - the french toast is great and the peameal bacon is fantastic. It's good food and really cheap.    The service is very friendly and attentive too. Your coffee cup is re-filled almost as soon as you've finished the previous cup."}
{"text":"I've lived here for almost 20 years and I've never been here until today. My friend's mom is one of the waitresses and she is the nicest lady. It was still fairly busy for a Monday early afternoon but we managed to get a booth. I had a vanilla milkshake and it is one of the best ones I've ever had in my life. Perfect consistency and not too sweet. I got the grilled cheese with fries and gravy. It wasn't anything out of the ordinary but still tasted great. My friend got the cheeseburger which is freshly made. It is very messy to eat but yummy and filling. The ladies here are great and are constantly walking around with coffee. There isn't much parking in the front but there is in the back and at several different plazas around the area. I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast with a group of friends who love the place. The restaurant has a family-style appeal, and you feel really comfortable when you're there, which I loved.  To the food, I loved it. I got their breakfast combo which is hands down the best deal I've yet to find for a classic breakfast. It was approximately $12 (tax included) for sausages, bacon, ham, peameal bacon, hash browns, 3 eggs, and 3 slices of toast. That was not a typo; $12 bucks my friends.  All that being said, it's hard to mess up breakfast food. If we were simply talking about the food, they would have gotten a 3 star since it was nothing all that special. Still really good though!"}
{"text":"This diner is a classic in the area. We love it for its no-frills and quick to order entrees. Great for brunch and love their portion sizes. Their 222 and breakfast specials are the best!"}
{"text":"How does a diner like Ted's get a 4 star rating? By delivering solid value for the money and providing the quintessential diner food you go here for. My kids love the breakfasts here, and when you can get some really good peameal and eggs with homefires and toast for 5.99, it's kinda hard to go wrong. They have the variations on hungry man breakfasts as well, and food always arrives fast and just how you ordered it. Yeah, they have lunch and dinner items as well, and again it is straightforward old time diner fare, no muss, no fuss, no exorbitant pricing. Would I drive across the city to go to Ted's? No. But if I am in the neighbourhood and need a hole filled, this is high on the list. Bring your appetite and check your pretensions at the door."}
{"text":"If you have watched A Handmaiden's Tale on TV then you will have see Ted's in a few of the scenes.   This is an old fashioned dinner. The menu is simple and they serve breakfast/brunch.  I will admit I found the booths rather cramped.  Better to get a table if you like more spacious dining.   I had their special.  3 eggs, toast, bacon, home fries and ham.  The meal arrived fast although the ban was cool to the touch.  The rest of the meal was fine.  The coffee was ok but this is diner food.   Depending on when you go to Ted's parking can be tight.  However there is a mall across the road with ample parking.    Brunch with the daughter who had bacon, home fries and toast cans to $22 for both of us so it is a tad more than Brunch at Eggspectations."}
{"text":"Teds is a great neighborhood diner.  This place is packed on Saturday/Sunday  mornings with u of t students and local families.  I love how diverse the patrons are, every color and and ethnicity that lives in the neighborhood goes to Teds.   My sister swears by the liver burger and I love the breakfast.  What it lacks in fresh ingredients, it makes up for it in charm and friendliness."}
{"text":"I was here on a Monday morning for breakfast. It was my first time here with my boyfriend. The menu is small and simple. This place has old but rustic feel being around for a longtime. I loved the bacon wall art lol. Reasonable prices having big portions. Seat yourself. I had the French toast and two eggs with a side of bacon.  It was good. My boyfriend had the breakfast sampler which came with sausage, bacon, pea meal bacon, ham, 3 eggs, and toast. Talk about a lot of meat!!"}
{"text":"We had not eaten here in over a decade. It use to be not bad. This time it was deplorable. I had the big breakfast. Silly me. Asked for very soft poached eggs. Now. Let me say this. If the guy in the kitchen can't poach an egg, please tell the customer!  Putting an egg in a muffin cup is not poached and if the yolk is set in any way it is not \"very soft\".   Usually my dh get better meals than me but not this time. He ordered the omelette. It was so badly over cooked that for the first time, he left food on his plate. Seriously. This man will eat anything. Except Teds Eggs. Ugh. Never again."}
{"text":"Ahhh, went here for breakfast/lunch and it was very good.  I got the special combo something that came with three eggs, toast, two bacon strips, two sausages, two pea meal, one ham, three tomatoes and potatoes YUM!  Food: 4/5, a perfect breakfast diner taste.  Nothing to complain here.  Service: 3/5, normal service, diner style  Ambiance: 3/5, very home-y, suburban feel where people of the neighbourhood gather on weekends to eat.    Price: 4/5, very good at around $15 for all that food."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and enjoyed the old fashioned feel of this place. It's like eating in a casual family restaurant back in the 60s.  Many of the restaurant's menu items and prices are posted on the walls. A bit of a casual dining time machine with reasonable prices.  The food is traditional burgers, burger sandwiches etc...along with a number of breakfast offerings. The portions are large and tasty.  Worth the drive in from Pickering."}
{"text":"Ted's has been around for over 50 years.  The atmosphere is very much 50 years old which I totally appreciate.  Many menu items and prices are posted on the walls.  The waitresses are truly friendly but not imposing.  If you have breakfast, the food on your plate is filling and you don't leave anything behind as it is all so tasty. Overall....great place."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to teds. Went there on a Saturday morning. Very busy but the line up moves quickly. Here you seat yourself when a table is available. Walking into teds gives you this nostalgic feel.  The servers were very pleasant and genuinely friendly.   Had the 222 special with 2 pancakes, 2 eggs (any style) and ham ( choice of ham, pea meal bacon, or bacon) my friend had the breakfast special which included ham, sausage, pea meal bacon and regular bacon, 3 eggs(any style) tomato, home fries and toast. The food was really good and the prices are reasonable. Definitely going back there."}
{"text":"The last few times I've been there it hasn't been so good.  Slow service, high prices for smaller servings, dirty/chipped dishes and the building feels like it's falling apart. None of this matters though, it's a nostalgia place so of you are here you are just looking for people that love it as much as you have since your parents took you here years ago."}
{"text":"Great place for a weekend brunch. It's true, it does get packed later on in the morning, and after 11 am, all items are $1 more. Even though we got there after 11, our  two hearty breakfasts with coffee came to under $20. Be prepared to stand in line and wait for a while to be seated."}
{"text":"We love TEDs.. Great food, great value  and awesome service."}
{"text":"My first time there and I had the big breakfast for $10 plus tax and tip. Three eggs, four meats, hashbrowns and toast. This breakfast was high-quality, fast and perfect! Usually with a big breakfast plate like that, something is lower quality like the home fries or over cooked bacon or something. Not at Ted's restaurant! I know the parking can be a little tight but service is fast and friendly.  I can't wait to go back to try the rest of the menu, too bad it's not around the corner from where I live."}
{"text":"My cousin lives nearby and had recommended this place a few times so today seemed like a good time to try it. My friend, Jennifer K., and I arrived around 10:30am and it was pretty busy with a lot of breakfast diners.  We ordered from their all day breakfast menu, which had a large selection of omelettes, pancakes, French toast, eggs, and some combos. I had eggs with peameal bacon and she had just eggs. Both meals came with potatoes, toast, and coffee. The food was cooked well, the portions were very generous, and the prices were CHEAP!  The service was also very good. This is a great place for breakfast! Maybe I'll have to come back for lunch or dinner.  PS - The company was fantastic!"}
{"text":"We gave it a try! The service was great, food was delicious and perfect portion! And the price was so cheap! Very satisfied over all."}
{"text":"Ted's is an institution in the Highland creek area. I have been going to Ted's since before they switched ownerships and the food quality,the service and the atmosphere have always remained on point. great place for hearty breakfast food."}
{"text":"Perfect little place to get your weekly (or daily or semidaily) greasy intake of wholesome American bacon eggs breakfast. Love this little place. I would 5 stars if they filtered their water a little more or strengthened the coffee much more."}
{"text":"I like it. Been there once and had a good experience. Will definely go again. Love their pancakes, light and fluffy. For the price, it's great"}
{"text":"This place is more hype than substance. Looks cool and retro from the outside, but the retro musty smell of the dining room does not suit.  Food is fairly priced and is similarly fair in flavour, but not outstanding. Eggs were pretty standard, potatoes were cold, and the sausages were bland."}
{"text":"It wasn't half bad. Needs new furniture and cutlery...and plates... cups too... just needs a whole makeover! Service did come with a smile."}
{"text":"How have I not yet reviewed this gem?! Another amazing spot right in my neighbourhood (well...the neighbourhood of my youth-but-parents-still-live-there). It has not changed since the high school days of coming here for breakfast on the weekend with friends after a slumber party. Awesome breakfast specials and it really feels like you're walking into the past. Love the diner feel and the waitstaff are great.  By the cash there's a little bacon paraphernalia display and it's very cute. This classic place is a staple in the neighbourhood and loved by all who I bring here. It's a reason for me to come visit my parents more often. Gotta love that! haha. Well they gotta!"}
{"text":"Teds Restaurant is a real old school diner. I felt like I just took the time machine and went back 30 + years.   All Day Breakfast from $4.25 with 3 eggs, toast and home fries. Nothing fancy but good solid breakfast.  Service was fast and friendly.  If you are in the neighbourhood, it is worth checking it out."}
{"text":"Great little diner in the Scarborough/Port Union area - always a favourite breakfast hot spot for me and my friends.   Servers are friendly and attentive, they come around to refill your water and coffee at regular intervals and food arrives promptly. They are good about providing extra plates for sharing, as my friends and I usually split 2 of the 222 combos and a plate of home fries between the three of us. I would definitely recommend getting the french toast with the combo, since it is thick and much better than I've had at most other places. The home fries are fantastic, thick chunks of potato which are perfectly seasoned.   Never had to wait long for a table, although the place is usually pretty busy. Exiting the parking lot is a bit of a struggle due to the awkward turn though. Overall great breakfast food at an affordable price, and a cute, small-town diner ambiance!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't been here and it's near my area! So happy I decided to have breakfast here on Saturday morning. The food was amazing! I got the 222 combo and I got to choose what meat I wanted & if I wanted either French toast or pancakes, with eggs. It definitely filled me up, the portions are good and the food tastes amazing.  The service can definitely improve. I felt like it was really hard to get the waiter's attention to place the order or to even ask for stuff, such as straws, napkins, etc. Also, I understand that this diner has been open for decades now, but they should make some minor changes, such as the tables, seating area, etc."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very 1950s since it's been around since then! When we walked in, you can seat yourself. It wasn't busy but the waitresses didn't come to give us our menus for about 10 mins, so we went to grab some ourselves since they were talking to one another as soon as we came in.   The food is classic diner food and $, about $5-10 or a bit more for each breakfast food. I only had breakfast here! But they do have lunch and dinner here too. No website that I've found... so I attached menu photos! Limited parking in the front (less than 4 spots) but there's shops all around so you can park and walk! Service was a bit slow, but they were  nice. It wasn't busy, maybe 4-5 tables filled but it did take a long time to get small requests filled (hot sauce or water filled etc).   Only maybe a star for the great portions and really reasonable price. Food is decent tasting and filling, but nothing special, and not worth more than it's $12 price. Came with a friend to catch up so it's nice to hang out with some cheap breakfast food. If you're looking for a quick spot it does get busy later in the morning and menu prices are $1 more after 11am.  If you want classic breakfast, cheap, and quick, come here early! Or you'll find much better breakfast spots (even eggsmart or Cora's for more creative and tasty breakfast dishes for around $12).  Had a nice time but I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"My wife and I are regulars at Ted's.  We frequently have our Sunday breakfasts here.  It is basically a breakfast place and I wouldn't recommend going for lunch/dinner. The prices are great, the food is exactly what you expect from a greasy spoon and the servers are always quick and attentive."}
