{"text":"I held my wedding at the Madison Club over memorial day weekend and it was perfection! The staff handled every single thing from top to bottom and I truly had to worry about nothing! Chastity was my coordinator and she drew up very specific directions to make sure that the evening flowed and all of the changes in the rooms would be done smoothly.  Those directions were perfect and the staff knocked it out of the park!  Beyond that, the food and drink services were awesome!  The dinners we served for the reception not only looked gorgeous when they were set in front of guests but they also tasted amazing.  I know I might be biased, but it was BY FAR the best wedding food I've ever had! Others have said the same, including my mother, who is not easy to please....If you're looking for a place that can handle everything from the ceremony to the reception, you will be VERY happy if you choose the Madison Club!"}
{"text":"For years this place has provided high quality service and exceptional customer service.  Hard to beat! Food and service are excellent."}
{"text":"We were so well taken care of - dietary restrictions and all! What a wonderful experience. This was my first time at the Madison Club. Went with my husband and his coworkers before heading to the Overture Center for the Frostiball. Great way to kick off the formal evening. The atmosphere was beautiful. What I was most blown away by was the accommodations the chef and sous chef were willing to make for my current dietary restrictions. I contacted the restaurant ahead of time and they offered to create special courses that fit my current restrictive list of foods. That way I didn't have to feel singled out or demanding when ordering. I would certainly recommend this experience to anyone - with or without special dietary needs."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of fun at their special dining events. Great food. I've attended a wedding here, which was very nicely done."}
{"text":"The first time I ventured into the Madison Club was for SloPig 2013. As a result of housing an event where I found myself mowing down on salted caramel Sassy Cow ice cream with piggy-inspired toppings on a Sunday night, I'm officially a fan. By the way, clicking your sparkly red heels as you say \"lard funnel cake toppings\" will transport you no place but home. If you've yet to fork up the $100 a ticket for this event, give in to those pork fantasies and live...or bask in the glory of your elite Yelper friend who wins free tickets and invites you along.  6 chefs and 6 cocktail masters compete for the SloPig title in their respective categories while a number of other charcuterie, beer, condiment, cheese and seafood artisans dish out their best samplings throughout the tasting rooms. With this in mind, prepping for the night out meant I only allowed myself a serving of cottage cheese and a piece of toast before 6pm the day of. I actually intended to pick up a pizza afterwards because sample sizes...really? Looking back, I wouldn't have even eaten anything at all beforehand seeing as I found myself almost [gracefully] coma tucked into a corner of one of the space's very charming rooms an hour and a half in.   Chef Andrew Wilson of the Madison Club was one of the competitors with a menu that featured items like Country Ham and Miso Cured Vegetable Creme Brûlée, Schlitz Battered Pickled Porkbelly and Cheese Curds, Kobe Beef Tartare Tacos, Goat Brats and Bacon Baklava. The baklava was a bit dry but this really didn't stop me from getting seconds. The creme brûlée was a pleasant surprise with its salty, sweet and creamy goodness. Even though Wilson did not win the SloPig title, I found his menu to be one of the most adventurous with the way he transformed the pig, beef and goat portions he was given.  My one complaint about this locale would have to be the shallow stairs. Mixing these with irresponsible cocktail management WILL lead to an unintentional view of the beautiful light fixtures hanging from the ceiling. This became clear when a loud thud from a woman taking the trip downwards lead my friends and I to glance over the banister and make sympathy faces. Maybe I won't entirely blame the stairs though because, as my one friend commented in order to make the drunk tumbler feel better, \"gravity sucks\"."}
{"text":"My company hosted an employee celebration at the Madison Club yesterday. Wow, they did an excellent job! From the beginning, meeting with Chastity, to on sight execution with Martin, everyone was friendly, attentive, and caring. The team truly cared about our event success and went above and beyond the call of duty, being flexible with changes as they came up.   The venue was set perfectly. The food was excellent. My only recommendations would be to bread any fry the cheese curds in house (not the frozen and fried kind), and to put the mini grilled cheese on a skewer for those who don't like it dipped in the tomato soup. Although, I thought the tomato soup was creamy and delicious! People also commented that the mini sliders were not tough or dry, but juicy and grilled perfectly.   Thank you, Madison Club!"}
{"text":"The Madison Club is a Madison institution; historic, elegant, with a beautiful view from the dining room. It is a private, members-only Club, though routinely hosting \"investment,\" \"retirement planning\" and other seminars (once only held at the local Holiday Inn by traveling peddlers) have diluted its brand. Its Achilles heel, however, is the chronic inconsistency in service; mistakes in food orders, lukewarm dishes that should be served hot, and slow service are not uncommon occurrences. Pointing it out to management is generally an exercise in futility, because over several years the same issues have persisted; an indication of inadequate hiring, training, and supervision. I'm still a member, partly out of habit, partly because the parking is convenient, and partly out of hope that one day, within my natural lifetime, things might improve."}
{"text":"beautiful timeless facility---went there for a xmas party in december----worst steak i've ever had---tougher than buckskin, no flavor, and hard to get down---what a shame---that type of meat shouldn't even be on the menu"}
{"text":"We first heard of The Madison Club when we were on a tour of buildings in downtown Madison. While touring the Madison Club we were able to see the amazing view of Lake Monona from the dining room known as Churchill's Restaurant. We also visited the courtyard and lounge known as The Tap Room where we were able to peek at their menu. We learned that the Madison Club was members-only, but I was determined we would eat there. I got home and looked it up on-line expecting to sign-up for membership. Sticker shock over the price! I was not going to become a member and I was not going to be able to have dinner there.   Fast forward a few months and we are attending a charity auction. One of the items was a gift certificate for The Madison Club. I bid on it, won it, and we were on our way.  We finally got around to using it this summer on a Monday evening. I called and made reservations. The atmosphere is old school elegance. Very formal and reserved. There were only two tables with patrons. We were sat at the window overlooking the lake. Perfect!  Our uniformed waiter arrived and asked what he could do for us. He was polite and formal. We asked for a drink menu which he promptly brought. We ordered drinks and when they arrived they were sensational. The were also quite reasonable considering the prices on the rest of the dinner menu. There was a little awkwardness and we wondered if he would be bringing us food menus but he walked us through it and let us know when we were ready for them he would bring them. I definitely was feeling under sophisticated and mildly out-of-place.  After we ordered they brought us an amuse-bouche. It was amazing and probably my favorite part of the evening. One spoonful and packed w/flavors. Peach, bacon, herbs, it was the perfect bite. My Caesar salad had Parmesan crisps and real anchovies. Our entrees which were fish and pork-loin were amazing dishes. Drizzles of delectable sauce, perfectly cooked proteins. Appealing to both the tongue and the eye. None of the portions were huge and the prices were high, but we left feeling full and satisfied.  I'm thrilled I had the opportunity to try the Madison Club. The view, the service, and the food all lived up to my expectations. The price alone would make the the Madison Club a special event for me, but the membership requirement makes me feel lucky I was able to try it at all."}
{"text":"We had our wedding reception at The Madison Club this August, and overall were very pleased with our experience.  The service staff is very good - attentive and professional.  We were in the Louise Marston room for the cocktail hour and dancing and the adjacent dining room for dinner.  The Louise Marston room is beautiful.  Periwinkle blue walls with elegant crown molding and crystal chandeliers that make the whole room sparkle.  If you are looking to host an event, this room is lovely.  I did rent chivari chairs and would recommend that to give an updated fresh look to the dining room - their chairs are fine, just nothing special.  Only bummer was that the steak we had at the tasting was a completely different cut than the night of our wedding.  (the steak the night of the reception was much more sinewy and a tad overdone)  I realize it is challenging with high numbers, but I was hoping it would have at least been the same type of cut.  Other than that, this club is a well oiled machine and aims to please.  And the bathrooms are gorgeous!  Favorite one is on first floor, but the second floor is pretty too.  If you are lucky enough to have friends who are members, hint at an invite!"}
{"text":"My daughter was married at the Madison Club and also had her reception and dance there. The staff was excellent."}
{"text":"I attended a conference dinner party here, thus didn't have a choice of the food eaten. It wasn't necessarily what did I would have ordered, but it was high quality and tasty.    Appetizers were various salted hams and salamis with pickled veggies, mustards and small slices of toasted French bread.  We also had a calamari type salad, almost like a three bean salad but with calamari in it.  It was tasty, but not how I usually like to eat my octopus, this was almost like a cole-slaw, in a vinegarette. I prefer my calamari breaded and deep fried!    Main course was lamb chops along w shredded lamb with a side of mashed potatoes.  I am not a huge lamb fan, but the chop and the shredded meat were actually very good.  For dessert we had a cannoli and some tiramisu.  Both were ok, not great.  My favorite part was actually the rolls and butter.  There was a nice variety of freshly baked rolls from classic French bread to panini rolls w parmesan crust. The rolls were perfectly crusty on the outside and soft on the inside.  I could eat rolls and butter like this all day!  Again, not what I would have ordered, but very high quality food. If I had my choice, I am sure the food would have been excellent!  Nice atmosphere and excellent attentive service."}
{"text":"I came here for a wedding reception a few weekends ago and had a good time.  The venue is elegant and classy with nods to it's long history in Madison.  With that being said, I didn't care for the location of the Tap Room and dance floor being located in a lower level. In addition, we had around 150 people and were placed in two joining dining rooms with doors propped open in the middle.  The people in the back room had obstructed view of the front because of the walls.  As a result, some of us had to stand up and congregate near the doorway to see.  The food was decent but nothing to write home about.  The spring salad with radishes was very light and refreshing.  I had fish with sautéed spinach and farro, which was quite delicious!  Shortly after reception, we were informed to make our way to the lower level.  In fact, they were pretty adamant about clearing out the space that they made a few announcements.  It was quite unusual to be rushed out of a dining room like that given the nature of the event and that people were still catching up with friends that they haven't see in a while. Despite this incidence, we went down to the dance floor and enjoyed the rest of the night!   I certainly liked the historical charm of the Madison Club and its intimate venues. The service was excellent and the staff was all very professional!  However, the separate locations for reception, drinks and dance floor is not ideal for large weddings."}
{"text":"In my experience there with others, based on ambiance and food, not a place where I want to be. Older decor, pretentious yet grungy.  Not much for menu choices. Not welcoming to new people."}
{"text":"I agree with everyone that eating outside here with the view is excellent. After dark there is no light out there and we couldn't see what we were eating. Service is excellent.   The food was just ok. The fish fry on Friday night is of all things Rainbow Trout! I have never seen that before. It was breaded a little too heavy for me but was good.The dipping sauce, one tartar and one red were really boring and lacked any appeal. I love shrimp sauce with fish and this tasted like catchup with an odd after taste that I didn't like. The clam chowder that came with it was way too salty as was the octopus appetizer that we shared. All in all I expected more from this high end place and am really not all that picky. Maybe I just hit the wrong night  and the salt guy was lurking in the kitchen."}
{"text":"This review is based from just one dining experience here, I'll update it after our next visit.  That said, the food and service was very good. My wife and I ordered a couple of the lighter entrees, and boy, they weren't kidding. At our reciprocal club the \"lighter\" options are still usually enough for a meal. (think European portions) Next time we'll get regular entrees and I'm sure they'll be delicious. Though small, the entrees we had were very tasty as I'm sure all menu options are.  The ambiance could have been better. Mainly because we were seated next to a table of people who were talking loudly through our entire dinner. (\"So we couldn't fit the mercedes, the Lexus and the Infinity in the garage already, and then he goes and buys ANOTHER Lexus!\" -- queue haughty laughter, etc....) Kind of annoying."}
{"text":"Nice and spacious for your conference or hiring event. Corporations have events here of 50-100 people I think and it is a nice space. Kind of oldie worldie and not as fancy as it would seem from their policies. They don't allow jeans to be worn but also didn't really seem to be so enforced. There's plenty of rooms for meetings and large gathering areas for food prep and dining. There is also a nice space to set up a bar."}
{"text":"This is a great bar to have a few drinks with friends and dance on their dance floor.  Monitors in every room display music videos of the song being played, and the lights make it a great atmosphere to let yourself go and have a good time!  The menu is a bit pricey, but well worth it for the fun to be had!    Recommended for the Saturday night dance scene."}
{"text":"I attended a wedding here last night and everything was great.  The space is gorgeous, and well decorated.  It is well laid out, and has a lot of space.  The food was delicious, and the drinks were well made.  This is a wonderful event space."}
{"text":"As a long-standing establishment in Madison's downtown, the history of the Madison Club is fantastic!  What I love the Madison Club for is their top floor bar with unmatched views of the lake over Monona Terrace, as well as their killer food and service!  Every event I've attended here has been well run and impeccably staffed, making it a fantastic addition to Madison's business community as well as social community!  Not to mention they have a reputation for finding and building fabulous chefs....you can thank them for chef Dan Fox being brought to Madison!"}
