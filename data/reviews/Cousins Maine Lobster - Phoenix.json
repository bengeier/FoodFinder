{"text":"I had the CT style lobster roll and the lobster tater tots and I absolutely LOVED IT!! Staff was very friendly! Can't wait to go back again!!"}
{"text":"To start with, we went to the Food Truck Friday because this truck was going to be there. Coupled with another truck that we wanted to try, we talked about it for weeks! Keep in mind that I write these reviews not just to help the customers be wise consumers, but also so that business owners can get feedback from customers and gain insight into running their business in the most successful manner. With that said, I struggle with this review. The company has really been well marketed and over hyped! The truck is beautiful and as up to date as possible. The line was extremely long and it took quite a while for food to come out. While waiting in line I noticed that several people were complaining and returning food! I was honestly pretty worried at that point and tried to hear why they were coming back. The complaints were all the same. The lobster rolls they had ordered were supposed to be hot and that the lobster was cold. I asked one lady what was wrong with her food and she told me that it was ice cold in the middle. People were not complaining about the line to order. They were complaining about the wait for their food. There was a huge group of people waiting for food. Suddenly a woman appeared frantically trying to get into the truck's front door which was locked. She had Walmart bags in her arms. I said to my wife that she must have made a Walmart run for Lobster (We were in the parking lot for Sam's Club and next to the Walmart.) I was joking but I think she went to get bread. That's right my \"roll\" was on bread. I would say it was Texas Toast to be exact. So, it was my turn to order. The guy is taking orders from the window which is quite high, and I had trouble hearing him. He used a tablet to have me sign for my debit card. They ask for an optional tip which I find absurd when no one is doing anything worth tipping. They didn't bring my food and as a matter of fact I had to ask for a napkin and a fork. When I went back to get a knife the lady was very nice, but I still wouldn't say it was worthy of even more money. I must admit that I was taken back by the price. I know that lobster can be expensive, but this is extremely expensive for the size of roll you get. It is about double what I think it is worth. Our order did not take too long to get (about 8 minutes). I guess once the cook came back it was easier to pump out food. By the way I watched to see if she washed her hands and she did.  The man called our name over the loud speaker that is useless! I didn't see anyone else go to the window, so I figured it must be mine. Anyway, we got our food and I was shocked at how small it was. My wife and I always split food. I could eat three of these on my own! We each took our two bites and the Lobster is wonderful. It has a wonderful sweet flavor. There was a small line of mayo on the Texas toast that did not make much difference. I would double the mayo but that is me. It was lobster on bread. Well the wait was over and in two bites the meal was over. I looked at my wife and laughed. I said, \"well that was a big bubble buster!\" She said she thought the flavor was great but that the $20 we spent was not worth it. For the record the roll was $16.50 plus tax and tip. I felt a little robbed to be honest. I am the type of person that tips huge amounts for great service and doesn't mind paying a lot of money for quality food and service. In this case it was a bit much. Let's not forget this is a food truck. They don't even have the overhead of a brick and mortar restaurant! They must be making a killing off the name and notoriety, but it will not last for long because I can't imagine too many people will go twice. I know that I would never do it again. I love Shark Tank, and this is good quality lobster, but they better listen to their customers or they won't be around long. Overall, I rate them a 2. Quantity of food 1, Service 3, Price point 1, Quality of food 5."}
{"text":"This was the best lobster i've had since leaving the east coast 10 years ago!  I've been to a couple of their trucks and have had five star service and food from all of them.  I met the new owners of this food truck and they were great to talk with, I even got to meet the Cousins!
Take my word for it, best lobster ever and worth every penny, plenty of food and the quality can't be beat."}
{"text":"Great promotion for being on All these shows  however they must have brought their \"F\" Team because I order over 30 minutes ago and still No Tacos! 
BTW I have interviewed  a number of family's with negative reviews  about the quality of the food. Oh No I hope I didn't make a mistake, doesn't look good......
OK we had their lobster tacos, REALLY! If I could five 1 star I would, people go elsewhere!!!!!! Disappointment  x 100. Finally after a 55 minute wait received the tacos, \"Where's the Lobster\"? It's called Lobster tacos, not tortillas with cabbage, tomato and  itsy bitsy 4 tiny, not small tiny morales of lobster. UGH!!!!! After having our tacos I made sure that a 5-10 wait really means 50minutes wait. Terrible! I feel the workers because the owners don't really Care! I and everyone I know will know about this lack of Business Service! If Bo from the Sanctuary came and had the same experience he would Never Endorse this establishment."}
{"text":"Granted I've never had a \"lobster roll\" before so I don't have anything to compare it too but I have had Maine Lobster before.  I was really disappointed.  After a few chewy bites of lobster, I finally passed it off to a colleague who finished the other half.  His opinion was that is wasn't bad.  Mine was that I won't do that again.  Pretty much a waste of almost $20 in my opinion."}
{"text":"So disappointed..went to the Gilbert Food truck night tonight, and had the Connecticut Lobster Roll..what a scam! Literally a piece of toast, folded in half, with 5-6 shrimp size lobster pieces..for $20?!?!?! Seriously?! I was thinking it'd be at least 10\" long, in an actual \"roll\" of some sort, and be a nice hearty sandwich. This wouldnt even be considered an appetizer! There are much better food truck choices than this truck!"}
{"text":"Don't bother. I was so excited to give them a try and the reviews have been good. I guess I am just hard to please. I though the lobster roll was average at best. It was very small portions and extremely over priced. Fool me once shame on you.  Not going to fool me again."}
{"text":"Great Lobster Rolls. So buttery and good. Pay no attention to the people who keep saying they are getting cold Lobster. You can order it hot or cold. If you pay attention to what you are ordering you will get the right thing. Tasty big pieces of lobster on a perfectly toasted buttery roll. What's better than that?"}
{"text":"Piping hot lobster bisque and 3 lobster tacos. Fast service. Take your favorite date, it's lobster man!   We thought we were back in Maine at the docks."}
{"text":"Oh my God!! I waited so long to try these lobster rolls. What a disappointment!!!
$17 for a miniature lobster roll! When the guy handed me the bag with both of our rolls in it, I thought he had given us the wrong order. The bag was so lightweight that I wondered if it was an air sandwich! Well I'm glad I got that out of my system and I will NEVER be back, nor will I ever recommend this company to anyone! If you pay via credit card, it prompts you to leave a tip while the worker stands and watches you. I left 15% due to feeling pressured and now I feel even more taken than ever!! I think the Shark Tank endorsement has made them think they're better than they are. Total rip off!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars, I would!  I moved to the Phoenix area from New England less than a year ago. And I have eaten many many lobster rolls in my lifetime.  When I saw that this truck was making its 2017 debut in my neighborhood tonight, I knew I had to be there to see if they really were true to New England.  And I was not disappointed.  I'll be honest, I had to try both the Maine and Connecticut rolls.  Perfection!  The lobster was the star, as it should be, and they came on the New England style hot dog rolls.  (Where can I get those?  I need them back in my life!). And then there is the clam chowdah.  (I had to say it with my Boston accent.). That was for the hubby, but I had to taste.  And I will be ordering it for myself next time.  The cream and the potatoes and the onions and the clams...Oh the clams!  Heaven on my tongue!  I want some now!!!!  

They had some other items on the menu, but when it comes to my lobster, I crave it in its more traditional forms....Steamed or in a roll.  I may never try tots or tacos or quesadillas but if you want to try them, you can.  And if you need something sweet to satisfy that sweet tooth after your taste of the cold New England waters, they covered that with whoopie pies from Wicked Whoopies...Another authentic New England treat.   Thank you Cousins for bringing my favorite things from home to the desert.  They can keep the cold and snow.  I want the lobstah and chowdah."}
{"text":"This food truck was at an event in Chandler yesterday evening. I had never had a lobster roll but had always wanted to try one. So when I saw them there, I figured \"hey, why not!\"

Line was short thankfully and after perusing the menu, I decided on the Connecticut roll since it promised warm buttery, lemony lobster on a New England style roll. Sounded delicious! My 16 yr old son was also excited to try something new and went for the shrimp tacos. I was mildly surprised about how expensive it was - $16.50 for the roll and around $13 for the tacos (with nothing on the side, I might add). But I wasnt about to pay $4 for a side of tater tots!! I figured the signature food items MUST be good with that price point, so I paid the $30+. I unfortunately left a 15% tip right then also - you pay on an iPad and I felt pretty obligated with the worker watching from above inside the truck and the people in line behind me watching me complete the transaction.

We waited about 5 minutes for our food and were excited when they called our name. Boy, was I DISAPPOINTED. The lobster roll itself was small. I mean, maybe the size of my hand type of small and I have small hands. The lobster was supposed to be warm, but wasn't quite what I expected. Not really buttery like I had hoped and the lemony-ness was non-existent. The only good thing was the bread roll itself. I took a couple buts and just couldn't eat anymore of it. My son ate his shrimp tacos but he was disappointed too. They were just ok. There was supposed to be a cilantro lime sauce, but neither of us could taste cilantro or lime. It just tasted like some kind of runny mayo like sauce.

Maybe what we got is what these things are supposed to taste like. If so, I guess maybe I just don't like food from Maine??? I will not be visiting this food truck again. Overpriced for the small portions and just not very good. 

I guess I should have splurged on those tater tots......."}
{"text":"after checking out all the food truck options I chose cousins main lobster....didnt mind the wait (30 min) for good food.i placed my order and had my lobster roll in just a few minutes......however all the hype and long wait was just that...i understand arizona is nowhere near the east coast, i wasnt expecting lobster that was just caught....however, this was the most disappointing lobster roll/lobster I've ever had...there were chunks of \"lobster\"...most extremely chewy...some of which was inedible...my experience may have been a fluke and I will give them another try, however...i cannot personally recommend them.....i can recommend the Main Lobster Lady.  her truck is hard to catch up with, but the lobster tastes freshly prepared, succulent...yummy."}
{"text":"I got the Connecticut lobster roll.  It was literally a piece of bread with lobster and butter.  The lobster was stringy and the portion was small. NOT WORTH $17."}
{"text":"Ordered the lobster tail and tots and my lobster tail was mushy. This food truck is way too over priced to sell old or frozen and thawed then refrozen and re-thawed seafood!"}
{"text":"So glad to come home tonight and find the food truck parked at my complex. I recognized the name right away from Shark Tank so I had to Give it a try. I got one Maine Sandwich with the mayo and one Connecticut with the butter and lemon so we could split and try both plus a cup of the lobster bisque. This place is not cheap but you have to know that about lobster already plus it is so fresh and so very worth every penny. Best lobster bisque I have ever had and the sandwiches were phenom. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Been to this a few times and never disappointed.  Brought the whole family the second time and now we are practically obsessed.  Lobster roll was amazing"}
{"text":"Ordered a bowl of $9 Lobster Bisque today and I'm pretty sure it wasn't made from scratch. Super thin and way over priced. Portions on all their menu items are not satisfactory to call a lunch..
Made sure to mention to co-workers not to waste their money. Very overrated."}
{"text":"I was at the Cardinals vs 49ers game today. I was so excited to try this food truck out. It had the longest line, plus I saw them on shark tank. Must be good right. Sad to say I was beyond disappointed. The Maine lobster roll was horrible.  The lobster was cold, It had no dressing. The tater tots where a little better but again no dressing and cold lobster."}
{"text":"Lots of Lobster love! I've waited a long time to try this truck (mainly because I'm too impatient and hungry to wait in line :) ) they came to my work and I got there when it opened and no line! SCORE! My friend and I split the Lobster Tot's: Tater Tots with cilantro sauce, pico de gallo, and warm Lobster on top. And The Connecticut Lobster Roll: Maine lobster, served warmed with butter and lemon, New England style roll. The Tater Tots were perfectly crunchy, the sauce and pico de gallo, were delicious, and the Lobster was so good. This dish could have used a tad more lobster. But the Connecticut Lobster Roll was over flowing with huge delicious chunks of warm Lobster, and the perfect amount of warm butter. The roll was so soft, yet nice and crisp on the outside. Needless to say, everything just melted in your mouth and was worth the money! Shark Tank did good on this one."}
{"text":"How can you charge $17 for a lobster roll that is so tiny it wouldn't satisfy a toddler. Horribly over priced with minuscule portions. I have no issue with paying upwards of $20 for a lobster roll I've even paid more but this place is ridiculous and an absolute rip off. If I could give less than one star I would."}
{"text":"This week for Foodie Friday we decided on Food Truck Friday because Cousins Maine Lobster was debuting their food truck at Park West location. I was determined to try a lobster roll. It was so delicious and worth the wait in line. We ordered the Maine lobster roll and lobster tacos. Unfortunately we scarfed them down so fast we forgot to snap a pic but managed a pic of one taco. Lol!! The food was awesome! We met Jimmy, one of the cousins, and he was such an amazing guy and very cute too. He took time out to talk to us and tell us about their food and their philosophy. The lobster roll was fantastic! Lobster in every bite and cooked to perfection and served on a roll that would have tasted great even on its own. The lobster tacos were delicious too. The pico had just enough zing to add a tiny bit of spice and the lobster was perfect."}
{"text":"Awesome food and never disappoints! It's a taste of Maine right here in Arizona! It's a little pricey for a sandwich but it's worth every penny in my opinion. Also, try the blueberry soda...it's delicious!!"}
{"text":"Just sampled a \"Main Lobster Roll\" in Mesa.  1st...tiny, tiny, tiny; 2nd.... I grew up in New England and this bears no resemblance to the great lobster rolls we ate at the shore; and 3rd...way too expensive.  A little personality on the part of the staff wouldn't hurt.  On the positive side, the lobster did taste fresh."}
{"text":"I tried Cousins Maine Lobster Roll today and was very disappointed...
If you want to eat lobster go to a restaurant and dine out.  Forget the food truck!"}
{"text":"So my first Saturday back in AZ I went to the farmers market at park west and this food truck was there. I came with my mom, brother, sister in law and niece. I heard my brother say it was good. And I noticed on the truck it said something about shark tank so I was in at that point. I got lobster tacos. It came with 3. It was SO good. I had a hard time eating it all lol. My family each took a bite or two. Perfect toppings. Perfect flavors. Just perfect all around. It was a bit pricey. But I see why. I would definitely eat this again. I don't know if they are here every Saturday or not. This was the first time I had been to the farmers market truly. I definitely recommend trying. I love lobster and I love tacos. It was soft tacos by the way. Obviously by my picture you can tell. Definitely try!"}
{"text":"Was excited to see a lobster truck at an event a few weeks ago. I'm from Boston so when I can get a lobster roll it is a win. Wow was I setting myself up for disappointment. I ordered 2 Maine lobster rolls and an order of lobster tots. These were the smallest lobster rolls I have ever had, for $17 each. I get it, lobster is expensive and I don't mind paying for a quality product, this was far from quality. The lobster tasted like it was previously frozen, and little other taste. I took the meat from both rolls and transferred it into one...then it actually looked like a real one. Didn't taste good at all. The lobster tots, I'm not sure what to make of them. Its a lousy combination of cafeteria tots with very little meat and pico de gallo on it, horrible idea.What a waste of $56 on basically nothing, I should have known it was a bad sign when the bag was so light. I have gone to the Maine lobster Lady several times and they are very good. 
Afterward I did some research and found out that this food truck is a franchise with about 14 trucks around the country. One of the locations claims to be in Portland Maine...really hard to believe that they could serve this kind of seafood and make any money down East. Long story short, don't waste your time or money on this \"food\" truck."}
{"text":"I came to the Arizona Cardinals Draft party and came across this unique food truck called Cousins Maine Lobster. I first went around to see what everyone else had, but I  went back to this truck and ordered their smothered tator tots with pico de gallo and the lady there recommend the buffalo sauce with the tots. I tried the tots with the buffalo sauce, they were amazing just the right amount of flavor with every bite I took. If you are at an event or you see this truck around do not hesitate to order from them their food is excellent. Great job Cousins Maine Lobster."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this truck. I ordered the Maine lobster roll because I have been dying to try one! The pictures looked delicious and I figured if one of the investors from shark tank was behind it, then it must be good! Nope. The roll itself is TINY and I payed $17 + tax and tip. The mayo sauce that was supposed to be on it was nowhere to be found and the lobster had zero taste. I was just eating cold, chewy, tasteless lobster on toasted bread. I won't be visiting this truck again."}
{"text":"Every time they are on my side of town I can't wait to go and get shrimp tacos and clam chowder and you could never forget those whoopie pies also"}
{"text":"OH, yummy. I was so sad when I finished my lobster roll, as it was absolutely delicious. Stuffed with tender tasty bites, bathed in butter, this roll is to live for! I am wishing that I could follow the truck every day. Don't for one minute think this is expensive....go for it. Almost a life changing experience! Without doubt the finest lobster I have had the pleasure of eating."}
{"text":"Ugh horrible!!! 
I spent $40 on shrimp the size of my pinky toe nail and a tiny lobster roll on a hot dog bun. Not the least bit happy... seriously extremely angry about it. Honestly want to cry that I just spent my money that I really can't afford on this."}
{"text":"Went to them while at a food truck rally in Peoria at the sports complex.  Out of all the options they definitely had the longest line (which must mean something).  We had been wanting to try it out so we got it.  It was really good, fresh food!  Obviously being that we are in the desert sometimes it is hard to find good seafood but this was definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"small portions and super big prices...better off somewhere else....maybe a real sea food restaurant.....hahahah"}
{"text":"Blah boring, chewy... What I like to call a \"why bother\".  Nothing Maine about it unless it was frozen and shipped.  $18 disappointment.  I guess I'll have to go to New England soon for the real thing."}
{"text":"Can I give them a 6?

Well that was the best lobster roll I had since I was in Plymouth Mass. 

The Connecticut roll was great. Warm with butter. Ohh so good. I may have wanted a little extra butter but I am not complaining. 

My son had the Maine roll. Cold with a hint of mayo. He said it was excellent. 

We also had the lobster tots. They were good. Probably not worth the price for tots but the sauce on them was very tasty. 

Is it pricey yes especially for a food truck. However, the quality makes up for it. You truly do get what you pay for. 

I would not hesitate to return here. Very well done. 

Also the people were very warm and seemed to be enjoying they day."}
{"text":"How do you come to a food truck event with a broken generator? Waste of time and thanks for nothing"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to have this again!  Wow, this time it was full of sweet lobster.  My sandwich was overflowing.  There is one other place that I
Had previously ranked higher.  The other place is $18.50.  Cousins lobster rolls run $16.50 and they have the option of hot or cold.  The bread is good too.  I liked it for the fresh lobster, quantity of lobster, price and supporting a small business."}
{"text":"So there is new food truck in town, what's a girl to do??? Drive to Mesa, which is where they happened to be that day, and order!  I got the Lobster Bisque, AMAZING!!  Then I got the Lobster Tacos, OH MY GOSH!!! Then I got the quesadilla, DELICIOUS!! Then I got the Lobster Roll, ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? Then I got the Tater Tots loaded with Lobster and sauce and DELICIOUSNESS and if that wasn't enough....this food truck of heaven has 2 kinds of Ice Cream to choose from.  First is the Whoopee Pie Ice Cream and Second is the Lobster Ice Cream, I got BOTH!!! THEY WERE OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!  Now you may think I am exaggerating, but I am not!!  My husband and I drove to Mesa, ordered all this food and enjoyed it ALL!  Cousins Maine Lobster is seriously AMAZING and Carrie, the Owner, is better than all of it!!!!  Check it out!!!  YOU WILL BE IN HEAVEN!!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to some clever marketing and media attention, Cousins Maine Lobster is one of those \"chain\" trucks that everyone wants to try at least once. When I see them on Food Truck Friday, the line is always long, so I assume that they must be pretty good, right?

And then I read all of the reviews that all pretty much say the same thing. The wait is long. The roll is small. And the price is way too damned high for what you're actually getting.

And after trying them, my opinion pretty much mirrors what everyone else is saying.

For a whopping 16.50, you can get a hot dog-sized lobster roll called the Connecticut. The roll is served warm with butter and lemon - or at least that's what it says on the menu. Further research revealed that the price seems to vary based on city/location, which probably takes into account several different factors, including season, scarcity, and how gullible the operators think customers are in that particular city.

So, after coming to terms with the fact that I could have obtained a well-crafted wood-fired pizza for the price of this smart-phone-sized lobster roll, I was hoping it would at least deliver in terms of quality and execution. 

Unfortunately, it didn't.

The lobster was not warm, despite the menu stating that it would be. The butter and lemon that was supposed to be added was almost nonexistent, doing very little to enhance the flavor of what was already an unusually cold roll. In fact, it was so forgettable that I'm currently kicking myself for not trusting Yelpers and opting for an alternative food truck option.

Should you try it at least once? I guess, but when you're out seventeen dollars and have next to nothing to show for it, don't blame me.

On a side note, the owner did comment on this review, but that was merely for show, as when I followed up and explained that the primary issue wasn't the price or size, but the actual food itself not being as described, I received no response - which further solidifies my poor review.

Don't bother."}
{"text":"I was finally able to stumble upon this food truck...and at Country Thunder, no less!  I opted for the Connecticut as I wasn't in a mayo-sauce mood.  Sandwich was very good, but a little expensive at $19.  Quality lobster isn't cheap!"}
{"text":"Was so excited to find the truck in Fountain Hills, AZ today but  wow, what a disappointment ? Ordered the Lobster tail and tots... tail was very small and undercooked on top of a huge pile of tater tots ? Returned and asked if it was possible to switch to a roll instead.  Was told I couldn't switch... paid $16.00 for something I threw away ? Tried to eat more of it but glad I couldn't as I have a terrible stomach ache now? So much for Cousins Lobster truck
Disappointing ?"}
{"text":"I like the concept, I like their food. I wish they prices were more reasonable,  but it's hard and expensive to bring fresh labster from Main. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Wife heard they were in Fountain Hills by Chase Bank and dinner was decided. Brought our Connecticut Rolls home and it was still warm and tasty. Lots of lobster for such a small roll. When I bit into mine, a piece fell on the floor and our dog was all over it in a flash.
Nothing better than having a lobster roll and watching Loyola-Chicago beating K-State, 19 point lead."}
{"text":"Lobster rolls are my favorite, but not this one! Lobster meat was way too chewy, even though in chunks. And it needed something to add flavor, not just mayo. I've had the real deal in Maine by the sea, so I know what it should taste like. Seventeen dollars is too much at Cousins. The cup of chowder tasted great even though mostly potatoes. Seven dollars for that. Prices too high!"}
{"text":"Tried to see about scheduling this truck for a private party. 1 email and 3 phone calls...they don't even call/respond back. Finally got ahold of them - never talked to someone so uninterested in business in my life. Guess I'll give the business to another truck. Not sure how these guys make it . Do yourself a favor and check out the main lobster lady! Great to work with!"}
{"text":"Another delectable lobster roll food truck! I was excited to see Cousins Maine Lobster at the McClintock Farmer's Market. The menu differs from the Maine Lobster Lady in that their sole focus is lobster (Vs. offering other seafood such as clams and haddock). Cousins also offers more of a Southwestern twist on their Maine lobster, offering quesadillas and tacos. 

I opted for the Connecticut lobster roll, a buttery warm concoction of toasted bread and fresh lobster. The meat was perfectly tender, and had a lovely coating of melted butter that meshed well with the sweet lobster meat. The only slight negative is that I would have liked a little more lemon juice over the whole roll to provide some extra acid flavor to accentuate the sweetness of the meat even more (I could only taste a faint hint of lemon towards the end of the roll). 

Service was warm and friendly. My lobster roll was $17 and had whole claw pieces in it. I can't wait to try more of their lobster items! The lobster tater tots sound amazing..."}
{"text":"I had an oppportunity to visit this food truck last weekend. Cool menu, very good food. A little on the pricey side for a smallish  lobster roll. But then again it is lobster. High quality lobster on the tolland very friendly service. Very knowledgable about the menu items. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Wow, call the police, I have been robbed! Plunked down $17 for the tiniest lobster roll ever seen. To top that off the lobster was tasteless, water loaded and mushy with a stripe. Of mayo. The only reason for two stars was the cute little 4 inch bun was tasty.  Save your money and stick to the $4 tater tots if you must eat here."}
{"text":"I had so much hype going to a food truck party just for this truck. BUT It was just ok :( the lobster tasted frozen and chewy. The last was nice when we were ordering tho. Maybe it was just a bad batch?!"}
{"text":"Tried this food truck at the Phoenix food truck festival and waited in a one hour line!! I thought it would be totally worth it and was very disappointed. It was 17.00 for a baby lobster roll... But the quality was good just not worth the price or wait!"}
{"text":"Managed to catch the truck at our neighborhood farmers market early Saturday morning and the lobster tacos were great. Had 2 orders followed with a bowl of lobster bisque. Food was spot on... Some items were a bit pricey, but it ain't chicken, it's lobster people... In Arizona... enjoy, as I did!"}
{"text":"JUST SAY NO! 
We were at the Barrett Jackson car auction this past weekend, and went outside to look for The Maine Lobster Lady in food court row. We have had her lobster rolls here previously, and they are luscious and big ...but she wasn't at the auction this year. We had never heard of this Cousins Maine Lobster truck, and reluctantly gave them a try. OMG, what a major disappointment. The $22.00 (can you say GOUGING) per roll Connecticut lobster rolls were NOT served warm with butter as clearly \"advertised\"         on the truck, the \"miniature\" rolls were COLD, and the tiny portion of lobster meat was really chewy and cold. When the group in line behind us saw the sham, they all left to go to another food vendor. 

The business card that the guys at the food truck gave us (trying to drum up catering business) had photos of lobster rolls on it that would lure most people in. We all know about deceitful photos of food though!!!

Note to the boys, you might want to think again about your franchising efforts. Also, Barrett Jackson is NOT the place to make a bad impression on new customers."}
{"text":"Clearly corp, doesn't monitor the franchisees - yikes.  Was at the Fountain Hills car show, bellied up to the line at cousins.  Maine lobster roll and 2 lobster tacos and 33.00 later.  First the product looks NOTHING like the pictures, its texas toast not a roll - and I believe I saw 1 tiny tiny piece of lobster on the roll.  Tasted okay, toast was fine.  What a absolutely waste of money, but it is the American way, try to give as least as possible, while charging the most.  They might?????  Have 1.00 in total product.  Tacos - well, I am pretty sure there was NO lobster, just lots of lettuce and Sauce.

Should hit up the other sandwich truck - they looked great!"}
{"text":"I LOVE lobsta, so when I saw the Cousins would be at Wren House this week, I knew I had to plan my evening around it. I was there early, one of the first in line and ordered the CT-style roll and a cup of bisque. The 29.00 price tag (after tip) was a bit of a sticker shock, but I've paid that much before so I rolled with it. Lobster order is up- I'm ready to dig in! 
That's when I realized the roll was the smallest dinkiest roll I've ever seen- at restaurants you maybe will get one thus small but it comes with 2 other ones-here, I paid $16.50 for a roll barely the size of my palm. The lobster was cold and there wasn't enough warm butter for my taste. The bisque had nice flavor but no lobster to be found. I was excited to be eating lobster but couldn't help thinking how much better Maine Lobster Lady is compared to this truck. 
Overall, it's lobster and it's tasty but the price point and the lack of delivery on the lobster experience left a lot to be desired. Not gonna be revisiting."}
{"text":"Triple Negative!
Over hyped, 
Over Rated and 
OVERLY Disappointed. 
I've never made a purchase that has left me so sad. 
3 slim slices of lobster on a hot dog bun for $17 are you kidding me? 
I feel like I was robed and should call the police. 
Honestly the company should be ashamed of themselves for pilfering people out of their hard earned money.

Taking a crane kick to the marbles would have left me feeling better than this purchase did."}
{"text":"I had recently attended the festival of food trucks at Parke West in Jan 2017. I enjoy going to these events looking for that diamond in the rough. This was the grand opening of Cousins Maine Lobster in Phoenix. Sabin and Jim were there as well and were very open and cordial with the customers. I had hit a few of the other trucks prior to trying this one so all I could make room for was the lobster bisque. I have to say this lobster bisque was the best that i have had from a food truck. Far superior to another lobster truck truck that frequents the valley during the winter months. The wife and I are very excited to try other things from their menu next time!

Hope to have an update soon!"}
{"text":"Wow! I've been craving lobster since my last trip to the east coast, it's such a shame that standards for seafood are so incredibly high, being in a high desert state like Arizona. I was throughly impressed and it certainly hit the spot for my lobster craving.  I wish I was one of those 3 star reviewers that had such amazing experiences with coastal fare that I could shade the fresh amazing offerings available. 
Regardless. I'm getting myself al worked up with the lack of gratitude of others.

I had the lobster roll, Connecticut style, gluten free aka sans bun and I wasn't disappointed. I had a heaping helping of meat dipped in butter that made me want more and if it weren't $16 maybe I would have. Lol not only did I save the calories and carbs in the bun, I don't feel yucky and bloated after eating the roll, GF certainly the way to go for office fare on the go. 
I also got a Whoopee pie  (sp?) which was exciting and delicious until I started reading the package and to a tune of 450 calories decided to pump the breaks. Not only was it 200% too sweet for me it would have been a cheat week if I ate the whole thing, it's certainly a shareable addition. 
I was excited and grateful to see Cousins roll up in my complex for lunch, especially since I didn't have to wait in a line 300 deep at a good truck festival to partake in the deliciousness. 
My only feedback would be on shading. Though only 11:30a, the sun was blaring and in the middle of June with no where near comfortable to stand outside in sun, no bueno. especially since most of the patrons were dressed in semi-professional garb to protect us from the 70 degree AC and the 50 degree variance to stand outside for Maine Lobster awesome sauce. Umbrellas would have been appreciated, but I won't complain."}
{"text":"4 years ago July 1 my father made his transition.  My folks were from NH and my mother is in assisted living.  They moved West with 2 daughters before I was born.  She has dementia but loves getting her Yankee magazine every month.  This month's magazine was all about \"lobstah\" and she has had a serious jones for a lobster roll for months. When the magazine came in and had a lobster on the cover and a Lobster Roll hunt I thought it was just cruel.  When she saw the magazine she sadly said that when we went back East for Dad's funeral she had her last one.  Well, this got me where I lived so I started searching.  Yelp helped find me the name of this food truck and and to my great fortune they were going to be at Uptown Farmers Market near me.  Yay!  I went and they had her Maine style roll which had HUGE chucks of lobster served cold with a skosh of mayo.  I took it to her and she was so happy and ate the whole thing!  Bragged to everyone at the home about it too!  It made her \"summah\".  Her statement of never having another \"lobstah roll\" was not true.  Her Zonie daughter scored her one."}
{"text":"This is a bittersweet review.

Don't get me wrong, the Connecticut lobster roll (served warm with butter) was terrific in flavor. Maybe just a smidge on the chewy side, but otherwise delicious. But almost $20 for a slider? I'm not the biggest eater out there. But this sandwich is small!

A nearby office tower was bringing in food trucks during a time when they closed up restaurant options. I heard Cousins was going to be there, so I went. There was no line, so that was great. The wait for food was reasonable. But I must admit to some sticker shock when I shelled out over $17 for a lunch sandwich. 'Oh, well, Bacon; treat yourself,' I told myself. [Yes, I still refer to myself at Bacon occasionally] Alas, I was still painfully hungry after returning to the office and polishing off this sandwich. Fortunately, I had options to sate that.

I asked a coworker who also ate there on the same day what she thought, and it was similar yet so different from my own review: Among the best lobster she had eaten, but so rich she almost couldn't finish eating it. I think she eats like a bird.

Overall, I'm happy I was able to experience the Cousins."}
