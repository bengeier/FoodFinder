{"text":"As an italian, I hold other italian restaurants to the highest standards. Those standards being my nonna's food. This place just does it right. Their veal sandwich is priced reasonably, 6.50+/-, is a decent size and highly flavourful. The bun for the sandwich was soft and fresh. The sauce was sweet, flavourful, not sour and did not have that \"can\" taste. The veal was nicely breaded, cooked well and was not overly greasy or deep fried. It just good old fashioned italian food. Their pasta is nice as well but the real winner is the sandwiches.  The staff was fast to serve me, polite and very helpful. This place is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Antonio's is my favourite place to eat in Whitby. The meatball melt is a good size and value for lunch time, and on multiple occasions I will take home one of their lasagnas for dinner. Antonio's has become my go-to restaurant in Whitby, whenever I can't decide where I want to go for dinner I always find myself coming back here. Oh, the service is unbelievably quick regardless of the size of line. Antonio's is a must try restaurant if you're in Whitby."}
{"text":"Probably rating this as the #1 worst place to go to for italian sandwiches.    First, we only came here because of a family member who referred us to this place to try their veal sandwich.  We should have known they don't have good taste for good food when they referred us to Teddy's before and we weren't a fan of the quality of food there either.   We like to try new places and have been to this area before to try their sandwich but they were closed so we went next door and had a chicken sandwich there which was out of this world good!!!  Almost as good as California Sandwiches by College Street.    Getting back to Antonio's: The service was terrible by the woman clerk.  She was very rude.  We placed an order for 2 veal sandwiches.  The menu says \"Veal Sandwich $6.20)...NOTHING written about extra topping charges.  They asked us what we want on them and we asked what toppings they have and they advised us \"onions, red peppers and mushrooms\" so we said yes to all three.  They said ok and proceeded to take orders from other customers.  I went to the washroom and when I came out and my boyfriend was in the washroom and I was looking at what I want to drink, the woman behind the counter (in front of a few other customers) calls to me across the room as I am looking at the fridge to ask me what I want to drink....I looked at her puzzled as everyone is looking at me...I answered \"I am just looking and waiting for my boyfriend to decide what he wants to drink as well\".  She then says \"Which one is he?\" LOL Like it matters...I repeated myself and said \"he is in the washroom\".  She then says \"I have you in the till\".  I then once again have to respond and say as I chuckle \"OK....I am waiting to see what drink he wants?\" and she FURTHER ASKS \"do u know if it will be a pop or bottle?\".  OMG I thought I was going to leave...she was the most annoying, irritating clerk EVER.  What was the rush??? She was serving 3 other customers who were waiting there...why are you badgering me over a drink? PS:: this is all within a minute!!!    My boyfriend came out of the washroom and we picked our drinks and paid $20.00 approx. for the 2 veal and a big bottle of coke (in a glass)....they charged us $1.50 per topping....We werent going to make an issue out of it although it doesn't say anything about paying $1.50 to $1.75 per topping......furthermore,  I think someone might have ate the veal on the way to our table...it was as thin as a piece of roast beef cold cut. You can't even find the toppings. and we paid about $6.00 extra for them (but they were no where to be found)..I found 3 pieces of mushroom.  The only good thing about that sandwich was the bun and the tomato sauce.  WORST SANDWICH EVER! Worst service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! First and last time for us!"}
