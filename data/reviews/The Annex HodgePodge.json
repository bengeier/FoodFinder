{"text":"I am not a fan of sandwiches at all. But I have to say, I LOVE THESE SANDWICHES. They are so wholesome and you can taste the quality and freshness. They do take their time to prepare but it's always worth the wait. My fave is definitely the Walmer. The Madison is another recommendation.  Maybe be prepared to have cash on hand, sometimes their debit machine isn't working."}
{"text":"Had the Madison sandwich and the coleslaw. They informed me that their chicken was from Sanagan's today. It was incredible! I need to go more regularly. Salad was great as well. Great, healthy food."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for a few years now and am collecting stamps on my sandwich/soup/combo card to get the 11th for free!   I will often pass by here on my way home from work, so if you are too lazy to cook dinner it's the perfect place to pick it up.  Or you could pretend you made it and invite people over.  The sandwiches are yummy, especially because they get shmushed in a panini press and it becomes extra delicious.  They are named after Annex Streets, so it gives the place that extra neighbourhood feel.  A lot have meat, but you can get veggie options.  All soups are fresh and home made (their beet soup won an award last year) and you can get them in individual take out sizes, or buy a glass jar of soup that you can take home and eat over a week.  There are also fresh salad options and if you don't want a fresh sandwich, have pre-made veggie wraps to go, which they can also unwrap and put on the press.  Desserts are from Sweets of the Earth.  It is a little nook right by Dupont subway, so it's in a very convenient location and has provided me and my friends with many a tasty meal.  If you get a combo, you might have to eat only half a sandwich and save the second half for later because the soups are so thick and full of goodness."}
{"text":"Went to try their Onigiri and not impressed. The seaweed paper inevitably falls apart every time we unwrap it (3 out of 3 we bought). The rice is quite bland, needs a bit more vinegar, sugar, and salt. The filling for the chili + kelp is good, but extremely concentrated in the middle. So that the initial bite is extremely bland, and the bites in the middle has way too strong of a flavor. Tried the beet and chicken as well, the filling for those are nothing special, kinda like a $2/jar meat or pickle sauce you get at the supermarket.   I would give them 2 stars for the onigiri, but since I haven't tried their sandwiches, it wouldn't be fair. Maybe their sandwiches are alot better..."}
{"text":"I had The Spadina sandwich (sausage) with tomato and basil soup!  Sooo impressed!!!!  I also enjoyed the Moroccan Mint Tea and it was so refreshing.  This place is steps away from the DuPont subway stop so if you are in the area pop in and try just about anything and you won't be disappointed. Ask Jenna the owner for her recommendation as she won't steer you in the wrong direction.  Already planning my next excursion to the area so I can try something else. Delicious"}
{"text":"Mostly good food and Delicious tea. However the hygiene at this place is not good. Server uses her hand to handle money and food and scoops up salad using her food handling, smokers fingers. Totally grosse!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this place because it's close to George Brown. I had initially planned on stopping by the Live Organic Food Bar, but they werent open for another half hour. So i walked around looking for somewhere else to have a bite to eat and came across the HodgePodge. I was pleasantly surprised! I had the Madison and made my own pressed juice (Cucumber, Orange and Lime). Both were completely delicious. It's a small, quaint little cafe (?) that I can see myself visiting over and over again. The lady that served me was very friendly and helpful seeing how it was my first time there. They also offer a student discount with your student ID card. For my drink and sandwich it was 13 dollars, which is a bit pricey but I'd rather spend the extra dollars to get something good for me and fresh than spend 8/9 dollars at someplace like McDonalds. I also picked up their rewards card."}
{"text":"I seem to make a habit of ignoring places that serve Awesome food in my neighbourhood. The Annex Hodgepodge was one of them... But not anymore! It's a tiny shop along the Dupont Strip and I've passed by it everyday to and from work for over a year. I'm not a sandwich person, but I crave it once in a while. Decided to stop in after work to finally try one of their sandwiches.  I had: - The Madison Wow! Packed with perfectly seasoned chicken, good chipotle and sundried tomato flavour. The bread was nice and crispy. - side of squash pasta salad Great balanced flavour with a hint of spice. - a jar of spicy sweet potato soup $10/750ml It's in my fridge, will try it soon enough. The sandwich and pasta salad were very filling, I only got thru half.  The space is tight with 2 tables and 4 stool, but it's nice and cozy, especially on a rainy day like today. The lady at the counter prepared the food pretty fast. The debit machine was a bit tempermental, but she was able to get it to work.  This place is a must if you want a great sandwich! It's near the Dupont subway station. They're the one with the black and white striped awning. Definitely coming back here to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This is definitely a very unique little place on Dupont and Spadina.  what I had: madison sandwich, house coffee.  Here is the ratings breakdown:  service: 4, good. They were polite, recommended a delicious option, and even let me pay a couple of hours later, as I had not realized their banking machine did not take my card.  food: 4. the madison sandwich was fresh and delicious, lots of filling inside, although could be a little bit more sauce on it (but I like it with lots of sauce). THe bread was grilled just perfectly, and was crispy on outside, soft on inside. Coffee was mediocre, but then again they are no known for that anyways.  price: 9$, this is a rating of 3 for a place like this (no where to sit even). not a bargain but it was ok.  portion size: 3, decent portion but not exactly large. I place a big value on a good portion in my reviews, but this matters more when the food is good, since I dont like to get more of bad food, only good! (not sure if this makes any sense, if it doesnt go ahead an message me and I'll explain).  overall, not bad, I will go there again for a sandwich once in a while, but I won't run to it. there is no 3.5 here, but that's truly what the rating is, so to be conservative I am going with a 3."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today after seeing my co-workers have sandwiches from here over the past couple of weeks and wanted to see if they tasted as good as they looked/smelled.  I got the Madison sambo and it was pretty sensational. Great panini - very fresh, and delicious ingredients. Nice n juicy chicken breast, and fantastic chipotle mayo.   I don't like cheese so the very nice lady behind the counter suggested I get caremalized onions instead and it was a great call! One of the best sandwiches I've had in a long long time.  Only issue is the price. If this place was a couple of bucks cheaper then I'd be there several times a week. At 9 bucks (tax included) for a sambo, I'll be picking and choosing when I go. If someone was offering to buy lunch though, this would be up there with my recommendations in the area."}
{"text":"I have been popping in to the Hodge Podge for a year or so now every other week when I'm heading over to Sutherland Chan for a massage. I grab the Morrocan Mint tea for me and a coffee for the receptionist. The chocolate cookies are delicious there. The owner is super sweet and friendly as well."}
{"text":"Fresh. Tasty. Healthy. It's got to be one of the best quick lunches I've had in a while.   Hidden away at Dupont and Spadina, you might miss it as you walk by (as with a lot of the small establishments on the street).  Mostly takeout, there are a few (count 8) seats inside and outside.   They have excellent cibatta grilled paninis - today I had the Walmer (juicy roast beef, dijon, mayo and tons of carmelized onions) $7.99 ($10.49 soup/salad combo).   They also have vegan wraps (many pre-made kinds which can be heated up toasty for you) $3,99, soups, pre-made sandwiches, organic pastries and coffee. Check out the menu I snapped a photo of in the pictures.   please please please try the Ice Moroccan Mint Tea. It's a sweet, minty iced tea that you will not be disappointed. I usually don't like too minty type drinks like mojitos and the like, but this one was more sweet and lemony and perfect. Although, my friend says too minty - to each his own. TRY IT! $1.99  The folks that work here are super friendly and chatty. If even you don't want to chat, they will get you to smile.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Just went here yesterday on a whim and it was one of the best lunches I've had in years. I was looking for something fresh and healthy and considered going to Live down the street but thought I'd try something new. I'm so glad I did.  I had the Madison Sandwich and the Curried Carrot and Ginger Soup and oh my, both were incredible. The grilled chicken in the sandwich was incredibly moist and well seasoned. And they do not skimp on the chicken at all. The soup was very hearty and garnished with cilantro, which I love (though she did ask me if I wanted some. I know cilantro can be a polarizing herb so this was just one example of the great customer service).   The woman serving me, who I've learned was the proprietor was incredibly friendly and helpful and made me feel welcome in what is a very intimate space.   The soup and sandwich cookie with a \"flourless cashew cookie\" from Sweets of the Earth (which was also very tasty) came out to just under $15. So not super cheap but great value for fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"The Bedford($7.99)  Description: Authentically spiced pastrami with seasoned tomato slices, baby arugula leaves, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard and grated asiago cheese grilled in a Swiss rectangle panini.  Highlight **Swiss Rectangle Panini**  Being a non-sammich follower, Breads fall under the radar for me. One of those Food Group subcats I seldom choose for carb-loading. I do admire the thin Panini Bread having an outside crunch factor. Inside holds the ingredients to perfection that will make Earl of Sandwich not lose sight of his perfect hand. Proportions of Ingredients to Bread was also on point.  Nicely done."}
{"text":"The food tastes wonderful, the service is friendly and personal, and we had our sandwiches and sides pretty quickly.   There's only one problem: it's basically snack-sized. It's not enough for an adult meal. And at $12 per person, it's not a \"$\" it's a \"$$\" for Yelp. You can get more food for a better price at many other places.   Other than that, it was a great snack venue and I'll definitely be back when I have enough money."}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot that offers yummy soups, salads, pannini pressed sandwiches and pre made vegan wraps. Tip... Want more in the sandwich? Ask for extra veggies for a small fee. The staff great and very friendly.  ."}
{"text":"3.5 stars....   1. I had the Madison sandwich. It is just an average sized sandwich grilled in a panini press. The chicken on the sandwich was moist and flavourful, but the sandwich was a bit on the salty side overall. 2. At 10$ out the door, the sandwich was on the pricey side. A cup of soup \"combo\" pushed things closer to 14$ before any drinks are added. 3. There is really nowhere to sit here, perhaps 4 seats. The people who come here to sit are generally the same folks who love to sit for over an hour pretending to be clueless or the Queen of the Annex while others trudge out into the snow to eat. 4. Service here is decent for what it is.  In conclusion, this is a good (not great) sandwich that is a bit overpriced in a small space where you are best served getting your meal to go. Nothing was bad, yet nothing about the experience made me feel in a hurry to return."}
{"text":"Yummy, affordable vegetarian options!!    It's great to have this place here, because all the other yummy places around here (Live organic raw foodbar & Mystic oven) are yummy and waaaay too pricey for a quick bite of food.  Altho it's not huge it definitely does the trick - yay!"}
{"text":"Tiny little place with barely any room to sit, but definitely worth squeezing into. The menu is quite limited. Tried two sandwiches, both great. While not a fan of beet, I thought I would take a chance and try their beet juice cocktail - delicious!"}
{"text":"Tasty but under new management. A little more expensive than I would have liked for the portions, but still enjoyed the soup/sandwich combo.  Current owner is lovely."}
{"text":"Visited after a trip to Casa Loma.   It is a very tiny place where you can get good-for-you sandwiches & wraps. You can also pick up a fresh made juice: got one with beet juice, lime & mint."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are very tasty.  We had the sweet potato and the Madison chicken sandwiches and both enjoyed them very much.  There are two or so tables inside where you can eat. The pricing (about $10 per sandwich) does make it a rather expensive lunch, though perhaps not by Toronto standards. The service was very friendly, though there was just one person manning the shop, and a steady stream of people coming in."}
{"text":"Just perfect sandwich-salad combination. Also some vegans option. The decor is nice and the area is very nice. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Walking along Dupont on a Hot Summer afternoon.... Saw the sign \"Moroccan Mint Tea\" $1.99, hmmm sounded refreshing...   There are a couple of bar stools seatings inside Annex Hodge but it was unbearable hot inside with Air Conditioning. Luckily there are 2 tables set up by the sidewalk right outside...   Moroccan Mint Tea was A-OK! Refreshing with a hint of honey and a drizzle of fresh lemon juice. Wish can be more icy cold...to combat the hot weather.   Sitting by the sidewalk, inhaling the exhaust from the cars driven by during rush hours......   My Hot Yoga Date for sure will be interested in the Vegan and Vegetarian options Annex HodgePodge offers."}
