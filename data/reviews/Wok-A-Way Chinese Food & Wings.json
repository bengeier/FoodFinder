{"text":"We have been ordering from this place for the last  12 years and  love it!!! very friendly service and usually very quick delivery. Not owned by Chinese but they have a Chinese cook.:):)"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised! Very yummy food and the price was very reasonable. We would definitely order again. Only complaint would be that the food was very greasy - we didn't love that, but overall, the food tasted great."}
{"text":"Its a small place and doesn't look like much, but the food is very good; always get the Singapore noodles - which are very tasty; the hungry man specials is great for $10 includes a drink, chicken balls, fried rice, etc;"}
{"text":"Very much a hole in the wall type establishment but the food is cheap and tasty.  We tried the calamari, chicken wings, house fried rice and General Tso chicken.    The calamari was excellent, tender and not too greasy.  Wings were crispy, flavorful and a good size. House fried rice is basically fried rice with pork, shrimp and chicken.  It was ok but didn't really stand out for us.    The General Tso was adequate--we probably would not order it again--too much breading.  Service was fine as we did take out.  The restaurant seems to be renovating? Also it appears the plaza is slated to become condos."}
{"text":"Been ordering from here for 2 yrs. Excellent food and decent prices. Recommend wok a way fried rice and their chicken wings. Delivery can be long wait so order early as this restaurant is very busy especially on weekends"}
{"text":"3.5 star, because it's your average American style Chinese food. Order arrived faster than estimated, the food was hot, and the delivery driver was very friendly. My issues were that the spring rolls, egg rolls, and chicken balls were all very greasy, and the Cantonese chow mein noodles tasted off--almost a bit fishy. Not sure if they were just having an off night, but I don't think I would order from Wok-A-Way again.   Update: Ordered again tonight, same food, but much better this time. Received same great friendly service. Delivery took a bit long but they warned me that they were extremely busy. Would order from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner for one combo D with sweet and sour shrimps. It had a total of three shrimps. I understand for the price point of $7, three shrimps are reasonable, but they are very heavily battered. It was 1/3 shrimp and 2/3 batter, and it tasted like it was soaked in oil. I couldn't finish my meal at all. I came here because of the good ratings, maybe I just ordered the wrong dish."}
{"text":"Id give a 3.5 closer to a 4. Customer service is great, i called in my order and had my bf pick it up. Was very easy to order no issues straight to the point. Also when my bf picked up the food he told me how nice they were which is another plus.  The food is typical western chinese food. The one thing i loved mosy was the chicken balls was actually more chicken then dough. When does that ever happen lol.  We also got fried chicken wings also greasy and yummy . Just what i wanted fresh/crispy. Chicken fried rice was as expected no complaints. Lastly the chilli chicken , which is why i said 3.5 and not 4. It was full of veggies barely any meat. Also was not spicey at all. But i guess its western chinese food and they know we cant handle spice lol"}
{"text":"First time I have ordered from this premise. Chicken balls were awesome and wings were very tasty. However, I was not impressed with the chicken fried rice was bland (only fried rice,chicken and tones of soy sauce) I expected some other stuff. The most disappointed dish was the Shanghai noodles, also bland and too oily. The total was $37.00, I paid cash and received a 10% discount, paid $33.30."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I live right around the corner and it's delicious Chinese food for an awesome price. I got the combination C which I never finish. It's fried rice with sweet and sour chicken balls, chicken chow min and an egg roll."}
