{"text":"went here for the chicken biryani. the rice and seasoning was excellent but the chicken was plain and the added on 15 minute wait time despite calling in earlier was a let down. if you're coming in for the biryani call ahead as its not always available and be prepared for the wait once you come by to receive your order."}
{"text":"My usual go to place for desi takeout used to be silver spoon but since their quality is consistently degrading I thought I'd try this place. Their Biryani is pretty good, tried the chicken one and its was a bit on the spicy side but that's how I like it so no complaints! The beef seekh kababs were definitely better than silver spoon  since they were at least soft. Naans were amazing! 

Overall not bad but what I'd like to mention was what made me give it 4 stars is the customer service, the young lady behind the counter was very nice and helpful. I wanted chicken karhai but they didn't have much left ( went there around 6:30 and they close at 8 so understandable) so she included whatever she had free of charge that was very sweet of her. Will surely return for Biryani and karhai and of course the naans"}
{"text":"Best food ever Always perfect and delicious every time i miss my moms food i go there and get some food :) all of the workers are very friendly I would recommend this place :) when you eat it you know the food is always freshly made and when you get it for take out they put always a big amount of food in the box . It's not a restaurant to sit but the takeout is amazing every time we ordered food they NEVER disappointed us. The chicken biryani I suggest."}
{"text":"If you want the taste of the authentic home cooked Pakistani food that your university roommate's mother used to send you in Tupperware, this is the place to go. Shaheen started cooking for small parties and her food was such a hit that she now caters for people's daily needs as well as parties of hundreds of people. 
The biryani, the chicken karahi, the nihari, the bhindi, the seekh kababs, the naan, the bun kabab.....all on point. I could go on. 
This is strictly take out, there is no seating...you go in, order off the freshly made buffet and leave with your (fairly cheap) meal. There is also some Indian groceries there as well as a halal butcher but the food is what you go for. 
And if you go after 6pm, then good luck, there is rarely any of the good stuff left. Everything is made fresh daily and if it runs out, well then, your loss."}
{"text":"Not a review just a tip.
This place is clean and staff is friendly and food is delicious and inexpensive.Their Veal Pulao on Thursdays is a hit!!They carry Pakistani grocery items as well.And have a meat shop."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Lots of flavour. The portions were generous and very inexpensive. Will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Ordered Chicken Biryani and Raita and honestly it was quite below expectation. The owner kept insisting it was fresh. Raita was rotten."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!  TAKEOUT ONLY.  

Located on a somewhat industrial strip, just south of Burnhamthorpe, is Shaheen.  It's across the street from Rogers TV and a coupla units North of Tremendous - the infamous, only almost-24hr Chinese restaurant in Mississauga.  If you blink, you will miss this place because their sign is not lit up!

Shaheen is a mini grocery store with a long takeout counter with approx. 10-12 different dishes, including a coupla desserts.  No drinks (chai, lassi) available.

I actually came here for the $4.99 Chicken Biryani (!!!), but they had ran out and it was approx. 5:30pm.  The girl behind the counter said that the biryani is usually gone by 5pm.  Apparently they also offer Veal Biryani - which I've never had - and it's supposed to be a bit spicier than the Chicken version.

I ordered the Chicken Karahi (med - $5.49) and girl *included* the Chana Masala so I can try it...at no cost!  Although I preferred the curry sauce of the Karahi, the Chana Masala were well cooked (tender) and had a nice kick to it.

After I check out their biryani, I'll definitely be writing an update, so look out for that!"}
{"text":"Catered food for an event and received multiple complaints from family and friends. We chose the 5 star menu for 60 people that consisted of chicken biryani, chicken korma, seekh kabobs, chana masala, tandoor naans, raita, salad and gulab jamun. 
To start the chicken biryani was too spicy to eat. We didn't ask for it to be spicy. It gave you heart burn right after consuming it. The seekh kabobs were bland and falling apart, the chana masala didn't taste fresh and chicken korma had way too much masala in it. The only good thing was the tandoor naans and gulab jamun. I was very disappointed with the food and also especially because our guests didn't get to enjoy it. 
I will never order from here again let alone recommend this place. The service initially provided was good but they couldn't provide good quality food which is the most important thing."}
{"text":"This is both a grocery store as well as a take out joint, my review will focus on the hot foods portion.

Shaheen seems to maintains high quality food at a mid-low price range. To be honest I really don't like the seekh kababs/tandoori chicken too much, however, both the chicken and veggie biryanis are amongst the BEST I have ever had and are about $5-$6 (oh boy the seasoning/spice is evenly distributed to perfection!). Likewise, the noodles and haleem they have are EXTREMELY good as well.

Unfortunately one issue my family and I have is that they (Shaheen) often seem to be out of certain food - we often drop by at around 5:30-6:00pm or so, and they are supposedly open until 8:00pm so I always found this bizarre.

Overall, I can vouch for the biryani/haleem/noodles and say they are totally worth trying. Just a fair warning though, the food is more on the spicy side!"}
