{"text":"I went there quite often now, I tried when they first opened, it was just another congee place, but i went back there again couple of months ago, the food was improved and they often have new dishes come out as specials of the week.  The service was always the best part and is still the same.  The staffs were really friendly and they do their best to ensure we are taken care of.  (they are really attentive, even better than major restaurants in the city!!!) Since several of my friends starting to eat healthier, we asked for less oil and salt.  When the food came out, it look like they didn't  reduce the oil, so my friend asked for a remake, the manager explained to us the difference between oily and saucy.  When we started to eat, he was right, it's not oily, it was just because the sauce that shine up the dish.  We had an awesome experience cause the staffs and their dedications to serve us the best.  I believed that they served everyone in the restaurant the same way.   Great Job, Congee Royal!!"}
{"text":"Congee Royal is good times.  It's located on the ground level of an office building facing Steeles.  It's hard to miss as there isn't any other food options right around it.  When I went for dinner in the middle of the week, there was plenty of seating and we were greeted by super friendly staff right away.   The menu is extensive and we ordered two carb dishes - a fried rice with spicy soft shell crab and a XO sauce rice noodle dish.  The fried rice was very very tasty, though there wasn't enough crab for the size of the dish.  I found it a bit oily, as was the rice noodle dish.  The rice noodle was not what I was expecting at it - it's pretty much mini 'cheung fun' fried up all together with not much else.  We had a mango dessert as well which was not as cold as I'd expect or as mango-y.    The staff try very hard to please, the prices are decent, the portions and variety are large.  All in all though, it's a good option for Chinese food and once a few kinks are worked out, it would be worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"The food here is so oily!  They told us that they can cook the food any way we like... Less salty... less oily... No... The food still came out extra oily and salty.  Monster sized portions however it doesn't make up for how oily the food tastes."}
