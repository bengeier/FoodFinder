{"text":"So. I wish very much that I could comment on just the food and be done with it. My opinion is that the food at Nawab Express on Avenue is.....okay. I agree with other people who posted here and elsewhere that the food is quite bland, and suitable for people who don't like spice (so, bland).  Portions were on the small side, which makes it relatively expensive for what you get. Unfortunately, customer service goes hand-in-hand with food when it comes to overall impression of a restaurant.  And customer service is where this restaurant falls short, in my view. I ordered a \"Dinner for 2\" off of the Foodora site. As instructed, I selected 1 meat dish and 1 veggie. I was surprised to receive a call from the restaurant, whereupon a gentleman informed me that I was not allowed to order the prawns.  He told me the prawns were a premium dish and insisted that I had to order something cheaper -  there was a \"glitch\" (his term), and he would not process the order. I then offered to pay to make up the cost difference, and he would not do it.  I am baffled as to why they would not honour an order (or, at the very least, accept additional payment for an upgraded order) that was made in good faith, and allowable through their partnership with Foodora. I understand that there may have been a miscommunication between the restaurant and Foodora, regarding what dishes are and are not included in the Dinner bundles. And if so, that's a shame - hopefully Nawab Express can rectify the situation going forward, as this clearly was a frustrating situation for them.  But the way it was handled in the moment was ridiculous. Grand scheme of things, this is nothing - not even cracking the Top 1,000 list of things that are annoying (I'd like to meet the person who has a bad restaurant experience live on their list - they must live a lovely life otherwise!). This \"nothing\", though, left me with a poor impression of the restaurant. I sent an email to the 2 contact addresses I could find on their site to explain the situation and to offer to connect if they wanted more details or had any questions, and received no response. I held off on posting this, as I wanted to give them a chance to reach out. They didn't. So, net takeaway is that this is a mediocre restaurant with poor customer service. We're spoiled for choice in Toronto when it comes to restaurants - Nawab Express on Avenue, in my opinion, is not worth seeking out."}
{"text":"They are new, but in the past couple weeks we've become their regulars:)
Saffron chicken is my 6 year old's fav!(not spicy).
Soups are great, butter chicken is great.
Whenever we decide to eat-in, service is quick and friendly. Love the fruit-infused water, Clair!
Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Ordered using Uber Eats. The food arrived on time. I had the butter chicken and lamb sliders with naan. Lamb sliders were great. Butter chicken was the best I have ever had. The price was reasonable. I would definitely eat from here again."}
{"text":"Food was very good. It was one of the best Paneer Tikka's I have ever had in Toronto. I am from India and it so much reminded of the food back home. The quantity was good and delivery was fast.

Overall a good find!"}
{"text":"TL;DR Bland food, deceitful practices, & a bad experience

Bland. That is the best way I can describe the food from this place. It was filling and it wasn't bad but it barely had any flavor. My \"Goan Coconut Curry\" with chicken which the guy behind the counter very highly recommended was marked with a hot pepper in the menu but it barely had a taste let alone any spiciness! My buddy got the Green Curry with chicken and it had even less flavor. Very disappointing.

Deceitful is how I would describe the person working there that night when I went in with a friend. He only decided to warn us at the end of our second order (we came in together but ordered separately)  that none of the dishes came with rice or naan bread and made no mention of the gargantuan size of the rice sides they give us. What a waste! We used one side of rice and barely touched the other between the two of us. I also threw in a naan bread in case the rice side was tiny and, again, totally went to waste because of the sheer size of the rice sides. Ugh, thanks for making us waste food and money, jerk!

It's astounding to me how they can have so many great reviews. Avoid this place"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS.  Best Indian delivery to date.  So good we ordered again the following week.

MUTTER PANEER (peas & cheese): Hits ALL the right spots. my all time fav Indian dish and they knocked it out of the park. Slightly sweet green peas with perfectly textured paneer and a savoury sauce worthy of soaking up every last drop with their mind-blowing butter naan. 

DAAL MAKHNI (brown lentil & red kidney beans): Out of this world delicious! My new fav daal of all time. So rich and savoury like gravy; this dish alone is dinner enough.

PALAK KOFTA (spinach & cheese dumplings in spinach sauce): Another instant hit. Different from the usual mixed veg kofta in red curry sauce, this dish was lighter and a welcome addition to the meal. (besides... it's spinach, so it has to be healthy, right.....?! lol)

BUTTER CHICKEN: my hubby's fav and he was in love at first bite. Literally everything you want when a serious, soul-wrenching Indian food craving hits hard and lightning fast.

LAMB VINDALOO (fiery lamb curry with Kashmiri chilies): If you like spice, order it *extra hot* - they won't disappoint. The spice was a bit much for my partner but was delightfully warm and tasty for my masochistic taste-buds.

GARLIC NAAN: Not the best garlic naan I've ever had.  Prob not worth the extra money.

BUTTER NAAN: Might have been a fluke alignment in the Universe, but the butter naan in our second delivery was like being struck by lightning and going straight to Naan-Heaven.  Literally have never had naan so soft and delicious before. Never expect to get it that fresh again, but it was a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence like seeing a giant shooting star streak across the sky on top of a mountain, or getting to touch a wild deer in a forest clearing at sunrise.

CHEESE NAAN: Tried it on a fluke and was blown away. Cheese and bread, how can you go wrong, right?  Ye gods, why have I never tried cheese naan before 2017?!  Why??!!!!!

MINT-CORIANDER CHUTNEY: Great flavour but smoother texture than what I'm used to.  Still essential.

TAMARIND CHUTNEY: Meh. Not sure why it's called tamarind chutney. Was not at all what I was expecting. Would not order again.

RAITA: Interesting spices. On the fence.  If you like the cool contrast, just go with the mint-coriander chutney instead.

We tried Nawab Express out of desperation after Madras Masala decreased their delivery area leaving us out in the cold.  Thank the sweet/fiery curry gods they did, or we never would have discovered Nawab Express.  Don't be fooled by the name, they are not actually any faster than any other Indian delivery spot but they are worth every minute of wait time between clicking \"place order\" and the heavenly moment your taste-buds simultaneously melt and explode."}
{"text":"Creamy butter chicken and delicious raita - highly recommend if you're looking for takeout or delivery! 

I ordered the dinner combo for 1 ($19.95) - this comes with the chef's appetizer (today was the vegetable pakora), a choice of entree (I chose the butter chicken), plain rice, and 2 naan bread. I also ordered the raita ($3.45) to pair nicely with the naan and butter chicken. First off, I thought it wouldn't be a lot of food and that it was expensive, BUT it is actually so much food! The entree is a really good size, lots of naan bread, and a huge container of raita! It was so delicious and everything is extremely rich in flavour. I love my butter chicken really creamy and on the sweet side - Nawab Express's butter chicken was exactly that! The raita has also a great hints of parsley and cucumber flavour. If you order this combo along with another appetizer or entree with another naan or rice, it could easily be a meal for two.  

The restaurant itself seats a maximum of 12 people at a time, so it is more for take-out and delivery! The service is pretty average and the wait time is around 10 minutes. 

I'm excited to get hungry again to eat the leftovers I have from this meal - so delicious! 

Note: They don't deliver on the weekdays, only weekends."}
{"text":"This place provides Canadian made poutine for those who want to feel the warmth of a good savoury Indian style poutine. Ya man this place is for you ma Indian or non Indian friend. Get in maaaaaa belly. Bring yo wife bring yo kids bring yo dog. Bless up my food snobs."}
{"text":"Ordered a 4 person combo with appetizer which amounted to over $110, tbh it's more  expensive than it should be. I've had much better and for cheaper and they don't deliver.

Our food was delivered by (Just eat) to us without rice. Now, if you've had Indian food you know rice is integral. Am I suppose to eat this saag paneer like a soup??? I was told there was a mistake and our rice went elsewhere. To make matters worse the \"manager\" told me she was \"sorry\" and would give me complimentary rice on my next order. I don't think she quite understood the math, how is it complimentary if I paid for the rice the first time and didn't get it. I asked for a refund and they could take back the uneaten food which was now cold and worthless without rice. I had to call several times as she said she would call me back in 2 minutes, obviously never intending to.

I tried to explain myself in various ways and there was zero comprehension. She refused to deliver us rice which would have been the easiest resolution. 

They took money for services they did not provide. I would stay clear of this place. 

A shining example on how to lose a good customer."}
{"text":"Delicious, flavourful, healthy Indian food is hard to find at restaurants, but Nawab has it mastered.  Our favourites are the garlic veggie balls, mumbai chicken wings and the kale salad.  We look forward to trying everything that this vast menu has to offer."}
{"text":"Amazing, best Indian i've had in Toronto, we used Uber eats for delivery was smooth as ever!!

This is what i ordered: (see picture attached)

Butter Chicken Pizza - 8.5/10 - crust could have been a little better.

Chicken Naan Wrap - 9/10 - first time i had something like this was delicious and the veggies blended well with the chicken.

Tandoori Lamb Chops - 9.5/10 - Expensive but fully worth it well worth it, best lamb I've had.

Chicken Biriyani - 9/10 - very authentic tasting! I got mild cant handle the spice.

Chicken Saffron - 11/10 - kept the best for last the best indian dish i have ever had, and that is indeed saying a lot, i think i have a new addiction. Just simply put - Amazing"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this place the other night when my first-ever Indian food craving wouldn't go away. Having some spare time at work allowed me to grab a bite to eat.

This quiet, mainly take out, storefront had one lady who admitted to being quite new to the place working in front with 1-2 cooks staffing the kitchen. 

Not being overly fond of spice, I kept it safe with a butter chicken combo for 1; which included, butter chicken, rice, an appetizer and naan bread. The portion was huge and was easily enough for two dinners.

In terms of the food, the rice was flavourful. The butter chicken was VERY mild. The naan delicious and chefs appetizer a pleasant surprise (it was also very mild). Price point somehow climbed to a number which I would not consider cheap but considering it kept me sated for two days I'm not complaining. Looking forward to trying other items on their menu in the weeks to come.

Good for: satisfying Indian food cravings, quick bites, and those who don't like spice."}
{"text":"Great Indian takeout.  Dinner for 2 is a great deal and can actually feed my family including 2 kids.  Butter Chicken is excellent."}
{"text":"After a particularly unpleasant day (I had to fast and let's leave it at that), I was in the mood for something really hearty and flavorful. Indian food generally fulfills both those criteria, so I decided to give Nawab Express a shot.

Their extensive menu was a little daunting but we finally decided to order:

Lamb Kadai (\"Lamb cooked with tomoto. Onion with green chilli and ginger sauce\"): I'd never heard of this dish before, so I felt somewhat compelled to try it. The lamb is very tender and the sauce is plentiful, but there was just something a little off about the whole thing. It almost had a bit of a burnt flavor to it. There's a hint of spiciness, too, though I could've used more heat. I wouldn't say I disliked this dish in any way, but it certainly didn't blow me away.

Mutter Paneer (\"Green peas and paneer cooked in a mild, flavourful sauce\"): Again, this was fine but hardly memorable or special. And when they say mild, they're really not kidding, as this one was totally devoid of spice. It wasn't terribly flavorful, either. Honestly, I took one small helping of this one and left the rest for my dining companion."}
{"text":"They have good menu options. This is good for take out food as they have only one/two tables. Only Street parking available. I liked Garlic Veg Balls. And Biriyani was okay too."}
{"text":"We used Nawab's Catering Services for one of our pre-wedding events and it was a phenomenal experience. We worked with Alfie to find a menu that fit within our budget but still gave us the best service and food! Alfie gave us recommendations on food/menu items and they turned out amazing, all of our guests were thrilled with the food quality.  

Alfie was so accommodating and willing to work with us even though we contacted him only a month before our event which took place on Canada Day! We are so happy we chose a smaller company to cater our pre-wedding event!

For a small additional charge they were able to send Santosh to help us serve on the day of the event.  Santosh was kind and very helpful. He took care of everything, including keeping the food warm, we didn't even need to think of the food or serving. You can also request chaffing dish rentals. 

Tip: Order the garlic veg balls, vegetarians and non-vegetarians all enjoyed them!"}
{"text":"WARNING: do not use online ordering for this restaurant. It does not work. It took my payment but did not inform the restaurant. When I called irate after an hour the place said 'oh sorry we are having issues with online ordering.' Then he said, 'Get a refund!' Yikes! He said he'd get the order out in 20 minutes and reduced delivery from $6 to $2. Big deal. I like the good here and the concept is innovative but this misleading service is unpardonable. The takeout better be good."}
