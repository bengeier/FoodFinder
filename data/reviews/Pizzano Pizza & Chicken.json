{"text":"My family have been loyal pizzano customers for years. Their pizza is great, affordable, and the delivery fee is very cheap.  They do tend to forget the pizza dip on a few rare occasions, so just let them know on the phone to make sure that you get everything you want.  You can pay using your debit/credit card as well if they deliver to your home.  I'll keep buying from here as long as I'm in this part of Mississauga! :)"}
{"text":"Pizzano was my go-to pizza joint back in the day. For almost 3 years, this place has satisfied my pizza cravings. This is no gourmet pizza or anything but for what it's worth, they are definitely overachievers.

This is a whole-in-the-wall, local grub, take out kinda joint. The few middle-eastern, Indian topping options give this place a unique ethnic flair. They have some of the most fun and ridiculous promotions like the one where the time you call determines the price you pay for the pizza (what???). Trust me, it's a lot of fun! LOL Unlimited toppings is also their specialty and they deliver on that offer. There are no hesitations if you wanted 4 kinds of chicken on your pizza or if you wanted everything and the kitchen sink.

You wouldn't expect premium service for the price you're paying but these guys really do listen. If you want your pizza half sauced on each side with extra thin crust and extra greasy these guy will try to accommodate. Their wings are also surprisingly good. Big, fat and juicy! Again you can pretty much ask for it how you like it.

The dough is always fresh, doughy, crispy and extra thin(that's how I like it). The toppings, cheese and sauces always tastes fresh and well balanced.

I think this is one of the few hidden gems in the west. I do stop by from time to time whenever I head out west."}
{"text":"Really good place for great tasting pizza. Tried the tandoori chicken with jalapeno, out of this world. Definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Really surprised actually. The reviews are all correct, pizza place is well worth it. The pizza crust is so soft and fresh. It has a deep dish like taste but not quite..adequete amount of cheese which i love. I had half white sauce half tomato sauce, you cant see the difference but can taste it.
Toppings were tandorri chicken and italian sausage. I didnt like the toppings much to be honest. The italian sausage tasted like chicken hot dog and the tandoori chicken tasted like the packaged chicken you buy in the grocery store. 
The chicken wings are huge and juicy af! Very well seasoned ...crunchy in the right parts and so juicy best wongs frm a pizza spot ive ever had.
Customer Service is awesome as well...i called in for a pick up order and changed my mind 3 times but he didnt flutter was super nice and helpful. 
Ill definitely be back
New regular spot ..i think so!"}
{"text":"This places makes the most yummiest white sauce pizzas. Their chicken pizza is more flavourful over their beef.. A word of caution though try to place the order in person rather then on the phone if possible.. I've had a lot of mishaps with my on phone orders almost every time.."}
