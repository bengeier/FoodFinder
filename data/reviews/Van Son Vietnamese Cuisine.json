{"text":"Great tasty food! I would eat here every day for a week. Had the lemongrass chicken and subbed pork for veggie rolls. Service was very friendly and they were ready with suggestions (taro bubble tea hit the spot). 
The ambiance is also nice and it's very clean to all appearances. I'd come again."}
{"text":"Full menu with wide variety of Vietnamese food.  Pho and Vietnamese Sub plus stir fry, rice and much more.  I love their stir fry noodle and also sweet and sour fish soup.  Price is average, not expensive.  Tasty good, comfy environment and free parking."}
{"text":"We eat a lot in the area and notice this location was getting renovated and new ownership. We decide to give it a try. Good sized portions and there price a completive with other Vietnamese restaurants.  One thing we really liked is they have there free own parking lot. There are other Vietnamese restaurants close by but packing is always a challenge. The staff had energy and always around checking in on us and others. Will be back soon when in the area."}
{"text":"I recently discovered Van Son. Nice and clean inside, with friendly service. The menu is extensive but I've only tried 2 things: The shrimp salad rolls (#2) and the satay peanut beef noodle soup (#31B). I can't remember the last time I had a good salad roll in Calgary. These were freshly made and expertly packed with a decent amount of ingredients inside - the wrapper was soft so you can tell they were made upon order and not made in advance like most places. The real show-stopper is the soup! The broth is flavourful without being overly salty, lots of noodles, lots of beef, and the herbs and beansprouts that come alongside the soup are fresh. The regular size is a big portion - on my third time there, I ordered the large and barely made it through! I'll be back here for sure."}
{"text":"Come here if you want to experience true authentic Vietnamese dishes with spot on taste.  Service was fast and super friendly.  Owners and staffs were awesome and happy. Open and well lit decor. The place has no food smell like other Asian restaurants."}
{"text":"Used to go to this location before the renos. Miss the pink walls (haha) but the food is still good and the staff is very friendly and efficient. Just today I was in to grab a quick takeout order and while I waited they sat me in a booth and made sure I had a full water glass, very polite and kind staff. The atmosphere is friendly, it's clean, and the food is good. Nothing to complain about really. There are a few things I miss from the old menu but the new menu tastes just fine. Like another reviewer said, they're light on the spicy stuff, but hot sauce is provided for those of us who like more kick. I'll be back, as always."}
{"text":"Won't bother going back... Nine people at our table (we had reserved so they knew we were coming). When the food was brought our, two of our party remained unserved until they actually called the waitress over to ask about their order. She hadn't even noticed that there were orders missing so they had to wait. 

One of our party didn't even get what she ordered and there was no offer to replace her order with the correct one or to comp. her meal. 

Also no mention ANYWHERE on the menu that they put peanuts on EVERYTHING... One of our party was allergic and had to send the meal back. 

Food was okay... Standard fare for that kind of restaurant, but a place to avoid if you're going to be more than 4 people at a table."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  Great service and people.  The music is also an added bonus.  We ordered number 64 and 3.  Very tasty and for a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time yesterday. I was pleasantly surprised. Nice clean, modern atmosphere. The food was very good. We had vermicelli bowl with various meat & beef soup. Dessert (deep fried bananas & ice cream) was delicious!
We will go there again soon."}
{"text":"A great Vietnamese place with TONS of menu items. Really something here to satisfy everyone. The service is pretty average and mostly friendly but the food has never disappointed. The restaurant has been renovated and is casual but nice."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff and outstanding food! My favourite item is the #40 curry chicken soup. It has such a rich flavour. Excellent spring rolls and salad rolls, too!"}
{"text":"Pho is ok, the broth is ok, not bad not great. Too many noodles in the soup. Could use some more vegetables in the soup. The tofu is cooked ok, not great and could have been prepared better. 

Ordered the shrimp spring rolls, they were good but aren't served with peanut sauce. Would have tasted better if they were served with peanut sauce. 

Vermicelli is good but not the best we have had. Tracy ordered the sandwich with lemongrass chicken and she said it was very good."}
{"text":"As a resident of the south end of the city,  I rarely dine out north of downtown. I saw this restaurant on the corner when I was driving down 16th Avenue, and considering my enjoyment of Vietnamese food decided to check it out. That was 18 months ago. Since then I have made Van Son a regular dining spot whenever I'm in the north.

They have a large assortment of dishes that can be prepared gluten-free, without compromising the taste and texture. Their portions are large, but their prices are not. The staff is friendly and welcoming too, offering fast and courteous service.  

If you enjoy Asian cuisine, I'd highly recommend stopping in and checking them out."}
{"text":"We have friends who live around SAIT and normally we go to the Noodle House right across the street. We decided to try something different and I am so happy we did. 

 A while back I had some pho (from Bolsa in the South somewhere) and it was the best pho I had tried. It was so different from other pho, considering it had a more peanut taste and was a creamy orange-red colour. Well, I found another place that makes it like this!!! It is the peanut satay beef pho!!! I seriously can not get enough of this stuff. It is way more spicy than its non-peanut counterpart. I will never go back.
The best part about this place, is that my boyfriend prefers the non-peanut pho, and they offer both. 
We also like to try appetizers at Vietnamese places and the deep fried wontons were ridiculously good!!
It was one of the cleaner pho places in Calgary too. I really, really enjoyed this place and will definitely be going back :)"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately won't be returning as a customer due to the other options in the city that have better pho. The restaurant itself is nice and spacious. It's also very clean. I ordered Pho Tai (pretty basic dish offered at most Vietnamese cuisines) and the noodles were really stiff.  Maybe it's just me but I prefer my noodles cooked softer. The soup was really bland -- I guess it would be considered healthy because it tasted more like a light chicken stock. My boyfriend got Pho as well and wasn't pleased either. Maybe their other dishes are more spectacular but this was my experience :/"}
{"text":"I often order take out from Van Son, the chicken/spring roll/vermicelli bowl. However when I ordered it yesterday the meat was so dry I couldn't even eat it. So I just ate the rice and spring rolls. The food is mediocre."}
{"text":"PROS: friendly owners. Not many Vietnamese restaurants owners don't really talk to you u less u are Vietnamese yourselves (just an observation). THEY HAVE GLUTEN FREE OPTIONS. they have spring rolls with rice paper and they make sure u got the right order if you have allergies.


CONS: they need chili oil on their tables instead of just  sriracha."}
{"text":"This place is really good, fresh ingredients, super nice staff...the number 64 is very delicious"}
{"text":"I came here just as they were opening on the Saturday morning after St. Patrick's Day. Having partied a bit too hard the previous night, I felt the only cure was a good bowl of pho. I ventured away from my usual go-tos and decided on Van Son after a quick search on Yelp. 

I had my usual pho tai in regular size, while my hubby had their ultimate vermicelli bowl. My sister also had pho tai but in large size. The broth was flavorful but not hot enough. I also felt the quality of the beef was not top notch, but at least they gave plenty of it. 

I was impressed with the attentiveness of the service and the speed. I didn't finish my pho but my sister was satisfied with her large bowl. 

I'm glad to say I left restaurant feeling less regretful of my life's decisions. I would definitely try Van Son another time but maybe with a more sober mind."}
{"text":"Very tasty food. Particularly happy that they have gluten free options including spring rolls! The staff is friendly too."}
{"text":"Van Son stands out as a Vietnamese restaurant that not only serve fresh and clean tasting Pho but where staff are pleasant, attentive and willing to make practically any modification you ask for. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best pho in Calgary.

The soups are all amazing and the spring rolls are also very tasty."}
{"text":"I always find their food to be amazing taste and quality. Service is very fast and decent priced! 

Recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Quick service and friendly staff. The food however leaves alot to be desired. The menu offers all the usual items as expected, but everything I have tried has been bland or not cooked to its optimal doneness. I recommend a pass on this establishment."}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Calgary town for sure. Hands down!! We traveled from America to Banff and stopped by for dinner. Their food and services are great, authentic and quality Vietnamese food! And trust me when I said it's good Viet food because I'm Vietnamese and very picky at my Viet food lol.Pho, noodle stir fried and family meals were really delicious !!
 Great and fast service ! Definitely  recommend for anyone who is looking for delicious and authentic Vietnamese food !"}
{"text":"I like this place. It's a staple restaurant in Chestermere and it hits the spot every time. The pho is good. It's not the best I've had, but I wouldn't turn  down a suggestion to go there. 

I do need to venture into other items in the menu. I'm usually pretty bad for not doing that when I find something I'm good with or I'm craving something in particular. 

With all that said, service there is really good. Those guys work really hard and are friendly. Also, free wifi. That's awesome because I usually pop in there when I want to get away, treat myself to a meal and read. 

Thumbs up. Definitely a good stop in Chestermere."}
{"text":"I stopped in here while running errands and wanted something to eat. Had the peanut satay soup and some spring rolls. The rolls felt a bit \"store bought\" but I did enjoy the soup. The broth was rich and flavourful. I liked how the meat was still rare once it hit the table before infusing with the broth. The noodles were a tad over cooked but would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I am a fairly regular customer here and the staff know me by first name. Vincent, who is always there working hard and giving stellar customer service, was the reason why I became a regular. The other staff are exceptional as well, but he was my first impression. I tend to always get the beef and vermicelli with GF spring rolls, but I've also had the rare beef soup. Great food, awesome service, worth the visit. This explains why they are able to have two locations."}
{"text":"Van Son just had their grand opening on last weekend.  They took over Vietnam Palace Grill - I miss it already!!  For their grand opening special, you get a spring roll for each person - which is a great deal!  Their spring rolls taste good and a fair size.  The restaurant has undergone a total renovation.  Those pink walls have been replaced with beige, white and black colours.  There are more tables & booths in the restaurant.  The washroom is completely new.  Huge menu.

Now for the food.  We ordered the following:
#31 - Satay Beef Noodle Soup - good broth but where is the satay taste?  I'm missing that great peanutty, satay broth and where's the spice?  The soup just needs to have more flavour.  Lots of rice noodles for a regular bowl of $9.95.  Big plate of fresh bean sprouts, mint leaves, lime and thai red chilli peppers came with this order.  Add this to your soup.  The beef needs to be cut more thinly as I found my beef all curled up in my broth.
#38 - Rice Noodle, Vegetables, Shrimp, Crabstick & Chicken in Soup - For $10.95 - regular bowl.  The soup again needs more flavour.
#16 - Vermicelli topped with Satay Beef and Spring Rolls - For $10.50.  Again, not enough satay spice.  Need to kick it up a notch!  Miss the Vietnam Palace Grill's Satay Beef Bun - so good!
#23 - Rice Crepes with Pork Sausage - For $9.95 - Interesting dish - rice crepes that kind of stuck together and big round pieces of pork sausage, topped with chopped mint leaves, boiled bean sprouts and some other garnish, with a condiment of fish sauce.  Pour the sauce over the dish.  Not bad.  Need hot sauce (thank goodness, this  was available in a squeegee bottle on your table).  

We also ordered the 3 bean coconut drink - nice and refreshing for a hot summer's day - for $5.50.  

All in all, my common thread in here is that the food needs to have more flavour, more spice .if the food is rated \"hot\" with a chili icon on their menu."}
