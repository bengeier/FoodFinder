{"text":"Small menu, big flavor! I came here with a friend and she got the beef noodle soup combo and I got the egg roll w/ grilled beef on noodles. Except I didn't want any noodles, they were more than happy to accommodate my needs and swapped it out for rice. The rice dish was delicious and so was the pho! 

While we were eating, 2 employees came over to check on us and the food, which isn't typical of a Vietnamese restaurant. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Finally some great pho is Surprise!! Owner was very nice. Store was clean and the pho was great!!"}
{"text":"Went there and i saw cockroaches on the floor ants on the table hair in my soup.u can see in the kitchen and they dont wear gloves wont eat there again"}
{"text":"THis place is absolutely delicious. The pho was fresh and the spring rolls were amazing. My husband got the number 6 and the chicken was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of flavoring. I would come here again and again. Kinda of a little hole in the wall type of feel but service was super fast and although the owner was a little awkward, he was very nice and perceptive to our needs."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first because i had tried Saigon Kitchen sometime back and didnt like it at all. I decided to try this place because my husband loves Pho and hadn't found a good place since a fishing trip that took him through Reno. 
You walk in  and the place is small which isnt a big deal for me. Husband got pho and i got the grilled beef with noodles and we ordered some egg rolls. We took  a seat, wasn't busy and within a few minutes the gentleman comes out with the egg rolls and instructs us to roll the egg roll in the lettuce with the other veggies and dip in the sauce. I thought it a little strange at first but when i tried it..it was really tasty.
I was pleased with my grilled beef and noodles. It was very good. Husband was very happy to have found a place that has good pho. We will definitely be back and next time I  think I will even try pho."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great price. My husband got the classic beef pho, and I got the chicken pho. Hubby said the beef pho was delicious and had two kinds/cuts of meat inside it, which enhanced the flavor. The chicken was cooked well, and they provided a sort of lemon juice side that complemented the flavors of the chicken broth well. I personally put everything offered (lemon juice, mung bean sprouts, basil, jalapeños) in my bowl. Definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"Small strip-mall restaurant. Amazing and very fresh Vietnamese food, mostly pho. Springroll peanut sauce is best we've had. Portions are generous. Good service. Wish they'd filter their water and replace TV with slides of Viet Nam and soft instrumental Asian music!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant last week. The menu is simple which is a nice change from places that overload their menu with too many options. Staff was very friendly. Food was fresh and very tasty. This will become a regular lunch spot for me and my husband."}
{"text":"Great pho, the beef noodle's broth is so delicious. Wonderful comfort food especially after our road trip. We came quite late and the owner stayed and did not rush us at all."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Great place with a good Pho menu. Wrapping the egg rolls with fresh veggies and sauces is so good. Found my new fav place for Vietnamese food! Pho with great tasting broth and ingredients made it even better"}
{"text":"Being from a place where you can find pho on every corner, I have pretty high standards. This place is good. The broth is full of flavor and the owner is awesome! He is so friendly and goes out of his way to make sure you are beyond satisfied. The menu is simple but it has everything you need when you are looking for a hot bowl of pure deliciousness!"}
{"text":"A wonderful dining experience of deliciousness.  Nvam Pho is on our regular go to places"}
{"text":"My hubs & I came in here since it was a cooler day and I wanted soup. I got the #3 small beef pho combo, it came with a spring rolls and 2 eggrolls. It was very good. My hubs ordered the #5 pork chop with steamed rice. He kept raving about the flavor of the pork. It came with two and he usually will eat one and save the other for lunch the next day. He said they were so delish. He didn't stop eating until they were both gone. The service was great and the owner came over to check on us. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is going to explode once word gets out how great it is. Came for the pho, which was great, but have been back 3 times this week for their Bahn Mi sandwiches. I love sandwiches, and I have to say these are the best ones in town! The kids love the rest of the items on the menu they have tried, but I just cannot break away from these crazy good sandwiches. Give em a try, well worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place , great Pho , great customer service, great prices! The to go Pho spot in surprise!"}
{"text":"First time eating Pho. Loved it! It's hearty and filled me up. Will be back again to try all other dishes."}
{"text":"Delicious, fast and greatly priced. I craved Vietnamese food all through my pregnancy so when I arrived 5 minutes before closing I asked if it was still ok to make an order to go and they said of course. They had it ready quickly and made me a really happy pregnant girl. I will be going back no doubt"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and was very pleased with the food. It is a small space and you order at the counter. You then sit and they bring the food out to you table. I had the beef pho combination which started with a crispy egg roll and a salad roll. It was nice to get the rolls without having to order a full appetizer. The food was very good and the price very reasonable. The owner was very attentive.  It is not a hight end dining experience but the food was very good so it a great addition to the area. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Pho' was amazing! The staff was so friendly! And, the serving size is fantastic for what you pay. Definitely our favorite pho' place in Surprise!"}
{"text":"The food is well worth your visit.I had the small beef bowl and that was even big. You should tell them it's your first time and see how well they treat you. Let everyone know if you go eat here,honest post."}
{"text":"Enjoyed large bowl of pork & shrimp Pho for $9.  Broth was tasty, pork slices were tender and the 3 shrimp with noodles were good and filling.  Ordered the spring rolls, the skins were thick and tough to eat.  I've had better.  Great place to catch a quick Pho bowl at a reasonable price.  I believe they offer small bowls but we were not aware until we noticed someone having one.Food is fresh and place was clean.  Small place with menu on wall, no frills. They also make smoothies.  Chef deliveries bowls on a noisy cart.  He also collects dishes on same cart.  Wheels could use some oiling. Judge Judy was on the TV.  Very entertaining!"}
{"text":"Been twice with different friends to check out the quality, quatity, cleanliness and service. I enjoyed the service and the food. Great taste in their pho and pork chop. Mango bubble tea to go! Yum!"}
{"text":"Best Pho in the west valley! Love the way your server/owner will visit your table to share with you the best way to enjoy your egg rolls and make certain you are familiar with eating Pho. Always friendly, always fast. We've eaten here once a month since they opened, even ordered  to go. Always perfect! Favorite dishes- Shrimp Pho, egg rolls and spring rolls."}
{"text":"Pho was ok. I was shocked by the $0.75 take out charge. I understand they may be trying to recoup the paper cost of the containers but when I don't dine in I'm not taking a table, using supplies in the restroom, no drink refills, no chemical cost for my dishes, no labor cost to wash my dishes, etc. Makes absolutely no sense and they do not tell you about the charge ahead of time."}
{"text":"Been looking for a good Pho spot since arriving from So. Calif.   This has not disappointed.  Clean, personable, easy to read menu & great sports watching monitors. Service is quick, food is consistently delicious . Herbs, sprouts,sauces and limes are fresh.  We look to our weekly \"pho fix\"."}
{"text":"My first time here with 2 others.  We are experienced in Asian restaurants.  My standard for comparison for Pho is Miss Saigon in Tucson (Campbell/Speedway) It was ok but consomé/broth lacked depth of flavor.  It comes (pho tai) raw beef that is cooked in the broth and also a striated roast beef that was tough and almost impossible to eat. They have been open for five weeks and are hiring.  It is a better option than Saigon Kitchen, but looking forward to PT noodles"}
{"text":"I'm waiting for this restaurant to get more established before we return. Our Pho was warm and not hot. The spring rolls looked and felt as if they were prepared hours before. Then finally, I had to recheck my order after I paid because the cashier spoke so low (like the lady on Seinfeld). I had to say \"excuse me\" many times because I could not hear him. Just in case you were wondering he was Caucasian so it was not a language barrier. Pros: it is family friendly, fast service, and in Surprise!"}
{"text":"Good food.  The Pho was definitely on point along with the spring rolls.  I did enjoy that part.  
Although the food was great the environment was not.  When you first walk in you notice a temp change and humidity lingering in the air.   I ask very nicely if they could possible cool it down in there because I was already literally having to wipe my forehead with napkins and I haven't even had my Pho yet! They responded with \"its Arizona it's always hot.\" The management and owners should want their guests to eat comfortably unfortunately this was not the case.   If you go here just know they won't use there AC even if you ask.   
No AC and a hot bowl of Pho = no fun."}
{"text":"Nothing but good things to say about this place.I was greeted as soon as I walked in the door. I walked up to the counter, ordered my beef Pho the #1, filled my drink at the fountain and my Pho was already sitting at the table, steaming hot. The basil and bean sprouts were fresh and there was plenty of beef in my bowl. The workers were attentive and fast moving. The place was spotlessly clean and there was a steady stream of patrons coming in-always a good sign. My main reason for coming was because I was looking for a good bowl of Pho and other Yelp reviewers gave it a thumbs up and I couldn't agree more. I'll be back to try other items. I also got a very loud thank you on my way out."}
{"text":"Amazing PHO!!  I had never had this before and didn't know what to expect but now I am craving it again and will get again soon.  We called to place an order to pick up and they said it would be ready in 5 minutes!!!  Fantastic!!"}
{"text":"The pho wasn't bad. The rice dish was ok. I prefer PT noodle down the street. Service is much better there. Menu is on a screen behind the counter. Being our first time there, we didn't know. We sat down and waited for 2 more people in our group. The guy told us where the menu was and not more than 1 minute later asked us to order so the kitchen can start it. We literally just sat down, I have little ones and it takes a minute to settle in. We told him, we weren't ready to order. Again, 1 minute later.. he told us to order. At this point we felt rushed. So we ordered. Food came quick. Again, food wasn't bad hence the 2 stars. But I'd rather go to a different place for same quality of food but with better service. I'm not coming back here again."}
{"text":"I live in FL., the last time I was in town my sister took me here. It was amazing. So I had to go back again now that I am here visiting again. It is still so good. The food is fresh and delicious. The owner is very welcoming and accommodating, the restaurant itself though humble is very clean. Next time I am in town I will definitely be back. I ordered the spring rolls and beef and noodle bowl, craveable for sure."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see VNam Pho open in Surprise.  Really wanted it to become my \"Go-To\" spot since it's in the neighborhood.  Tried it tonight and while it was good, it was shallow on flavor.  Flavor is the name of the game when it comes to food.  I cook. I watch Food Network.  The key is seasoning and that seems to be lacking here.  Sad.  Because they have everything else right.  The veggies and herbs to add to the Pho were beautifully fresh, the food was hot upon delivery.  (Don't know why this is so difficult for so many establishments.  Hot food SHOULD be served hot!)  

So yes, I'm glad they are here and I wish them much success.  I will be supporting them.  It just won't be with the frequency I had hoped for earlier."}
{"text":"Delicious noodle bowl with pork. Staff was friendly and helped me eat the food properly! Location is clean and large menu. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time and it was awesome.  Very simple menu so be quick.  Only #1 thru #12.  We all picked something differrent and we all traded some, everyone was happy and ended up full.  I have found my Vietnamese fix in Surprise."}
{"text":"Not impressed.. The menu is extremely limited. The spring rolls are 7.00 and are loaded with lettuce. The lettuce is wilted ,as are the veggies with the pho. 16.00 for spring rolls and a small bowl of pho is too much , for this kind of quality. Go up the street, the food is way better."}
{"text":"The staff and owners are very nice but the Pho is very, very bland and the beef isn't the best quality.  I guess for a cheap bowl of Pho it's not bad but there's so many better options in the area now."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff that helps you learn about the proper way of eating egg rolls and pho. Loved the lesson and made the flavors come out even more. We shall be back!"}
{"text":"Poor presentation of Vietnamese food. The pho I ordered was very salty. The basil that they provided was wilted and sprouts it looks like are days old. I feel like they reusing leftovers on the sides. This my last time eating here."}
{"text":"Best Pho on the west side of the valley. Check out their Pho combos - perfect amount of Pho, a spring roll and two crispy egg rolls. But even better is their homemade Hawaiian shaved ice. Make sure to try the taro ice with condensed milk, coconut and banana!"}
{"text":"One of the best Pho I ever had and that is sayin alot because I use to live in California and I ate pho all the time."}
{"text":"I work in San Jose California, and have tried a lot of restaurants out there! AND I WILL SAY!! That this Restaurant is the BEST!! San Jose California Pho restaurants SUCK!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness... this is exactly what we needed on this hot summer day! The whole family LOVED it, and the owners were so nice! We didn't get pho this time, but we're still super happy with our choices. The kiddos shared the egg roll and rice noodles bowl (the portions are large, even for being \"adult size\"). Hubs got the grilled chicken and rice noodles, and I got the shrimp and rice noodles. The ingredients taste super fresh and the flavors were so light and amazing. You really can't go wrong with anything here. Also, do yourself a favor and get the mango shaved ice... you can thank me later!  We will DEFINITELY be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Different Vietnamese flavors compared to other Vietnamese in surprise. By far most authentic in town. It seemed owners are still adjusting and figuring out the flow of customers. The shrimp pho I had was tasty and delicious. There is not much of a selection of menu items, and they did not have grilled chicken. I would give it a 5 if the fluidity of ordering food was easier."}
{"text":"I'm sooo excited to have a delicious pho place right down the street!  A tiny hole in the wall,  cute and clean.  They have a small menu which is just perfect.  I had the beef pho and substituted Tofu for the beef.  My boyfriend had the egg rolls. Both dishes were super delicious and large portions. I think it was the owner behind the counter,  he was very friendly.  I will be a regular here for sure."}
{"text":"I made a last minute decision to go for pho. I yelped and found this place. Place was very clean and bright. I got my order very quickly which was a surprise. I was still getting settled at my table. I ordered the Pork/Shrimp pho. It was wonderfully delicious! The broth was nicely seasoned. I ate everything! I will definitely come back. It's in a great location. Lots of parking. Thank you Yelp!"}
{"text":"I felt the need to update my review because after the owner of this place commented on my not so favorable review, it needs to be more descriptive to help people understand that just because the owners of any place contact you about a negative review, it doesn't always mean it's worth changing it because it still is what it is. With that said, this place is not worth coming to. The portions and proportions are a joke. The menu isn't very diverse at all and reading it should be a strong indication how inauthentic this place it. Their portions are lacking and the one bowl that actually offers variety like well done flank, beef balls, tendon, tripe gives you small pieces with not so fresh quality. The broth itself tastes dirty. This place feels like a copycat pho place that way toned down to appeal to a much more bland and not adventurous audience. It's \"safe\" for those who think they want to try an ethnic cuisine but don't want to get too deep into it. 

There are many other places that are cheaper and much better flavor quality than this place. If it means anything coming from an Asian who grew up on pho among many other types of authentic Asian cuisines, I would say skip this place and drive another 10-15 mins to find another place more authentic that is a little bit bigger, doesn't feel so cramped, has a better overall menu and just simply a better representation of good, authentic pho."}
{"text":"Highly recommend, first time eating pho and it was excellent  order the beef pho combo"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the experience was fun. The gentleman who took our order stopped by our table to give us pointers on how to make our eating experience the best , I'm going back!"}
{"text":"My kids and i love the taro boba drink! 
amount of food is worth every penny! delicious :)"}
{"text":"Ok, if you want simple Vietnamese food, this is your place.  And it's priced right! 

Pho and bun and Vietnamese coffee.  That's all you need.

I had the traditional pork bun aka vermicelli #7 with egg rolls.  Simple, lots of noodles and the best part was the grilled pork that had a slight lemongrass taste - delicious.  

Vietnamese coffee? Oh yes.  It's a strong AF.  And sweet.  Thank you.

This is not your fancy smchancy restaurant. Yeah, the decorating is simple, but what do you expect for these prices? 

I also like how this was a family owned placed...it's refreshing to see in the the sea of crappy corporate style restaurants (aka Macayos, T.G.I. Friday's, outback).

Go here to get your Vietnamese fix."}
{"text":"I grew up with Vietnamese food. I am from San Jose where there are Vietnamese restaurants on every corner. Now this place is okay. The menu is small but nice. The waitstaff is nice. The prices are low. Now onto the bad part of this place. The most important part of any Pho dish is the broth. The broth is just plain bland. It's not bad but it definitely is not good. Maybe I caught it on a bad day. I can't be sure but knowing that two other Vietnamese restaurants are close by, I won't be returning to this restaurant. 

*edited: The beef in the beef pho is low quality and not thinly sliced"}
{"text":"Stopped by Vietnam Pho for a quick lunch and was not disappointed.  Kind of a warm day so I ordered the Egg Roll Bun at the counter.  Very friendly staff.  The owner took my order and even gave me a jovial lesson in the correct pronunciation of the food items in Vietnamese.  The place is small but clean and the service was quick and efficient.  My lunch came out promptly and was delicious.  The thin slices of pork were tender and the flavor was excellent.  Can't wait to try the Seafood Pho next time.  I'm sure it will be soon!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the portions were large. The beef was overcooked and the spring rolls were chewy."}
{"text":"If you like Pho and aren't looking for ambience, this is your spot!

Situated in a strip mall, it has no wait staff. All dishes are pictured on a board and you tell them what you want, find a seat and they bring it to you. It's nice that they explain how to eat the egg rolls and pho like a Vietnamese when your good arrives. The egg rolls were so tasty! I had the shrimp pho and my wife had the grilled shrimp and noodles. Very aromatic, filling, and wonderful."}
{"text":"My husband found this little gem. I love Vietnamese food and I have tried many different Vietnamese restaurants and this place is definitely not only affordable but really delicious. Think we found our new spot here in Surprise!"}
{"text":"We stopped by on New Year's Day, it was a chilly day and Pho sounded perfect. The service is fast and very friendly, everything looked well maintained and clean. We had the beef pho and started with egg rolls. Everything tasted fresh and had plenty of flavor. My husband added condiments to get his pho spicy, and I left mine more mild.

I would suggest this place to anyone and we will be back!"}
{"text":"One thing I can say that has held true in all my travels: the smaller places with limited menus and a very basic (but clean) interior will always have the better foods. This spot definitely holds true to that! What I like about their pho is that the both is solid. There is no need for fish sauce...just throw in some whatever you like to add heat and it's perfect. It is more savory than what you will find at the more pretty place a block or two down on Bell. Their broth is way more sweet and I needed to add fish sauce for some salt. Logically, it is easier to create a basic broth so that anyone can eat it regardless of their dietary restrictions. Head to head the two don't compare. There is even a taste difference with the meat that is added to the broth. V.Nam's meat has a cleaner taste, perhaps a fresh taste. I personally don't care for a gamey taste when it comes to domestic animals. 
I haven't tried the other dishes on the menu bc I specifically come here for the pho. The price is cheaper than other places AND the taste is better!"}
{"text":"Great Pho bowl choices with rich Vietnam special broths that blends amazingly with the fresh vegetables and noodles or rice combos and any meat..  The owner extended a wonderful welcome and shares with us the best combinations of flavors that would enhance the dishes we ordered.  We found the food to be delicious and worth a return trip.  Extended menu included all meat groups.  Eat in or takeout options.  I would definitely return for this good food  experience."}
{"text":"Limited menu but the flavor was good. The food came out like the pictures you see on the menu. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We are from Queen Creek to go to a ball game and we chose to eat here based on the location and reviews. Service was amazing, food is phenomenal!!! Highly recommend the pho and the beef and rice noodles. Wish we had taken photos but we scarfed it down too fast! The chef came out to make sure we were enjoying our meal. So yummy! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you're a time bind, this restaurant seems to achieve getting your pho our quickly and with great taste. There's a lot of flavor in their broth and they make it so easy to add Sriracha, hoisin sauce, and chili sauce to your heart's content!

I love how some other customers compare this restaurant to Saigon Kitchen. It's different. This place specializes entirely in pho so of course that's what the focus is. They keep their menu simple. Did you want chicken, beef, or shrimp? Those are your main choices with the pho here. (Saigon is upscale and trying to provide a different \"spin\" on Vietnamese food in general, not just pho. They offer salmon belly pho, and pho with tendon, tripe and Vietnamese meatballs which are more southern Vietnamese fare. Plus they offer other dishes like Pork Banh Mi or non traditional \"Shaken beef.\") 

Sometimes, I just want pho, and now that I know I can come here for a quick and easy lunch with great food, this will be one of my regular stops. I once said, \"Sure I wish there were some more unique pho offerings like tripe or those Viet meatballs but why add it if it's not as popular with their main audience?\" But I think they listened to my earlier review, because they now offer those more unique offerings in the Pho Beef Special.. I think it's one of the higher combos..like #15 or around there? 

One time I ordered the mini beef pho combo #3. You order at the counter and they cart you your food. I didn't realize my combo came with a shrimp spring roll and two egg rolls and some greens. They don't mess around with portions. For $10, you can get pretty full but not uncomfortably. It's \"just right.\" I might try the shrimp one next time! 

Another time I did order the Special Beef (with the tripe, tendons, and Beef) combo pho thinking it'd be lighter than the mini beef combo pho since it doesn't  come with the egg roll and spring rolls, but they just gave me an even bigger bowl!! Still just under $10 without a beverage! 

It's a pretty tight squeeze in this place unless you sit in a booth. It's not like we planned on spending hours where anyway so it really didn't matter. Come check this place out!"}
{"text":"Local little restaurant, amazing food and great prices! They remember what I order every time I come in. Try the bahn mi, you can get 2 good sized sandwiches for 8.00! You can't beat the pricing anywhere else in Surprise."}
{"text":"First visit, early October 2016: Wasn't impressed with the beef (was not thin and tasted cheap) and it was more noodle and less mung bean/basil/jalapeño. But it's certainly affordable and hits the spot when you're jonesing for pho -Saigon kitchen is not the spot, this is. (Although pt noodles is coming soon to surprise so hopefully they work on their beef before they have real competition out here. Was surprised there is no tea of any kind. I will definitely come back -and hopefully edit my review- and next time I'll try the shrimp.  Edited to add, we went back yesterday 10/18/16 a half hour before closing and I have now given them an extra star.  They made improvements in just two weeks since my visit.  They had tea - it's hot but I made mine iced and no kidding, 7:30 PM and a half hour before closing and it was some of the freshest tea I've had in a long time.  Very good.  My boyfriend got the beef pho and he agreed that it's not quite as good as Pholicious over in Peoria, but it hit the spot (and upon request, he got extra jalapenos.) The staff is super sweet if not a little awkward but that is okay, they clearly want to do a good job and impress the customers.  And then to top it off, a couple came in at 8 PM which is their closing time and they said \"we know you're closing we just want a menu\" and the cook said \"it's okay, come in and eat.\"  That's a sign of a small business that is going to make it. Give them a try... give them your dollars.  I believe this place is on the rise."}
{"text":"This place is exceptional for a great price! Never disappoints. My favorite pho spot! The service is also great and always fast"}
{"text":"I came in with a friend she got the beef pho and I got the chicken and it was so good"}
{"text":"Tried VNam Pho for take-out lunch today.  My husband and I split a Chicken Pho.  We both loved it.  For lunch, one order was plenty of soup and fixins for the two of us. 
The menu is very small and they didn't have a take-out menu.  Can't wait to try it again.  Maybe for dinner next time."}
{"text":"A great addition of Vietnamese restaurant in Surprise. This place offers variety of pho and other Vietnamese dishes. My absolute favorite at this place is Pork Chops with Steam Rice. There are also a slew of boba teas and shaved snow ice desserts. Good service and clean establishment."}
{"text":"No. Just no. I sent my dish back, and I LOVE Vietnamese food. The chicken dish was a fried chicken leg. I don't come to a Vietnamese restaurant to eat fried chicken. Menu is scarce which isn't necessarily a bad thing if the food is decent, but I didn't care for any of the three dishes I tried."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.  The shrimp spring rolls where quite large and tasty not sur though if the were made fresh.  Had the shrimp noodle which again not sure if shrimp where freshly grilled or just heated up.  The sauce is really very mild so ask for extra.  All in all would try once more but better Vietnamese food around the area"}
{"text":"We love that we have this awesome spot here in Surprise. The food is really good, I love the pho and their sauces are delicious. I love getting take out cuz they package it well and load you up with toppings and sauce.  I am most impressed with their prices, I have to admit Saigon Kitchen is my favorite, but I chose this place over them often because the food is almost just as amazing but costs a lot less. Plus I like different things at Saigon, the pho here is better. Of all the Vietnamese places close by this is tied for first."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly customer service, but did I say delicious food?  I keep coming back to this place.  In Surprise, if your looking for Pho, this is it.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Food was so good! Everything was fresh and put together well. The service was very good. Everyone was so nice that it was almost surprising. Prices are reasonable. Simple menu, which is good. I had the beef noodle Pho and it was really good. Came with plenty off veggies to add. We liked all the dipping sauces too. 
We have been back several times and I have taken the kids a few times and still awesome. The kids like the food. The owner has always come out and asked how the food was and chatted up the kids. A very nice guy."}
{"text":"We love coming here!!  The food is fresh, healthy, and delicious.  The owner treats his customers very well.  The prices are very reasonable.  Come in and check out the new expanded menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fast and affordable! First time trying this tonight with my fiancé and we loved it! For two large bowls of ph? and two hot teas, it was $20. If you're in the area, we highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love it! Their pho, their spring rolls, and now they have BOBA omg. Combos are good and cheap. I get the #4. If you get it to-go they put everything for the pho separate which is nice so you can put it all in as you like."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pho place in town. Never disappoints. Fast pickup times, great prices."}
{"text":"This is a nice new shop that opened up in Surprise.  It's next to a Starbucks too so that makes it a nice place to get in a quick lunch.  VNam Pho's best attribute is the introduction to the \"Combo\" for Vietnamese food.  Not only can you get a pretty big portion of Pho, they tack on both a spring roll and a cha gio, allowing you to taste 3 things in one meal without ordering extra.  Nice and cheap and solves one of the biggest complaints I have about Vietnamese restaurants.  Sometimes you just want a bit extra. 

As for the food, their Spring Rolls are amazing and one of the best I have tasted.  The shrimp are large, the peanut sauce is plentiful, lots of vegetables, and best of all?  3 rolls for only 5 dollars!  However, their pho isn't something to die for.  The broth isn't too flavorful, but if you're one of those that adds on insurmountable amounts of hoisin sauce, siracha, and all those other condiments, it doesn't really matter.  But if you like it lighter, then there isn't much flavor in it.  That said, I would definitely recommend VNam Pho without a doubt, and would definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Best pho in town, hands down. The ingredients are fresh, i watched them hand roll my spring roll. It is also very clean, the cook was wearing gloves and the kitchen was spot less. You can tell the owners care about their business."}
{"text":"Just finished eating here, had the beef pho...flavor of the broth was good; however, I did not like the tougher cuts of beef mixed with the more tender slices of beef.   Brother in law really liked the grilled beef noodle bowl, and my mother in law (from Vietnam) enjoyed her chicken pho.  Great option for Vietnamese food if you are in the Surprise area."}
{"text":"1st time here. Place is small but cozy and decor is very nice. Service was excellent. The owner kept checking on us. Limited menu. I had the shrimp Pho, broth was very tasty. I added siracha and chili sauce because I like mine spicy. The spring rolls were very good. Prices are really reasonable. Will definitely be back. Glad to have a place for good Pho close to home."}
{"text":"SImple, small place. Never been to a pho place where you order at the counter, but I knew what I wanted. Beef Pho came with both brisket and steak, broth was excellent and packed with flavor. Place is definitely a little strange with the ice-cream \ shaved ice bar taking up 20% of the restaurant, but the broth and meat quality were outstanding. Egg rolls were decent too."}
{"text":"This place has incredible chicken pho! It's authentic and delicious! The owner is super sweet! I had the best service there."}
{"text":"This has quickly become a favorite in our house. Service is always amazing, food is served quickly, always fresh vegetables and extras for our pho. I am obsessed with the shrimp and pork pho. I literally wake up thinking of it in the morning. I enjoy that they offer take out if I don't have time to dine in. Just as amazing at home. On one of our previous visits the owner came up for no reason at all and gave my son a shaved ice complimentary. We were so thankful and my sons eyes just lit up. He's always telling us it's the best place for grilled chicken and rice. The egg/spring roll appetizer is amazing. Before we found Vnam Pho I had never eaten it before. The owner came out to bring is our food and even showed us that we can wrap the egg rolls in the lettuce with sliced carrots and cucumber. Let me tell you it is amazing with the fish sauce! This is by far a perfect local business that knows how to make you feel like family. Huge portions, great prices, and a good heart. We will be forever customers!"}
{"text":"Excellent, you can 't get any better than this. 
The Portions and the food are very good.  You will also like the prices.
Love the frozen mango bobba , Pho is excellent I usually get the Combination Pho and  the 2 sandwich special to go I always order one pork and the other beef. 
This is our to go place, it's not fancy so you don't pay those high prices."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this restaurant and it did not disappoint! There are a few Asian food restaurants around but none specializing in pho. 
We were greeted right when we walked in, the place is well lit and clean. The menu is small and simple, which is perfect! I got the #3 small beef pho, two spring rolls and a pork roll. 
Our food was served promptly. They briefly went over how to eat the veggies and utilize the sauces that came along with them. Everything was really good and tasted fresh. 

Overall a great, little restaurant. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nasty food worker Was pinching our food in the kitchen and licking his fingers smells like bleach and side tables were all sticky very nasty place waste of money rather starve"}
{"text":"I'm not to familiar with PHO food, but I really liked this place. I went here for a friend's party and it wasn't bad. The service was quick and attentive, even with such a large group there.  The price was okay. I would say if your in the local area it's a place worth visiting once."}
{"text":"Ate here 2xs, we actually ordered the same exact meals both times.  Grilled pork and noodles also beef pho.  Fast service, good clean food both in presentation and flavor.  The egg/spring rolls are great. Not a huge fan of the shrimp rolls but never have been.  Great new option to try out if in the area.  Will come back."}
{"text":"I had the beef noodle soup (pho) ($7.95) and spring rolls ($5.95).  The noodle soup didn't have the full flavor that I'm used to, so I had to use extra sauces to make up for the big bold flavor that I like. But overall, it's not bad. The spring roll wrapper was a bit too tough and chewy. But again, not too bad.  
The prices were decent and the service was quick and friendly. 
I think it's worth it to go back to try something else on the menu. 

Food flavor: 3.5 
Service: 4"}
{"text":"The food was very good. I am a huge fan of pho and it's always nice to find a spot I wouldn't mind going to more than once. It is a pretty small place with not a lot of menu items but that's not what's important. The food is reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend eating here"}
{"text":"Excellent Pho, broth was exceptional. Served the chicken pho with a traditional lemon pepper dipping sauce.  Service was excellent, very attentive, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Terrific tasty Vietnamese food, at 2/3 the cost of Saigon Kitchen.

The owner was very busy when we arrived at 12:30, but he was very nice and we got our food quickly. There are only ~5-6 booths and a table in the middle to seat 8.

We'll go back."}
{"text":"The friendly owner takes pride in his Pho offerings.  The Pho and egg rolls (available in a combo) are very good.  I'm no Vietnamese-food specialist, but I thought the Pho broth was delicious.

Good prices.  Seating is limited; large booths and a center table section only.  Soft drinks available via a fountain machine."}
{"text":"Limited menu but good for a quick pho fix. We could have easily split the chicken soup. The girl who took our order was the sweetest girl ever! Super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Best Pho I have ever had!  Very generous serving of beef in it too.  Place is very clean."}
{"text":"Had the #7 rice noodle with egg roll and beef and did not disappoint.

Overall everything else looked good, staff is courteous, and helpful if you are not sure on what to order.

I recommend if you are in the mood for Pho."}
{"text":"Glad to have a phó in surprise. Egg rolls were delicious. Beef phó was good, the broth could be more flavorful but not bad. The service was good & employees were nice. It does get a bit stuffy in there. I'd def be back!"}
{"text":"I simply don't understand these favorable reviews.  Perhaps they are written by folks who've never eaten good Vietnamese food.  My wife is Vietnamese and is an excellent cook for all native dishes.  She hates going out to eat much because her kitchen is pristine and many restaurants are not.  And she can almost always make a better version of a Vietnamese dish in a restaurant.  Well, today I hauled her out, kicking and screaming, because it was too hot to cook.  We went in just before 3PM so the empty parking lot didn't scare us much, because of the off hour.  So, when we walk in, my wife is already navigating toward a booth, expecting to be served a glass of water and for someone to take our order.  I then pointed out to her the colorful ordering board, not unlike the two thousand Mexican fast food joints in and about.  So we ordered pho, and I was asked if we wanted to buy water or a smoothie, and declined.  Then I noticed that you even have to pick up your own napkins and utensils at the counter.  We did so, then sat down in a booth.  The table was sticky with the residue of the last diners...nothing that a hot soapy kitchen towel might have fixed...but wasn't.  My wife ordered me the steak pho and she ordered the beef combo bowl.  At the first spoonful you could tell the sodium content was overwhelming.  Blanketed on the sodium was just loads of MSG.  The broth was nearly clear.  (The way you make a good Pho broth is to simmer beef bones for 24 hours, let it cool, then skim off the tallow, then heat up again for a rich broth.)  Alas, despite the effort to add flavor with sugar, MSG, and loads of salt, the poor quality of the beef was obvious.  The brisket was very old and inedible.  The thin slices of the sirloin was okay, nothing to write home about.  I can't see this restaurant making it.  The  Vietnamese gentleman was friendly but his business model stinks.  The lack of table service, the lack of menus, the garish menu board behind the order counter, and the requirement to pick your own utensils is cheesy.  Not cheesy was the filthy tables and sticky condiment bottles...that's a health hazard.  Finally, I thought it rather amusing that, on the credit card receipt, they provide a line for you to enter a tip.  For what?  $20 dollars for two bowls of substandard (and unhealthy) Pho.  Nope."}
{"text":"Surprise has a new Pho in town.  How do they compare to other similar restaurants?  Read on to find out more.....

Location & Aesthetics -- located on off W Bell Road and the corner of W Brookside Lane near to Starbucks Coffee and Domino's Pizza.
Parking is shared with other businesses but the parking lot was large enough to find available parking.
Interior -- very small (-1) with seating along the left wall, a couple of tables and chairs in the middle, and along the right wall there was seating but seemed that it was reserved for folks waiting for their takeout.
As you enter the restaurant, the soda fountain is immediately there at the door, with a little kitchen area to the side for making the boba teas. 
On my visit, some tables had not been cleared and was so for a good 5-10 minutes or more (-1).  Apart from the uncleared tables, the restaurant was clean.  Seating were comfortable.
Noise level was average.  
Waiting area space was not large enough to accommodate folks waiting for their takeout without having them also looking upon nearby seated patrons eating.

Service -- could be improved as it was evident they were severely understaffed, and that's not discounting the Help Wanted sign posted on the front of the business (-1).
Wait times for the order was underwhelming despite multiple apologies from the staff.

Menu -- very easy to comprehend as it sat above the order area - clearly numbered by order number and plate with helpful photos of the items.

Food -- food tasted good in my opinion though I'm no world renowned food connoisseur of pho.  
Ingredients appeared fresh and flavorful.  Pho was hot though not scalding.
I ordered the port and shrimp pho and would've appreciated more slices of pork with a couple more shrimp but that's just me.  My dish certainly didn't look like the dish displayed on the menu on the wall or on their website....not even close.
Also ordered their strawberry boba, and though I'm no expert in boba teas, this one tasted as if Nesquik (strawberry flavor) was used to make it.

I probably wouldn't be back to this restaurant, and will return to my other local vietnamese cuisine restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome ! The portions are huge and the food is amazing . My husband & I had to share a bowl since they were so good. The spring rolls are great too. The person working was so helpful telling us how to eat each thing and what to do with the different toppings. I will be going back and back and back"}
{"text":"I love restaurants where you pay first and sit. No waiting for the check at the end....bliss.

Menu is much smaller than most Vietnamese places, it has everything I want though.

The pho combo is the perfect amount of everything for  $10! Small bowl of pho, spring rolls and an egg roll. 

I've already been here 3x and I love it!

Everyone who works here is super friendly and checks in on you while you eat to make sure everything taste great."}
{"text":"Excellence in service, food choices and overall experience - a must stop for our entire family. If you ask where should we go eat? VNam Pho is the winner."}
{"text":"Love this place. They are very nice and welcoming. Food is always delicious and served fast."}
{"text":"First time at this location.  Read the positive and negative reviews...decided to give it a shot.  Ordered take out chicken combo.  Food was great, employee was friendly and service was very fast!  Definitely will be back for another round."}
{"text":"Great place!! Pork vermicelli was delish !! :-) definitely recommend. Good prices. Great portions"}
{"text":"We came to Phoenix to visit friends and stopped by here for some lunch. I'm from Southern California and we usually have all the best pho places due to the large Vietnamese population, but I have to say I was very very pleasantly surprised by the food here. It was definitely up to par. VNam Pho is a small spot and their menu is limited but what they do serve, it's really delicious. I spoke to the owners and their philosophy is good food at a great price with no hassles. Their service was quick yet attentive. It's more of a fast paced environment yet it doesn't compromise on quality. the prices are good, the service is quick and friendly, but most importantly, the food is amazing! We had the spring rolls, beef pho, and egg rolls and couldn't be happier."}
{"text":"Their pho is immensely better than at Saigon Kitchen if you're comparing Vietnamese food to Vietnamese food!  The principal reason being is that the broth is not salty yet it's full of flavor!  

The spring rolls, however, are not as good as Saigon Kitchen. Here, they are over stuff with things that grow on the ground (grass and weeds). 

The ambiance  deserves only one star: this place is small, sparsely decorated, (actually not decorated much at all) with cheap furniture and poor ventilation.

If you can deal with those things, and are the type of foodie that goes to a restaurant specifically for the quality of their food, you'll love this place!  I don't mean to say that it is a dive, but it looks to be on the level of a yucky Golden Corral or one of those many Chinese buffets around town.  Don't be fooled; the food here is authentic and excellent. The prices, by the way, are reasonable.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Place is average tasting but the price is a bit expensive unless you got the pho special which is a really really small bowl of pho, 2 egg rolls, and 1 spring roll for $9.99. Well thats what I ordered.. the spring roll tasted old, the spring roll was aggressively average, and the pho is extremely heavy on ginger. So to sum it all up, I wouldn't come here again for no reason."}
{"text":"Great Pho for a good price. Ordered the special and the regular to-go on a Sunday afternoon and both tasted amazing. Can't go wrong with Pho :) Will be back and continue going here unless something changes. Thank you VNam Pho!"}
{"text":"Simple and delicious.  Fast and inexpensive.  I'll pay $9 for shrimp pho here that is ready in 6 minutes than $6 at a fast food establishment any day."}
{"text":"Feels authentic, delicious egg rolls, you wrap them in lettuce with fresh mint & cilantro. The grilled chicken with rice noodles was very good, so fresh. The place was packed. Nice service, good value. Would love to return and taste their pork chops and many other dishes."}
{"text":"Very good, very fresh Vietnamese food for a reasonable price. Friendly employees/owners, too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Has awesome pork chops and service is friendly a great place to eat. The food tastes super fresh a well made"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted so badly to like this place, as there are not many places that you can get pho in Surprise. However, the restaurant is small and not too many places to sit if you are looking to dine in. The spring rolls are wonderfully delicious and larger in size, but the pho is where it went all down hill for us. The broth in the steak pho is not good, and lacks that rich, salty beef taste. The cut of the meat is poor - many fatty pieces in both of our bowls. And last but not least, I found a hair in my soup. A dark, black hair... with the follicle still attached. Took everything in me not to gag. I really wanted to say something to them, not for a refund but to bring it up to their attention, but the restaurant had cleared out at that point and there was one other man that had just received his food; it was so quiet in there that I did not want to sound rude and potentially creep out the other customer (he definitely would have heard me), so we left. We paid for our food up front ($23 for the spring rolls and two large bowls - not bad at all) so it seemed like a major inconvenience and a refund was not that important. The workers are awfully kind and provided great service while we were ordering. Such a shame. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great pho, good prices. The gentleman at the counter who assisted us was very nice. Definitely a new favorite for my boyfriend and me."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new place because it is closer to our house... I ordered the vegetarian pho... was disappointed. It's nothing but noodles, onions, and bean sprouts. 3 slices of jalapeños thrown in but over all it gets 2 stars, lame. Broth was nothing more than ok. The spring rolls were good but not super great... lettuce was kind of brown from sitting around but they were nice and big. Overall I would choose PT Noodle in Goodyear over this place. This place was meh... and the pho is only served in one size."}
{"text":"Was under the weather the first time I came here. Searching for a good soup, I ordered their Chicken Pho. Was fresh and delicious. Exactly what I needed. Staff was friendly and price wasn't overly expensive. Went back another time and was equally as pleased. Will definitely be my go-to Pho place."}
{"text":"Don't let the fact it is a small place fool you. This is a great place. Had the most flavorful broth. Best I've had since leaving Seattle.  Can't wait to come back."}
