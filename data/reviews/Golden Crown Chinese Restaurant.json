{"text":"It's not that the food here is bad. It's not. The first time I got Hunan Beef, it was good; a friend picked up the order. The next time we ordered, I went to pick up the order. AHHHHH! I can't remember ever being in a food establishment that was as dirty as Golden Crown Chinese Restaurant. There's a newspaper clipping from something like 1991 by the order window. By looking at this place, I'd say that was the last time this place was cleaned. Everywhere you look, dirt, dust, grease, something unidentifiable between the window and screen. Front and back doors open, flies everywhere. Raw meat in a 5 gallon bucket on the floor in the kitchen. I wouldn't take my car to a mechanic's shop that was as dirty as this place. I hate to trash a small business, as I know how hard restaurant people work, but the owners really need to shut down for a week (or more), and give this place a THOROUGH CLEANING. Yuck."}
{"text":"I ordered here many times! I will never go back the last time I ordered wonton soup and shrimp chips... Because I'm pregnant and simply can't keep anything else down ... THERE WAS A MAGGOT IN MY SOUP!!! No joke a maggot pretty disgusting and this place is filthy dirty. If I want good soup or Chinese food I'll go to Jade tree on mentor ave instead!"}
{"text":"First time going here. This place has a comfortable atmosphere, friendly cashier, and the food is tasty. I ordered the Hunan beef combination plate and asked for it to be extra spicy. This time I actually received what I wanted and it was definitely extra spicy. I also ordered a spring roll which tasted very good. They have new items on their menu. I don't remember all of it but now they have fried or steamed pot stickers and I also remember the menu saying pho soup.   Overall it's a nice place. I will enjoy going there again one day."}
{"text":"Portions are ok, could be bigger on the pepper steak.  Food is very good, reasonably priced.  If they ever take more pride in their steak having a good texture, and wouldn't skimp on the portions, they would be the best.  The service is very fast, too.  Beats EVERY other Chinese place I've been to."}
{"text":"I ordered the sweet and sour chicken. It smelled wonderful. After one bite I was disappointed at the soggy chicken. It was so mushy, like it had been marinating in the sauce for a week. Threw it out and never looked back."}
{"text":"I didn't really like this place much to begin with, but my husband mentioned it and I wanted to get him what he wanted. We won't make that mistake again. We got General Tao's chicken dinners, and paid the higher dinner price. They were 85% rice, five pieces of chicken that tasted like it was made in the microwave, and some sticky sauce that obviously came out of a bottle. Disgusting and cheaply made. We will be returning to Jin House for quality food and better prices."}
{"text":"Food was great, the kung pao could have been spicier, but they customized my order and it was great and the service was great.  Would recommend"}
{"text":"Tasty and hot even when we do take out.   This time however while my husbands bourbon chicken dinner was delicious my pineapple chicken was mostly onions and water chestnuts...sort of disappointing.   The crab rangoons were crispy and crunchy tho so that's a good thing when they don't get soggy."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! You know you go there to much when they know you by your voice over the phone.  Not many people know this but they have homemade duck sauce and you can get it in your to go order for like 25cents-75 cents. It's yummy goodness :-). This is always my go to when I don't feel good and the Vietnamese Chicken noodle soup is...lets just say words don't begin to say how good it is!!!!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese food. It was ready to pick up within 20 minutes. General Tso's Chicken, Szechwan Chicken, and some Won Ton Soup. All were good. Certainly not fine dining, but better than the average Chinese takeout"}
{"text":"If you love Vietnamese chow, but don't want to drive all the way to Asia town, this is a pretty darn good spot. Family owned and operated and clean as can be, they serve a great variety of Vietnamese and Chinese dishes. Everything we ordered was made fresh and was extremely good! This place is an awesomely good surprise! The pot stickers were amazing, crisp and full of pork and veggies. We could hear them being fried in the kitchen. We also had the Vietnamese crispy crepe. It was the best crepe ever. Pork, shrimp, and veggies in a beautifully fried crepe. If you've never had one, run, don't walk to this place and get one. I promise you, it is one of the tastiest things you will ever eat!  We also had chicken pho, good, a mixed grill, better, and chicken pad thai, great! We will definitely be back, and tell all of our friends and family about this place. Who da thunk it, great asian fare in Perry! Hallelujah!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food! They are also very customer oriented. Their spicy dishes are like most places, on the mild side. If you like your spicy dishes spicy just ask and be ready for a flavor explosion! Its a bit out of my way to get to the Golden Crown, but worth it both in quality and price."}
{"text":"I love the golden crown.  The food is always hot and tasty.  Here's a food hack:  take the wire out of the carry out box and unfold it for an instant plate."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food with good prices. It is consistent in regards to good quality and taste. It is very clean inside and they have good combination prices. If you call in for take out it is available very quickly and always hot for your dinner to enjoy at home!"}
{"text":"Good food and quick/nice service. I've gotten food from this location many times and have never had a problem. Recommended and i will be back there again."}
{"text":"Although Golden Crown is small and tucked out of the way, it is an amazing place to get Chinese food.    The prices were very reasonable, the portions large, and the food tasty.  Usually, Asian food of any type is hard to find, but not here.  Almost everything they serve is tasty.  I'd recommend the Chicken Teriyaki or the Kung Pao Chicken.  The former reminds me of Hawaii, so it has got to be good.  I can't wait to go back with friends."}
{"text":"First time visiting and likely our only time.   We started out with the won ton soup, which I found extremely sweet.  The wontons were just dough, no filling as I usually see.  We then had the fried pork dumplings which were the best part of the meal.  They were served with a great sauce and were very large.  We then split an order of chicken Lo mein and General Tso's chicken.   Neither of us liked the lo mein.   The noodles were yellow and had no flavor.   There was very little chicken which was a disappointment.   The General Tso's had a decent flavor, but again not much chicken.   There was plenty of broccoli and carrots and the sauce was decent.  The atmosphere is typical Chinese restaurant, location is in a little strip mall.   We sat for awhile and finally asked at the counter if there was table service.   After that, service was quick.  Prices are decent, the food just needs to be better quality."}
{"text":"I give this place five stars it is the best Chinese food I've ever eaten it's always hot and it's not expensive they give large portions of food and they will make it the way you like it. I order the pepper steak which is excellent I also like to order the beef and broccoli the Pork Lo Mein and their house fried rice and their chicken fried rice and just regular plain fried rice it's really good."}
{"text":"Menu was impossible to find. Rang busy the first 5 times. Woman on the phone was rude and didn't give a total. Food decent for what kind of place it is."}
{"text":"I hate to write a bad review, but our dinners were below average at best. The bourbon chicken was very tough and had a bad flavor. We ordered lo mein, but it definitely didn't look or taste like lo mein. Took one bite and threw it away. Egg drop soup was average, wonton soup tasted old. Cheap food, but you get what you pay for. After living in San Diego for a year, you realize how bad Asian food is here in Ohio."}
{"text":"Our first visit but won't be our last.  Portion size is enough for 2 or 3 people or dinner for two days Very good food and very good value Husband was very happy with his General's chicken."}
{"text":"New to the area, my wife and I love Chinese food and we hope to find a restaurant that we can go to regularly. We noticed the high rating so we decided to give it a try. When I say that the place has no atmosphere, I am understating it. It has all of the charm of a mall food court. The restaurant is very small, with seating for perhaps 20 people. The menu is large and has all of the traditional entrees. Prices are reasonable. They seem to have a decent take-out business.   We ordered pan fried dumplings as an app, wonton soup, general tsos and chicken lo mein. We planned to take home any food left over. The lo mein was bland, at best, and there was barely any chicken. The tsos tasted decent, but the quantity resembled more of that of a lunch portion. The soup and dumplings were both very good.  We will continue our search for our go-to Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for a long time (probably 20 years at this point); they are very consistent.  They also have about 40 names for what is essentially the same dish, but it's tasty and clearly identifiable as the animal that you ordered, so that's cool.  Oh man, this one time I ordered Chinese food when I was in grad school (not from here, mind you) and it looked sketchy but I was hungry so I started eating it and I'm pretty sure it was a cat.  I didn't eat any more of it, it was scary.  Again, that was not from this place, just a cool story I thought you'd enjoy.  This place is good; I have to come back to try the Thai food."}
{"text":"I would be remiss if I said nothing was good, because the egg rolls were good and the white rice, because it's white rice and that was pretty good. But everything else was kind of sub par. Maybe it's what I ordered. The quality of the chicken on the general tso's was really bad. You hope for crispy chicken with a spicy sauce, but this is soggy and the breading is gross. The lo mien hardly has any vegetables, and is also pretty bleh. Stay far away from the crab rangoons.   I wanted to like this place, I had gone to the one in Vermilion and was even more disappointed. Seeing these reviews, and knowing it was under different management  I thought it would be better. The people in the restaurant love it, but it's gross."}
