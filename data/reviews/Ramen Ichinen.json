{"text":"To the ramen lovers out there this is a great hidden place to get some really rich flavoured ramen. I think it is one of the best ramen restaurants in calgary and I have been to most of them. To compare it to my other favorites what makes it stand apart is that there is never a wait time and the ramen is very rich and spicy with lots of options to customize it. Prices are fair and portions are not small. It is in a sort of hidden location which I think makes it much less popular than it should be. If you are on 32nd Ave I definitly recommend stoping here since it is the best one in the area for sure. You should try the red ramen and adding extra spice makes the ramen taste much better but I would not go over level 2 on their spiciness chart.  Great food and good service."}
{"text":"Right when we walked in we got greeted by a lovely young lady. She seated us and promptly asked if we would like something to drink. Not too long after she took our order.   Hiuse Made Gyoza Delicious but could have been a little more crispy, but maybe that is how they make them.   Original Tonkotsu Ramen Had it with the thin noodle. Came out al dente, which I prefer. Broth wasn't too salty. Overall, delicious. And the egg. Cooked or boiled the the point where the yolk was barely runny. I like my egg cooked this way. Yummy."}
{"text":"I live in Tokyo, and must say that I really enjoyed this place. Very authentic. Excellent service from the staff. Ramen delicious, and gyoza homemade-- can't go wrong. Definitely put this place on your list... will certainly be back next time in Calgary."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good service. Very kind and good energies from servers. Ramen itself was good. Chashu perfectly cooked. Scent, textures everything good. Broth was thick and really msg free. You cant taste msg here, but still flavorful. But it has hint of particular pork smell, but not too noticeable."}
{"text":"Small, hidden gem, basic ramen menu but we like it, not as crazy busy as some of the other places which is nice and maybe that is because of the location hidden away but the food is good and the service is good and prices are somewhat reasonable."}
{"text":"Ramen Ichinen is tucked in between hotel & some yard shop along with other unique restaurants. The restaurant is small and when we arrived at 7pm they were ready to close because they only have enough broth for a few more bowls. I ordered the Original Tonkatsu with fatty pork, green onion, thin noodle with free extra portion of noodle (love it!). The free extra portion of noodle is 1.5x more if you want a full portion of noodle it will be $2.00. The ramen here has no msg, this is noted in their restaurant (I know, because after I finish the bowl of ramen I don't need to chug litres of water!). The broth is very rich and heavy compared to many ramen restaurants in Calgary. The pork is thick and has a very unique flavour (a bit of a charred taste). The thin noodle was good and the 1.5 portion is quite a lot. The egg was perfectly cooked, the egg yoke was delicious.  If you like rich broth I recommend this place for Ramen! don't forget the FREE portion of ramen."}
{"text":"Wow! Having tasted the ramen in Calgary, I didn't know ramen here could actually taste good. This place though exceeded my expectations. I was expecting them to be good but it definitely was spectacular. I came for lunch and luckily for me was able to catch their lunch special. You get to add on a rice bowl for an extra $2/3 depending on which topping you want. It's well worth it and you'll leave more than stuffed. I opted for the bonito while my mom got the chicken karaage. Both were delicious and highly recommended. I tried their black garlic tonkotsu with thin noodles and fatty pork. The broth was rich and flavorful. The noodles are from Vancouver and were cooked al dente and not soggy. The pork was fatty, smoky and incredibly tender. This place took over the old space of where Clay Oven used to be, located beside Fat Kee noodle house. Do yourself a favor and try them. You won't be disappointed. Everything in the broth is house made and absolutely delicious. Two thumbs way up from this gal!"}
{"text":"The spicy ramen is one of the best ramens I've ever had. Amazing service too!  Only thing I wish was they had sprouts to put in your soup, missing that crunch!!!  Also their thick noodles are delicious"}
{"text":"It's a new space (3 months), and it's a quaint restaurant and very clean. I met Meg today, she along with her husband moved from Banff where they opened this Ramen Restaurant.  No Sushi here.  I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen special and for around $15.00 you get a bowl of ramen and your choice of Chicken Karaage on rice, pork on rice, edamame, or gomae.(spinach salad). I had mine with the chicken karaage. It's a small bowl with rice, with some chicken on top.  You get a choice of thin noodles, or the more traditional ramen noodles. You also have a choice to get green onions, and or green vegetables. All in all the Ramen was tasty and satisfying. I'll be back to try something else with the family  The location however is a little strange, tucked away in the back right side of a strip mall just south of 32nd ave. Not to far east of Barlow Trail."}
{"text":"Everything on menu is great, especially if you like it things spicy they have 4 levels to choose from. Love their mochi ice for dessert. Even their organic green tea is good."}
{"text":"After a week in the mountains of Banff, I was desperately craving some solid ramen. Though yelp reviews a few in Canada, I thought the pictures looked good enough to give Ramen Ichinen a shot. Plus, it was relatively close to the airport and near my hotel.  7pm on a Friday night.. there were like 4 people in the restaurant. Is this normal for Calgary?  It didn't disappoint! The tonkotsu broths were just fatty enough and not too salty. It comes in a fairly large bowl and you can get free refills of noodles. Did you hear that? FREE REFILLS OF NOODLES (thick/curly or thin/straight). Unfortunately, they don't make their noodles in house but that's okay. I liked the thick/curly more than the thin/straight.  However, at $15ish a pop, this isn't exactly cheap ramen. But I guess with the exchange rate, its price point is exactly on par with the states.   The waitress here is super nice!!"}
{"text":"Had the dipping ramen with the chicken karaage add on, and it was excellent - beyond on my expectations.  Very friendly staff and efficient service.  I have a new favorite ramen restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in the corner end of a strip mall (That has at least 6 different restaurants!) is this really kick-ass Ramen stop. My love and I stopped in last night, actually heading to the noodle house next door when I spotted Ichinen. We stopped in and were greeted warmly. Their menu is the epitome of simple; 5 main Ramen dishes, a few sides and that's it! I tried the black ramen and my love had the original. Damn tasty broth! I preferred mine over me gals's but both were quite delish. In addition, the best Gyoza we've ever had in Calgary. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that they close waaaaay too early (8pm) and they are located in such a crappy spot. But don't judge it on location (like this bitter old man just did ;) ) and enjoy some of the best Ramen you'll find in the city."}
{"text":"We were in this part of town and had intended to try another restaurant, but it was closed for holidays... so quickly decided upon some ramen prior to games night!  It has been a while since I've had ramen esp in Calgary so I was excited to try!  Atmosphere: 3.5/5  Overall simple, clean and bright environment.  It was not very busy when we first arrived but eventually filled up.  Generally comfortable; located in a mall with adequate parking  Food: 4/5  I had the original tonkotsu and shared edamame beans.  It definitely reminded me of traditional Japanese ramen restaurants where it was possible to choose green onions vs mixed veggies, fatty vs lean pork, thick vs thin noodles... and came with my favorite part - the EGG!  There was also a notice saying that the chashu, lard etc are all made in house.  Interestingly, there was a free 'upgrade' to 1.5x the amount of noodles.  As a result, my bowl was quite tasty and filling.  The tonkotsu soup is usually a little rich for me so I would have preferred other options such as shio or miso.  The edamame beans came as a huge portion!  Service: 3.5/5  Friendly and efficient  Price: 4/5  Large portions for price  Overall: 4/5  Overall I enjoyed my simple delicious and filling bowl of ramen here!  I tend to choose the simplest menu option but there are other tonkotsu and spicy ramens as well.  The menu is a little smaller than expected but I think it is better to have a few excellent rather than many mediocre dishes.  Good hidden gem =)"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! My gf suggested this place and it was delicious! Fast service. I had the black ramen with fatty pork, green onion and thick noodles. The broth was so good and rich. I really enjoyed both the ramen and the large green tea. Clean and modern space. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A new ramen spot close to my work. Stopped in to avoid the winter traffic, and was not disappointed. Got the red ramen (spicy), and they actually put the chilli paste on the side of the bowl, allowing you to vary the amount of spiciness you would like. I chose the thigh noodles, which I enjoyed.  Beautiful new space tucked in a bit of an odd spot, but wasn't hard to find."}
{"text":"Fantastic ramen. Great tasting broth. Quick, friendly service. I'll be back for lunch soon!"}
{"text":"Was expecting a more flavorful broth, but it wasnt that bad. For $13-16 of ramen you get to choose your meat (belly or shoulder), mix greens (green onions or leafy veggies), and noodles (thin or thick). And the best part, free additional noodles! Oh, and excellent customer service too."}
{"text":"I'm ramen fan, and I try so many ramen in calgary. But this is the place I highly recommend to my frds.Their soup is really made from pork bone(unlike powder or put lots of msg?and tasted very similar as what I have in Japan. Trust me, u gonna love it!!"}
{"text":"Finally made it up here for lunch. Service was friendly and attentive, despite being a packed house. We had the lunch special + $2 for the most savoury karrage bowl. The green onions were so fresh, I could taste mirin in the sauce. The chicken was crispy, the rice perfect. So good.   I ordered thick noodles with red tonkatsu. My husband and I both thought the red miso kicked the broth up a notch. The broth was  hot (unlike Jinya in Mission), the noodles were so nice with a bit of a chew. There was so much meat. The portion of noodles to meat is 3:1. I made a piggie of myself and added more noodles +2.   We will make a point of coming back for ramen and karrage. Note that they seem to always sell out of broth, so call before you come to avoid disappointment."}
{"text":"This place just opened not too long ago in the space previously occupied by Clay Oven.  It is right next to two long term tenants in the building (Fat Kee Noodle House, and Hu's Garage).  They have a 'soft open' menu right now and I am not sure if the menu will be expanded once that get the business on track.  Parking at the strip mall during lunch hour is scarce due to the number of restaurants there.  You may have to park at the far end of the parking lot if you can find a space and walk to the restaurant.  The restaurant decor is... how do I say it... there is none.  Walls are bare and all there is are tables and chairs at the moment.  I hope they put up some pictures or something just to make things a bit more interesting.  Service is friendly and quick.   For a soft open, the restaurant had 6 of its 9 tables occupied during lunch time is quite good.  My order was taken promptly and the ramen I ordered came out quickly.   I ordered the Original Tonkotsu Ramen.  At $14, I though it was maybe $1 or 2 too expensive when compared to other ramen place in the city.  Keep in mind that this is not a trendy part of town and the strip mall that this restaurant is located is not fancy at all so I thought the price was on the high side.  Other than that, the ramen tasted good as expected and thoroughly enjoyed the soup base.  Overall its a solid ramen choice in this part of town."}
{"text":"My review is more like a 3.5 rather than a 4, if half stars were allowed on Yelp!  Visited this place on a weekday at lunch and was surprised to see that the place was not even half full. The service was really good, with the servers asking us if it was our first time visiting and explaining the menu to us.  The restaurant is located in the NE, and in a strip mall with plenty of parking. I did have a bit of a problem seeing the place as it was tucked in the back a little, but no biggie.  I liked that they give you the option of choosing thin or thick noodles. I opted for the original tonkatsu ramen which was $13.50 and I liked that the dish came with an egg but I was able to add more toppings if I wanted. I thought $3 for tea was a little expensive, but now that I think of it, tea prices are usually not even listed on most menus and I don't even know what I've been paying for them at other places..?????  The lunch special seems like a really good deal, and you can even get a large portion of noodle for no extra charge (AMAZING?).  The reason I give this place not a 5/5 is that I didn't particular find the ramen amazing.. To be honest, I can barely remember if it was good or not which is not a good thing. It seems that ramen in Calgary is a concept that nobody can get right, and out of all the options that we do have, Inchinen is one of the better places to visit, if you are in the area. I did like that the restaurant was really clean, and how friendly the servers were. Check it out if you are as big of a fan of ramen as I am, as I definitely am still scoping out the best ramen place in Calgary!"}
{"text":"This place is a sweet little Spot with delicious food. The restaurant is a nice intimate local that's nice clean and cozy. Not many dishes on the menu but what they do have they do very well. The wait staff is polite, curtious, friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu. If your looking for a nice lunch spot in the area it's worth stopping by."}
{"text":"This is my fav ramen place in Calgary so far! Hands down, the best pork chashua- omg so good. I recommend getting the pork belly! But we also tried the pork shoulder and it was equally good and also very tender.   We order the original Tonkotsu- you have the option of thin or thick noodles. We tried the thick and I really liked it! Good texture and chewy. You also get to pick your choice of green onions or mixed veggies.   Tip- for for lunch, you'll get to add extra noodles at no cost! And the options of adding sides to your lunch for $2 or $3. Good value for lunch.   Would definitely return- my fav ramen joint so far :)"}
{"text":"Calgary seems to have a revolving wheel of new ramen places opening up. So unfair. I tried hitting up Ramen Ichinen a few months ago but they were closed the day we went (we went next door to Fat Kee Noodle House). Well, on my last trip, I made sure it was open and we arrived just before they opened on an early Saturday morning.  Hours could be better. They close at 8:00pm and aren't open on Sundays. The logo reminds me of something I can't quite put my finger on. Very Naruto-esque.  The inside is nice and quite spacious compared to your usual ramen joints. I like how the menu is small and focused with only 5 types of ramen to choose from.  - Cha shu bowl ($2.00) - this is the perfect appetizer. We got a mix of tender and really dry cha shu. I tried to soften up the dried ones once I got my ramen bowl but it was a lost cause. - Chicken karaage bowl ($2.00) - karaage was much better; well seasoned, tender and crispy.  - Original tonkotsu ramen ($14.00) - we both opted for the fatty cha shu, vegetables and thick noodles. It should be \"vegetables\" because it's literally a handful of arugula. I tried the broth and we both agreed that it wan't bad but it lacked in depth. - Tonkotsu red ramen ($15.00) - nice touch that they put the spicy chili paste on the side so you can drop as much or little as you want in your broth. On it's own, it lacked depth. I ended up adding all the paste to give it some oomph and flavour. Noodles were passable. I can't see the thin noodles working well with their broth.  Couple dollars pricier than some of the other ramen options. I'd say it's worth a try. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"We are regulars here. I love their lunch specials where you can choose a side for an extra $2.50 or extra noodles for free! My husband always orders their spiciest level 4 sauce for his ramen bowl. It is good! I love that they have huge mugs of their special Oolong tea. I can't ever finish it! The servers are always super friendly and attentive. They take pride in their establishment!"}
{"text":"The service is fantastic! You want great food delivered to you in a timely manner when the tables are full? Here. It's here. You get your choice of thick or thin noodles. Choice of fatty or lean pork. Choice of onions or mixed veggies in your bowl. You also get your option of how spicy you want your ramen broth to be, and I like to gauge the hotness of my ramen, you know what I mean. Give these guys a chance. Support them!"}
{"text":"The Ramen was sooo good!! I got the red ramen with extra spicy miso, greens, and pork belly. Delicious! We also ordered the Matcha ice cream which is to die for! If you leave without ordering the matcha you are doing yourself a disservice. Once everyone at the table took their first spoonful we all knew we needed a second order. Great place!"}
{"text":"Best ramen I have in Calgary, their broth is very rich and the fatty pork is perfectly seasoned. I love how the fatty pork is slightly torched which gives a hint of smoked flavor and it is very tender. Will come back very often for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and service is pretty slow.   Took over half an hour to get our ramen. Not good for taking a lunch break if you have an hour or less.  The ramen was pretty good but not as flavorful or rich as a few other ramen joints I've been to in Calgary.  The cha sui was the best part of the ramen. Portion size on the smaller side.   I'd recommend getting thick noodles.  My partner got thin and it didn't carry the soup and flavor as well."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the best spicy miso I've ever had. It's certainly my favourite ramen place in Calgary. The staff here are always nice and around when you need them. The spicy red ramen is what I always get. The broth is flavourful without being too salty. The noodles (I choose thick) are always cooked to perfection. They also give you free extra noodle if you choose."}
{"text":"I ordered the original. The soup was ok hot, quite thick and has a bit of pork bone favor. However, the noodles were not fully cooked. The inside of the noodle is still a bit dry and tasted like under-cooked cup noodles. Also the soup is very salty. They claimed that there is no MSG, but I was thirsty for the next 2 hours.....  For $15 there are other options out there.  Honestly the frozen ramen fron T&T taste better than this....."}
{"text":"Solid ramen. Broth is excellent, and everything they add is high quality. I will definitely be back with family and friends."}
