{"text":"So bummed this place closed. So few delivery options in this zip! Wish you all the best!"}
{"text":"Delivery service was fast and prompt. The food on the other hand. Rice pilaf is dry, no garlic yogurt sauce offered or hummus. And my caeser salad was dressed and left my salad soggy. But the sides of Greek salad had no dressing or black olives barely any feta cheese."}
{"text":"I have not tried medeterainian anywhere else but this stuff is the bomb. Order in advance because they do make it fresh."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this place by accident. As we entered we were warmly greeted with a smile. The owner took the time to explain the dishes and offered a daily special. He also gave us a sample of the Tzatziki sauce with some \"chips\" & a mussel. They both were delicious. My friend ordered a Gyro to go and said it was wonderful. I am not familiar with Greek food, but I will return to try some items off the menu. Great customer service and what we tried was tasty"}
{"text":"The falafel pita & veggie platter were delicious!!  Excellent customer service, I will definitely be back!"}
