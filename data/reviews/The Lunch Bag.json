{"text":"For years I rolled my eyes when people talked about \"amazing\" sandwich shops.  \"Seriously,\" I thought, \"How can something as simple as a sandwich be amazing?\"  It wasn't until I walked into The Lunch Bag and had my first bite of their (amazing) sandwiches that I really understood. Unfortunately, I no longer work near Scottsdale, nor do I live anywhere remotely close.  I've had to say my goodbyes, but I promise The Lunch Bag, my sweet, I will be back. (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)

+ Good ole taste of Mom's cooking... 'cept it's not from her.  I truly reconsidered how great my mother's sandwich making skills are after eating the Turkey Green Chili.  Sorry Mom.  Soups made from scratch, fresh meats and breads, AND COOKIES.

+ Excellent service.  The ladies who work in the kitchen are always happy and cheerful.

+ Pick up orders / delivery.  I personally always took a break from work to stop in, but you can call ahead and pick up, or have them deliver!

-/+ Small dining area.  This is mostly made to cater to the HUGE amount of local business there, so I'm not surprised they only have a handful of table and chairs.  Still a nice place to stop for lunch if you need a break. :)

+ You'd think with all this awesomeness there HAS to be a catch with the cost.  Nope.  It's all affordable delicious goodness.  Definitely competitive prices and I'd pick this place every time."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place to grab lunch!  They have many delicious choices to choose from and great customer service.  Their homemade cookies are AWESOME! I absolutely love their hot ham and cheddar sandwich and their caesar wrap! Highly recommend The Lunch Bag!"}
{"text":"For locals or visitors...This is the perfect place to grab THE BEST sandwich or salad in town to take out or eat in. Half sandwiches are available which is rare.  Great place for meeting a friend for a quick lunch. The owners are as friendly as their food is outstanding!  Everything is homemade and it's ALL great."}
{"text":"I sent an email at 11-1105 and at 1148 after not hearing back on the order I decided maybe they didn't get it so i should place my order over the phone...
I called and lady answered in an irritated voice \"can I help you?\" I by passed that and asked if I had reached 'The Lunch Bag' again in the voice, \"ya, can I help you?\" 
\"No thank you. Bye.\" If the customer service is degrading from the start why would I waste my time and money trying this place out?"}
{"text":"The brownies are delicious! But no one seems to know how to make a complete sandwich! I have to ask for extra cheese in order to get more than a half a tiny square and even then it is only half a tiny square of each. Remember, crust to crust is a must! Putting a small dollop of what ever spread (mayo, mustard etc..) just in the middle of the bread is either laziness or a lack of how to make a real sandwich, or both. Every bite should be good, not only two or three bites in the middle."}
{"text":"Our office orders from Lunch bag once or twice a week at least.  We love all the homemade soups, cookies, and amazing sandwiches.  Vegie Freak and Meatloaf are among our favorites!  Hot ham and cheese too.  MCS Biotech loves The Lunch Bag!"}
{"text":"Super cute inside - clean and bright.  Friendly staff  - Sandy, the owner is awesome, great prices.  Amazing selection of sandwiches, wraps and salads....and heres the best part - food is MADE FROM SCRATCH.  that's right - homemade meatloaf, cookies,brownies,  sauces, etc.  A hidden gem you surely need to try out.....not open weekends, fyi."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Scottsdale! The freshest, most amazing, homemade sandwiches and salads available at very reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"What a gem!  I have worked nearby for quite some time and just stopped by for the first time and I feel like I've missed out having not been sooner.  My lunch was amazing.  Certainly going back soon and often."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale, wish there was a sandwich shop like this by my house. Ordered tuna salad sandwich and soup. Sandwich was hearty and tasty. Baked potato soup was very good.  Price was reasonable. Owner and family very friendly."}
{"text":"The Lunch Bag is awesome and the people are great!  I promise you won't be disappointed, you will love their sandwiches!  They are the best of the best!

Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is a great sandwich shop. It's like you go and visit your grandma and she asks if you want a sandwich. That's the kind of sandwich they are giving you at the lunch bag. its family owned and operated and the food is so fresh and large! Love the people and the food here. Nothing better than grabbing a sandwich from the lunch bag and eating it at nearby mountainview park on a perfect Scottsdale afternoon."}
{"text":"Great meatloaf sandwiches!  Cookies baked fresh.  Nice, local owned place with good food."}
{"text":"The lovely ladies that work here obviously know what they're doing. Great service and quality even during the lunch hour. Prices are great. Can't wait to go back and try more items."}
{"text":"Great \"no-frills\" sandwich shop.  Tuna salad was fantastic and green chili turkey sandwich was delish.  Sandwich, chips, drink and cookie for two was about $23.  Cookies were average, chip selection not good.  Next time I will get sandwich only."}
{"text":"Hot Ham & Cheddar - Perfection. Sourdough bread was perfectly toasted, generous with the ham & cheddar, and the condiments were perfectly paired. Came with a side of chips! All for the bargain basement price of $8. 

Not to mention the owners are super friendly and order came out quick. If you work in the area, they deliver too! 

I will be back ... To try the ice cream sandwich!"}
{"text":"We recently visited Scottsdale for a little mini vacation. One thing I can honestly say about this place, if I lived in the area I would visit weekly. We came really close to closing time and there was a sweet lady working. She didn't seem irritated about being so close to closing and she acted almost happy to see us. We ordered our sandwiches, my husband got the tuna and I did a build your own with turkey. I enjoyed every last bite. We finished our meal and were very pleased with the service, quality of food and the restaurant was small but very clean. Couldn't recommend this place more. Thanks for the yummy eats."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this amazing lunch spot because it was close to my office. Family ran for a very long time. I literally feel like part of the family when I come in a couple times a week. Sandwiches are consistently amazing and the variety will keep you coming back to try everything on the menu for the sheer fact that it is all good! My three favorites are the Italian Stallion, meatloaf sandwich, and the Hot Ham and Cheddar. Free delivery as well!"}
{"text":"Everything I've eaten here (which is a lot) I have loved. Despite being so busy during the lunch hour the staff is still so nice, positive, quick, and produces quality food. Try the cookies or the brownies! They are delicious!"}
{"text":"Work upstairs from this place, truly a great place to grab a quick lunch. They are fast and the food is great!"}
{"text":"First impression: not so great. Two ladies working the counter. One was ranting about something to what appeared to be a regular customer. And I do mean ranting... F-bombs were dropped. I'm not above swearing, but I know better than to do it in front of a customer. She couldn't be arsed to stop long enough to take my order (I was the only other customer in there... it's not like there was a line), and didn't ask until my order was nearly complete if I was being taken care of. The lady that did take my order was less than friendly. She warmed up to me as she wrapped up my order, but by then the first impression had already been made.

I ordered half a roast beef sandwich with a garden salad. The sandwich itself was good - bless them for using real cheddar and fresh lettuce. It did taste home-made, which is what they promised, but it also means that I could just make the same thing at home if I really wanted to, so it's nothing really special either. I was just thinking that I might give the Lunch Bag another try next time I was in the area when I looked down and saw a dark spot on the bread. I'm not gonna say it was mold... but I've never seen that kind of coloring on a piece of sourdough. I tossed the rest of the sandwich - for better or for worse, I had already finished most of it. The salad, at least, was decently fresh (I wasn't totally sure about the tomatoes) and the poppyseed dressing was absolutely delicious... but I am almost entirely certain I won't be back. I don't often eat out for lunch, but the Lunch Bag is close to my nearest post office, so they *could* have had a regular customer... but they missed their shot.

Too bad, 'cause their cookies looked awesome."}
{"text":"I stopped by due to picking a lunch place at random. It was a small trek for me to get to, but was worth it. 
For $6, I got a hefty half-sandwich and cup of fruit. I find that to be a good deal! The turkey sandwich I got had plenty of meat on it, and the bread wasn't so thick as to be a meal unto itself. And the cup of fruit was a big cup (I'd guess a 12oz drink cup) filled with fruit. 
I recommend this place! Eating there is a bit cramped inside, and a couple tables were outside, but picking up to go works just fine as the food was tasty and plentiful."}
{"text":"Impressive. Simple. Well made. Loaded sandwich. This is so well done I forget how simple it is!  Great product, well made. It is even wrapped well. 
I ordered the Italian Stallion it is great. The meat is sliced  thinly, produce is fresh and the bread is fantastic!  

Definitely a place to go again. And again!  Cheers to Erica for doing this well!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly and helpful staff.  Recommend for take out, not a very good option for siting and eating.  Excellent quick bite pick up and leave option.  Usually once a week or every other."}
{"text":"The food here has never been disappointing, even when I got somebody elses order by mistake (Club). LOL  The Veggie Freak is amazing. I don't eat here all the time, nice break from the norm. You get small bag of chips and a sandwich, use to be $7 or 8 bucks and some change. but just noticed they raised their prices to $8.25? (it's probably been a good 6 month since we've ordered from here) Would order here more, but other ladies in the office feel its too pricey. (I still feel the quality is worth it)"}
{"text":"Best lunch place ! Food is fresh and delicious!! Always friendly and quick delivery. We will continue to get our lunch from this place for a long long time :)"}
{"text":"Family owned. Very friendly and easy going staff. 
I ordered the New Yorker sandwich and it was excellent! Will definitely be back, especially since it's very close to my house."}
{"text":"This is my first review so hopefully this will state how frustrated I am. I work for a large company that orders from this place a lot. I have personally ordered about 6 times. 4 out of 6 times, the order has been wrong. I won't get into exact details on what the errors were but this last one is what caused me write this review. After waiting 1 hr and 15 minutes after order was placed, I called to see how much longer, they stated order just left and nothing else. When order finally arrived, one sandwich was not what was ordered and one item was missing. I called back and asked for a refund on the missing item. They said no, offered to bring it (probably another 1 1/2 hrs later), I declined. I guess you can take a credit card over the phone and charge it but not refund without card...??? I guess on the wrong sandwich they ran out of bread and took it upon themselves to make what they wanted and send it. They did offer to make a sandwich for the next order but I stated I wouldn't be ordering again. She said that's fine...we get enough orders from other people there so it doesn't matter......great customer service!!!!! Bottom line.....takes forever to get delivery....order is wrong...horrible customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I guess I just didn't get it. I ordered a half sandwich with soup and the tortilla soup was so oily I couldn't eat more than two bites. There were peices of skin from the chicken in the soup which was really gross too. The sandwich was good, but not worth the price of $6.50. They also charge 50 cents per extra item which includes things like olives, pickles, and peperoncinis. Really?!? I can see extra for avocado or bacon, but not the basic veggies. What a rip off. The sandwiches at sprouts are just as tasty and you can get all the veggies you want. They also have a daily special for $2.99 or $3.99 for most other sandwiches. Try that instead!"}
{"text":"This is my first review of any restaurant and it's because I was so impressed with the food and the people that work there. I ordered delivery from The Lunch Bag and it made my day. This was my first time coming in and I have to tell you this place makes you feel like you're eating in Mom's kitchen. You feel right at home at the Lunch Bag and literally every sandwich is homemade and amazing! Sandy the owner is the nicest person and her daughter helps in the kitchen as well. Everyone needs to stop by and try it out!! Be like Nike and just do it. Thanks again for lunch Sandy!"}
{"text":"So happy I found this little gem it is perfect I had the best chicken salad sandwhich and cheesy potato soup I've ever had! The bread could have been toasted or slightly softer but otherwise it was perfection, I will definitely be back! And the lady who took my order was as sweet as pie and a delight to listen to as she greeted customers, she knew them all by name!"}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp, so I wanted to review- The food tastes great! The sandwich is seriously huge for $7, and the cookie is just the softest. I typically order from Jimmy Johns on my emergency sandwich days, but this was the same price with more options. Thanks for the quick delivery as well!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch.
I ordered the Turkey Green Chili sandwich and it came with my choice of chips for $6.99.
We got there just before the lunch rush around 11:40. They told us to find a seat and they would bring our order to us. We sat at one of the few tables outside.
Lots of people started coming and picking up to go orders. We saw their delivery car pack up big orders as well. This place is busy!
It took a bit longer than expected to get our food, but when we did it was served with a smile and looked wonderful!
This sandwich is a star, there was tons of meat with the perfect amount of spicy toppings and the bread was toasted just right.

I might call ahead next time to avoid the wait...
This has become my favorite quick lunch sandwich in the area...go try it!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my lunch here! From the sassy owner to the satisfying lunch, I was pleasantly surprised by this locally owned lunch spot. Right off the bat I felt like I had been a patron for ages, as the owner was very outgoing; she obviously knows how to build rapport with her clientele! Next up, the sandwich: ordered a turkey sandwich with bean sprouts--very good! And got a cookie too! Would return for lunch again any time."}
{"text":"Small, out of the way and almost invisible from the road. I love sandwiches so I pressed forward. Great decision!! I will opt for a tuna sandwich over just about anything so I have had a lot of them in my life. This was the best of them all. The toasted ciabatta bread was a perfect choice. I will be back again and again and again."}
{"text":"I spotted this place at Via Linda and 90th because I have been dinning quite a bit at Andreoli's across the street as of late. I figured I should give it a chance and spread some lunch love around the neighborhood.  The other day I was back in the area during lunch and thought I would finally give it a shot and I am glad I did.  It is nice to get a simple, well made sandwich with the ingredients that I want at a good price and fast.  The sandwiches are kind of like the good ones a mom would pack for their kids in elementary school. The type that other kids would offer up all sorts of interesting trades for just a half of. After checking out the menu I opted for the fresh made chicken salad with tomato, sprouts, swiss (cheese is an extra $.50),  1000 island dressing on rye bread with a bag of Poore Brothers chips for $7 flat out the door. The sandwich was made in 5 minutes and I was out the door.  I don't know how fast my sandwich would have been made had there been a line out the door as this place seems to be a 3 person operation or if I had caught it when they had just received an office order, but for my purposes it was quick and at the right price. All of their sandwiches are 6.50 and any of the extras cost you another $.50. Extra meat will run you a buck and double meat will run you $4.00.  They have daily specials and you can get a half sandwich with chips for $4.00.  They don't have a website that I could find although you can sign up for the email club to get daily specials. They are opened from 7:30 am to 2:30 pm Mon-Fri and 8am-2 pm on Saturdays.  I wish that more places that served breakfast in this town would open before 7am.  There is a definite 1 star deduction for no website/ ability to see the menu online. Half a point deduction for not being open early enough to actually get their breakfast before I have to be at work. If those problems are fixed, then this great little spot automatically becomes a 4 to 4.5 star joint."}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to Yelp. Great sandwiches. Had the chicken salad, tuna salad, double decker club, and a build your own with lots of meat and nothing else. All four of us were exceedingly happy with our sandwiches. Also try the desserts. The cookies and brownies were awesome."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place only a day ago! Amazing and fresh food!!! Delivers to businesses for free which us so helpful for peopke like me that cant always leave for lunch. They are so professional and food is so good :)"}
{"text":"I grew up in  small town in MN, so I love places like the Lunch Bag, where you only need to come in a couple of times before they recognize you as a \"regular\". The same two women, who are a mother and daughter team, are always working so the atmosphere is friendly and familiar. And the food is great! Nothing super fancy, but good, wholesome, tasty and definitely fresh. It's a small establishment, with limited seating, but the menu is robust and offers a great deal of options. Their baked desserts (cookies and brownies--if you can get them, they often sell out towards 2pm) are amazing! So glad this place is close by as I visit at least 2-3 times a month. Thumbs up in my book."}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop! I order online through yelp and my food arrives fast and it's delicious. This is my go to for a salad or a sandwich."}
{"text":"We order from work for special occasions or just to treat ourselves. Everyone enjoys and they always custom order however you would like. I recommend for great food and timely delivery. We have ordered from there for years."}
{"text":"Love this place! Went one time on a whim and I have to say it's absolutely delicious. Kind of one of those things when people say sandwiches taste better made by another person! Well, they were delightful and I absolutely LOVED the cookie!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Super cute little mom n pop place, with very friendly customer service. The food is to die for! And everything is a great price. Definitely my new spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Sandy and Erica are always so nice, entertaining, and fast  The food is delicious and fresh.  There are lots of choices and the prices are very reasonable.  There's also outside seating which is great. I encourage anyone looking for a great lunch to come here!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of my sandwich being tossed into the microwave twice. I think they heated up the turkey in the microwave and then they decided to melt the cheese in the micro as well. This was the turkey rueben and it was a pretty lame move on these guys part, especially when I see a flattop grill right below the microwave. Bread would have been crispier and the sandwich as a whole would have been great, but even these two local women decide to take shortcuts and the results are a soggy sandwich made by lazy cooks/owners. They still use quality turkey, but the rest is a joke."}
{"text":"Was ordering lunch but there phone wouldn't go through so tried emailing them to place order! Not only did they not get back to us for over an hour they emailed back saying \"it's tough dealing with stupid people like you\" worst customer service ever!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I've been there a few times and have loved everything I've ordered.  Went there today and decided that its time to finally review this place.  I had the meatloaf sandwich today and it was phenomenal! It was also very big. I tried to eat the entire sandwich for lunch and just couldn't do it.  I didn't want to stop eating it because it was just that good, but I eventually gave in and looks like I'll be having half of it for dinner. The sandwich is ginormous! 

I've also tried the chicken walnut salad and it is TDF! It is a large salad and there is a lot of chicken on it. I have no complaints about this or anything else that I've had from the Lunch Bag.

The icing on the cake is the customer service. Everyone there is wonderful and friendly.  I really enjoy visiting this establishment for lunch.  Great food and great service. I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"Total hidden gem. I work right around the corner and love coming here for a nice home cooked soup and (NO JOKE) the best sandwiches in town. Each time I come for lunch the food has been super fresh, the ladies have been extremely helpful and for the quality I think its priced pretty well. I typically get the veggie freak and add bacon with the soup of the day, I dont know how they figured to add poppy seed dressing on the sandwich but it sure works nicely with the avocado and sprouts, I'm addicted! (Btw photo does not do justice, it's so good!! )"}
{"text":"Wow! Tired of my usual lunch spots, I decided to give The Lunch Bag a try and ordered the Turkey Green Chili sandwich.  I'm not a big meat eater and saw a pic of how thick with turkey this sandwich comes which made me a bit nervous - but it turns out that it was so fresh, I loved every bite!  And a tomato that fresh makes a big difference too.  I will definitely be back for this sandwich, and have already told my co-workers they need to head over there too."}
{"text":"I happened upon this place by accident after a doctors appointment, and what a find!!!! Such a great little place, family owned and operated, some of the best sandwiches in town!! The service was fast and very friendly, and the mother/daughter team working there are sweet as can be, and sure know how to whip up some great quality food with a smile!  I highly recommend the southwest turkey sandwich, with a Ghiradelli brownie afterwards!"}
{"text":"Have ordered the Italian Stallion, delicious. Even 2 days later it's good. My coworkers have ordered chicken breast ciabatta, she loved. They enjoyed the wraps too. Love that they deliver."}
{"text":"I nominate The Lunch Bag as one of the most delicious, quickest and cheapest sandwiches in and around Mountain View/ Via Linda area. Everything that I've had here was delicious and fresh, bonus points for delivering in the local area! When I ate meat, my standard was their turkey, bacon and pepperoncini on toasted sourdough, but their veggie sandwich is very god as well. So easy to fax in the order and either pick your order up or have it delivered. I miss working in the area and having TLB as a tasty lunch!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed because i have been a loyal customer of this place for quite sometime and after today I will not order again. It has progressively gone down in quality, they have been extremely late several times and have made poor quality sandwiches for me on at least 2 other occasions. Today they used and end cut piece of bread on my sandwich and flipped it upside down hoping i wouldn't notice. This made all the sandwich ingredients fall out and impossible to eat. Really bummed that its gone downhill."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've been going here for two years and have always had a delicious sandwich or wrap. Their food always tastes so fresh and homemade.  I love that it comes in a little brown bag - it truly feels like you're getting a meal made from mom! Their sandwiches also come with chips, which is really nice, and their prices are great. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A colleague and I decided to order lunch today, along with some other coworkers. I was excited to try this place based on the Yelp reviews but was unable to do so due to awful customer service.

We placed an order via phone at 11:10, leaving just a name and location for delivery. My colleague's credit card was charged over the phone and we were given an expected delivery time of 12:15. The business did not ask for my colleague's phone number.

12:15 rolls around, no delivery. 12:20, no delivery. 12:25, 12:30, and finally we call them at 12:35. The person on the other end told us they were out of bacon, which was the key ingredient of several of our sandwich orders. Instead of reaching out to us to 1) offer is the opportunity to make a switch, 2) even tell us about the issue and 3) give us the opportunity to cancel the order, this place just did nothing -- they already charged the credit card! What an awful customer experience, I will never even remotely get the urge to try this place after this... what a sad excuse for customer service."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!!  Today I got the chili and a 1/2 veggie freak. Had it delivered and it was right on time. Key is to make sure you ask what their time frame is in case they already have a lot of orders in. So delicious! Monday is starting to look better than Grumpy cat!"}
{"text":"This place has good sandwiches, definitely has a home feel when it comes to the food, in a good way. Not really much space to each inside, but perfect for to go orders. Friendly service as well."}
{"text":"I ordered a toasted pastrami with Swiss on rye and a couple sides for delivery to my house. The delivery driver was very nice. I appreciated the way everything was packed....my sandwich wasn't smashed which was nice. 

I was a little disappointed in the sandwich because I ordered a toasted sandwich and it definitely was not toasted. BUT the sandwich was still delicious, my preference is just to have toasted bread. The oatmeal cookie was good, it has a distinct almond taste. Fruit cup was ok....the cantaloupe was a little overripe but cantaloupe is a fickle fruit so it wasn't a deal breaker. Overall, my sandwich was good. I'll definitely try this place in person next time."}
{"text":"Not a huge menu, but it's definitely filled with some great options! 

We had:
 - Chicken salad sandwich (quite good, would recommend).
 - New Yorker - also good, but perhaps better to eat that in than take out - the bread can get a little soaked if it sits.

We often visit Vermont Sandwich company across the street - also good. Relative to this, The Lunch Bag seems to have slightly smaller portions, but also less expensive than Vermont. The chicken salad is pretty comparable, but I might edge out TLB over Vermont for that one.... :)

Wished they had the almond cookie the other reviewer raved about, but guessing it was lighter options today since it's the day before Thanksgiving and I assume they'll be closed for the next 4 days.

Originally wanted the hot ham & cheese, but they were out of ham :( - again, guessing it was just due to the upcoming holiday/being closed. As a make-good, she did give me a free brownie!

Super friendly service nudges this to 5 stars."}
{"text":"I noticed that there were two listings for this business on Yelp. I can only assume that it's because this location was once owned by different people, but under the same name. Having never been to The Lunch Bag under EITHER owner prior to this, I can only speak for the new regime. 

If you're not looking for this place, you'll most likely miss it. Located at the corner of Via Linda and 90th, The Lunch Bag is a very small sandwich shop located on the bottom floor what looks like an old executive building. Let's say that it's \"quaint.\"  

As you approach the building, you're greeted by a cute little storefront http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xnewsBhNreOfi36cMFOM6Q?select=gPA2dZcP7pzbZgVHZUXyNQ#vPFdolsh7OOgfSmiuHCxHA, which gives it that local flavor. You'll also have to pass by the outdoor seating area. There are four tables total, all spread across the storefront, nicely tucked in under the natural awning created by the second story businesses http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xnewsBhNreOfi36cMFOM6Q?select=gPA2dZcP7pzbZgVHZUXyNQ#WwaqX-Ap83NRX5Ovd9Stdw. 

Once you get inside, you realize why the outdoor seating is so abundant. The seating inside is very limited. It IS there, though. So, if you happen to be here during a lull, you'll be able to sit down at one of the three or four decent indoor seats.

The menus here, just like at many local businesses, are made by hand using different colors of chalk (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xnewsBhNreOfi36cMFOM6Q?select=gPA2dZcP7pzbZgVHZUXyNQ#iZbj9PSgVOa76Pa07dCIgg). This, in my opinion, is another great touch to any local business. There are several different menus hung on the wall, each one shouting out a particular portion of the available menu. There are sections for salads, sandwiches, and even deserts! For such a small place, they certainly offer a lot of options. Although I didn't see it anywhere on the menu, they DO offer options for children (Turkey, Ham, and PB&J). They also have a limited selection of sodas, but only in cans @ $1.00 each.

With my daughter in tow, we stopped in for lunch. She ordered the PB&J. The owner was kind enough to quarter the sandwich for my daughter, which for some reason tickled her pink. I asked my daughter how her sandwich was. She said, \"It's the best sandwich I've ever eaten, daddy.\" Granted, she's 3 1/2, so her life experience is limited. But still...I'd say that's high praise.

As for me, I opted for a deli sandwich with turkey on 12 grain wheat. They stacked this sandwich to the moon and back! I could barely take a bite out of it without almost hurting myself. Although the size WAS a great selling point, it wasn't the MAIN thing. Even though it was a standard deli sandwich, something about it was really good. Perhaps it's because it came from loving hands. Sometimes that stuff matters most of all.

One more unique feature about this place is the fact that they deliver for free. You can call your order in, or you can even fax it, and they'll deliver it to you free of charge http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xnewsBhNreOfi36cMFOM6Q?select=gPA2dZcP7pzbZgVHZUXyNQ#HgyIiyt5IQ_9X7qq2f0OxA. 

I had a few moments to talk with the owner, and she says they're still trying to get out from under the shadow of some unsavory reviews from the old establishment. Hopefully this review will serve to restore some confidence in our fellow Yelpers."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! I wish I worked closer to them, I love all the sandwiches here. I truly cannot pick a favorite. But I've tried the turkey green chile, the egg salad, the chicken salad, tuna tulip & the meatloaf.... Oh the meatloaf!!!! Literally everything tastes of homemade perfection! The gals are always so friendly, they remember the orders literally every time someone calls. The phone is constantly ringing, because the food is ADDICTING. When I do have the chance to stop on by, I definitely make the stop.

Man, I want some meatloaf now.. *sigh*"}
{"text":"Yelp did us wrong with this one. The people seemed nice enough, but the food was just not good. The chicken in the chicken breast ciabatta sandwich was very low-quality (the kind of thing where you could tell looking at the weird texture that it was gonna be funky chicken). Had to spit out a couple unchewable bites and was grossed out/put off from eating much of it at all. It was drenched in honey mustard and overall just not a good sandwich. The spicy roast beef was better but still just oooookay (flimsy bread, not much horseradish, meat was okay) and not worth he price. Paid way too much for a highly disappointing meal."}
{"text":"Sooooooo good!  Omg just got the new Yorker for lunch and it was delicious.  Hot pastrami,  melted cheese, thousand island, and coleslaw on Rye bread.  So yummy!  The kind of sandwich where you want to lick the paper after devouring every bite.  Great little hidden place for lunch.  If the sandwich I just ate is any indication of what I can expect from the rest of the menu then I am one happy gal.  I love good sandwiches and you can't beat the prices either."}
{"text":"Sometimes it really doesn't matter what the food is like when the people are just this awesome. My coworker and I came here for a quick lunch the other day and were greeted as if we were old friends. The Lunch Bag is a family run place with mom, daughter and son working the counter and making the food. 

They were laughing and joking with customers that they clearly knew very well. We felt like we were really apart of something fun and special. 

The food was good too and a decent price for lunch. I had the New Yorker (minus the cheese) and it was super tasty. I would get the coleslaw on the side if you don't like soggy bread but otherwise would totally eat it again. 

Absolutely will return."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the people who work there are delightful.  It is truly a nice break from work to go get a lunch you know you're going to love served by people who are so friendly.  Our office visits there regularly!"}
{"text":"Super nice ladies who work here.  I enjoyed my turkey Reuben and will be back again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is the best place for fresh and delicious sandwiches. The people there are super nice and remember your name. Where do you find places that do that anymore?  In response to the gentleman who gave a poor review on them closing early. I was there the same time and they had to close because their water had to be shut off to make a repair. Health Dept. rules doesn't allow a restaurant to run with no water."}
{"text":"I love this little hole in the wall. Great find. I love that the owner is always here. The Italian Stallion, Turkey, Salami, ham , lettuce and tomato with their own version of mayo is delicious. The portion is huge.. I can usually only eat half the sandwich but it is even better later that day or the next day. Your sandwich comes with a choice of chips and is well worth the $9.00. Ciabatta bread is fresh and makes this sandwich. If you have not tried it, you will not be disappointed. Open till 2PM Monday through Friday."}
{"text":"I love this place, great food, great prices! The owner is super nice, and always makes sure our office order is correct. I really appreciate places that check big orders.
Good sandwiches, fresh and creative!"}
{"text":"Awesome! We order from here at least twice a week for lunch in the office. Tuna is the best I've ever had and the New Yorker is AMAZING! Quick delivery, great service and Sandy is a doll!"}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch! We eat here a fair amount because they deliver and we can never find time to leave the office to get lunch. I love their tuna ciabatta sandwich. They are always very friendly and efficient when taking and delivering orders. Serving 5 people was absolutely no problem. If you work in the area, they can send you a fax each week with their specials on it. Sometimes it even has little promo's like free soda if you order the special. The only downside is the price. After tipping the delivery guy it comes to around $10 for one small sandwich and plain Lay's potato chips! So, great to splurge on once in a while or when your boss buys you lunch but unable to afford every day."}
{"text":"Oatmeal Almond Cookie. 

The last one of the day. 

This is the cookie I want them to serve after my funeral (because if they serve it before or during, no one will pay attention to me). 

This is the cookie that I want my husband to learn how to make so he can buy his way out of the dog house every once in awhile. 

I've driven past this location a hundred times on my way to get Thai food...wondering, \"is it good?\" (we'll come to that in a second). 

I was content to not find out...until I was looking around the internet for my next lunch (this is how I pass the time anymore instead of daydreaming about winning the lottery). After reading a couple of reviews on Yelp, I decided to give it a try. Did I mention they had free delivery to my job as well (always a bonus). 

I had the hot ham & cheddar on toasted sourdough. The sandwich had a teensy smidge of lettuce water in the paper wrapper (I love it when I can tell that a place actually washes their veggies!!!), and although I ordered cheetos, I received plain chips (not a biggie, I like plain chips too, but I was really hankering for some cheetos).

But what made EVERYTHING right with my world again was that dang oatmeal almond cookie. Thick, soft, and oatty, it was pure perfection. 

Welcome to the fold, Lunch Bag, you are now a part of the lunch rotation. YAY!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find good food at a decent price in this part of town, but Lunch Bag pulls it off. The food is fresh, delicious, and well portioned. My only complaint is the small indoor seating area which measures about 8 x 12."}
{"text":"These sandwiches and cookies are amazing! Super large portions and very tasty. I'm actually surprised after reading the previous reviews, because I didn't find the people who worked there to be super friendly. I'm a very friendly person and smile at everyone, and they just seemed preoccupied. 
This isn't a HUGE drawback for me though since I can go to Subway (bleh) and get a sandwich with friendly smiles and greetings...but that's not what I want. I went for the food and it was worth it!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! My new favorite sandwich shop!! The chicken salad is homemade and has chunks of apple in it. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. They have great sandwiches, and great service. They even deliver to you without an additional charge at whatever cost you are spending. They are a family runned business. Definitely a HOT mom and pop shop for the real \"lunch bag\" feel. Great concept put into realization."}
{"text":"Think outside the box and go to the bag! This isn't your chain sandwich shop where  you're trusting a complete stranger to prepare your food. Here are you going to get a warm, personalized customer service filled with  Pleasant people. The lovely lady preparing my sandwich recognized me from my last visit- six months ago! Who does that? 
Aside from the great service, the portion size here is excellent. You're not getting an ice cream scoop size of meat on your sandwich this truly is \"just like moms\". 
The environment is nice the location is great and centralized, there's no traffic, it's quiet, you can eat outside. And above all you're supporting local. I highly recommend the lunch bag. For a sandwich shop, Im giving it five stars."}
{"text":"Found this little gem tucked into a corner of a strip mall at the SWcorner of Pima and Via Linda. Wow! Friendly service from family owned business. Nothing fancy here, just a few little tables and folding chairs inside and a few outside tables, but the food is really fresh and outstanding. I ordered the trio salad, which came with a scoop of egg salad, chicken salad, and tuna salad on a large bed of mixed greens with a side of homemade thousand Island dressing! The perfect salad for the gal who can't make her mind up. Boy did I make a good decision! Can't wait to come back. My new favorite casual lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Great food and fast delivery! I am a teacher at a local school and our staff orders from The Lunch Bag often. I have been ordering for years. The food is always fresh and they have an excellent menu."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches!! This is by far the best sandwich shop around town!! Great quality of meat and breads and the cookies are so so awesome! So happy to have found this gem. Not to mention the staff is just as awesome!!  Did I say this is an awesome place??? Great job Lunch Bag!!  Our office loves you!!!  Dr. Siegel and Girls :)"}
{"text":"This place is legit!  Outstanding food, service and great value!  Wish that this place was closer to my house......but, worth the drive for me. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Big ol' sandwiches just like mom makes 'em. I keep saying I need to try more of the menu, but I haven't been able to pry myself away from the Turkey Green Chili. Guess I'll just have to swing by more often."}
{"text":"Ordered a half sand/soup. Soup was ok, nothing to rave about it was something with broccoli and cheese. No real taste to it. The sandwich was the turkey-cran. Bread was nice and fresh, turkey was thin deli slices (and a lot of it) but the cran was just a dab and the cream cheese was also a dab, about a teaspoon and not spread across the bread. If I were to make this sandwich the cream cheese would have been soft enough to spread across the bread and the cran would also have been spread across the bread. I got the feeling that making this soup and salad was not real important to the cook! Husband had the New Yorker. Same story, different verse. Though grilled it didn't have much flavor. We also had to ask for our charge card receipt 3 Times! You know if you're going to depend on sandwiches and soup to make a good business you need to step back and do the basics! Doubt we will try this place again."}
{"text":"Placed my order today at 11am. Was told it would be 45 mins which is understandable since it's lunch time. However it is 12:17pm and I am still waiting. I called and they said it was still going to be another 15 minutes and then she hung up. Don't tell people 45 minutes and then take an hour and half. Rude.  Will not order again!"}
{"text":"Excellent Sandwiches!! I went there today for lunch, the owner was very pleasant and helpful. She recommended I try the Ham and Cheddar Sandwich. It was very good! The bread was fresh and the homemade honey mustard sauce was excellent.  I told the staff that it reminded me of the sandwiches grandma used to make only better! ;) I'll definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"We order from the Lunch Bag a couple times a week as our office is close by.  The sandwiches are ALL fantastic, the delivery time is short, and the value is there for sure!
Try the Ruben!!! great sandwich.... and the Tuna Salad is really good too.....also the homemade soups (I assume they are homemade) are fantastic!"}
{"text":"We visited Scottsdale for Spring Training and had found The Lunch Bag here on Yelp. Would highly recommend it to all. Very friendly & personable owners & the food was delicious. Will definitely go back when we visit the Phoenix area again. The green chili turkey sandwich was amazing & the brownies were a nice finish to the meal."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I regularly come here on my lunch breaks and not only are Sandy, Erica, and Bill the sweetest, but the food is amazing! The sandwiches taste just like their window says, \"just like mom's.\" My favorites are the turkey green chili, Italian stallion, and the hot ham and cheddar. I can no longer go to a Quiznos or subway because it simply doesn't compare. This is definitely the best sandwich place I've ever been to!"}
{"text":"I am a regular at Subway as their sandwiches are cheap, usually fast, and right around the corner.  Well, Subways stupid credit card machine wasn't working and I needed a place to go quickly.  I've been to Vermont Sandwiches before and I wasn't the hugest fan.  So I thought, the Lunch Bag....sweet!  I prayed it wouldn't take much time to get my sandwich and headed right over.  I have to be at work at 1:15 and it was 1 so I was cutting it close.  I got the veggie freak which was missing the sprouts because they were out, but she offered to put pickles on it so we're good.  Bonus points for having flamin hots!  The whole thing came out to 8 bucks, which honestly it twice the amount but holy guacamole it was so fresh!  I honestly wasn't expecting it to be that fresh.  But it was and it was glorious.  I would have given it 5 stars but the price...ohhhh the price!  WHY do you have to be so expensive?  You should be my new hot spot...but I cannot afford 8 bucks on a student/teacher salary.  

All in all, its wonderful and I am kicking myself for not grabbing a brownie.  If you're in need of a quick lunch, skip Wendys, Subway, and Burger King and eat healthy at The Lunch Bag.

I got to work at 1:15 BTW! ;)"}
{"text":"Huge sandwiches and prices are good. Fresh and they are fast with to-go orders. I've eaten here several times and even bought for a group of us and everyone enjoyed it. My Boss said meatloaf was fantastic. Gotta try it! My photo shows you they don't skimp!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my sandwich and cookie. Friendly customer service and the food was delicious. A+"}
{"text":"I've been ordering sandwiches from here since the 90's!  They deliver to businesses and homes in the area.  The food tastes like you made it yourself!  Great homemade soups and sandwiches!  I love the meatloaf sandwiches and I don't even like meatloaf that much.  It's a mother/daughter business which I think is even cooler.  I've never had a bad experience here!"}
{"text":"Good food, great selection for me & nice people. Fast delivery is a plus."}
{"text":"I went here in my lunch break and had a bad experience from the beginning. The lady who took my order has horrible customer service. I walk up and her greeting was \"what do you want?\" In a monotone voice and blank stare. Took forever to get my food and I could hear all types of side conversations while no one made my food. My sandwich tastes great but service was horrible"}
{"text":"Our office always orders from here but I refuse to anymore and here is why. They very very frequently get the order wrong.... if yuo request cheese, you rarely get it, sides? Forget it, they will forget to bring them. The food isnt too bad ( Although I am sick of the bone in my chicken salad) the service has gone wayyyy down hill. Its disappointing."}
{"text":"I just learned about this place a few days ago. I love their sandwiches. My fav is the Turkey Cran. They really pile the turkey on it. Everything is fresh. They have an outdoor patio area to enjoy your lunch. Never a long wait for your order. Great value. The only thing I would change is that they are open on the weekends."}
{"text":"So far I have tried the Turkey Cran and the Turkey Green Chile sandwiches. I am going to try the Pastrami Reuben today...and so far I am really happy with the quality and quantity of everything. The sandwiches taste amazing, and are so fresh. I would suggest ordering via phone because it is much more expedient that way which is to be expected. Every time I order for delivery they are here faster than expected. One of my favorite places ever for sandwiches! I hope I love their soups and salads just as much!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches at a fair price.  Great spot for a weekday lunch."}
{"text":"My CVS Health team ordered lunch to be delivered around 11:15am. Our lunch was not delivered until a little after 1:00pm! We were expecting to have a lunch meeting and called for an update around 1230pm, and we were told \"10 more minutes.\" The sandwiches were delicious, but that delivery time was unacceptable. Please respect the customers time and AT least provide an update about the delay. Will not be ordering from you in the future."}
{"text":"Nice small, family run lunch spot with outside seating and great sandwiches . Great change from the franchise mills"}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall, family owned and oriented. I walked in at about closing time and the place was packed to the gills! But mostly because it was friday and there was family visiting the family that owned the place. It didn't feel uncomfortable at all, they cleared a spot for me to sit inside and everyone was very nice. I ordered a double club sandwich. Sandwich was delicious, yes it's a sandwich.... But you'd be surprised how many places cannot make a decent sandwich these days. I will come back to this little gem, and i do believe they deliver, go and try this special place out and taste for yourself. I recommend."}
{"text":"My dentist just moved his practice to this area and I couldn't be happier! Not only is it closer for me but I found this place!! I tried the turkey cranberry sandwich on sourdough, the creamy chicken noodle soup and chips and the nice lady behind the counter said since it was my 1st time, I get a free cookie!! I chose the oatmeal almond and it was amazing. Seriously, one of the best cookies I've ever had. The sandwich was delicious and fresh. The soup was homemade and had hints of sage, I think. It was very tasty. All of this was 11.00 plus I threw in a couple bucks for a tip. I took a togo menu and am already planning on going back!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in today and picked up a tuna salad sandwich to go. The sandwich was decent, with a generous amount of filling, but the tuna was a bit bland. The drop in stars, however, was for the unpleasant conversation I had to endure while waiting for my order. A regular customer came in (employee/owner greeted her by name and asked about \"usual\" order), and the two of them proceeded to have lengthy discussion about the teacher walk-out currently in effect in AZ. Personally, I took offense to some of the disparaging things that were being said. Everyone certainly has a right to his/her own opinions, but it's not good business to make yours so known that you potentially alienate half of your customer base. As I said, the sandwich was decent, but I still ended up with a bad taste in my mouth at the thought of giving them my money again."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious healthy and efficient, easily accessible. Great menu and variety"}
