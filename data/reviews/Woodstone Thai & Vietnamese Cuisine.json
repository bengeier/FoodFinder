{"text":"The pho here isn't great. But there's a large selection of other food that is really good. The rice noodles is really good. Price is really good too. Every time we go its always busy there."}
{"text":"I frequent this unpretentious place regularly and love their food. Authentic and yummy. Fast service.   Green Curry is my fav. spicy, flavorful and presented with a rice mound and curry in a bowl. Very good.   Thai Spring rolls are lightly breaded and fried crispy. Not greasy at all. Very tasty and delightful.  Highly recomened. John N"}
{"text":"Either I've gained experience with good pho recently, or the quality of the pho here went down. Don't get me wrong, it's still good, but the lack of authenticity really brought it down for me. The restaurant is more HongKong-style as opposed to real vietnamese. The quality of the food is decent (beef is of good quality, chicken wings are huge and fried to order)  but it's still not at par with real vietnamese pho shops.  The portions are huge, price is average.  Though, in the markham area, I'm pretty sure this is one of the top shops. Pho On 7 further east on highway 7 is way worse than this. It's even more HK-fusion, and the noodles aren't even pho noodles!   The atmosphere is good, the waitresses are friendly and always willing to help. I came with one of my caucasian friends and upon bringing us chopsticks, hesitated but proceeded to nervously ask her if she needed a fork. My friend was slightly offended and as a result did not give tip, but I personally thought the gesture was nice as the waitresses intentions were good.   For real pho though I suggest you trek further south to Bamburgh Circle, where there's a Pho 88. Now that's good pho."}
{"text":"Located in a small plaza on Woodbine and Applecreek, this restaurant serves a variety of dishes ranging from Viet, Thai, HK-style cafe style. There are also choices for hot pot, rice stone bowls, HK style desserts, and milkshakes. It is usually a warning sign when a restaurant tries to cater to so many choices, that it lacks the authenticty of any particular area.   During happy hour (2:30-5:30pm), Woodstone offers a free drink with your meal.  But I just missed it and settled for the dinner menu. The dishes came in generous portions, so it's a good idea to share!  Ordered:  Baked fish filet in cream and cheese sauce with rice ($8.99) - Came with a combo, served with a Russian Borscht, dinner roll with butter, and HK milk tea/coffee. Most of the baked fish filet was tough to chew through, leaving many pieces unscathed. The cream & cheese sauce itself was tasty though.  Lemon grass chicken with rice ($7.99) - The chicken was grilled nicely and wasn't too fatty. An overall standard dish.  The waitress presented herself with an unenthusiastic look everytime she came by our table. But other than that, we were served quickly.  Overall, the food was sub-par and I probably will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place was pretty popular when it opened years ago but I find it very empty these days. Their menu selection is very extensive, from baked rice to pho to Thai dishes and desserts.  I recently discovered their Yellow beef curry (and beef brisket - combo comes with drink). It's my favorite yellow curry in the area! Not too spicy, very tasty and simple, and the beef has a good texture."}
{"text":"Went here & JUST caught a deal as they had afternoon specials from 2:30 - 5:30 pm ! My friend and I got a free drink. You can choose from coffee, tea, iced drinks from the happy hour menu. I picked the Iced Honey Green Tea which was quite good.  My pal ordered the bolognese spaghetti $7.99 (i usually eat this but wanted to try smth else) & I ordered the baked pork chop w/ fried rice $6.99.   It's a thai/viet cuisine but they also offer hk western style type dishes. I thought overall, the food wasn't t bad esp the value & portion. I almost wanted to packed it ended up finishing it... which I'm totally regretting atm.  Service was alright. We were greeted & served quite efficiently. Wouldn't mind coming back again."}
{"text":"The restaurant no longer exists. Not too surprising because my favourite hang out have its quality went down the drain in the past 6 months or so."}
{"text":"They served 99 cents breakfast! OK it is only a macaroni with ham, but it is cheaper and faster than you doing it yourself!  Breakfast - typical HK style breakfast - serving from 8 AM - a little more expensive than what you get from a food court but the ingredients they used are much better - starting from 99 cents with no tea/coffee, ham and 2 eggs any style you like with toast choice for drinks $3.49  Lunch - set lunch starting from $5.49 with choice of drink - vietnamese and thai menu: pad thai, vietnamese beef noodle soup and other rice dishes - portion is quite big, I cannot finished the pad thai - busy with the office crowd in the area  Dinner - dinner special with drinks - set dinner for 2/4/8 people - HK style Thai food, not too spicy, but you can make it more spicy by request  The service and the food are both ok!   They take Mastercard and Visa Card if the bill is over $20  Same owner as Kenny's Noodles, so you see some similarities with the menu!"}
