{"text":"The wings are great. They are huge. Blow native out of the water. 10 wings $8.99. Plus carrots and celery. Wow! And before 3:00 $2.00 off. And a 15 foot by 7 foot tv. Nice. Great service. Good beer selection, i recommend the nest. GO CARDS."}
{"text":"My family came here for the 2nd time, while our food was good, the beers cold our server, the managers wife, was very impersonal.  When we voiced our concerns the manager was very defensive vs. accommodating."}
{"text":"I really enjoy there wings and I love that's we got to watch Asu game and all the other college games at the same time. the bartender really knows how to make a good margarita. I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and each time the service has been extremely slow. First time it took 20 min to get a menu and drinks, thought it was just a bad day. This time there were 5 people standing behind the bar by the computers looking bored and one person doing most the work and not keeping up. Took 10 min to ask for an extra ranch and another 8 min. To get it- no joke. My few wings left were cold by the time I got the ranch. Besides that I like that they have a lot of tv's, lots of seating, patio, and decent wings. Servers have been friendly just painfully slow."}
{"text":"Like it had an interesting nite there. Food, off track betting, outside patio, friendly servers, but is hard to find. Reasonable prices"}
{"text":"My new favorite shirts bad in the west valley. Great specials, atmosphere, and location."}
{"text":"Had to ask for menu, Food was not so good. Tap beer was flat when I sent the beer back for a bottle I was still charged for the tap beer I didn't drink. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is literally only 2 miles from my house and I never knew it was there until they started having poker tournaments on weekends. Food is amazing, service is amazing and the place is gorgeous! My new home during football season is right here!"}
{"text":"We went there for the Packers/Cards game to test out a new place to watch games and have to say this place was ok for a homer bar. Food is just average to above maybe bar food but the beers where cold and inexpensive. Managers/owners were super nice, helpful and working the floor as the place was packed for the game. Definetly a good place to watch a sporting event at."}
{"text":"So we went here while we were on a vacation trip. A lot of my friends go here often to watch the games I guess. The atmosphere wasn't bad. The bartenders when we first got there were extremely nice and when we ordered a beer, they let us know the specials in case we wanted to change our mind.   Anyways, fast forward awhile. We were sitting on the patio and for awhile our waitress was on point. Was extremely nice, helpful, even would come out to talk with us here and there. This was when there was about 5 of us. As more people started to show up, she started coming out less and less.... We were on a certain side of the patio, and we had wanted to change the games, since noone was on the other end of the patio. Another waitress, not our own, was able to do this for us. Later that night, we had asked to switch it from one game, to another. Our waitress told me that she couldn't do that. When I explained that someone else switched it for us earlier and I said I would just go see if she could... she had the NERVE to say 'If you go inside you'll get everyone kicked out.' Uhm... why? What were we doing wrong? I felt as though she was just lazy and instead of going to change it, she'd rather say she couldn't. So I walked my way around her to go ask another bartender if she could change it, and she had NO problem doing so.  On top of those experiences with her... when we had ordered another round she asks 'If we were sure because our bills were pretty high.' Thanks for the heads up, but yes, we are adults and we would like another beer. To top this off, when we decided to cash out... she proceeds to tell us we need to tip her well... and would go on about 'On this type of bill, the usual tip would be $X amount' When I did the math for my bill, I did 15% and 20% and neither equaled out to this so called 'usual tip' that she claimed her tip should be. Worst customer service I've experienced in awhile. To try and tell your customers, they need to tip you well? How about, you're lucky if you got a tip from ANY of us for being so rude.   The food was dreadful. Everything except the mozzarella sticks that we ordered were cold and the pizza tasted like it came in a package... nothing more than a pizza from the Walmart freezer section.   The waitress KILLED it for me and others. A few people who go there often, wondered if they would return after that experience. Sickening to be honest. Not impressed."}
{"text":"We have been coming to the NEST for about a month now, service is exceptional, Cory is very energetic and on, never have a empty beverage, Food is fast and Great! I highly recommend this establishment!"}
{"text":"We frequent this place often. It's close to home and I have never had anything I didn't like. My favorite is the French dip samich! Not long waits for the food..they keep our glasses filled and tall. Small little hole in the wall joint but it is very cozy with a relaxed feel. Plenty of TV'S to watch whatever you want. Not a rowdy place just simple..all you need and nothing you don't."}
{"text":"Great spot to hit up before Cardinals/Coyotes games. The food is solid and the customer service has never missed. I have been in there 4 times now and tried a bunch of different things from the menu and have yet to be disappointed. It has quickly become a go to place when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I decided to hold off writing a review until I had several months attending The Nest.  While first impressions are important, it's equally important to evaluate consistency.  The Nest is owned by a congenial fellow by the name of John.  While John is often sitting at the bar frequenting his place of business, he seems to prefer keeping a low profile; John seldom engages with his customers.  The king and queen of The Nest are the manager Andy and his wife Leana.  Both tend bar and both are super servers. If you walk into The Nest and either Andy or Leana are tending bar, you can be assured the service will be super.  If both Andy and Leana are tending bar, the service will be awesome! I'm not suggesting that if Andy or Leana aren't your servers you'll receive sub standard service; it's just that Andy and Leana are so far out in front, that it may seem that way. The other star of this establishment and perhaps the most important if you're going to eat there, is Victor, the man in charge of the kitchen. Victor is proud of the quality of food served at The Nest, and he ensures that everyone working in the kitchen displays the same pride in what they serve.  The Nest consistently receives an \"A\" rating from the county inspectors.  Although The Nest bills itself as a sports bar, they have a comprehensive menu and serve some of the best food you are likely to find anywhere. They even serve from a great breakfast menu, from eleven AM to one PM on Saturday's and Sundays.  One breakfast menu item is, three eggs (cooked to order), three strips of bacon, home fried potatoes, and toast for six dollars!  The Nest has daily food specials and a happy hour. They also have varying free entertainment throughout the week. The Nest maintains a family friendly atmosphere, providing several games suitable for both children and adults.  Veterans always receive a fifteen percent discount off the entire bill's food items, not on that day's special.  You'll have to ask for your veteran's discount and be ready to show proof of being a veteran."}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times and both times have been better than expected.    Takes a bit longer, maybe they should hire more servers or maybe its just the time that I show up....hehe!     Food is always hot and tastes good.    It's located east of the Walmart near a new subdivision going in."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Bartenders are right on things. Secret little gem. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday night and the service was absolutely terrible. Sat for almost 30 minutes before being greeted and then went an hour with empty drinks. Finally walked up to the bar to get our tab and it took another 15 minutes for her to pick up the money and bring us our card back."}
{"text":"Warm beer, place was decent when barely opened. Getting worse with time, ASU games are not televised here."}
{"text":"I guess its location location location. This tucked away bar is just south of the stadium and a few minutes away from the heavy shopping and entertainment area. Very easy to get to with plenty of parking. Walked in to a huge open room with a good amount of actual bar seat room. Wasn't crowded but the wait staff was walking around busy so it looks like they were on top of everyone's order. A few microbrews mixed in with local favorites makes it a tolerable place to relax if all else fails. Tons of tv screens all over the place so anywhere you turn, you're going to be able to see multiple games. Ordered the namesake burger The Nest Burger and it wasn't too bad. The meat quality was very blah but the crispy golden fries made up for it. Overall price was where it was suppose to be and this place definitely fits the profile of a local pub. You're not going to get blown away but if you find yourself nearby and need a pit stop, this will do."}
{"text":"Kinda dinghy- service isn't that great- and the bar food is okay on some things (chicken poppers) and awful on others (pizzas). It's a fairly generic sports bar like atmosphere- but not eccentric or cool enough to overlook the fact that it feels kinda dirty and rundown. Some bars can pull off being a little worn down if the vibe is fun and friendly- this is really neither."}
{"text":"I eagerly awaited for this place to finish the remodel.... So DISAPPOINTED!!! Service was pathetic, my husband & I actually waited on ourselves since the brunette working never got off the bar stool. Bartender seemed more interested in us than our server, so we finished off our order outside on the patio. We never even ordered dinner because the fried mushrooms & \"teriyaki\" wings sucked so bad we decided to hit a drive thru. This review doesn't even deserve a picture.... Close the doors & send the bartender to West Gate where he can be appreciated!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here before a Coyotes game which was perfect; not a chain bar and grill and close to the stadium. We walked in and were immediately greeted by the cheering and yelling of those watching a playoff game. Even though it was super busy, we still saw the hostess/waitress right away and she showed us to our seats. As I looked around, it seemed a little older/crappier than more well known bar n grills, but it was perfect for what we wanted. I would come back for a drink and to watch a game, but not so much to eat.  The food was not the greatest, I got the buffalo chicken wrap which didn't have the spice I wanted or the flavor I was hoping for, but the fries were good! lol It's a nice, convenient place to grab a drink and grub before a game. Convenience is definitely the best part to this place."}
{"text":"Cold beer, friendly staff and great specials. I usually get their wings which are always good, but the burgers and sandwiches are terrific as well. Quickly becoming a favorite spot on the west side. Try the Spicy Cajun chicken sandwich and The Nest burger for sure. Bartender Amanda and GM Andy are especially welcoming and the service overall is quick and professional."}
{"text":"Awesome little bar! Bartenders are super Friendly and attentive! They have really good Sunday specials! $2.50 coronas you really can't beat that.  They have lots of tv's, two pool tables, and Some arcade games.. Food wasn't terrible, typically bar food, pretzels were big and tasty."}
{"text":"This is a really great little neighborhood spot! The bartender and manager Andy and his wife Leana are totally friendly and make everyone feel welcomed. They have the best burgers and on Saturdays  they have $1.50 kill a keg. (Mystery beer for only $1.50 until the keg is killed). I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great food! Service can be slow but everyone is super friendly. I love their Cobb salad and fried mushrooms. My husband loves any of their burgers."}
{"text":"Went to get some pub grub and beers after the Saints Cardinals game. The staff was pretty slow and inattentive, with the exception of the big bald white guy, who was great! He handled our orders and kept the girls on track, those girls were lagging big time. Good selection of beer and booze, tv's everywhere, but the food was sub par to put it kindly. The bbq chicken pizza was mushy and cold, and the Reuben was just flat and tasteless, as was the  dressing and sauerkraut. Maybe take some of those menu items off and stick to stuff that goes in the fryer or on the flat top from fresh ingredients? If the food issue is addressed, this place would get another star. They stand to do a ton of business with travelers, so step it up!"}
{"text":"Make sure you keep close count of your rounds of beer because our bill had \"a couple\" extra added. PLUS...they don't serve pitchers (boo). Anyway, food was average tasting, average priced, service was fine nothing real great to bring us back again especially since we were overcharged for the number of rounds of beers. Don't know until you try. (And then share on Yelp). If you want some beer and bar food for a decent price...don't go to The Nest. There is another awesome quiet little neighborhood place across the street, that is where we should have went tonight but now I know to never go to The Nest again"}
{"text":"Watch the bar staff carefully, it's not that they're shady but they touch their face and play with your hair and don't wash their hands, then they turn around touch your food, your plates, your glasses and drinks. Grosses me out. Clearly the health inspector hasn't seen this. I'll go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Today I am a fan  Have been visiting for 2 years. 5 negative and the last 2 were great! Breakfast is the best in town, priced well. The staff was great and very attentive."}
{"text":"Came here in the hopes of getting a reasonably quick meal before a game at the stadium, especially since there were many open tables available.  A gentleman opened the door & invited us in, but offered no direction on whether someone would seat us, or just find our own table.  We had to move from a rickety tall table to a stable one nearby. First impression was a loud open bar, with the gal behind the betting booth playing on her phone while we waited for someone to acknowledge us for over seven minutes.    A new server came to take our drink order, but brought no tableware, napkins or menus. She also didn't have any knowledge of the menu or drink options. The \"Red Something\" the server recommended tasted like pure coconut rum & overly sweet.  She also couldn't explain the Carolina wings, describing them as \"kinda tangy, I think?\"  When we got menus, we only got two for a table of four. From the time we ordered it took 25 minutes to get two burgers & two 10-piece wing orders, all barely lukewarm.  The food didn't take this long to cook, it just required the other servers realizing it wasn't for their tables & then leave them under the heat lamps.  Finally our server brought the order after it sat under the window for 10+ minutes. The burgers tasted good, fries were cooked well & the wings were tasty, though so dry of sauce I wondered if I'd mistakenly gotten the \"dry rub\" versions.   I got the impression this bar is for locals who spend a considerable time watching football & therefore can wait for their food.  Due to the rapidly approaching kick off time, we had to rush through our meals, stop the server for our bill & get out quickly.   As a former restaurant manager, I don't blame the new girl, I hold the manager responsible for allowing himself & the other servers to ignore helping her & ensuring the food arrives promptly.  Management also needs to train new staff, particularly on the menu.    I'm hopeful I can return & update the review at a later date.  As for this trip, I'm not impressed & wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Decided to hit this place up after some Cardinals training camp last weekend.  Glad we did!    The staff at this place are all super nice and make sure that you have what you need.  Though my friend and I didn't eat, they had a pretty decent selection of your typical bar foods and main entrees.    One big plus..$2.50 Coronas that were ice cold on a scorching day!    The bonus was the DJ showing up for a bit to play a musical Bingo game...he handed out cards with random tunes on them and you listened and played bingo!  I even won a game and have a $15 tab the next time I come in...woot woot!  The bar manager Cory was hilarious and gave great customer service.  Will definitely be coming back to The Nest!"}
{"text":"Great sports bar.  Very inexpensive. Pizza is freshly made and taste great! I went my kids and the liked it. And i have picky eaters! Beer is great the prizes even better. Kids meal are a pretty big sizes. We also had the nachos which are huge very tasty. Totally recommend."}
{"text":"Been back with friends. Definitely improved.  Still not great service. Total dive. Which is a bonus"}
{"text":"Management is good but servers are horrible, flirting with other staff members not paying attention to food orders. Servers were eating on the job. Location and layout were awesome though I would just like to see a harder working staff."}
{"text":"Get more servers!! The service is ridiculous!! It should not take 20+ minutes to get a drink or your waitress to come back to you. Cool that you have customers but what good is it if you can't serve them."}
{"text":"Bar review only. No food this trip for me. Came here on a whim after training camp. Cardinal fans hangout, I see. That's good.   I only had beer and it was cheap and cold. $2.50 Corona which is much cheaper than up the road at Westgate bars.   Sat for a while and played a few rounds of Name that Tune bingo, which was fun!!  Cory was super nice and attentive as were the other ladies at the bar. We didn't eat. If you're looking for a quick place to have a beer or 2, this place will do :)"}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices. Super ice cold drafts and bottle's!   Gonna make it a regular stop."}
{"text":"this is our favorite place for cold draft and nachos ,  love the place vet relaxed place .  but it could be more comfortable   not good for extended stays or groups"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday to watch football. The place wasn't too busy. The waitress was attentive and polite. Happy Hour specials are great. Great place to watch a game."}
{"text":"Wings were great, fries are tasty & the drinks are good too! They have poker tournaments here."}
{"text":"Hang on to your wallet and phone in this bar. Watch your 6. Stopped  by for a quick one on the way to Westgate. Noted a green, gooey substance on the floor, so we moved a few stools down.      Bartender was friendly and provided prompt service, so we upped  the rating to 3 stars based on her good work.  Basically a garden  variety sports bar.  Overall atmosphere was less than congenial.     Not sure if we want to visit again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken strips with fries and husband ordered jalapeño burger.  We were crunched for time and order came out quickly.  The food was fresh and delicious. We were asked how our food was by two different people which was a pleasant suprise. Will definitely be back, looks like a fun place to hang out."}
{"text":"Everything was really good!    We started with pretzel app...you get 2, they were brought to us piping hot and very tasty.  They were served with a cheese dipping sauce.  Be aware, they are made to order, so it took a while to get.  But, it was definitely worth the wait.  For our meal...hubby got a cheeseburger, which he loved!  He got fries with his burger, and they were good, but a bit overseasoned (too salty).  He mentioned that next time he'd ask for light or no seasoning.  I asked for a bit of a special order.  They have a reuben on the menu, but I just wanted a corned beef sandwich.  There was no issue with changing it up a bit.  Got my corned beef w/swiss and spicy mustard on marble rye, with a side of cole slaw.  It was delicious!  The cole slaw was exceptionally good...it was creamy, vinegary and sweet...yum!  The restaurant is pretty big, and seems to mainly be a sports bar.  There are a lot of TV's on the walls, and they were all tuned to either basketball or baseball.  The bar seemed to be the most busy, but there were a few tables being waited on, as well.  The servers all seem to be friendly, and while our waitress was helping other tables, the bartender brought us our food.  This was actually our second time here, the first was right after they opened just before the Super Bowl.  It was good that time, but completely empty.  I'm glad to see they were busy and seemed to have repeat customers at the bar."}
{"text":"LOUD is all I can say. Now I do understand this is a \"sports\" bar but to have music(loud) AND baseball game noise going on at the same time is just beyond silly. Our waitress Desiree was not very attentive, except with the \"larger table\" seated behind us. Waited 10 min to be acknowledged, took our drink order, came back another 10 min later with our drinks (she decided the larger table needed beer refills first) waited for ever for her to come back take food order to be informed what we were ordering they dont have anymore (then take if off the menu). Food is ok, typical bar food, 1/2 apps are a good deal during happy hour and drink specials are pretty good also."}
{"text":"still have the greatest moring foods,  don't forget the Kill a keg Saturday."}
{"text":"Found the place on Yelp while looking for a place close by that I could grab a bite to eat and watch a D-Back game. A stand alone building in a Shopping Mall that was a pleasant surprise upon entering. Hometown bar feel that was clean, a couple pool tables, tons of TV's, off track sports betting and a huge bar. I was surprised it not being very busy being a Saturday evening but it made it easy to pick a seat at the bar in front of the game. 3 bartenders, bar back and 2 servers seen but none seemed to want to acknowledge me. The bartender who seemed to have my section was pretty intensely involve with a texting session and the other passed without ever looking my way. There were approx 4 people in my section when one guy near yelled Leanne and got the texting ladies attention. She slowly walked his way without missing a text. She gave him a beer and did ask what I would like to drink. I ordered a Corona and a menu if they are still serving. I looked at the menu and was surprised at the variety. It took 15 minutes to get the Texting Goddess' attention to place an order for the Crafty Veteran Burger with french fries. About 10 minutes later I noticed 4 baskets of food show up in the kitchen window, one was definitely a burger and I waited in anticipation. after 10 minutes of waiting I finally caught the Texting Princess's eye and pointed to the food in the pass. She ambled over and looked at the food and went back to her phone then yelled across the room, \"It's not yours, Yours is not ready yet.\" Another 10 minutes passed when I noticed a male bartender look at the 4 baskets of food and begin to carry them out to customers. To my surprise the burger that sat in the pass for close to 20 minutes was mine. The bartender asked me if I wanted a fresh burger after I explained the Texting Goddess actions but the game was almost over and I was hungry. The burger was good, nice Brioche Bun, fresh veges, good thick beef. The fries would have been crispier fresh but were ok anyway. The condiments come in a basket but the mustard spout was so caked with dried crust nothing would come out, maybe a good thing for health reasons. Overall I would have given a 4 star review except for the horrible service from Leanna and the lack of interest of all the servers and bartenders except the one who brought my order. He was a shorter hispanic guy with shaved head, sorry I did not get his name, but he added a star to my review. The food and having sports might make me try again but my guess is Management is absent here as most of the servers and bartenders just did not smile nor care about customer service."}
{"text":"Listen, I'm no celebrity, but 10-15 mins with no greet at 1045pm when it's not busy is disrespectful. I just walked out. I've dined in here about once every two weeks for months. Normally service is a little more attentive (not that great in the first place). Was a fun place with good food, and across the street from my house, making it very convenient. I won't be coming back. I'll spend my hard earned money on a company that works as hard to earn theirs."}
{"text":"Hated the food! It was Christmas day and it was either this place or Denny's. Never thought I'd say this but should have went to Denny's. They only had appetizers available which consisted of crappy fried food. That should have been my cue to leave but figured we're already here. The ambiance is strange for a restaurant, it's more of a bar. The beans in the chilli cheese fries tasted kinda like beer was in them, had a slightly sour aftertaste. The wings were dry, hardly any sauce. The meat didn't taste fresh, tasted as though they had used the oil from last week to cook them in. Will never set foot in this place again, not even for a drink!"}
{"text":"Great food. Horrible service. She came to our table twice to pretty much give us our food and when we first sat down. Worse waitress we have ever had, cared more about being outside and smoking. Took care of pretty much one group of people and it sucks because the food here is really good. If you come here you pretty much have to sit at the bar to get service or hunt the waitress down for them to come and check up on you."}
{"text":"Great job to Andy and his crew spot on. Food was good and service was top notch. Happy hour was a blast for me and the family. Added pool tables and the place was hopping. Great job everyone"}
{"text":"After running errands on a Friday afternoon decided to stop by to check the place out.Been here before when it was Bajas. The overall atmosphere was cool except that the air temperature was warm. That was taken care of by the cold draft beer. The wait staff seems to be a little inexperienced. But the tall skinny guy with the beard wasn't to hospitable. He seemed to be more attentive to the ladies then the gentleman. Some times you just have to look past that when your spending time with good friends. I didn't try out any of the food even though I wasn't offered a menu. Also had to wait awhile for that server to tap us another beer all the while waving him down. Sort of a jerk. I will be back because it's close to where friends hang out. But I'll make sure not to sit where the jerk is serving. Give it a try . Oh and they have off track betting."}
{"text":"Great service, good food, makes costumes feel really welcome, and just a great atmosphere"}
{"text":"This was terrible. .the waitress was rude and argumentive...tried to charge for more than we had...then stood there and argued...terrible service. ...she got away with  overcharging for 1 more drink ...never said I'm  sorry ...or thank yu...she needs to get out of the cust. Service business...I will go back when they finally get rid of her....!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out before the saints vs cardinals game. I was very impressed by my food I had the chicken tenders with fries, my boyfriend got the bacon burger. I loved the food but my be got food poisoning maybe it was due to them being so busy."}
{"text":"Great food and the service you receive from most of the bartenders is great, there is one bartender that I can not recommend.  The wings are tasty and the beer is cold.  And quite a wide variety for the whiskey / bourbon, and the price is nice.  Love going there before the Cardinals games or after work for happy hour. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Had fun watched the super bowl had a few drinks and played a few games of pool. I didn't get anything to eat but I heard the have some good finger food to eat and get messy. I enjoyed my time there and their bar tenders were nice."}
{"text":"We went through 3 servers all in one visit.  First a girl with a short hair red bob, who notified us the bar didn't carry Malibu rum; like really, what bar doesn't have Malibu? Then a girl with long hair who 'got so busy' she never made it to our table to get our food order, next a girl named Cassidy who seems nice but she only came over because a guy behind the bar told her too, when we walked up to the bar asking for service. [he looked like the manager]  but she was standing in front of the kitchen window for a good 15 mins not doing anything but tapping her pen on the bar counter.     Over all, Food is decent, & prices aren't too bad. But the chalk boards by the front door are false advertisement. One board stated 'Half off appetizers' we order 3 just, & got our check, just to be told it wasn't 'now'. They should state the times more specifically or erase it, if it isn't the time.  Considering it's a 'sports bar' you would think all the tv's would be on sports channels, nope not here....."}
{"text":"Friendly crowd, very good food, off track betting. Prices are reasonable, and service is attentive. So why is the server/ bartender so pissed off."}
