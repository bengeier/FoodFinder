{"text":"Was okay. Meatballs good but nothing exciting. Had beef meatballs with provolone panini. It was good but 1/2 the size of expect for the price."}
{"text":"Great meatballs! The spicy pork balls are to die for! I highly recommend getting your balls over their risotto. We eat here every time we are in town. Never thought a restaurant could specialize in meatballs alone, but they pulled it off!

Be sure to ask about their special meatball of the month!"}
{"text":"Fun concept, lackluster execution.

If you call yourself a \"meatball joint\", your meatballs need to be really good.  We sampled 4 combinations of meat and sauce that were just ok.  $3.50 a piece for meatball sliders.  I enjoyed the mac n cheese and French fry sides more than the main course.  Restaurant felt new and clean.  They sat people in an enclosed outdoor area with temps below freezing and no noticeable heat.  Memo to management (in my best Gordon Ramsey voice)....if your guests are wearing coats while eating, it's too cold!!  Server was very nice but service was slow.  I prefer service that is attentive and bland over charismatic and slow every time.   We didn't get what we ordered and had to wait too long for someone to check on us.  If you are looking for overpriced food in trendy suburban settings with below average service, I prefer Burgatory in Robinson Pa."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 beers and a glass of wine and a Moscow mule,?Overpriced!  Bartender was such a mean person. I will not go back!  Terrible experience!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I'd drive the 4 hours back to Pittsburgh for these meatballs. Very authentic Italian, the marinara wasn't sweet at all! Fantastic beer selection as well. 
I'm still dreaming about the Tomato Risotto..."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Thursday and asked for a large table. Great service. For my first time going there the waitress was very nice and informative when it came to all of my questions. Great atmosphere. Delicious food. I do plan on going back."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch shortly after it opened.   Wife had the meatball slider - 1 meatball - and i had the hoagie - 3 meatballs.   We both enjoyed the meatballs and our sauces.  
Definitely not the place to go if you don't like meatballs - you won't find much else on the menu.   Bar area is nice and they have improved the outdoor section from the prior owners.   We'll go back - but probably not that frequently since it's just meatballs"}
{"text":"Enjoy the food, although yes it's expensive for just meatballs and sauce. However, one major issue we've had with both of our visits was the sun and heat on the patio. It was so bright they gave us sunglasses. While this is cute at first, it's a horrible way to have to eat your meal, sitting on a hot, bright patio wearing someone else's sunglasses. The heat was incredible as well and it wasn't even a hot day. We have three children, one of whom is an infant, and this just isn't acceptable. Other families would be in the same uncomfortable boat. Please consider tinting the garage doors and closing them in the heat of the day. An awning might be helpful, too."}
{"text":"This place is really neat. Loved the different ways you could get a ball and try different sauces. It's a really cool idea. Friendly service, good food, and lots of beer options. Would have gotten five stars from me but I thought the wine was a bit pricy for being more of a casual place. Will definitely be back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Had the pork meatballs and sauce over penne for lunch today. Very tasty but a little pricy. Service was great."}
{"text":"Me and a friend decided kinda last minute to go out for sum drinks. Neither of us had eaten so we ended up here. I've heard of this place but I'm not a big 'meatball' fan but thought we could just order a couple of appetizers. Well, after looking at the menu everything sounded soooo good. We got fried pickles- which is enough easily for atleast 3 people, she got a vegetarian meatball sammich, which is made of mushrooms, chickpeas and I forget what else. I got a chicken ()and cheese) meatball bowl. Yikes- so much food for 2 girls !! So, we split everything we ordered AND took a bunch home. I would no doubt eat here again. (Oh, and you can order drinks at the table or they also have a full bar as well.) 
I think this would make a fun date night."}
{"text":"Great prices, dope food, nice atmosphere, and hella friendly services. I was in Pittsburg for a long weekend for a conference and my friends took me here. I'm planning on going back for those balls."}
{"text":"Great place! The food was delicious. I went with my husband and three kids. Everyone loved their food. I had the chicken meatballs with the pesto. Yum! The Brussels sprouts as a side were also fantastic. The service was great.  Everyone left happy! The noise level is a little loud but that is to be expected. We enjoyed visiting the other two levels, each one had their special charm!"}
{"text":"Former downtown resident moved to Wexford. It is so hard to find a good restaurant to eat at in Wexford or the surrounding areas and finally there is one.

Great atmosphere, great beer, great service, great food. 

The bruschetta is excellent and the spicy pork grinder is awesome. 

I am so glad they opened this location to add some variety to the area!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It is my favorite place to go when I'm in the city! I just feel in love with the combo's that you can make here! I always get the angry birds  bowl with  mac n cheese crack sauce and govt cheese and chicken meatballs.  It is to die for! Plus the names of the meals are funny. The wait staff is very friendly too! His is a must try if your visiting Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended and we chose this place because it was a special dinner out for our grandson who LOVES meatballs but we were disappointed in the food.  

The red sauce tasted like canned lunchroom sauce. The salad had seen better days and the hand cut fries were drenched in oil. 

We'll take this off our places to re-visit.  Don't feel confident a second try would be any better."}
{"text":"I really hope management reads this.  Great food and great lighting. I will continue to go back.  The music is is great but way too too loud. I can't hear myself think.  If they would take it down a bit, it's gold.  Can feel like a college bar in suburbs."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow! Just went in today, on a Monday and took full advantage of the happy hour specials. Half priced beer and $2 sliders! The combinations available from choice of beef and delicious sauce had me craving to mix and match until I was full. Can't wait to had back tomorrow; thoroughly enjoyed the outdoor patio and atmosphere. Very impressed"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience, great atmosphere, amazing service, and a top notch meal. Defiantly must check out and will be back for sure! Also, can't forget the great beer selection."}
{"text":"Our table tried all of the meatball types, mashed potatoes, risotto, poutin  tots, and the brussel sprouts-everything was sooo overly salted.  The consistency of the meatballs was mushy...all four of us were disappointed considering this place has received other positive reviews.  Salty mush...left half our order at the table uneaten."}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place but it's just ok. The meatballs are decent but far from great. They should have copied the recipes from The Meatball Shop in NYC since it's clear that's the concept they're going for. The prices don't justify the food. The bartenders could use some training on the cocktail menu as well. Nice decor and the service is always friendly, but for a meatball place, they need better meatballs."}
{"text":"Quick and amazing service! The cheese bread appetizer was ridiculously delicious! Had the Thanksgiving turkey meatball bowl and it was good,  but wouldn't order it again.  Overall, pretty good."}
{"text":"We are in Pittsburgh for a quick weekend trip and a friend recommended this spot. Cool casual place with unique menu of meatballs and sides. Fantastic service and delicious comfort food. The managers stopped by our table a couple of times to make certain everything was great and even treated us to a free round of drinks. They don't take reservations but their waitlist app works great. Recommended."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly good. I've had many truly outstanding meals in Pittsburgh. I was willing to sacrifice a chance for another great meal for convenience and time after a long drive. The tater tot poutine with pork belly and spicy sauce was better than I expected! The dish was delicious and filling. I'm glad that I tried the restaurant and will return."}
{"text":"My family loved it at Emporio! I was seated quickly because I used the NoWait app to reserve a little ahead of time. It was a little loud but I kind of expected that with the vibe the place gives. We had the buffalo fried chicken balls with blue-cheese celery for an appetizer. They were not at all what we expected but we thought they were beyond delicious. Beware! they are for people who like spicy! All the food came out hot and in a timely manor. We tired all the meatball except the Vegetarian one and thought they were all wonderful. We were too stuffed for dessert but can't wait to try one!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent: my family are regulars and it's consistently good. My wife is very adventurous and tries everything but till now I stuck to the same dish as it was always excellent: a beef meatball panini, with arabiatta spicy sauce and smoky Gouda. But last time I tried the gyro special - it was AWESOME!

For the kids: my 5 year old loves the Wedding Soup and I'd recommend that!"}
{"text":"Sean waited on us tonight and was very nice and helpful. Recommended us a great poutine as well. Food was impeccable and we will be coming back in the near future."}
{"text":"I'm going home to yell at my mother after eating here. The meatballs were excellent and the matzo soup is the best I every had"}
{"text":"Some of the best meatballs I've ever eaten. Menu has something for everyone and the restaurant is casual and comfortable with a huge open window on the street side. 

I had the side of roasted brussel sprouts and I think they could convert any non-sprout lover. 

This place is great for singles, couples or families."}
{"text":"Our server was so nice and even allowed our ridiculous request of making our own Mimas bar at our table. (Brought out the OJ and Champaign) the menu is very interesting and a lot to choose from. If you are a fan of meatballs this is your place as you can have them anyway over anything pretty much. Highly recommend you share plates as I only had one slider and the filled me up while my friend got a two meatballs over risotto and that was enough to feed two people!"}
{"text":"Small but tasty menu. We love the poutine as an appetizer. Decent beer selection with knowledgeable bar staff."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommend by some local friends when we were visiting, and YES. The place was perfect for our Sunday brunch as we were leaving town. Our waiter was extremely nice, funny and attentive. The menu is straight forward- MEATBALLS. They have quite a variety to satisfy everyone in a group. Can't wait to come back on my next trip to PGH, hopefully for dinner next time so I can try some craft cocktails. 

Did I mention how amazing the decor is?"}
{"text":"This was a unique dining experience. They have a handful of meatball preparations  including a vegetarian. You can have these prepared traditional ways like a sandwich or unique chef inspired combos in bowls. The mixed green salad was excellent and the house Italian was amazing. We were too full for dessert . Service was excellent. The price is a bit high so I gave it four stars. Everything is a la cart so it adds up fast."}
{"text":"My buddy suggested this place while we were up visiting from Louisiana, but overall it was pretty disappointing. The chicken chili cheese fries were good, but the two sliders I had -- beef marinara and spicy pork arrabiatta -- were bland and lacking flavor."}
{"text":"Very happy with my lunch here! I've been to the rooftop bar and decided to have lunch today at Emporio. We tried a pork meatball slider, beef meatballs with the crack sauce and the meat sauce, the poutine with the chicken gravy and the baked potato bowl. Everything was good. I was worried the meatballs would be dry but they were great-- both the pork and beef, pork had a slight spice but nothing major. I saw some complaints on here about over-saucing and since I ordered 2 sauces for my balls ($.75 upcharge) the meatballs came separate from the sauce. The servers were so friendly and quick which led me to write this review. If there are any drawbacks, it would be that it is a little pricey for their concept, but if Pittsburgh is competing with other major metro areas, it's not outrageous. I'll definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Wowzers, this is a really good dinner spot. There is absolutely something for everybody here. So many different, meat, sauce, and side options that you could come here thousands.of times before repeating a meal. A great happy hour too! Half off beers and the 25 cent buffalo chicken balls. Don't forget to ask for the monthly special as well!"}
{"text":"These guys know how to do balls!!!  Best meatballs I've ever had!!! My husband thought so too!  Lol. But seriously this place is great. Our waitress was tops. The manager came over to chat with us. Very lovely and wonderful people!!! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"My fiance and i have been so excited to try this place for awhile now. The service was excellent however the food was sub par. I ordered the classic beef meat balls with cheese tortellini and parmesan sauce and she ordered the chicken meat balls with gnocci and parmesan sauce. The sauce was so thick and rich that I actually asked our waitress for some marinara to add some acidity.  BAD IDEA. The marinara was SO salty and sour. Our meat balls weren't seasoned at all and were very mushy (guessing that they were frozen) my tortellini was so mushy it actually turned to mush on the bottom of my place. Her gnocci was also mushy and flavorless. The 1 thing that I liked was their water. As odd as that sounds it was some bomb water. With a $50.00 bill it was not worth it. I actually prefer ikeas meatballs. Sorry emporio, we won't be back."}
{"text":"The tomato risotto is to die for and I love the mix and match option of the menu. they definitely have a cool atmosphere. The drink selection is ok- not many drafts to chose from.

The reason for 3 stars is that, one more than one occasion when I've come here, the service has been slow. Food is quick to come out, but the initial greeting and drinks takes far too long. We had to flag down a server to see if anyone had our table one time. We sat there for 20 minutes after being seated. I'm a stickler for first impressions at a restaurant, so that was hard to forgive."}
{"text":"Service is great. Waitress was very friendly.  Meatballs and poutine was fabulous. Subtracting one star for not being told extra charge for a small cup of sauce.  But I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This visit was my first and I would not hesitate to go back.  We were on a tight schedule to get to a show and many places had long waits.  Using yelp I place a reservation.  The desk was a little confused and couldn't find us but I showed them the text and we were on a short wait.  The confusion made me nervous but we were soon seated.  Our waitress was quick and professional. The menu is not super extensive but there was plenty for a party of four to choose from.  The meals arrived quickly and everything tasted great.   I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a slider and wedding soup.  The variety is excellent, and government cheese paired well with the meatballs on the sliders.  I'd recommend for dinner, but lunch is too long.  I waited for 50 minutes on food, and another 10 just to get someone to run our card.  If you only have an hour and a half for lunch, you should avoid this place as the service is very slow."}
{"text":"This is a unique restaurant specializing in meatballs with various choices of meats, sauces, and sides. I really enjoyed the ambience of dim lighting and the vintage decorated water glasses that were given with a personal water pitcher to pour for ourselves. There was a great selection of local craft beers to choose from and endless creative combinations for meatball entrées. I ordered a meatball grinder with original beef and creamy parmesan sauce and my spouse ordered the spicy pork meatballs over a bed of mac n cheese. We were both very impressed with the taste of everything and how friendly the staff was with any questions we had about the menu. The service was exceptionally quick for a Friday evening as well."}
{"text":"Great place. Food was really good. Great portions. Not a wide variety of meatball but the speciality balls are interesting. The side options are really goes. I suggest the tortellini. 
Service was very good. Very friendly servers."}
{"text":"Well the meatballs were above average. The arrabiata sauce was very good. I got the garlic Parmesan fries and they were OVER COOKED. The waitress never came back to check in on my table and I had to wait to more than 10 minutes for a drink refill and I had to ask someone else who works here. I had high expectations and they were not met. The restaurant was 25% full so that's not an excuse. The meatballs is the only reason it's 3/5"}
{"text":"A guilty pleasure! The pickle chips and Parmesan fries are delicious! I would be happy to just eat those. I had the panini with veggie balls, Gouda cheese and pesto. So good! My only complaint is that the pesto is too creamy. I wish they would go back to the original pesto. We have always had great service here."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere here. The food was pretty good. I got the fugetta-bowl-it. The meatballs were decent and I liked the creamy sauce on the pasta. Small portions so definitely no leftovers. I tasted their Cajun bowl which was a special at the time too and it was definitely a 10/10. The drink I ordered was pretty bad, it was some kind of creation by the guy making the drinks but I guess that's what happens sometimes. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here several times, mainly on Monday evenings, for a night out. Reason being? Well it is $2 slider night! Being that the meatballs are what we go for, this works out perfectly. Oftentimes, we will venture into trying the meatball of the month - latest being the Thanksgiving Ball served with Chicken Gravy. It was delish! I haven't had a combination I haven't liked to this date. I will say my favorite combo is the Chicken Ball with Pesto - it is hard to beat. 

The real reason we come to Emporio is for the Ricotta Donuts. We do not get them every time, but this is one (unexpected) place where we will order dessert on a fairly regular occasion.

Now, why three stars? I will give this place props on great service, when it comes to the waiters and waitresses. However, we have not had a hostess that is welcoming and greeting us with a smile. If this is the face of your restaurant, wouldn't you want someone with a little enthusiasm greeting your guests? In addition, the prices on a regular night at this place are pretty expensive; hence, the reason for our Monday night outings. We usually get enough food and come out with a reasonably priced bill but any other night would be more pricey, especially if we dove into the main courses, sides, and drinks. 

All in all, we will be back, especially to try their \"Ball of the Month\" and to drown ourselves in chocolate with a side of Ricotta Donut."}
{"text":"Meat and carbs --- how can you not love this place? Ron Swanson, or any other comparable meat enthusiast, would indeed be proud that a place like this exists.  As the name of the restaurant suggests, Emporio: A Meatball Joint specializes in meatballs. You can combine your meatballs with one of many carbolicious sides which include Mac & cheese, Parmesan-Herb fries, tater tots, Penne pasta, and many other healthier and non-healthier (read: heart attack inducing) sides.  I went there on a Wednesday afternoon for lunch and had the special for the day which was a chicken jalapeño cheddar meatball. I ordered two meatballs (you could order more than just two) with a side of Parmesan-Herb French fries.  Although I pride myself in being able to finish my dishes, in part to avoid wasting food and in part because I love food, I can honestly say that I was unable to finish my meal.  Yep, I was defeated by meatballs.  The total price for the special two meatballs with sauce and Parmesan herb fries was about $14.00 (not including tip).  I think for the portion size and the quality of taste, the price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"We don't go to Wexford a lot, but had passed this place twice before, so this time we saw it at lunch time and my wife googled the website real fast, and it looked good, so we decided to turn around.  From the web page, we almost thought it was going to be like a Chipotle style place where you just went down the line, picked your meatball, got some sauce on it, then took it to your seat.  This was a sit down place though with a full bar.  No big deal, it wasn't busy at all when we got there around noon, so we got seated immediately.  

The few people that were there when we got there were clearly hipster types, and so were many of the employees working there.  The place was also decorated very trendy, and they served you water in a big glass bottle they left on your table.  At this point, I was worried about how the food was going to be, since I've been to places like this before, like Burgatory where the food takes a back seat to the vibe of the place.  

The menu was simple, pretty much all you can order is meatballs, some sides, and some apps, but that's it.  No big deal on that as we went for the meatballs.  They had 4 types of meatballs on the menu, and she also mentioned they had a Cod meatball for lent.  They had a bunch of different sauces you could put on the meatballs, and then you can have them just as meatballs, or as a slider, sandwich, or panini.  I chose to have the sliders, because I wanted to try a few different meatballs and sauces.  I had the turkey meatball, the classic meatball, and the spicy pork meatball.  My wife had 2 classic meatball sliders, and we had the Parmesan fries to split.  

Well, as expected, the food was fine, but nothing special.  The meatballs were actually kind of bland, only helped by the sauce you picked to put on them.  My wife said the same thing.  My wife has an Italian mother who makes home made meat balls, so we know what good meat balls taste like, and unfortunately, these just didn't do it for us.  The fries weren't bad.  About what you'd expect Parmesan fries to taste like anywhere.

The service was really great, so that's not reason not to go there, and the prices were also really good, as all the sandwiches were less than $10.  The sides were $5, but they are huge.  We split the fries, and couldn't even finish them.  I'd almost suggest they offer half portions for $3.50 or so, because if you can't decide on a side to split, you definitely don't want to order a whole side for yourself.

Overall, I'd say go there once for yourself and see if you like it.  I mean the food wasn't bad and the service was great, but for a place that only serves meatballs, I'd expect them to be amazing."}
{"text":"Can't really go into detail but this place is really great. The meatballs are nice and soft. Taste really good. Now they give you a lot of options in that the meatballs aren't just beef, there's pork, chicken, etc. It is a very nice, customizable menu in that you can get the balls on a panini or a grinder, a top risotto, or by itself. It is really a modern concept that facilitates you trying a lot of stuff especially if it's your first time."}
{"text":"I've been twice and enjoyed it both times. The first time was just a couple of weeks following the opening. And with a line out the door they managed to look like they had been in business for awhile. Well done.
We sat at the bar and the bartender was great. The food is good. The menu is simple. Perhaps a bit pricey relatively though."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, ample portions, flavorful entrees and sauces, friendly service. The ample combinations that can be made make this place a great repeat option so you can try them all. My favorite was the veggie meatballs and Greek style dressing on a hoagie roll. Convenient location for lunch downtown."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place as I do love a good meatball.  Unfortunately, the meatball was the worst part.  

We went on a Saturday around 6pm, there was no wait and we were seated immediately.  Our server was very friendly, prompt and knowledgeable.  I ordered beef saucy balls in marinara on top of mashed potatoes, my bf ordered beef ball grinder with provolone cheese and a side of hand cut French fries.  The French fries (although overly salted) were the best part of the meal.  The meatballs tasted like pure salt, at first I couldn't figure out if it was my mashed potatoes or the meatballs, until my bf took a bite of his and asked me if the meatballs were salty.  I'm not talking a seasoning of salt, I mean it was like licking a salt stick or someone dumped a whole container of salt in the meatballs.  The fries and the mashed potatoes were also overly salted but were still somewhat edible.  

The manager did come to our table and asked how everything was, and I was honest about the salt.  He proclaimed that maybe I had eaten a bite of meatball that wasn't mixed very well.  So I let him go on his way, if he wasn't willing to see that maybe there was a problem with over-salting then there was no point in talking to him.  I just pleasantly smiled and nodded. 

The reason for the 2 stars, is because of the wait staff, or I would easily give 1 star.  They were always attentive and on top of things.  I would try this place again if I found out they fixed something on their menu. 


It seems like recent reviews agree, hopefully management takes these into consideration into fixing something?"}
{"text":"We loved going to Sienna Mercato downtown & were so happy to hear they were building another restaurant in Wexford close to home.

We went on the first night and even then they were super organized and on their game. Even visiting twice since they were still on their game.

From the hostess to the wait staff everyone is super friendly. The food is spectacular.

We ordered the following for four people to share and everything was delicious:
- poutine
- tomato risotto
- saucy balls (one that was a Thanksgiving special that was Thanksgiving in a ball & beef with marinara)
- my husband also had matzo ball soup & loved it

I highly encourage everyone to try it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I like the idea of a meatball joint. The atmosphere is really casual and adding the different elements with the bar upstairs is pretty nice. 
We had a large group of 10, so we had to wait about 45 to get seated but it was a Saturday night so we expected that. 
Everyone ordered their own thing and I didn't get to really ask everyone but I ordered a chicken ball and a vegetarian ball with government cheese over green beans with almonds . It was very good! The balls are pretty large and super different. The vegetarian ball was a little dry for my taste but the cheese made it more moist. The green beans were crisp and had a nice crunch. The almonds were crunchy and there were a lot . It was a great addition. 
I enjoyed my meal and our server was super nice !"}
{"text":"Yummm. Ok so I've been here before, but I came tonight with my family for kids night. Kids eat 1/2 off and there is a balloon and face painting artist. My kids had a blast and are already asking to come back. 

I normally order a bowl-my favorite is the angry birds bowl with chicken meatballs over pasta with crack sauce. Omg the crack sauce is incredible. But tonight I ordered the wedge salad with a chicken meatball, and I don't think I'll be able to order anything else again. It was perfection. Their ranch dressing is bomb and the bacon and hard boiled eggs with the meatball was sooo good. The meatballs are super juicy and moist on the inside and just the right amount of crispy on the outside. My kids devoured their meals and said that was the best Mac n cheese and meatballs they'd ever eaten, and kids are Mac n cheese experts, so I believe them. Always always order a side of tater tots. Best tots ever. They are super crispy but not greasy. 

I'm so glad we have an Emporio in the suburbs. It's a really cool spot with large garage doors opening up in the front area by the bar and the back area on the porch. The Wednesday night kids night will be a routine for my family."}
{"text":"If you want meatballs stop at Subway instead where at least they are warm. Nothing really special about the place other then over priced simple menu with poor service. Staff doesn't seem to know how to use No Wait so expect to have problems. Definitely not ideal for kids."}
{"text":"When in Pittsburgh, you gotta head to Emporio, meatball joint. Try all types of meatballs with sauce choices and they are to die for."}
{"text":"this place is all kids and families. Food was great but definitely not the same crowd or vibe from downtown location."}
{"text":"This is such a great concept for a restaurant. At first I was skeptical because I was never a fan of traditional meatballs. But this place is kickass. Food is amazing, atmosphere is cool, and the staff is so friendly. I took my brother here last time he visited and he still obsesses over how good this place was!! I also love the sense of humor they have with the brand. The meatball mascot at the beerfest was funny."}
{"text":"Food was really good. The venue was confusing. Signs on the front sidewalk indicate Sienna Mercato, but small sign says Emporio. We were unsure if we were at the correct restaurant at first sight. Several persons standing inside confirming reservations and the no wait lists. We were not sure with whom to check in? Sure enough, we were wating in the wrong line. After waiting there, the hostess directed us to the correct host. Wait staff was friendly, but never checked to see if we needed anything else! We asked for our check and it took 20 mins to get it. Seems a little disorganized. I would give it one more try on a less busy night."}
{"text":"I haven't a clue why or how this place stays in business. The place is dark. I guess so you can't see what your eating. I went there for the first time and I still can't believe that I paid $55.00 for 3 meatballs with tatter tots and two meatball sliders. Lousy food, service and OMG overpriced"}
{"text":"Awesome meatballs!

Emporio can be a bit confusing to find... it is one of the three restaurants at Sienna Mercato: Emporio is the meatball shop on the first floor; Mezzo is a classic Italian restaurant on the second floor; Il tetto is the beer garden on the third floor.

My friend and I walked in for lunch thinking we were at Mezzo, which turns out to only open for dinner. Thankfully, we were blessed by discovering this gem. We each ordered a meatball slider ($3.5) + side pasta ($5.5); we also shared a rocket salad ($6). At first, the portion looked small, but the food was surprising very filling and tasty!

Will come back here for the saucy balls!

{"text":"Great beer selection, and MEATBALLS!  Yea!  I tried the spicy sausage meatball appetizer ($8 bucks).  Flavor was good, enough to serve as a light meal.  Added in a couple of Yuenglings, and boom!  Great meal!

Fella behind the bar was super friendly, and generally provided a great experience.  I'll be in the area on business fairly often, and will plan on making this a regular stop."}
{"text":"Wish I had more stars for this place! 5 is not enough. I love the vibe, the food is top notch and the beer selection is unmatched!! I really liked the outside seating with the string lights.  It was perfect for a summer evening. We started with the poutine, my favorite food. It was stupendous. I ordered the panini with two chicken meat balls, smoked Gouda, and pesto cream sauce and it was BOMB!! My husband had the grinder with beef meatballs and provolone cheese. My kid had a slider with government cheese and he loved that as well. Our server, Bruce, was so knowledgeable about the menu and he was great at making sure we knew how to order and the portion sizes for each option. I will definitely come back to this place!!!"}
{"text":"Staring out the from the balcony while partaking in a drink is the best view ever. However if you aren't hungry for a meatball then it doesn't really matter. Last time I was here it was a Mexican restaurant and you could munch down the free salsa and chips while nursing a beer. I wonder what happened to place"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Great atmosphere, excellent food, and as someone with celiac disease meatballs are a rare treat. Try the chicken balls over cheddar potatoes with the arrabiata."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4-5 times. Always great service. Tasty food and great alcohol selection. I had saucy balls over escarole and beans tonight and was so happy with the spicy flavor. These people know their meatballs. My friend who was a vegetarian loved her choice with mushroom sauce as a panini. Great bar too!"}
{"text":"They have varieties of delicious meatball selection! Nice bar and TVs for game day ! Good place to hang out with friends and family ! This place is pack on friday night so book your table ahead of time !"}
{"text":"Went there with my friend Janet.. We had the Buffalo Chicken Balls and WOW they totally rocked!! Also had the Government Mac and Cheese... Excellent! Can't wait to go there with my boyfriend!!!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the options and simplicity of this dining experience.  The options are unlimited.  Overall great variety of drinks and food.  Wonderful service!   Noise level is loud when the place is busy.   Will return for more meatballs!!"}
{"text":"This place is no joke. They are the experts on meatballs. This would definitely be a guilty pleasure if I was in the area more often, I recommend it. Variations of meatballs to suit most dietary restrictions and sauces for all tastes. The mac and cheese and the fried pickles are some of the apps/sides my group and I got and they were gone in seconds. The restaurant also has this rugged barn feel to it that suits the environment. Definitely should check this place out if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"What a great spot to grab dinner. Our waiter was amazing and personable. I took his recommendation for my meal and was not disappointed. I am not even really sure what I had, except that it was phenomenal. My wife had the chicken meatballs and the side of brussel sprouts. The sprouts were amazing. 

We also had our three year old along, and she found something to eat easily. She loves meatballs and pasta. The waiter did great with her and they moved our food out very quickly. What an awesome spot for dinner, even with a family. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Huge selection of beer (and a beautiful rooftop beer garden upstairs!) Endless combinations of meatballs (even different flavors and types of meatballs) with mashed potatoes, tater tots, and more. It did get super hot when I was here on a summer day though."}
{"text":"Ordered a Patron margarita. It came in a really small glass with a lot of ice for $11. I forgot to tell the server I don't like salt on the rim of the glass however, a good server would have asked if I wanted it or not. I wouldn't order another margarita because it was sour and bland, my sister agreed and was glad she'd changed her mind on ordering one for herself. My brother-in-law and I had the 'special' Buffalo Fried Chicken Balls. The meatball itself was fine but in no way did the sauce taste like buffalo sauce. it tasted sweet, like a sweet barbecue with a hint of spice. We also had the dill pickle chips which were good, but we all decided we have had better. It's served with bacon ranch dip which is very bacon-y. I didn't care for it so asked for regular ranch dressing and was told if I kept the bacon ranch drsg there would be a 75 cent upcharge for the regular ranch. If she took the bacon ranch drsg away, no up-charge. I can't remember having ever been to another restaurant that has the same policy. The Parmesan-herb French fries, although it's easy to see Parmesan cheese on them the taste was very faint. The menu should state one order of fries is enough for 2 because we ended up wasting the equivalent of 1 order when we had ordered 2. I also ordered the spicy sausage meatball (1) with marinara, peppers & onions. That was good. As we were leaving we saw someone with a meatball grinder. It was huge, definitely enough for 2 and did look good but..."}
{"text":"Went there Friday night for the first time, doubtful we will be going back unless its for drinks during happy hour. Happy Hour prices are great!

Wendy, our server, was fantastic! Great personality and very helpful with suggestions and what all of our options were. 

Food came out way too fast for us, so quickly that when we normally would have had a 2nd drink before dinner, we didn't because there wasn't time to finish the first one. We did not like it being served in a metal bowl (reminded us of a dog dish). We tried the \"Angry Birds\" and Beef and Pork Balls in meat sauce w/tomato risotto. Food was ok, nothing spectacular and not something we will rush back for."}
{"text":"Order for lunch: beef meatball panini, arugula salad with chicken meatball, beef meatball slider with marinara , 2 kids spaghetti with beef meatball. 
Diners for lunch: 3 adults and two kids under 6.

Service seated by manager and given water and menus by him. Didn't see a server for about 15+ minutes in a not crowded restaurant.

Wife liked the arugula salad because it came with slivered almonds. 

Outside of that the chicken meatball is the best of the three. One of adults in group that had been there before said they thought the pork meatball was the weakest of the 3. 

The beef meatball and marinara is greatly underwhelming considering size and price. Marinara is very much like what I can buy at grocery store. 

I fully expected a MEATBALL PLACE to have meatballs in their wedding soup. Instead, what I got was essentially a big bowl of spinach in a good chicken broth, some pastina, Parmesan and two small pieces of chicken. No meatballs at all. 

IMHO this place is greatly overpriced for the hit and miss quality and the amount of food. The meatballs are not elevated in presentation nor flavor profile. Our cost with tip to feed two kids ages 6&4, 2 light eating adults (1 small meatball a piece) and one additional adult that had the panini was ::::   Just under $60.

I would give 3 stars for the hit or miss food and slow service but the price lowers that one more. Won't be going back, at least not by my own choice."}
{"text":"We visited \"Emporio, a meatball joint\" in Wexford on 6/27/18 around 8 PM.  The gentleman who greeted us at the door was very friendly and welcoming.  We were shown to seating in an outer area with a view of the highway which is okay with me as I am no conversationalist.  (I like watching traffic go by).  Anyways, the waitress (Bailey) was also very friendly and sufficiently attentive.  We ordered...meatballs.  I had the chicken meatball panini which was tasty but wasn't squished with lines in the bread like a panini.  It was more like a small sub with really thin bread.  Chicken gravy for dipping was good.  The Poutine I ordered as an appetizer/side was also okay, but the cheese did not appear to be curds as it should be be.  I guess you don't get real poutine outside Canada.  My daughter, who is vegan ordered the vegan meatballs.  She wasn't a fan.  She asked all in the party to try them.  They were good as far as flavor but the texture was not good, in fact it was off putting.  It was very sticky...kind of like a paste.  They did offer to take them off the bill to make it right.  So, the staff is friendly and attentive, the food is adequate (not the vegan meatballs), prices are on the high side for what you get, so I give it 3 stars as a average place to eat.  Nothing to make me come back."}
{"text":"Emporios...as they say, A Meatball Joint..unfortunately we had to 'wait' because they had NO beef meatballs made!!!  WTF!?  How can a Meatball Joint have no beef meatballs made? Its lunchtime people, get on the ball...no pun intended. 
The Brushetta was excellent, but im still confused as to why there were no beef meatballs made. This made lunch a lot longer than it should have been. Because of that, I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"Yummy!   Great service from knowledgeable staff who helped guide us in our choices!   
Very good food!"}
{"text":"First time here. Overwhelming options, they do have some options for bowls that were delicious. Angry Birds was yummy. Wish you could taste all the sauces beforehand. Big beer selection. Will come back. They use the No Wait app. Waitress said they do get busy at prime time."}
{"text":"After eating at the downtown location a few times and thoroughly enjoying myself, I was thrilled when I got to choose where birthday lunch was for three of us in my office last Tuesday.  It wasn't very busy during the lunch hour - maybe a few other tables, so we were seated right away on the covered patio that overlooked 19.  My dad and his business partner had never been before, and our waiter did a good job with describing how to order and offering recommendations for which pairings of balls and sauces worked best.

The menu does seem limited, however with the amount of sauces and meatball variety PLUS how they can be ordered (many people don't know you can get just the ball and sauce in a bowl or you can get any meatball over any side they offer) Emporio really does provide a variety.

I always choose the vegetarian ball with the parmesan sauce (I'm not a vegetarian.  it's just THAT good.) over the Tater Tot Poutine.  I normally get it over broccoli.  I am always worried two meatballs wont be enough, and end up never being able to finish both.  

Dad ordered two sliders and one just plain meatball with sauce in a bowl.  His business partner ordered two sliders.  No complaints from either.

I didn't catch our servers name but he was attentive and really outgoing.  He took good care of us during lunch and we were in and out in under an hour.  Really cool spot (maybe not for lunch all the time) but even to take a client out to lunch somewhere different.  Interior Is industrial...clean and cool.  Big fan - wouldn't mind coming to this location at night for drinks, too."}
{"text":"Fantastic eats! The ball of the month never disappoints. Convenient and fast! One of the few options in town on weekends and good value."}
{"text":"Simple. Balls in a bowl. A troll will deliver them to your table. Badabing badaboom. 20 bux and you're outta there. Straight forward bland food boring concept."}
{"text":"Our first visit here with our daughter was on 3/31/17. 
We were greeted with a smile & taken to a booth. 
Our server Wendy, was amazing. So friendly, helpful, knowledgeable & attentive. We went with several of her recommendations. 
We started off with the Poutine. Delicious. 
I had the B.O.M. which was a jambalaya meatball with lobster cream sauce over Cajun rice. 
Our other entrees consisted of the spicy pork, vegetarian & chicken meatballs. Our sauces included the pesto, Crack sauce & lobster cream sauce. Sides were their Mac n Cheese (omg) & their risotto. 
The food is amazing. Not your average meatballs. 
Very impressed with the entire experience. 
We will definitively be back."}
{"text":"The place had a relaxed atmosphere with nice outdoor seating and an open-air bar.

Food was below average. The meatballs were oddly soft and mushy with no real flavor. Every entree ordered at our table was completely drowned in sauce. I'm a sauce girl too but this was just ridiculous.  I got the cheese sauce which I was pretty excited about; only to be completely disappointed within a few minutes of the food arriving.  The velveeta-like, cheese sauce had congealed and became goopy. 

The one positive that could bring me back were the brussel sprouts. Those were awesome. I give the brussel sprouts alone, 4 stars."}
{"text":"Enjoying a great dining experience, Sonja the waitress is excellent.  She suggested our dinner combinations.  The staff and service is as excellent, the manager Tyler greeted is so warmly we will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to the bars on the first and third floors many times before, but I had never eaten anything here until last night.  I was definitely missing out!  The service was great, ambiance was cool and laid back.  I got the vegan meatball slider with the very aptly named \"crack sauce\" and it was delicious (although the texture of the vegan meatball was a little pasty, but i can't hold that against anyone who can transform vegetables into a meatball that actually stays together!) I got the brussels sprouts as my side, but the portion was big enough for an appetizer for two!  They were awesome, though, as was the poutine!  For dessert, we had the chocolate chip cookies, which tasted okay and had a nice texture, but they were served cold.. it might have been a game changer if they had been warm!"}
{"text":"It was alright. Overall, I would go again as a vegan who wants to hang out with omnivores, but I would not order the veggie meatballs!! Worth a try though.

+ vegan options; eg veggie balls, gravy fries, gravy over green beans...
+ mushroom gravy is pretty tasty 
+ service was friendly 

- veggie meatballs were gross. I haven't eaten meat in many years so I'm used to meat substitutes, but I could not handle the texture of these. If it's your first time give them a try but maybe just the order of two or the single meatball slider. 
- while friendly, server was a bit inattentive. She basically ghosted after we got our food."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I gave Emporio a taste after a show at the Benedum and we were not disappointed. The size of the meatballs are quiet large and there are plenty of ways to change it up. Classic meatballs to chicken (my favorite), spicy pork, and vegan. Plus you have numerous sauces to try as well as sides to put your meatballs with other than traditional pasta. Kind of pricy for meatballs but it's a must try."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, I'm in love with....balls. Yes, the joke was there so it had to be said. 

Found this place while searching of all places, Yelp and decided to give it a shot. Located in a mini mall of sorts it was not super busy on a Tuesday night which was ok. I went to the bar and the adorable bartender offered me some samples and explained the menu. 

SOOOO MANY CHOICES. I'm a girl who has a hard time deciding what lipstick to wear so picking out meat, sauce, etc. The combinations were nearly endless. 

I settled on the ball of the month, Thanksgiving themed of course...Turkey, cranberries and stuffing over white cheddar mashed potatoes and chicken gravy. They were....PERFECT. 

Combine that with the huge tap selection and you can't go wrong. Check them out if you're ever in the area!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place mainly bc it had GF options for the hubby.  The turkey meatballs were very good and tender despite being GF.  However, the pricing was a little too much for what you get and the appetizer I had was too greasy.

The staff was pleasant and the atmosphere was ok.  I hated the bar stools at the bar (not comfortable at all). If you want fancy balls (meatballs perv), try it out. They have great combinations for sauce and meatballs. But don't be a Sally and try to create your own thing, they don't like that...(explanation: I wanted the appetizer ground chicken meatballs as an entree with the entree options).  Sorry, but I am a firm believer in making the customer happy and if you have the stuff to make it, what's the problem???"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere here and very friendly service. A great beer selection as well. There are three floors of this place and there's a cool beer garden on the top floor. All of the meatballs were very good and the matzoh ball soup was OK - the balls were a little drier than I'd like. Worth stopping by if you're here. We used the Yelp call ahead feature which minimized the wait."}
{"text":"If my critique was only about the service and presentation, I'd probably give 5 stars, but let's face it, the most important component at a restaurant is how good the food tastes.  On that they get 3 stars and those are the only stars that count.  The veggie balls were mushy and over-spiced, the beef balls were only acceptable and the cowardly wedding soup had no balls at all, unless you paid extra for them.  Long story short, if you want great meatballs, come to my house because I make them better!  DISCLAIMER: You're not really invited to my house for meatballs."}
{"text":"Food was good. Irony is we had wedding soup as a starter and it had no meatballs.   Wait staff was lacking on attentiveness.  Only matched by the manager who walked by four times and did not ask how our meals was or at least thank us for choosing their restaurant.  Lastly having shaved cheese added to our meal was an uncharacteristic up-charge."}
{"text":"First of all, I've been here LOTS of times. I first came when they originally opened and I was a vegetarian. The veg meatballs are fantastic and I was thrilled to have a delicious option. The spinach almond pesto was inane good and llthe meatball became the delivery vehicle for this unbelievable sauce. I was also fond of the taziki sauce. Both so fresh, light, and full of flavor.  And their rocket salad was always my favorite.  This was definitely a 5 star place at this point.

Then this one day, when I decided I was really to lose my vegetarian virginity, I chose the Meatball Joint to do so. The bartender was so excited for me and really helped me do it up ïright. I noticed the spinach almond pesto was no longer on the menu, but there was a basil cream, and I thought that sounded fantastic.

I got 4 beef meatballs, one with basil cream, one with arrabiata, and one with mushroom gravy. They were delicious, but I was also intoxicated.

I have since gone back several times, sober, and I have to say, their sauce options are many, but they are all so thick and heavy and they just don't excite me. I've begged many times to bring the spinach almond pesto back and the manager has said he hears that multiple times a day. So why do you keep this flavorless basil cream?

Additionally, I went with a friend not long ago and he ordered tots with a bbq chicken (flavor of the month) meatball on top. They brought fries with a completely naked ball on top. We asked and they said that when people order that way they leave the sauce off.  WTH?!?! That's the whole reason he ordered it in the first place, for the BBQ sauce!!!

Basically, it's not that exciting anymore and in my opinion has gone from a fun, yummy place, to an average place that will fulfill potential future intoxicated needs. That's really not great."}
{"text":"Very fun place :) The menu is well set up and easy to follow - seems to be able to cater to many tastes! Came here with two friends before seeing a show at the Benedum on a weeknight. We were able to be seated relatively quickly and the service was quick. Our only complaint was how dim the lighting was in the area - we were in the back near the elevators, and needed some extra lighting just to see the menu. Eventually, our eyes adjusted and we placed our orders. I ordered the spicy meatballs over tortellini, one friend got the meatballs over mac & cheese, and another decided on two meatballs over tots with crack sauce.

The food arrived very quickly and we were able to dig in! The meatballs were a pretty good size and had great flavor. Between the three of us, we were able to try the pork and chicken meatballs and enjoyed both types. I enjoyed how the menu allows each person to customize the dish to their liking. The tortellini, mac & cheese, & tots were all prepared well and extremely filling. Given that we were about to go sit through a show, we didn't want to be too full, but the serving size seemed very adequate for a hearty meal."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and certainly not going to be my last. How would have thought meatballs would be so delicious. There are so many options to mix and match meatballs with sauces and sides. We ended up getting 4 meatballs meals which turns out to be pretty expensive when it come for bill time. When we go back I will be looking to get their bowl options it's cheaper and less food. But still very happy with our food and service staff was fantastic."}
{"text":"Meatballs.. your style! A superb concept plus the veggie meatball option renders me a fan! At Emporio, you get to choose your meatball type, pick the accompanying sauce and decide to enjoy them as sliders or a panini or over pasta. My veggie meatball+Arrabiata sauce slider was delish! I also ordered a side of the tomato risotto which was fantastic. Warm and creamy, it certainly hit the spots for me that cold afternoon. The portion sizes of their sides and bowls are rather generous. Don't plan on going back to work after lunch at Emporio. My risotto was quite heavy and I definitely needed a nap after my meal. If you're not feeling like meatballs (who are you!?!), their menu also has multiple soup and salad options. You can even add a meatball to your salad! They've a decent draft list but I went with their sangria that day which was also pretty good. I definitely will be going back coz where else in Pittsburgh will you find veggie meatballs! And all those sauce options...mmmm! They have happy hour specials every weekday from 4-6.. WIN!"}
{"text":"The meatballs are pretty good. Been here a few times and the food is consistent. Worth the trip"}
{"text":"I'm giving them 5 stars because the food was great and the service was exceptional! Shout out to Tyler who really took care of us.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting.  We had the wedge salad and Italian salad to start.  Both were fresh and a great portion.  For dinner I had the beef meatball panini with marinara.  The bread to meat ratio was perfect and I liked the sauce on the side so I could control it.  My hubby had the spicy pork meatballs with a spicy red sauce and although he said they weren't that spicy (lie!) I think a normal human would find them extremely spicy.  We also had a side of escarole and beans which I enjoyed.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The gimmick here is meatballs. But once you exhaust those options, there is nothing there. Choose your ball (meat of some type or vegetarian) and the vehicle by which you'll receive it sandwich slider pastas and on and on. And choose one sauce the problem is that none of the sauces have much flavor.  also the veggie meatball is a dense mass of mess.  Appetizers are extremely limited. Do not get cheesy garlic bread.  It lacks garlic and is otherwise just dumb.  They have a good salad with mozzarella.  Meat eaters at my table were content with their choices. The fries and tater tot's are both really good. Oh and they upcharge for everything even croutons!   Just do a one and done here. After that you will have exhausted the menu."}
{"text":"Warning, if you want a meal do not go to the 3rd floor. They serve appetizers, not the full menu.

Warning, you can seat yourself during the weeknight, just not on the weekend which me and my party of 4 found out when a hostess walked up and told us we have to give our name. It probably would've been better if we were told after showing ID.

We only stopped in due to the Jazz Fest. Don't know if I would come back on the weekend, no organization.."}
{"text":"Stopped in at Emporio for lunch yesterday (Saturday) and was pleasantly surprised to find it wasn't packed. We were seated right away at a booth by the bar.
The server was pleasant and prompt. We ordered drinks and reviewed the menu. When she arrived back at the table with the beverages we ordered our meals.
We both got the paninis. I ordered the standard meatballs with provolone cheese and marinara. My hubby got the spicy pork meatballs with provolone and the Aribata sauce.
The sandwiches were the perfect lunch size and came with the sauce as a sidecar. It was an excellent feature as sauce on a panini can cause it to be mushy. However our sandwiches were nice and crispy with the cheese melted perfectly.
We had an all around great meal for a Saturday lunch. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"A lot to like about Emporio. The open air atmosphere makes it a perfect spot on a nice summer night. This is my 2nd trip here and I wanted to ensure the 1st wasn't a fluke before I reviewed it. Thankfully, it was not a fluke. 

For a starter, my wife and I split the poutine with gravy-- arguably the best part of the meal. It was outstanding! I opted for the meatball of the month which was the stuffed pepper meatball which I got served on a grinder. Really good and flavorful. I got mac n cheese with parmesan cheese as my side at it was definitely the weakest point of the meal, but still ok. 

My wife got a traditional beef meatball over tortellini and she all good things to say about it. 

A great beer and wine selection to compliment the great food makes Emporio a must visit for me."}
{"text":"The meatballs were even better than I imagined. Juicy, savory, and delicious. OMG the tater tots, broccoli, bolognese sauce! Great bar selection, fantastic Old Fashioned, yum. Little one loved wedding soup and mac and cheese as well as meatballs. They encouraged us to get samples from the great beer selection, no problem."}
{"text":"Okay, who doesn't like meatballs? Everyone loves meatballs! What better than picking the type of meatballs and the sauce?! That's exactly what you can do here. You can pick between the type of meatballs (beef, pork, vegetarian, chicken) and the sauce (too many to list). I couldn't make up my mind so I went with one of their suggested combination, Thatsa-Spicy-Meat-a-Ball. The pork meatballs were juicy and delicious. The cheese tortellini were a good compliment to the meatballs. The spicy arrabbita sauce with sliced up jalapenos really brought everything together. This is not a dish for someone that cannot handle heat. It is spicy but it is just oh-so-good spicy.
My better half ordered the Angry birds. The crack sauce is freaking awesome. It really makes you wanting more long after the dish is finished and licked clean.
Each of these came with two meatballs and you are able to add on more meatballs if you like. For us, two meatballs were the perfect amount.
I washed it all down with a Victory Kirsch Gose, a sour beer.
They do have late night happy hour starting at 930pm as well."}
{"text":"Our group of seven was in town from Colorado to see the Steeler game.  Wandering down Penn Ave on the way back to our hotel, we were looking for something to eat.  Not many places were open when we came across Emporio.  I was somewhat skeptical of a meatball restaurant, but we went in anyway.  Loved the open air concept, the cleanliness and the service.  I had the City of Champyinz (great self deprecating humor) and loved it.  Meatballs, spaghetti with chicken chile and scallions (nice touch for a little crunch).  Never thought about spaghetti with chile, but I do now.  So much so that I think I'm going to have to cook up some chile for my spaghetti!  

Too bad I'm a long way from Pittsburgh and can't easily swing by for some meatballs until our next Steeler game."}
{"text":"Ok, full disclosure, I love meatballs.  Having grown up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood in New Jersey, I can say I know a good meatball.  So, my last day in Pittsburgh, I decided to try this meatball joint.  I ordered the forgetaboutit bowl with two meatballs.  I added two more so I could try all the meat ones.  There was an option for a vegetarian meatball, but what's the point.  My favorite meatball was the standard beef, second was the spicy pork, third their special which had pepperoni and lastly the chicken.  All the meatballs except the beef, seemed overly salty, especially the special.  The chicken was a tad rubbery.  Overall the pasta was served hot and the dish was bold and flavorful.  My server was Kasjah and she was very attentive.  My only suggestion is there's so many flavors with the sauces and shaved Parmesan, there's no need to overly salt the meatball.  I'd still give this joint a try, especially if you love meatballs"}
{"text":"Great layout makes this place a fun place to go.  

Something different in the land of burger joints. 

Service was prompt and friendly. 

Seating around a cool bar, booths or along the outside pavilion which in nice weather looks like it's open air. 

Enjoyed chicken meatballs in a spicy marinara sauce with grated cheese for a buck extra - but hey, it's Fathers Day, so the sky's the limit.  

I would definitely come back and order their fries  that sounded tasty."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars for the draft beer list alone, though the food was a bit of a disappointment. It was fun to try vegetarian meatballs, but they were pretty unremarkable (and so was the arrabiata sauce). My friends were for pretty unimpressed with the pork and chicken meatballs."}
{"text":"My go to resturant in Pittsburgh. Friends and family always love it. This month is a buffalo chicken with the most amazing sauce ever! The crack fries are the absolute best things I have had there yet! You need to go and get these while they are available!"}
{"text":"After seeing the \"Meatballs coming soon\" sign on route 19 for a couple of months my appetite was sufficiently whetted to try this place soon after they opened. So we stopped in here this past week for a late (1:30) lunch. We were seated promptly but never saw a server until I got so impatient I had to get up and go find one. Ok, a startup hiccup I'll overlook for now. The space is quite nice and the bar has about 30 beers on tap plus a root beer which I think is a good touch. And I only saw 2 light beers! Sweet!! Don't waste tap space with light beers! 

Once over the server issue, we each ordered the saucy balls - 4 meatballs in a bowl essentially. I chose the classic beef and my dining companion opted for the spicy pork. Both were quite good and flavorful. My pork bolognese sauce was a clear miss though - the nutmeg taste was overwhelming to the point of bringing the whole experience down a notch. Don't order it unless you LOVE nutmeg. I'd prefer it in my pumpkin pie, not my meatballs. The spinach almond pesto sauce sounded really good but is served cold. Still good but would be far better served warm. 4 meatballs is a pretty hefty portion and we left quite full I must say. 

I'll give them credit for offering quite a few vegetarian options! After all, this is a \"meatball\" place and you wouldn't think it's vegetarian friendly but it is. 

Overall, I like it here and will return. But you have to want meatballs. Not sure how often I'll fall into that mode but when I do, I know where to get them."}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch in town. You have to order their mac and cheese as a side dish no matter what! I usually get the saucy balls and mac and cheese as a side and it's a great portion of food. Their marinara sauce is great."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the service is normally great, but occasionally the hostesses are a bit rude."}
{"text":"Super meatballs all around! Had the Beef Meatball panini, chicken Parm balls, Tater got poutine, Gnocchi side... amazing food all around. Check out the pics and come try out your favorite Meatball Combo."}
{"text":"I really do like this place! I've been a few times for dinner but I went today for take out. The meatballs are extremely flavorful. You'll be hard pressed to find a better meatball. I like that they have several meat and sauce options. Today I got a classic beef meatball with meat sauce on a slider and a side of mac n cheese. Okay let me just say this mac n cheese is one of my all time favorites!! It is so creamy and good. They have two flavors...I always get the government cheese flavor. It is to die for! You have to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour!!! On Wednesday's and Thursday they have a late night happy hour that includes $5 poutine, half off drafts and &.50 buffalo meatballs. Their meatballs are delicious."}
{"text":"Really bad experience at Emporio. It was a disaster!

I've never in my life had a meatball joint that tried to charge me for sauce...this place tried, it wasn't successful. 

I also mentioned it to the manager on duty and he seemed like he couldn't care less. 

Won't be going back, believe me!!

Sad & Pathetic at best...save your money from this joke of an establishment."}
{"text":"My son has been raving about is place since it opened.  He finally convinced me to go (of course I needed to fed him too!).  I had the pita style meatball sandwich and was told to get the parmesan cheese dipping sauce.  I will say I was pleasantly surprised at how good this sandwich was. The roll was just the right blend of crispness and softness.  The sandwich was also just the right size.  The service was very good as well.  They have a nice bar at this place too!  I would definitely recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Trendy-yes
Decent meatballs-yes 
Honestly the fries were the highlight for me.
Tip-Monday sliders are $2"}
{"text":"So, I'm a big fan of Sienna Mercato downtown, and I've been wanting to try out this location for a long time, and it totally delivered!!! They have done a great job of replicating the atmosphere and ambiance of the downtown location, but also giving a unique experience in much different surroundings. I got Brussel sprouts, coleslaw and a chicken BBQ Meatball Grinder with bacon and Jalapeños, and Holy Moly it was all delicious! I personally like having the Parmesan on the side of the Brussels as I feel like they get a little too covered, but if you like a bunch of Parmesan you'll probably be fine leaving them the way they are. Anyways, the staff was awesome, the food was great, and I will definitely be back when I'm in the area!!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I had lunch here yesterday. It was my friend's second visit, my first. We got there right when they opened and were seated promptly at a great table on the outdoor patio overlooking Perry Highway. Our waitress Natalie was very nice and knowledgeable. She suggested various IPAs, our favorite. She also told us about their specials, and you could tell she loved the food as much as we were about to. We ordered the Poutine tots (you can get it with traditional fries but we thought we'd try something different). It was a great choice, as they were delicious, crispy, and ample. We then each got meatball sliders. Both the spicy pork and traditional meatball sliders were excellent. My friend isn't a vegetarian but she ordered the vegetarian meatball slider because she had it the last time and had raved about it. We were both very happy with our food, the service, and the atmosphere. This place was an exciting discovery. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love the build your own meatball and pasta dish. Sat at the bar and enjoyed a few great beers as well as meatballs.  Will be back."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner and drinks after having a drink and a less than stellar guest experience at a new house of a zillion beers down the road. Am I glad we did!  From the minute we walked in the door we felt welcomed. Host was friendly, we sat at the bar and the bar back gave us waters and menus. The manager welcomed us and suggested a new drink he  created with vodka, cucumber and Chambord which was refreshing. The bartender was fabulous, very attentive. The food was excellent. We had a bruschetta appetizer , chicken meatball grinder with pesto sauce and a beef meatball panini. The doors were open letting in the fresh air and sunshine, the Pirate game was on and the tunes were upbeat and fun. We will most definitely Be back! First night for the \"late night happy hour\" 9-11"}
{"text":"Two stars because it was edible.

But truthfully everything I ate here was subpar, to put it mildly...
The idea is there but the execution falls well below short. I had the chicken and the beef meatball slider with various sauces on the side so I could try AND IT ALL TASTED LIKE NOTHING!! BLAND BLAND BLAND!

Beyond that our server asks if we want their ranch/hot sauce (WTF) combo on the side to dip fries in. My boyfriend says sure and when our food comes out his side sauce is considerably bigger than mine. Of course when the check comes we find out why, $1.50 charge! I'm not mad about the price but why would you present that and NOT mention that it's an additional charge...annoying. 

No one at out table finished their food or took it home..."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved it!  A coworker and I went there for lunch.  The service was excellent & relatively quick for how busy they were.  What a great idea!!  The menu allows you to try a variety of flavors and everything was excellent.  I will be bringing my family back so we can all enjoy the excellence and variety that I enjoyed during lunch.  My daughter eats vegetarian & my son is more of hearty eater... the menu serves both.  Jamie, our server, was very friendly and explained the concept of the menu.  Cheers!!"}
{"text":"This three story restaurant downtown, Sienna Mercato, is just awesome !!! My boyfriend and I had already enjoyed Mezzo this summer (the nicer, more upscale restaurant on the middle level) and have wandered upstairs to the rooftop bar, Il Tetto, as well.  

The street level is home to Emporio- which is all things meatballs! DELICIOUS. I am a lover of meatballs, hold the spaghetti.... so I knew I would enjoy. We started with the buffalo fried chicken balls with bleu cheese -- unexpectedly we enjoyed them so much more than we thought we would!! We then got around to ordering- you can pair your meatballs with sides, put it on a sandwich, or just plain with sauce. We both opted for plain with different sauces and it was a hit!!! The beef was both of our favorites - and the crack sauce (in one word) is awesome!!! 

Go check this place out..."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! Awesome vibe, friendly staff, and the food was excellent. Our waitress was phenomenal, she walked us through the menu and gave us great recommendations. I never thought I could mix and match so many sides and sauces. The possibilities seemed endless. We will definitely be back. Emporio is one of those places you leave and know 100% you will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing. Would definitely return. Great food, great service despite going at a crowded lunch hour. My new favorite place and I definitely want to try the location in Wexford."}
{"text":"The venue is a bit confusing because it says Sienna Mercato on the outside. I had to check Google Maps to find out that Emporio was indeed on the inside. Better signage would help. The dining area is a bar-like scene, too noisy and dark for my taste but probably somewhat trendy to most folks.

The menu is pretty interesting. Basically, pick your meatballs, pick a sauce, and pick something on which to put the meatballs. I had french fry poutine with a spicy pork meatball on top. Menu prices seemed a tad upscale but may be fine for downtown Pittsburgh. However, I didn't think the food itself was all that remarkable once you get past the novelty.

Service was a bit spotty. They don't pay equal attention to every table, so when it was time to leave, it took us a while to get our checks."}
{"text":"Great service, fun foods and a knowledgeable waitsatff who gave great recommendations!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and atmosphere. Went there for dinner and drinks on a Wednesday night and it was fairly crowded. 

I had the meatball of the month which was a jalapeno cheddar with a queso cheese sauce and it was really good. Plenty of draft options to choose from as well. 

9 out of 10 would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Food was great!!!! I had the meatball of the month which was BBQ chicken on a hoagie. Sandwich was huge! Everyone else got bowls which looked small but I was told they were actually very filling. We got poutine also and it was excellent. My only complaint is that happy hour is either confusing or they didn't ring it in right and the space is crowded. A few less tables would do wonders for the space. I would also like if the condiments were brought to the table when needed because the caddy was big for such a small table. Almost not enough room for food and drinks and we were at a four top. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"The most amazing poutine place I've ever eaten at. Service was great. Huge beer selection.  You won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and it was awesome. The tator tot poutine was terrific. The gravy, hot tots, pork belly and melted curds were a freaking fabulous idea provided to us by our server, Rick. We are so glad we ordered it. We had a chicken crack spaetzle bowl and chicken parmesan tortellini bowl that were more than enough for lunch with just 2 balls!  
I would recommend stopping in for lunch or a happy hour 50 cent ball or $4 poutine special, we'll be back for that!"}
{"text":"Several trips here and Everytime I am impressed with the service that they perform.   On each occasion my server has been fantastic, friendly, and polite.  Additionally on Wednesdays kids can eat for half off, if that isn't enough they have someone come in to make balloon animals and paint faces.   Wait....you didn't check this review to just read about the great service, you wanted to know if a fancy meatball joint has good food.  I can attest that each item I have had here has been very good, and I have not been disappointed.   Additionally I now know the versatility of a meatball in dining options, something you probably never realized until you came to a meatball themed place.  Pairing with the plethera of meatball options is a pretty decent beer list that rotates keeping the choices fresh.   They even highlight the local beers, get there during happy hour and they are half off which really makes the beer meatball combination a nice change of pace from your usual casual dining fare."}
{"text":"Our waitress was WONDERFUL. I don't remember her name, but she was full of energy and was a sweetheart. I went there before with my work and just had to bring my boyfriend. I have recommended this location to everyone. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"My first stop in Pittsburgh! Went here based on a friends recommendation.  Came for lunch on a Friday and was not super busy.

I ordered the special meatball as a slider, the jambalaya meatball with meat ball sauce, the poutine tarts with mushroom gravy and of course a fried egg.  The meatball was nothing special to me and even though I love shrimp, I thought the shrimp flavor in it tasted off.  But the poutine tots made up for it! With the cheese curds and gravy it was so indulgent but so tasty. The tots were still crispy.  Don't think the egg added anything so I would skip that next time.

Think this spot is a great after drinks snack kind of place."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner on the way to a concert at the Benedum. The location is great, downtown in the Cultural District on Penn Ave. The restaurant is on the first floor of Sienna Mercado and has a nice open layout with a huge garage-door/window that opens right on to Penn Ave. When the weather is nice, it creates a perfect after-work/happy hour atmosphere. 

But enough about restaurant design, let's talk balls. Meatballs that is. They're the focus of the restaurant and they're delicious. I ordered the Thatsa-Spicy-Meat-a-Ball! Bowl which comes with two of their spicy pork balls, cheese tortellini arrabbiata, and jalapeños tossed in their spicy sauce. Do not underestimate the spice of this one. I love spicy food and these were absolutely fantastic, don't get me wrong, but the dish is fiery! The sauce and tortellini were great, but the meatballs were truly outstanding. They were full of flavor, have a great texture, and are very large! I cut each meatball into quarters to spread the love around my bowl and because there's no way you're eating these balls in less than four bites!

I was also able to try a few bites of the classic beef meatballs and they were also delicious. Emporio packs a lot of flavor and love into each meatball, and it shows!

The only thing I didn't love was the price. My bowl was $13 and came with two meatballs, which honestly would be fine if there was a little more pasta. You can double your meatballs for $4 but $17 is steep for a pasta and meatballs, especially in Pittsburgh. Overall, still worth it, I will definitely be back. Maybe during one of their many happy-hour specials which seemed fantastic! During the week from 4-6 all drinks are half off and buffalo chicken balls are 50 cents.

TLDR: Great atmosphere, incredible meatballs, go during the happy hour!"}
{"text":"Not super impressed... It's a cool concept but did not enjoy my meal there. It's always crazy busy, but after waiting for about an hour we were say in front of the pizza ovens and I felt like I was in a spin class, not a restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I met for dinner after work. Our server was so sweet. She was very knowledgeable of the menu. I asked her what she liked and she recommended the chicken balls with the crack sauce and the Brussel sprouts. That combination was delicious. Oh yeah and topped with crumbled bacon. The service was awesome and the food great, however, they should lighten up on the salt. I took the rest of my meal home because they give you a lot of food, which is a good thing. The next day is when I realized how salty is was. Great experience though."}
{"text":"This place is so good. And yes they serve exactly what they say. Meatballs. They are very good. You can get chicken, pork, beef and vegetarian. I'm pretty sure I will be obsessed with this place."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. The food is frickin amazing, and the draft root beer was really something special. :-)"}
{"text":"I have been here on several occasions for lunch.  The restaurant overlooks route 19 in Wexford and has a hipster look and feel to it.  They have some nice flat screen TVs that can be viewed from any seat and a good selection of beer on tap.  The side opens up allowing guests to sit outside overlooking route 19 which is nice for a beautiful summer day.  As the implies, they specialize in gourmet meatballs.

I've always ordered the meatball sliders when coming here.  You get to choose from an assortment of combinations of meatballs and sauces, including a special \"ball of the month\".  The portion sizes are a little small for the price, but it is a great way to eat a lighter lunch.  Their poutine fries are excellent and my favorite part of the meal here is dessert.  The ricotta donuts are just superb and they come with a side of warm fudge.  

If you're not looking for a huge meal, this is a great place to go! They have quality food with smaller portion sizes, and have some awesome dessert. I'll continue to come back here now that my Dad is hooked on this place."}
{"text":"Had a great experience last night before seeing Book of Mormon. It's become a staple before heading to a show in the Cultural District. I met a friend at the bar for dinner & drinks. I was there just a few minutes before Happy Hour ended and the bartender made sure to let me know AND get my drink order in time. 

I ordered the spicy pork meatballs with marinara. I've tried most of their meatballs and sauce combos and they are always delicious. The menu can look a little small at first, but the ease of creating a new and different combo instantly expands your selections. I would also recommend an order of tots, if you're into it. 

The bartender made this experience even better. She was friendly and engaging. She also placed an order for food for two other friends who were running late so they could eat and not be late to our show time."}
{"text":"I dined here for lunch this week with my dad and husband. This is the second location, and I've never been to the downtown one so I can't compare. 
Our server, introduced to us by the host as Mike, never showed up at our table. After flagging someone else down, we finally got service, so apparently they still have some kinks to work out here. Our new server was super friendly and apologetic. 
We each got the saucy balls - 4 meatballs in sauce in  bowl. I got the spicy pork with pesto, my husband the beef with pesto, and my dad the beef with pork bolognese. The meat itself was really good and you could tell there was very little filler. Our sauces were a bit odd though - the pesto was served cold on the side. The purpose for it being cold is beyond my comprehension - pesto is usually served warm. Even so, it was really tasty and the temperature didn't take away from my meal. 
I wouldn't recommend the bolognese unless you love nutmeg. The server warned my dad the sauce was a bit sweet because there was a hint of nutmeg in it, but he proceeded with it anyways. The nutmeg was entirely overpowering. I'd steer clear of this sauce. 
We ordered a side of veggie quinoa as well which was delicious. Our complaint with it though was that it was also served cold - again atypical for the kind of dish. The intention is to put your meatballs in sauce over top of the side, but that would have ruined the quinoa so don't do that if you order it. Is the chill on the dish indicative of laziness and that it is not made fresh daily? I sure hope not but it leads one to question it. 
I'd also love to see them offer some additional choices for meat. They do have a meatball of the month, which perhaps is their way of testing out what does well, but at a minimum I would think chicken and lamb would be no brainers to add. Bison or some sort of seafood would also be delicious.
Prices were good, service friendly and fast and food was overall really good aside from some quirks. I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"My coworker's birthday is tomorrow, so we decided to head over to Emporio for a group lunch. I have dined at the downtown location many times and was excited to try out this spot.

We didn't need to call / NoWait ahead of time for a group of 5 people for lunch. The restaurant was over half full but not completely packed. We were seated immediately, and after deliberating over all of the tasty-sounding menu options, selected our food. The waitress was courteous and prompt, and our food did not take long to arrive after we ordered. The entire experience - from selecting our food to the fries appetizer and our sandwiches and even a chocolaty doughnut dessert - took a little over an hour. Not long to wait, in my opinion!

The food was all very tasty. The herb & parmesan fries were warm and crispy. My two sliders - the Classic Beef w/ Mushroom Gravy and the Turkey w/ Spinach-Almond Pesto - were very good. I couldn't stop raving over the Mushroom Gravy. The thick but smooth, hearty, and flavorful sauce was outstanding. Generally, I order the Creamy Parmesan and the Tzatziki but was so happy that I stepped out of my comfort zone. I think the Mushroom Gravy and Creamy Parmesan are officially my two favorites now! Finally, we ended the meal with the warm and somehow both soft and crunchy Ricotta Doughnuts. Order these with the chocolate sauce on the side - yum yum yum! You know a sauce is good when you don't mind the fact that you dribbled it on your hand and pants.

My expectations were completely met for my lunch today from food and service to cleanliness and wait time. This will definitely be one of my go-to restaurants when I'm in the Cranberry/Wexford area, and I look forward to returning in the future."}
{"text":"It would be a lie if I told you I wasn't jealous of the brilliant mind that came up with a restaurant based on jazzed-up meatballs. Although I don't think you could eat here more than twice a month without clogging your arteries completely, it's one of the tastiest meals in Pittsburgh to enjoy once in a while.

My most recent visit to Emporio was my second so far, and both times it has been incredible. Deciding what to eat is always hard here because EVERYTHING looks like it would taste wonderful. There are pork, chicken, and beef meatballs, but what really makes this place a winner are vegan and vegetarian options! Who would have guessed a meatball place has a meatless meatball? Emporio's is made of mushrooms, white beans, and cauliflower and they do have a few vegan or veg sauces and sides as well. These are on my \"must try\" list.

The first time I was here was during November of 2016, and at the time they were featuring their Thanksgiving meatballs with mashed potatoes, gravy, stuffing, etc. To a person that loves Thanksgiving food it was heavenly. Last week, I ordered the \"Angry Birds\" which are 2 chicken meatballs (massive meatballs, might I add), mac & cheese with the government cheese, \"crack sauce,\" and blue cheese crumbles to top it all off. My boyfriend got the featured meatloaf meatballs and got them \"Loaded Baked Potato\" style with potatoes, tater tots, bacon bits, and lots of delicious toppings.

The singular complaint that I had about my meal was the saltiness, but when I took my leftovers home and ate them with BBQ sauce on top the next day they were phenomenal. If I could add anything at all to the menu to make this place better, it'd be some Sweet Baby Ray's. You can swap sides like pasta or potatoes for green beans or Brussels sprouts, but it's rather difficult to turn away their mac & cheese.

Overall, Emporio has a unique but simple concept, the dining area was neat and well-kept, and the staff was incredibly friendly. I'll certainly be back once I feel I've worked off my last Emporio meal, and I'll be happily awaiting trying something new from the menu until then!"}
{"text":"I've been a returning customer at Emporio for years and now I have to say no more. The first time was awesome! Good food. Good drinks. Good service. The second time our waitress was so eager to turn over our table that she was rude, pushy and made us feel rushed. The third time our server had no knowledge of the menu, forgot to apply the advertised discount to our bill, rushed us on ordering and laughed when one of our party pronounced a wine wrong. Oh and something else kind of important, we got food poisoning from the meatballs. Apparently after asking around I found this is common with them these days. And when I called management to leave a message (figuring they'd want to know so they could fix their food) I got and answering machine and no one followed up on my message. Been burned too many times. Food is delicious but not worth all the bad."}
{"text":"Love love love. I'm super picky about ground meat but they prepared everything perfectly! And they must use top quality ingredients. We started with some poutine with mushroom gravy, which was the perfect sauce choice; it's so savory and rich. Great start. We went with sliders so we could try 3 different types of meatball in a 'sandwich' format. Beef with arrabiatta, spicy pork with government cheese, and the meatball of the day, pizza (I think it was pork with cheese) with pizza sauce. All were just amazing! 

The ambiance was pretty cool, our bartender was on top of things, and they had a superb beer list."}
{"text":"Good balls!  I got the Thatsa-Spicy-Meat-A-Ball bowl and we got the Buffalo Shrimp and Crab Dip as an appetizer.  Both were good but I actually think the dip was better than the bowl.  A little pricey."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a rather more or less pleasant experience. We walked in and were seated right away. The place had a real casual atmosphere with large doors open to the outside. We got our menus right away and the server took the time to explain how the menu worked, since it was fairly different than your average dining experince in the sense that you  could customize your meatball sub with sauces and addtions. We went on Monday hoping to get a slightly less ecpensive meal. (2 dollar sliders with the sliders being rather sizeable for sliders) the meatball of the month was a bbq chicken meatball that came recommended by our server.  We both got that and it was the favorite for both of us out of what we ordered. The meal and service was very good overall. However this experience only gets a 4 star because we were neglected to be told of the upcharges adding bacon to the sliders... yes normally bacon or any add on s is an upcharge and thats fine.. sliders cost was 2 dollars... bacon crumbles (not loaded on, just added for some flavor) was 2 dollars. I wasnt thinking the few crumbles of bacon would be the cost of the sandwhich itself. I cant say this was a bad experience by any means but the value for what we got was just okay. I wanted to try it without spending a lot of money but ended up paying double what I baraged for. Id go back but probably skip the added bacon. If you are getting the sliders dont bother with the added extras, its not worth the value."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre in my opinion and not worth the price. My bowl literally was just your typical spaghetti and meatballs that I could have made at home, but was more costly. On top of that, the waitress was a little bit moody, and didn't really help me clarify questions about the menu (kept asking if I wanted to get things with my order without specifying that they weren't free)."}
{"text":"I hate this place! The whole concept is awful. The menu is confusing and the waitress did not explain it to us so it took us forever to order. The food is just ok. If you have no choice and have money to burn thru, then go to see what I mean. If you have even just one other choice than take that one. I'm sure you will be better off. Another note is the staff working, they were not welcoming at all. They walked around staring at us and just seemed off and didn't know what they were doing. They had no smiles and were not friendly at all."}
{"text":"Great new place in Wexford - spinning off from original on Penn Avenue. Very busy on the first Saturday night of business but Open Table app made our 45 min wait not so bad. Actually, we may have been seated in more like 35 min but on to the food.
Menu format takes a minute to follow if you are new to this meatball concept. We needed a little help from server and cool folks around us- portion/sizes are hard to determine from menu descriptions but not a thing disappointed! Great flavor combos, textures and offerings on menu. 
Great bar choices too - full draft list.
Cool decorations and vibe in place. The only thing I didn't like were the chairs - red metal and not so comfy but still okay. 
Very loud as well but that won't keep me away. Bring on the meatballs baby!!!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure to visit this fine establishment yesterday and wanted to say that the beer selection was great! Many seasonal micro-brews to select from and the staff were very friendly. Also the Happy-Hour was a great deal with half/off wines/beers!!!  I also tried the Buffalo Chicken Balls and they were out of this world!!  The sauce they were made in was spicy and right to the point!  Very Impressed and will be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this place since the first one downtown opened up years ago. It's a great location and a great place close to home with a lot of TVs a ton of different beers on tap and great food. I agree with most of these other reviews and think the chicken meatball is great. I also am a huge fan of the mac and cheese and government cheese and my sister loves the poutine. The ball of the month is usually also very good."}
{"text":"Oh Emporio I have such mixed feelings about you every time we visit. I adore the idea but the execution is so hot or cold.
We  visited the cranberry location on a Saturday night. Make sure you use the no wait app because the wait is quite substantial. There were 4 in our group, and even with the no wait app we waited for an hour and a half. I really don't like that you have to be within 10 miles to get in line. We live 15 miles away and we could have waited longer before leaving the house if they would increase the distance. Frustrating. Not to mention, you get the notification that your table is ready on your phone, you go to the hostess station, and then you spend another 10 minutes waiting to be seated. So strange. 
Service was passable, neither friendly nor outright horrible. We waited 50+ minutes and everything we ordered (appetizers, salads, and entrees) was delivered at once. This truly annoys me to no end. We could have easily had at least our salads before our entrees instead of waiting almost another hour before receiving anything at all to eat! Not to mention your food sits there, getting cold, because it was all delivered at once. Argh!
The meatballs were, as always, good, with the exception of the buffalo chicken balls. The first time we had them as an appetizer downtown I loved them, but this past time they were more like q spicy BBQ sauce as opposed to a buffalo sauce. 
All in all we will probably go back, but just make sure to ask that they properly course your food if you are ordering different courses!"}
{"text":"Really nothing special.  The meatballs are just okay.  So for a meatball joint you'd expect more.  The options of pairing different types of meatballs with different sauces is a nice idea but none of the sauces are really that special either.  Despite this we go often as the atmosphere is nice and the beer selection is fine. Appreciate they came North as we need more non chain restaurants in the area, but just feel they could tweak things a bit still.  Also they got rid of the aioli that went with the fries.  Was probably one of my favorite items on the menu."}
{"text":"yummy! Great fun atmosphere! I love how you can order small size meatballs and pick which sauce on each one. These are NOT your average size meatballs!! Get the tomato risotto! Great service as well!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing. \"crack sauce \" is my all time favorite. Staff is friendly... bathrooms are clean.  
Great beer selection. Will most definitely return."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here server is very nice and knows her stuff the kids meal is a good size he gets to take food home and it comes with a kids meal. The food looks and taste great. Love the bottle the water come in. Just wish the menu came better instructor but it was great our server new it."}
{"text":"Saw this place on ginormous foods. This place is awesome. I travel to Pitt for work about once a month, and will defiantly come back. I had the 4 meatball mea!, with spaghetti and meat sauce. Great place!!"}
{"text":"This is my third or fourth stop at the new site in wexford and I have not been disappointed yet.  Yes, the menu is a little limited,  but it says MEATBALL JOINT in large letters on the window.  That is what they do and they do it well.  

You pick a meatball a sauce and a side...heaven.  today I had the meatball of the month (jambalaya ) and my usual beef with arribatta sauce.  You are making a huge mistake if you do not get the parmesean fries appetizer.  Beer, fries, and meatballs...WIN"}
{"text":"I'll tell you this... Emporio has become one of those places we like to take friends who are visiting PITTSBURGH from out of town. Located in the heart of downtown, I love this restaurant! The inside decor is great - very urban/industrial feel with garage doors that open in nice weather. Service has always been great! Plenty of seating, and a text-to-let-you-know-when-your-table-is-ready-system if there's a wait. 

Food. I like the food at Emporio. I like to get the Saucy Balls (yes, kids can come to this restaurant). I order 4 different meatballs - usually the beef, pork, chicken, and the special of the month. I like to get the crack sauce and a side of Mac and cheese with the government cheese. My wife likes to get the meatball panini with chicken meatballs, smoked gouda (it is sooo \"gouda\"), and a side of crispy parm Brussels sprouts (honestly, these sprouts are killer good). AND if you're particularly hungry...you should get a side of Parmesan-herb French fries as you wait. It's massive and delicious. 

Want a unique experience of enjoying some meatballs whilst being immersed in the best city? Who wouldn't? Emporio is where you need to drop your..."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing.  The staff including our waiter, Keaton and his manager, JP were so helpful in recommending drinks, dinner and dessert. We felt very welcome and we're able to stay a long time to catch up with old friends.  I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Our group of twelve came here to celebrate two birthdays on a Friday night. Typically they don't take reservations, but they made an exception for us since we had such a large party. We were extremely thankful for such great service. We were sat promptly at our reservation time, and they were pretty busy so it took a while for us to get our drinks. We ordered pretty quickly, and the food came out fast. Everyone really enjoyed their meals. I got a beef meatball slider with the tomato basil sauce (highly recommend this sauce) and a wedge salad. The salad wasn't bad, but it was VERY difficult to cut in the bowl they served it in. I'd much rather have preferred it on a plate. It was almost more work than it was worth. Either way, everyone seemed very pleased with their food and I've never been disappointed in my previous visits. Their draft list is extensive and varied, and they make sure to point out the local beers on tap. They brought out little cake balls with some cream cheese \"sauce\" on it with a candle in it for each of the birthday girls. It is definitely a fun atmosphere with a unique food theme."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place before seeing John Cleese at Heinz Hall.  Knew it was close by and should be quick.

Well, yes, it was close by and yes it was quick enough and our server was attentive. And the menu options seemed plenty.

But, the food?  Nothing to write home about.  I ordered 3 meatballs -- beef with red sauce, pork with sausage gravy, and chicken with pesto.  All sounded like winning combos but, in reality?  Lukewarm, rather dry meatballs, with very tepid sauces.  And flavors?  Pretty darned bland.

Would I go again?  Hmmm... I will say their brussel sprouts saved the day -- plenty and crispy so, maybe, just maybe."}
{"text":"I wish there were half stars because I'd give this place a 4.5. Meatballs are my jam so this place called my name. I ordered two beef meatballs with the Parmesan penne and meat sauce. And yes I housed it. Not a scrap left. The meatballs were the right consistency and had really good flavor. Not quite the best meatballs I've had (that goes to Prato in Winter Park, Fla.) but close. Great atmosphere, too. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"So good...we stopped for lunch on a Saturday, it was not busy. We were greeted promptly by the host as well as our server. We each had a beer and then started out with the poutine as an appetizer. We chose the tater tots with creamy Parmesan and garlic cheese sauce. They were a perfect start. I ordered the turkey meatballs with government cheese over penne pasta. My husband had the spicy pork meatballs with bolognese over mashed potatoes. Both were exceptional. The pork bolognese had a sweet taste, almost pumpkin like, but that didn't take away from the taste. We love this place..."}
{"text":"Eh, I thought the meatballs here were ok, they weren't that delicious nor was the sauce. The chicken meatball w/ parmesan cream was probably the best, but overall, the food here was good but not great."}
{"text":"I think most restaurants try to be fun,  it Emporio really nails it. This place is great! The menu is good for individuals or large groups. You can customize your meal in so many different ways! The pork meatballs are absolutely amazing, the chicken meatballs will make you cry because YUM. And then the sauces, there are so many sauces! It's ridiculous. And they have poutine! 

The wait staff is attentive but they don't bug you like some places do. It makes it easy to have a conversation and just enjoy your amazingly delicious meatball extravaganza."}
{"text":"All I can say yum this place is awesome. I am stuffed I need a pillow and bed asap. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they were. I order the chicken meatball with spicey red sauce and the Parmesan fries. The meatball were cool prefect nice a juicy. I have to come back here I am from Chicago and I am thinking how I am gone get back here for more."}
{"text":"Beautiful night, sat on the patio.  Food was delicious, portions were plenty.  Tyler was our waiter, very knowledgeable and attentive.  A great night out."}
{"text":"Eh ok I guess. Have only been there once and almost walked out because we didn't get service after sitting there for like 20 min. The manager noticed and offered us an apology and a free appetizer. That was nice but still left a bad taste in my mouth. 
Anyway... Dining on just meatballs didn't do it for me. Kinda weird and didn't do anything for me. Sorry..."}
{"text":"My first visit will probably be my last. Food was decent but I had gristle & a piece of bone in my meatball. Portions are good and the meatballs did not taste like sawdust as so many restaurant meatballs do. Waitstaff was excellent."}
{"text":"Worth the drive from Florida! The beef and spicy sausage meatballs were amazing right along with our gnocchi and spicy marinara sauce! Finished off with red velvet cake balls- don't skip dessert!"}
{"text":"My second favorite type of ball may have surpassed its competitors to claim the #1 slot. Every time I've come I have tried a new type of meatball/sauce combination, and have yet to be disappointed. You could water board me with the chicken gravy and I would die happy. On another note though, as someone who's overly French Canadian I'm more partial towards traditional style poutine while Emporio's is a fancier take on the greasy side dish--however they do give you the option to pick between different gravy's which I have yet to see in other restaurants."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go to this place because they have vegetarian meatballs. The menu said they were made from mushroom, white bean, and cauliflower. I really like all of those vegetables & the meatballs tasted like none of them. I was expecting some texture but they were just blobs of paste. They tasted like masala spices, which is just plain odd seeing that the sauce choices would NEVER pair with those flavors. I ordered garlic parmesan sauce, thinking they'd be seasoned with some simpler herbs. The fries, however, were the absolute best fries I've ever had! They were crispy, light, & covered in parmesan all of the way through, not just on the top layer. I might come back just to try more of their side dishes, but I really hope they change the recipe of the veggie meatballs."}
{"text":"This place was nothing like I expected. It was almost like a Subway of meatballs and pasta and sauce. Not a great selection, and the things we got were very average. Like jarred Ragu quality sauce. The staff was nice, and prompt, and the environment was pleasant, but I doubt I'll ever eat here again."}
{"text":"This place had delicious meatballs and appetizers but was way over priced for meatballs. Have been back twice and felt the same way each time."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Emporio!  Their menu is simple, inexpensive, and DELICIOUS.  I always enjoy their \"ball of the month\" rotation, and they have a great selection of drinks that rotates often as well."}
{"text":"First place I visited while in Pittsburgh to eat and I was MORE than impressed. This place is the bomb.com! I wish we had a place like this at home. Our server was awesome! He was very helpful in picking out good food for us! We split the Buffalo meatball things. AMAZING! I swear they melted in my mouth. I got the that's a spicy meatball dish. It was honestly one of the best meals I had while in Pittsburgh. It was so good. It was full of flavor and had some kick to it. My husband loved his meal as well. My kids even ate everything! Would highly recommend while here!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid little spot. I love how you can chose your meatball type, sauces, and \"vehicle\" (spaghetti, hoagie, sliders etc). Each combo I've had has been pretty tasty. Service is always great! Good beer selection, too. It's a plus that they're on No Wait so you can check the length of the wait before heading out (and you can put yourself in line without having to physically be at the restaurant). Great casual little spot!!"}
{"text":"Very good little joint! Quality meatballs & ingredients. The Mac n cheese with creamy Parmesan is delicious. A little pricey, but excellent service."}
{"text":"I've never had balls so tasty!!! Go on Monday as it's Meatball Monday and the single ones are $2. It allows you to try as many flavors as possible. I loved the Chicken and basil sauce. Second favorite would be the chicken with the Parmesan sauce. The Brussels sprouts as a side was a great paring. Love. Love. LOVE this place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite dinner spots in the city. 

Yes - it's a meatball joint.  But don't let the simplicity of what they serve overshadow the genius of what you experience. 

This menu is fully customizable. Satisfy each and every one of your taste buds as you create the meatball masterpiece of your dreams. 

A creation for every craving. I'm a huge fan of the \"saucy balls\" entree. It comes with four huge meatballs, but you reduce it to two meat balls for a reduced fee. Enjoy it with a red sauce over pasta for a more traditional Italian fare, or pair it up with Crack Sauce over Tater tots for a more \"pub-friendly\" option. 

Do yourself a favor and order a side of the Brussel sprouts. It might not be the healthiest Brussel sprout rendition, but it is certainly the tastiest. 

Food allergy/preference friendly."}
{"text":"The food here was edible. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. The meatballs were dry and the mac and cheese was used tiny little pasta. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"We've been here, and to their sister location in the North Hills, 3 or 4 times now. Pretty limited menu at first look, but lots more than you might expect. Fun place to enjoy an interesting lunch. Meatballs!"}
{"text":"I love meatballs! I had to stop by and check out this place while in town. The hostess was welcoming and our waitress explained the menu to us when we told her it was our first time. She brought out two glass water bottles and filled our glasses with water from one and then left the full one at our table. I thought that was a nice touch! We started out with the cheese bread which was served with marinara sauce. They also offer poutine here. It's something I've always wanted to try and was told theirs looked legit. It was so good! We also ordered the saucy balls which includes 4 meatballs of your choice or mix for +$1. Our choices were beef, pork, chicken, and the ball of the month being taco flavor. We opted for the arrabbiata sauce for a spicy kick. While they were all tasty in their own way, the pork was definitely the winner. Service, food, and ambiance were all great!"}
{"text":"MEAT & ALCOHOL!

This review could attract a few people with nothing else being said, but I'll write a little more.  Emporio in Wexford is a hip little place that spun away from its big brother in the city.  The place isn't going to wow you with decor and the service is pretty good, but meatballs, cocktails, and craft beer will fill your cravings.
I typically go with the meatball sliders and the nice thing is you can customize your meat/sauce to try a few different combos.  I grab a cool beer and some tots and I have myself a heck of a meal.  
Bonus points for my three year old daughter digging it as well."}
{"text":"Meatballs. What more can you ask for! Great variety and lots of menu choices. If you haven't been to Emporio yet, I would highly recommend it! Start your meal off with either the poutine or the buffalo balls. Then, I would suggest getting the saucy balls over government mac and cheese, if you are feeling pretty hungry. If you aren't hungry, you can't go wrong with the sliders or a panini. I really like how they recently added various bowl options as well; they all look delicious! I have yet to try any of the dessert that they have, but I am looking to go back soon to give the dessert a try! I have to make a mental note to make sure to save some room!

Overall, it's a great atmosphere with even better food.  After you finish your meal, make your way over to the elevator to go up to the top floor and have yourself a drink on the rooftop bar!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place, but it seems like the talent has passed in the kitchen.  I thought the food was simple enough to not screw up, but I was wrong.  Fries tasted like they had sat under a lamp for two days. The veg and regular meatballs were extremely salty. A big turn off. They got rid of the tzatziki sauce, which was my favorite.  They changed the pesto sauce into some weird creamy substance that looks like pureed guacamole, but more watery.  The only good thing was that the service was up to speed.  I would only go here if I needed to meet for beer or something now. Another major flaw on their \"wedge\" salad...They serve it in a small metal bowl.  It is impossible to eat since it needs to be cut up.  I literally sat there looking at it wondering how I was supposed to get it in my mouth.  I tried cutting it and the bowl would roll around and spill all over the table.  Straight knives do not cut easily on curved surfaces.  I wanted to bring the chef out and have him try to eat it in front of me.  I am all done with this place, maybe Mezzo still decent?"}
{"text":"Just a few visits.  A bit odd to have \"meatballs\" as a speciatly.  But worth the visit when there at the cinemark.  Friendly, easy access, great parking."}
{"text":"Outstanding! I didn't get to explore the middle restaurant but the whole concept of this place is great. I went with three other people and we fit comfortably in a booth. We ordered the poutine with pork belly and it was amazing. It was such a great combination of flavors. We each ordered a meatball entree and considering it comes with pasta and the meatballs are large, it was a large portion and filling. My friend and I also had a pre-appetizer appetizer though, so maybe you'll need a little more yourself. The meatball options are all unique and interesting. If I could've, I would've tried more than one option, but it's just another reason to go back. I tried the standard Fuggeta Bowl It bowl and even though it's what you'd expect when you think of meatballs, it didn't make it any less delicious. After the meal, we went up to the rooftop bar and enjoyed an old fashioned. This was one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Have been to this location before, not sure what happened to my previous review (go figure that Yelp changed or lost it), but so many call this Sienna Mercato or Sienna pgh due to the website; anyway it is one of the three restaurants in the Sienna Mercato building.  1. Emporio the Meatball Joint, 2. Mezzo (a pizza and charcuterie- wood-fired pizza-pasta- panini place) and 3. Il tetto (a beer garden) on the floor with an roof that open in good weather. Had the spicy pork meatballs which were good but nothing to write home about.  The do have a few options on the meatball choices including a vegetarian meatball...go figure.  We eat and were seated at the bar and the bartender was friendly and good."}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for balls a place like Emporio is the place to be. They've somehow made chicken meatballs taste better than a standard meatball. I assume it's some kind of black magic or space age seasoning. Oddly enough, the typical meatball and marinara combo is the least satisfying. Their other options and specialty balls are pretty much delicious. They had a cheese and habanero ball a while back as a special and it was top shelf. We had great service and they do have a nice beer list."}
{"text":"Amaze-balls! That's how I would describe this experience. Amazing + meatballs = Emporio. This was my first time at this location specifically but certainly not my first time at the chain. I can say with confidence that the food here was slightly tastier than the Downtown location. 

I ordered what I order every time I visit: parmesan-herb fries, chicken slider w/ creamy parmesan sauce and beef slider w/ meat sauce. The buns in the sliders were soft, warm and buttery. And the fries were hot and crispy. 

Service was awesome. Waitress even saved us $5 by informing us of the spend $25 on a gift card and get $5 special being offered. Can't wait to give back here. Excellent experience."}
{"text":"It was ok.  Nothing bad, but nothing great, and definitely not worth the money.  The meatballs are good, but they're just meatballs.  Nothing special.  The fries are very good.  Macaroni and cheese had a good flavor, but very pastey in texture.  Service was good, and a nice selection of beer.  I'm glad I tried it, but I doubt that I'll be back."}
{"text":"Brooke was our host and waitress. She is very well educated on the menu and really passionate about the food. She gave us great suggestions on what to order. I had the 3 sliders one chicken, one pork, and one beef with 3 different sauces.  All were wonderful. Please continue to keep passionate foodies on your staff! She made the experience wonderful."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Each of us had something different so we had a chance to sample different items. For a specialty menu it was a good choice for dinner. Good size portions so I have lunch tomorrow. Service was also very good"}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to visit Emporio after visiting the handmade arcade this weekend.  Our timing was utter perfection before the rush of shoppers and cheerleaders arrived!

The ball of the month - the dragon ball - was so very good.  We were able to get \"saucy balls\" with 2 dragon balls and 2 other balls of our choice.  It was scrumptious!

Our waitress was on top of our service - refilled our drinks promptly, delivered food, took plates, etc.  Everything was great and quick and easy.

The reason for the 4 and not 5 stars.  We each had separate checks  (3 of us) 2 paid with credit cards, I paid with cash.  When my change was brought (my bill was $21.50 and I paid $30) - our waitress rounded my total up to $22 - and brought me $8 back.  While it is likely that I would leave a tip including that 50 cents - I did not appreciate the assumption.  What if I had chosen to not leave a tip due to horrendous service?  (although I don't foresee myself ever doing that! and we didn't have horrendous service)  You never assume what your tip is going to be.  I still left a decent tip - but I was disappointed by that assumption. 

Otherwise the food was great and the service was great."}
{"text":"We ate a little bit of everything from the menu. The fried pickles were decent; and, the poutine was delicious; however, the bruschetta was below average. The salads were fresh but over dressed and over seasoned - something we found with other dishes, including the pesto-drenched ditalini and the extremely peppery mac and cheese (for my son). The classic beef meatball was pretty good but the chicken meatball stole the show. The creamy parmesan and marinara were fairly standard sauces but the tzatziki and spinach-almond pesto were fantastic. Some of us had slides, others had paninis, and the rest had saucy balls over sides. Overall, the food is mostly a novelty; however, it is still tasty and worth a try.

A few side notes: For a large party that included a small child, I very much appreciated that food comes out almost immediately after you order. Also, the outdoor patio, which is closed in during the winter, is not a great place to sit in cold weather. Granted, the heat was broken while we were there, it was a chilly and rather uncomfortable seating area with cold metal chairs and an even colder concrete floor.

I'm not sure I would go out of my way to visit again - but I would certainly consider it for another family meal if we're in the area."}
{"text":"My friend was visiting from out of town and suggested this place as he had heard good things. So have I so I was excited to check it out finally!

Our server was freaking awesome. She was so personable and funny, we even took a photo together at the end of the night. She answered all of our questions and was just the right level of attentive. 

I got the vegetarian balls and wow they were so good! I'm glad they have options because two balls was filling! The buffalo chicken appetizer balls were AMAZING. 

Of course at the moment I forget what the special IPA they had was but it was so delicious, I think I took a photo of it haha! 

This place was packed when we were there on a weeknight evening but it didn't feel overcrowded at all. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We are staying nearby and decided to try this place. It had more gluten free options than many restaurants in the area. The meatballs were pretty good"}
{"text":"Solid. We were greeted and seated promptly by the hostess. Our waiter was terrific! He was on it. I chose the chicken balls with pasta and had their pesto almond sauce. Yum! The pasta may have been a little overdone for my taste but the balls were great,  good seasoning. I also got a side of tots which were okay. They were not too greasy which was nice but they were just tots. I would get fries should I go back. The hubby got their hoagie with chicken balls and pesto and enjoyed it. My bestie chose the veggie balls panini and fries and loved it. Her hubby got the spicy pork balls hoagie and enjoyed it as well. Overall solid and I would go back."}
{"text":"In the past 2 1/2 years since my first review, I've continued going to Emporio. The food is still incredible, and the service has greatly improved! This remains one of my favorite restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This was a really fun place with really delicious food.  The meatballs are full of flavor, and I like that you have options of their suggestions, or a build your own kind of meal.  Its cool because you can mix and match and choose different sauces as well.  I was with a pretty decent sized group, and we all got different items.  Everyone loved their food.  I basically built my own meatball bowl with mac and cheese, a chicken ball, the classic ball, and the special which was a cheeseburger ball that day.   I also got crack sauce, government cheese, and basil pesto cream. Totally worth it!  Our server helped me make my choices, and I was extremely pleased.
Flavors were on point, portions pretty big, and the prices are not bad either.

 I would suggest mixing and matching so you can try various items.  There are so many great choices! A do not miss if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This place is not what I expected. I thought it would be an Italian themed restaurant.  Instead it was more like a brew pub.  I was there at happy hour and there were mostly guys at the bar.  

We ordered the fried brussels as an appetizer. They were very good. Actually, some of the best I've had. For the main course I ordered the forget a bowl it. It's basically penne with meat sauce topped with two meatballs and shaved parmesan. 

All in all it was good, not amazing, but good."}
{"text":"I had never noticed this place before stopping in for a quick lunch yesterday afternoon. What a pleasant surprise! Excellent, attentive and friendly service. I had the beef meatballs panini with the pesto cream sauce. Meatballs were good, not life changing but good. The sauce, however? Delicious. I'd go back for that sauce alone. Also had a side of the Brussels sprouts, which were a little heavy on the Parmesan cheese but otherwise very good. All in all, glad I stopped in and will definitely return."}
{"text":"I work downtown and this is one of the main staples for lunch. Nice, big place with usually no wait (which is a big deal during lunch) especially if you get there at or before noon. 

The paninis or bowls are perfect for a medium to large lunch, and I've never gotten a bad combination there. Spicy pork with the crack sauce is my go-to, and the sauce lives up to its name. It's a good punch of flavor that keeps me ordering it again and again.

The sides are every bit as good, with deliciously crisp and tender tater tots if you're feeling like grease, but I can't recommend the brussels sprouts enough. Sprouts have become a big deal in recent years and Emporio's are crispy, with the right amount of char and the parmesan gives it just the right amount of saltiness.  

Each month there's a specialty ball that I'll get more often than not, and it's usually okay at worst and delicious as best. If you're downtown it's a good one to add into the rotation."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are always good, my husband loves crack sauce!! We put it on the fries too and it was good. The wedding soup was not. To many greens, giant chunks of tough chicken and warm to cold broth. I like their rocket salad though, chunks of mozzarella make it. Definetly fair prices, and happy hour is pretty good here."}
{"text":"We really enjoy going here! We were seated immediately and never had to wait for drinks or to order. The wait staff was very attentive and friendly. The food is pretty good, very filling. The arrabbiata sauce is the best. Our food didn't take long at all and we went on a Saturday evening. The atmosphere is very laid back and casual. Overall we were really satisfied with our dining experience and happy to see the manager checking on all the guests."}
{"text":"I loved the concept of this restaurant: meatballs.
I love meatballs and they sure have a variety of different meats and sauces. 
I honestly didn't think the meatballs were the most tasteful  around; however, they weren't bad.
The sizes were massive! So Definately worth the money."}
{"text":"This place was great! Love the way you can customize your meal. I got the spicy pork meatballs with the meat sauce and cheese tortellini. The buffalo shrimp crab dip didn't taste like shrimp or crab, just cold buffalo sauce and cream cheese (which isn't bad, just unexpected). But the donut balls for dessert were warm and delicious."}
{"text":"Been here many times and it continues to be so so good. Wait staff is great though this past trip I asked a question about fillers and our waitress didn't know. Only going with 4 stars bc I cannot find nutrition info anywhere -and I feel like I'm a pretty good \"googler\" haha. To be fair though I've never asked at the restaurant, but I thought it'd be on their site. If you like Brussels sprouts, these are hands down the best ones I've EVER had. They are worth the drive alone!!"}
{"text":"Super excited when I heard they finally opened.  One trouble we had was my hubby made a \"reservation\" using the no wait app last saturday.  There was a 2 hr wait accdg to it.  When we got here, the hostess checked us in, but when another hostess looked at her tablet, she said she couldn't find our name anymore (lost our place in line). The hostess tried to fix it, and we waited an extra 25 mins. 

My husband got an old fashioned, which he enjoyed because he said it was made almost to perfection.

For entrees, we each got the 4 saucy meatballs with our choice of gravy and sides.  I got the ball of the month which was the thanksgiving/turkey stuffing meatball over creamy parm mac and cheese and mushroom gravy.  This particular meatball flavor is genius!  It had the perfect consistency and taste.  The sweetness and tartness of the cranberry went well with the gravy.  I hope they just make this a regular on the menu. 

The creamy mac & cheese was bland.  I should've gone with the government cheese.  Actually, I think it would go better with the mashed potatoes, which was the highlight if my mom's entree.  It had the perfect seasoning and texture.

My mom had 4 grandma's meatball with mushroom gravy and the mashed potatoes on the side.  Grandma's meatballs were ok. Good flavor and moist but nothing special.  Again, get the mashed pots!  

My husband got the spicy pork meatballs w/pork bolognese sauce over tater tots. Unlikely combo, but hey it probably tasted good bc he seemed to enjoy his dish.  I think we could've each gotten 3 meatballs instead of 4 because each of us had one leftover meatball.  The meatballs were a little bigger than a golf ball.

For dessert, we had the pecan balls.  It was 3 balls of vanilla ice cream rolled in pecans and served over hot fudge.  Yes it was over; not the other way around, which was fine bc I love chocolate.  The pecan balls and doughnuts were highly recommended for dessert.

The bar area was crowded, and I didn't sit on the bar stools, but they looked uncomfortable.  Our server, Tyler, was friendly, made some recommendations, and was attentive.  Overall, I would recommend it if you like meatballs.  Hopefully, they can do something about the no wait app."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience at Emporio! While we waited for dinner, we had a drink at the bar. Bartenders were very friendly and attentive, and make a really good drink. There was a pretty decent selection of beers on tap, which I enjoyed seeing. We split the buffalo chicken meatball appetizer at dinner. It was definitely my favorite part! The addition of the thinly shredded celery and blue cheese on top the meatballs calmed down the spice, and it added great texture. The meatball itself was pretty good, I just thought it was a little too cooked on the outside for my taste. For dinner, I made my own slider with a chicken meatball and mushroom gravy. I wish I would've gotten more because it was a great combo! The chicken meatball was very tender, and I enjoyed the gravy. However, it could've used a little more spice. I also got an order of the Parmesan-herb fries. If I would've known how big the order was, I would've shared it! It was enough for two people! But they were cooked very well and seasoned well; I enjoyed the sharpness of the Parmesan. All in all, my friends and I enjoyed our meal here and will return back in the future! A nice addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Meatball meatball, spaghetti underneath! I don't know many other meatball centric restaurants so I guess that means Emporio is my favorite. No matter how you style them - over sauce, in a panini, or as a slider - they're the perfect comfort food. The best thing about them is that you can easily customize the meatballs and poutine to your heart's content. I am in love with the veggie meatballs, however, sometimes they're a little heavy handed on the salt. Either way, they can't be beat. For vegetarians, the poutine with mushroom gravy is a must try! Outside of the Canadian border, this is quite possibly the best poutine I've had. On top of that, service is always great and employees can't be friendlier."}
{"text":"Emporio is a very unique and modern restaurant. They have an extensive list of beers to choose from and many creative food options! You can literally have a meatball any way you want. The service was good, our waitress was knowledgeable with food recommendations and drink pairings. I am looking forward to coming back to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The price was a bit much for lunch. Nobody wants to spend $20 for 3 meatballs and a side. Granted that side was the Mac and Cheese, and that Mac and Cheese was the best I have ever had north of the Mason-Dixon Line."}
{"text":"Alec Baldwin would approve. It's all things balls, even in limited time gyro disguise (assuming one opts for the grinder). There's a ball for everyone - choose wisely. The parmesan broccoli is a great healthy side full o' flavor, but who are we kidding people...whet your appetite with the pepperoni fritters served w/ their almost famous tangy marinara sauce. Then, wash it all down with one of the their many craft beers - roughly 30 taps at your disposal. Emporio's strip mall location in Wexford loses some of its appeal compared to the O.G. downtown location, but if you're looking to mix things up go 'head and check it out."}
{"text":"$2 meatball slider mondays... Nuff' said. Also, pay no attention to the kerosene smell inside during the winter months -__-"}
{"text":"With a name that includes a meatball joint in it, I expected well, amazing meatballs, robust, flavorful, just something that would overwhelm my senses, to bad for me, not fake news but nowhere remotely near to what I or anyone in my group expected, to say it was a disappointment is to put it lightly. 

The decor of the restaurant is however very modern with a soho style hipster vibe"}
{"text":"This place is good! At first I thought, \"meatballs??\" 

These are some damn good meatballs and I love how you can lick your sauce, too. The chicken meatball was my fave and the traditional beef one was surprisingly my least fave out of the bunch (I tried them all) lol. 

Poutine fries are bomb. Spaetzle was just ok for me but maybe you just have to like spaetzle to like it."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I went pretty boring with my choices because I got overwhelmed. I had the beef meatball grinder with provolone and marinara sauce. We also got a side of fries to share. I really liked the grinder, it was ginormous with 3 huge meatballs. It was really good and I would get it again. I wasn't a huge fan of the fries, there wasn't a lot of flavor. I would definitely go back and now that I know what to expect I'd be more willing to try something different!"}
{"text":"3.5/5 stars

Food: good portions, a tad on the too salty side, very heavy (makes you full fast)

Price: reasonable for the food you receive 

Service: the food came very fast, service was very slow-he came to take our order at least 20 minutes after we were seated, host and server were relatively friendly 

Seating/atmosphere: a good amount of seating, clean restaurant, TVs with sports on"}
{"text":"Good food, fun ambiance. A friend recommended this place. We over ordered - pepperoni fritters, cheesy bread, poutine, pickle chips. I should have only ordered a meatball slider (which was another recommendation from a fellow foodie) after so many appetizers but I had yummy leftovers the following morning before the Steelers game.  The only thing I would not do again is the poutine but, side note: I also got the sauce on the side (in case it was too spicy for the kids). In hindsight, it probably would have better ON the fries. 

The server explained how the meatball selection works. It was a bit overwhelming so all of us went with the preset bowls. I got the Thatsa-Spicy-Meat-a-Ball! spicy pork balls, cheese tortellini arrabbiata, jalapeños. It was spicy but good. Comes with 2 meatballs but you can add 2 more for $4 extra. 

The kids spaghetti was generously sized. Enough for leftovers the next day. Then again, they also filled up on appetizers. 

My friend and I tried the strawberry and pineapple beers. She didn't care for it and our waitress was nice enough to let her switch out her drink. Good service! 

Tips: Use the No Wait App. We were #21 when we got in queue on the app and by the time we got out of our Uber and arrived at the restaurant we were #6. We barely finished our drinks at the rooftop beer garden when our table was ready. 

T-shirts available by the hostess stand"}
{"text":"My friends and I hit up emporia downtown at 11 am on a Saturday morning. It was one of the more affordable options downtown open at that hour. We were looking to fill out stomachs with the first meal of the day without paying a dinner prices. The service was really nice since we were seated right away and greeted with smiles at the door. The server was nice enough to offer suggestions and refill our water frequently. I had the meatball grinder with chicken balls, provolone cheese, and marinara sauce. It was a delight!!! I can't wait to go back and try another sauce. The meatballs were plenty big for me. I may have actually stuffed myself that day. The table also shared a plate of poutines with fires which was a nice starter. The food also came out rather quickly and everything was correct for everyone's order. I'm definitely a fan."}
