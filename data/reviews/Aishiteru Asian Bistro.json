{"text":"I have been here 3 times. Twice I ordered the orange chicken lunch special. I loved it. It was crispy and not breaded or soggy. Amazing flavor in the sauce. Fried rice was good, not super special but good. Miso soup on one occasion. Hot and sour soup on the other 2. All great. Salad, don't bother, it was tiny and nothing in it except iceberg lettuce and a little dressing. Sushi lunch special was good but not amazing. Good price though. The service it great. Hot tea for $1. Can't beat the prices there. I'll keep going here for sure and can't wait to bring my brother who is a huge orange chicken fan."}
{"text":"Amazing food great atmosphere and good service fresh sushi and great prices definitely recommend you to stop by and enjoy good food!!"}
{"text":"My review is based on their Chinese food entrees. I have yet to try the sushi which I will soon! I was craving Chinese food one night and I usually ordered from the previous business noodle and rice. Sadly, I found out they were closing business and this new restaurant took over. It was close to home so I gave it a shot! I always thought noodle and rice has good food. BUT this place was superb. I had ordered take out multiple times already and I haven't been disappointed yet. Each time, My order was consistently the same flavor and size. They do give you a lot of food here in my opinion. I love their flavor.. so far, I had their shrimp kung pao, potsticker, house fried rice and house yakisoba noodle (lo mein)... every single dish was de-lish!  Just found out they have pad Thai on the menu.. can't wait to try that and sushi!! Will update about sushi later!"}
{"text":"My husband & I love Aishiteru Asian Bistro, they have good Chinese & Japanesse food, especially the sushi:  Caterpillar Rolls.
It won't be a waste of your time"}
{"text":"We are from socal and have been spoiled with excellent asian cuisine and of course fresh sushi.  This place delivers.  It's not generic food and everything is fresh.  Delivery is great.  Will eat again and again!"}
{"text":"I was on my vacation to visit my friend at Phoenix,AZ and they brought me for dinner to this restaurant. We ordered Poke Tuna Salad for starter and i got orange chicken for my dinner. My friend was ordered beef yakisoba and his girl friend was ordered eel sushi. The food is pretty decent and the price is on the range. The portion is enough for one person. The orange chicken sauce is not too sour and not too sweet. Its just perfect. I really like the poke tuna and the sauce that really melted on my mouth.overall its not too overpriced and recommended to try."}
{"text":"You see, I'm unintentionally a snob when it comes to food, because when you are used to plethora of choices of best of the best, you have come to expect it at all time. But, I kid you not, this has surpassed my SoCal Snobish Culinary Standard. 

My friends and I came here to try out the recently open establishment by their house.
 We got Pot Stickers, Orange Chicken, House Yakisoba and Hot Night Roll. 
They are all surprisingly REALLY GOOD and pocket friendly!

Hot Night Roll
Okay must NOT skip their sushi/sashimi/roll selections. 
This, I must say, surpassed my expectation on small establishment with lower pricing point. 
They actually used high quality seafood and slight sauce. I was expecting the otherwise as it would've been the normal for a cheaper Rolls. I would've ordered more had I knew. 

The Pot Stickers
Crispy on the outside moist on the inside, try to dip the pot sticker in chili oil sauce AFTER you dip it in its sauce. 

Orange Chicken
These days every other asian restaurant carries orange chicken, a few got it right on all three ingredients like this guys.
Sauce: Tangy with medium hint of orange and not too sweet
Breading: Crispy but it is ever-slightly present that I'm happily report that it doesn't feel like you are eating Colonel Sander's Original Crispy Recipe. 
Chicken: Tender and Succulent, cooked just enough time. You guys, it is rare to find non overcooked orange chicken. 

House Yakisoba
The portion is generous, and they tasted delish."}
{"text":"Great sushi!! New restaurant tucked in a tiny strip mall. The sushi and rolls were great. They gave us free salad to try as they have only been open for 3 weeks. No alcohol served in this joint yet. I can't wait to try their orange chicken and other Chinese dishes next time."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for the family tonight and the food was great. Ordered the sushi deluxe which includes a California roll and 6 nigiri, chef choice. One of the best cali rolls I've had and the nigiri was great. I'm a huge crab puff fan and I have to say, they have my new favorite crab puff. Tons of cream cheese! We also ordered the sesame chicken dinner combo and it was very good with a generous amount of chicken and fried rice. Overall, really pleased and will definitely order from there again."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try out the recently opened Aishiteru Asian Bistro. I had been visiting Noodle and Rice (the previous restaurant in this spot) for many years - so needless to say they had big shoes to fill. From the moment we walked in, Jackie the owner made us feel right at home. He is a very sweet and humble man who is driven to earn you're business. Not only do they give you big, delicious portions, but it's inexpensive! You can get one of 10 different dinner entrees for 7.95! Plus if you check in with this app you get a free California Roll. I give this place my highest recommendation and I pray you check it out!"}
{"text":"I remember when this place was Noodle & Rice Cafe and I heard good reviews about Aishiteru Bistro. I called in an order last night and was told they have a new menu. What they failed to tell me is that it's no longer Aishiteru Bistro. It is now named China Chef Bistro and its grand opening on January 2, 2018. The orange chicken was good, the portion wasn't much to share. The chicken & broccoli sauce was flavorless and the chicken was mushy."}
{"text":"I have known Jacky and Melani for a while now and this is their second restaurant in AZ. They are the most friendly restaurant owners around and I love the food there since Jackie will allow me to customized the food. Everybody should try their general tso chicken, sushi and their hot and sour soup are top notch."}
{"text":"This place is a friendly, family run place. Food is consistently good and portions are large. Prices are super low too and great lunch specials which include soup and egg roll.  They will customize most dishes as well to your liking."}
{"text":"My second attempt with this restaurant went well. Great dumplings and sauces.  Delivery took less than 20 minutes.  I recommend the  pork Katsu and Yakisoba noodles!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great people. I often come for lunch hour and order a sushi roll or two. Great prices for terrific food :)"}
{"text":"Lovely family Owned place , been there few times and always the food was good love the poke salad the fish is always fresh and taste great and it comes with a choice of soup which all are great , egg drop , sweet and sour or miso ."}
{"text":"My cuz and I came for happy hour and the reviews looked good.  We ordered crab puffs, sushi and sashimi combo which consisted of albacore, shrimp, white tuna, yellowtail, salmon and a spicy tuna roll.  The hot and sour soup that came with our combo wasn't great.  It lacked heat and vinegar.  However, the egg roll that also came with the combo was delicious.  The crab puffs were nicely fried but the filling only came with cream cheese and no crab meat and green onions like typical crab puffs.  The sushi was fresh and tasty.  Overall, 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"My takeout order wasn't ready when I arrived but the woman working offered me wonton crackers, miso, and a drink on the house while I waited. Would definitely come back here again just for the service. :)"}
{"text":"Are you a fan of really good sushi and sashimi but your budget constrains you from enjoying these more often? Then this is the place for you! The modest interior and prices belie the excellent quality and quantity of their food. I went here for lunch and ordered the sushi and sashimi lunch special, which I considered a good deal at $11.99 (they offer other lunch specials which cost less). It consisted of an 8-piece sushi roll (I chose spicy salmon but you can also choose California roll), four pieces of nigiri, and three pieces of sashimi. The special comes with soup or salad; I ordered egg drop soup (miso soup was the other choice). Everything was superb, and the fish was so very fresh. High-end sushi restaurant quality without the high-end price! I highly recommend this place. Please note that it may be a bit tricky to find - it's in the middle of a strip mall where the strip is perpendicular, not parallel, to the road; From the road you may not see the storefront since it is in the middle of the row of stores. Thanks, yelp, for putting this gem in the \"hot new places\" list - I might not have found it otherwise!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Generous portions at an excellent price. The staff is friendly and welcoming. Lunch specials are SO good!!!"}
{"text":"I called in for pick-up and was informed that Aishiteru is no longer in business and that they have a new menu and new owners. Craving Chinese food, my friend and I decided to give the new place (China Chef Bistro) a try, and we are so glad we did!! I ordered the BBQ Pork Fried Rice and it was absolutely delicious! Every bite was so flavorful that I couldn't stop eating it.. I also ordered the Egg Drop Soup which was very hot and fresh. Definitely one of the best Egg Drop Soups I've ever had. My friend ordered the orange chicken which he also enjoyed. For what you get and the quality, we think the prices are fair. Everyone at the restaurant including the owner was really friendly and inviting too. I don't know why people are so upset that the menu has changed - I mean they are a completely different restaurant, of course their menu is not going to be identical to the old one? Anyways, I highly recommend this place and will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Came in for a pregnancy craving and was not disappointed! Started with a ginger salad, egg drop soup and fries all amazing! Didn't even need soy sauce for the soup. We got the General Tso chicken loved it not super spicy but loves the garlic and the sweet and sour chicken it was amazing didn't even realize how much was eatten. Staff is friendly and awesome"}
{"text":"Super nice people with great food. 

My wife is s bit of a sushi snob and she loves theirs. I like sushi alright but prefer Chinese food. We can get both. 

We really liked Noodles and Rice (the restaurant that used to be in this location) and was sad to see them close - but Aishiteru is wonderful."}
{"text":"Wow! This is one great place to eat. The prices are low, almost too low for what you get. What do you get? Well, for starters, the quality of the food is top notch, something you would expect to find at 5 star restaurants. The quality of sushi is amazing, the flavors are so rich, and the presentation makes you want to eat and eat. You must come in and experience Aishiteru!"}
{"text":"This resturaunt has taken over a space from our friends of many years,Noodle and Rice.the owner and family are very accommodating, and the service is very nice. Pricing is very good for the quality of the fresh fish used in the sushi that we have been eating for a couple of months. I have seen the lunch specials prepared for other customers and it all looks well prepared,and everyone seemed quite happy,and have returned time and time again. They are the only sushi and Asian resturaunt in our area. There is a tai resturaunt next to a transmission shop ,but it's terrible. They have a great lunch special 3 six piece sushi rolls for only $11.99!"}
{"text":"Really affordable food that is quite tasty. My husband and I would go to the previous establishment Noodles and Rice weekly. When this opened we were happy to give it a shot. My favorites are the General Tso and Orange Chicken. Their ginger dressing is quite nice. My only complaints are the cucumber salad has way to much vinegar and the tea doesn't taste very good. Excellent service and has become our weekly lazy night dinner."}
{"text":"I ordered through the Eat24 app for pickup. Great $6 lunch specials, it was ready fast!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good Chinese restaurant in the area. I received a flyer for this place and decided to give it a try. The service was fast and good. The dinner specials are a lot of food for a reasonable price. I will come back in the future."}
{"text":"So, on my way home from the office, this restaurant came up on the  hot and new list in my area. (Not sure if its hot or new but it popped up that way) I was in the mood to try something different and Asian Fusion seemed \"just the ticket!\" Following mapquest like a drone bee, I find my destination is a small strip mall near Cave Creek  and 20th street. You may be thinking HUH, this isn't looking good...but I'm not deterred. I've found so many hidden gems in small strip malls in \"shifting\" neighborhoods (I live nearby so Im allowed to think that) that I know better than to base opinions on anything other than the food and service. 
I walk in and am greeted so warmly. I use my Yelp check in for my free roll and am amazed when the waitress, realizing it's my first time, offers up some free soup to try! 2 kinds even! This is AFTER she knows I won't be dining in. Now some other servers may be inclined to provide limited service thinking the tip won't be worth the extra work anyway. Not this gal. She continues to be extra pleasant and accomodating. Even when I request a roll not on the menu. Good on her because I am a great tipper dine in or dine out! (If I do say so myself)
The interior is clean :) and cool despite record degree temps! The entire space is not very large but doesn't feel cramped. There are benches along the full length of each wall where 3 tables with room for 4 at each are positioned in front of them. When you first walk in there are also 2 tables for 4 in a semi private alcove to your left. Very cozy.
I decide to order for myself and the hubby (he'd do the same for me right?) getting sesame chicken, pork katsu, the free (check in) california roll, and 2 sushicado rolls, the first with spicy tuna for him and the other non spicy for me. Sushicado roll is avocado, cucumber and red (ahi) tuna. 
Unfortunately this ends the positive portion of my review.  Well, the glowing praise portion anyway. 
My take out order was assembled in some sort of box lid which wouldn't be horrible except this lid appeared to be the version that requires a fold over and fold under in order to stay together. It was extremely precarious to say the least. I'm sorry environment, I'd prefer a plastic bag. But that's easily forgiven.
The food: hmm this is probably not going on my list of favorites. The free california roll was presented with seaweed on the outside I didn't care for the taste of the rice or for the crab filling for that matter. The rice provided witb the entree was bit skimpy for the 35 dollars I spent. One Chinese to go container represented the rice. Plain, not fried rice. The sesame chicken was chewy with a slightly sweet flavor. The Katsu although breaded nicely lacked any real flavor. Not horrible but with all the choices in the valley, (not to mention one of my favorites  Sushi Bros pretty close at Dunlap and 19th Ave.. which frankly blows this restaurant out of the water..)this one will probably not get a second date.  I was genuinely disappointed because I was looking forward to the Chinese/Japanese fusion this place appeared to be attempting. 
I gave 4 stars because there wasn't anything offensive about the restaurant, high marks on cleanliness and friendliness and average to below average in flavor and bang for the buck. If you try this place you may want to go with alternate choices the other reviewers found better such as the ramen or alternate rolls. 

."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. I typically stop by once a week (and would stop by more often if I worked near by). The food is fresh and tasty. If you like California rolls, these are the best. 

The menu has mostly Japanese inspired dishes, but you can also find some old time favorites including egg drop soup and Panang curry. You cannot go wrong here.

The staff is friendly and personable. 

Take a look at the menu, you cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Tried this little Bistro for the first time tonight. I got the sweet and sour chicken, and crab puffs. The chicken was good and not overly cooked. And not just all batter. The crab puffs were slightly sweet, but pretty tasty.  Inside decor was similar to previous owners. I will order carryout from them again."}
{"text":"NEW OWNERS!  AS OF DECEMBER 30TH 2017. NOT the same quality! We loved this place.  The orange chicken was the best we have ever had!  The rolls were awesome.  The house noodles where really tasty.  NOT ANYMORE!  Don't go off other reviews before mine.  We won't be ordering from them now."}
{"text":"This place is small. food and workers are wonderful. We asked for things and received everything fast and with a smile. No alcohol yet. The meat is very fresh and egg soup wonderful! Everthing fast and hot. Keep up the great work . defiantly will be back."}
{"text":"Just had sushi and some vegetable tempura. The food is great... I had yellowtail tuna, spicy tuna roll and eel. The sushi is very fresh and reasonably priced. The owner Jackie and his wife are very nice. I'll be back again to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Stopped to grab a bite on my way home. I learned that it was a new place.  Order Poke Tuna salad, 3 rolls and soup. Everything was fresh and delicious.. reasonably priced.. service was excellent and friendly. My new place for my Asian fix!!"}
{"text":"Très contents, nous reviendrons très certainement ! Nous avons pris la formule Dinner Combo ! Bon rapport  qualite, prix, service. Perfect we will come back soon!"}
{"text":"Was hungry for late night fried rice. Ordered chicken fried rice, orange chicken, and house noodles. All were excellent. So relieved to have such a great place nearby looking forward to trying there other dishes."}
{"text":"Hidden gem great prices and very nice staff. Good choices for every palette. My family has tried many items and have enjoyed all of them."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and great delivery service.  The food is very flavorful and I love the variety.  Will be a staple in the future."}
{"text":"We decided on some Japanese food after some hot and heavy action at Let it Roll. We arrived a little later so there was no wait. 

The service was great, if not a little redundant. Two separate waiters were helping us and not communicating, but like I said, it was slow I'm sure they were a little bored. 

I ordered the Alaska roll and some teriyaki chicken while my date had the sashimi combo. 

I was impressed by their miso soup, it had a nice flavor. The teriyaki chicken was thoroughly average. The texture, like a few have said, was strange. A little rubbery. Might be something to note if the chef is reading. The spring roll that came alongside was a little mushy. But the roll itself was very good. The sashimi also got rave reviews.

I'll come here again and probably try a different entree and another roll."}
{"text":"Do not let the black film on the windows turn you away. I almost didn't go in but I'm glad I did. The owner Jackie made me an unbelievable role. This is a mom-and-pop sushi place but it is awesome. Can't stand the chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Great sushi! A lot of great options in the menu but for us the sushi is what truly shines."}
{"text":"Best sushi around. Owner really cares about the customer and is super nice. It's nice to see humility and the desire to please the customer. Try it out!"}
{"text":"While I do miss Teresa and Noodle & Rice, the owner of Aishiteru has made the experience amazing from Day 1 of trying this place out. I have been well received and respected as a customer and I couldn't imagine going anywhere else at this point. The food is great, the redesign of the main area is way better suited to customers and I haven't been upset with the food at all. Please keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Great experience on our 1st delivery order. Service was prompt - Actually like lightning it was so fast. LOL Food was fresh & hot & the staff was friendly & accommodating. We can't wait to try the Sushi in person."}
{"text":"Placed order on Yelp24 for delivery from here at 7:42. No delivery as of 90 minutes later. I live 5 minutes from the restaurant. Sorry, both the restaurant AND YELP EAT24 are a MASSIVE FAIL!"}
{"text":"First time I am here with my family and the whole dinner experience is just wonderful. And not to mention that the food is excellent."}
{"text":"I was bummed when I heard about the place prior closing but they have definitely filled the gap and more. Ordered the Shrimp Yakisoba dinner special to go and everything was awesome, they even called to let me know that my order was going to be ready early. That and the great food is how you keep people coming back."}
{"text":"Great food, tried the sushi, dinner combo and a couple appetizers, all delicious. Great service as well. Will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot with $6 specials that come with really good miso soup or salad. I had the sushi combo with CA roll--very simple, but very fresh and good. We ordered calamari as an appetizer--nothing special. My friend had Yaki Soba which had nice big, juicy shrimp...served with egg roll (fried) and fried rice. It would've been better if they skipped the rice and piled up some nice stir fried veggies. I'd like the option for a fresh spring roll (not fried) or maybe seaweed salad or something else not fried. The staff is really friendly and accommodating. Did you know the name of this restaurant, although difficult to say, means, \"I love you\" in Japanese."}
{"text":"Great service and has the best California Roll I've ever had in the Phoenix area. Great quality chicken and fish here. Ever since I've had this place I haven't gone to another Asian restaurant in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"UPDATE: This restaurant is no longer the amazing Aishiteru restaurant I knew so well. These \"China chef bistro\" IMPOSTORS are a DISGRACE to Aishiteru. I walked in, shocked, upset and in absolute disbelief. They took my shrimp yakisoba off the menu and the closest thing was shrimp lo mein. We ordered to go. Spent $25 dollars on two damn entrees. And the portions were way smaller. We go home. I wearily open the box and start eating. Doesn't taste the same. Then I see a small black line wrapped around a shrimp. It was a HAIR. I call immediately, and their phone has problems so they hung up. I call back & they say they need to talk to the owner. Between the time she hung up and called back again, with my flashlight I spot ANOTHER small, black hair (which I don't have) connected to a noodle. She calls back and at this point I'm just so done I don't even care about the entree refund she offered me. I just want all my money back. Because of this reason: after I hang up my mom gives me some of her white rice & teriyaki sauce. I start scarfing it down because I'm hungry! And after a few bites I touch the spoon to my lips and feel....can you guess... A HAIR. ANOTHER F'N HAIR!! Don't even care about my money, keep it & you'll need it cause I'm calling the Health Department 
ABSOLUTELY Unacceptable.
-------------------
Such a great restaurant tucked away with a big ol QT in its way. This is a must go to restaurant for affordable, delicious food made with love! The owner is the sweetest man, and really cares about your experience. I ordered the Shrimp yakisoba lunch special which includes noodles fried with shrimp, fried rice, an egg roll and soup or salad for only 6.95! (The salad had amazing ginger dressing, great refreshing starter) My boyfriend ordered the curry special with tofu and rice, which is devoured! Will be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Really great food. Inconspicuous location. Very friendly staff too! This will be my new go-to place for Asian food. Increasing variety of dishes, too. The menu seems to keep expanding, which is great. It doesn't hurt that it's only a thousand feet from my house either! Give them a chance for sure."}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn great. It's tucked away right next to a QT in a strip mall, and although the outside isn't the most inviting (tinted glass), the service and the food are well worth it. My waitress was patient (I am a poor decision maker) but also very attentive (noticing when I closed my menu, for example). I went there for lunch in the middle of the day--it was quiet, the food was great, and cheap! I ordered the pork katsu off the lunch menu, which came with an egg roll, choice of soup (miso, egg drop, hot and sour. I chose the hot and sour) or salad, and fried rice! The katsu had a good level of sauce, was PERFECTLY crispy, and the whole meal was incredibly filling. 

Would definitely recommend for a quick, tasty lunch"}
{"text":"I've been there on 3 occasions and have had a sampling
of apps, soup, salad, sushi and chinese dishes.
All very good.
Friendly and professional staff.
Weekly stop for me."}
{"text":"Really awesome place for a quick delicious bite! So far I've had the sushi- pretty good, Kat's chicken- heck ya, yummy, and the sesame chicken- yummmm! The service has been great too very friendly and love that they deliver!"}
{"text":"Food is great!   I keep coming back.    I'll have to try the sushi next time or for lunch."}
{"text":"The Pork Katsu is second to none. My son who order it can not stop to brag about it. Also The Hot Night Sushi and Spider Sushi are so delicious. It is a must have sushi in town!!! I will definitely gonna come again."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place by chance. Found friendly efficient staff and an engaged owner. The food was well prepared with quality ingredients. Go. You'll like it."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant thinking it was Noodles and Rice (previous restaurant). So I wanted to have the Thai noodles we usually get. This new restaurant serves Japanese (instead of Thai) and Chinese dishes. We were delightfully surprised because my daughter loved the sweet and sour plate she used to get and it was very similar, but I think it was better because they used real fresh pineapple and the chicken was light and crispy. Plus the sauce was perfect. She got egg drop soup, fried rice, a crab puff, and an egg roll at a great price and it was a big portion. I ordered the ramen with 3 thick pieces of chashu pork and a boiled egg. The taste was good. We ordered the gyoza potstickers and it was a little over crispy, but the taste was good. We got the California roll (5 pcs) and they we very big pieces. It's a little sweeter than what I like, but still tasted good. The waiter and waitress was very nice and was very attentive.  The prices was great as well."}
{"text":"Went last night for an early dinner to try the new Asian restaurant by us.  It was very good.  The egg drop soup was probably the best I've ever had. The chef and waitress were very nice.  Happy to have a new restaurant in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Saw the signs for the grand opening and decided to check this new place out for lunch. Ordered the Chicken Katsu and a California roll. The lunch special came with free crispy wontons and choice of soup, I got Hot n sour for me and egg drop soup for my daughter. The California roll was delicious and packed with crab meat. 
  The food came out quickly and the service was excellent. Can't wait to bring the rest of the family. Definitely recommend if you're in the mood for Japanese/Chinese food!"}
{"text":"We tried this place and were very disappointed. We ordered 2 different chicken dishes and they both tasted bland and super similar. No spices, no heat, nothing. I had a lot of food leftover and I did not even want to take it home. The rice is bland as well. Visiting this restaurant just made us miss the previous restaurant that was there, Noodles & Rice. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great price!! Very recommended!! The orange chicken so bomb!! Love it!!"}
{"text":"Great fast service! Got free California roll and spicy tuna roll. First timers get a free soup! Customer service was excellent. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi at great prices. I'm the first non-5 star review apparently. Let's be real, this isn't 5 star sushi but it is darn good...especially for the price! And no alcohol license yet as of 4-28-17 so had to have diet coke instead of Kirin or Sake with my sushi. I will still be back though. The 3 rolls for $11.95 deal is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly working people, they have best sushi and fresh fish . And they have variations food and they have good orange chicken"}
{"text":"Walked in to get an order pick up. It was late and they were close to closing but they were so kind and welcoming. It was my first time coming here and the people were kind and generous. Truly genuine people. The food is delicious! Will be coming back, and will definitely be recommending to my friends. If the owners/employees see this, thanks so much for being kind people and making delicious food!"}
{"text":"I placed my order on Yelp before I left work and my food was ready to go when I arrived. Everything we ordered was delicious and the portions were more than enough. The prices are WAY more reasonable than anything in my neighborhood too. I'll definitely be coming back to Aishiteru."}
{"text":"We went to this new restaurant thinking the old owners were still there. What a great surprise the dinners were! They were fresh, delicious and reasonably priced. We will be steady customers."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from out of town for work. This was nearby my hotel so I decided to give it a try and was not disappointed. Staff and chef were friendly and prompt. They gave me soup free of charge, and the sushi I had was delicious. If I'm back in Phoenix, I'll definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Cute little place, the service and food are superb !!
We got seaweed salad, fried chicken wings and fried calamari for starter. Orange chicken, House fried rice, Hot night roll and California roll for our meal and we LOVE everything !!
Will be back and try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"1115am on Thursday. Place is clean service was friendly and quick. Ordered teka maki which was fresh tasting. It also came with my choice of soup.. egg drop, sweet and sour or miso.  i had miso.  It was hot and tasted great. Prices were fair too.  If looking for a no frills quick, fair priced place to satiate that sushi pang then this seems to be it.  
I'll have to try more stuff the next time I'm in area and give an update."}
{"text":"Great quick lunch specials. Loved the crispy Orange Chicken. The Hot and Sour Soup had the perfect broth and spice level.  Family run business that is a good lunch option."}
{"text":"Maybe we ordered on a bad night? Maybe I'm too picky? Or maybe it just isn't every going to be my go-to restaurant in the neighborhood.
Friday I ordered delivery.
Their idea of spring rolls, is my idea of an egg roll.
Their idea of a dinner special is 2 giant scoops of fried rice,  some chewy, rubbery, orange chicken, and a couple more of those \"spring rolls\"
Everything was the same color too.
The cream cheese won tons were actually pretty good. The Chicken yakisoba was about a thousand times better than the orange chicken dinner special, but still, the chicken had a strange texture. 
The delivery was definitely very slow, since the food took over an hour to come 2 miles, but I'm not taking that into account in this review. It happens. 
I will most likely try this place again just to be sure this wasn't a fluke.
If my opinion changes, I'll let y'all know"}
{"text":"This restaurant has opened in place of Noodles and Rice. Service was very good, kind n sweet family, courteous, food not that great. Not hygienic, had flies and ants crawling in the drink and food. We left our entire entree dish behind, the chicken was too hard, stringy, chubbery. Orange Chicken is a BIG NO! Not recommended for lack of cleanliness. Take out should work great, did not visit their Kitchen though. Wish we could return :("}
{"text":"We went to the last place (Noodles and Rice) for many years, and were sad they were closing. Luckily, the Bistro is just as good!! We went with the basics to start, Teriyaki chix and Sesame chix. Both were good sized portions with light, non-gooey sauces. Lots of flavor. And the chix was lightly cooked to perfection. 
The owner and server were very gracious and welcoming. The owner stopped by to see if we were happy (we were!). It sounds like they have been getting business, which makes me very happy!


Next time... Sushi!! (Homer droooool)......."}
{"text":"I used to be a dedicated regular of the recently closed Noodles and Rice, so I decided to give the new tenant, Ashiteru, a try. Big mistake! The waitress didn't seem to know the menu and struggled taking our order. The gyoza were overcooked, and the yakisoba lacked taste. In fact, the chicken in the yakisoba was downright rubbery. This wasn't even the worst part. That came shortly after we got the food, and the table next to us had to move because they started seeing bugs climbing over their seats. Needless to say, I will never return here."}
{"text":"Great food! Great prices! I've eaten in, taken out, and delivered. Pictures are from takeout. I was surprised to see the care taken that other restaurants skip for takeout orders. Can't wait to try more of their entrees"}
{"text":"Delicious! My boyfriend and I are having a staycation at the Point Hilton and decided to give this place a try! We got the orange chicken and sesame chicken dinner combos. Tons of food! They delivered to our hotel and the food was nice, hot and tasty. Definitely will try this place again."}
{"text":"This restaurant now occupies the former Noodles and Rice

We ordered the Katsu Lunch Plate, Sesame Chicken Lunch Plate and Shrimp Yakasoba Lunch Plate. Each lunch plate comes with a soup, either Egg Drop Soup or Hot and Sour Soup, Egg Roll and Rice (white or fried)

Through Yelp check in, there was a free order of California Roll.

I liked the owners of the restaurant, they were very nice and inviting.

Prices for lunch were very reasonable while the food was plentiful and pretty good. For the money, was a good buy and the menu is quite a good selection of Chinese and Japenese.

I would like to come back to try other dishes."}
