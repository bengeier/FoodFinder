{"text":"Found this portuguese place by fluke. . . righteous munchies!!!!  hot table . . .  * grilled squid * traditional portuguese bean stew * contemporary portuguese sausage/beef stew * grilled sardines/smelts * fried fish fillets (sole) etc.  Ordered fried fish fillets to-go. Literally tore open take-out container second I peeled out of the place. Deeeeelish . . .moist tender - hint of lemon  Also picked-up grilled chicken sandwich with traditional portuguese piri-piri hot sauce. Chicken nicely charred on the ouside - tender juicy on the inside. Awesome!!!  FOOD: 4.5/5 SERVICE: 4.0 PRICE: 5.0"}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for years but recently moved very close to Rui's and it quickly became my go-to for those nights I just don't feel like cooking. Many Portuguese places in the area ruin a perfectly good chicken with too much salt but Rui's isn't heavy handed in their seasoning. They let their incredible sauces do the work. Daily specials are always fun to try - just point to the cod and order and be happy."}
{"text":"Best churrasco I've found in Toronto!  I've been to St. Clair's, Sardinha (now \"The Rooster\"), Costa Verde, etc., all the usual suspects and this is HANDS DOWN the best chicken I've had.  I haven't had anything but the chicken, mind you, but I've had one rotisserie and one grilled and I'm amazed with both.    I don't even like rotisserie chicken as the flavour always fails to get through to the bone and I hate bland chicken.  Rui's rotisserie is better than most Portuguese grilled chicken I've had and their grilled is simply unsurpassed in Toronto as far as I can tell.  Why?  Rotisserie chicken - wings are super crispy while breast is somehow still juicy.  It's all flavourful, even the breast is more flavourful than you'd expect.  The flavour is not salt, it's actual seasoning/flavour.  Actually, this is the first churrasco place I've ever gotten chicken from where I bit into a \"piece\" of seasoning (some type of plant that tasted pickled and yummy).  They don't just use a sauce - they obviously make a seasoning sauce from real, solid ingredients from scratch and it's tasty.  Grilled chicken - SUPER FLAVOURFUL.  Just amazing.  The flavour is just the best I've had in Toronto, by a margin.  Better than their rotisserie by 30% to 50%, in my opinion (and I rated their rotisserie as above most grilled in the city).  Piri-Piri sauce - made in-house and tasty!  Creamy and more substantial than many of the Frank's Red Hot Sauce knockoffs that I get at most churrasco places.  Get this - the sauce ALONE is tasty!  I've never just eaten piri-piri sauce on its own but I find myself just dipping my finger in this and sucking it off like it was a dish in itself.  There were literally no drawbacks to my meal and I was impressed with each individual component!  And the service was awesome as well!  I have found my new go-to churrasco spot!  I hope they stay open forever!"}
{"text":"Some of the best grilled chicken in the city!! My usual place is St Matthews but I never get the sides there because I don't like their taste. At Rui's though I always end up getting way too much food because everything is delicious! Definitely give their meat and veggies medley a try... amazing!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food at great prices. The service is extremely friendly and always accommodating. Parking is a bit tough but you can normally get away with finding a spot on weston or one of the side streets. They have a different set of meals every day so checking out the menu beforehand may be worthwhile since what you had on Friday wont be available on Saturday. Also not all the servers are fluent in English and there are no food signs on the plexi glass so check out the menu to understand what's being served and pointing goes a long way."}
{"text":"Food is very fresh. The lady who works there is very friendly. The roasted chicken is juicy and got the flavor in it."}
{"text":"Great place for takeout, the sauce on the chicken is honest to god magical and the hot sauce is the the gem that keeps me coming back.  Never go wrong with Rui's!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place.  Great food and great prices.  When you're done here you can head 1 block east and hit the Portuguese bakery.  More great food and great prices."}
{"text":"Awesome food , freshly prepared, best BBQ chicken in the area .... you must try their Piri piri sauce.... we've also tried the veal stew with chorizo and shrimp as well as the salt cod with potatoes . Different specials everyday . Very friendly staff as well . Not easy task to be one of the best Portuguese churascos on Rogers road , but they do it well"}
{"text":"My husband and I saw this place with 5 stars review from 11 reviewers so we decided to check it out.  It is located inside of a super market without parking lot. Therefore, you have to park along the street. The server doesn't speak very little English and seemed reluctant to serve you.    My husband ordered veal, which was good.  However, the portion was very small.  I ordered something which I ask what it is and the lady said it is chicken. The meat was inside a curry colored both, so I couldn't see how the meat look like until she scooped it out.    After taking the first bite, I realized it is chicken gizzard.  She gave me a huge portion of gizzard, which must me about 30 gizzards!  I reluctantly ate about 7 of them and can't force myself to eat any more. My husband at 1 piece and confirmed it is gizzards. We are both good cook and adventurous eaters, but we had no desire to take another gizzard.  The rice came with it was good. The salad was okay.  If I have known that is chicken gizzards, then I would NOT order it.  The cashier told me it is chicken and the menu said the same.  We will NOT return after this experience."}
{"text":"My best friend's mom ordered a large order for her birthday just a few weekends ago. This was my first time eating chicken + sides from this place but apparently they raved about it and \"only go here\" - now I know why!  The grilled chicken was absolutely delicious. Even though it was well done, it was not dry at all and extremely flavourful - even without their delicious piri piri sauce (which I highly recommend, wish I could eat that by the spoonful lol).  They also got French fries, potatoes, side salad and leitao. I personally do not eat pork (I know, shocking) so I am unable to comment on the taste but by the moans and ZERO leftovers left, I would say it was a \"hit\".  Everything she got was yummy and I am excited to go back and grab some dinner from this place and a gallon of hot sauce ;)"}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable prices. I definitely  recommend and will be back!  Churra's can be tricky - often I find the salt a little much but I really have no complaints here the favours are perfectly balanced.  This is legitimate Portuguese food and a great representation of what they eat at home. It is also a very clean establishment!"}
