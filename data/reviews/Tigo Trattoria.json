{"text":"Went to Tigo tonight had Gnocchi Bolognese. Very good. Highly recommended. Amazing service. The owner went out if his way to make us feel welcome. Quaint and cozy venue. Great for a first date."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining here during a business trip last week. Being from North Jersey, one might call me a snob when it comes to Italian cuisine. I would have never thought I would find decent Italian in of all places, Canada! I was seriously apprehensive that I was going to get a decent meal when I pulled up in the strip mall the restaurant is located in. NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER! This place had me blown away when I walked in - ambiance was modern, a fully stocked wine racked wall, the entire back wall was fully stocked bar. The place is small but elegantly decorated, and the staff was super attentive. Food was some of the best I ever had - I got a half order of Tagliatelle alla Milena (wow!) and Pollo al limone, the chicken was so tender and flavorful! My Nona would be so upset if I said that this place would give her a run for her money! I highly recommend this place if you are ever in the area!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. Attention to fine detail. Absolutely five star. The chef made sure to come out and check with diners."}
{"text":"food is good. waiter was super friendly. environment is nice. good place to go for a date. i used a groupon."}
{"text":"Great experience at Tigo Trattoria! We had a company event for 32 people and made the space work. 

To go over 3 mains things:
1) Venue: The place was very well visually balanced to have an nicely dim/lit area for everyone to have a great evening. The decor was subtle but fit the mood.
2) Food: Honestly was even better then what the review i read previously coming in. We have everything from Seafood, pasta, veal, salad, chicken, salmon, soup, and so much more and not one bad plate. Every plate was licked to the bone (not licked but nothing was left on the plate). We had individuals with Vegetarian or Gluten free or other allergies and the owner made sure to make everything perfect.
3) The owners: I was in discussion with Maurizio to set everything up and he made sure to please us in any way he could. The hidden thing I wasn't informed about was, Maurizio was the owner and the chef! Honestly blew my mind away since he came into the dinning room and made sure everything was good while still cooking up 96 plates of food (3 course meal for 32 people)

Overall, worth the price. Its not cheap but great place to go out for dinner. The portions were very well maintained.

Hope this review does you well and i'll be going back again on my next hot date... myself and my stomach! :D"}
{"text":"First time visitors (on Valentine's Day!) and have to say we were incredibly impressed! Keep reading! 

I decided to find a nice little Italian place that was cozy and somewhat romantic for Valentine's Day.  It was time we started to get out of our comfort zone and stopped going to the same places that we love every year.  This was a bit of a risk but based on the reviews online and photos, we decided to make a reservation (easily on open table) 

The place is definitely on the smaller size.  First impressions were that it was nicely lit for dinner and clean.   We requested a booth when reserving but there were only tables.  Totally fine.  

The staff from start to finish were all nice, helpful and pleasant.  

You get a nice plate of seasoned bread to start off your meal which is always a welcomed addition to any meal.  

Our appetizer calamari was perfect.  Not over battered or greasy at all.   

My agnolotti (stuffed with crab meat) in a cream sauce was rich and delicious.  We also had the potato gnocchi.  Both were fresh and plentiful.  Gnocchis were good but I wouldn't say best we've ever had. 

We finished the dinner with the homemade tiramisu.  Delicious.  Again not the best but tasty nonetheless.   

Thanks for a wonderful evening! See you guys again soon!"}
