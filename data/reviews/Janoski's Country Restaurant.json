{"text":"Growing up, this was our green grocer. At the time they had one building but always had the best produce. Now, the place has grown in size and what they offer but the quality is still as high as it was when I was young. The selection of fruits, vegetables, local treats, plants, wine and more is excellent.

The restaurant is a local favorite. While the food is good its not something you would give 5 stars to."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this was my 2nd trip to this little country restaurant. I had a huge breakfast first visit and it was good. Having said that, how difficult can it be to cook bacon sausage eggs and ham. So I can't give them a pass on the almost inedible dinner I just got. Talk about land of the bland omg it was disgusting. The country fried steak was like shoe leather and that's an insult to shoes everywhere. Lumpy unsalted un peppered un anything gravy. Lastly the dessert is what prompted a harsh review. I got an apple dumpling with no sugar no cinnamon and an uncooked naked apple. I'd rather eat cardboard. The peach pie wasn't much better. I'm sure this will be my last visit to bland land. Just a note to the owners, hire a chef or close after breakfast. Save the embarrassment."}
{"text":"They try to make it a \"country\" restaurant, but it's just a money maker for the Janoski family corporation. I dont think they really 'love' the restaurant business
Dont expect too much and its an OK place to go"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this farmer's market.  Their produce is great.  Always fresh, most items grown on their farm, incredibly reasonable prices for produce. They even carry some produce you don't see in the regular super markets.  100% he's my recommendation."}
{"text":"I love the products sold here very much. The plants in the spring and vegetables in the summer and fall. It's a beautiful place but I do not understand why the ladies that work here are so unfriendly, miserable, and down right rude! What is so wrong at this place that these women feel they can treat customers as though they are a burden to be there spending their hard earned money?"}
{"text":"Salads are awesome! Sometimes takes awhile to get seated."}
{"text":"Rude and nasty...
We stopped in 3 hours ahead of requested time to check availability and ensure they could service 18 people. They said they could accommodate us and we arrived on time (which was after the lunch rush hour) and the hostess said they were running behind all day. She told us that it would be another 15 minutes before we would be seated and once we ordered, it would be 45 minutes before food would be ready. We asked if we ordered appetizers, would that be ready sooner. She rudely responded with \"It will just be as long as takes them to get to the ticket.\" We thanked them, but politely let them know that we couldn't wait that amount of time, as we had several younger children. The hostess looked at us and said, \"After all of that you don't want the table?\"  Nope, she huffed as we were leaving. 
So you clearly were not prepared or apologetic for any mistakes you made, your lack of preparation,  or your lack of ability to handle a large party in an agreed upon time. Instead you were ridiculous and disrespectful. 
In that 45 minutes, we drove elsewhere, were seated with drinks and bread in front of us, at a nearby chain family restaurant."}
{"text":"During a quick lunch break from work, someone mentioned here so we thought we would try it out. Yummmmm...... If you like home cooked meals and fresh food, this is the place. Quaint little place inside with a big country charm to it. Did I mention that the food was great......and real mashed potatoes. Great place that we will be back to.......enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had a horrible experience here.
My husband ordered the meatball sub. It was like a fluff ball. The meatballs were all fillers and low on meat. He didn't  finish his sub.
I ordered a Ruben, and what I got seemed to be what a 2yr old put together. It only had about 3 thin slices of meat. If you ever had a Ruben you already know the problem this is and the disappointment I had. It also had a very uncomfortable feel. What seemed to  be the manager had a scowl on her face the whole time. When we decided to leave the waitress asked if we were taking the rest of our meal home. We kindly declined. The unpleasant  lady was at the register and had the nastiest attitude. Now every time my husband and I drive by we shudder...... NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"On April 24 at approximately 1pm we stopped by Janoski's market.  My wife loves the wine there and we make it our weekly trip there on our way to Robinson.  
We purchased a bottle of wine, and I found a John Deer baseball cap for my dad, a casual dress for my wife and some candy for my daughters.  There was a long line of customers checking out, and only one cashier.  We stood in line for nearly 15mins and when we went to check out, the older lady with white hair and glasses was checking us out.  I guess you have to purchase food separately from any other items in the store...
But there was just candy and it was suppose to be a dollar and she made a remark to me that was loud enough for everyone in line to also hear... \"You're doing credit for only .80 cents?\"  And tried to embarrass me and my wife.  First of all I travel for my work and rarely carry cash, so all I had were credit and debit cards.  And then when I went to purchase my dad's hat and my wife's dress she said again very loudly so everyone could hear...\"ummm there are signs all over the back of the store that say cash only\" 
Well first of all we had already paid for the wine with credit and I got a military discount because I'm a desert storm veteran, and I paid for the candy with credit.  
So not only did she embarrass me and my wife In front of several customers in their store, but other people who walked out behind us said that she acted very inappropriately.  I will make sure that I repost this on every social media that I can.  Her actions were very unprofessional and unacceptable in a retail type of setting and I hope that her attitude isn't a direct reflection of how they treat everyone there or run their business model on.  
I seriously doubt that I will ever shop there again, and hope that anyone else treated that way will also comment about their experience."}
{"text":"Avoid this place if it's busy. Seemed like a great idea to go here after some fall activities in the area. But the wait for a table was 25 minutes because a party of 5 adults and two children is seemingly a lot of work. When we first arrived I was tempted to try the breakfast buffet which is available till 1pm on Sat & Sun but alas, our long wait to get seated (we arrived at 12:40) afforded us a front row view of the break down as we were still waiting for a table. Once we were seated, the drinks came fast as did some small sandwiches for the little ones. During this time, 4 tables around us were also seated. And, all 4 tables around us placed orders and were served before us. But then, they only had 3 or 4 adults, not 5 adults with 2 children. We were served eventually (omelets & other easy breakfast dishes) and eventually left the restaurant around 2:25 PM. During our stay, we mentioned the wait time to the waitress, but all she could say was \"You're up next\" and the kitchen is short handed. Upon leaving, we mentioned this to the lady at the cash register and she seemed mostly indifferent and mumbled something about how they really can't handle crowds like this. The food was ok but the service and wait was unacceptable. The place is also showing signs of maintenance issues like the upside down soap dispenser in the mens room, screws sticking out of the wall around the doorway and small things like that. it looks like they just don't care. I would recommend you stay away from this place when they are busy. It's not worth the aggravation."}
{"text":"Carrie McVay -- 5 star This place is a Classic! The wooden red porch announces your arrival, as the colorful, sweetly fragrant flowers in the hanging baskets awaken your senses to bring you into the moment, far from the spinning treadmill of everyday life. 
And your snagged.. into the moment.. as the door that's always moving closes behind you. You can breathe in the now..The cozy decor and smell of food cooking warms and comforts you as...Someone Else is Cookin! Its hardy, tasty and its your time to relax and enjoy ,,, Yes, take it. Do it for you. 
The best part, its REAL country dining..your gonna love it!"}
{"text":"This place is getting harder and harder to stop at following a hike at Raccoon State Park.  Inconsistency of service...marked with disinterested and unfriendly servers, inconsistency of food quality... mashed potatoes that are out of this world or too watery, and of all things today, inconsistency of portion size! I always order the mashed potatoes with a dinner as they are homemade and delicious! After looking at my plate, which looked like a senior portion, it was the first time I did not need a takeout container :(
The dinner rolls are delicious! I had to ask my server for them as she forgot to bring them out.
This used to be one of my favorite places to stop after my frequent visits to Raccoon State Park. It's become that bad relationship you just can't quit: you know how great and happy you can be, but time after time you are met with disappointment.
Maybe I need to just break up with Janoski's Country Restaurant."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a bad review about a local business, but after eating here well over a dozen times I think it is warranted.

I always feel as if I'm a bother by eating at this establishment. The lady (one in particular) who always works the register is the most unfriendly person at the restaurant. Never a smile, always looks annoyed. She's what I assume to be a manger or should be at this point because she has been there since they first opened. As someone who has frequented this restaurant multiple times over the years, one would think seeing a familiar face would encourage a better attitude.

The waitstaff is friendly, I don't have any complaints in that department. 

The food. Mostly terrible. For having a large farmhouse I would expect some fresher produce. It's likely it comes from a can. As someone who frequents the farm market on a weekly basis, I know what I am getting on my plate is not the same as what I am buying across the street. That fact boggles my mind. Overpriced for what you are getting. Plastic plates? Come on. I was indicated that they had water issues at some point and that it was a temporary thing, 3 years later and still eating on plastic.

All and all, not impressed. I cringe when guests of mine suggest we go here. I would much rather go to ponderosa golf course, enjoy a good view and have a way more satisfying meal at a cheaper price. 

Step up your game, Janoskis."}
{"text":"This review is for the restaurant.  The food here is always good, and their dinner salad is the best you can get anywhere.  We always enjoy stopping here when traveling to Pittsburgh from Ohio.  
The farms prices are a bit high, we're used to less expensive produce out here.  But we'll always go to the restaurant.  Their fries are so very good as well."}
{"text":"Give me a \"J\"!

Coworkers and I visited this establishment and we really enjoyed our meals.   The meals are on the bland side (I will justify the 4 stars :)) because they do cater to many retirement communities I believe.

I recommend breakfast.   I have had the Big \"J\" breakfast several times.   3 Eggs, bacon, ham, sausage patty, home fries and toast for $5.50.    The ham is off the bone.  A very yummy meal.

I had the hot turkey sandwich platter - Sandwich covered with turkey gravy, mashed potatoes.  Large portions.  The mashed potatoes were not anything to write home about.  (Stick with the home fries).

Dessert - Pies and apple turnovers are very good.  I recommend the apple turnover.

Service - very attentive (even when they have bus loads of elderly come in)
Atmosphere - meh - uneven tables, mix of furniture.   Not really country except for the knick knacks
Food - Above average depending on what you get.  Breakfast - great, Lunch - okay - Dinner (never had) - they do offer a buffet on certain days.
Price - very good in my option
Location - close to their farm store which is pretty cool.   Check out their pastries, meats, veggies, and locally / regionally made items.   

Pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Expect lots of meat and potatoes. I liked the open faced meatloaf sandwich and mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Janoski's on Sunday while driving through Pennsylvania. Parking lot was almost full at noon. My husband and I had breakfast. Our server, Sami, was attentive, friendly and helpful. The restaurant itself is an older decor with antiques and Americana. The food came out quickly and was average breakfast fare. I loved that my toast was well-buttered since I always have to ask for extra butter at most restaurants. Would have liked potatoes to be cut in smaller pieces and crispier.  My husband loved that his country fried steak was hand breaded, not the frozen variety of some restaurants. If I  lived around here I would definitely come back. Would have loved to try the pie."}
{"text":"Greasy food.  Our waitress was nice.  The woman who answered the phone hung up on me; she was rude. You leave smelling like fried food.  I had the ham and cheese on rye.  The ham seemed fresh but the cheese was velvetta I'm pretty sure.  The fries were good but really greasy. Your water is served in a plastic disposable cup.  I had tea that was luke warm.  He had  bbq chicken sandwich which was literally store bought bottle of bbq sauce poured over a chicken breast; I can do better at home."}
{"text":"Well, I passed on the fresh veggies and had the reuben and fries.  It was good.  I like a greasy sandwich and french fries once in a while.  The waitress was doing a good job, despite what other patrons may have told her.  She kept apologizing to us for no reason, leading me to believe that many customers just complain there for nothing.  Please - it's not exactly like fine dining in there.  It's okay people, really, it's okay.  Relax.  You're in the country."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Employees just walk in front of you, or almost push you out of the way, and they have shedding dogs walking around the store. They put yellow tomatoes in quart sized baskets on display, then the cashier basically accused my family and I of stealing them, until she realized it was her mistake. Instead of apologizing, even after I told her I didn't want them, she charged me, and bagged them anyways. I spent about $50 there, but still got treated like a criminal, as if I wanted the $3 difference. Really?! Never apologized, never said a word, didn't even say \"have a good day\". NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Yesterday I met a Pittsburgh Meetup group at this restaurant for breakfast.  They were terrifically busy and we sat at picnic tables outside.  The restaurant did nothing to prepare for us.  It would have been advisable to set out pitchers of water and tableware ahead at very least.  We had a nice but poorly trained young girl do her best to take care of us but she had no support at all.  I tire of breakfast buffets being on the road as much as I am so I opted to order.  I really was excited to see what their food was like since they were so busy.  I ordered a mushroom and swiss omelet, potatoes and rye toast.  I liked the potatoes, not greasy, good flavor and well coooked.  The quality of the bread was really good but I like my toast toasted.  The omelet was sad.  One of those lame flat top omelets where you overcook the eggs.  This one was greasy and they filled it with canned mushrooms and threw a piece of swiss on top.  Worst of all, they are filling the landfill with hundreds of their plastic plates.
I told the manager on the way out that I thought we could have been taken better care of and she said she would speak to our waitress.  I told her it wasn't her fault and looked her in the eye.  Management doesn't know how to train their waitstaff and they don't know how to handle a party of 20.  I wouldn't go back for breakfast in any case.  
This restaurant is open for lunch and dinner.  I hope they break out the china for one of those."}
{"text":"large quantities of food well made. it does pull off the country family feel well. the place can get very busy on the weekends so expect a wait. its not the best breakfast I've had but ingredients are fresh and meats are very flavorful. I would defintly recommend and will be coming back. the only downsides are it's quite a drive to get here and the John deer motif can be a bit overwhelming"}
{"text":"Stop by there for breakfast a lot when we camp at Raccoon nearby. Simple fare done decently, with good portions.
Across the street, the actual produce store and market is a gem. Good fresh offerings, good selection and prices. Always buy some Brunten's milk...and walk upstairs to see some interesting things for sale. 
Worth the stop, at either place."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area recently  we have ordered from  this restaurant numerous times already. Very  friendly staff, welcoming atmosphere and wonderful pricing for the large portion. 
We have had 3 different servers and all were very pleasant."}
{"text":"Another restaurant, another stupid, clueless waitress.  Sat at the bar, ordered eggs, pancakes and sausage.  Took 40 minutes to come out and was cold.  Waitress did not understand telling her customers about the specials, or offering refills on coffee.  Sausage patties had clumps of congealed fat on top. Eggs were very good.  Why are the young people working in restaurants so God damn lazy?  It's a hard job, and you deserve a good tip if and I do mean if you actually do your job."}
{"text":"Stopped here with a large party for lunch.  The service was quick and cheerful and the portion sizes were large and everyone enjoyed their meals.  I got the cheeseburger.  It was at least a 1/3 pound patty and cooked/seasoned well.  It came with a generous helping of potato chips.
But at $7.25 I shouldn't have been charged an extra $0.75 for a slice of tomato on it.  One member had an Italian sub.  It cost $8.95 plus an additional 0.75 for hot pepper rings. Soft drink was $2.40, coffee was $1.95 (and I couldn't drink the second cup because the non-dairy creamer I put in it was growing something green in the middle.  She didn't offer to bring me another cup). A kid;s cup of milk was $2.25, a country salad (like a Chef's salad) was $9.95, and a kid's mac n cheese was $4.00.

So although it was good, I think it was a little pricey.  Especially the extra charges for tomato and hot pepper rings."}
{"text":"My food was decent /not great. Our waitress disappeared for long periods of time. The prices were extremely high. The decor is charming. We waited a looong time for our check. I would not go back. My parents felt the same way."}
