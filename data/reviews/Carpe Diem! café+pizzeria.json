{"text":"Came to this restaurant because I just moved to the area and read great reviews about their pizza.   It became apparent the moment I stepped into the door that this wasn't the same place I'd read about.  Same name and same interior but the focaccia sandwiches seem to have been replaced with shawarmas.  The pizza that I'd heard so much about was replaced with dull little slices that looked days old.  I ordered one because I was starving but won't make that mistake again.  I've literally never had a slice of pizza so bland and uninspired (and I've eaten pizza at highway truck-stops)."}
{"text":"New owners took over. The pizza is not the same at all. Their \"personal\" pizza is now comparable to a chain pizza, it has no character. On their thick crust pizzas, they've started replacing delicious italian ingredients with chain pizza ingredients: green peppers, and pepperoni instead of salumi. 

Ugh."}
{"text":"As others have written, the place has changed ownership, and no, the food is not as good.  The first clue was the appearance of green peppers -- perhaps the ultimate hack topping when it comes to preparing pizza.  They're attempting stromboli, which I initially found interesting, but unfortunately there's green peppers inside.  Many of the counterstaff remain, and they're still nice, but the blunt truth is that this is not the unique example it was before.  All my earlier gushing is almost completely invalid now.  I'll keep the review up as nostalgia, but please don't take it seriously.  It describes the past, not the present."}
{"text":"How do you buy an established pizza restaurant and F it up so bad? I used to get the thin crust \"personal\" sized pizzas from Giovanni (wild guess) and went in last week with a craving for one.
The new owners seem nice enough, though what I received was a humongous pizza that seems as though it had been made by Pizza Pizza or some other generic joint. I was totally disappointed and will not likely return and definitely won't unless they get some green olives!"}
{"text":"EDIT: This has been confirmed. The place is closing in two weeks from today (August 9, 2010). Oh what am I going to do!!!!
EDIT 2: False alarm, sort of. The place is being sold to different owners and the staff is staying. It won't be the same without its creator, though. But he promised to keep everyone updated on any of his future plans.

As far as lunch places go, this has to be my most favourite. Some of the most delicious pizza I've had in my life is made here daily. The owner is  very approachable and fun to deal with. I can't find grand enough words to describe this place as a whole, so I'll just list some of my favourite things, and you can pick some of them up and judge for yourself

* Pizza slices. These go for $3.49-3.99, and vary by day of week. The slice is about 6x6 inches on thicker crust, and is typically sufficient as  lunch. Some of my favourites are the Greek pizza on Mondays, topped with plenty of fresh feta cheese and herbs (this pizza is good enough a reason to get excited about Mondays, I swear); parmesana on Wednesdays; and the fantastic 4-cheese pizza on Fridays generously topped with blue cheese, among other things. 
* Sandwiches. Go for about $6.50 on average, and are very tasty. Most are packed in plastic Starbucks containers which made me think they're Amy's or something at first, but they're made on the premises, and the staff will gladly warm them up for you in the oven. 
* Focaccia bread. $2 per square slice. Fantastic bread drizzled with olive oil and salt. I like chewing on this stuff at 4pm when the stomach is growling.
* Coffee. Try his cappuccinos and espressos, especially the doubles. Mmm.

Most of the above disappears off the shelves by 2pm or so. The best time to come is between 11am and 1pm, when you're most likely to encounter fresh out of the oven slices. And they are so worth it.

Now, all his pizzas and sandwiches are made on top of this magical secret dough that is both chewy and soft, and is absolutely fantastic. I personally prefer thin crust, but this dough is so deliciously addictive I think I'll need to go to a pizza rehab soon. If you're curious, I asked the owner about it, and he proofs the dough overnight based on a sourdough starter, with additional proofing in the morning. I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS DOUGH!!!!!

Finally, someone I know asked someone I know who asked one of the people working there, and the place might be closing by the end of 2010 due to insufficient sales, so I highly suggest you come by there before it's (possibly) too late. This pizza isn't to be missed!"}
{"text":"Yay, thick crust!  This term doesn't really do it justice, though, 'cause it's actually a crispy/fluffy home-made focaccia crust.  Tasty!

The toppings are varied and of good quality.  The thick slices are on display, but they will also make a personal, thin-crust pizza.  (They will also make a thick crust, 6-slice rectangular pie, but they need 30-40 minutes notice.  That's my next move.

This is a small, comfortable, attractive cafe where you order from the counter and your food is brought to your table.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Just another gyro place now, they got rid of the gorgeous espresso bar and don't even sell coffee at all anymore. The pizza looks really terrible, worse than chain pizza, the offerings are not much different than the falafel place 3 stores to the right.

I'm really sad. :("}
