{"text":"I stopped in here on a wonderful sunny afternoon.  It's a cute little spot with a big chalkboard menu and some cute little tables. I ordered a limeade and a sandwich.   The person working was very gruff and didn't seem terribly pleased to serve me.  It was sort of odd 'cause it was a beautiful day, I waited patiently to order and said all the right things (please, thank you, etc.) and wasn't snarky or weird in my tone. The limeade was okay, but a lot of ice and what seemed like undissolved sugar in the bottom.  Frankly, the sandwich was bland.  The bread was unremarkable and the lovely fresh ingredients on it seemed sort of unexciting. It's too bad, because the other reviews are great.  My experience wasn't : ("}
{"text":"Love it.  Fantastic coffee (Lavazzo), a wonderful owner, chocolate cookies to die for, and a general cool ambiance.  Great for a rainy day."}
{"text":"On Saturdays they have this amazing croissant and egg special. The croissant is made in house and is perfect crisp on the outside and airy but chewy on the inside.  The eggs are fluffy and perfect..  Potato salad is also lovely.  It is pretty quiet on a Saturday too.  Staff is great. I keep coming back.  I wish they were open Sundays. ."}
{"text":"This place is next to my office.  I usually just get cookies or desserts here, but occasionally I get a sandwich or a special if it's raining or if I have to eat at my desk.  When I do this I used to get them to plate the sandwiches instead of using styrofoam packaging, and then I would return the plates clean.  Until last week.  When I went to pick up the sandwich, the server told me they wouldn't do this for me any more because People weren't returning the plates.  But that was one minute after my colleague had just walked out the door with his lunch plated.  When I called her on this she told me it was because I wasn't returning my plates - which is simply not true.  I know that many others in my office get lunch here, so perhaps one/some of them don't return their plates and bowls.  But I actually wash mine and return them so I took personal offense to this.  Then today I saw the owner of the business downstairs walking out with his lunch plated, so I decided to walk in to tell the server - who is a nice woman - that I did not appreciate what felt to me like a deliberately aimed punishment.  She said she would tell the owner how I felt.  Obviously she did, because today when I left my office he was closing up his shop at the same time and get this - he started scolding me right out on Queen Street!!  I told myself in the past I would stop going to this place because it was overpriced, or not very good (except for the baked goods), but I would always end up going back because of convenience.  But this time, I AM DONE FOR GOOD."}
{"text":"The food is OK. To be honest, I expected better based on the menu. I had a chicken, eggplant and goat cheese sandwich (#14; replaced goat cheese with swiss). It was average. I agree with the other reviewers that the bread is a bit stale and chewy. There was nothing special about the chicken or anything else on the sandwich. It came to $9, which was a bit much for what it was.   The decor is unique and cute; I liked it. The service was fast and friendly.   Overall, the food was just too pricey and too underwhelming. If I am in the area, I may come again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times whenever I have meetings with work colleague in the area.  Very reliable and fresh soups, salads and sandwiches. Friendly helpful and swift service. Kind of funky location and decor. Like it, tell people I like it and will be here again."}
{"text":"I initially came here because I was looking for an alternative to Starbucks, since I am no longer a fan of their teas. To my pleasant surprise, Cafe Bernate serves Organic Mighty Leaf tea. The first time I went the woman behind the cash was nice and even offered to steam my milk for me (did I pay for this? I hope not). I also got one of their freshly baked cookies. The second time I came I ordered the same tea but just received a plain black tea bag (looked like Tetley). When I mentioned that last time I got Mightly Leaf, I was told that they were out of it. Why was I not informed? I said that I come specifically for this tea because I am particular about my tea and asked for another flavour in Mighty Leaf. Not sure why this wasn't offered to me, since the Tetley wasn't Early Grey anyway, and they had plain black in Mighty Leaf. I also don't think that an organic and generic brand should cost the same. I felt like I received a little bit of attitude from the same woman who served me the first time. I also think small, customary apology should have been issued.  I have been back twice since. Once, for coffee. It was decent. Today, I came for lunch. I got a chicken/avocado/brie sandwich. It was alright. I think that for $9 it should have come with some veggies or coleslaw or something. I also got their Carrot/Ricotta soup which was exquisite. I also tasted their Leek & Potato soup, which was also very good. I definitely recommend the soups. The male serving me today was fine, but I still sense an underlying hint of snottiness (nothing major, but palatable to me, nonetheless). I would still return."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Toronto I was looking for a light and quick lunch and after a short stroll down Queen Street W I ran into Cafe Bernate. A lucky encounter, if I do say so myself.  The spot is a cute, cherry little cafe and while I took my food to go it seemed like it would be nice enough to eat there. They offer a few different soups, salads, and sandwiches and I ordered a simple house salad which was only $5 for a small. The \"small\" by the way is a misnomer as this salad was quite big. It was also really beautiful - full of lots of brightly coloured and delicious veggies, fruit, nuts and seeds and served with a side of bread.  I was in and out of there very quickly and thoroughly enjoyed my food. I'd definitely visit again for lunch when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I would never patronize this business, ever. I was just about to lock up my bike out front but the door had a \"closed\" sign clearly visible even though there were customers inside and on the patio. I went in to ask the guy behind the counter if they were open, at first he didn't even look up, when he finally did, he was so rude and so surly and argumentative,  and really angry that I asked him a question, even though I told him that the \"closed\" sign was hanging outside, forget it, I walked out and will never go in again.   You know, this is a small business competing with the Starbucks at the end of the block, if someone in Starbucks spoke to me like that, I would call their head office and complain. What kind of foolish business owner is rude to potential good, loyal customers? If it was the last coffee shop in Toronto, I wouldn't step foot in there ever again."}
{"text":"We recently stopped here for lunch while doing Contact. Basically serves soups, salads and sandwiches. I had a side salad and sandwich. Nothing out if the ordinary but found the bread, a baguette, to be on the stale side. It was way more chewy than I would have liked.   Overall a clean establishment with fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Nothing too revolutionary about the sandwiches but the service is quick and I'd rather go here than the Tim Hortons/Starbucks nearby. Had the avocado, brie, chicken sandwich and the chicken was rather bland but I don't think they're really going for bold flavours on a sandwich like that."}
{"text":"I love making new discoveries in familiar neighbourhoods. Had lunch at Cafe Bernate after a friend recommended it. Looks very unassuming from the outside, but as Marie F. mentioned, there is a large seating area (and in the summer, patio) in the back and there is a vast menu of 30 different sandwiches!   The atmosphere is casual and cozy, with rotating art on display, accommodating and warm staff, and spacious seating (also would be a good place to read a book or get some work done). I went on a weekday and it was busy, with lots of CAMH staff (CAMH is just across the street), art students (some from Max the Mutt animation school, next door), and such.   I had the #21 sandwich: spinach, mushroom, avocado, and provolone melt on a baguette. Divine. Our waitress said that was the most popular veggie sandwich. My friend had the same thing, but they let her substitute roasted red peppers for the mushrooms. I added a premium salad for $4 and I thought it was worth it. It was a pretty big salad, with nice fresh toppings. I had the \"Verde\" which has asparagus, brie, and avocado.  (I believe there are 2 things that make *everything* taste better -- cheese & avocado). My friend had the soup of the day - spicy pumpkin soup, and raved about it afterward.  Too bad we were too full, because at the front they had trays of freshly baked cookies and pastries fresh from the oven that looked and smelled amazing. Next time."}
{"text":"Came here for an afternoon snack.  It was almost 5pm but the owner was very welcoming and told us to feel free to stay as long as we wanted since he had lots of cleaning to do anyway.  I ordered the avocado, asparagus, provolone and tomato sandwich and the hubby got chicken, swiss and tomato.  The sandwiches were alright...nothing too mind-blowing.  They taste exactly like what's in them.  I liked that my sandwich was toasted and the cheese all melty.  It was light but did the job.  I'd like to point out that even though they were practically closed, the ingredients still tasted fresh and not just thrown together.  Regular sandwich - $6.95 Large - $8.95  I'm not too sure of the sizes.  Small place but nice."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: One of my go-to lunch spots when I want something light, refreshing and fast.  (3.5 STARS)  I frequent Cafe Bernate regularly and it never disappoints. In the summer, their back patio provides a quiet space away from the traffic of Queen West.   I usually get their combo which rotates a random sandwich with their soup of the day or a salad. Their sandwich offerings are so extensive that I don't think I've ever had the same thing twice! Most recently, I had their curried chicken in a mayo base with apples and pears and wrapped in a whole wheat pita. This has become my favourite sandwich they have now!  The soups are good but they ain't Ravi soups that's for sure! I know, unfair comparison, but when Ravi's is just down the street, it's hard not to. Once they got really creative with a yogurt-based blueberry soup, but it ended up being more like a porridge.  And finally, their freshly baked chocolate chip cookies are a perfect dessert or snack to go with lunch or coffee. Always a good pick-me-upper for a dollar."}
{"text":"A very quaint cafe shop i heard known for its delish sandwiches and fresh coffees. it's one of those places that is easy to miss when walking by a very busy queen street. A nice and quiet atmosphere good to just hang out and enjoy the very detailed art work surronding you. check on the front bar area and notice the cool stuff embeded into the counter. Also noticed the tray of fresh baked goods on the counter which looked very appealing. prices might seem bit high but then again it is queen street.    def come back for the sandwiches and some quiet time"}
{"text":"What's up with restaurants in the Queen and Ossington strip closing at 3pm and opening at 6pm?! I mean seriously people, it's 3:30pm on a Friday and I am hungry! Their loss is my win I guess because as a result of this most distasteful realization I stumbled upon Café Bernate.  The place looks small at first glance, but don't worry, there is a huge back room area with plenty of seating and even a little fenced in garage door area. The decor is simple. small circular tables in the font with a large concrete \"mosaic\" slab counter which features keys, buttons and other odd found objects. The back has more of a backyard jungle meets 70's cafeteria, with larger pastel blue tables and bright orange waffle plastic chairs.  Trying to select which sandwich to order proved to be challenging with so many yummy options. I ended up ordering #20, the Chicken, artichokes, spinach, and brie melt on an Italian baguette with a Red & White side salad. The salad was good, but not worth the extra $4. My sandwich was perfection, with melted brie oozing from every corner,  I had to take  moment of silence to honour the divine piece of cheese that was about to sacrifice itself for my appetite.  I ended my meal with a cookie and latte, which were both perfection. I will definitely be back to try more."}
