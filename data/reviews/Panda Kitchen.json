{"text":"Driving through here on a road trip with my friends and I was dying for some great Chinese. Luckily, we found PANDA KITCHEN. The place was warm and neat. I was greeted with a smile from the cute girl who works here. Overall, Nice food, nice weather and nice day."}
{"text":"Food was great, but little to no decor. Everything was very fresh-so much so that my 2 item order took 15 min to prepare. A great option for call-ahead carryout."}
{"text":"Very prompt service. Very nice, courteous staff. The Singapore mei fun noodles and garlic shrimp are superb. Just OK Thai menu, but not bad."}
{"text":"It's a little below-average as far as typical Chinese takeout goes.  Food was pretty so-so.  I didn't feel compelled to have my leftovers, which is unusual.  

I liked Hop Hing (up the street by Chipotle) much better."}
{"text":"Watched a gentleman return a bag of food while I was waiting to pick up my order. The male worker took the bag of food to the back where the female opened the bag, took something out, then staple the bag closed, whereupon the male worker promptly brought the same bag of food out waiting for pickup. DO NOT EAT HERE. I canceled my order and walked out never to return again."}
{"text":"We've been eating Chinese from this place since we moved to Medina in 2014. We have never waited longer than 15 minutes for any order regardless of amount. I have tones that everything is usually really good, of course I tend to always order the same 5 things.

Getting out of the parking lot can be iffy during high traffic commuting times and especially forget about turning left to get out! On the plus side, the crab rangoon is awesome!"}
{"text":"The food here is good but some items like boneless spare ribs have been too salty.  Overall experience has been good."}
{"text":"Sweet staff with great service. Good food. Prompt pickup service. Super clean kitchen."}
{"text":"I love this place. tried it on a whim and have been back at least 6 times since. Their won ton soup is so good! Only thing I would maybe change is if they would add a little \"more\" to the fried rice you get with a meal. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Panda is your standard Chinese take-out place.  Decent food and good portions, but nothing to write home about.  You can dine in, and they will actually serve you on nice dishes, which is a fun touch.

The low prices and copious amounts of food make for a pretty cost-effective lunch."}
{"text":"This was place was about as standard as you can get when it comes to Chinese take-out. Nothing amazing but not horrible. 

Crab Rangoons (aka Crab Puffs) were a little on the stale end. The crisp part of the wonton was not crispy and I could tell these were made earlier in the day. But to be perfectly fair I did place the order at 9pm (they close at 10).  8 pieces/$3.95.

The Chicken Lo Mein was decent. There was a good amount of veggies and the noodles were not mush. I would have preferred white meat but for $4.25 that could be asking too much. 

My order of General Tso's Chicken ($9.15) was over-sauced and severely over breaded. The broccoli could have been cooked another minute or two. While there was way too much, the sauce was tasty with a good amount of heat.

Overall, I appreciate that the food was ready on time, reasonably priced for the portions, and came in aluminum takeout containers (kept the food hot during our 20-minute ride home). I am giving 3 stars instead of 2 because of the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"When we get Chinese, we get it from here.  I tried a couple other places in Medina, but this one is my favorite (for cheap Chinese take-out).  Anything else costs more money."}
