The portion size is bigger than Holy Chuck. The burgers are tasty and juicy.
But they tend to overcook the fries."}
{"text":"Really good burger, fresh, no extra charge for a variety of toppings (including delicious sautéed mushrooms).

Took a bit long to be my order (20-25minutes) but worth it.

Amazing fries but a bit too much salt."}
{"text":"Ordered the spicy chicken burger combo today.

I like that you can choose all the toppings to go on your burger.
The burger was probably the best tasting chicken burger I've ever had in my life.
Fries were pretty good as well.
The spicy chicken burger wasn't spicy at all, though.

My only complaint: I was charged an extra $1 for the added cheese. It's a slight disappointment because the cheese was just one of those cheap, thin, orange square slices. 

Burger was amazing so it wasn't a big deal.
Total for my meal was $13 and change."}
{"text":"I would give a 4.5 if I could.
Been here for more than 10 times. It was a go to burger joint in first year uni, and now that I work near the place, I have an excuse of going there hehe.

Hands down best burger place for taste consistency I've been to. And I've been to a lot of burger joints. Juicy, just the right size, the buns aren't soggy, and there's free toppings! I always like the crispy onions, caramelized onions, ketchup, and jalapeño peppers. 

Price is ~6$, pretty good deal. The poutine here is good too. 
Only thing is service, they aren't too friendly, but I usually get it to go so alls good."}
{"text":"Very happy to see a new burger place open up. 

Used to be a Hero burger customer, but Slab burger has won me over! (Hero fries are slightly better, more crispy...) 

Slab burgers are very similar to Five Guys Burgers in the States. Thin, smashed patty, sesame seed bun, unlimited toppings. I always get the single cheeseburger, my boo gets the double cheeseburger with bacon and we share fries. Slab's better at the burger/bun/toppings ratio than the comparable Hero Burger down the street. 

Hope it sticks around long enough for me to try the onion rings and poutine!"}
{"text":"Love the idea of free toppings to your hearts content. Veggie burger was store bought crap. Regular burger was okay. Doesn't blow your mind though in any sort of way. Kind of like A&W nothing more. Wouldn't make special plans to eat here"}
{"text":"More like FAB Burgers! 

No, not really. It's just ok. The free topping are pretty great."}
{"text":"Went here because of the reviews.  Cons first: They messed up my order and gave me fries when I wanted onion rings.  They than tried to cover it up by saying that their fries are really good.  In truth, they lacked flavor and lacked the crispness of a good fry.  Luke warm Pro:  the burgers were okay.  Nothing really to them.  They tasted like any generic burger joint.  I'd put them up against (at best) Johnny's or Five guys but at worst they're probably as good as Harveys.  All in all they're definitely not worth the price and aren't anywhere in the same league as Holy Chuck's or the burgers priest."}
{"text":"First time that I've ordered from Slab Burgers.  I ordered the double burger with cheese and bacon.  Holy cow!  Talk about a ton of bacon.  I actually removed 3 strips of the bacon - too much bacon for me.  All in all, the burger was great and the fries are pretty good too.  Didn't even put ketchup on them.  Will probably order again, but next time, no bacon and more cheese.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I miss this place but it takes about 10 minutes walk for me to get to this place, I am pretty lazy so it's been a while since my last visit. 

There are hero burgers everywhere but I like this place much better.

Yeah, the cashier girl doesn't seem to be very friendly, but I don't really care since I always pay and make my burgers to-go, simple as that.

I like the fact that you get free mushrooms here while I have to pay 99 cent extra for hero burgers. Also, the sauce and meat taste so much better here than hero burgers makes me less willing to pay more for hero burgers. Hero burgers are so dry and tasteless while slab burger has a more juicy and smoky taste.

I guess they do have a lot of space to improve on though, like teaching the girl to be more happy about her life. Well we can't really teach her that, she probably is not so happy about making minimum wage, guess someone has to live with that. :)"}
{"text":"I give this place the 5* b/c unlike almost all the other popular new skool burger joints in town this one has a  solid portion size! I buy the double cheese burger for $10 incl tax and it's filling on its own. No need for fries! Everyone I've brought here has enjoyed it. Don't forget the hot pepper relish it makes a great burger absolutely excellent!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place as I fancied a burger.

Quick service, pretty tasty burger and sweet potato fries. I got the double patty and the price was okay, however I would go back."}
{"text":"Upon entering this small burger place, I felt a bit overwhelmed by the bright lit menu above the counter.  It was definitely a whoa moment, but that disappeared quickly as we were greeted by the friendly staff member behind the counter who welcomed us warmly and was ready to take our order.

The fact that  I was hungry, it only took me a little while to decide on ordering the double slab burger with bacon and cheese combo that included fries and a drink for $12.79.  Any lunch under $15  always good for me. 

The best part of this place was the abundance of free toppings I was able to choose from for a burger my way.  The burger was absolutely delicious since I selected my own toppings which blended nicely together.  The burger was meaty, tasty and full of flavour that I enjoyed every bite.  The fries on the overhand wasn't as great.  It could use a bit more crispness,  plus no amount of ketchup helped with the taste.  Perhaps next time I'll upgrade for the onion rings.

I will definitely be back to try another burger my way."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at how highly some people have rated this place. I found it greasy to the point of being unpleasant. They don't offer a lot of healthy toppings / vegetables for the burgers either, and the cheese they use is fake American cheese. The sweet potato fries were overcooked and tasted burnt. I ended up throwing out most of my meal. The portions were good and I'm sure they mean well. Maybe it was just a bad day, but I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"When you go, make sure you still have your sunglasses on, because the bright freaking lime green walls will get ya every time. 

Pretty tasty little burger bar. When you walk in the door, you'll be greeted by a large menu behind the counter with different burger options. They have Small and Regular sized burgers, options on cheese and bacon for a few extra dollars, then a whole wack of free toppings and sauces and things. Load me up, baby! I should mention that the small one was big enough to be a regular burger for people with regular levels of hunger. The \"regular\" sized one was sizeable, and boyfriend could scarcely finish it. For sides, they had the standard options - Fries, salad, poutine. The poutine was pretty good. Cheese curds + gravy on well-done fries. Definite +10 points for using cheese curds. Also, if beef isnt your thing, they had a few options in chicken and veggie burgers, though I can not speak to their awesomeness. I must admit, my one disappointment with their menu was the absence of onion rings. Not being a huge fan of french fries, I like to substitute for those crispy delicious creations.. But alas. Not today. :(

 The burgers are made there, rather than nasty frozen ones a la fast food chain. To that end, its not that fast. Expect to wait 5-10 minutes for your burger to be cooked and prepared.  While you wait, enjoy the soothing melodies that Virgin Radio has to offer, and browse The Onion's print edition. 

A decent option, if burgers are your thing and you dont mind the lack of ambiance. Food is on par with the GBC down the street, but less $$ and less pretence."}
{"text":"Their burger is really tasty. Although it's a little pricier. But the quality is really good.  They make everything fresh. It's better u call them to order first and pick up after 10min."}
{"text":"This place makes really good burgers, but if you eat it there you will 100% smell like grease and burgers afterward"}
{"text":"The burger wasn't the best and wasn't the worst. It's perfectly decent. I'd eat it again for sure. Their prices are a little high though, especially when you make it a combo. Upgrading from regular fries to poutine like my friend did and you're pushing the $20 mark. As for the actual joint, it's a little dingy. And they really need to figure out some proper ventilation. Outside it smells like a good burger, but inside it smells like grease. I can still smell it on my clothes after eating there several hours ago. Get it to go, or order through one of the delivery apps."}
{"text":"My favourite burger in Toronto. Bigger and better than the Priest. No pretense like the Harbord Room and it's ilk. Just a huge sloppy delicious burger. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this place out.  And got exactly what I was expecting, complete and utter blah.

I have been walking by this place, which is run by a nice chinese family, everyday on my way to work and it always made me chuckle.  It used to be a grilled cheese place (which was alright/blah) for about 2 weeks but the last I heard they got a conditional pass and then voila Slab Burger appeared, run by the same people.

The funny thing about this place is that they often are closed, with brown paper draped over the windows with a have a hand written sign in the window saying saying \"we ran out of beef\" or \"too many people bought our deal and we have no beef\".  It also appears to be open at random times, eg: some sundays it is closed all day while on other week nights it appears to be open abnormally late.

When I finally sat down to eat the famous Slab burger there was really nothing that separated it from heating up a frozen burger myself.  This was quite out of line with the most recent review, perhaps Jenika is actually just one of the owners?"}
{"text":"Ordered a classic single burger. One good perk of this place is that every burger includes the option to add several free condiments and toppings (including carmelized onions and mushrooms to name a few). However, it took close to 15 minutes for my burger to be prepared despite there only being 3 small orders ahead of me. The burger was just alright, nothing to gloat about. The establishment has no A/C so I recommend to take out on a very hot and humid day."}
{"text":"Best burger joint in town, topping variety is great and most toppings are included in costs. Fries are borderline burnt, but I like my fries crispy so suits me well. Definitely recommend this place if your craving a good burger and are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"It was good. Not amazing, but good. I had the triple bacon cheeseburger. I like the feeling of the calorie-infused artery clogging burger just as much as everyone else. This was THE ONE. I liked it. However, the only thing it lacks is flavoring in the actual meat. I understand it is just a burger, but it isn't spectacular and I feel like they have the potential to be it. Also, the onion rings definitely taste better than the fries."}
{"text":"Hands down best burger in Toronto. Need to work on ventilation though: I'd never have walked in due to the smell. Only reason, I entered was because of a phenomenal review from a friend. Aside from this, an outstanding quality burger."}
{"text":"Burgers are made to order, lots of toppings and unlimited refills on pop.

Standard combo came out to $10.72 after taxes.

Fries were great too, Can add .69 cents more for onion rings instead."}
{"text":"Decent burger place right near our apt. Burgers are big, juicy and quite nice. I had the chili burger with a side of onion rings. Pretty non objectionable and was served fairly quick."}
{"text":"It seems Slab got it together with the few minor complaints i had. Their gravy has gone from bland to delicious, and their bacon is now much thicker. I don't know if i caught them on an off day, or if they actually took my suggestions into consideration but i'm a big fan of this place now, really tasty burgers, fried just the way i like them."}
{"text":"Really really delicious and good burgers. Fresh. Free toppings! Reasonably priced. Only complaint is that the French fries were ridiculously greasy/oily. I know that fries are supposed to be greasy but these were extremely. Other than that, it's all good!"}
{"text":"I totally picked this place randomly while walking along Charles St. W. and was surprised. The burger took a little while to make, about 10 minutes or so and that was at 2pm, so slow time. It was worth it though. I thoroughly enjoyed the burger. Fresh and well cooked with perhaps a little more grease than some would prefer. Price was good for a meal with drinks and fries. 
The service was descent. Nothing to brag about but nothing awful either. 
I have to admit the seating area isn't the greatest neither is the ambiance. It could use a serious renovation. Not that it's old and gross but just isn't the most pleasant setup I have ever seen. 
In closing. Good burger at a good price. Will probably go back."}
{"text":"+ The burger held together just enough, while still coming apart in my hands/mouth in a satisfying way. Greasy in a satisfying way, not a mess - though you'll want a few napkins for sure. I got a double because I'm a big-ish guy, but in the end I think a single with fries or onion rings would have been enough - these are thick, real ground beef patties you get here.

Definitely felt I got my money's worth in both quantity and quality, except maybe the cheese (see below). Kinda wish I'd gone for a refillable fountain drink cup instead of a glass bottle of coke, but that's on me!

Very filling, and I like that it's not far from many other great places - my girlfriend and I hit them up after raiding Bay Street Video, then took a short walk to ABC Books, followed by 401 Games on Yonge street. Definitely a good location, geographically speaking, and also good in that we had no trouble hearing each other speak thanks to a lack of loud music of televisions.

+\- Fries were...present, edible.

- Not much of a sit-down place due to it being kinda tiny; I wouldn't bring more than one other person with me on a visit. Processed cheese slices instead of real cheese felt a little cheap.

Overall: Not bad! I'd happily stumble in there when hit by sudden hunger again, as we did, but I don't know as I'd make specific plans to go in the future."}
{"text":"It's an interesting little burger place--not quite fast food yet not quite gourmet. Great sesame-coated bun. Juicy meat. Superb crispy and nicely-browned fries. Generous portions for very reasonable prices. Will definitely make a point to return."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. There was a small line but the food came out really quickly.

I ordered the double slab which had two good size patties with my choice of toppings. I was both full and satisfied with the burger. The burger came to $10 in total without  any sides.

It's great to see that the place offers lots of free toppings compared to other burger joints. It had toppings lime jalapeño, mushrooms, and hot relish which would often be classified as premium toppings at other burger joints. 

Will come back here for lunch :)"}
{"text":"We ordered this through Just Eat - (a first) and it came in lighting speed which was great because all we wanted were fast burgers for a lazy day. 

I ordered the standard bacon cheeseburger with crispy onions (a great no cost option) with the hot pepper relish (which was very hot and a bit overpowering) next time i'll get it on the side. The burger was delicious and satisfying - not your over the top crazy burger and wasn't huge either which was nice (you can upgrade the amount of patties etc - but not really necessary portions are too big in this world these days).

The onion rings were perfect - the fries were cooked great but they were all tiny pieces like bottom of the fry bag stuff.

All in all great options and quick service would definitely order again."}
{"text":"This place is what dreams are made of.

I ordered the Monster with two patties, which is two patties sandwiched by two grilled cheese sandwiches. All the toppings are free and you are allowed to put whatever you want on the burgers. My boyfriend ordered the triple xxx burger that comes with three patties and he enjoyed it tremendously. 

We got the burgers to go as we live quite close to the place, but there is also seating (though limited) in the restaurant. 

I would definitely come back again, this place has amazing burgers with humongous portions for the price."}
{"text":"It was good filling burger but for a double patty burger you expect alot but this was just two 4 oz paty for a burger that is 10 buck... yeah I cant say I think price is on point but here what i got.

The burger itself wasn't bad just maybe cooked too long it was almost charred, didn't really have any juice but it was alright. I has onion rings with my meal which I did like.

So all and all it was good but not stellar. Price felt a bit much, burger wasn't bad but it didn't stand out as anything amazing"}
{"text":"Great burgers. Always juicy and tasty. Sometimes take a while, but worth the wait.  +++ Great prices as well."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through JustEat. Simply outstanding poutine! I also had a burger and it came with so many options of free toppings. Simple. Fresh. Definitely worth it. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This place has long been on my list of burger joints to try.  As I was walking along Bloor street, I decided to try this place out for lunch.  I ordered the American Single Bacon burger combo and it came to just under $12 including tax.   Pretty decent price.  

How was the food you ask? Burger was fresh, meat was decent, but not outstanding.  I would equate it to Harvey's/Hero Burger hybrid.  As for the fries, while they were freshly cut, I found them to be too dry and overcooked.

Verdict: Meh, but decent if you are in a jam and don't know what to eat."}
{"text":"I had little hope for the food here today but my stomach steered me right into the door of Slab Burger regardless.

I attempted not to hold any biases going here as I had a prior visit at the same location when it was known as Bbreakfasts which I was not wild about (see my other reviews).  

Looks like the same owners who rebranded the restaurant and focused on different offerings.  Goodbye breakfasts, hello delicious burgers!

Order:

1 4 oz cheeseburger combo (sub for a poutine instead of fries)
1 8oz bacon slab burger combo
$24 including tax

If the food wasn't so scrumptious I would have said I overpaid.  However it was worth the real beef patty inside and the size.  The sesame hamburger bun was also fresh and perfectly toasted.  Soft inside but toasty (not flaky or blackened) on the outside.  Generous with the free ingredients.

The fries and poutine were also done well.  They are a bit thicker than shoestring but less than say a McCain's superfry.  My perfect size.  And there is skin on it so you know its from a whole potato.  The gravy I expected to be super salty for the dark tone it was but it was just perfect.  Still, probably from a mix.  Could have had more curds on it.  

Their menu is simple but still has the perfect number of items on it without it being confusing.  I agree with other posters that they should offer onion rings.  

Lots of room available to sit.  I like that it is totally no frills but still bright and cheery.

Hope their food quality, portion sizes and prices stay the same."}
{"text":"I've been eating a lot of lettuce for lunch lately and decided a little greasy protein would help it go down easier. I'd been eyeing Slab Burger and decided to try it out. I ordered a single burger with cheese, no bun. There was a little confusion in placing my order but the girl taking my order was pretty awesome and straightened it up efficiently. The food took about four minutes to receive, not bad considering it was the tail end of lunch time. The burger was very tasty. It was advertised as medium well and it was indeed served medium well. The price is the thing killing me. The thickness, flavour, and fresh not frozen angle are all identical to Wendy's only more expensive. It's a real thinn patty and the cheese is processed. The price point should be more around $4 rather than the $6.50 I was charged. I'll probably still go back because it's better than McDonalds and closer than Wendy's."}
{"text":"Beef poutine is sooo good. Basically comes with an entire beef patty on top for about $8.50. Interior of the shop is no fuss. There are 8 small tables for dine in. We ordered a burger and beef poutine - waited about 10 minutes for the order to be ready. Overall great fast food option in the area!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in Toronto so far. The burgers are cooked well done, but they are still juicy.  Excellent sear on the meat. I'm not sure if it was an accident or not, but the crusted chesse was really good.

Ordering seems similar to Five Guys, where you can put whatever you want on the burger."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to hit Slab Burgers before a movie at the Varsity, and I'd already tried it a couple of times before and enjoyed it, so I was hoping for a similar experience.

The first thing we noticed is that the space has gotten smaller since our last visit last year. The place was empty, so perhaps this is a money-saving tactic. Anyway, I ordered a single burger with cheese and a pretty wide selection of toppings, while my friend ordered a combo.

We took a seat and waited. And waited. Even though we were the only customers, it took about 10 minutes for the food to arrive. When it finally did come, the fries were piping hot but the burgers were room temperature (at best). I'm not sure how long the burgers were just sitting there waiting for the fries to be ready, but the cook should, at this point, have a better system for ensuring everything arrives at hot.

The barely-warm patty was fine, if unspectacular. There was an attempt at a crust but it had either been made soggy by the toppings or it just wasn't cooked enough. The end result was an edible but far-from-memorable burger. And given that it cost me around $8, I was certainly a little disappointed. The fries were amazing, though.

I'll give the place another chance sometime, but I'm not in a rush."}
{"text":"For what's in the area, this place is probably my favourite for burgers. 

I usually order a single burger with the usual toppings (ketchup, mustard, mayo, lettuce, onions and tomatoes), comes up to around $11.  You can tell that the meat is a fresh ground beef patty and made when ordered. You can taste the ground beef and isn't as oily as Big Smokes.I really like their fries, they remind me of food truck fries and they're always hot and fresh. I've yet to try their poutine cause a burger and fries is usually enough for me for lunch. Don't want to go back to work and get itis lol 
The service is great, don't know her name but there's always a warm, welcoming lady that's always at cash. I usually come here once every month or two for lunch and they always get my order right.
Menu is big and clear to understand. Great variety of toppings to add to your burger.
Only Con about this place are that the seating is quite limited and they have poor ventilation. When near or entering the place, you can smell the thick grease in the air. I always find that my clothes smell like Slabs when I leave.

My only advice is to look up their menu online and call ahead if you're in a rush because the burgers are made when the order is placed."}
{"text":"Good burger! Not too sure about the toasted bun...The fries are little too greasy for my taste"}
{"text":"Stopped here by chance today after visiting the ROM and looking for a place to snack.  This place really exceeds the premium burger chains by a longshot.  The prices are much closer to regular fast food places on the one hand, and the quality is much better on the other.  Fries are truly excellent.  Salad was good and was made with romaine and not iceberg.  The burgers are tender, juicy and a bit sloppy - what a burger should be.  Buns were sesame coated, large and very tasty.  Free toppings included a good variety of choices.

One should note that this is a tiny place - not much seating."}
{"text":"just a damn solid burger.  toasted-ish sesame bun, very lightly-seasoned beef patty (i'm okay with this, others might not be), and you can fire at will with the topping and sauce options.  the single patty burger ran me $6.64 tax included, which i think is very reasonable for the size and quality of food you get.  pretty expansive menu too, so i'd have reason to come back here again"}
{"text":"SO GOOD!

I walk pass it daily and have always avoided going in there because you can smell the grease from outside! I think their ventilation system is just not good enough for their awesome patties and fries.

Having been to five guys before, both the menu and the fries reminded me of the popular downtown joint.

The buns and cheese were perfectly toasted and melted, mmmm, just how I like them. The fries are extremely tender (if you like your fries crispy then don't get them here, opt for the new yorker deli instead). 

Comparing to its close neighbour, gourmet burger, the patties tasted much better. Something about gourmet burger's patties just puts me off. 

A small burger have one patty, and a \"regular\" burger have two.
Don't be like me and ask the stupid question: \"um how small is you small burger? Is it a half of a regular burger?\" 

A small burger combo came just shy of $10 dollars, no drinks included though."}
{"text":"I've been totally spoiled from gourmet burger shacks in Toronto, but I didn't realize the extent of this until I ordered food from Slab Burgers. I've been here a few times and tried out their menu, which consists of burgers (+an abundance of free toppings), drinks and sides. Waiting time for their food is around ~10 minutes, and it's much better if you bring it home to eat.

Their patties are incredibly... black? The meat is charred and a little dry. It's better if you pile on the toppings to mask the taste, but if you pick onions bear in mind they are raw, not cooked. I tried their black bean burger- a dry, unappetizing affair- with their whole wheat bun. The poutine contains floppy fries that are a tad tasteless, which is the direct opposite of the crispy and salty fries I love. 

In the future I will use the website orderit so that I don't have to sit around and wait for the chefs to finish cooking, and will not order any of their vegetarian burgers. Perhaps their other sides will taste better as well? It's a very average burger place for when you need a quick food fix."}
{"text":"Great service and fantastic burger and fries. Fresh everday...Total experience is important so point deducted because bathroom needs serious fixing."}
{"text":"We normal only go to 4 star rating, but we decided to take a chance with them at 3 stars. It was awesome very tasty and fresh food. The hamburg to me was better than Five Guys, Seriously, and the Poutine was amazing and we are from Quebec home of the Poutine. 
Good job guys."}
{"text":"Just ate a chan cobb wrap. Way better than I expected! (For some reason I expected it to be meh I guess.) Big portion and some interesting fillings including corn, black beans, edamame, and crumbled tortilla chips. Decent value too at around $8. I just moved to the neighbourhood so will definitely be coming back here! Looking forward to trying the burgers next time."}
{"text":"Well above average burger for an average price. 

Had a single SLAB with cheese. Sesame bun toasted and smashed patty cooked perfectly with good crust on both sides from cooking on the flat top. 

Decent selection of toppings include a couple non-standard toppings: sautéed mushrooms and habanero sauce! 

Didn't have any sides but the poutine looked standard and done properly. One minor thing with the menu was I wasn't able to find the Onion Rings so I didn't think they had them. After I paid I saw a small flyer that said they did. Oh well, next time. I'll definitely be back!  

There aren't many good burger joints on Bay Street so this one wins by default. It would take a serious competitor such as Burgers Priest or Holy Chuck though..."}
{"text":"I have been here once, i tried the American burger with fries.
The restaurant is not very clean, the table was kind of greasy, no one was cleaning the tables after the customers leave, but still you can eat your food.
The burger was very fatty and sweet, under seasoned , no additives to light up the taste, but the meat patty was delicious, juicy and caramelized from outside.
I would recommend it for people like greasy food.
i think it was overpriced, i paid 16 dollars for the combo which deserves maximum 12."}
{"text":"A co-worker introduced me to this place only this week. I went with a classic order of a single patty, with bacon & cheese (additional cost) tomato, lettuce and caramelised onion (all free) on a white bun with BBQ chipotle, which set me back around $9. One of my friends ordered a meal and offered to share her chips, so I was able to order in moderation (for once!).

The selection of free toppings was extensive and generous, service was fairly quick (10 mins) and cheerful. It did start to get busy after we ordered, I noticed they're on the Ritual app, so it might be worth ordering ahead if you're pressed for time.

For all those gluten conscious/allergic peeps, you can order a bun-less burger, another colleague had a wholewheat bun - so there are options a plenty for those who need them - me, there's not much I don't eat, so bring it on!

I found the meat to be tasty and juicy, the toppings were all fresh, I was devastated that I forgot to ask for pickles, so be sure to study those free add ons before ordering! The bun was of a more bread-y consistency than the more gourmet burgers of the times. Fries were a mix of crispy and slightly soggy (I am a slight-sog fan - so deal with it crunchy chip lovers) which was the perfect mix, you could tell they were from whole potatoes, some having their skin on - warning for those who are skin averse. 

Overall a decent burger, wouldn't say no to another lunch time excursion!"}
{"text":"Place was convenient from my work place and opened late. 

Ordered a double slab burger. Patties were moist and joocey to the bite. Toppings were free. Everything was fresh from the bun to the patty to the toppings."}
{"text":"I like the free topping choices here and it beats Hero Burger in terms of value. However, the burger is average and not life-changing. I've tried the poutine which was okay though it lacked seasoning and the fries could be crispier. 
It usually takes a long time for them to prep your order and this isn't a great place to sit down and eat so I always resort to take-out. It's a convenient place for me to fulfill a burger craving but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way for a visit."}
{"text":"Good burger but you're not saving any money when you buy the bacon cheeseburger. If bacon is $1 and cheese is $1 if you get both you should expect to pay no more than $2 extra for a bacon cheeseburger but it's actually $2.20 extra. I don't see the logic in that but whatevs.

The past couple of times I went the girls working didn't want to give me a cup of water. The first time she was hesitant and the second time a different girl said no and that I could buy something if I want. Uh yeah I just bought a burger. They don't want to give you free water they want you to buy it. Kind of sassy attitude too. So rude. The guy who works there is nice but he's been in the kitchen lately and I've had the pleasure of interacting with the rude girls who don't want to give me tap water.

The Big Smoke Burger up the street is much friendlier and has organic beef and higher quality toppings. And tap water! Imagine that! They're friendlier too."}
{"text":"One of THE best burgers I have ever had in Toronto. Love the free toppings. Excellent bacon cheese burger!"}
{"text":"One of the best burger joints I've ever been to.  They have a great selection of free toppings, the patties are fresh and delicious and the poutine is out of this world!  Not a whole lot of seating so don't come with a big group or at a busy time."}
{"text":"First time here today...all I can say is Very Impressed with the cheese burger, very fresh not dry and very tasty. I would say one of the best burgers I have ever tasted. Fries were ok looked like they were done on the outside but a little hard on the inside. I tell you though will be back for another burger! Well worth the price too!"}
{"text":"I liked this place alot.  Came here to try during burger week and his this one burger with pineapple slaw. It was greasy and delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered the bacon cheese melt sandwich for $6- barely any cheese or bacon between a grilled sesame burger bun. The girl working at the front was rude, lazy and clearly did not want to be at work. The man who made my sandwich was nice and I wanted to like this place but I can make a better grilled cheese for less $$. I also didn't feel too well after eating my grilled cheese. :("}
{"text":"Just discovered this place.  Like it.

The fries are GREAT.  They cut the potatoes themselves in the store.

The burgers are very good - NOT frozen beef.  The bun is nice and fresh - above average by a good bit.

I guess the standard is a double patty.  Just one is good for me.

It's nice that they let you request the burger not be burned to a crisp.

Good selection of FREE toppings - mushrooms and carmelized onions, etc.

Nice friendly helpful staff.  Had a nice small restaurant feel - sort of like going to moms for lunch.

Only complaint was the bacon was too crisp - but I'll ask next time for juicy.  Oh - only other complaint was I couldn't get the burger separate from the bun in tin foil so that I could take it all the way home and reheat the burger so the bun wouldn't be soggy.  (But I rushed home and the burger was extra fine when I plastered 6 strips of bacon and about 4 slices of cheese on it (from my own supply at home.) )"}
{"text":"I want my money back! Fries so greasy and soggy and burger so bland, need a little salt!"}
{"text":"Slab Burgers is absolutely delicious. Have been there twice in the past week just to try a few different things on the menu. I highly suggest getting the hotter than hell poutine (if you can handle the heat). It's loaded with gravy, cheese curds, jalapeño peppers, banana peppers, and topped off with some Cajun spice. I always go for the double burger with cheese loaded with some of the many toppings that Slab Burger has to offer. 
The staff are always nice and the food is always fresh! I would suggest calling in an order ahead of time because it can get a little busy from time to time."}
{"text":"Pros
- Big, thick patties, with just a bit of pink on the inside (i.e. not overcooked)
- Regular burger comes witih 2 patties!! 2 PATTIES!!
- Delicious
- Toppings menu keeps it simple
- Nice people behind the counter

Cons
- After having such a solid burger, I was kind of expecting big things from the poutine and it was just alright, nothing special. They use real cheese curds that squeak.

Bottom line
The burger hits the spot. It's got substance. You won't find McD prices, but these aren't McD burgers."}
{"text":"The burgers are fine. I've been twice. Both times the service was awful, which makes me never want to return considering the amount of great burger joints in this city. My order was wrong both times, and the girl taking our order was evidently taking personal calls on top of the nonchalant attitude we were offered. I know you're a simple burger joint, but employees who are dealing with the public like this make any place look bad."}
{"text":"Burgers are just average burgers. I got double slab and girlfriend got single bacon and cheese. The cheese is a kraft single which was disappointing considering they claim no fillers among other things. Fries tasted burnt to me but my girlfriend likes crispy fries so she enjoyed them. Overall not a great experience at this restaurant that seems like a copy of hero burger. Probably won't return. Bathrooms were really dirty staff don't seem to be there. Also we saw the cook blow his nose and not wash his hands... This review started at a three store but fell to two when I watched him blow his nose and not wash his hands"}
{"text":"A group of us came here for burger week and most of us got the Crispy Hawaii Burger which was supposed to be topped with pineapple chunks, crispy onions and crunchy bacon.
The other burger week option was the wasabi burger with wasabi mayo and lettuce.

The meat was okay, pretty good quality but under seasoned and kind of small compared to the size of the bun. The bun was probably the best part though some of my friends didn't think it paired well with the meat. All the toppings were in a heap in the middle of the burger and their flavours were kind of underwhelming. When you finally bit into the heap of toppings in the middle, it was SO much you couldn't taste any meat. The fries were WAY overdone and tasted like they were either re-fried or that they were using REALLY old oil.

There is no seating and the entire space is outrageously greasy - you feel like you need to have your pores scrubbed after waiting in line for 5 minutes (and since the service was so slow we were all in there for at least 20 min).

We were all pretty disappointed, even the guys who got the double said they were still hungry after. I know it's a discount burger during burger week but you'd think they would try and impress people so that we would come back, no?"}
{"text":"Had a slab burger combo, no cheese and comes out to be like $11. I ate in, the restaurant space is nothing special. Regular burger is a double patty, came with a lot of fries all on a real plate. The burger and fries were really good. Felt kind of gross though after finishing all my fries and the plate has lots of grease."}
{"text":"Quite good grub....
Our first visit here & we tried veggie & wild Alaskan burgers( burgers only no combo).
Both were good with fresh taste, nice option of  free toppings & nice buns.

Any day much better than hero burgers. Will visit again"}
