{"text":"Absolutely awesome. M Square serves a really nice espresso and does it with class!

(...and the fine gentlemen behind the bar were lovely to chat with!)"}
{"text":"Thoughtfully, carefully, lovingly prepared espresso at this spacious Third Wave coffee shop in the PATH under the Sheraton, with ample, comfortable seating right in the cafe. Wifi of course. And unusually for the PATH, it's easy to find -- right at the bottom of the elevator. 

The baristas are friendly, personable coffee geeks who very much know their stuff. It's really a shame that because of the location most of the customers will be tourists and business travelers. These guys deserve tons of regulars. 

Beans are from Phil & Sebastian (my favourite -- I nearly swooned when I saw it!) and Bows & Arrows from Victoria.The baked goods are suitably luxurious and didn't seem quite like the usual treats you generally see in the good downtown coffee shops, though I will have to investigate further to be sure. The Nutella muffin was quite delish but not habit-forming, thank god.

Great coffee, nice people, good treats are all very nice, but as a bonus M Square is the only good coffee shop in the neighbourhood open at 8AM on the weekend. I love them already."}
{"text":"Excellent delicious coffee with almond milk!  It's hard to find in the states and I wish we would catch up to the rest of the world.  Try the latte with almond milk for a great start to your day!"}
{"text":"Delicious lattes on the northern edge of the PATH. They brew Phil and Sebastian's. Come on, Toronto: give them some love!"}
{"text":"So glad I stumbled on this place. I had been looking for a new coffee place since I realised I hated the other \"indie\" place in the path (not Starbucks), and this is my new place. It's a bit out of the way from my office but I will go for the delicious latte and super friendly staff. Wonderful set up, clean, modern and not obnoxious. Love it."}
{"text":"Coffee was good, environment was nice. Location was rather difficult to get to. Wouldn't mind seeing a bigger selection of food."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. They don't deserve a one start..we were insulted and harassed by the supposedly manager of this place today.   

So I am a hip coffee place regular, and decided  with a friend to walk from work to this place he had tried before. We ordered two lactose free late to have in the place. The barista started to serve them to go, as according to him, we ordered them to go and also mentioning  coffee coups are dirty and not well washed,  so we said ok, will have them on cups to go. Then we noticed he was preparing  our  coffees with normal milk., when we explained to him our order. He went to the garbage to look for the order receipt and said we didn't pay 50 cents for one lactose free. We  handle the 50 cents and he started to toss  money .. yes.. money to us saying he don't need us to give him 50 cents. And then it went down hill,  throw us the money we paid back,  push one us from the place, even closed the store and follow us on the path - harassing us and said he will close security .. all of this  while us just keep looking at him -.. In one point as he was more and more aggressive and asked for the manger and 
 he answered that supposedly it was him ..
So if you are the manager reading this review you want to carefully chose your staff.  Someone passing by , who defended us, from this harassment pointed out this\"character\" was not the manager or owner.
Really sad/ horrible experience. 
We walked and went to nadege.. do yourself a favor go to other better service/ customer friendly place"}
{"text":"Love this new coffee shop on the Path. I pick up a cup of coffee (occasionally a cappuccino) on my way to work. Coffee quality is definitely very high and the baristas are super friendly, it's a refreshing dose of caffeine and good energy to start my day!"}
{"text":"Excellent! 

The coffee is always fantastic, no matter how you order it. Try the cortado (kind of a large macchiato), for something really happy. 

The staff are always friendly and are quick to recognise repeat customers and their favourite orders."}
{"text":"Hidden in the underground PATH, the quickest way to get here is by going inside the Sheraton Hotel on Queen, take the escalators downstairs to the underground level, and there you are! Right across a sad lottery booth. There is ONE barista who SMILES and the rest just act like they're too cool for school in their plaid. I am giving 5 stars because the guy who smiles makes my heart melt and the lattes are really good. SMILE MORE, YOU GOOFS, SO I WILL COME BACK MORE OFTEN."}
{"text":"Real hipster coffee in a long neglected part of the PATH.  Where once there was 90s d√©cor and kitsch underneath the Sheraton, it feels like the place has finally made it into the 21st century.

Prices are quite reasonable, with many beverages at the $3 price point.  The baristas seem to be easy to get along with, and is attracting a loyal fanbase.

I'm glad M Square is slowly turning around the coffee scene in the PATH along with SJCB."}
{"text":"Crazy nice baristas that take the time to explain the difference between $2 and $4 coffees. Bright espresso and big smiles :)"}
{"text":"UPDATE: I am reviewing the rating to upgrade to 4 stars, this place definitely has the consistency and the taste to be a solid coffee shop (updates in CAPS).

This a new establishment in the run-down basement of the Sheraton Hotel.

location 4/5  located at a very busy corner or the PATH system, where richmond st tunnel/path meets with the york st tunnel/path.hopefully paves way for lots of visitors..

the place 3.5/5 It is a coffee shop with a modern attempt to incorporate some rustic pieces, such as the steel/iron bar chairs as well as barn board/beam wood pieces throughout. there are places to sit, although it feels a little too spacious to be cozy inside, and there is definitely not enough inside to keep your eyes occupied, and you end up staring at the disgusting rundown path hallway.

price 4/5 The coffee is definitely at the higher midpoint of the coffee chain hierarchy, close to starbucks prices and possibly even dinneen coffee co. (UPGRADED TO 4 BASED ON SURVEY OF NEW  OTHER COFFEE SHOPS)

I got a small latte, and have also tried other latte options, such as almond, and have also ordered americanos and espresso.

The coffee 4/5.. taste is quite strong, and it seems like the coffee is of good quality, noting the oil in the drink as a sign of fresh and decent coffee.  (UPGRADE TO 4 BASED ON CONSISTENCY)

service 4/5 nice servers. 

overall I enjoyed the spirit of the place, as it is a step in the right direction to revitalize that area of the PATH, but the place itself needs so work in terms of its interior and potentially a re-working of its pricing, because that area of the path will not have a high traffic area of the \"bay street\" high earner types that this place is catering too. Potentially the hotel visitors would frequent here."}
{"text":"Have been going there almost daily for two years now. Awesome coffee and obsessive attention to every detail. Love the extra creamy milk that they use from Sheldon Creek Farms. Really makes a difference. A little hard to find in the PATH beside the entrance to the Sheraton. All the baristas are great."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get one's coffee fix in the desolate for years for a  java fix in PATH (Sam James has helped).  Kind of on the end of the path a bit hard to spot if you don't know about them as the signage is hard to read.
This review is solely based on my cappuccino that I tried here. 
Here is the verdict
Espresso: Medium
Crema': Good
Milk: Frothed Well
Latte Art: Good
I would say a solid 4 stars. Didn't get a chance to try their other offering but I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee, espresso, and my favorite, cappuccino. The coffee, AND their high quality milk make the big difference! If you're not from around here, it is NOT on street level, rather it is down in the underground shopping area that also connects a lot of the downtown buildings  (PATH).
All of the baristas are super friendly and knowledgable. They are more than happy to answer your questions. They even have cortado on their menu. Don't know what that is? Ask! And then enjoy one. :)"}
{"text":"Every time I'm here on business I stay at a hotel that has PATH access and then head straight here for all of my coffee needs. 

Great espresso and friendly/knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"Amazing espresso based beverages. I can't stand Starbucks or other big chains. I will not stand in a lineup of over 2 ppl for aN espresso and have to fight cheapskates on their laptops sucking up free so fi. Staff here know their beans and they even served me my latte in a swanky cup that wouldn't burn my hands. As a person with very sensitive hands, I appreciate this."}
{"text":"My friend who's a huge coffee guy introduced me to this place and I have been a regular ever since. I got to say that this is definitely the best place to grab espresso drinks in the PATH. If it was located a little closer to my office tower I'd go there daily."}
{"text":"This place is seriously overrated. Was the only one in line at 9am and the cashier was too busy on her cell phone to even acknowledge me. Typically you'd expect the cashier to say \"Hello, what can I get you,\" however, this chick was heads down furiously texting.

As for the other chick making my coffee, was she a mute? Totally worked like she had a dgaf attitude. 

Never coming back and will be walking down the street to starbucks"}
{"text":"First time visiting Toronto from Florida and this is the best coffee shop!! Everything, from customer service to the coffee, was amazing! Also, the baristas are very knowledgable about the coffee. Picked up a \"keep cup\", which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Rude server and awful drinks. Matcha tea is undrinkable and the tea is scorching hot. Don't recommend"}
{"text":"Ordered and paid for two medium drip coffee.
Sat down. 
Waited. 
Waited. 
Waited. 
Me \"we are still waiting for our coffee\"
Lady \"did you order already and pay?\"
Me \"yyyyyes\"

Lady gives two medium coffee.
Me \"can I have almond milk\"

{"text":"Amazing espresso drinks. The flat white is incredible. It's a bit difficult to find - it is in an underground mall, but worth the walk for sure."}
{"text":"Love this coffee place in the path and is super close to my workplace!  Cute little coffee shop at the corner of a relatively older part of the path but great space for small groups to hang out while enjoying some coffee!

Had their lattes and flat white before and both were super smooth.  Coffee flavour was not bitter and the amount of milk in the latte and flat white were perfect.  Top it off with a nice latte art and there is your well-made latte at a fairly competitive price.

If only the view is a little nicer, otherwise, this would of been a 5 stars for sure!!"}
{"text":"Friendly, accommodating..
Refreshing when customer service is pleasent.
Flat white was excellent."}
{"text":"Hipsters serving coffee to executives.  Gotta love it.  I'm an old school drip coffee guy.  I don't need special coffee.  Their prices are ridiculous.  Seems out of place here.  The owner is Whiney."}
{"text":"A haven on the PATH - fantastic cappuccino and nice place to sit and watch people."}
{"text":"Strong overpriced coffee. Definitely handcrafted and one level up from Starbucks, with prices to match. That being said I loved this cute coffee shop. The quality speaks for itself. If you have problems with $ that's why it's -1 star. But I think the prices actually contribute to the coffee-snob-ish vibes here."}
{"text":"Cute space, tasty coffee, friendly staff. 

nothing more to say except I enjoy coming here - I hope to try some of their pastries. 

Keep Eating, 

Angela"}
{"text":"Ordered a couple of drip coffees and waited a 5 mins with no response. When the staff realized we did not receive our order and asked for almond milk she seemed put off that we were asking. Poor guest service, not welcoming and no apology for their mistake. Coffee was ok nothing special."}
{"text":"All hail M Square - it gets my highly coverted award of best coffee place in the Financial District/on the PATH. It's probably a good thing I don't work closer or else I'd be there every day.

PROS:
- Excellent coffee: good crema, nice latte art, just the right note on the espresso
- Friendly guys behind the counter
- Consistency across baristas - I've been so many times and not a sub par coffee in site
- Seating: it is nice to have somewhere to chill out in the PATH at lunch that isn't Starbucks or a food court (and I love those ergonomic stools at the counter)
- Wifi: because Telus can be a bit flaky under the ground
- Nice presentation: I do admire their espresso with a shot of soda water and fancy teapots, both presented on lovely wooden boards
- Almond milk: thanks for accommodating my hipster, non-dairy needs

CONS
- Being on the PATH means no natural lighting. However, downtown this is perfectly acceptable and protects us from the abominable snowman of winter. Most of the Bay Streeters seem perfectly content whiling away the summer months in the TD food court as it is.

Also, they have their own app. At first I thought it was a loyalty app but it seemed to be more like the Starbucks one where you load credit. I found it a little confusing."}
{"text":"Kind of funny to see this joint among the lamo shops under the Sheraton Centre -- definitely the cool kid on the block! Dropped in as I was passing by and glad I did - really great cappuccino, albeit very small for $4. Friendly baristas and hip decor. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I visited on a Tuesday afternoon around 12:30 PM. I ordered a latte, of average size, which totalled $4.15 with taxes included. 

The space is nice enough, with a rustic feel, but it wouldn't be my first choice for a prolonged visit. Because the shop is located right in the PATH (near the Richmond-Adelaide food court) in the basement of the Sheraton Centre, there is absolutely no natural lighting - so beware, if you're coming to people-watch, you won't be doing so out of a window (read: there are none). The coffee itself was nice, and I can appreciate that the coffee wasn't bitter, going down quite smoothly. Yet, while it was perfectly fine, it was still, to me, only perfectly \"average.\"

Perhaps I'll stop by again if I'm in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to try this again unless I'm nearby."}
{"text":"A solid machiato when roaming the underground path downtown. Even on a to go cup they put an art design. Lots of seats nearby to enjoy your drink. I think it was around $4.50"}
{"text":"I have heard so much about M Square and on a short visit to Toronto I finally got the chance to stop and see what all the rave was about... And I am so glad I did!! From the taste and smooth texture of the coffee to the nice and warm service this is by far the BEST coffee spot in Toronto!! And when you come in make sure to order a Brookie while you are at it :) so good!!!!"}
{"text":"The best coffee in Toronto by miles. The location is less than ideal and easy to miss but if you find it, you will be rewarded. There is another coffee shop that I know it can compete with this and that one is in Montreal."}
{"text":"If you're willing to pay a stupid amount of money for a perfectly executed latte (like me), this is a place where you can do that!  I found their brewed coffee no better than what most (good) places serve, but the latte...

For what it's worth, easiest way to find this place is to enter the PATH from the main lobby of the Sheraton..."}
{"text":"Latte is still delicious...but waited 12 minutes when the place is nearly empty + no one in line to order."}
{"text":"Great cortado, it's all I ever get so I can't comment on anything else. Efficient and friendly service.  The only thing I don't like is their loyalty program. I don't want to carry an extra card just for one shop that has one outlet. Wish they partnered up with existing programs like Vicinity. Besides that, very happy to have another gourmet coffee shop within the area."}
{"text":"Try this place if you have 15 - 20 min to spare. Even when there isn't a line up, the service is super slow, and you have to repeat your basic \"muffin and coffee\" order two or three times."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  So a nearly a year later and we tried it again.  What was a winner last time just proved to not be consistent over time.  

Hidden in the underground PATH of the Sheraton Hotel is M Squared.  Bathed in an ugly yellow light, it does have cozy seating and many bar seating to give most quick caffeine fixes a spot to rest before moving on.  On a quiet Saturday, there wasn't many patrons sitting here but a constant little stream of take out.  I can see why they'd only have one barista... there is not a lot of foot traffic here.  

Though there wasn't a lot of foot traffic, I would be honest and say drinks are made with care and careful detail.  This would translate to things taking longer than other spots.  So if you're expecting Starbucks speed, you'll be disappointed.  That being said, I did find the pacing here slower than other independent coffee spots around Toronto.   It's not quick here that's for sure.

Flat White - A decent attempt at the flat white.  I found this was imbalanced with too much almond milk to espresso.  This one was not as strong or flavourful as other flat whites.  I also found the beans used to be a bit herbal so it wasn't as enjoyable as the ones I would normally enjoy from other spots. 3.5/5

Chai Latte - This was the drink that made us fall for this spot the first time.  They still create their own teas here for the latte so it's not premixed.  I totally appreciate that.  Another thing is that the chai latte here is strong in a good way.  You're never wondering if you're drinking steamed milk.  The challenge I had with this drink is the flavour... rather than a balanced spiced mix, it is a overly strong 'in your face' star anise (aka. licorice).  I didn't enjoy the flavour very much but I can appreciate they do their own tea. 3.5/5

A while ago, this would be the only decent option near the City Hall and I would recommend this over the corporate Starbucks but with Tokyo Smoke and Bulldog just a tiny street over, I would say M Square is a decent option but certainly not the best anymore."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee! Great presentation and super friendly baristas! If you are in Toronto...this place is worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Just because you're in a prime Path location and serving Bay street types doesn't mean you should float on all the reviews of your Yelp friends. The Americano at McDonald's is just as good and the stale pastry better. And it's half the price at Mcds. Sorry, I'm just telling it like it is. 
One positive. The staff are very friendly and upbeat."}
{"text":"If you are in the area near City Hall and need decent coffee this is a good spot. If you are looking for the best latte or americano and have time to walk I would say look elsewhere."}
